B000AP04FG|3.0|I enjoy both of these performers, although I can see why they have their detractors.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining enough, however, because of the gimmic, it's hardly more than a rental.<br /><br />Some decent action, but definately another movie relying too much in the special effects department and not enough in the solid story, solid plot, solid dialog, etc., departments.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is such a beautiful character study of two men, living in a part of the country, and a time, in which their immense and passionate love for one another was simply not understood.  It shows so tenderly how they struggle to maintain lives which fit the accepted norms, and only end up damaging the happiness of not only themselves, but their wives as well.  More importantly as the film slowly treks across twenty years in the lives of these men, we see how this experience changes them, and how Ennis's character, in particular, grows over the years. Incredibly acted, poignantly told, everyone should see this film.  It is about as close to perfection as a movie can be.
B000A2H812|4.0|What could I say about this high-voltage crossbreed of Sid Viscious, the Iron Curtain and the balalaika   that hasn't been said much more eloquently in the other reviews? (Ok, so I don't even know what a balalaika looks like, but you got the idea.)Only those listeners deadened by years of corporate twaddle produced by air-brushed american idols, belly button spears, and crack ho aguilera will be able to resist the manic energy that is Gogol Bordello. Lead singer Hutz is as wild and unruly as his moustache and is twice as much fun. These songs betray a smorgasboard of influences (is it just me or does anyone else hear a tinge of Big Audio Dynamite in \\"Not A Crime?\\") while producing music that is uniquely their own. If you can't catch them live, Gogol Bordello's infectious musical rampages are they next best thing - sort of like having the soundtrack to that wild party that you talk about for years to come. <br /> <br />I gave this album only four stars 'cause I would have to reserve the five stars for \\"Voi-La Intruder\\" which I like even better. <br /> <br />P.S. I also add my agreement to one of the other reviewer's recommendation of Devotchka.
B000CDINOK|5.0|Excellent DVD from what has to be one of the most exciting bands around.  Unfortunately, contrary to what Amazon says, the DVD is region 2 (Europe, Japan etc).  After contacting Bibi at Music Media, who was very helpful and accomodating I kept the DVD to play on my computer only.  When and if a region 1 DVD becomes available I will indeed purchase it for big screen veiwing!
0440237688|4.0|I began the book feeling at ease. The context was similiar to the movie Pleasantville and many events were predictable. I thought this was an appropriate book for middle school students. I felt this was an enjoyable book, until I read about the Release. I was appalled to hear that people were murdered because they did not fit into the \\"perfect\\" society. This book is directed towards middle school children and I feel the ending passages are not appropriate for younger children to be reading.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I absolutely ADORE the film and Love Joaquin Phoenix. I hope he wins AN Oscar because the Role of Johnny Cash, is completely different to what Joaquin usually acts as. Reese Witherspoon was extraordinary, and her singing has made me want to sing. <br />I have the album and I know every word to every song. I wasn't a Johnny Cash fan before this movie, but now I'm buying his CDs. <br /> <br />How's that for an influencial movie! <br />
B00082IJ08|4.0|Literally stumbled onto this in my nephew's room.  Why does anyone care who makes the music?  Its solid.  Its got a sense of humor.  A great change of pace for us old rockers.  Totally accessable, no matter what music planet you come from. Even the beatles had a cartoon show.  Did their fans go away?  See you in the next(o green) world...
0553103547|5.0|I have read several reviews, good and bad, about this series since I began reading A game of Thrones about a week ago. I would like to say that I have read fantasy for around 15 years now and as I have grown older I have become more discriminating with my fantasy novels. One thing has always remained true throughout all of those years though, a good story is a good story. A good story keeps you turning the pages, wanting to read one just a few more before turning in. This story does that.<br /><br />  Some of these reviews make me laugh, people feel the need to instruct everyone of what GRRM is attempting to do or not do and why his writing style is for crap. Who decides how a good story must flow or be presented?  I thought that fell into the catagory of craft. His books are popular and they are huge sellers, readers must enjoy them. I realize some people feel the need to rip apart anything that is popular so they can seem more insightful than the rest of us but give me a break.  The bottom line is its a engrossing, fresh fantasy novel that is fun to read.
B000BYA4JM|4.0|I love Madonna, but even I know she's not the greatest actress. Fact is, in some movies she's completely blank-faced, as if she's waiting for the director to tell her what she should be feeling right then. That's what makes Who's That Girl, in a way, refreshing. The film itself is a bit of a mess, and the climax gets way too silly for it's own good. But for most of the film you get Madonna at her acting best, and I mean it. She's funny, with good comic timing, and she's completely believable. She and Griffin Dunne make a great team and make the film zip right along. Those who think of Madonna as the worst actress around need to give this film another look because they're missing out. Why Madonna doesn't do more films like this is beyond me. She's at her best when she's having fun and not trying so hard to be taken seriously. I'll take a Who's That Girl performance over an Evita performance any day (though she was good in that too).
0895260131|5.0|Reflective of its title, this book is politically incorrect and may disturb some readers as it does ask questions that some are afraid to. This book, along with the other two Politically Incorrect books of the set, dares to explore parts of Islam that true Muslims don't want you to know!  The real tragedy of Islam is that many millions of people claim Islam as their faith, but they do not truly know what their own religion is all about.  <br /> <br />Take a moment and ask yourself if you really believe all of the peaceful and loving mentions of Islam you've heard.  Have you actually read the Qur'an, or do you just accept what you're told about this religion?   <br /> <br />One of the best parts of this book is that it provides proof directly from the Qur'an about Muhammed's true doctrine of terror.  This is not a book that preaches hatred toward Muslims or one that rants and raves about the evil of Islam without giving proof.  This is a book that exposes Islam with every piece of proof you will need to research this yourself and come to the same conclusion!  Dare to read and learn instead of accepting what we're fed by people with an agenda! <br /> <br />Highly recommended to all! <br />
B00005JKJA|2.0|This movie is in IMDb's top 250 list, and it shouldn't be. There are many movies that I disagree with being on that list, but I can start to understand why they're there. For starters, they're movies with coherent plots that don't require \\"clues\\" from the director himself to understand.<br /><br />I first saw this movie about a year and a half ago, the plot was so unnecessarily twisted and the ending so unresolved and incomprehensible that I just assumed that I had missed something along the way, and didn't bother with this again for a year and a half. Well, this movie is so highly regarded, I figured I'd better be fair and give this another shot. This time there was no confusing it, I was left with violent feelings toward the director. Make that FIVE hours of my life David Lynch has stolen.<br /><br />People who defend this movie claim it has one of the most intricate, multi-faceted story lines ever, and that that's the beauty of the movie, the symbolism and all that crap. Had the director not given you those 10 clues, would you have figured it out yourself? Well if you did, then that's your version of the story, and chances are, you're wrong. There are many movies that are open-ended and left to the viewer to interpret, but the difference here is that this ENTIRE movie is open, not just the ending. You might as well let people write their own scripts if it's gonna be like that. That's like showing an inkblot to people, only the mentally deranged will declare that black blotch a masterpiece.<br /><br />Any movie that requires external intervention to even start to grasp meanings behind it is the result of a poor effort. Your movie has failed if it can't stand up on its own, and instead, relies on its viewers to take a trip to the fourth dimension in search of answers and return sweating and out of breath with the most convoluted explanations of symbolism. I think it's safe to say that your movie is reaching a bit if we need to do that.<br /><br />You know what, all arguments are moot when we consider the fact that this movie was the result of a failed pilot for ABC. When ABC declined to pick this up for a series, David Lynch then went back a year later and added more scenes and turned it into a movie. What we're left with is not some grand idea or vision that was meticulously planned out, no, this piece of crap is nothing more than what was able to be SALVAGED from his original 8 million dollar failed effort. And people are calling this a masterpiece...<br /><br />This reminds me of another institution in our culture in which non-independent thinkers disregard facts, or the lack thereof, to be in accordance with what the masses are telling them to believe.ider the fact that this movie was the result of a failed pilot for ABC.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|If you've already seen season 1, buying season 2 is a MUST! Actually, I would be surprised if anyone who has seen season 1 hasn't seen season 2 yet. Luckily I purchased both of these season sets at the same time. The extreme emotional cliffhanger on the finale of season 1 was hard enough without having to wait for season 2 to arrive so I could see what happened. Like I said, I'm glad I purchased both at the same time!    Well, rest assured that things get back to 'normal' in the OC right off the bat during this season! But, like any fan will know, 'normal' in the OC is a little different than you might expect. I don't want to spoil too much, but I can't resist spilling a few of the obvious details. Ryan and Seth are back as the unbeatable Newport Harbor duo, but what will Marissa and Summer's reactions be? Remember, Ryan left back to Chino to be with Teresa and the baby.  And Seth couldn't bare to lose his best friend after his life had changed so much for the better, so he left everyone behind as he sailed into the Pacific.  All the answers are in the premier, so watch and see.    Naturally, the second season is filled with just as many surprises as the first, but you'll have to watch it to find out more. For any OC fan, this is a must! If you've thought about watching The O.C., but you don't think you'd like it, just give it a try and you won't be sorry! Please, though, buy both seasons together and you'll thank yourself later! Don't get caught in that cliffhanger without being able to pop in the first disc of season two. After you watch one episode of The O.C., you'll see what I mean!    Highly recommended to all!
630025111X|5.0|The song by Mama Cass at the beginning of this show is the story of Monte's life;  \\"I'm not about to come unhinged when everything goes wrong\\".  This movie depicts the rough edged life that cowboys endured.  Monte's time is running out though.  He is going to have to find a new occupation.  Near the end of the show Monte sees a horse in town that \\"Shorty\\" couldn't break.  He mounts it and breaks it but nearly destroys the town doing it.  A man who gives wild west shows sees him and is impressed with his riding.  He offers Monte to join his show, but he'll have to be \\"Texas Jack\\".  The money is good but Monte can't do it.  \\"I'm not gonna spit on my whole life\\", he says.
B000002UB3|5.0|The second side of the album features a medley which may be the best sequence of songs in recording history.  You Never Give Me Your Money' is a personal favorite.
1881273156|5.0|This book is very accurate and useful.  I'm giving it to people after they reach the five year mark of their relationship to help them learn how to communicate better.  It really helped mine.
0553801503|2.0|This installment seems more crude and vulgar than earlier installments.  The \\"F\\" word is bandied about like it is candy for children.  Cersei's lesbian encounter served to show that she is confused without Jaime-- but the repetitive fondling of breasts, threats of rape, discussions of old crone's examining maidenheads, etc. do not further the story. Rather, they make us wonder if George has been wandering the porn theaters of his hometown rather than writing this long awaited novel. <br /> <br />The Wonderful World we saw in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" has disappeared, sucked into the vacuum of a non-progressing story with an overwhelming number of MINOR, NON-IMPORTANT characters to keep track of.  Other than the last thirty pages, the story is about as exciting as an Al Gore speech. <br /> <br />Martin would do well to hand this story over to another writer to ghost-write it.  His editor continues to let him wander. <br /> <br />There is no real fantasy in the story.  No magic, no mythical creatures, etc. with the exception of an undead character and constant rumors of dragons somewhere out there. <br /> <br />If you really want to read this book, I recommend it be checked out of the library, or purchased from a used bookstore.  Even the paperback price would be twice what it is worth. <br /> <br />What a shame.  It just began to wander.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|As a purist of book-to-movie adaptations, I had a hard time enjoying the good points of this movie because I got too caught up in the period discrepancies and creative liberties taken with the original story.  First, they made the Bennetts look only a notch above white trash.  Second, Bingley came across as clueless, gullible, and kind of pathetic instead of naive and hopelessly optimistic.  Third (and most annoying in my opinion) they took away much of the formality that existed during that time in society, and between men and women specifically.  That formality is the main source of the humor and irony that makes Jane Austen's stories so entertaining- since people can't say what they mean, or run up to the person of their dreams and plant a kiss, they have to do everything in a more cloak and dagger way.  The dialog has to be much sharper than today's lazy screenplays to convey the same feelings and emothions.  After I stopped fuming over these issues, I decided to see the movie again to see if I would enjoy it more without such specific expectations.  The second time around, I was able to appreciate the acting much more, especially Keira Knightley.  I also found that I actually liked the portrayel of Jane- in the BBC miniseries, she seems a bit blind in her desire to believe the best in people; in this version, she comes across as a bit more aware.  Despite some of the effects of \\"creative liberty\\", I did enjoy this movie- not the best adaptation, but very respectable.
B00007ELEL|4.0|It is a good comedy, however, recommended only for people with coarse interests, not for civilized humanity.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I am a HUGE LOTR fan (they're my all-time favorite films) so when I heard that Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson was remaking the classic King Kong I was unsurprisingly ecstatic (how could this film go wrong?) The 3 hour length didn't bother me at all and the film was simply, well, amazing! The special effects were great (especially the CGI look of Kong), the acting was superb (props go to Watts and Black for convincingly pulling off their performances, especially the latter who I had doubts about.) I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a classic adventure story set admist a creepy island infested with bizarre prehistoric inhabitants. FIVE STARS!!
0440241588|1.0|Awful!!!  120 pages of this guy Backman learning Italian.  What a waste of money!! I threw it in the garbage!!!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is such a superb CD.  Technically this is the bands' 4th album and those who are, or will be, purchasing this album are more than likely fans already.  But this release should catch some newcomers' attention as well. <br /> <br />Just marvelous music contained on this disc.  These guys are so awesome.  Their music just literally takes you to places within your mind.  So many instruments and sounds to keep your mind busy and the lyrics fill things in nicely.  Yes, yes it is in the Icleandic toungue but that does not take away from their music whatsoever.  You can also find english translatsions to their songs on the internet ([...] <br /> <br />The only difference I can find compared to their previous two commercial releases is that you can kind of hear the differentiation in the track numbers on this CD.  The others just blended beautifully together where as this tends to be a little more distinct.  Not a bad thing, just a slight difference worthy of noting. <br /> <br />I back the purchase of this album 100%.  I would also encourage an attendence of a live show.  AWESOME!!  Another wonderful musical composition from a band that has no end for adjectives to describe them.  Thanks for reading and I hope for your sake that you purchase and listen and enjoy this music.  Great stuff.
B00005B36H|5.0|Every Tool fan would probably agree with me but we all know that this is not possible.  I,m not going to try to explain how far from \\"normal\\" this album is, but I think that every other band out there right now, is so secretly jealous of tool and they are to cool to admit so.  Anyway i feel sorry for anyone who has pased over this album or only listened to it once on some crappy mini cd player or something.  Lateralus should have came with directions for listening for everyone who doesnt get it.  But then again im happy that people pass over it because it just makes me that much more thankful to have been \\"enlightened\\" with this epic record.  I truely believe that one day in the future, it will be discussed as the most incredible album of all time that was passed up for many years before people other than tool fans began to \\"get it.\\"
0440237688|5.0|When I was first told about the book The Giver I was skeptical about it. I wasn't sure the book would really be good. To be honest I sat down and after reading just a few pages I was hooked. Lowry has the ability to pull you into this world and make you feel for the characters. Not only do you feel like you know the characters, but you feel like you're in this community. While this idea of a \\"perfect community\\" seems a little far-fetched at times I think it could actually be a real place. With the things going on in the world now and in the past I can see why someone would want to create a world to escape to. While I wouldn't want to live in a place like that I can see why some others would. Jonas and all the other kids seemed generally happy and so did the adults. Everyone had everything they needed and no one complained. In this book Lowry creates a captivating society that just pulls you in until the very end. <br />
B00005JOT1|4.0|Oscar's Wilde play `Lady Windermere's Fan.'has been transferred into a decent movie from the British director Mike Barker (`To Kill a King'). This is all about a humorous brilliant production with an outstanding cast as Wild deserves.<br /><br />Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a middle age experienced woman who is desperate to find money to support her luxurious way of living. She goes in the Italian country side where she is picking up her victims. There she will meet the ideal victims a just married couple the innocent Lady Windermere (Scarlet Johansson), and her husband Lord Windermere (Mark Umbers. In the scene there is a devoted admirer (Tom Wilkinson), and a man really close to Mrs. Erlynne Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore. Secrets stories rumors will create a good movie more funny and less melodramatic all these dressed with beautiful romantic costumes and always with the background of the 19th century.<br /><br />I recommend it have fun
B000001FRY|4.0|With their classic opening rocker, \\"I Will Follow,\\" U2 began their glorious journey into the rock music history books with their 1980 debut, \\"Boy.\\" This first album from Dublin's favorite sons is U2 in the raw, without the bigger studio productions of the band's later work. What comes through the most on \\"Boy\\" is the urgency & power of U2's musical attack: The Edge's unique, wailing guitar-work, the towering sound from the rhythm section of bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr., and, of course, the soaring, magnificent voice of lead singer Bono. The band rock with everything they got on great songs like \\"I Will Follow,\\" \\"An Cat Dubh,\\" \\"Stories For Boys,\\" \\"Another Time Another Place,\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\", but they also take time for some great moments of beauty, like \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Shadows And Tall Trees.\\" Though there was certainly room for musical growth, and most U2 fans agree that the band's best music was yet to come (and opinions vary greatly on this subject---\\"War,\\" \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" appear to be the top fan favorites), there's no question that \\"Boy\\" is an excellent debut album for Bono & company. Get ready, world---U2 have arrived!
B000088DTS|5.0|If you are fairly new to discovering Australia biggest talent Delta Goodrem, you have found GOLD!!!  If you have heard \\"Lost Without you\\" and love it than you must buy this cd!  All the songs are great and you may even think of Celine Dion for a moment, but Delta is unique and sings with such beauty and grace. <br /> <br />You won't be sorry with this purchase and will then have to collect everything Delta(like I have)!!!!
0385504209|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but then, again, I knew I was reading fiction.<br /><br />I do think the controversy this book has stirred is most fascinating.  He did a great job with the \\"secret, forbidden\\" stuff--it made for a good story if you like a nice \\"scavenger-hunt\\" mystery.  As I was reading it, I knew those who are a wee bit fanatical about their religion would be offended.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Brown was deliberately too liberal with taking \\"poetic licenses\\"  or not.  But, for those out there who think that this book is true, just a little research or even a couple of shows on A & E will clear up quite a bit of that for you.<br /><br />If you like fiction that is just fiction, read it.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I didn't want to see this movie in the theaters because I hadn't heard that great of reviews from it but when my uncle decided to lend it to me I said why not.  After seeing it and giving it back to my uncle I decided to buy it strait away.  The movie starts in France with a blacksmith named Balin (Bloom) that has just lost his wife and his father finally reveals himself to his son.  Godfrey (Neeson) takes his son with him to the Holy City but on the way he is mortaly wounded in a fight to protect his son.  He gives over his possesions to his son and tells him to protect the king and the people.  It then follows Balin to Jerusalem and it's struggle between two kings Baldwin (Norton) and Saladin (Massoud).  A very interesting historical film that has great special features that tells the history with the movie if you select to do so.  I highly suggest this film.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This is a great 2 disc dvd.The film is one of Ridley Scott's best and is almost up there with Gladiator. I say almost, because I know that the movie was heavily edited for time and that many scenes were cut.I look forward an uncut version of the film shown as it should have run in the theatres originally. The A&E and History Channel specials on the second disc make it a fantastic addition to the film. It is nice to see fact vs fiction. Can anyone tell me if they plan to release an expanded edition of the film?
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This is an instant cult classic.  I decided to pick up this movie after much hype and I thought why not.  So I watched it and was instantly amazed.  The acting for one is very nicely done and i eagerly awaited the second one and was so happy when I saw it.  The special features are a great watch because they go into such good detail on how they made the movie and the costumes that they used.  The story of Vampires vs. Werewolves has been made before but never as well I think as this movie has made it.  A must see film for the science fiction genre lover.
0895260131|5.0|I read this book with some recalcitrance.  I'm a liberal, and I tend to think we are all going down different paths in our search for God.<br /><br />I read this book in one setting - I was hypnotized.  There's not a bored or useless moment spent reading this book. The history is superb, and the religious comparisions very eye opening.  I especially liked the juxtaposition of the Christian stories with the Islamic.<br /><br />As someone who welcomes diversity, yet cannot tolerate the intimidation that I've witnessed against Rushdie and now Denmark, I didn't WANT to believe the things that were said, yet, in the back of my mind, I remembered so many alarming things that have happened over the news, and, with the cartoon controvery raging, I found myself pushed right from my tolerance seat.<br /><br />The book unnerved me.  I got a Koran.  I started looking - I checked the news sites for references.  The author has done a great job presenting the facts - facts NO one ever tells us.<br /><br />Every person that values his Western Heritage of Reason should read this book.  No exceptions.  Liberals like me FIRST.  It is hard medicine, but it is needed.
B000BT97AO|2.0|i too waited a couple of years to see this film arrive in the USA, and wanted to love this film so very much.  i've always loved Dave and Niel's work in the past, and i expected this to be no less wonderful.  sadly, i left feeling empty.  while the efforts and the visuals were worth a rental, the storyline took Mirrormask to the edge of what could have been a hugely successful masterpiece and dumbed it down.  it is too scary and dark for young kids, too wierd for tweens, too childish for adults.  with more defined dialog and a coherant plot, the film could have been a classic for all ages.  this just seems like a spoiled rotten little kid dressed up for the fancy ball with no one to take them there.  i for one, am greatly disapointed.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|So much has already been written concerning this marvelous show, and most of it is accurate.  The one realisation that was overly apparent to me after viewing this DVD is that Jack Bruce will forever be paradoxical in that he is a tremendous vocalist/bassist, yet so little of his work is known to the average rock fan, with the obvious exception of the Cream material, so it is good to have so much of the show included here.  Also, Bruce is the best bassist that Clapton has played with in decades that is as proficient instrumentally as Clapton, himself, has become, and this result is incredible!  All three of these musicians are impressive, and this fact is clear thoughout the show, but Jack Bruce has few peers on the four-string,and it is great to watch the two of them work together here.<br /><br />I am not certain if this performance is better than the work Jack Bruce did with Peter Frampton on three Cream songs on Ringo's fourth tour, but each effort in that show is also wonderful as well.  Frampton comes closer to playing with Eric's style than any other guitarist I have seen, and the arrangement they use for \\"Sunshine\\" is more dramtic than this new one, (though all three versions are stunning).  Also, the new show omits \\"I Feel Free\\" which is not the case on the Ringo Concert, and it might ought to have been included here.<br /><br />Whatever conclusion drawn comparitively, the new DVD is one that I have played repeatedly, and it has yet to fail to keep me well entertained throughout!  I have the same appreciation for this show that I would have had if a Beatles Reunion had been possible with all the original members involved.  Cream was about as close as any other band has come to having had the impact on the music world as the Beatles had.  I applaud all of the people involved for giving this grand reunion to the fans.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It has taken years for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be topped, but here it is in all it's glory! North & South with Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage is absolutely one of the finest movies that BBC has done and I thank them for it.  I watched it three times before I finally decided to wait another week to watch it again!  Daniela Denby-Ashe played her part beautifully and Richard Armitage will more than likely be boosted to stardom for his portrayal of Mr. Thornton.<br /><br />This is an absolute \\"must see\\" movie and then you will definitely be glad you bought it for all times.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I bought this DVD the same day that it was released, same with Saw 2 yesterday. I have to say that this movie is superb and very refreshing when it comes to the horror genre. I have seen the movie many times and haven't grown tired of it once. The story and actors are so well done, you will be glued to the screen the entire time. I'm not promising that this film will be scary, it's creepy but more of a thriller than actual monsters giving you nightmares.<br /><br />Carey Elwes, Danny Glover and every other person does an excellent job in their roles and you feel for every single character and understand where they are coming from, even the Jigsaw Killer. Yes, there is a twist in the film and I have to tell you, I never saw it coming. Tobin Bell, the one who plays the villian of the film, said that the twist alone is the reason he likes the movie.<br /><br />So go get this DVD, you won't be disappointed, the best new  thriller/horror movie I have seen in a long long time.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Supernatural - Supernatural powers force the beginning of the end of Santana. \\"All that I am\\" is the death of \\"this once upon a time great\\"! He needs Michelle Branch and co. to sell albums. Sony is showing its defensive strategies in the wake of digital technologies. The title \\"All that I am\\" is as defensive as it can get suggesting that Carlos Santana can only make this kind of music at this age! The only decent track in this album is Trinity. All others  - I'm extremely sorry folks - dont regret spending any amount of money on this later. If you are an old santana fan, forget this one. New folks - check out the Ghost of Santana - you may want to hear the Late Santana after hearing to this.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|I just received this in the mail 20 minutes ago.....Not quite like Beth's other (excellent) releases, but perfect listening while waiting for the winter blues to break.  Missing on this cd is a lot of the electronic flourishes, but that's okay by me because she replaces it with beautifully played percussion and various stringed instruments.  Her voice is simply one of the most expressive of anyone singing today. It is very well produced, and like all of her cd's, the music, vocals, and lyrics fit together seamlessly.  While the music is different than what I have heard on past Beth Orton cd's, I'm glad that she doesn't make the same album over again.  So, bottom line, buy this now-you do not want to miss out on this beautiful collection of songs from this soulful singer.  Highly recommended!
B000002952|5.0|I'm not a fan of Gloria Estafan's pop/english music, but I was so impressed the first time I heard this when it was releasad and it still is as incredible.   <br /> <br />Not only is each song great, but they really raised the bar for production in latin music.  The sound is stellar.  I'm sure the fact that Ms. Estefan chose to work with the best musicians in the business helped. <br /> <br />Do not even think twice....buy this album and you will not be dissapointed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I first fell in love with \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" when I received the Broadway soundtrack from a friend. I wore out my tape listening to it so many times. Then I was fortunate enough to see the Broadway version, though not with the original cast, and I loved that as well. I only recently saw this movie version on HBO, and it is by far my favorite! I love the fresh interpretation brought to this version. Emmy Rossum was a perfect Christine, young, naive and vulnerable; Patrick Wilson made a great Raoul; but I was most impressed with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His performance is mesmerizing, and I loved his voice, not the same as Michael Crawford's but more deep and earthy, a great contrast to Wilson's voice. Interestingly, both my daughter, who sang portions of \\"Phantom\\" in high school chorus, and I prefer Butler's voice to any other we've heard. The cinematography is stunning, a visual feast. A wonderful movie and highly recommended.
B00005R1N3|2.0|Sure this movie preceded other horror classics like Halloween and When A Stranger Calls. Those films borrow heavily from Black Christmas but Black Christmas is a big bore snorefest.  It starts off promisingly enough, the crank phone calls are totally creepy and gave me goosebumps and I like that you're never quite sure who the killer is or even why he's killing, but like a lot of the slasher  flicks of the era, it gets really talky, slow and unbelievable in the middle. The cops are bumbling idiots, the scares are few and far between (although the eye peering through the door crack totally creeped me out) and why doesn't anyone check the attic or at least look in the window? I'm sorry, but when the killer throws a tantrum in the attic NOBODY hears him?  Come on. It's worth a watch to see a pre-Lois Lane Margot Kidder as the potty mouth, chain smoking alcoholic (although she is much better in Brian DePalma's creepy Sisters which came out a year before this) and John Saxon pretty much plays the same role he did in A Nightmare On Elm Street.  Not as good as everyone is making this out to be and it certianly could have been better.  Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of classic horror movies but I would stick to Argento for something a bit more substantial or Fulci for something a bit more gruesome.
B00005JOFO|5.0|There are many great movies. <br />There are a lot of great directors who made terrific films. There are also many great actors, wonderful screenplayers and screenplays, scores, songs and so on. And obviously there are movies - not many - with all those qualities. For me Brokeback Mountain is one of those! Plus - it is the first time that a love between two men is the main focus in a movie (just, and only just, as a fact)... Obviously doesn't matter... it's a love story! Annie Proulx had written an extraordinary heart-breaking story! Unforgettable story indeed! <br />I think the best part of the movie is when Ennis and Jack get together after the four-year without seeing each other. They - or should I say Ennis? - could not controle their emotions. It IS so moving. Ennis avoids the world outside the Mountain and he will regret it forever. Some of us mustn't stay or hide forever in our mountains I must say. <br />Like the reviewer N. Kenna I've never been so affected by a film! Without any doubt this is the best movie I have ever seen.
0440180295|4.0|Kurt Vonnuget is one of the most unique writers to emerge in the 2nd half of the 20th century. All of his novels contain a blend of sarcasm, dark humor satire, criticism of society's many hypocricies, and the exposure of human foibles/shortcomings, enhanced by greed and resource mongering. In Slaughter-House Five Vonnuget uses the perspective of a time-traveling WWII veteran, Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnuget witnessed the Dresden firebombings, as the medium to expose his view of the short-comings of human conflict. The novel is a tremendous exposure and criticism on the brutality and mind-numbing savagery of war. Even for survivors, life becomes a tale of shell-shocked incongruencies that plague the psycho-somatic foundation of a person, as illustrated in our protoganist, Billy Pilgrim. This is one of the great anti-war novels written in a completely unique format and structure.
B000002B5L|5.0|This is the album that every hip hop lover, R&B fanatic, soul seeker, and truth lover should have. This album is the ultimate definition of what music really is. It is truly at the top of my list of favorites. The tracks on this LP really hit home in the streets of the ghetto and bridged the world of reality to that of the doubtful and blind souls. It speaks to your inner being and lifts you into the beauty of hip hop at it's finest. these three artist have talent beyond what is the norm. Their diversity is soul stirring. Especially that of Ms. Lauryn Hill, the L Boogie herself (that's my baby for those who didn't know)(LOL)! They exhibit the depths of knowledge and understanding of truth and struggle: hope and happiness: good and bad. This album shouldn't sit on the shelf in any music store. I don't think there will ever be another group to set the example or the standards that The Fugees did with The Score. it's just one of those untoucable type things. Ya know? This is classic hip hop.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a deeply disturbing exploration of the psychological alienation present in a not too distant future. Written in the 1960s and using a variety of Russian and British street slang to come up with its own bombastic and puss-spewing lexicography, the prose and plot-line create a tremendous feel of the emotional distance located in the criminal mind. In addition, the outcome leaves the reader with huge quandaries and questions about the nature of human rehabilitation, forgiveness, and re-construction. In today's society with our sights set on bio-tech enhanced visual, mental, and health transformations, what will politicians, scientists, and the common public decide to do with tomorrow's criminal sub-sector? With gangs, the availability of guns, and the emotional detachment from ones fellow human beings all increasing, what ramifications, punishments, and treatments will occur in future years? This book explores this and many other heartfelt societal issues from a more simpler, technologically blase, and reclusive society. Fascinating rhythmic read from Mr. Burgess.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Who can possibly deny the feeling of exhuberation that you get listening to this album. Proving to be the driving force and by far the most talented of the Hip Hop group,The Fugees, she broke out onto the solo music scene with heart and and a strenghth so obvious that it left the competition stumbling. This album sold like lemonade in the desert. This woman is so sick with it that it's ridiculous. She's got everything that truly makes an artist an artist. Her songs on this album educate, motivate, create, debate, and elevate understanding in a way that only a master could. Not to mention that the lady's got the voice of pure beauty and unique quality. Listening to her spit a few bars is like listening to a poet that stood along side Jesus Christ! But to think that her singing skills are just as hot is almost unthinkable. Her talent is mind boggling. Check out the high note she hits at the end of the track, Zion. Is she really taking on Mariah. Man! Lauryn Hill is outrageously breaking boundaries and bridging our hearts to the world of hip hop. If you don't have this album you need to get back to your shopping cart and toss it in because one shouldn't go without. Boost your knowledge a little, free your soul, and understand that \\"Everything Is Everything.\\"
B000EHSVOG|5.0|You'll laugh at the hair-do's; you'll cry when you see the tuxedos (the best: Robert Wagner's blue !, William Holden's burgundy !!, Richard Chamberlain's brown !!!); you won't believe the 70s technology (OJ's blinking buttons computer and the kid's \\"martian ears\\" IPOD). There's even a heavy lady meant to inspire us Shelly Winter's memories in the Poseidon Adventure. <br />Still, I love this movie and, after reading about the Special Edition's features, feel no option whatsover but to buy it: <br /> <br />\\" The Towering Inferno will include audio commentary with film historian F.X. Feeney, scene-specific commentary by special effects director Mike Venzina and stunt coordinator Branko Racki, 10 behind-the-scenes featurettes (including Inside the Tower: We Remember, Innovating Tower: The SPFX of an Inferno, The Art of Towering, Irwin Allen: The Great Producer, Directing the Inferno, Putting Out Fire, Running on Fire, Still the World's Tallest Building, The Heart of Disaster: Stirling Silliphant and AMC Backstory: The Towering Inferno), more than 19 deleted/extended scenes, theatrical trailers and galleries of marketing, publicity and behind-the-scenes images \\".
B00082IJ08|1.0|Save your money and just download the only two actual songs on the whole album; Feel Good Inc. and Dare.  The rest of the album consists of tracks made up of random sounds and called songs.  This may be the worst album I've ever owned.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|In regard to many a viewer regarding the new version of King Kong as too long, I would quote Roger Ebert in saying: \\"no good movie is long enough and no bad movie is short enough\\".  <br />When I saw this film in a theater I couldn't believe during one of its best scenes (Ann & Kong by the sunset) there were people who actually took the opportunity of a slower pace in the action to buy popcorn, talk on their cell phone, etc. Most everyone nowadays likes things deliver to them fast and easy, of course they are going to find King Kong too long and it may just be pointless to try explaining them otherwise. <br />Personally, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in ages. For some reason the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy didn't completely click with me, the first thing I'm doing after watching King Kong is giving them all another shot.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|Believe it or not, Wolfmother's obvious influences are what's so great about them. Just as in 1969 when Led Zep's blues fetish was WAY obvious, Wolfmother revels in Zep and Sab, not to sound cool like say, Lenny Kravitz, but because they just dig the sound, crazy kids. God, it's great to hear aband whose ground zero goes beyond the mid 90's. One of the many tired things about Nu metal was the sense one got that these mooks never listened to any record older than Korn's second, or knew how to construct a riff without pro-tools  (yes I mean you, Linkin Park). 2006 is shaping up to be heavy with The Sword, Early Man, Witchcraft, Dungen (see them live I promise they are heavy) and this band, and lord knows it's about time. Can you picture it? A hard rock band with real guitars? a singer? no rapper? (and I'm black so no race remarks), a drummer? Yeah I barely believe it myself.  Who knows, maybe it's time to whip out the patchouli.
B000B63EZG|5.0|Don't listen to the other DIP SH*TS that reviewed this cd, it is really pretty damn good. No it is not the best album, but it sure as hell is not garbage like some say! How can some put BFMV and Atreyus name in the same sentence, Atreyu SUCKS. I hate Atreyu and I love BFMV. This CD is good, just get it!
B000065U1N|5.0|5 Stars.   <br /> <br />Now, how important is this movie in a historical sense?  I consider Blackhawk Down to be as good as: <br /> <br />1.  Glory <br />2.  Band of Brothers (a mini-series but more like a movie) <br />3.  All Quiet on the Western Front <br />4.  Tora, Tora, Tora <br />5.  Apocalypse Now <br /> <br />Yes, Blackhawk Down belongs on this list.  It's not perfectly historically accurate, what movie is?  You only have 120 - 180 minutes and a movie director does not have the time to trace every step in a book. <br /> <br />What makes Blackhawk Down a perfect movie is it shows the new American military perfectly.  In a way Blackhawk Down is like an old Indian War movie.  Basically, the Americans sort of lose.  Conversely, the way the Somali lose should break a viewer's heart. <br /> <br />The movie has a gritty feel, perfect.  The only thing you will not get is smoke drifting through your living room.  You will not smell the urine running down the street in the open sewers.  Other than that Blackhawk down is perfect in its third world feel.  Indeed, some of the advisors on the set of the movie said it was a perfect reenactment of \\"the 'mog'\\". <br /> <br />Basically this movie's facts are well known.  An American Ranger and Special forces unit trys to get a Somali warloard.  The operation turns into a disaster.  If you don't know more than that then watch the movie.  If you read the book then it's pretty much on tract. <br /> <br />I liked everything about the movie.  I liked how the Army Rangers looked perfect.  The hair cuts were perfect.  The uniforms were perfect.  Ridley Scott even had the patches put on the uniforms correctly.  All of the actors look like they came out of a year of being at Fort Benning.  I challenge anybody who has seen a war movie to ever point out more realistic looking soldiers.  Want to know another little fact?  Even the chow line is correct.  The movie felt less like a movie than you're watching events, like an invisible ghost.You are a ghost watching a combat operation.  That's how this movie feels. <br /> <br />I would go as far as having this movie as required viewing for high school and college government classes.  Why?  The men (!) shown on this movie try to fight for what is right.  The Bush/Clinton administration mission was just to make sure that the poor average Somali could have water and food.  Is that wrong to feed your fellow man?  The bottom line is the Somali's were using famine as a weapon and our government wanted to stop it. <br /> <br />This movie is a historical watermark.  It shows American military forces in limited engagements.  That's a nice way of saying a few guys are sent in to get a dirty job done.  The trouble with that basic thesis is they can get killed on the job. <br /> <br />Apocalypse Now, for all its problems, did kind of correctly show the typical American what Vietnam was like.  All Quiet on the Western Front shows the horrors of World War One's trench fighting.  Tora, Tora, Tora gives a gripping story of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Glory shows an African-American unit in the Civil War.  Last, Band-of-Brothers shows a great para-trooper unit fighting Nazi-German.  All of those movies are more than five stars.  They are the greats. <br /> <br />Blackhawk Down is a great movie.  Fifty years from now historians will be using this movie as an example of the limited wars America fought in the early 21st century. <br /> <br />5 Stars (deserves 10 ) <br /> <br />Yes, I own a copy and am proud of it.  Hoo-wahh Rangers!
B000E0WJIC|5.0|This cd is like taking a little Trivium, Killswitch Engage, and 36 Crazyfists and swirling it all together and out comes \\"THE POISON\\". (Yes it is that good) Why aren't these guys household names? They are hands down better than the majority of the garbage \\"metal-core\\" bands out there. Songs such as \\"Suffocating under words of sorrow\\" and \\"Tears don't fall\\" are prime examples of this bands ability. Matt Tuck has awesome vocals and writes some damn good tunes! The rest of the band oozes with power and dominance. Every tune on this cd is amazing and hard hitting. Watch out Trivium you now have some competetion. Get this cd and don't listen to any negative reviews you may here about this band, they are still stuck in the past! Bullet for my valetine = \m/\m/
B000028U0Y|5.0|I was not any kind of Johnny Cash fan.  I knew of him of course, and own a couple of compilation cd's that featured him, but just never became a fan, mainly because I do not considar myself a \\"country\\" fan.  Then I saw the film \\"Walk the Line\\" which exposed me to this man's music.  I realized his music was not any different than Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis' forays in to country, and very much reminded me of Dylan (of whom Cash admired apparantly).<br /><br />  After seeing the film, I decided to purchase a cd of Cash's.  I decided agains the film's soundtrack I(which I have now purchased) because I wanted to experience the artist himself.  So...Folsom Prison it was.  As a person on my way to be coming an ordained priest, one of the traits I learned about pastoral care is that one needs to be present to folks where they are...and Cash's ministry to prisoners where they are was a hugely important one, and one that I admired.  This cd is a joy, because a non-judgemental Cash performs songs, that at times celebrate crime, and others what prisoners might miss (dogs, mother, etc.), but this is real...he entertains people where they are...non-judging, but ministering through music.<br /><br />  That being said, even without my thoughts on religion, this is a wonderful cd, which brings a true \\"live\\" feeling to the listner.
B000BKJ78U|4.0|I, for one, am tired of hearing the incessent complaining about the \\"flawed\\" version of the trilogy being available on DVD. The changes made to the movies are, at very worst, minimal and not that noticeable. If you are reading that much into a single blaster shot from Greedo, than I am not sure how you enjoy movies at all. The plots are still the same, the characters are almost identical, its still the same movie, chill out about it already. <br /> <br />As for this boxed set, I had been waiting for a price drop on the '04 boxed set before purchasing, and I picked this one up after Christmas. I like the box art better, and honestly, I never watch DVD extras. If your just looking to pick up the movies, than this is a great boxed set at a reasonable price for 3 classics.
0380725398|5.0|I went to the public library once to get an english book. wen I asked the librarien if she could recommend me a book she immediatly said jamaica Inn. And she just kept on talking about how great the book is. <br /> <br />Well now i have read it myself and i really can say that the librarien was right. It is a beautiful story about a girl who lost her parents and goes to live with her aunt and her husband.  <br />she discovers the criminal activities of her uncle and tries to stop him. <br /> <br />I am from holland so i am used to other kind of books. But i have to say that jamaica inn has opened my eye for english literature. <br />the story is beatiful and what i liked most is the struggle of mary during the book because her parents died and she has to do it all by herself. <br />An other great thing about the book is that things happen that i did not expect like the fact that Francis Davey turns out to be the leader of the gang. <br />I found it great reading this book.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This is movie is based on a true story, and centers around Rocky Dennis, a 16 year old boy who was born with severe facial deformities. Since he was a child, doctors had been telling his mother, Rusty (Cher), that Rocky would never make it through the next year of his life. However, 16 years later, he was still proving them wrong.  <br /> <br />Rocky's mother is very protective and very devoted to him, even though her personal life isn't stable. Rusty runs with a wild bunch, and parties every night, and usually spends the night with a different man. Plus, she is a drug user. This in itself is a source of tension between she and Rocky. Yet they still love one another very much and would do anything for the other. In fact, Rusty has helped Rocky immensely when he gets one of his terrible headaches, which are a result of his deformity. Rather than resorting to medicine to cure the pain, Rusty manages to literally talk Rocky through it. <br /> <br />Gar(Sam Elliott), an old flame of Rusty's, returns to the picture, and after time, they resume their old relationship. Gar has been like a father to Rocky over the years, and is basically the only good guy that has been in Rusty and Rocky's life.  <br /> <br />The movie follows the ups and downs of their life together, as Rusty continues to battle her addictions and Rocky enters the 9th grade. He is in a new school, and has to deal with the taunts of his new set of classmates. To make things harder, he develops a crush on a girl, knowing that she will never return his feelings because of how he looks.  <br /> <br />Despite the adversity, Rocky is the smartest kid in his classes and ends up making friends by tutoring one of the popular boys. After that, he is accepted a little bit more, and ends up befriending a few others. <br /> <br />In this version, there is a new soundtrack, using Bruce Springsteen's songs, the way it was supposed to have been released all those years ago. There is also a new scene with Rusty and Rocky,where they are hanging out with Rusty's friends at a bonfire and Rusty and Rocky sing a rendition of 'Little Egypt'. This scene is true to life, and is something the real Rusty and Rocky used to do. <br /> <br />Another added scene is after Red, one of the oldest in the gang, dies. They have a genuine bikers funeral for him, where his motorcycle is buried alongside of him, and they fire off handguns in salute. <br /> <br />Eric Stoltz is great as Rocky. I am not really a fan of Eric's but in this movie he delivers. Cher is great also, and is perfect in her portrayal of a troubled mother battling her addictions and inner demons. It's probably my favorite role of hers. Sam Elliott exudes sex appeal as Gar, and you can see why Rusty was so hung up on him.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on about this movie, but then I'd end up relaying the whole thing. Suffice it to say, this is a really wonderful, sad movie. If you haven't seen it, you need to.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This film recounts the final days in the life of Brandon Teena born Teena Brandon, a young woman posing as a man to live the life she knew she should.  The fact that this is a true story resonates deep and makes watching this film all that much more gripping and then heart breaking as it spirals towards its brutal final frames.  Brandon (Swank in a riviting performance) moves to Nebrasca to start her life over, getting involved with all the wrong crowd and falling in love with the wrong girl (Chloe Sevigny who just does brilliantly here), a girl once involved with the town bad@$$ played by Peter Sarsgaard in yet another Oscar snubbed performance.  Brandon befriends all of these people, even residing with some of them, until her secret is revieled and her life is tragically changed.  The acting in this film carries it to the next level by making you feel emotions you would never feel otherwise.  It's heartwrenching as you expirience life through this womans eyes and see what she sees, feel what she feels and watch as her life comes smashing down on her.  I think we take our lives for granted when we live simple excepted lives, lives that never get a frown or a dirty look or a comment behind our back, or in the case of Brandon Teena, a bullet in the chest.  We just go on living and never give it a second thought.  I feel that whether you agree with the live choices that Brandon/Teena made her story will still resonate deep because she did what she believed she should and was judged unjustly for that.  She never deserved what she got and yet she didn't have a say in the matter.  I cried like a baby at the end of this tragic film, as I think anyone with a heart will.
1581806574|4.0|This is a very nice book for advanced artists.  It is helpful in understanding different types of dragons and mythical creatures.  It describes different body, head, and wing types.  I would recommend this book for anyone who has a lot of interest in fantasy drawing.
B00006879E|4.0|Honestly, judging from what was playing on the radio (i.e. \\"She Will Be Loved\\") I figured I wouldn't really enjoy Maroon 5. However, it seems that the song may have merely been used to draw attention to themselves. Many of the others on the album are drastically different, and manage to draw many an emotion.  <br />To a music intellect, highly reccomended.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, it had an awesome cast, all of whom i enjoyed in all their other respective films, and yet, this movie was horrible. The acting was good, i give them that, but it had absolutley no direction. It took far to many tangents, and did not bother to explain anything. In addition character development was not gradual but went from one extreme to the next in almost a scene. I would say that it relied to heavily on brothers grimm stories, but i cant honestly say. Ultimatly this film was seriously lacking in direction, and the plot was weak at best. I would strongly suggest looking for something other than this film
B00000JQFM|5.0|Read an earlier review that mentions how Satch paints with his guitar.  It's not just simple music; his work at this stage was a portfolio of his artwork.  He doesn't need lyrics to tell his stories, his music speaks for him.  My favorites of his always incorporate his blinding speed on the guitar; but most of all he has no limits to his creativity as an artist.  He paints a different picture every time, from totally kick-ass to totally haunting to gently romantic, with everything in between.
B0002OERI0|4.0|hey. geez what is with you people??? wow i cant believe it. clique-ing a purposely non- cliquey genre of music. punk, rock, punk-rock, ska.. all of these genres were created especially not to be judged. there is spposed to be no criteria for these genres they are supposed to be whatever the artist wants. thats the whole point of it.. anti-pop expression (pop in pop music means popular, accepted by society freely, and sung by someone who didnt write or play the music and it is stupid music), controversial good music. There is no such thing as a punk band not being \\"punk enough\\" get over yourself u snobs u have no idea what good music is. BUY THIS IT IS GOOD.
B00001QGPS|5.0|To say that Redman and Method Man know what they're doing is an understatment...with club hits mixing pumping, brain pulsing beats and rhymes that out rhyme even the best in the biz, this album sports quality tracks with an overall quality good time.  Recomended, highly, to any fan of hip-hop.  Method Man is the man, and with Red at his side he's unstoppable.  TICAL!
B000002IP1|4.0|I always thought But Seriously was a great effort for Phil, even though most of it is very slow, there are some great Pick me up songs on here, with a ton of really good musical guest. Even though Phil was starting to lose a little bit of his zest in this era, its still very well done, and it would be the last Great album that Phil would do solo.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Maggie Gyllenhaal won my heart with her portrayal of Lee, a quirky young woman who's family life has pushed her to self-mutilation (an act that landed her in a mental institution).  Upon returning home from her stay in the ward she is determined to live her life a new by starting over, getting a job and being normal (although, how can you be normal when you have a mother who waits outside your place of work all day until you get off just so she doesn't have to go home)...So Lee starts working for the anal retentive if somewhat sexist lawyer Edward.  She is his new secretary.  Yet she makes mistakes, and Edward is a bit of a perfectionest.  So it's only natural that Lee will have to make up for those mistakes.  Quite a few spankings later, a few rug burned knees (from crawling people) and a pretty obvious cum stain on the back of her blouse and things are starting to get serious...but it's how serious that will surprise you.  The ending is not anything I expected, mostly because it had a layer of warmth and warmth was not anything I expected from these charactors.  Watch this film, if not for the humor that is found in exploiting sexually debased activitys or the idea that two people repressing so much can let it out by spanking one another, watch it for Maggie's brilliant performance, not to mention Spader pulling off what he does best.  Great film for the freak (meant in a good way) at heart.
B000001F5F|4.0|This is the U2 that I used to like and even though times change, and bands get older and start experimenting with different material, it doesnt mean they have to write some soft, whimpering album made for Lite-FM radio, like \\"How to dismantle an Atomic Band\\" Yet, This is one hellva Live album, and it also contains all of U2's best songs from their early era, (expect for one, that why it didnt get 5 stars) There is so much energy in this record, and the songs live, are actually  better then the studio versions. If you arent a huge fan of U2, I believe you will like this anyway because it is one of the better Live Rock records. Though short, its sweet, and shouldnt be missed. ENJOY
0142000663|4.0|This novel is a classic and I am glad I finally read it.  The images Steinbeck portrays are vivid and the story heart wrenching.  I am sure this is a fairly acurate portrayal of the life and times of the \\"Oakies\\" and other families like them.  Having said all of this, I found it depressing.  I was waiting for one good thing to happen to the Joads, but was disappointed.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I have never gotten over the fact that Rage against the Machine lost Zack, because I believed that their final original release \\"The Battle Of Los Angeles\\" was the finest album, and I am sure that the next would have been just as good. If we look at the other side of the coin, it was just as disappointing that Chris Cornell left Soundgarden, espically when he made a pretty bad solo album. So what do we get Now, we mix Rage against the Machine (- Zak) and add Chris, and we get Audioslave. The big question here is does it fit? Kinda of...I mean, I still believe that the band was suited for a vocalist more of Zak's style, yet Rage was a bunch of great musicans, and Tom Morell is probely one of the most under-rated guitarist. Chris as we know, can sign, but his vocal style doesnt seem to fit in all of the time. I figured that with Cornell writing all the lyrics there were going to be some slow songs. Rage never wrote one ballad in thier life, and even though the band says Audioslave, its still Rage w/o Zack. I would have bagged the whole idea of playing ballad type material, and those songs just dont seem to fit with the band. Yet there are some great Hard Rock songs on here, with some great Solo's from Tom. SO to answear the question once again, does it fit. Yes, it does, but..not on the slower material. If just sounds wrong. Dont expect to hear full out B**ls to the Wall Hard Rock on this, like on all the other Rage albums. This one is a bit watered down.
B0006L16N8|5.0|<br />I didn't think X&Y could match the hype, but it exceeded it in my book. A sensational effort from start to finish--a worthy follow-up to A Rush of Blood to the Head. <br /> <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is one of the last great rappers that we have from the great early 1990's period of hip-hop, and this earlier work of Nas is as always, good hip-hop. Even if the rest of the songs sucked, which they dont, the album is worth its weight in gold with \\"The World is yours\\" which I think might be one of the best rap songs of the 1990's..ENJOY this, and support Nas for not selling out. In fact if he was smart, he would forget his beef with Jay-Z and start teaming up with him, since Jay is another talented hip-hop artist. Maybe the both of them can go out and find some New talent, and start blowing up on Dre's garbage heap of sh#teaters such as 50, The game (who isn't with the G-Unit posse anymore, but give him time, he will be back,) and D-12, not to mention the horridness of the newer Enimen material. These posers seem to be dominating the hip-hop market, and are draggin it down with Bubble Gum lyrics and cheezy ass tales from the hood that I dont believe for one second. Get Naz and Jay together and create some really good hip-hop projects.
6300216748|5.0|Robert Redford does a fine job in his portrayal of unsuspecting CIA research analyst Joe Turner, code named Condor in the suspenseful espionage thriller directed by Sydney Pollack \\"Three Days of the Condor\\".  Redford goes out for lunch for his fellow researchers in the Manhattan CIA station and returns to find them all assassinated.  The hit team is coordinated by contract assassin Joubert played by a cooly professional Max Von Sydow.<br /><br />This begins Redford's paranoic flight to come to grips with what has happened.  He kidnaps the innocent Kathy Hale, a photographer played by Faye Dunaway, who he recruits to shelter him in her place while he figures out his next move.  A meeting arranged with his station chief arranged by deputy CIA director Higgins played by Cliff Robertson results on an attempt on Redford's life.  All the while he's being stalked by Von Sydow and his team of killers.<br /><br />He realizes that there is a clandestine branch of the CIA running an operation which a speculative report filed by Redford had unwittingly revealed.  The game of cat and mouse continues until Redford gets answers finally from Robertson.  He however has no assurances that his life will be free of danger even after he reveals the mechanisms of the illicit operation to the press.<br /><br />Sydney Pollack does an excellent job in representing the secretive tenor of government operations during a sensitive era in U.S. history replete with orchestrated coverups like Watergate.  Using both New York and Washington as an effective backdrop he utilizes both locales to help fuel the complexities of the various twists in plot that add to the tension of the film.

B00001W9G0|5.0|Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardner are students at Cornell.  And there their similarities end.  Hubbell was a golden boy to which everything came easy and he always took the easy road.  Katie had to work at everything and therefore, she took the hard road looking for every cause to fight for.  Katie and Hubbell had one class together creative writing.  Katie wanted to be a journalist and she prized this class but is devastated when it's Hubbell's story that the professor praises.  What is worse is the story is good. <br /> <br />Both graduate and go their separate ways.  Katie becomes a writer for a radio show and Hubbell enlists in the Navy.  One night Katie is at a nightclub with her boss and who is there (asleep on a barstool), Hubbell.  Katie takes him home and thus begins their relationship.  But as they had different backgrounds neither is quite sure what that relationship is.  Despite their differences they get married. Hubbell's book is optioned by a studio and they are off to Hollywood.  <br /> <br />Everything is going fine.  They know what lines not to cross and stay away from them.  That is until communism hearing become a little too real.  Katie comes to the rally of the Hollywood victims of the hearing but Hubbell wants to stay clear.  This starts the end of their marriage.  They know that they love each other but cannot be with each other and end it amicably. <br /> <br />Years later they meet.  Both have remarried but their reunion tells you that each is the other's true love. <br /> <br />This is considered to be one of the great romances of all time.  I definitely agree with this!  Streisand is the perfect choice for Katie (the character in the book was inspired by her) and Redford is the perfect choice for Hubbell.  They exuded a chemistry that neither has equaled in future films.   <br /> <br />This film is well made from every aspect.  The cinematography adds feeling to the scenes.  The art direction and costumes evoke the erasinvolved.  And Marvin Hamlisch's Oscar winning score is perfection. <br /> <br />If you ever had someone that you loved but lost, this is the perfect film.  Plus according to every TV show.  This is the movie you must watch after a breakup! <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS:  Making of Documentary - Looking Back: A one hour documentary on the making of the film with Streisand, writer Arthur Laurents, director Sydney Pollack <br />
B000BKVQTS|5.0|What I was afraid was going to be an \\"18th Century Ghostbusters\\" wound up very different and very wonderful in the hands of Terry Gilliam, that ex-American absolute master of cinema.  He even got a decent performance out of Matt Damon, which I didn't believe possible. <br /> <br />If you've followed Gilliam's career, you won't be disappointed by this one.  It's not his best film (I'd let Fisher King and 12 Monkeys kick each other's arses for that distinction,) but it's as great as Munchausen, Time Bandits or Fear and Loathing. <br /> <br />If only more people understood Gilliam's films...then maybe some distributor would actually pick up Tideland and exhibit it.  Tideland is complete, but rotting in the vault at the time I write this...
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt was one of three or four CD's that never left my car or my walkman when I was in high school.  Every song on the album, except for \\"Rooster\\", which I know I'll probably take a lot of crap for for fans of the song, is awesome.  Such gloom and doom in an era in which was filled with the same.  Staley was in his prime, drug filled world in which he gave us all visual images of rain, holes, bones, and angry chairs.  A masterpiece and a must have for any true lover of the band.
0451191153|4.0|In terming Howard Roark the ideal man, Ayn Rand signified that he is meant to be taken literally.  In this regard, the book is something of a failure; Roark seems somewhat empty, full of integrity and wisdom but lacking in those human qualities of laughter and love.  This is remedied somewhat in the second half of the book, as he settles into joyful relationships and begins to defrost a bit, but for the majority of the novel he is distant and unrealistic. <br /> <br />However, if the reader steps back and takes Roark, as well as the other characters, as microcosms of various personality types that can be applied to a spectrum, he or she will spot no end of truth in The Fountainhead, which is basically a platform from which Rand can explain and justify her own philosophy, Objectivism (\\"rational selfishness\\").  Rand rails against any number of societal norms or ideals here, including altruism, collectivism, selling out, and the celebration of mediocrity (I often wonder what Rand would say if she were alive today, an age when stupidity is openly praised). <br /> <br />Like any philosophy, objectivism can be dangerous if misinterpreted; it's easy to believe Rand is justifying self-preservation at the expense of others.  This is hardly the case; while Rand does advocate success and the amassment of wealth and material goods, she never sponsors greed.  I suspect this is why Roark spends a significant portion of the novel in poverty. <br /> <br />Apart from the philosophical edge, the novel is enjoyable because Rand is just a damn good writer.  Her imagery is poetic in a way that most poems can't match.  Her characters are multi-faceted, psychologically complex creatures that have believable motivations for every action.  The plot is logical, if not entirely realistic. <br /> <br />The main flaw of the book takes place at Roark's trial in the last chapter or so.  Rand apparently thinks the reader has been sleeping for the past 700 pages, so she bombards him with an extremely long speech that pretty much condenses the entire novel into ten or twenty pages.  Since the information is nothing more than new phrasing for old ideas, the speech is redundant and becomes tedious fairly quickly (though I imagine it's a goldmine for students trying to cite the novel in a thesis).  There are other minor flaws, mainly little details Rand doesn't address--like how to create a harmony with the environment after pillaging it to remold society to man's desires--but this book is by no means the end-all be-all of philosophic thought; that being the case, I urge you to read other contrary viewpoints that will help you form a synthesis from which to cultivate your own beliefs.   <br /> <br />But be sure to read this book, whatever else you do.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I began watching this show w/ my wife (it started off as a compromise while juggling between 1 T.V.), and after a couple of episodes became hooked. My wife loves the show and so do I, and with her finishing up nursing school, it gives you a great vicarious look at the careers of doctors and nurses. <br /> <br />Watching these characters go from spontaneous adolescents, to mature doctors in the field, is quit interesting to watch unfold week after week. The DVD is a must have for any fan of the show, but I must warn you, you'll be up for hours watching the episodes chronologically; it's that addictive. Something sublimely makes you go out and purchase the soundtrack also. The DVD and the soundtrack as a valentine gift, provided for a very romantic evening. If you're trying to find a great make-up gift for wife, look no further than \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" season one DVD.

B000000H3Z|5.0|This is Insane.<br /><br />Sepultura rock the halls of metal. This album is heavy duty man. Its one heavy ass rumbling mass of pure metal awesomeness. It just doesnt get any better then Sepultura in the loud genre or metal. New metal should bands should praise this album and the brazilian boys Sepultura, because they know how to really rock the house out with their loud insane guitar riffs and extreme vocals. Beneath the Remains destroys any of those whiny new metal bands clear out of this world. If you want true metal mania, Sepultura is there for you. They dont add cheap sound effects and synths and whiny vocals with rap singers, they dont soften up unless is beautiful tribal songs youd find on Roots. This album is truly a landmark in metal. It never stops kickin' out its awesome, heavy duty, thunderous, earth shattering, quake creating riffs. This album is loud and metal. True 100% metal. Sepultura makes the awesome genre of metal look very good and shine brighter then just about every metal band ever made. If you want great metal, you want Sepultura, and if you want to start with a phenominal album, start with Beneath the Remains.
1400031087|1.0|Call me na've, but I didn't know the book was fiction when I read it. Overall, I enjoyed the story--it was a compelling tale of Mr. Frey's struggles with addiction, deep-seated hatred of self and family, bitter resentment, and the ensuing depression that fueled a prodigious intake of drugs before he achieved sobriety \\"his way\\". Most of the reason it was so riveting was because someone actually lived through it, given the need to suspend disbelief for some of the more implausible episodes.<br /><br />My enthusiasm for the book has waned quite a bit now that the author has admitted that the book was an \\"embellished\\" account of \\"...memories of [his] time in a drug and alcohol treatment center.\\" I thought that memoirs were accounts of personal experiences of authors, meaning that they were recollections of past events that represented, as faithfully as possible, what actually occurred.<br /><br />Everyone knows the canard about 15 witnesses to an accident having 15 versions of events. People remember what is important to them, or what they can (in the case of addicts) remember, and The Truth is among the collective recollections of the parties involved.<br /><br />It seems to me, however, that the author refuses to acknowledge his outright dishonesty by saying that's the way he remembers it, only *embellished*, and that it's not important how the publisher categorized the book.<br /><br />I think one could drive a mack truck through the gap between Mr. Frey's \\"memories\\" and past events as recollected by others. To parlay a few hours of detention in a quiet, wood-panelled room in a Podunk police station into a 90+ day stay in a maximum security prison is not, no matter how much Mr. Frey would like to dissemble, an honest portrayal that belongs in a memoir--and I seriously doubt he could have maintained a blackout for that long. To appropriate the details of a tragic death of a passing acquaintance for his use to win readers' sympathy is downright despicable.<br /><br />The danger in continuing to believe that any part of this story is true is that of the alcoholics in the 83% of those who relapse in their struggle with addiction, how many think it is a good idea to follow Mr. Frey's example and walk into a bar and put their face to a glass of alcohol because he supposedly did it and was able to walk away? Addicts need truth in their lives, not more lies. In fact, we all do.t any part of this story is true is that of the alcoholics in the 83% of those who relapse in their struggle with addiction, how many think it is a good idea to follow Mr. Frey's example and walk into a bar and put their face to a glass of alcohol because he supposedly did it and was able to walk away?

B00005JO20|3.0|What a lovely 90 minute film that lies within these 187 minutes......  To me the 2005 film only works when it sticks close to the original of 1933. The cast is great though, but sadly Kong is just one of many monsters on the island and the most exciting scene is the escape from frightened dinosaurs....  The excape from the insects were cut in 1933 because it took attention from Kong. Why didn`t they learn???<br /><br />In 1976 Kong is a great beast with almost human qualities - sort of a missing link. Here he is back being a gorilla of oversize and it is a puzzle why Ann is not killed by his rough treatment of her early on. The Jimmy-Hayes relationship goes nowhere and they could easily have been omitted.<br /><br />The 1976 film has great locations, while this is a blue-screen effort and u see it much too often. I mean several cliffs and stones in the shape of a gorilla?  It's  enough with Skull island... Ann`s vaudeville tricks and their Bambi-moment in New York is BAAAAAAAAAAD...  The New York sequences should have been better, but the Empire State Buidling-scene survives...<br /><br />The sacrifising of Ann is both good in 33 and 76, here - it's dramatic, but the first sight of Kong is just shadow.......And magical moments are far between because Jackson doesn`t dare to slow down...<br /><br />In the 1976 film we get to love Kong....  Here... well we don`t....  It`s a great actioner, but I wish Jackson could have relaxed a bit.... It's funny the way Denham refers to Fay Wray early on(\\"but she`s shooting over at RKO\\")<br /><br />Many people feel Kong is a racist. But that`s insane... Of course he warms up to a whiteperson - she`s a novelty - a new thing to him..... He is just curious and collects her as a prized possession.<br /><br />But it is an OK contribution to the myth of Kong. It's NOT the best Kong, but it's OK in a trilogy of the giant....
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I have seen all the earlier Batman movies and I must say this is by far the greatest. The older ones were ok, but lacked that realistic feel. In Batman Begins I felt moved by it, it was realistic, it was dramatic, and it felt real. This movie is a must buy for any action/adventure lover.
0800179501|5.0|As a child of the 80's and a martial artist, this movie rings true to me on more than one level. Some people may grade this movie low because of the feel good tone of the movie, but that was the tone of the 80's - everything seemed to have so much promise.    This is a film with very few flaws. The acting is top notch, from the main characters of Daniel and Miyagi, to supporting roles of Mrs. LaRussa and John Kreese, there isn't a weak charcter in the cast and all are acted superbly. The plot is farely simple, yet one that many people can identify with - Single mom moves away with son away for a job, son gets picked on, finds and friend and mentor in the apartment handyman, who happens to be an Okinawan Karate master.    Where the film really succeeds is in the portrayal the martial arts spirit. I had a discussion with someone who insited the movie was flawed because Johnny would have beaten Daniel in real life. All I said to him was the movie was more about the spirit of Karate, not who would beat who. Daniel learns not only how to defend himself against those who would do him harm, but earns their respect as well. As the trilogy goes on, each film focuses on a different aspect of the martial spirit, whether it be respect, honor, or training for war to attain peace. These are the true messages of the Karate Kid, and this is why I guess some people don't get it.    As a final note, I was deeply saddened by the recent passing of Pat Morita. Even though he didn't know a lick of karate, his portrayal of the Karate Master did more for martial arts than any other film role could. Those of us who saw this film in the theatre were always searching for our Mr. Miyagi, to teach us not only karate, but life. Some of us were lucky enough to find him....

0440241588|1.0|Grisham has three Pakistani 'computer scientists' connect a satellite phone to three (wow!) computers, and they use this 'system' to discover and listen-in to top secret satellites, some of which are 'hovering ...300 kilometers above', and others that are 'moving north-northeast at 120 km per hour'. What silly ignorance of technology! This completely put me off this book. <br /> <br />Satellite phones cannot be used to locate anything! They can communicate with satellites, but their not designed to 'measure' a damn thing about them! <br /> <br />No satellite can 'hover' 300 kilometers above earth! It would have to be moving at about 18,000 km per hour to stay in orbit! Communication satellites 'hover', but they are about 25,000 miles up, in synchronous orbits! <br /> <br />US spy satellites would communicate only using super-encryption; these 'computer scientists' could link up 10,000 PCs, and if they worked for 100 years they couldn't eavesdrop on a single message! <br /> <br />How can Grisham be so ignorant?! How can his technical editors be so ignorant? Or do they just assume that every possible reader is a technical illiterate, completely ignorant of such 'technology'?? It makes one wonder about Grisham's understanding of other subjects, including the law. <br /> <br />When an author puts out such drivel it has only one place: in your garbage pail, wrapped like a rotten fish! Shame on Grisham, shame on Dell Books, and shame on all the techno-peasant literary reviewers!

B00009W0U4|1.0|Never have I seen such an urban movie. I almost vomited so many times watching this movie that I felt like I was playing some sort of drinking game in reverse. Where I expected to see time lapse footage of, say, a sprouting seedling, instead I was confronted with death and head-smashing and a devastating fire extinguisher.<br /><br />I have watched this movie 10+ times now and have not noticed a single plant, even in the background. This rejection of the natural world is tantamount to ecological murder. So this is a murder movie. One wonders where the characters in this film get their oxygen, given the dearth of photorespiration. Totally implausible and sick.<br /><br />I plan to give this movie one more try, but if I don't find some greenery this time, I will never, ever, ever watch it again.

This movie was awesome all-around not to mention epic, heroic,comic book style, and memorable. It makes me feel like a kid again. This movie went to the Fortress of Solitude, his boyhood in Smallville, his transformation to the Man of Steel, becoming a reporter for The Daily Planet meeting Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, and also facing off with villian Lex Luthor.  I can not wait for Superman Returns to come out this summer. Everyone in this movie was awesome. I also loved the soundtrack as well.

0679720200|5.0|Since Nietzsche announced the death of God, few novels have expressed the absurdity of the continuing life of faith in morality and moral responsibility as well as this compact little novel. Meursault is the ultimate enemy of society, from the opening chapter where he fails to hide the indifference he feels at the death of his mother, to the last pages where he faces execution at the hands of the judiciary, knowing that society cannot force him to play a game that he has had the courage to recognise as absurd.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is off the wall good. All the characters are close to perfectly castes. I love how the entire movie looks like comic book animation and the actors stick to comic book lines and phrases (Over dramatic, sometiems korny). The thing i look for most in a movie is whether or not you can watch it over and over again and it wont get old. There are come movies that are good or hiterical but you couldnt stand to watch it again (like napoleon dynamite. If you had to choose between renting Sin City and buying it, i would (and did) buy it becasue your gonna watch it many times and lvoe it each time.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Okay, the first time I sat down and watched NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, my reaction was the same as many: \\"What the heck was that?\\" Aside from some occasional laughs, I wasn't impressed, dismissing the film as overrated and trying too hard to be quirky. But something odd happened. As weeks passed, moments from the film started creeping into my consciousness. Sure the one-liners were memorable, but I started to remember whole scenes...and actually laughing about it. Ironically, I began remembering NAPOLEON DYNAMITE more fondly than when I originally saw it. So I decided to view it again. It was as if I were watching it with completely different eyes. The film is basically a slice-of-life story about an awkward high school kid named Napoleon Dynamite and how he deals with life's little triumphs and defeats. Practically all the major characters...Napoleon's friends Deb and Pedro, his brother Kip and his uncle Rico have their quirks but none quite as colorful as Napoleon himself (so brilliantly played by Jon Heder).But while Napoleon can be characterized as nerdy, he lives so blissfully in his own world that it's hard to feel too sorry for him. Some viewers don't like him at all. They think he's too prickly or unsympathetic. But I like him very much. Napoleon (like Deb and Pedro) is a bit of an outsider and it's possible that's because of his personality, or perhaps his personality was born out of being CONSIDERED different...a sort of defense mechanism developed over time. Or maybe, I'm just reading too much into his character.There's no mistaking the fact that Napoleon, Deb and Pedro are outsiders. During the school dance, there's a moment in which the three characters are in the foreground watching everybody else on the dance floor. At first the shot seems trivial. But after another viewing, the moment really seemed to illustrate their isolation from everyone else. I could very well have been one of them. It was oddly touching.Yet this movie is no downer. After all, the characters don't ultimately fail at all. By staying true to their originality and always being themselves, they have their victorious moments. And the more invested you are in the characters, the more pleasing their victories become. My problem when first viewing this film is that I was expecting the laughs, as you would a normal comedy. But this comedy is anything but normal. As I viewed it the 2nd and 3rd times with a different perspective, it became much more humorous, touching and satisfying. I've seen the loser-becomes-a-winner story done before but never quite like this. There's nothing apologetic or sentimental about NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, which makes it all the more charming. When the \\"Promise\\" song starts to play during that last tether-ball scene, I actually get a little choked-up. I don't know why, and it's probably best not to analyze...let's just say I love this film!I'm not going to advise people to watch the film again if they absolutely hated it the first time. But if someday out of nowhere you think of a moment from this film and it makes you smile, I say give NAPOLEON DYNAMITE another try!

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Well, I suppose I should be happy they didn't give it a rock soundtrack. This was a major disappointment. I'd been so excited when the director said he was giving the story more \\"muscle.\\" Um, not really. Apparently, in his view, Lizzie is an inarticulate, sullen, pouty anorexic. The Bennet family are hillbillies. Wow, who knew? I detest big budget phony movies, such as this. Every scene dripped with insincerity.  <br /> <br />I actually enjoyed most of the actors, even Darcy. I found it pathetic, however, that the witty, insightful words of Austen were deemed inferior to the hack screenwriter's cliches. And wow! Talk about historical inaccuracies. The country gentry of the era were cleaner than this. They may not have bathed every day...but they were neat and presentable. Clothing was handsewn and fitted with great care (sewing machines hadn't been invented yet) and they certainly fit better than the hanging, ragged smocks worn by these actors. <br /> <br />Oh, and the biggest laugh? Oh, my goodness! The last scene in the U.S. version was a direct steal from the 80's movie \\"Sixteen Candles.\\" Unbelievable!

0060837551|3.0|***possible spoiler*** <br /> <br />I watched the movie first, and was then drawn to read the book.  I don't mean to blame D.H. Lawrence, but it was his \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" that I read first before \\"the Thorn Birds\\", which makes the latter so pale and kind of superficial.  I mean the author is actually very great, and is very gifted in writing, but it just doesn't catch my heart.  I don't care about what happened in the book.  Maybe that's very weird (my fault), but my suggestion would be, never read any great authors before 'fast food' literatures.

B00004TJKI|5.0|Speaking as an attorney and film buff, my favorite law cases <br />in the movies are (in order of greatness)  (1) Witness for the Prosecution, (2) Anatomy of a Murder, and (3) The Rumpole series.   Of the three, \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is the most realistic. As the plot develops, we are never quite certain who is telling the truth, who deserves punishment, who is taking the law into his or her hands?  When a film viewer becomes frustrated by movies which depict characters simply, as good or evil, as black or white, see this outstanding production.  I consider it one of the top 100 films of all time.

B0000C8AVR|5.0|\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" alone earns 5 stars.  I remember hearing it on the radio when it first came out.  Talk about anthems!  To this day, that song gives me chills.  Who knew where we were headed in the next 5 years?!?   Chicago, Vietnam, Selma, Chicago again, Woodstock, Altamont, Watergate (alright, that one's more like 6), NIXON/AGNEW.  And through it all, you could almost hear \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" playing.  It was more than just what the lyrics were saying.    <br /> <br />I saw Dylan and the Band on tour in 72/73.   When they played that song, the completely sold out arena just plain went nuts.  A lot had happened since 1965, and that song just reminded us.  \\"How does it feel?\\"  Well, a lot had happened, but Bob and the Band were still with us.  And somehow, that made it just a little easier to stomach.   <br /> <br />I've pondered the significance of Highway 61 over the years.  I think the name of the album alone is genius.   Think of how much happened over the last 100 years within 50 miles of that road.   The birth of the blues, the Civil Rights movement, the final death-knell for Jim Crow (though some still lingers).  It's like an artery through the body of America.   <br /> <br />p.s.  I like Counting Crows, initially anyway, just on the basis that their song \\"Mr. Jones\\" is a reference to \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\".
B000002UA0|5.0|If you are a Floyd fan and have never heard this album, you are in for one hell of a trip. This is the best example of music from another dimension as it gets. This album is so crazy and off the wall that you feel like you are tripping even if you aren't under the influence of recreational drugs. If you are, it's that much better. Syd Barrett displays his greatest songwriting talents and Pink Floyd introduces the world to extreme acid rock. For those of you who want a break-down of just how great this album is, here you go: <br />(Songs rated from 1 to 10) <br /> <br />1. Astronomy Domine (10) WOW!!! What a way to start off an album with a 4:12 hazy dream-inducing composition of excellence. <br />\\"Lime and limpid green, a second scene\\" <br /> <br />2. Lucifer Sam (10) A fast-paced song that is filled with bizarre lyrics and strangly-placed surf guitar, but also one of the best songs on the album. <br />\\"Hiding around on the ground. He'll be found when you're around.\\" <br /> <br />3. Matilda Mother (9) This is where the album really starts to get strange. This song is filled with the mystique that riddles the rest of the songs. <br />\\"With silver eyes the scarlet eagle showers silver on the people.\\" <br /> <br />4. Pow R. Toc H (8) WHAT THE F**K!!! Quite possibly what would sound like the shores of the part of hell where acid-head serial killers roam. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! <br />(instrumental) <br /> <br />5. Flaming (9) Thank god, some happy sounds! What a relief after hearing Pow R. Toc H!! It's still insanely demented though. A nice little song about daydreaming (Or taking extreme doses of narcotics). <br />\\"Yippee! You can't see me but I can you.\\" <br /> <br />6. Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk (8) One of the weaker tracks. Not bad, just not all that great. The \\"Docter, Docter\\" huffing in the background gets old quick. A nice breather before the next track, though. <br />\\"Gold is lead, Jesus bled, Pain is red\\" <br /> <br />7. Interstellar Overdrive (11) HOLD ONTIGHT!!! This track grabs you and doesn't let go for nearly 10 whole minutes. This is THE ACID ROCK SONG. If you want one hell of a trippy instrumental, look no further than this one. <br />(instrumental) <br /> <br />8. The Gnome (9) A nice little story about a gnome named Grimble Grrrumble (grrr) told by a man named Syd. A nice little ditty. <br />\\"He wore a scarlet tunic, A blue green hood, It looked quite good.\\" <br /> <br />9. Chapter 24 (5) The weakest track on the album. Listen to it once then skip it from then forward. <br />\\"Thunder in the Earth, the course of heaven\\" <br /> <br />10. The Scarecrow (8) A precursor to the \\"Wizard of Oz/DSOTM\\" mystery. Why? It's about a scarecrow who didn't have a brain. Not a bad song either. <br />\\"'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind.\\" <br /> <br />11. Bike (11) Probably the best song on the album to close it out. This song really shows the insanity and madness of Syd Barrett. <br />\\"I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house. I don't know why. I call him Gerald.\\" <br /> <br />Album Rating: 10 <br /> <br />There you go. If you haven't already done so, go pick this album up as soon as possible. But, if you aren't into extreme acid-rock craziness stay away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

079073639X|5.0|\\"We all live in a spere,\\" explains the hero of the story, Joey.  \\"Within it, everything around us is captualized - leaving us trapped with all the stuff around us.\\"  These prove to be prophetic words spoken not only about the characters within this film, but about all of us. <br /> <br />This could be the perfect movie.  In what will go down in history as Barry Livinson's coup de'tet, a brilliant cast work on a brilliant film from a brilliant book to produce something that can only be described, quite simply, as brilliant. <br /> <br />In the movie, Liev Shreiber plays Joey, a young man with a passion for dance and a burning desire for his mother, played angelically by Sharon Stone.  Joey is torn between his need to shine at the local discoteque and his equivilent need to demonstrate his incestrial yearning for his beloved MILF. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Joey's dad, Jerry, played by Dustin Hoffman (who I believe was the crippled guy in Midnight Cowboy), is working hard at the factory day-in and day-out and does not understand his son's \\"queer\\" obsession with disco dancing.  In a scene torn from real-life experiences of Italian families througout the Bronx, Joey is slapped by Jerry at the dinner table as the family consumes mass quantities of Italian take-out when he refuses to accept the janitorial position at the factory secured by his father.  \\"You don't know what you're doing with your life!\\" Jerry screams at one point - and this, dear reader, is the signal of what's to come.  While the division between father and son appears to be one of misunderstanding and ill communication, it is, in fact, that the father knows exactly what's going on.  He was young once before, and without being told, the viewer may reach the conclusion that the father has dusty dancing shoes cast somewhere in the darkest reaches of his own closet pluming with the stench of his own sweaty, greasy lost dreams. <br /> <br />That night, Joey storms out of the house against his father's wishes totake part in the dance contest to end all dance contests, a disco dance to the death with the last man standing basking in the fame and glory of reality television.  He begs his mother to come watch, but she is suddenly strickened by AIDS, which she contracts from eating a bad batch of linguini.  Joey must decide:  Does he stay by his mother during her dark, final hour, or does he go participate in the contest that may produce a happy ending for his own dreams?   <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jerry has retreated to workshop in the celler to find a cure for his wife's AIDS.  Will he produce an anectdote in time to save her life before third shift starts at the factory?  Or, will he construct a time-machine and zip back to the restaurant hours earlier to destroy the linguini before anyone eats it - or will he zip further back in time to the earliest days of Italy, where he will assasinate the creator of linguini before he cooks up his original masterpiece? (I personally would have prefered to see this portion of the storyline further developed, some related scenes no doubt were left on the cutting room floor, perhaps they will be resurrected for the anniversary edition's director's cut).  It's a race against time for Jerry - and for Joey, it's a fight between his desire to bed his dying mother with AIDS and his dream of winning the disco contest. <br /> <br />The film is framed perfectly througout and the cinematography is quite simple but yet refined in it's composition.  The supporting cast is quite phenominal with Samuel Jackson playing \\"Booker,\\" Joey's main competition on the dance floor; Peter Coyote as the mysterious discoteque owner who knows more than he's letting on where it comes to Jerry's alcoholism and Mother's sudden virus; the beautiful Queen Latifah as \\"Queen Latifah,\\" Joey's love interest and dancing partner; and finally, a cameo by Huey Lewis as Napoleon Bonaparte. <br /> <br />Buy it, rent it, steal it, peer through the windows of neighbors who watch it -do whatever you must to be certain you see this film.  It just may change the direction of your life.

B000C65Z20|5.0|Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles more than does justice to John Le Carre's 2001 novel, \\"The Constant Gardner\\" in this extraordinary adaptation. He worked closely with cinematographer Cesar Charlone to recreate the vivid quality of Africa, of Kenya, and of the African people, in the movie theater. With photography, color, motion and wonderful music, the viewer is taken to both the Nairobi of the wealthy expatriate community - and the villages and shantytowns of the not so fortunate. The acting is superb!<br /><br />Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), is a kindly, self-effacing British diplomat, a bachelor attached to the British High Commission in Nairobi. He is a steadfast, loyal and moral man. Gardening is his passion. Justin meets and falls in love with social and political activist Tessa, (Rachel Weisz). One gets the feeling that he had never experienced such intensity of feeling before - not even through gardening. Therefore, shortly after their initial encounter, when she asks him to take her to Africa, he does - as Mrs. Quayle.<br /><br />True to form, in Kenya Rachel becomes extremely involved working with the poor and infirm, especially with women and children. Her constant companion and coworker is a black doctor, Arnold Bluhm, (Hubert Kounde). Together they visit villages and do the best they can to tend to their patients with minimal supplies and medication from pharmaceutical companies and relief organizations. The dates on most of the supplies and medicine are expired by the time they reach the targeted population. The donors, however, are still provided with tax write-offs.<br /><br />The film opens with the brutal murder of Rachel Quayle in an isolated area of northern Kenya, and the disappearance of Bluhm. When rumors of Rachel's infidelity surface as an explanation for her death, Arnold becomes the prime suspect as the thwarted lover. Justin's good friend and colleague, Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), tells him of his wife's demise. Justin, in shock, still feels sorry for Sandy for having to break such terrible news. Grief-stricken, Quayle begins to investigate his wife's so called \\"infidelities\\" and discovers that Rachel and Arnold had been compiling evidence about a multinational drug company that uses the poor and uneducated to test new drugs.<br /><br />Risking his own life, Quayle finds that his old colleagues in the diplomatic corps are well aware of Rachel's activities. He also discovers that life outside his garden is not a pretty place at all.<br /><br />Fiennes is wonderful as the man mourning a woman he loved but did not know very well. The depth of his quiet sadness powerfully permeates the film. Weisz is perfect as the younger woman, sincerely driven to make a difference. The scenes when she romps with the children in the shantytowns are electric with energy and joy, despite the squalid conditions. Huston's character is a real sleaze but he's not the biggest rat - that position belongs to Sir Bernard Pellegrin, (Bill Nighy), knight of the realm, and probably the most corrupt, distasteful character I have seen in quite a while.<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardner\\" is a wonderful and compelling love story, as well as a chilling mystery with themes of social justice and ethics, as well as deception, deceit and murder most foul.<br /><br />Again, Meirelles' artistic eye and the camera results are golden. The marvelous score is by Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias. Highly recommended!<br />JANASandy for having to break such terrible news.

B00000JSJC|5.0|I saw this movie on opening night back in '95 and from then on I became hooked.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie or just curious on what the `future' (2000) may hold. Then I strongly suggest viewing this movie.<br /><br />We are first introduced to a first person robbery gone, wrong, and I mean splat!<br /><br />Leo played by Ralph Fiennes was at first disappointed that the `playback' ended so badly, almost ruining his day, but hey, this is Leo, peddle a person tragic, romantic, sexual `playback' is another person fantasy.<br /><br />They really didn't get into much detail on his past but he was a cop gone bad now he's a hustler selling other people realities.<br /><br />So what is a 'sqid'?, don't worry Leo will tell all what it is. well Leo has some problems, he is really into 'playback' especially 'playbacks' with him and Faith. Yes, Leo is still in love with Faith, (Juliette Lewis) a girl he pulled off from the street, who in turned stabbed him in the back to pursuer a music career with Leo former buyer.<br /><br />Mace (Angela Bassett) is the best friend who only wants the best for Leo and can't understand why he can't let Faith go.Mace saves the day throughout the movie and she is always saving Leo rear end from a lot of sticky situations. There are some great moment when Leo realize that there is a reason for Mace preaching and once realize this act upon it.<br /><br />Max P.I. (Tom Sizemore) plays Leo friend with a few secrets of his own.<br /><br />Look out for Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order:CI) and William Fichtner (Invasion) who played police officers who gets a little trigger unhappy with the way Jericho One always had an opinion on society.<br /><br />It has everything in this movie, science fiction, honor among thieves (in a weird way), trust, happiness, and yes,you have to have love. Trust me it is a really good movie!!
B0002MG9SI|5.0|\\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is a very different movie, especially now, when most of the movies are made on aliens and natural disasters. This movie is about a girl Am&eacute;lie, who sees her life and people in it differently. She not only tries to understand it properly, but also want to help people who she thinks need it. She is serious, fun, emotional and naughty, all at the same time. This movie will leave its mark on your heart, so it makes sense to grab a DVD of it! Worth each penny.
B0000009SM|5.0|This work from Zappa is surely among his best. If you are searching for 5 records to buy from the man, be sure to put this one in the basket. Maybe with Wazoo, Waka, Hot rats, In NY and, uh, let me think whatever else ... the Helsinky Concert maybe. The line up here is truly stellar, one of the best, most cohesive band the man had in his career (and we all know that Zappa have had always tremendous bands). Each musician is really great, Chester Thompson, Ruth Underwood, Napoleon Murphy Brook, George Duke. Some of the most talented and unusual musicians that ever worked with Zappa. This is the album where you can find Sof&agrave;, Florentine Pogen, Inca Roads, Po-jama people (and other great songs but these are the greatest achievements here). Historical, legendary tunes for Zappa. Here Frank reached one of the many perfect zeniths in the fusion of styles he obtained in his career (he had many zeniths in different forms of music in my opinion). This is fusion, art rock, complex electric orchestrated music, in any case very clever and well written music. Some people call this stuff \\"Jazz-rock\\". I am always afraid of using the word \\"Jazz\\" when the music doesn't exactly swing (this doesn't, apart from a couple of short moments). Jazz doesn't have nothing to do with this music in my opinion, even in its spirit, in its scopes. The fact that this music is complex music doesn't make this Jazz in any way. Jazz is swing, addressing the chords in the improvisation, standards chord progressions, and many other things that absolutly are not in this music. I think that Jazz-rock was a definition created by some non-musicians journalists. People that cannot understand what really Jazz is about. But this consideration doesn't make OSFA a less important record, neither Zappa a less noble musician than pure Jazz players. On the contrary. It is another album from the man that is well over genres categorization. It's Zappa. And I think this is the best compliment in the world for a musician. The fact that he reached the almost impossible goal to create another musical universe (after classical, Jazz and rock!!), one completly of his own ... and he absolutly did it. He even went even well over this goal. He was Zappa my friends. No Punky Meadows! =)))) This record is really one of the most balanced, creative, well written and extravagant record in the Zappa's catalogue. Put it in your Z-basket believe me.The fact that he reached the almost impossible goal to create another musical universe (after classical, Jazz and rock!!), one completly of his own ... and he absolutly did it.

0553213105|5.0|No piece of literature explores the turbulent journey of a young courtship better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible.  Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character.  In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy.  His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride.  On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot.  The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments.  The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers?  Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness.  The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel.  Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor.  This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style.  To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement.
B000002UA2|5.0|OBSCURRED BY CLOUDS (a.k.a LA VALLE) is the first FLOYD album, that by todays standards sounds like PINK FLOYD. After the ATOM HEART MOTHER album, the band slowly started to gather the pieces together that made them a runaway success story. OBSCURRED was the first album the band released that solidified the classic lineup of WATERS, WRIGHT, GILMOURE, MASON. Here, for the first time is an album that features a handful of great tunes and not just a bunch of super bizarre acid head mumbo jumbo (not that theres anything WRONG with that.) OBSCURRED brought some important elements to the table, for instance the V3 organ, and early synthesisers started being played with. These add alot to tracks like CHILDHOODS END* and the instrumental title track. Although you will notice that this album is not as tight as say its follow ups MEDDLE or DARK SIDE, you can definately sense that these guys had found some direction (after SYD departed, the band was sort of lacking in that.) OBSCURRED contains a lot of great song writing by the whole FLOYD staff, and is full of rich sounds, to satisfy any FLOYD fan. Chock full of dark humor, and creepy images.. one might wonder what sort of movie this album was the soundtrack for. (I'm pretty sure LA VALLE is about drugs and hippies, I've never actually seen the movie, but thats what I've heard.) CHOICE CUTS include FREE FOUR, a witty, fun flowing song about death and decay, yes! WOTS THE DEAL, a folky song, with more clever lyrics and CHILDHOODS END, my personal favorite. There are a few instrumentals, but all is good. You gotta have this album eventually if you are a FLOYD fan.
B000002J03|5.0|After recording such a great first album, it would be tough to comprehend how they would even follow it up, but they did it. And my goodness they did it well. The band recorded this album while they were on the road, and you would think that it would sound rushed, but it really doesn't. This album really kicks up the heaviness a notch. Lots of the blues elements are replaced by sheer hard rock. <br /> <br />The album starts off with Whole Lotta Love, which is considered by many to be one of the first heavy metal songs. Listen to that opening riff (I think we all know it). That is heavy metal right there. It's not Slayer, but it's definitely where the ball got rolling. The Lemon Song sort of goes back to the band's blues roots, but slightly. The song is dominated by Jimmy Page's heavy and distorted riffs. Heartbreaker is another metal classic, with another recognizable riff (how do you do it Jimmy? HOW?) you'll recognize this song right away. This song alone influenced guitar virtuoso Eddie Van Halen. The song segues right into Living Loving Maid, a short and rocking song that is IMPOSSIBLE to not play air guitar to. Moby Dick is a showcase for drummer extroidanire John Bonham. Ever wonder how good Bonham is? Just listen to this song and you will know. I can't even begin to think of how he does this. When it was played live, Bonham would drum for incredibly long amounts of time, soemtimes even using his hands if he happened to break his drumsticks! <br /> <br />Ramble On has acoustic playing, but gets heavy during the chorus, when Robert Plant shouts \\"Ramble on\\" gotta love that. Some nice fantasy-oriented lyrics, it sort of hinted at the lyrics to some of their later songs, like The Battle of Evermore and No Quarter. Bring it on Home has a rather strange intro, but then Jimmy starts playing the hell out of his guitar, you'll be cranking uo that stereo in no time. What is and What Should Never Be mixes soft and heavy parts. It's awesome when the band plays slowly andthen out of nowhere, Robert starts shouting while the band begins to rock out. Thank You is a soft and beautiful song, definitely a change of pace on this album! It's a nice song to relax to and John Paul Jones plays some wonderful organ at the end. <br /> <br />To most metalheads, this is THE heavy metal album. This album was a HUGE influence on 70s metal giants such as Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult, Judas Priest, Scorpions, etc. No one was doing stuff like this in 1969, this album is so far ahead of its time, it's not even funny. And to think that it came out just months after the first album! That makes it even more amazing! After this album, the band would start heading in more challenging and artistic directions. So this is pretty much their last pure hard rock album (except Presence that was pretty heavy, but that's another review). Anyone interested in heavy metal in the slightest needs to pick up Led Zeppelin II and learn the roots of heavy music.My friends and I basically worship this album, and after you listen to it, you just might too!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Being the lover of chocolate that I am, I knew I had to see this and I'm so glad I did.  It's such a beautiful movie with a great storyline and great acting.  No wonder it was nominated for some Oscars.  It's a terrific heart-warming movie that is fun to watch again and again.  Well acted by Juliette Binoche (nominated for an Oscar for this performance) and other cast members, I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see a beautiful story with no violence, sex, guns for a change.  It's set in a beautiful country town in France and the scenery is lovely.  I love the touches of humour it has throughout and again; I really recommend this to everyone.  It also stars the amazing Judy Dench.
0679720200|5.0|First off this is directed at anyone who gave this less then 4 stars: you clearly have no intellect. From reading low-rated reviews, I can easily say that none of these people can even understand the depth of this book. It is the eternal struggle: an outsider, who is persecuted because he is different. Anyone who thought this book was bad is a complete moron, it is a deep social commentary, which those ignorant fools will never understand.
1400031087|4.0|<br />The reviews I've read on A million Little Pieces seem to fall into three categories: \\"Loved it, I don't care if he elaborated\\", \\"Loved it, but it should be listed as fiction\\", and \\"I won't read it on principle\\": Impassioned responses to be sure. Not surprisingly, either. Frey's provocative style of graphic portraiture, run-on sentences, choppy, train-of-thought ramblings, and partial conveyances captured me from the first page.  <br /> <br />I am thrilled that some ungrateful soul felt it necessary to rag on this particular author, because otherwise I never would have read it. The story moved me in unexpected ways. I felt Frey's wrenching pain during oral surgery, and still feel any elaborations merely served to reach across the paper divide and enhance my experience. Accuracy is a fluid concept and accountability lies solely with the author and his conscience (though Oprah and friends would argue that the editor/publisher shares that responsibility).  <br /> <br />Still worried about whether it should be classified as memoir or fiction? I'm not. What matters to me is that this encounter, real or imagined, now bleeds into my life, the raw edges glisten and sting, pushing my experiential boundaries. Read it. Feel it. Cry and laugh with it. Walk away changed.  <br /> <br />I am anxiously watching the mail for the \\"sequel\\" that follows Frey out of rehab and into his further relationship with heart-of-gold Leonard. I hear it is even better...if that is possible. <br />

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Amazing to see these 60-somethings up there on the stage, playing and singing like it was 1968 again. The video and audio quality of this DVD is excellent.  You have to be a diehard Cream fan to appreciate some of their more obscure stuff, which makes up the entire first disc; the classics on the 2nd disc are what make this DVD worth the money.
B00082IJ08|1.0|Whathafyuckisthissheeit? <br /> <br />I figured if I wrote it like that the kiddies who buy this won't understand. People who listen to this obviously don't understand much. I mean, honestly. If they did grasp reality, they wouldn't be listening to Gorilleez to begin with. And that would make this whole review irrelevant. But that doesn't much matter. <br /> <br />And neither does this cd. Nor you, reading this, probably. <br /> <br />Or all my negative ratings. So there you go. But what does matter? Good things matter. Character. Honesty. Being yourself. The Higher Power. <br /> <br />Gorilleez don't offer any of this worthwhile stuff. No matter how much cable TV tries to tell you otherwise. Then again, you all won't believe me. Shee!t, you probably don't even understand me.  <br /> <br />And there we go, back to the beginning. A perfect circle? No. I'd say more in the vague shape of a limp biscuit. <br /> <br />Piece out, and hope you put it together, <br />D.S.Rise
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I would have to say that this was the best investment that I had made in a VERY LONG TIME!!!! This was just amazing..from disk 1 to disk 4! The energy was super high and I would recommend this to anyone...simply amazing!
B0000CABBW|5.0|As probably anyone laying an eye on this knows, \\"Whale Rider\\" is the story of a young girl in a tribe in New Zealand who, by virtue of gender and ancient beliefs, is as much of an underdog as you'll find this side of, well, Underdog.  She would like to be the leader of the tribe, which requires that she ride whales, and that, says the tribe, is well nigh impossible.<br /><br />Pai is compelling.  Her fortitude is inspirational.  The characters around her are well-drawn, the conflict never lets up, the look into the tribal life is intriguing, and every other facet of the story is winning.  Also the cinematography is fantastic.  It's as fine a film as you'll find in the Seven Seas.<br /><br />If you don't like whales, though, you probably won't like it much.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I absolutely adored this movie, which I saw on opening night. I have always wanted to see the musical on Broadway, and still plan to as soon as possible. Therefore, I have nothing (i.e. the stage version) to compare the movie to, so I can say that, as a stand-alone movie, it was great.  I thought that the acting was heartfelt, and I loved Rosario Dawson's voice, which I found surprisingly good and unique, as well as the level of vulnerability that she brought to the character of Mimi. When Roger tells her (in \\"Light My Candle\\"), \\"You look like you're sixteen,\\" you find yourself agreeing with him. It breaks your heart that she looks--and is--so young and is living on her own in the city, addicted to heroin and infected with HIV. I agree with another reviewer--she seems as though she's trying to convince everyone that she's \\"born to be bad\\" (\\"Light My Candle\\"), but I'm just not buying it--not because of a problem with Dawson's acting, but because my take on the character is simply that she's a lost kid trying to figure out who she is.<br /><br />I thought all of the characters were endearing in their own special way, with the exception of Benny, who, another reviewer rightly pointed out, doesn't show up all that much. The songs were astounding, and I loved the way Larson made an effort to show love in all its varying forms (Angel and Collins, Mimi and Roger, Joanne and Maureen) without seeming too self-conscious of doing it.<br /><br />The only reason that I knocked the rating down to four stars is that there seem to be a lot of unresolved issues, perhaps that weren't left that way in the musical. My main beef is that the relationship (is that's what, in fact, it's supposed to be) between Mimi and Benny is a little fuzzy, and how it turns out is not explained. Since I have purchased the soundtrack and listened to \\"Goodbye, Love,\\" I feel I have a little more insight, but it doesn't seem like it is given the attention it needs. By throwing in a few lines or maybe one short scene, I think it would be a little more clear. I also had to dock it by one star because, in my opinion, the ending should have been done better. I'll try not to give anything away, but the big \\"She is...NO, she's not! Let's all rejoice and sing!!!\\" was a little disappointing. But the music is so fabulous and I became so invested in the characters that I will forgive those two flaws.<br /><br />I don't agree with the opinion that the movie came too late. As a matter of fact, at a time when new HIV infections among teenagers are on the rise, it seems like it's appearing at just the right time. And, of course, it premiered on Broadway, I believe, in 1996, so we can't forget that, either. Look how long it took Phantom to turn into a movie (which, I must say, I loved as well). It is timely and should be required viewing for teenagers. By putting faces and lives on the disease, it reaches you in a way that some people have (fortunately for them) never experienced, and I left the theater very moved.ne short scene, I think it would be a little more clear.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Tim Burton's carnival film noir atmosphere is gone and Joel Schumacher's campiness is shelved. What is left is a straightforward Batman adventure whom everyone thought would have to be director-proof.  BATMAN BEGINS is what some say is the \\"they-finally-got-it-right\\" Batman movie. Director Christopher Nolan's vision seems to be what everyone can agree on, as Batman/Bruce Wayne doesn't play second fiddle to the villain(s) in this film.  He is definitely at the forefront of the story. Christian Bale is the most intense and angry Bruce Wayne so far in the series and his Batman is even angrier. The origin of Batman is explored with greater depths and one of the key ingredients is the character of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas Wayne played by Linus Roache, who comes off as interesting a character as Bruce Wayne. The story by co-screenwriters Nolan and David S. Goyer is multi-layered and involving tying in Batman's origin with a plot of an ancient secret society to destroy Gotham City. An impressive cast in this film surrounds Christian Bale. Gary Oldman who has made a career of playing evil characters is terrific as the pre-commissioner James Gordon (he's a police lieutenant in Batman's early days).  Gordon is given more depth and character in this film than in the previous films. The other standouts are Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (playing a sort of James Bond's \\"Q\\" character) and Michael Caine as Alfred the butler.  When Alfred/Caine utters the one phrase \\"Never!\\" to Bruce Wayne's/Bale's \\"You haven't given up on me yet!\\", it is the single best line in the whole film! With the three powerhouse support characters, it is hard to remember that Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer also round out the cast. Lastly, Chicago is the backdrop for the fictionalized Gotham City and the film seems to break out from the restraints and confines of Anton Fursts set designs of the first films bringing the film more into the modern world. This is a great re-introduction of Batman to the motion picture scene and a needed boost for the Batman franchise. This reviewer hopes that the last scene with Gordon showing Batman the \\"calling card\\" of a certain villain is just the tip of the iceberg of what's in store of great things to come.to the motion picture scene and a needed boost for the Batman franchise.

B00005JM1F|4.0|If you're at all like me, Old School is one of those movies you'll crave to watch again and again. It's a hilarious story about a group of guy friends (I think they're in their late 20's or early 30's) who, following a major breakup for one of them, all join forces to create a fraternity of sorts. It's great, great fun with a hilarious Andy Dick teaching the ladies a private class (absolutely hilarious, and although I'm quite sure most people have already seen this movie, I'd hate to spoil it for the one lone freak out there who has yet to see it), the initiation of the pledges, the pledges themselves (You're my boy, Blue!), and my all-time favorite moment is Will Farrell and the dart.  <br /> <br />This movie never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun with it too.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I originally purchased this disk for 1 song but truly and surprisingly the CD is great!  I'm not a country music fan but Johnny Cash truly crosses barriers and is his own musical entity.  The song \\"Hurt\\" was used in the movie, \\"Rory O'Shea Was Here\\" and the song was so haunting and moving that I knew from the first time I watched the movie - I needed to track down this song.  A gem of a CD.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I finally found a copy of \\"Home\\" at a Wal-Mart near Birmingham, Alabama, but the US release does not included the bonus track \\"Return To Fingall.\\"  I have no idea why The Corrs, who wish to break into the American music market, continually deny the US market the bonus tracks they include on the international releases.    Anyway, virtually every song on \\"Home\\" is wonderful, but two of the songs are sung BEAUTIFULLY by Andrea in Gaelic (Buachaill On Eirne and Brid Og Ni Mhaille).  She clearly put a lot of time and practice into the songs--all of the songs she sings on the album, not just those two tracks--with the end result being worth it.    The Corrs have yet to produce a bad album.  I know a lot of people whine about their music on some albums (such as \\"In Blue\\") being more pop than Irish, but it is THEIR music and they can do whatever they want with it.  Regardless, it is nice for them to produce an album that is aimed at being Irish, and that is exactly what \\"Home\\" is and it is exactly what every Corrs fan should have in their collection.

B0006J28BO|5.0|WIth the cat returns, I wasn't sure what to expect. I certainly got a surprise, but it was a good one. <br />   When I first noted that Hiyao Miazaki was NOT the director, I have to admit, I momentarily panicked and considered not watching this. However, I did watch it and I'm glad. <br />   The story is the typical coming of age, with of course, a Ghibli flair. A young girl named Haru, is clumsy and having a hard time fitting into her own world. However, after saving a cat, which turned out to be non other than the cat prince, she is rewarded by his father with the offer of marriage into the royal family. NOt wanting this, she is told by a mysterious voice to seek out the Cat Bureau, which mostly consists of a fat, older cat named Muta, a crow, and an elegant cat statue come to life. <br />   Many times, anime lovers complain on voiceovers and I have to say I was very, Very pleased with the chose English cast. Anne Hathoway, from the Princess Diaries, was the perfect choice for the character of Haru and she played her role beautifully. Cary Elwes (spelling?) lent his wonderful voice talents to the Baron cat statuette and made a fabulous character even better. Muta, was played by (I don't know his real name) the man who is the grandfather on \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" and of course, was well paired. Finally, as a huge fan of Tim Curry, it was a delightful treat to see him star as such a hilarious and semi-evil character like the Cat king. My brother, who is a big fan of this particular actor, wasn't going to watch until he heard that Curry was staring. <br />   Some of the scenes were so beautifully animated it caught me by surprise. The deapth of the cat kingdom was also very fascianting and I loved the different kinds of cats from around the world, during the banquet. Speaking of that particular scene, i have to say, I have not laughed so hard in a VERY long time. It was so funny, I had tears running down my eyes. <br />   My only complaint would be the length ofthe film. I think it could have been developed further and only added to the granduer created. It seemed far to short and left me wanting more. In fact, I was almost disappointed after Haru's transformation from cat to human, because I thought she looked so much prettier in her feline state. Also, the duel between the cat king and the baron, could have been prolonged a bit more. I know it's a G movie, but a couple more clashes couldn't have hurt. <br />   Anyway, those few things aside, this is a delightful film experience to share with the whole family. THough it lacks some of the depth, and length, of a Miazaki film, it was beautiful non the less and a great picture for children and adults to enjoy!

B00005JOIF|2.0|The stage seems to be set for what at first glance would appear to be one of the most politically scathing awards ceremonies in years, the 78th Annual Academy Awards presentation on the ABC television network. No, this is not due in part to the announcement that the Daily Show's Jon Stewart will host the program. This is just another clear sign that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has truly lost touch with its core audience and have reverted to catering to the whims of sniveling television executives eager to lure younger adults, albeit for a few short moments, to contribute to their key demo-rating. It is instead the potential motion picture nominees themselves that will have everyone talking. There is director Ang Lee's controversial gay-cowboy picture, Brokeback Mountain, a film likely to arouse (no sexual pun intended) the pro-gay marriage advocates of California's certifiable liberal base. Here's a puzzler - how does Ang Lee go from directing The Hulk to a romantic-drama about homosexual cowboys in Wyoming? George Clooney, perennial poster boy for the Hollywood left, has two politically controversial pictures up his sleeve - the anti-Joseph McCarthy diatribe, Good Night and Good Luck, and director Stephen Gaghan's `blood for oil' leftist pamphlet piece, Syriana. If you can't recall who Stephen Gaghan is, he directed the Oscar nominated film, Traffic. Can't recall Traffic either? Don't worry, more then likely no one else can either. And what would the Academy Awards be without a tribute to the false-state of Palestine? This year the spineless Europeans honor Palestinian suicide bombers with their foreign-language contribution, Paradise Now. Yes, the same homicidal maniacs who have made the Middle East region the certifiable blood bath it is today. There is no word at this time as to whether film distributor Warner Independent Pictures has chosen to follow former-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's lead and compensate families of suicide bombers. However, it appears that the most controversial of them all is director Steven Spielberg's `semi-historical' drama, Munich, a portrayal of the events following the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Pro-Israeli advocates, not to mention the Israeli population in general, have come down hard on the Academy Award-winning director of Schindler's List, a tribute to the innocent victims of the Holocaust during World War II, going so far as to claim publicly that he is no longer a `friend of Israel'. My, how times have changed. <br /> <br />Saying the least about it, the story for Munich is perfect. Perfect that is in the sense that is nothing short of a flawless piece of revisionist history drawn from the pulpit of self-loathing Jews, Palestinian terrorists, and the liberal rhetoric of Hollywood elitists. Steven Spielberg's Munich has two fundamental flaws going against it in terms of the film's claim of historical accuracy and legitimacy. First, the George Jonas novel, Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, on which the script is primarily based upon, has been widely discredited leaving most historical and literary critics to regard its contents as a work of complete fiction. Jonas fails to support claims by Yuval Aviv that he was the inspiration for Avner and that he participated in Mossad operations to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists involved with the Munich massacre with either interviews or public statements. Ha'aretz journalist Yossi Melman revealed that Aviv, through investigative reports, \\"had a special fondness for conspiracy theories, and it turned out that he was willing to hire out his services to anyone who was willing to pay\\". The other tragic flaw of this film is playwright Tony Kushner, an openly gay and admittedly self-loathing Jew, who was brought in personally by director Steven Spielberg to rewrite the script originally penned by Eric Roth. Kushner has stated that the creation of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948 was a \\"historical, moral, political calamity\\" for the Jewish people and believes adamantly that the sole intent of the Israeli government is to \\"systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people\\". <br /> <br />Lest it be forgotten, let us make one thing perfectly clear - there never was nor will there ever be a nation called Palestine. The term `Palestine' is a modern word used to define the Middle East legion which prior to World War I was a loose association of Arab tribes which would eventually be placed under the yoke of Nazi imperialism during World War II. The British in 1917 promised the Jews the formation of their own nation, Israel, with the signing of the Balfour Declaration, a promise which was eventually upheld in 1948. There exists no Palestinian `refugee problem' today because refugees can not exist if there is no land from which they happen to be displaced from to begin with. The disdainful Arab nations which encircle the entire nation-state of Israel refuse to take in their own so that they may be used as a prominent example of the `atrocities' the Jews have committed and that Israel may forever be used as a scapegoat for their cruelty and malice. <br /> <br />Overall, Munich, albeit skillfully choreographed, suitably acted out, and brilliantly scored by long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, lacks the sufficient credibility in its anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian rhetoric driven storyline to make it a truly riveting historical drama. Munich's most glaring weakness, Kushner's screenplay, is so extreme in its revisionist interpretation of historical events it is likely to maker even pseudo-`documentarian' Michael Moore blush. Frankly the film is not all bad. Spielberg went to extraordinary lengths in the short few months of its production (filming began in July 2005, days after his two-hundred million dollar blockbuster, War of the Worlds, opened in theatres) to have nearly every scene in Munich reflect the styles, the culture, and the atmospheric feel of the 1970s. <br /> <br />First off, much to the embarrassment of Judaism in general, Spielberg and Kushner establish a level of confusion with their own twisted sense of moral relativism when it comes to the interpretation of the specific values and principles on which the Jewish religion is founded upon, an action which is hardly surprising given their fall out from their homeland. After an all too brief scene in which the Israeli athletes in Munich are taken hostage by terrorist agents of Black September, Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir is seen meeting with Israeli officials to construct a plan of retaliation against the Palestinians for the massacre. In this meeting she states, \\"Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values\\", which of course is in reference to Israel's plans to assassinate suspected members of the terrorist organization, Black September. Although Spielberg and Kushner would like it to appear as though the Jews are doing exactly that in responding to the blatant act of terrorism in Munich, this is in fact far from the truth. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an entertainment reporter for Belief.net, in his assessment of the Spielberg picture clarifies on this issue, \\"The Talmud [a record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories] clearly establishes that one who comes to murder you must first be killed themselves. Those who have devoted their lives to killing innocent people have erased the image of God from their countenances and have therefore erased their right to life\\". It is rather Christianity which advocates the concept of `turning the other cheek' against your enemies and even then it does no such thing in suggesting that total submission be taken whenever a force seeks to commit harm against you or your loved ones. <br /> <br />The false Golda Meir, a woman who in her historical context was the Margaret Thatcher of the newly founded Jewish state, offers further words of wisdom. When an Israeli official questions how this action of retaliation against the Palestinians will corrupt efforts for peace in the region, she argues, \\"forget peace for now, we have to be strong\\". Peace and strength, while distinctly different entities, are in no way incompatible with each other contrary to popular liberal mythology. Strength would hardly be an option had Al Gore been elected president when September 11th occurred, nor would there be peace. Terrorists, particularly al Qaeda, prey upon the indecisive, the timid, the weak and exploit peace deals and negotiation efforts to their utmost advantage as President Jimmy Carter can clearly vouch for. Any time in which Israel or the United States of America have flexed their muscles and stood up to those who seek to destroy our very way of life, only then have we gained the respect of the world. They may not like us for it, but we have garnered to respect. <br /> <br />In his screenplay Kushner then proceeds to scold Israel for the bombing of Palestinian `refugee camps' in Syria and Lebanon four days following the Munich massacre which killed two-hundred people. And yet he fails to mention that two years earlier Jordan slaughtered ten-thousand Palestinians with the surviving refugees fleeing to the West Bank in Israel. This act was the true inspiration for the terrorist organization behind the Munich massacre, Black September. <br /> <br />The tragic events of the Munich massacre which took place on September 5th, 1972, are never shown in their entirety together. Rather they are spread throughout the two hour and twenty minute motion picture. Most distressing and disturbing of all, the actual slaughter of the nine remaining Israeli athletes in the midst of a failed rescue attempt by German authorities is spliced with scenes of Avner having sex with his wife. The actual climax of the massacre is Avner literally climaxing. It is herethat Spielberg as a filmmaker makes his most egregious error. Rather then memorialize the unmitigated slaughter of these eleven Israeli athletes with a proper theatrical tribute he instead chooses to trivialize their deaths, shaping events to his liking so they suit his agenda. The separation of the actual massacre of the Israeli athletes from the beginning of the film drives home Spielberg's point that `violence begets violence, blood begets blood' and that the Munich massacre was merely a response to a response. Spielberg in his Judaist backpedaling fails to acknowledge what exactly the Palestinian kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes was in response to but, as with most leftist revisionist history, facts and the truth are merely an afterthought. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Spielberg in his depiction of historical events which soon followed the Munich massacre conspicuously leave out important details and significantly alter audience's perceptions of the state of Israel. This includes the Arab nations at the Munich Olympics who refused to lower their flags to half-staff in light of the tragedy, essentially endorsing Black September and the terrorist attack which took place there. And let's not forget the International Olympic Committee's refusal to construct a permanent memorial to the eleven slain Israeli athletes out of fear of `offending' those hostile to Israel. More importantly however Spielberg chooses to depict the response to the Munich massacre, in this case the assassination of eleven individuals in connection to Black September, as immediate and unrelenting when in fact it was never initialized until after October 29th, 1972, when Germany released the three surviving Black September kidnappers after a German jet carrying them was hijacked. The Germans suspiciously did this so that the three survivors would not face trial and implicate the German government, still reeling from fall out of the Holocaust during World War II, for the haphazard response. <br /> <br />Although it is Spielberg's intention to place the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team agents on the same moral footing as the Palestinian terrorists of Black September and the PLO, each group's portrayal in the film is significantly different. Only one of the three targets the Mossad agents pursue is shown committing the loathsome acts of terrorism for which they are accused. Instead they are portrayed as either kindly old men or inoperative political activists with adorable children. The Mossad agents are not given such a luxury. They are seen basking in the deaths of those they target. They scrutinize over every dollar spent in pursuit of their objectives. And one agent's tilted argument, \\"The only blood that matter to me is Jewish blood\\", in response to another agent questioning the amount of collateral damage their bombs meant for their targets may cause shows them to be fideists. They are everything short of complete and utter monsters. <br /> <br />True, Spielberg falls short of portraying the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team as total miscreations. For example, Avner and a fellow agent risk blowing their cover when they realize that a call received by the phone built with a remote detonator explosive placed in the target's apartment has been answered by the target's young daughter and alert their other team members waiting in a nearby car to abort the mission. In spite of evidence in the film to suggest that the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team avoided as much collateral damage as physically possible, risking their lives just to confirm the identity of their target via matching photos with the suspects' faces before they are killed, Spielberg in the end argues that these assassinations were all for naught. Since so few of the targets who were killed had direct links to the Munich massacre, though they were undoubtedly in some form or another associated with the PLO, the only contribution their deaths made was in the creation of more terrorists whowere even worse then the ones Mossad eliminated in the first place. This is the same demented, twisted logic the rhetorical left uses in opposing U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their suggestion that going after terrorists for the slaughter of innocent civilians will only lead to more aggressive attacks on our own soil is laughably preposterous. They would rather have our head buried in the ground with our butts high in the air just waiting for the other shoe of Islamic fascism to come down on us rather then respond to it. Let's get something straight here - killing terrorists does not create more terrorists. Did killing Nazis during World War II create more Nazis? Did arresting Klu Klux Klan members create more Klansmen? No, so why would it be any different in this situation? It is a tragically flawed logic; one sadly the radical left in this country seems intent on sticking to. In that case, let us no longer try and prevent murder, rape, underage sex, substance abuse, child molestation, or any crime whatsoever because apparently any effort we make to prevent such activities will only create more rapists, murderers, drug users, and terrorists, so it is best just to let it sort itself out. <br /> <br />This brings us to what is unquestionably the most insulting image in Munich. In the final scene of the film Avner, played by Troy's Eric Bana, meets with Ephraim, his Mossad handler, in a park and tells him he can no longer return to Israel because it is not the moral haven it once was. As the two depart, the camera slowly pans over a 1970s New York City skyline and remains transfixed for a time on the haunting image of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. It does not take a genius to figure out what Spielberg and Kushner mean to suggest here. September 11th is our Munich. A response to a response - nothing more. They mean to suggest that the tragic deaths of both the eleven Israeli athletes in Munich and the nearly three thousand American citizens in NYC, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania were brought upon ourselves. Their lives should be honored, yes, but not in response against those who committed these acts of treachery. Heaven knows, why bother battling cancer if a cure has yet to be found. Better to succumb to despair and die with `dignity' then fight to the bitter end and only make a dent in it. What honor is there in that?

B000E33VWW|5.0|The competition for this year's Oscar for Best Picture of the Year is fierce. Four of the five contenders bears a partisan political message, a clear demonstration that the whiny liberal Hollywood elitists, the very same who two years ago stood as the face of their uncharismatic candidate, are not taking the second term of the Bush Administration sitting down. First we have Crash, a low-budget drama which trots out the age-old clich that America is an inherently racist society, making life a veritable Hell for anyone who is not white or Catholic in this post-September 11th environment. It serves as a certifiable guilt-trip, pressuring its audience to praise it lest they be accused of being racist. Ironically, the second Best Picture nominee, director George Clooney's `historical' drama, Good Night and Good Luck, assumes all Republicans are paranoid bigots who irrationally assume the federal government of the United States will be infiltrated by Communists. Regardless of the fact that Senator Joseph McCarthy, the partisan picture's primary target of ridicule, was right in his assumptions, Clooney's black-and-white drama stands to serve as a reflective commentary on the `resurgence' of `McCarthyism' in post-September 11th America. <br /> <br />The third candidate is Ang Lee's critically hailed romantic-drama, Brokeback Mountain, a film which has been condemned by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting as `morally offensive' for promoting homosexuality as emanating from a `deep-seated human love', while others still contend that the way in which the two leads treat each emotionally reflects poorly on the gay community. And Munich, a commentary on the continuing Israeli-Palestinian Middle East crisis, is the most surprising nominee of them all. Having been snubbed by both the BAFTA and the Golden Globes earlier this year, it is safe to assume Steven Spielberg's name may have played a vital role in the selection of this film.However, it may also have to do with the picture's message, one which some critics insists advocates a pro-Palestinian agenda. What sets Barrett Miller's directorial debut, Capote, apart as the dark-horse favorite is that it is the sole contender without a political motive. <br /> <br />The story for Capote is nothing short of sheer brilliance. Dave Futterman's vibrant screenplay, surprisingly his first, only covers a narrow period of the writer's life, specifically the five years or so he spent tirelessly constructing his non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, but this solitary event would forever change his life. It relies heavily on comprehensive dialogue rather then conventional imagery to portray the conflicting personalities of Truman Capote. As the picture's title and one-sheet befittingly suggest, the sole focus of the screenplay is on one man and one man alone, Truman Capote. From the very beginning audiences are presented with a frank, no-holds-bar encounter of the brilliant yet incessantly self-absorbed author. With the exception of a few select scenes scattered throughout the picture, there is not a moment in which Truman Capote is not front and center of the camera. Essentially Capote is Oscar-nominated performer Philip Seymour Hoffman's picture to command which he proceeds to do with startling refinement and pose. However, Hoffman's ingenuity in bringing the celebrated author back to life, this time on the silver screen, would have been an entirely fruitless effort if not for the poignantly crafted screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the biographical novel by Gerald Clarke. Hauntingly brilliant, Capote leaves audiences aghast long after the movie has ended. <br /> <br />Philip Seymour Hoffman who has amassed a prodigious amount of both critical and public acknowledgment in recent months for his performance as the accomplished and narcissistic writer, Truman Capote, is decisively deserving of recognition, giving a truly Oscar-caliber performance unlike anyother performer in recent Academy Award history. Hoffman gracefully balances the two seemingly diametric personalities of Truman Capote - the ostentatious New York City night owl who regales his fellow club-hoppers with tales of gossip and dirty humor and the assiduous journalist who twists and contorts the minds and feelings of others to achieve the result he so desires. This of course comes to a head when he interviews Perry Smith, a convicted murderer on death row who has the exact same duplicitous intentions with the writer as he does of him, for his non-fiction novel. Squaring off in a soaring battle of competing egos, this is a true highlight of the picture. Truman Capote was a devotedly pretentious individual, arguably one of the most pontifical journalists in American history. Although his novels, particularly Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood, are world renowned, he himself remains an allusive and necromantic figure to this day. It is his self-dilated ego which ultimately leads to his very downfall at the hands of drug and alcohol abuse. <br /> <br />Relative unknown actor Clifton Collins Jr. gives what can best be described as the paramount performance of his career as convicted murderer Perry Smith. In practically every way, Smith serves as a near-mirror reflection of author Truman Capote, a discovery which when confronted frightens him and leads him to a life of alcoholism and drug abuse. So much like Capote, Smith wears a distinctive mask shielding his true identity which varies depending on the situation at hand and with whom he is speaking to. From their initial encounter, Capote sees in Smith a sympathetic, artistic soul, not all that different from his own, forced unwilling into a life of crime and murder stemming from a lifetime of neglect and abuse growing up. However, we soon come to realize as we eventually do with Capote himself that this is merely an abject faade used to further his own ends. Even at the point where he details the events which led to the killing of the Clutter family, he exudes an aura of pretension deceptively portraying him as a caring soul. He heralds how he prevented his partner-in-crime Richard Hickock from raping the family's sixteen year-old daughter, Nancy, and cut down Herbert Clutter who was hanging against the wall with his hands above his head because he looked `uncomfortable'. \\"I thought that Mr. Clutter was a very nice gentleman\\", Smith relates to the author, \\"I thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat\\". The graphic depiction of murder of each of the four family members which soon follows reveals to us the true identity of the monster, apart from the manipulations and lies. <br /> <br />Regardless of who is the true focal point of Capote, it is author Harper Lee, demurely portrayed by Academy Award-nominated actress Catherine Keener, with whom audiences epitomize with the most. As we all might well have done in her shoes, Lee takes Truman's rather dampening and swaggering mannerisms with a sense of humor about her, wittingly playing off his egocentric persona. However, audiences will perceptibly notice a protracting shift in Lee's attitude toward her childhood friend as the picture goes on. As her own stock rises in the literary community with the publication of her first and only novel, To Kill a Mocking Bird, she becomes increasingly emotionally distant from him. She is less receptive of his cynical nature, candidly confronting him in their continued conversations. For example, in one of their last conversations together, Truman, immobilized in a fit of depression as he awaits the execution of convicted murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, professes to Lee that he \\"couldn't have done anything to save them\\". She in turn replies, \\"Maybe not, Truman. But the truth is, you didn't want to\\", accosting him about his self-perpetuated obsession with his book and his own celebrity and not his subject matter. <br /> <br />And Academy Award-winning actorChris Cooper gives an articulate performance, albeit a limited one, in the role of Alvin Dewey, sheriff of Holcomb, a small rural Kansas community where the four members of the Clutter family were murdered. <br /> <br />Overall, Barrett Miller's major directorial debut surpasses nearly every expectation the American movie-going public has come to expect from journalistic crime-dramas and the biopic genre in general, setting a new standard in independent motion picture filmmaking. Unlike its four other Best Picture contenders, each vying ambitiously for the golden statuette at this year's Academy Awards ceremony, Capote is the least politically charged of them all. Yes, the Barrett Miller picture does confront the issue of the death penalty, but rather then deliver a lopsided opinion it instead leaves the question of capital punishment open-ended. It should be noted however that with the graphic depiction of the violent murders any argument against the death penalty in this regard is relatively mute. Although in the case of the recent execution of `Tookie' Williams, stranger things have happened. Surprisingly Truman Capote's homosexuality, an issue the American media has specifically taken up in labeling the film a politically motivated picture, is firmly downplayed. While the movie does acknowledge his partner Jack Dunphy's confidential role in the author's life at this critical juncture in his career, a role which becomes increasingly isolated as his alcohol abuse escalates, not once does the screenplay in fact directly recognize his sexual preference. Even with no previous knowledge of the journalist's lifestyle, scenes in which Truman Capote's mannerisms are flamboyant and effeminate, like when he calls his lover from a Kansas hotel wearing a female linen bathrobe, his sexuality is rather blatant. Capote's sexuality is not nor should it be an issue in this film. And even if it were, as the partisan American media would like it to be, Truman Capote's unscrupulousjournalistic tactics are not the sort of principles and values the gay/lesbian community would likely epitomize. If anything in relation of politics, Capote reflects badly on the seemingly profiteering nature of the journalistic community and seedy tactics of the media in general. Dynamically scored, artistically choreographed, and rich dialogue, Capote is without question `the' movie to beat this year for Best Picture.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|A VERY VIOLENT horror movie!!!! Is about this girl that gets raped by four men in the woods and after that she want BLOODY REVENGE!!!!<br /><br />The story is simple but the film is very entertainig and easy to understand. There's BLOOD, suspense, nudity and GORY killings. The movie doesn't have music but it gives a more realistic touch. The direction and cinematoghraphy were VERY good for a low budget film.<br /><br />The ONLY bad thing is that the storyline is VERY SLOW! but the wating is worth if you like this kind of horror vengance.<br /><br />P.S: If you like vengance movies then you will like The Punisher, Mad Max and Lady Snowblood.<br /><br />Adios.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I went to see Walk The Line over Christmas break and everything about this movie completely exceded any expectation I had. Mr. Phoenix is a revelation, as he always is, as the tortured Cash, and Mrs. Whiterspoon could not be better as the firey June Carter. I went in knowing little of Johnny Cash's earlier music, save Ring Of Fire and I Walk The Line, however, coming out of the movie I found myself humming the tunes to Jackson, Cocaine Blues, and Folsom Prision Blues. So basically, top-notch music. <br /> <br />All in all, Walk The Line was the most emotionally engrossing experience I had at the movie theatre last year. I reecomend it to anyone and everyone.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|It is an indisputable fact that real rock has gone by the wayside. Often we hear of a band that has brought it back, only to find out they missed the mark by a long shot.<br /><br />WOLFMOTHER has hit that mark and obliterated it! The crunchy chords; the distortion; the somewhat muffled drums; the vocals out front: it has the ingredients that made their predecessors huge. If you're into that 60's and 70's hard rock sound that was coined by bands like Jo Jo Gunne, Spirit, Spooky Tooth, Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath (with Ozzy), and Pink Floyd, then you will love this album!<br /><br />\\"Wolfmother\\" is the closest thing we have to that feeling our parents got when they first put Led Zeppelin's IV or The Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers on the record player. They were blown away, just as you will be when you get to Wolfmother's \\"White Unicorn\\" or \\"Woman\\". Powerful, rockin' songs that MUST be played loud!<br /><br />\\"Apple Tree\\" has a bit (just a bit!) of rockabilly/50's pop hiding beneath those power chords -- ingenious!<br /><br />The song called \\"Joker and The Thief\\" is the only place that I can hear The White Stripes connection that some are making. If you like The White Stripes it shouldn't be a stretch to enjoy these guys as well; all without feeling like you're cheating on The White Stripes.<br /><br />\\"Witchcraft\\" has that Jethro Tull sound that has made its way into so many bands' influences. Somehow they manage to once again show their influences without making you go, \\"Oh that's so Jethro Tull.\\" Okay, maybe some can.<br /><br />If you are new to Wolfmother, then this album should be the first one you buy.  It has most of the songs that are on the singles, and much cooler artwork.<br /><br />And for crying out loud, go see them live! They are coming to America (from Australia) in 2006!
0385338082|5.0|I usually read mystery and suspense books so this was a bit of a change for me.  I listened to this book while driving and found myself laughing out loud very often.  I enjoyed it so much I could never wait to get in my car - even if it meant doing terrible errands - and I found it difficult leaving my car and probably spent countless hours sitting in my driveway.  After loving this book so much I tried two books in her Shopaholic Series, but did not find these nearly as enjoyable.  This book is a MUST read!
B000002P5W|5.0|When I was a 14 year old kid and picked this up right after its release, I didn't get it.  It wasn't as outrageous as \\"Are You Experienced?.\\"  This was my least favorite Experience Lp.  That was a long time ago.  After listening with more mature ears I find this is a great, great recording.  The compositions are much more mature than \\"Are You Experienced?\\".  This is a very poetic set of tunes that features the beautiful \\"Little Wing\\".  I can actually hear the influence of jazz great Wes Montgomery in places on this release.  And you've GOT to have \\"Spanish Castle Magic!\\"  I'm puzzled that this song has not appeared on any of the \\"Best of\\" CDs we've seen throughout the years.  It's Hendrix at his poetic and creative best!<br /><br />The sound on this remastered CD is simply fantastic.  It's every bit as good as the Rolling Stones SACD releases (the Stones ABCKO SACD remasters are incredible).  You actually get the sense that you are right there in the studio with Mitch, Noel, and Jimi.  The only downside is that with all the great new liner notes I thought I was finally going to find out who was playing that wild recorder passage at the end of \\"If 6 Was 9.\\"  No such luck.  I always wondered if that was Brian Jones who was a good friend of Jimi's.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a superb remaster!  Chas Chandler is right, this is Jimi's finest set of studio recordings (I'm not dissing Electric Ladyland as that release trascends merely recording a bunch of great songs).  Buy it!  Buy 'em both!<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me I must be on my way!
B00005JNRE|4.0|That's what Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), the widower father of seven children who'd take the team Olympic Gold for mischief-making does.  Working at a funeral parlor with two silly assistants, Mr. Jowl and Mr.Wheen (Derek Jacobi), he relies on nannies to look after his offspring, but his childrens' antics are all to drive away the nannies;  in the case of Nanny Weston, they make as if they were eating the youngest, an infant.<br /><br />Mcphee (Emma Thompson) arrives at the Brown resident one stormy night, and her profile silhouetted outside the door reminds me of the shudder one thinks when Alfred Hitchcock's profile is shown on his show.  If the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins were thrown together, one would get Nanny McPhee.  She's clearly no beauty, as she has two warts on her face, a swollen nose, and a tooth that hangs over her lower lip.  She also carries a crooked staff which she taps on the floor in order to conjure magic.<br /><br />She wastes no time in getting the kids well-behaved, especially in a scene where the children have invaded the kitchen in defiance of their father punishing them.  Her way is akin to forcing a PS2 junkie to keep playing games until he either gets bleeding controller blisters or his eyes pop out of his skull.  Result, he'll have had enough.<br /><br />Brown is gratified that her only conditions are that she teach his rambunctious kids five lessons and that she requires Sunday afternoons off.  The lessons include saying please and thank you, going to bed on time, getting up on time, and doing what they're told.  And mysteriously, when one of the lessons are learned, her warts disappear until...<br /><br />Brown though is quite ineffectual in enforcing discipline in the household, as he is wishy-washy and too busy at his job.

B0007PAMBK|5.0|Gallons of ink have been devoted, (justifiably) to this film. But few have perhaps paid sufficient due to the cinematographer, Maurice Prather. <br /> <br />Mr. Prather aids and abets the script at every turn in his rendering of Miss Hilligoss's (in the role of Mary Henry) isolation from those around her. From his crow's nest shots of her wandering through the deserted carnival to the scenes of her lone sedan traversing the twilight prairie highway, he unfailingly delivers a picture of un-peopled vastness--a vastness that cannot be breached by human or psychic outreach. <br /> <br />And that is what this film is really about--Mary Henry's inability to accept the fact that she has already departed from the world she continues to haunt. <br /> <br />Ultimately she knows, (as does her personal Charon--the Carnival Ghoul) that she must be reclaimed--and it is in her persistent refusal to yield to his summons, from which the conflict and tension of the film springs. <br /> <br />This is perhaps revealed most disquietingly in a scene near the beginning of the film, when the minister accompanies her to take a look at the abandoned carnival--but refuses to accompany her across the barricade. Thus, though the visit is without ostensible horrific incident--it concludes with a silhouette of the Carnival Ghoul dropping his head in resignation from behind a gated doorway inside the pavilion, while at the very same moment, Miss Hilligoss, (seemingly safe in a car already miles away) is stabbed with a sudden deja vu--reflected with a rueful knowing in her eyes--one of many brilliant moments in a film brimming with them. <br /> <br />And it should not merely be to the cognoscente that such an inevitable moment as this, terrifies far more meaningfully, than any knife wielding Friday the 13th slasher might. <br /> <br />As to Mr. Prather, note how similar are the contrast and tone levels he uses to depict the vast American mid-western landscapes under over-cast skies, to that used bySven Nykvist in Bergman's \\"Winter Light.\\" Though the Bergman film is set in Sweden--surely the similarity is not coincidental.  <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />

I'm not sure what has happened to the Wu for like the last 6,7,8 years or so, but I'm still jammin' Tical, Liquid Swordz, Gravediggaz first, ODB's first, Chef's first, and 36 Chambers every once in a bit.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well worth every dime you pay for it. The series is essentially a blend between classic elements of Westerns and good space-traveling sci-fi, all with great human elements thrown into the story. Honestly, if you're a sci-fi fan, or simply a fan of a good story (complete with good laughs) pick this set up.
0141439661|5.0|Great book! I saw the film before I read the book, but the book didn't let me down one bit. I love how Jane Austin describes the band between the sisters, and how she talks about how they are in love. The chosen words are beautiful too, but you vocabulary has to be in order to understand this book, so that you don't have to grab a dictionary everytime.
B000001Y16|5.0|This is definately one of Tupac's best albums, and my personal favorite. Every song on it is great, with some all time classics coming off this track. This probably has some of the best beats on a Tupac album. That combined with the tight lyrics makes for this all time classic album. A must buy!
0143036556|4.0|In \\"Collapse,\\" Jared Diamond expands on the ideas in his blockbuster, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" with this history of civilizations that lasted and those that didn't.  While the book is at times repetitive (the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), it is a fascinating, and scary, read.  His views on history are refreshingly wide in scope, contrasting with the \\"big man\\" viewpoint of history in my day, when humans were considered to have directed all their history, particularly with decisions by a few key historical figures.  Ecological constraints, as simple as the location of resources - water, food, etc.in contrasting Polynesian societies - has enormous consequences, Diamond notes.  So do cultural attitudes toward resources and non-resources, attitudes shared widely and not just among putative leaders.  Vikings died out in North America in good part because they valued some religious status items and traded away vital resources to support this choice.  Diamond notes a number of societies that have made it, for thousands of years, on a positive note.  The scary part to which I alluded is the number and strength of parallels between failed societies and our own.  Let's hope for an exception to Hegel's maxim, \\"We learn from history that we do not learn from history.\\"
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have been privileged to see the play at 2 venues and was extremely moved each time. However, nothing prepared me for the lavish spectacle that the movie offered. The music-magnificent, as always. The sets were breathtaking, offering a glimpse of the grandeur of early 1900's Paris and the opera house. What really impressed me the most is the \\"flash forward\\" to the \\"present\\"  done in black and white, which made the story line much clearer. The final ending of the movie really was a total surprise; not in the play and was fantastic! If there is any criticism at all, the phantom's vocal ability I thought was a bit weak, but was made up for by his acting. Top marks for this film! The best Webber adaptation to the screen as yet!
0151003084|1.0|I wish I could give this Zero stars.  It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it.  There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk?  Garbage in garbage out!

B000BYA5G4|3.0|Lord of War is based on real events, which is to say the writers gleaned ideas from account of real arms dealers.  The story is interesting, if not just a little drawn out.  Nicolas Cage does a good job, as does Jared Leto.  Ethan Hawke has a very minor role in the film and I think I would have enjoyed seeing him much more.<br /><br />The story is one that needs to be told, and told in a compelling manner.  It is told \\"OKish\\", but I think the movie took too long to get into the thick of the plot, and then stretched on for too long.  The end of the movie was the best part and really drove home several points.  It is too bad it took so long to get there.
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Director Kar Wai Wong is superb. The film has such a wonderful flow with it's cinematography. You have to see In The Mood For Love to understand what he's trying to do as a director. Actor Tony Leung Chiu Wai is all too charming in every scene.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For anyone who was sad to see Firefly go or anyone who found Firefly on DVD, will not doubt be getting this flick. It is that perfect cherry on top of one of the most brillant worlds ever created in not only Sci-Fi, but in Entertainment. The FX are awsmoe, the music is sweet, the characters are at their best, and lost of juicy secrets are revealed. I just wish it hadn't tanked and we'd be given more of the crew. The bonus features are great too, they really make you feel like as a viewer who loves this world you are a part of something really extraordinary.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Like most people who love literature I was well aware that Jane Austen could write, but the idea that Keira Knightley can act and hold her own against the likes of Dame Judi Dench was a revelation.  Granted, Knightley has not particularly been called upon to turn in great acting performances in most of her films.  In \\"Love Actually\\" she is basically required to look pretty and her best moments are reaction shots rather than dialogue.  She has many more moments such as that in \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" but she also proves herself proficient at the witty dialogue.  Knightley filmed this version as her final film as a teenager and the results are comparable to when Franco Zeffirelli cast the teenage Olivia de Hussey in \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\"<br /><br />This becomes the most romantic version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" because we are not surprised along with Lizzie when Darcy shows up and makes the most backhanded proposal of marriage in the history of Western literature.  The screenplay by Deborah Moggach (Emma Thompson receives special thanks in the credits, apparently for script doctoring) makes one significant change in the proceedings by simply having the moment when Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) falls for Lizzie clearly written on his face.  At the Meryton ball she finds the perfect moment to throw the callous words that she has overheard back into his and with the rapier still skewering her victim she turns on her heels and walks away in triumph.<br /><br />When next he sees her she has walked over to Mr. Bingley's house to care for her sister Jane (Rosamund Pike), who has been taken ill because of the matrimonial machinations of their mother.  Lizzie's hair is down and she is positively glowing.  When we see the look of Darcy's face it is clear that he is beyond smitten, even though through the veneer of upper class manners the signs are decidedly subtle.  From that moment on his affection becomes transparent to us, although Lizzie is surprised to learn of its existence.  Joe Wright also creates a motif where the first time Darcy and Lizzie touch, as he helps her into a carriage, resonates by an emphasis at key moments throughout the film of Darcy's hands.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is the most delightful of the Austen heroines because she has the virtue of not backing down.  Indeed, I believe Darcy first takes real notice of her because she stands up to him at the ball.  When she refuses to back down from Lady Catherine De Bourgh (Judi Dench) at the dinner table it struck me that one of the reasons she is so attractive to Darcy is because she is not trying to be.  Certainly Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blythen) has taught her five daughters it is how to be on their best behavior to catch a husband, and in a world of such propriety her candor is refreshing.  Darcy's curt dismissal of her looks as being tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt him, becomes ironic because for my money it is her brains that make Elizabeth Bennett a real beauty both to him and to us.<br /><br />The screenplay necessitates cutting much of the action to reduce the tale to a two-hour film.  I appreciated being spared the unfortunate incident of Mary at the pianoforte as well as the constructed scene for the final fadeout and my only minor complaint would be that Lady Catherine does not utter her exit line from the novel when she takes her leave of Elizabeth in their final confrontation although I fully understand that the words cannot be uttered under those circumstances and the fact that Lady Catherine shows up immediately on hearing the rumor makes up for being denied the pleasure of hearing Dame Judy declaim that line.<br /><br />I had heard that the Jane Austen Society was less than pleased by Knightley's posture in this film, but one of the strengths of this production is that the Bennetts clearly live in the country.  There are dirt roads that lead to their home, where a large hog wanders through the front door, and when Mr. Darcy and the Bingleys make theirfirst appearances at the local ball the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.  But the outside locations are as sumptuous as the gilded rooms in this film, and cinematographer Roman Osin makes both look gorgeous.<br /><br />For those who consider \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" to be the current cinematic benchmark for Austen adaptations I can report that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is its superior in terms of both romance and comedy by virtue of both crying and laughing more at this 2005 film..  Where Ang Lee's 1995 film comes out ahead is in its depiction of sisterhood, as Jane and Lizzie cannot rival Elinor and Marianne in their bonds of affection, which is understandable since it is more central to that Austen novel.  Even so there is a cute moment of confidences shared beneath the covers and Lizzie's spirited defense of her sister's shyness.  However, this one really is all about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />I am not at all surprise that Kngihtly received a Best Actress nomination for her performance in this film.  As is invariably the case with such films the cast of supporting players is superb.  Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennett is comically painful, but Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has a touching final scene with his daughter, Tom Hollander is toadally obnoxious as Mr. Collins, and my wife really wants to slap Jenna Malone's Lydia a couple of times.  The best thing I can say about this version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is that I went back to the theater to see it again, and the only other movie I did that for was \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" (I was using it for class).  This one was better.ball the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.  But the outside locations are as sumptuous as the gilded rooms in this film, and cinematographer Roman Osin makes both look gorgeous.      For those who consider \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" to be the current cinematic benchmark for Austen adaptations I can report that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is its superior in terms of both romance and comedy by virtue of both crying and laughing more at this 2005 film..  Where Ang Lee's 1995 film comes out ahead is in its depiction of sisterhood, as Jane and Lizzie cannot rival Elinor and Marianne in their bonds of affection, which is understandable since it is more central to that Austen novel.  Even so there is a cute moment of confidences shared beneath the covers and Lizzie's spirited defense of her sister's shyness.  However, this one really is all about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.    I am not at all surprise that Kngihtly received a Best Actress nomination for her performance in this film.  As is invariably the case with such films the cast of supporting players is superb.

B0001EFTVA|4.0|With a name like \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" I didn't know what to expect from this movie (for all I knew this was an adaptation of the american movie \\"The Godfather\\" hehehe). But I decided to give it a chance and see why this movie had gotten 3 stars (when it was out in the movie theaters). By the end, I felt like I had to watch it again, it was great. The visuals were fine, the story was intriguing, and overall I highly enjoyed it. The mix of comedy, seriousness, and touching emotions were put at just the right moments in the story that it just blended so well and helped to draw you into what was going on.    You won't find the big-eyed, super power, or robo tech type of animation here, which is popular with anime. This movie is done in a more realistic style. Nevertheless the drawings are done quite well.    All in all I think you'll find a winner with this movie.
0316172324|2.0|I thought the examples were good. If the research was accurately presented, it was compelling. The problem I had with the book is that it never presented any information on how one can work to develop one's own \\"blink\\" ability. There is the suggestion that it is possible to develop this capacity. I felt like a salesman had gotten me all excited about the features of this new, fabulous, remarkable car, then walked away from me refusing to work with me to buy it. SUMMARY: A big buildup to a big let down.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|My husband and I took our kids to see this movie in the theater and the whole family loved it.  We bought it as soon as it came out on DVD and have watched it several more times.  I do not usually like it when books are turned into movies, but this was well done.  While some content had to be added to make it feature film length, I feel it blended with the original story well.  It was like a picture book come to life.  Truly magical.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is truly one of the most creative and most underappreciated TV shows since \\"Freaks and Geeks\\". I dare anyone to stop watching this show after you get past the fourth episode. It is so original and the characters are extreemly likeable. Try it, and you will just as sad as I am that this show had to go away.
B000EE8M52|3.0|It's a digipack with three discs: Two CDS and a \\"DVD\\". It's aspect ratio is 4:3, the sound is a poor DD 2.0 at 192 Kbps, not Dolby Surround 2.1. The master is the same that the VHS edition. <br />Very curious but bad DVD, an mediocre VCD in DVD format.
B0007OASII|5.0|This is an excellent 7th album from the (Symphonic) Power Metal band Kamelot. Everything reigns with melody, harmonics, and terrific singing from Roy Khan. It's difficult to decide what is so great about this album as there are so many different factors:    1. The band is original. Continuing with their Ariel story (introduced in their last album, Epica) this concept album never slows down in tempo, or never drags. Each instrument balanced at the exact dynamics, doesn't overpower another instrument. The drumming applies to each theme of a song (for example in \\"March of Mephisto, the drumming resembles a pounding March), the bass is deep and the guitar has brilliant solos, similar to that in Epica.    2. Roy Khan's beautiful tenor voice seems to match well with the music and is smooth and flowing. Perhaps studying for 3 years as an opera vocalist has helped, but it is clear he has natural talent    3. The guest appearances. Shagrath from Dimmu Borgir appears in March of Mephisto - my favourite song in the whole album. The song starts like a battle scene, with Latin growling from Shagrath to a marching background. Roy's voice and Shagrath's voice seems to entwined like thread in the chorus, where Roy is powerfully singing (in an eerie manner) and Shagrath is growling \\"reminders of innocent youth.\\" The growling is remarkable for the theme of the song. The music is like a battle song and the 'March' is a consistent beat through the whole song.     4. He also appears on Memento Mori an 8.54-minute song, which starts off slow and symphonic, then bursts into a loud piece of music with a fantastic head-banging beat. At the chorus there appears to be two voice singing together and Roy's voice sounds electronic. At the 5.00 mark Shagrath's voice comes in, along with a female vocalist called Mari. It is quite a Gothic song, with all due respect. I'm not saying it's a Gothic metal song; but gothic elements are the female opera singing, the symphonic strings all the way through,and when Shagrath's voice comes in, the 'beauty and the beast' effect kicks in. (the 'beauty and the beast' voice is common in gothic/metal music, where there's a male death growler and female vocalist). A very good strong song.    5. Simone Simons (from Epica) sings with Khan in the beautifully heavy The Haunting (Somewhere In Time). The vocals interlock together wonderfully. The music is haunting and mesmerising.    6. There gentle moments too! Abandoned is a light piano track with beautiful female vocals and Khan singing is heart out to the strings and epic guitars.    7. Solos are abundant and played with skill and virtuosity. You notice things you haven't heard before the second time round, because of the excellent musical arrangements. Each song is complex and allows several musical interpretations. Just listen to the riffing in Moonlight, or the solos of Nothing Ever Dies or Serenade!    8. Apart from the usual guitar, bass and drums, each song is adorned with strings, pianos and Gregorian chanting. This means all the songs are atmospheric and meaningful. The strings in Soul Society and When The Lights Go Down are fabulous.    As a piano/ guitar player I seem to favour those instruments more but I honestly can say I find it difficult to choose a favourite in this album. The vocals (as I've stressed) show a lot of tremendous talent. Thomas Youngblood is the only guitarist, but it sounds like there's another player with him! The bass (Glenn Barry) adds a rich depth to all the songs, and makes them powerful.  I've already mentioned the practically flawless drumming by Casey Grillo, but I'll mentioned it again: the beat in each song is not overdone, but performed precisely how they SHOULD be performed, perfectly. Oliver Palotai plays the keyboards, a personal favourite instrument of mine, and he never fails to deliver superb performances, from the diminished creepy arpeggio in March to Mephisto, to the tender emotional Abandoned.     Favourite songs: March of Mephisto, The Black Halo, Moonlight and Memento Mori but I really love them all.    I'm afraid the 30 second samples on Amazon don't do much justice for this masterpiece, so I suggest you go buy the album!
B000001FDI|4.0|For the reviewer who asked about the \\"bonus tacks\\" titled Exchange And Mart and Spending All My Days, these tracks were actually demos for a Rick Grech solo album that was never released.  They were included on an official release of Blind Faith (1986?), but you are right, they are not actually Blind Faith numbers.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is a MUST SEE for all you Cats fans!  It's absolutely WONDERFUL!! I give it 5 stars all around!!  Great musical! :)
B00000F14B|5.0|There aren't many DVDs that I want to own, i.e., not many movies I'd care to watch more than once, but this is definitely one of them.    I first saw this wonderful Meredith Willson musical as a child, and have loved it ever since.  It's one of America's answers to a Puccini opera (which I also find sublime). (Another might be \\"Guys and Dolls\\".)  The DVD has a lovely extra, about the making of the musical, hosted by Shirley Jones (who, one learns, was pregnant during the filming of the movie).    One disappointment is that they morphed my favorite song from the Broadway show - the great \\"My White Knight\\" - into the mediocre \\"Being In Love.\\"  I have no idea why they did that, other than possibly they felt it fit better with the dialog, though if the latter played on Broadway for 1375 performances, I don't know why they couldn't have fit it into the movie. I can't imagine that it was out of Shirley Jones' range.  (And, I doubt there was any racial political correctness involved, back in 1962.) Just a bad choice, I guess.    Also somewhat disappointing is that the movie version of my other favorite song from this show - \\"Till There Was You\\" (covered famously by the Beatles) - is inferior to the Broadway version, which has it as a lovely duet with Robert Preston, while the movie has Shirley Jones singing it alone.    On the plus side, the Barbershop quartet songs, and especially the Buffalo Bills' duet with Shirley Jones (\\"Lida Rose\\" and \\"Will I Ever Tell You?\\"), are top notch.  I LOVE it when two melodies are woven together richly and seamlessly (another prime example being \\"Moonglow\\" and \\"Theme from Picnic\\"), and Willson does it in this musical several times.  It's a subtle but genuine tour de force.    A bit of trivia: one of my favorite bands from the late 1960s, Spanky and Our Gang, recorded their own, delightful version of \\"Ya Got Trouble\\".  So, between them and The Beatles, you know that Meredith Willson came up with some memorable tunes and lyrics here.    I can't end this review without also mentioning the stellar performance by Pert Kelton in the role of the widow Paroo.  Her acting, voice, and intonations are perfect, which makes it understandable why she played the role both on stage and in the film.  The way she sighs and looks off into the distance after one of her encounters with the spell-binding Professor Harold Hill is unforgettable.    If you're a music-lover, you can't regret owning this DVD.  But for the CD, don't buy the movie soundtrack, but get the Broadway version. It also stars the incomparable Robert Preston, but features a flawless performance by Barbara Cook, singing the role of Marian (Madam Librarian) Paroo.
1594200653|5.0|The amount of information Tony Judt is able to gather, order and analyze in this work is emarkable. Unlike many academics, Professor Judt is not afraid to take a firm (yet objective) stance on any (that is, sensitive) issues -- nor does he fool around when it comes to evidence. The book is packed solid with information that is interwove with a straight-forward, easy-to-read style: not a word is misused or thrown away. Written with the confidence that only comes with great understanding, European History Since 1945 is a bold, impactful and definitive narrative of European development and national identity.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I don't have any idea where to start. I love this movie. Ya gotta see it now. The music takes your breath away. It takes you to romantic heights that I myself can't explain. Everyone sings themselves and they really sing great. Costumes are beatiful, the scenery if awesome and you have to watch it at least once a day. Please <br />bare with me I just can't say enough good things, and wonderful feeling that I have in watching this masterpiece of One of my favorite opera's. Enjoy Enjoy.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Surround sound remixes tend to be maligned by hardcore fans, usually because hardcore fans assume that the album is being disrespected by someone else's interpritation of the music. I just take it for what it is: an interpritation that is not meant to replace the original album, just add some new spice.<br /><br />The DVD-mix made me appreciate the CD much more than I ever did. I always liked Fear of Music, but given the choice I listened to Remain in Light, Stop Making Sense, and Speaking in Tongues more often. I've been addicted to Fear of Music since getting the album for christmas.<br /><br />I think the reissue is excellent for what reissues provide -- a cleaner, louder version of music that would be great even if played on a wax tube. Also, I really like the alternate version of Cities on the disc.<br /><br />I haven't had a problem playing the CD in my DVD player (which is about 5-6 years old now), though to rip the CD to disk I had to use my older computer (also 5 years old). My year-old laptop CD drive didn't acknowledge either side of the disc. Anyway, get creative. it's worth it.
B0009UC810|4.0|They're on a mission from God, it's 106 miles to Chicago, they've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark and they're wearing sunglasses.  <br /> <br />If you liked Animal House, you'll appreciate the same bits of absurd, random humor found in this film along with the classic music that has helped shape America.  A fun film to watch which many have considered to be the gateway to their interest in the blues.  The all-star cast of Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, James Brown, Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and others make quite a dynamic musical comedy.   <br /> <br />My only problem is that my DVD continues to display french subtitles each time I load the disc despite turning them off each time.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Believe the hype: this is wonderful television, right up there with Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The character development is intriguing, and the series keeps you guessing both in terms of the mystery of Lilly Kane's murder and what Veronica will do next (and with whom).  I got this through my library and then just had to own it.<br /><br />I hope to goodness there will be a Season 3.
0895260131|1.0|See how Spencer has cherry picked his information:<br /><br />\\"Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors.

B0006399FS|1.0|The Mighty have a long way to fall . . . and gosh it hurts my ears, as well as well as momentarily vanquishing some of my very fond U2 memories. <br /> <br />Sometimes, in a romance, the sadness and bickering in a long, slow goodbye make it tough to remember some of the great times . . . at least, until it's finally over.  That's how I feel about U2 listening to this utterly sleep-inducing, painfully bad album.  I've tried . . . and tried again . . . oh, maybe it'll sound good now . . . no . . . maybe now . . . nope, it's the same . . .  <br /> <br />They really should have broken up in '97 after Pop, and before that ridiculous tour - absolute latest!  This and ATYCLB have one fantastic song each and then a decaying smorgasbord of what can nicely be called filler . . . filler dressed up like it's \\"classic\\".  Um, er-it's not. <br /> <br />A lot of people won't say it, but I will:  U2 has no clothes on anymore.   <br /> <br />They're doing what Zeppelin, the Stones, R.E.M, and so many more have done before them - stay in the store way past closing time.  There's no heat in there anymore, guys.  No power. <br /> <br />U2 has made some of the most gorgeous music on earth . . . from '84 to 91 is an aural paradise, where these former geniuses once mesmerized not only our ears but our minds and hearts.  They explored new territory with gusto, and the lyrics and political messages were Nobel Prize worthy.  They inspired us! The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby are all masterpieces.  They slipped after that - we all do sometimes - but Zooropa and Pop are still half amazing. <br /> <br />This album is horrific.  It's like all outtakes from the glory days - songs that time has passed by, or better yet should never have been recorded.  The band seems to need the attention now, instead of striving to make us smile in wonder.  They're like popular kids in jr. high, probably upset that upstart Coldplay (just awful too, and getting worse) is maybe getting more and more looks from the pretty cheerleaders.  Good grief. <br /> <br />The singles sound ok initially, but age like cheese in the Sahara Desert in August.  All Because of You, Man and a Woman, and One Step Closer shouldn't even be on a C-Side boxed set when they eventually do break up in 2019 - they're that bad.  Crumbs from Your Table is a total minor chord, stunningly lame derivative of that walk on song from the previous dull album (only great song was track 9 there, amazing!), which already has a nod to Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For . . .  <br /> <br />U2, what are you looking for now?  To explore?  Invent?  Break new ground?  Give us a feeling of triumph, of joy?  You used to . . . well, nothing lasts forever . . . I think, U2, you just want the world to say how great you are, again . . . and again . . . a hideous addiction fame is to some people, clearly - that's all this band is looking for now, their music absolutely corrupted and forsaken for empty, naked world glory.  <br /> <br />I saw a picture of them with their Grammy's.  Bono and the Edge all smiling.  Larry looked annoyed, and not happy to be there.  I think he knows what the score is, and would rather be in Disneyland - that's how bad being in U2 is now for someone with a brain.   <br /> <br />I applaud Bono's good works, but I think he can keep doing that without hurting our ears with another grievously washed up album like this. Please guys, do us all a favor and call it a day, and bask in the memories in California, Ireland, Jamaica, Antarctica - anywhere, so long as it's not in a recording studio there. <br /> <br />And my last thought is a nice one.  I love Miracle Drug.  Magnificent chorus . . . made me think of the earlier albums.  And I gotta say . . . I can remember them again, and still deeply enjoy those beautiful songs from days past . . . make new memories with them today . . . HTBAAB will eventually break my dustbuster, if I ever try to clean it.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|Except for censorhip of Greenday! Only one (and edited) song was left in the DVD of their great performance in Berlin. What a shame.
B00005JO9J|5.0|If Scrubs and ER had a love child Grey's Anatomy would be it!  Grey's Anatomy is the perfect mix of comedy and drama.  It is an extremely well written show that couldn't have a better theme.  The diversity of the characters is unbelievable.  They are so well suited to play opposite each other.  I don't think there has been a better casting combination since Friends (and that's saying a lot)!
B000B8IA2G|4.0|First seasons are always hard especially following in the shadow of Stargate SG-1 but Atlantis is living up to the potential.  There are a few episodes that could have been upped a bit but for season 1 it was very well done with actors and storylines.  The potential for a thousand and one things is there and hopefully it will be as successful as it's sister show.
0142002038|4.0|The basic frame of all the James Bond books and movies. It was the book chosen by the owners of the film rights to introduce the character to the screen - and they kept rather close to the essentials ... the tough but sophisticated Bond, the alluring female lead who becomes his companion and usually savior, the gruff but proud M and so on. Probably the best example of the movie being as good as the book - certainly not true of the later cartoonish movies which are seldom as good as the original Fleming stories.
B0002858YS|2.0|I wasn't planning on writing a review for this, but when I noticed everyone and their mother praising these guys as the \\"SaViOrZzZzZ Of RaWk!!!\\", I had to step in and say... well, no. No, they're not. <br /> <br />I don't hate the Killers. I've heard their album (my ex-roomate had it, and he would always blast it and warble the lyrics in that damn dying-camel singing voice of his), and from what I've heard, I think they have potential. For one thing, they're not emo, which is always a good thing (at least in this day and age), and a couple parts *are* catchy, I can't deny it. But as they stand, they need a lot of work. This album is very cliche and boring, and really does little, if anything, to reach in and grab the listener. Let's not forget how much work the songwriting needs: \\"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\". ??? I'm not even going to get into that one. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very blah affair. Like I said, the Killers may have potential, but this album? Mehh. BOORRRRRRRRIIINNGGGG. There's worse out there for sure, but there is so much better. Just keep your ears open, and refuse to be fed the nonsense that MTV and radio are trying to feed you. <br /> <br />Or just click \\"No\\" below. Whatever.
0099445093|5.0|This great novel chronicles the life of a man embodying that rare quality which Kenneth Rexroth described as \\"magnanimity\\". As we read of his difficulties and of the people in his life who constantly torment and betray him, the lower part of our nature continually cries out to this fictional character, \\"Get out,for God's sake! Just leave!\\" But of course it is just his refusal to \\"get out\\" which gives Stoner his longevity and nobility, and which redeems him in the final moments of his life (I can hardly ever remember being so moved by the closing pages of a novel.) Stoner is reminiscent of Ford Madox Ford's Christopher Tietjens, the center point of his tetralogy, PARADE'S END, another forgotten 20th century masterpiece. Like Tietjens, William Stoner refuses to cast off the liabilities of his life for any reason; in his review of the Ford novel for the Saturday Evening Post, Rexroth graced Tietjens with the summit of his own brand of critical praise (hard won indeed) by deeming him one of the last of the magnanimous men in literature. I hope that Rexroth had occasion to read \\"Stoner\\".
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I have to agree with other reviews that they do the old school metal well.  They do it without being cheesy or annoying.  There is enough screaming vocals to make to keep it from seeming old.  Although, the singing is quite good too.  Every song holds its own and I could listen to them over and over.  Two songs, \\"All These Things I Hate\\" and \\"The End\\" start off slower but they went to the Pantera school of power ballads (\\"This Love\\", etc.) and kick it in the ass through out the song.  Over all, a great listen.  Buy it.
0307276902|3.0|I ordered and started reading the book before the truth was revealed that it has is a combination of truth and fiction.  The fact that the author lied about so many of the characters and events has definitely changed my opinion and I have not been able to enjoy the book as much as I could have.  I decided to read the book to help my friend who is dealing with a child with drug problems, but feel it would be ridiculous to give it to them now.
B000002UAI|4.0|This was the Beatles fourth album.  It's a good album, but a bit below the Beatles usual standards.  Lennon and McCartney ran short on song ideas, so there are only eight of their songs here.  \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\", \\"Baby's in Black\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week\\" are classics.  But there are also below average Lennon/McCartney songs like \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\", which normally would have been given away to somebody like Peter & Gordon.  There are also six cover songs here.  Most of them are very good, especially \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" and \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\".  But there is also \\"Mr. Moonlight\\", which is probably the worst song the Beatles ever recorded.  It's a bad song, complete with cheesy organ solo.  Overall, it's a very good album, but not as good as most of the other Beatles albums.
B000002G7E|3.0|I am a big Velvet Underground fan, but this album is far from their best. Lest you think I am a pedestrian fan who abhorrs their crazy noise jams, think again. I love every facet of the Velvets, but this LP lacks what made the other Velvet albums so great, top notch songwriting.  <br />Track by track: <br />1. White Light/White Heat: <br />Lou Reed's love letter to amphetamines, this song delivers a kick to the face to start the album. With the band cooking along like Chuck Berry on speed, Lou spit/sings the lyrics like a recent convert who has decided to tell you about his new discovery. Great start to the album. <br />2. The Gift: <br />An interesting experiment that ultimately fails because it doesn't hold up to repeated listenings. While the band delivers a funk groove (also known as \\"Booker T\\" on the box set) in the right channel, John Cale reads a story in the left speaker concerning Waldo's attempt to mail himself to the girl he loves. <br />The twist ending is interesting, but after you heard it once, you  <br />realize that it is an 8 minute story with no melody. You'll skip past this one after the first two listens. <br />3. Lady Godiva's Operation: <br />A great riff forms the backbone of the music during the verses, and Cale's creepy vocal fits perfectly. The annoying interjections by Reed halfway through piss you off after the first two, but the story about a botched sex change wins points for being weird & cool simultaneously. <br />4. Here She Comes Now: <br />A seemingly innocent (albeit dark) little pop song, the seemingly throwaway track will install itself onto your mental harddrive, and suddenly you will realize you have been humming the melody for the last two weeks. Insanely catchy, in a lovely way. <br />5. I Heard Her Call My Name: <br />Here is where the album gets REALLY interesting. A furious methedrine driven squall of fuzz guitar and Lou raving, this song epitomizes the Velvets insane rawk side, and is the perfect track <br />to play forsomebody who has only heard Pale Blue Eyes or Sweet Jane. It features Lou's most deranged & fractured guitar playing, and the music gains in intensity until it's, um, \\"White Hot\\", and explodes in feedback howls and the sounds of an amp that just commited suicide. Amazing. <br />6. Sister Ray: It once again features lyrics about drugs, and some of the same feedback bursts as the previous track, but with none of the same searing intensity as the rest of the album. It is also 17 minutes long, and while I love long tracks (i.e. Miles Davis, Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, Crazy Horse), this one goes NOWHERE. It seems like they tried to combine track one's lyrics & track five's guitar raveup, and not only failed to suceed, but failed for 17 minutes. This song is loved, but I'm not sure why. <br /> <br />In conclusion, 3 of the tracks, (White Light/White Heat, Here She Comes, I Heard Her Call My Name) are great, the other three are subpar. Interesting note, the three great tracks were all written by Lou alone, the other three included writing by the other members. It seems Lou learned his lesson though, because the next LP was written by Lou alone........

B000002N2P|5.0|Since Green Day's major studio debut album \\"Dookie\\", this band has been a personal favorite and still is number one even after over ten years of listening to their musical growth.  I think \\"Insomniac\\" is truly a great album whose lyrics of self-loathing, abandonment, rejection, and cynicism and catchy power chords reflect the true essence of Green Day, punk.  While I like virtually all of their albums, \\"Insomniac\\" is still my top pick, even since its debut ten years ago. It's too bad you don't see this one in stores anymore.  Highlights of the album include Armatage Shanks, Stuck With Me, Geek Stink Breath, 86,  Brain Stew/Jaded, the overlooked Tight Wad Hill, and Walking Contradiction.  While their riff stylings for this album are similar in several songs, it doesn't stop this from being a hard-edged, fast-paced, punch-in-the-face collection of Green Day's finest punk songs.  Despite being an album of sheer negativity and mental anguish, this remains the best of the bunch.  Highly recommended for Green Day fans, or punk fans in general!
B0007PAMR4|2.0|A Looong time coming... AND it's still not here.  I have always LOVED this movie and the book and as several reviewers have pointed out IF you could mesh the Sci-fi mini-series into- it would ALMOST be complete!  I have scoured the planet for years trying to find a COMPLETE copy of this movie and still have to continue.  As eagerly as I anticipated this release (what? 2 or 3 times) I was as sorely disappointed.  HOW can you call a movie the \\"extended edition\\" and still leave scenes out THAT are in the \\"theatrical release\\" (which you can see if you flip the disc over {What's wrong MCA the cost of silk-screening a disc too much for you?} and some of those weren't in the \\"theatrical release\\" when it was released in theatres!)  IF this was supposed to be the \\"extended edition\\" why not have ALL the scenes in it on one side?  Some were removed, cropped, and several seemed out of sequence.  WHY can't someone just release the \\"Utimate Dune\\"?  Some of the deleted scenes are ACTUALLY in the movie IF you ever had a chance to see the Japanese Laser-disc version that was released years ago (the Shadout Mapes \\"testing\\" Lady Jessica).  Of course, it spans 4 VHS tapes and won't last forever like this DVD unfortunately will.  The only reason I gave this movie two stars is that I truly do LOVE the movie AND the attractive collector's case that it came with, but beyond that- this was a pathetic attempt.  Try again MCA.
055357342X|5.0|As both a writer and historian, I find George R.R. Martin's A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3) yet another masterpiece in his astonishing series.  He combines high fantasy with an uncanny knowledge of historical accuracy.  His descriptions of warfare, political intrique, religion, art and lifestyle could be lifted from histories of the Celts to the Mongols to the Europeans of the Middle Ages.  I highly recommend the entire series for readers who wished to be swept away to another time and another place.  Don't forget to buckle your seatbelts!

Which one a person becomes depends on where he or she is raised. If he is in a oppressed country like Palestine or Iraq, do you expect him to become a peace-loving happy-meal eating person? We can label them all normal or we can label them all terrorists, which is what this author is attempting do by giving 1/2 verses of the Quran.<br /><br />I am a Muslim and this book even gave me doubts about my faith, but then I went back to the basics of why I am a Muslim and why I believe in Allah and it is because of the living miracle given to the prophet Muhammad which is the Quran.

B000E0WJIC|5.0|There's only one way to put it.  These guys just flat out rock!  Their appreciation for old school metal (ala Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc...) is apparrent.  with hard driving, pounding beats, harmony leads a-plenty,  and melodies that surprisingly hold the songs together this album flows like a well worn path down a never-ending road to oblivion where  the final conflict includes you getting your head kicked in.  Old meets new as a constant metal pounding meets emo, meets british metal.  These guys have certainly started a trend that never needs to stop.  A 10 on the richter scale of heavy.  Not for the faint of heart.

B000002KEV|4.0|I loved this album back in 1972 and I'm still amazed by it's sonic impact today. Deep Purple's recording engineer Martin Burch was asked to capture some shows from the 1972 Machine Head Tour on tape. During the August 1972 Japanese leg of the tour, he had his chance to record. Burch was supplied with an unimpressive, cheap looking Ampex 8-track recorder to get the job done. Burch was dissapointed with the equipment he was given and was certain that the results would be a total waste of his time.  <br />When the entourage arrived back in England, Burch took the time to throw the eight track recording tapes onto a studio deck and have a listen. COMPLETE AND TOTAL SHOCK !!! The combination of skillful microphone placement, concert hall acoustics and the unexpected superior performance of that little Ampex tape deck had collectively ganged up to capture one of the finest quality live rock recordings of all time.  <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|I adore Colin Firth. There are no words to describe this movie. The Chemistry between Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is so amazing. I watched the 2006 movie and it is okay but it doesn't begin to compare to this Movie.  I watched it at least five times already and I just bought it about a month ago. The only thing is that I wish there could be a sequel to this one. One with the same actors in it and from the point where they get married and go on from there. If you have never watched any of the versions of Pride and Prejudice, please get this one first. You will not regret it!! I would give this 10 stars if I could... ENJOY!!

1932100385|5.0|The information isn't really new. But the fact that it is backed up by mountains of research, and yet is being actively repressed by the powers it threatens makes it all the more powerful. Basically it says follow the same eating habits the hippies have been promoting for the last thirty years, and you can't get heart disease, cancer or auto-immune diseases. Can't get them. They can't prosper without animal protein. So keep the animal protein (particularly dairy) to a minimum, and eat only whole plant foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts...). For the past five weeks I have been doing the best(but not religiously) to follow the findings of the studies, without any expectations. The results have been nothing short of remarkable. I used to have the hardest time getting out of bed. When I exercised or walked, it felt like I was carrying my body around. Now I am hyper. I jump out of bed in the morning, I work out. I go on long hikes... daily. It is almost too much. My persona was built around being mellow. Being in love with being in bed. Being calm and consistent. It really has been a bit tough, on me and my friends (who IS this guy, and what happened to el Deano?). Highly recommended. <br />For the complete review see greenagogo.com
6305327084|5.0|I ike any movie with Matt Dillon. The bonus was Tim Hutton too. Two good actors and good supporting cast.
0743201140|5.0|This book is a great follow-on to the first Buckingham book, \\"First Break all the Rules\\".  It is an indepth look at how companies can and should alter their perception of employees, building a workforce around strengths, creating an entirely new paradigm.  The fact that Buckingham has backed up his theories with such a breadth of research is refreshing.  It takes a human resource-type discipline and gives it a systematic and measured path. I believe this should be required reading for every CEO, HR manager and business leader.  Well written, understandable and highly engaging.  The testing tool is great.  I would suggest buying from Amazon via the internet on this one - books bought in a public book store can have the code stolen from the fly cover.
B00003CX95|5.0|A modern classic. A great historic story brought to life by great actors.Action, fun and romance in a very good mix. Made me go to Scotland to see all those places for real.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|\\"Hostel,\\" Eli Roth's follow up to the disease ridden \\"Cabin Fever,\\" has everything a true horror fan could possibly want.  It's gory, disturbing, violent, and full of nudity and drug use.  I was most impressed with the ORIGINAL story line, which was such a disturbing concept that it haunted me for days.  It was so nice to see a horror film in theaters that wasn't a remake.   <br /> <br />This DVD should be spectacular because it's unrated, and will no doubt be more bloody, have some great special features, and interesting commentary by Roth.  If you haven't seen Hostel and are a fan or horror, I highly reccommend this film. <br /> <br />Pros about the movie:  <br />The acting was believable, and I liked each of the characters, whether I was for, or against them.  I really enjoyed the story, and everything was tied together in the end.  The tourture scenes were graphic and brutal, and the atmosphere was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the ending, which I won't give away here (let's just say revenge plays a key part).  The more I thought about this movie after seeing it, the more I liked it.  It sticks with you (or at least it did with me). <br /> <br />Cons about the movie:  <br />It took a long time to get into the bloody action, and I thought it could have been slightly more gory for effect.  If the movie had focused more on the torture side of the tale verses the \\"party\\" side, it might have been better overall.  There were some unrealistic moments, which is to be expected, and of course, a lot of unnecessary nudity.  There was also an over-abundance of drug use, but it adds a little to the story, and besides, you get the feeling that's half the reason these boys left the good old USA anyway. <br /> <br />Overall, I really enjoyed this film and am definitely buying the DVD in April.  It's a bloody good time, and its original story is sure to gain it a permanent spot in classic horror cinema.
B000BVD460|4.0|Eminem doesn't have so many records to have a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, but it's useful for people that haven't bought any of his previous albums.<br /><br />The selection is pretty good:<br /><br />- \\"The Way I am\\" \\"Stan\\" \\"The real Slim Shady\\", from the Marshall Maters LP<br /><br />- \\"Guilty conscience\\", \\"My name is\\" from The Slim Shady LP<br /><br />- \\"Cleaning out my closet\\", \\"Sing for the moment\\", \\"Without me\\" from The Eminem Show<br /><br />- \\"Just lose it\\", \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Mockinbird\\" from Encore<br /><br />The new songs add very little to his career. I'd love that the CD have some videos (like Stan and Guilty Conscience) instead the new songs.<br /><br />The good thing is to have all these songs together with \\"Lose Yourself\\", from the 8-mile soundtrack and the Stan version with Elton John.<br /><br />For people that have all the records, it's an unnecesary buy. It's just for die-hard fans.
B00005221M|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis is one of my favorite actors, Madeleine Stowe is a pleasure to look at, and Michael Mann has made much better movies than this one.<br /><br />There's nothing glaringly WRONG with this film...there's just nothing impressively RIGHT about it.  Pacing is slow, the fight scenes are weak especially compared to say \\"Braveheart\\" or even \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and even the soundtrack starts to get a bit annoyingly repetitive after a while.  Also the plot is fairly predictable, I could see from the first 10 minutes that the innocent yet brave (gasp!) American settlers were about to get royally screwed over by their British overlords, and that Stowe and Lewis were bound to hook up.<br /><br />To its credit the ending is a little unexpected however, and even risks wandering into some pseudo-philosophical cheesiness, but it relies on a totally inexplicable and implausible event (Lewis' adopted Mohican brother confronting the crazy Huron warlord by himself and getting killed in the process).  Not a good way to finish an already underwhelming film.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I am a fan of everything that The Black Keys have released to date, but i think this may be my favorite of their releases. It is very similar in style to their previous albums, but it is less fuzzy sounding, as though it is more produced. This album is their follow up to \\"Thick Freakness\\" which is also an incredible album, yet, this one seems more mature. Their is more use of loops on this album, which give it a much fuller sound, and the album was actually recorded in the rubber factory in their hometown of Akron Ohio. Their fast paced blues on this album is great, but my favorite track is actually \\"The Lengths\\", which is completely unique to their style. It is a beautiful yet simple, slow love song. Althought the music isnt necessarilly their most complex, or impressive, still my favorite, right up there with \\"The Big Come Up\\", their debut which is credited as their best.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|A lovely take of Jane Austin's novel. Excellent direction and the actors really do justice to their charactors. Set in 18th century England, you get a glimpse into that world of what it was like to be an \\"old maid\\" in the aristocracy.  If you want a good romantic drama with a good ending, then this is the movie for you!
B000000P17|2.0|O.K., let's get one thing straight: I love Guns N' Roses. What I don't love, however, is this collection of cover songs, which includes the unlisted bonus track \\"Look at Your Game, Girl\\" (written by mass murderer Charles Manson). It's kind of a grab-bag of the bands' favorite old punk songs, and not really a true GN'R album. Get it (if you must) as close to dirt-cheap as possible. 'Nuff said.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I received the item in good time and it was in great condition. Thanks very much, my daughter loved it. (that is my excuse for buying it for myself)
6304712936|5.0|I picked up a copy of \\"Amadeus\\" a few months ago because I had never seen it before and I thought it would be worth a look.  I admit that I postponed watching it because it runs practically 3 hours and I never seemed to have that much spare time.  When my daughter's friend looked over my video collection, focussed immediately on \\"Amadeus\\" to the near exclusion of everything else, and called it his favorite movie of all time, I figured that maybe it's time to take a look.  I'm certainly glad I did.  This is an outstanding movie that should please the history buffs, the costume drama buffs, and, especially, the music buffs.  The story of Mozart is compelling enough but the writer and director found an angle to view his life that reaches a level of excellence rarely seen in movie biographies.  The little-known composer; Salieri, is the protagonist and is played with excellence by F. Murray Abraham.  Frankly, I knew so little about the movie that I always thought the little-known Abraham got his Best Acting Oscar for portraying Mozart.  <br /> <br />This angle of viewing Mozart through the eyes of a jealous composer humanizes Mozart so well that a person can't help but be touched even more so by his life.  In the end, we bemoan the loss of both men's lives in the waste of a one-sided competition.  In the midst of this brilliant script is a bountiful gift of Mozart's music and it is delivered in just the right dose and just the right visual accompaniment.  Even if Mozart isn't your cup of tea, I doubt that you'll fail to be moved by his movements.  Well, I could go on and on but the point is, I am glad that I finally sat down to watch \\"Amadeus\\".  It is a reminder that artistry well-focussed has an appeal all its' own.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Every scene of this amazing movie is brought to life by the music that Gustavo Santaolalla either created or chose. To say it is memorable is a vast understatement - I cannot wait for the movie to come out on DVD. (I've alreaady seen the film numerous times) - and the music makes the impact of the film even stronger.
B0000024ZT|5.0|I don't care much for his sweaty leather hairy-man machismo, but I can always appreciate a lyric that turns my head in a knot. This, his debut album, has the best balance of poetry, rock and roll and persona. After this, he seemed to become a mumbling caricature of himself. Here, he's fresh, smart and audible. Greetings from Asbury Park is a must-have record for any collection of late 20th century American music.<br /><br />One other note: hopefully they will release an improved remastering of this excellent album. As of this date, the only CD available is over-compressed, congested, low-fi, reminiscent of the AM radios we had in our cars when it came out. (I have a better sound system now.) Enjoy!
B000002J09|5.0|There is a lot of debate surrounding this album as to which is the greatest rock album of all time. Well, I usually don't fall for this \\"greatest of all time\\" thingy. You could cry and howl from your rooftops all night as to how objective you are....oh sure...you know how it is...In spite of having a hugely slappable face, I think I am the most handsome man in the whole country....of course my wife Pearl thinks the same way....heck, you might say, I can sure believe what Pearl says...but what you don't know is that half of the time she doesn't wear her eyeglasses and the other half of the time, she is drunk...so there you go... <br /> <br />Ah well, coming back to the album...all of us will never agree as to whether this is THE greatest or one of the greatest recordings of all time...hey pal, I know that we all at least agree on the things that annoy us most...like pigs, rats and Paris Hilton.... <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin sure was a great band...and Jimmy Page sure was a great guitarist...heck, he has to be...50 million people would not pay to hear ME play the guitar on a recording (even my two cats run for cover when I pick up the guitar, but I am not sure how that is relevant here).... <br /> <br />Now to my subjective opinion about this album (I am drunk right now, so I might change my opinion after dinner):  <br /> <br />I consider this album among the top 10 albums of all time and I believe that it is the best among all the works of Led Zeppelin...highly recommended.  <br /> <br />I don't know if you like the wailing of Plant...but I like it and I usually try howling at home like Plant does and on Saturday my neighbor Eddie thought that I was dying and called 911...thanks Eddie anyway.... <br /> <br />Izzy <br />
B000E97Y6K|5.0|What a Beautiful & amazing movie! Naomi Watts is absolutely breath-taking!  This is now my all time favorite besides Batman Begins, Pearl Harbor and Titanic!   This remake of King Kong has so much heart, so much feeling, so much passion! I saw it a third time just today. This is, hands down, the BEST motion picture that I have ever seen in my life! It was AMAZING! So thrilling! The acting was incredible! The characters have such depth! The special effects are magnificent!  The musical score by James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) is amazing! This movie was pure entertainment with so much heart! I looked around & didn't see a dry eye anywhere.   I have to say though, I think Peter Jackson may have fibbed just a tiny bit. He said that this remake is solely inspired from the 1933 classic that he loved so much staring Fay Wray. Well, in that version, Fay Wray was terrified of Kong from the moment she was sacrificed to Kong until the moment he was killed. It was Jessica Lange that started the caring for Kong thing. So I think the 1976 version inspired Peter Jackson more then he's letting on.   This incarnation of King Kong is the absolute best though! It's just phenomenal! Two Thumbs up to Naomi Watts! She was brilliant in this movie! You could totally feel the bond that formed between her and Kong! She was amazing! What an incredible and wonderful movie! I can't wait to own this and the Director's Cut on DVD!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead, one of my all time favorite bands. i've just now discovered has ripped off another band i like (maybe even more now considering the following) a mexican band as a matter of fact. ouch, i know, THERE THERE, one of my favorite songs from this album. If you doubt me (as i'm sure you will) listen to METAMORFOSIS by Cafe Tacuba on the 'Avalancha de Exitos'96 album, which is a cover of a bunch of old mexican hits played Cafe Tacuba style, which the band obviously paid their respects to. (released '96) and you will sadly go through what i went through...and once again.. i'm sorry.  .. worst of all, this was the song rh chose to release as their first single.. darn.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|What a phenomenal job they did with this movie! I loved the other films too but what a fantastic fresh start for a new series of Batman movies! This is the Batman film that we were waiting for! Everything about this movie was amazing! The cast, the sets, the characters, the soundtrack! The musical score by James Newton Howard (KING KONG) and Hans Zimmer is so intense! It's awesome! Everything about this movie is amazing! I am already looking forward to the sequels! I hope that there are many to follow!  Christian Bale was an excellent choice for the title character!  I am a huge fan of his work now!   Would love to see Harley Quinn and the Joker team up!  And if it's done with the excellence of Nolan, hopefully she will be introduced in one sequel then reek havoc in the following.  Just an idea.  BATMAN BEGINS is excellent!  A must own! <br />
0767812387|5.0|After watching the film and wanting to get up and dance to the music this CD is a dream come true ! \\"Echa Pa'Lante\\" is now one of my favourite Cha Cha's and Ruby's Rumba \\"Eres Todo En Mi\\" is great to dance with a special partner. <br /> <br />\\"Jazz Machine - Black Machine\\" is a great Samba track which will also get you on the dance floor. If the film inspired you to get up and dance this CD should be on your playlist !
B000BT97AO|2.0|In a few words, I wasn't really crazy about it. I remember seeing the book for it in a bookstore some time ago and thinking that this movie was going to be dark and really cool and it was dark indeed, but sadly the plot was very boring. the cg environments were very cool to look at but the characters were not. Movies like the dark crystal, never ending story and labrynth are comparable to this in genre and all had a plot, a mood and an objective storyline. This was just random eye candy. I'm giving this one 2 stars, because it looks really nice and the cinematography was well done. Visually, the movie is nice to look at and the soundtrack is decent also, but the anticlimatic plot and storyline are rather disappointing.
B000957O82|5.0|This film is a perfect \\"date\\" or anniversary movie.  Will Smith is perfect as the date doctor who assists helpless other males find their perfect soulmate.  And it is clear from early on that Smith is not just helping these other guys \\"score.\\"  He is only interested in assisting them in finding \\"love.\\"  So with all his knowledge, we find that he has problems when he finally falls in love himself.  This film is cute, charming, touching -- all the things it should be.  I recommend it highly.  Also, I always thought that George Clooney was the new \\"Cary Grant,\\" and he may indeed be.  But Will Smith is another one.  He is absolutely perfect at the smooth, sophisticated banter.  I loved this movie.
B0006399FS|1.0|All the song in this album was so terrible when i first listen to. I throw this cd's away. You will regret if you buy this cd's b'coz all the song was so horrible!!!! I think most of the music lover will agree that this was a worst album for the year 2005. But how they can won the album of the year in grammy??? I'm so suprised that. U2 sucks n b***h!!!

B000002LTU|2.0|The last Miles Davis studio album is just another of his weak late works. For me, the good Miles Davis period ends with Bitches Brew, and after that he hasn't produced one good studio album. <br />  <br />At the end of the 60's, Jazz became more and more unpopular, and by trying to keep up, it tried to mix itself with any pop-culture influence which eventually popped up. The results were Fusion, electro-Jazz and all the kind of loungy stuff. In that period however, Jazz has lost its own identity, and it is most obvious if you listen to the late Miles Davis, e.g. Tutu and Doo Bop. They are really Miles' most conservative albums, because there is no experimentation whatsover (beside mixing Jazz with some electronics - sorry, thats not very innovative). Doo Bop is an album you put on when you want to have something light in the background, every song flows nicely, and every song sounds the same. Its like \\"DJ comes to studio, creates some lame beats, and Miles plays a little around it, always on mute\\". There is no real feel about it, no inspiration. <br /> <br />Well, its really sad that Miles became so mainstream-oriented at the end and thought for creating a new style of Jazz it is enough to collaborate with some successful pop-producers. Its so in contrast to his earlier approach were each new album was a musical revolution. Today, we know that electro-Jazz has pretty much vanished. We have put the 70/80/90 Jazz albums away, have almost forgotten them, while we still enjoy listening to \\"Kind of Blue\\", ESP, Miles Smiles. And fortunately, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland, Wayne Shorter,... have turned back to acustic Jazz and real musical experiments.

0671015206|4.0|this is not a formal book review; if you want that, look elsewhere. here are some sundry thoughts:    -fortunately, the book is not an ad nauseum repetition of the seven traits of wealth accumulators--that would be dull over a 250-page span. the book's multiple case presentations are not only interesting and varied, but they also illustrate the wealth-building and wealth-destroying habits of real people--instructive cues for your own behavior.    -the book is not a step-by-step blueprint for becoming wealthy; largely, the book sticks to pointing out the attitudes and habits that have worked for the successful, what's not worked for the unsuccessful.    -some have criticized what seems to be an excessive focus on the automobiles of the studied population. but this makes sense--being frugal or foolish in car purchases is often emblematic of one's approach to other forms of consumption.    -the authors keep unnecessarily convoluted PhD-speak to a minimum, in turn making this book a swift read.    -without saying as much, the authors use the concept of \\"economic outpatient care\\" to evoke aptly the notions of frailty and sickness on the part of financially needy adults. nice picture.    -toward the end of the book, there's an unseemly glimpse of the authors' politics. in retrospect (about a decade after publication), their fears seem misplaced.    -the authors interestingly excluded non-caucasian minorities from their interviews and other data, and it is unclear why. i'm sure census & IRS data from the eighties and nineties contained more than enough info in this regard. nonetheless, the lessons about having one's financial head in order are universal, whatever one's ethnic background, gender, marital status, or level of education, and that's why the book is worth a read. i'm going to pass the book to my teenage cousins when i've finished the last few pages.

1400034779|5.0|Mma Ramotswe is the perfect heroine in this charming book.  Blessed not with great height but with \\"ample girth,\\" she kills a crocodile with one superbly placed shot, she cuts a cobra in half, and she solves all sorts of intriguing mysteries.  All the while, we're treated to tidbits about the Great Questions of Life, such as whether Pumpkin gives one a reason for going on, or just many times per day Men think about Sex.<br /><br />Yes, Precious Ramotswe is the only detective in her detective agency, in Gaborone, Botswana.  And when she tells her devoted father than she's going to set up a detective agency, he dies on the spot!  But it all works out for the best in this wonderful book, which I highly recommend.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|amazing movie that is a must see, sad and depressing, it further reminds me of how greedy, corrupt and how awful this world is
6305263248|5.0|This is a superb espionage movie. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno do a wonderful job of playing rogue agents that are working for Irish mercenaries. When their team is double crossed on a heist they go after the one that grabbed the case. There are some incredible car chase scenes through Europe and the directing, cast, screenplay, camera work, and music is first rate. You truly feel like you are experiencing it with them. Wonderful job of immersing us in the espionage and counter-espionage spy business. I was surprised by the ending. The support cast really do a great job of filling in the plot and overall feel of the story. I hadn't seen this movie in years and mistakenly thought that it wasn't that good. After reading a couple reviews here and seeing such a great price I bought a copy. I am certainly glad I did because it is an excellent movie and the quality of the DVD is top notch. If you enjoyed \\"Mission Impossible\\", \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\", or \\"The Bourne Identity\\" you should love this. Personally this is my favorite Robert De Niro movie now. The funny thing is how this character role fits with his role in \\"Meet the Parents\\" and \\"Meet the Fokkers\\".
B000002G87|5.0|Eric Clapton goes toe-to-toe with Duane Allman.  Need I say more? By far this is EC's best post-Cream album.  Never mind the title track, which everyone on the planet knows.  You won't find a better version of \\"Key to the Highway\\" anywhere.  EC's version of \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" rates with the version done by Freddie King.  These two tunes are as good as Cream's cover of \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" from \\"Wheels of Fire.\\"  The other blues covers (\\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\") are stellar.  The cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" is so unlike the original you wouldn't know it was a Hendrix song.  Anyone who has the guts to cover Hendrix and do it well deserves high praise.  Sure, there's quite a few covers here, but there are some top-drawer originals as well.  \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\"?  There is not a better Clapton original anywhere (with the possible exception of \\"Badge\\").  The hidden gem on this CD is \\"Anyday.\\"  \\"Tell the Truth\\" is a very good mid-tempo jam with Duane Allman playing slide as if his life depended on it.  Then there's the aforementioned title track, which legendary producer Tom Dowd once described as \\"the national anthem.\\"  It doesn't get any better than this.  Put this CD on the shelf right next to your Cream collection.

B00061QJZI|5.0|Don't listen to the moron critics on this one.  This movie is straight-up fun the whole time around.  Will Ferrell and co. are hilarious and the story is soooo cool.  If you listen to the bad reviews, you WILL miss out on an awesome movie.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I've been a YES fan since \\"Roundabout.\\"  This video is my absolute favorite by the group.  Not only is the performance by the members superb, there's that talented orchestra with the members literally dancing in their seats. No stuffed shirts here. The mix between band and orchestra is wonderful.  YES's music has always needed orchestration (one hears it even without the strings). I don't believe there are any bettter musicians at their respective instruments than YES.  If you can buy only one YES video, this is the one to get. (Kudos to the conductor for allowing the orchestra to have some fun__when they weren't dancing, they got very serious about the music)
0790729350|4.0|I bought this DVD for Santana's Soul Sacrifice.  In my opinion, this is the highlight of the whole concert.  Michael Shrieve's drum solo is unbelievable.  Imagine 400,000 people dancing in a muddy field, all at once!  Crazy!  Santana stopped the show!  Ten Years After and The Who rocked the show too, and of course, Jimi Hendrix ripping on guitar.  I gave it 4 stars because there's too much talking.  Some talking parts are long and drag on and on.  They could've been replaced with more music.  Otherwise, a really good movie.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I purchased this CD thinking that it would have lullabies in both English and French.  I was disappointed to find that this is not the case.  There is one completely French song and one that is half French and half English.   <br /> <br />I use this CD to put my baby to sleep at night and the songs are peaceful and relaxing.  They are not commonly known lullaby's though so it is not easy to sing along with them as you rock your child to sleep.
B0000AKY7O|4.0|Beware: Welcome is definitely not Abraxas or Supernatural or Blues for Salvador for that matter.    I give it 4 stars only because I think some will be surprised as I was. But I do love it.    It was definitely a spiritual phase. It's not just celestial new age meets Maharishi, but also jazz and just enough guitar work and percussion to make you remember it's a Santana album.    My first reaction was surprise, because I expected Abraxas Santana.    There was Leon Thomas' throaty warbling which I didn't expect. The intruding yet welcome organ and keyboards, and hypnotic tones. Some sultry female vocalizings by Wendy Haas and Flora Purim. It wasn't that I didn't like it, I was just --- well surprised.    Eventually giving it a second listen. It has become one of my favorite Santana albums. One I go back to relax with. Great with a glass of wine and a warm fire.    I also bought Love Devotion Surrender which is jazzier with 2 John Coltrane 2 McLauglin tunes. Caravansari is bluesier. Each has its magnificent moments, but Welcome is more successful in combining these spiritual and jazz styles and makes it, as a whole, more memorable and satisfying if not inspirational.    It just sounds and feels more cohesive and lush like they finally got it right and reached a destination.
B0000024IE|5.0|\\"Fear Of A Black Planet\\" - The title alone is worth the money.Such a great undertaking in making this album and you here it from the first cut.So much texture from the interludes to songs, practically seemless.Mostly remembered for \\"Fight The Power\\" but at so many points of this album Chuck D drops an entire history course ear whooping without the listener realizing it.He had the fury of a poet, the urgency of a street reporter and the wisdom of a teacher.Its like listening to a rebel harnessing all of his frustration and anger into some sense and direction.Flavor Flav keeping pace with his yeaah boyeees gave the songs an audience almost without getting in the way.Hank Shocklee and Co. did a masterful job with the production and arangment of the loops,samples and instrumentation.Future producers for any music can listen and learn.My track highlights are as follows: <br />1)Welcome to The Terrordome <br />2)Brothers Gonna Work It Out <br />3)911 Is A Joke <br />4)Who Stole The Soul? <br />5)Fight The Power <br /> <br /> - Not in that order, just my favorites.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Like a countdown to a rocket launch,'Go' kicks off with  <br />Butch Warren's bass and Billy Higgins on cymbals,setting up some serious kick ass blowin' by Dexter Gordon on his classic 'Cheese Cake',  one of my all time favorite jazz numbers;my only complaint-as other reviewers have stated -is this classic cd's length-less than 40 minutes.In any case,Gordon considered 'Go' his best cd. <br /> <br />Tragically,soon after this cd was recorded in 1962,Sonny Clark,the great pianist on this album would die of a heroin od at 31.And in 1986,Gordon,who should've recieved the Oscar for his portrayal of Dale Turner,an expatriate tenor sax player in 'Round Midnight' was ripped off for the Oscar in 'Round Midnight.'
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This isn't Dilla's best work, far from it really. Had he made this album when healthy, knowing his work ethic, raw talent, and what he was capable of, I'm guessing this would've probably taken him about a week or two to complete. He'd made 5 unreleased beat tapes in 2005 averaging at about 30 tracks each, a large part of each being Donuts-esque instrumentals. Many of them being in my opinion just as good if not better than Donuts itself which I just think proves that he could churn these things out like they were nothing to him. What makes this album so interesting is the backstory on it.     Jay made a good majority of Donuts in the hospital while getting treatment for a slew of fatal diseases he'd been fighting for over four years. Death knocking at his door and was still more concerned with making music. He had a true love for his art and let nothing get in his way from creating it. Even when he should've been at home in bed trying to get better, he was out in a wheelchair touring all across the world. Just pure dedication in every sense of the word. He lived and died for his music.     I feel that certain samples and song titles used and just Jay's whole overall approach with Donuts proves that he knew he wasn't long for this world and that this was the album he wanted to release as his last goodbye. Titles like \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"Last Donut Of The Night\\", \\"Bye\\", \\"Time: The Donut Of The Heart\\", and so on. It seems almost every lyric sample used on this album he used as a voice to his final thoughts on his life and death. A few examples -    \\"Save me\\" - Workinonit    \\"You're gonna need me one day, you're gonna want me back in your arms\\" - Stop    \\"Wake up world / Time is running out\\" - Glazed    \\"There comes a time\\" - Time: The Donut Of The Heart    \\"People the time has come\\" - People    \\"My family tree, is my history / That's right I'll die here, with the world's most popular visionaries / There's a lot of sincere confusion about just what the doctor said / Too muchtoo soon\\" - Anti-American Graffiti    \\"It's alright, oh I'll get over it baby\\" - Dilla Says Go    \\"Just because I really love you\\" - U-Love    \\"Don't ever say\\" - Bye (the lyric and the song title put together turns into \\"Don't ever say bye\\")    \\"I give to you\\" - Last Donut Of The Night (again, combine the lyric with the song title and you get \\"Last donut I give to you\\" which leads into the final song of the album)    The list goes on, but I think the most eerie discovery I've made is the fact that the last track on the album, \\"Donuts (Intro)\\", was made with a sample of a song called \\"When I Die\\" by Motherlode. Using the lyrics \\"(When I die, I hope to be) the kind of man that you thought I'd be.\\" I think you need to hear some of the actual songs he sampled in order to get a full appreciation for what this album is and what he was trying to say with it in so few words.    Donuts' intro and outro have switched places which I could see as some sort of metaphor for current life ending -> afterlife beginning or something along those lines. Not to mention the end of the outro loops right into the intro when played back to back, coming \\"full circle\\" not unlike a Donut, hence the title of the album.    This might sound like a stretch, but I think \\"Donut\\" represents a clock, and that once it circles around and reaches its ending point, it starts anew, such as life. It's tough to put into words, but the song title \\"Time: The Donut Of The Heart\\" and the whole thing with the intro and outro is what brought me to this conclusion.    I also believe him putting 31 tracks on this album and releasing it on his 32nd birthday was no coincidence either. Meaning, maybe he didn't believe he was going to live to see 32, so he ended the album on 31, the age he thought he'd be concluding his life on.    This is all personal theory. Still, speculation or not, I think it's obvious and believe 100% that this isn't just a series of weird coincidences. Whatever it is, it's pretty mindblowing knowing what we know now and as a result, I can't help but get chills listening throughout the whole album. It's haunting and profound.    Now, onto the actual review -     First, while I like the fact that every song on here is short enough that they end before becoming dull and repetitive, several could stand to be just a bit longer. Great songs like \\"The New\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\" are the shortest tracks of the whole album, both coming in at just a little over a half a minute.     There's also this rather annoying siren noise that comes in and out every now and then randomly all throughout the album. While it's not a total mood killer, it definitely wasn't necessary.     And last and most importantly, the way it was put together seems a little sloppy. Obviously intentional, it'd just be nice if the songs blended better making a smooth transition from one to the next rather than end so abruptly. It leaves the album without much of a steady flow and at times can take you out of the moment.     Then by the same token, you can look at it from a totally opposite point of view and say that the unpredictable direction Donuts takes you is what makes it so interesting and fresh. It keeps you on your toes from beginning to end never knowing what to expect. I honestly can't decide if I'd rather have it smoothed out or not change a thing. It's unusual, but I like it.     Regarding my theory on the album's hidden meaning, perhaps Dilla ended these songs so unexpectedly as a metaphor to life and how it can suddenly be cut short at any given moment, maybe? I'm probably overthinking it too much now, but stranger things have happened.    Taking everything mentioned above into consideration, I can still look past it's minor imperfections and give Donuts a much deserved 5 stars. Again, not Dilla's best, but certainly his most meaningful. May he rest in peace.

Diane Lane and John Cusack are at their best in this humorous  romantic comedy that  you'll  want to watch again and again.

B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a beautiful and very sad film that visibly demonstrates  the effects of a suppressed and secret passion. Not only the two lovers suffer, but everyone with whom they become involved. The deliberately slow pace of the film mirrors the gradual unfolding of the passion between the two guys. Who cannot believe in and feel for Heath Ledger's character? The cinematography, cast and music all contribute to a staggering emotional effect. I will never forget this film.

B00006D295|5.0|This movie is so funny and responsible for some of the best times I ever had going to the movies in the 70's(at midnight). The film is so much fun, the music is amazing, and I cannot say enough about Tim Curry's performance. I wish kids today had something original like \\"Rocky Horror\\" to experience. It may not appeal to lst timers...who did not experience going to the movies with those Rocky want-to-be dressed-up audience members but anyone who loves camp and/or musicals should enjoy this. (If just to see what your parents were up to back then!)
B0000AM6K2|4.0|What a great album from the first track through the last.  I have at times played \\"Slaveship\\" over and over just to hear the ooooohhhs in the background.

If you like this one you'll also love Nashville.

So what if she had 5 Platinum albums(her sixth FLOPPED)(laughs), one number one single which she hasn't been able to match since, a technical Grammy(if it is not Album of the Year then we don't care, she lost Best New Artist to Christina Aguilera), has a freeloading deadbeat husband who just uses her for money. Today, she is losing all of her fans who used to worship her now scorn and ridicule her for her lying, hypocrisy and erratic behavior, she may have had big hits around the world but in America only has FOUR Top 10 singles which doesn't amount to a plate of frogs. Her fame in music has dwindled as her husband is stealing her money. Cranky said Britney has beauty and respect. Her looks are gone to Hell and her respect level was given the brush-off. Her recent scandal involving her ugly baby Sean Preston has killed her career!  <br />I hope she dies from a either a gunshot wound or electrocution!

Heffner's attempt to be a part of the fabric of our culture seems to be the best film version of Macbeth, however that is not saying much.  This is a film that desperately needs to be made again...Lady Macbeth does not give even a lackluster performance, Macbeth is stoic and doesn't give the character any depth.  Perhaps we could get a joint venture soon with Baz Luhrman and Kenneth Brannaugh.

B00005JNQS|4.0|Children's movies really deserve to be reviewed twice--the first time by movie critics when they first come out, and then later by parents who have to sit through multiple viewings of the film when it's released on DVD. Some movies--like \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"--stand the test of time. Others don't. <br /> <br />\\"Robots\\" is a film that received lukewarm reviews from theater critics. Now that I've seen the movie perhaps ten times with my kids, I can happily report that this is one of those films that stands up to repeated viewing. Robin Williams is fresh and funny, the plot is reasonably compelling, and there are always those little touches that keep you smiling. I recommend it for your home library.

If you can find it cheaper elsewhere, then by all means, but it is a must have for any true collection.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wow. I love (LOVE) the BBC miniseries, and I adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. I also detest Kiera Knightly. Consequently, I went to the theatre expecting to be disappointed. I stand (sit, actually) corrected in the most vehement manner. I never would have believed it possible, but this is better than the BBC version. Matthew Macfadyen is better (!!!) than Mr. Firth was, and I will be very disappointed if Ms. Knightly does not win the Best Actress Oscar. To think I would ever say that, especially after her insipid performance in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean!\\" But, quite frankly, she deserves all the praise she has garnered for her performance as Elizabeth. <br /> <br />Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet with a sympathy that was completely lacking in the BBC version, and he quickly became my favorite character. (I must stop comparing the two films. They really are apples and oranges, so to speak.) Rosamund Pike. Wow. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Jane. She will forever embody the roll for me. I know that every time I read the book from now on, I will see her in my mind's eye every time Jane speaks. But quite honestly, the real standout, the actor who completely made the film (for me, at least) was Mr. Macfadyen. I was disappointed the first time I saw him. The second time, I decided he was \\"not that bad.\\" By the end of the film (actually, by the time he proposes so horribly), I was completely in love with him (as Darcy, not as an actor), and wondered why on earth Lizzie would have refused his first proposal. Seriously. <br /> <br />The cinematography is also breathtaking, and the soundtrack is next on my CD purchasing list. After that, of course, I will be buying the DVD on February 28. I am so glad I don't have to wait for months!
B000000OSG|5.0|... just after Use Your Illusion part 1 that is. What puts this album just behind part 1 in my opinion is the fact that there are few throw away tracks. Namely 'So Fine' (mediocre), 'Don't Cry (Alt. Lyrics)' (pointless) and 'My World' (awful, Axl's utterly failed attempt at rap). Otherwise this album is  fantastic. It in fact has more standout tracks than UYI1: 'Civil War' (one of their best), 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door' (fantastic cover), 'Locomotive' (a nine minute juggernaut), 'Estranged' (a huanting and beautiful epic), etc. Everything else is quite good as well, the rocking 'You Could Be Mine', 'Shotgun Blues', 'Get in the Ring', 'Breakdown', Pretty Tied Up', all great. Like its predecessor this is album is quite varied and simply does not get old. All Guns fans should own this classic.
1574535676|5.0|My father gave me this CD and I have since purchased a few copies as gifts for others... It is a superb overview of time-saving, time management techniques by a guru of the industry.  The title may be strange, but the techniques are very useful to anyone who feels like they just don't have enough time each day to get everything accomplished that they set out to.  I encourage anyone in a professional job to consider this CD (or book).  Brian Tracy's approach has 21 tips and if you are able to implement just a few of them--you will see rapid results.  The CD/Book is very straight-forward and easy to follow. One of the better self-improvement items I have been exposed to and one that I have recommended to a number of professionals in both senior management and mid-level management roles.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Syncrhonicity, the last album released by the Police is also their best album. Each of their releases had been getting better and better, but this album is the crown jewel in their discography. The album is great from start to finish. Even the much maligned 'Mother' is entertaining. The song is obviously intended to be humorous so why so many people take such offense to it is beyond me... anyway. All of the other tracks on the first half are good but it is really when we get to the second half of the album that things take off: 'Synchronicity II', 'Every Breath You Take, 'King of Pain', 'Wrapped Around Your Finger' and 'Tea in the Sahara' are all classics and rank with the best songs of the 80's. What I particularly like about this album is its rather dark and melancholy atmosphere as well as its rich sound. In short this is THE essential Police album and one of the greatest pop/rock albums of the 80's. Highest recommendation.

0440237688|5.0|Reading the book, \\"The Giver\\", it sparked a different way of thinking for me and that's why I liked the book. Many of Lois Lowry's books reveal the same imagination and revelation, as does \\"The Giver\\". In a way, you can relate to many of the characters and their actions. Also it feels like you're there in the story with its in-depth detail, surrounded by these characters. It is an easy-to-read book and each page makes you want to turn it and read more. This book is so interesting that you'll want to read the words slowly and focus on the whole content or read it in one sitting so you don't have to get back to it and forget the storyline.   <br /> <br />

It's one of my favorite Madonna movies, and almost 20 years later, I still do not understand why this movie was bashed the way it was.  It's not a masterpiece but it's a fun romp with Madonna absolutely charming in a comedic role.  Her accent seems made up (is it Bronx?  Detroit?) but overall she's good in the role.  I think Madonna's best performances are her comedic ones -- Desperately Seeking Susan, Swept Away and this film.  She has great chemistry with Griffin Dunne, and the soundtrack is fun particularly if you love 80s dance music.  <br /> <br />Who's That Girl? is silly fun.  Give it a chance.  It's not Shanghai Surprise or The Next Best Thing.  But it's one of Madonna's few shining moments on screen, and further proof she could be a star comedienne.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|...but I don't feel that I've added a lot to my collection by purchasing this CD.  Unless I'm reading the lyric insert as I listen, I have trouble remembering which album I'm listening to!  That said, the title track is quite nice, and one that WILL probably make the jump to my iPod playlist.  The rest....we'll see.
0399226907|3.0|My daughter enjoyed this but only opted to read it 7 days in a row, not the record 121 held by Goodnight Moon. It's an enjoyable tale about the young caterpillar learning about life and growing to maturity as a butterfly. Along the way it learns junk food is bad. It has little holes in the pages representing eaten food and my daughter liked playing with her fingers.<br /><br />As we choose not to expose our daughter to junk food, the pictures of the candy other sweets was a little difficult for me as Rachael sometimes wants to know what it is, then she wants some. Still it provides the opportunity to teach about junk food and its consequences.<br /><br />Highly recommend the board book as it is less destructible then the paper version.
0679422714|5.0|The survival of all organizations depends on how quickly information moves across them.  Fast, you win; slow, you lose.  Any organization, political or corporate, that cannot translate the constantly falling cost of information into higher information velocity, is doomed.<br /><br />This excellent work shows how Mao raised information costs for everyone but himself, and brought information velocity to a dead stop, effectively shutting the door to China's future.  His methods were unspeakably brutal -- one Holocaust per quarter during the Great Leap Forward -- and his interest in those closest to him non existent.<br /><br />Editing:  Four Stars. The copy needs a little bit of help.  Some of the prose is a touch stilted.<br /><br />Copy Editing:  Five Stars.  Very clean.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I am a huge fan of the novel and the BBC production so I went into this movie not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by the cast and the new more youthful adaptation. I loved that this version dives a little deeper into the central relationship of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. My only complaint is that I wish they showed more of this relationship. Other than that, this is a lovely adaptation. The casting is good and the scenery is wonderful. Highly recommended for all Austen fans.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. The actors are great, specially for Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfellen. I think that the movie gave a totally new look at the story. Whenever I watch old or set in older times movies I always think, ah! That looks so fake! Oh, its boring! But with this movie, after a while, you get observed in it, and practically believe that it IS the 1800s. Everything has such a great, fresh look to it, unlike the 1995 BBC version, where its all chocolate boxes instead of real life settings. The portrayal of Mr. Darcy is perfect as Matthew Macfellen! He totally shows what my idea of Mr. Darcy was! Colin Firth (no offence), to me, seems more like not gay, but different from what Mr. Darcy really is.I always thought Mr. Darcy as a manly man, like Mcfellen. I LOVE the way he looks at Elizabeth and how he can show everything he is feeling with his eyes. I'm really happy that they decided to keep the characters to their Austen ages because I hate it when I watch movies and they show people like really old or really young. I think that Knightley did an awesome job as elizabeth, just like i imagened her. The 1995 BBC series Elizabeth totally doesn't fit my image of her.  <br />I love how the movie ended because I really liked the book but when I read it, I thought that the only thing it lacked was, exactly, a kiss. At least its better than Colin's 1800s wet t-shirt contest contestant scene!!  <br />Overall I LOVE this movie and this adaptation. Its greatly acted, great scenery, great costumes, and great portrayal of characters. Also it does a great job of adapting the book because the script really sticks to the book. A lot of people don't like the movie because its 2 hours long and they claim that it should be longer and that it cuts a lot off, but I think its great! You can watch it with your family, friends, etc. etc. If you really want to know everything, you should read the book instead of watching a chocolate box, wet t-shirt contest adaptation because you shouldn't be lazy and sit with a bowl of popcorn getting fat for 5 hours because you don't want to read the book! Read it! Also, the 2005 p&p is MUCH better than the sucky 1995. <br />Go watch and buy the Dvd for pride and prejudice!:)
0451526384|3.0|This is the second Jane Austen book I have read (the other being Pride and Prejudice), and I think I can see her immense appeal to her contemporary as well as modern audience. This is quite frankly well written happy tales - much like today's best sellers in pink dust jackets. Persuasion is very similar to Pride and Prejudice - the mood is the same, the excessive one-dimensional characters are the same and the message is quite similar. Still, the strength of the novel, apart from some splendid literary gymnastics, is how it does not take itself very seriously at all. It seems as if Austen simply wanted to write another \\"pretty little piece\\". Call it formulaic, if you like, but Austen knew her strength, as well as her audience.<br /><br />The heroine, Anne, is quite delightful - similar to Elizabeth Bennet in her thoughts and actions. The vain father figure, Sir Walter Eliot, is as comedic as her hypochondriac sister, Mary. The villain, however, is not as good as her other ones - he is bland and dreary, and not all that deliciously bad.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the story are the various observasions of female beauty. Of what does it consist - and how does it change through time? A woman's \\"years of dread\\" are still her thirties - if she is unmarried, that is. The lamentations over hideous crows feet, freckles, faded or coarse skin and the general loss of blom are in many ways just as prevalent in current female literature...<br /><br />Recommended as a sweet little treat - nothing more, but nothing less.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I only use my Swivel Sweeper to clean around the cat litter box and for small clean ups.  It's not like a heavy vacuum, but I didn't expect it to be.  As for the battery, I've had one for four or five months and have only had to recharge the battery once.  I just gave one to my daughter for her dorm room.  She couldn't use a vacuum because she's physically handicapped-they're just too heavy.  She loves it.  As for the price and shipping, I bought mine at Bed Bath & Beyond for about $30, with no shipping.

B000C3H4MC|1.0|I have a recent Yamaha 6760 SACD/DVD-A player and this disc locks it up hard--I have to unplug the player to reset it. (Another review here notes the same issue with an Onkyo player.)    I own dozens of DVD-A and SACD titles and I've never had an issue like this with another disc.    I've emailed Rhino twice in two weeks with no response yet.    UPDATE: The new DVD-Audio new release is out now. Get that. Great! Too bad it took years to fix this.
B00000K3UU|5.0|I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler. I am a huge fan of the Sprouse twins. I am a huge fan of Jon Stewart - lets face it, I'm a huge fan of everyone in this movie. But that doesn't make my review biased because the movie is what MADE me fans of them. <br /> <br />The story is a 30-something law-school graduate slacker named Sonny Koufax (Sandler) who finds a kid on his doorstep, Julian (Cole & Dylan Sprouse). Apparently the kid is his roommate's from a one-night fling 6 years ago. Perfect. His roommate Kevin (Jon Stewart) just left for China on business. <br /> <br />Realizing his girlfriend is about to leave him, Koufax gets an idea. He 'pretends' to adopt little Julian by calling himself the biological father, fooling social services. Too late, his girlfriend ain't coming back. Now he's stuck with the kid, so he tells social services to call him when a foster family gets lined up. <br /> <br />Over the weeks Koufax comes to genuinely love the little kid. When a foster family appears ready to take Julian (recently dubbed 'Frankenstein') away, Koufax is about to call it all off and make it permanent - but social services finds out he's not Kevin Gerrity. <br /> <br />Sonny ends up taking the whole thing to court. <br /> <br />I personally think this is Adam Sandler at his absolute best. It delivers the laughs that Sandler always promises, but also has a heartwarming, sentimental side - and amazingly, it doesn't take away from the comedy. <br /> <br />I can sum it all up in five words: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.
0671004107|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It really is first-rate science fiction, especially coming from a guy for whom writing science fiction wasn't his \\"day job\\", but I thought in some ways that it was an odd book for Carl Sagan to have written.    Sagan never made any bones about his atheism, at least in a functional sense, but this is a very \\"religious\\" book.  Consider the climax of the story (Spoiler Alert!) - five intrepid voyagers  traverse the universe and meet the Caretakers, while to all outward appearances their capsule never left the ground and the mission failed.  They can produce no tangible evidence of their journey except their own testimony regarding an experience shared only by the five of them.  Moreover, their account of their journey, and of wise and powerful beings across the universe, is taken as evidence of psychological distress.  Not terribly unlike a \\"conversion experience\\".    Or, consider the Caretakers themselves - ultra-wise, deeply moral, all-knowing, and powerful enough to manipulate galaxies.  They are not only super-intelligent, but also personal.  You don't get to see them as they really are (you couldn't handle that), but only as they deem it best to show themselves.  The impression slowly dawns that these alien beings are just . . . like . . . God.    But we know that Carl Sagan had little use for ideas of God.  Why, then, if God is a concept so unpalatable to Sagan's mind, does he find the idea of alien beings congenial - alien beings who are a pretty good first-order approximation of God?  If he can't accept the idea of God, why CAN he contemplate aliens who have so many of the same attributes as God?    Just curious.    All that being said, this is very good science fiction - it speculates in some very interesting directions, and the \\"moral\\" at the end ('love is what makes our lives bearable') brings the book to a warm conclusion.  I heartily recommend this book.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I remember when this movie came out my high school now i'm 19 so it wasn't long ago.but the great acting of Jake and the rest of the cast. this movie was very interesting the acting is great the storyline iS AMAZING and the great concept is that it is a mind screw movie. i defintly recommend the directors cut if you want the whole story line it is longer and more informative than the original. with the original you have to think and learn the movie yourself. the directors cut explains it in so much depth.  <br /> <br />if you really enjoy in depth characters who interact with each other very well and blend in you will love this. the only real weak points it has is that in some points it can drag but normally picks back up with something off the wall. <br /> <br />the visual effects are the last thing i'll cover the graphics are great and i don't want to give anything away but the graphics get you hooked they aren't that big in the movie but you'll fall in love with them when you see them nothing is cheesy and looks fake. this version also has a lot more comedy that will brighten the movie. so please i advise you watch this movie either version and you will love it.
0131479415|5.0|This is one of the books I carry around all the time to show to clients during my agile coaching work.  There's a lot of disagreement among the Agile community about how to estimate agile projects - ideal time? real time? points? NUTS(nebulous units of time)?  Arbitrary units like tomatoes?  Not content to work from his extensive experience alone, Mike did a lot of research into different estimation menthods before writing this book, and it shows.  Mike's given us a great even-handed discussion of the pros and cons of each approach in this book.   <br /> <br />For those who thing Agile development does no planning, Mike explains how planning on agile projects is actually a continuous activity.     <br /> <br />If you've got an agile team that's iterating well, but you're struggling with longer-range planning, this is the book to buy.   Mike's books are always readable, matter-of-fact, and easy to apply to real-world projects.

B00097DXZS|1.0|I rated this one quite generously.  That one star was awarded just to Santana's name because this music almost makes me feel cheated.  <br /> <br />Santana, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gutarists of all time.  Sure, there are the technical masters such as Malmsteen and Vai, but no one has the same feel as Carlos Santana.  It's just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this. <br /> <br />If you actually like this music, then have fun, jump off a bridge.  But if you agree that Santana is better than this, than check out anything else, the earlier the better, and definately go live.   <br /> <br />Overall, this album makes me wannt to throw up.  Santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage.  Don't buy it.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Really enjoy listening to this CD as 'chill out' music or as dinner background music when entertaining friends. Well worth the buy!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I would hate for anyone to miss out on such a great movie.  To say what happens right here in a review would be a crime.  Basically, the movie is about a photographer, L B Jeffries (James Stewart), who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg from his last assignment. To pass the time he turns to watching his neighbors.  This boring lifestyle is begining to make him sick, until something very unexpected happens. <br /> <br />After just watching Psycho and North by Northwest, Rear Window is definately my favorite.  Yes, Psycho has some unforgettable scenes and yes, North by Northwest is an exciting cross-country pursuit, but none of them have the same kind of suspense as Rear Window.  After all, \\"there is no terror in the bang, but in the anticipation of it\\" Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br />Following many of the usual Hitchcock themes, this movie turns out to be, objectively, his best.  If I had to recommend one movie to someoone who wanted to experience Hitchcock for the first time, this would be it. <br /> <br />Aside from the actual film, the picture has been restored very nicely, to make a great movie perfect.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|First and foremost, I have to say R.I.P. Dilla. I became a huge fan of Jay Dee's music a few years ago, and it's tragic that he died so young, when he had so much more to give. <br /> <br />If you love beats, production, djing, cop Donuts. This album, Donuts, represents what Dilla was all about--the music. The love of music, Dilla put Donuts together while he was in his hospital bed. Maybe he knew his time was short? <br /> <br />Many people have described this as a \\"hip hop album without mc's.\\" That's true, but it's also much more. This is a look into Dilla's mind. No mc's? No problem. It doesn't need mc's. These are more than just instrumentals for someone to rhyme over, they're songs in themselves. <br /> <br />With Donuts, Dilla has created a source of inspiration for dj's, producers, and hip hop heads for decades to come. To fully grasp its impact will take a lot (probably years) of careful listening of this album, and Jay Dee's next two albums \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Jay Love Japan.\\" (The man worked hard doing what he loved.) <br /> <br />My favorites: <br />THE SOULFUL TRACKS TOUCH ME THE MOST: Two Can Win, U-Love, Stop, Last Donut of the Night, Time: Donuts of the Heart, Donuts (Intro), One Eleven, Don't Cry,  Dilla Says Go, Walkinonit, and Waves; THE ABSTRACT: Gobstopper, Anti-American Graffiti, Mash, Lightworks, and The Factory.   <br /> <br />R.I.P. Dilla
B00000JG41|5.0|You Don't release an album like this and then just break up. I guess its kind of like the perfect ending to a screwed up movie. This album is so fantastic it cant be put into words.

1881273156|5.0|I read this with my wife on the recommendation of a good friend.  We have been married 34 years, and we wish we had read it earlier.  We already had a strong relationship, but the framework for communicating love that Chapman lays out would be very helpful at any stage. <br /> <br />Chapman explains what has been documented elsewhere (recently in National Geographic for one) that being \\"in love\\" is physiologically similar to being schizophrenic and is no basis for a lasting relationship (hello, Hollywood).  He postulates that most people want to have lasting loving relationships but are unaware that different people communicate and comprehend love differently.  He develops a model for communicating love based in theory and practice and illustrates it with delightful anecdotes from his practice. <br /> <br />We promptly bought a dozen copies and began giving them to friends and family, from our siblings long married to our children newly or about to be.
B000002H33|5.0|You've most likely seen all of the good reviews for this album.  To tell you the truth, this is probably one of the greatest albums ever created in all of Metal.  I would just like to comment on a few of the previous \\"bad\\" reviews of the CD. <br /> <br />1.  THERE IS ANOTHER MEANING TO THE WORD BATTERY.  Battery doesn't have to mean \\"energizer battery\\", it can also mean repeated strikes and attack.  Funny how the energizer battery comment was on a review that said, \\"i'm a genius\\" <br /> <br />2.  THE GUITAR PLAYING IS NOT BAD.  Plenty of people commented and mentioned that \\"the guitars sound like chainsaws\\"  FYI, to do that with a guitar take more skill than you think.  If you have ever tried an instrument (like guitar), you'll actually respect that. <br /> <br />3.  ST. ANGER IS NOT METALLICA!! <br /> <br />That's my opinion.  Follow some of the better reviews of the album.  They'll point you in the right direction.  :-)
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Yeah, everyone has their own opinion of Korn but for me Korn was all about raw in your face original music, with SERIOUS edge; and no pun intended but that said level they were truly untouchable. <br /> <br />So what the hell is this then?  <br /> <br />When I first listened to this album after the first 5 songs I had to shake myself out of it and put Take a Look in the Mirror on just to clear my head.  <br /> <br />I am sure this will grow on me a little and it already is in some respect because I still like to relax to old Nine Inch Nails albums, which I grew up on and the influence here is obvious; but this isn't the Korn that I know (or should I say knew?).   <br /> <br />There is still some rawness and edge on a few tracks but it is totally smothered by the overall softness and at times even what seems to be a more commercial or mainstream influence. But is this a surprise when collaborating with someone who has worked with Hillary Duff and Avril Lavigne? Hillary Duff??? God help us.  <br /> <br />Based on the collaboration alone I am really worried. I have seen countless bands (Tool, Silverchair, Pearl Jam) go down the toilet because of what seems to be a more commercial mainstream approach, more often than not influenced by outsiders trying to make music more commercially/radio friendly; and what happens? All the originality and edge which made their careers disappears and they die a slow death.   <br /> <br />The whole album is over influenced by outsiders and it is all too apparent. Are they totally lost without Head?    <br /> <br />I only hope that they can bounce back from this and can get back to some of their roots.  <br /> <br />Otherwise we will see them on the other side; because they are DEAD.
0195170776|5.0|I chanced upon this dictionary at a book store. After giving it a quick lookover, it seemed to be pretty good. Like any good dictionary, it explains the meaning in great detail and provides sentences indicating meaning in context.    The area where this dictionary excels is in clarifying nuances in meaning between the word looked up and other related words. I was looking for a dictionary for my high school bound daughter and this was what made me decide to buy this dictionary.     As an example, in the entry for \\"clarify\\", the entry talks about the subtle differences between the words clarify, construe, elucidate, explain, explicate, and interpret. It must also be mentioned that it *does not* do this for *all* word entries  -- only for some words.    As a bonus, the dictionary comes with a CD allowing you to install the dictionary on a PDA -- has versions for Palm and Windows mobile. I have loaded it into my Windows mobile Dell Axim x30 and it works well. The user interface is a little goofy but I got used to it soon. Keep in mind that you might need to have an external memory card to store the dictionary data.     Overall, I am very happy with the decision to buy this. Its a great value especially if you have a PDA.
B000024ZYP|5.0|So many beautiful and haunting passages throughout this recording and the deep source which this taps into is unmatched in any of Brahem's other works before or since.     The second piece \\"Kashf\\" is my personal favorite. \\"Kashf\\" the Arabic word meaning intuition, insight and discovery of unseen/unknown things, certainly transports one to a place they may never have visited before. And if this was all it would still be a worthwhile album, but there's so much more. The very next piece, deepens one's mood even further until the fourth where the Holland's double bass and Brahem's oud dance a musical duet. The lack of percussion is an important unifying thread through the tracks and allows the mind to fly and wander with the relaxed music.    This is music that can bring one to tears. No matter what you find in the reviews it's still indescribable and needs to be experienced. Unfortunately this trio of musicians hasn't recorded together again, which makes this even more special. A sublime recording of a very special synergy between the players and their instruments available for us to enjoy over and over.    Do yourself a favor, skip something else, and get this!    Enjoy.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes has always managed to bring a smile to my face whenever I read it. And that is a good enough reason to buy this set. It is sophisticated, cool and hilarious all at the same time. This is not a comic just for kids. <br /> <br />However, the box that holds the 3 volumes is a bit flimsy. But the fact that this is the 'complete' collection of calvin and hobbes is enough to off set that minor detail.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Who ever says the orchestra and the band don't go well together obviously doesn't know much. It's brilliant; the orchestra push Metallica's sound way past what they're capable of on their own. This album has real depth and will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand to attention. A must!
B000008H1W|5.0|OK, this is the Minstrel in the Gallery release to go after. Do not, I repeat do NOT buy the re-release with the bonus tracks. None of them do a thing but hurt this great release.<br /><br />Not only does this contain one of the group's best-written, best-known songs, Minstrel in the Gallery, but it's got much more. Be it Requiem (one of the finest acoustic songs in the band's catalogue), Cold Wind to Valhalla (a myth-influenced winner, at least in my book), or Baker St. Muse (One of their finest extended pieces), this album has some great music. Pick it up!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was actually a gift for my Dad but considering it is his ONLY DVD and he switches between Band of Brothers and the history channel I have seen it many times and even I love it - And I am not a fan of war or history.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Just to respond to a couple of earlier reviewers and correct a common misconception, Johnny Cash never served time in prison.  He spent the night in jail several times during his hooked-on-amphetamines period (pretty much the entire 1960's), but he was never convicted of a serious crime and never did any hard time. <br /> <br />Not that you would know it from the reception the hard-timers at Folsom Prison gave him - they certainly treated him as one of their own, from the sound of this great live recording which should be in anyone's collection of American music. <br /> <br />
B00005YUPO|5.0|My 4 month old baby loved this dvd. He likes the music and the moving toys. Pictures change in a slow motion that is comfortable for young babies. I found this dvd very good.
B0000549B0|5.0|Always a pleasure to watch James Stewart and Harvey.  This is a classic movie that anyone would love.  It is a funny movie.  Trouble is most of my friends have no idea what a pookah is.  and i see pookahs everywhere.  their loss.
0060543884|3.0|This is a book that has a lot of hype from how many people recommend it.  It is a very good story about a Shepard who is searching for his place in this world, however it leaves a lot to be desired in a spiritual aspect.  If your looking for something really deep in a spiritual sense this book may not be what you are seeking.
0553801503|3.0|This book was fairly mediocre. I enjoyed reading it, but found that the story really isn't advancing very fast. Martin focuses predominantly on the characters associated with King's Landing, which worked fine. However, there's not enough substance and pace, and the story line does not advance far enough in my opinion. <br /> <br />If you're on book 4, you gotta keep going. This series is one of my favourites, second only to the classic LOTR. This book, though, is the weakest one to date.
0375703764|2.0|I tried to read this novel from cover to cover, gave up after three hours and skipped around to what I hope were the good parts in the remainder of the book. The plot about the exploration of an apparently evil house that is larger on the inside than on the outside sounds interesting, but the disgusting details inside the plot itself, the mean and worthless characters, and the sheer weight of this deranged, non-linear, hodge-podge book combine to require more effort than I was willing to invest for the pay-off this work promised. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project are inaccurate and I feel are an effort to cash in by linking to what is a much better movie  than this is a book. Might've worked more if it had been presented less radically instead of in a format of notes, lists, diary entries, narratives, and scraps of paper.
B000000OUJ|5.0|One of my favourite albums of all time. Put simply a must have. <br />lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers.
1932100385|5.0|A serious and profound presentation of compelling and clear research, why the medical and drug establishment (and government) often fails us badly, and the most effective and practical way to delay, avoid, even treat major killer diseases. Throw away the fad diet books and get healthy. Totally doable for those who want good health and a compelling case for not stopping half way - which gets nothing close to half the benefits. I'm getting copies for each of my kids and the local library! Fscinating on many levels, clear, useful.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Based on the complaints about the lack of surround sound, I almost passed on this DVD. I'm glad I didn't. There is a DTS soundtrack. That stands for Digital Theater Sound, and it is not the same as AC3 (Dolby digital 5.1). Your DVD and Amp must be able to read and decode DTS for it to work. Most newer ones do, though I've got a 5 year old amp that does, too.  <br /> <br />That out of the way, this performance is great. I've seen Joe and the band in person twice (and keep checking his tour schedule hoping he'll get close), and this DVD captures the raw power of his voice and the sheer brilliance of his playing. I saw none of the \\"tension\\" between Joe and Eric that one reviewer found distracting, though I hate that he and the drummer have left.  <br /> <br />So get this DVD. It'll probably be the last of the original lineup.
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|Omly one person that reviewed this CD liked \\"Tainted Love\\" exclusively.  Another surprise in a list of surprises from others reaction to this CD.  I always wonder why their greatest hits packages only contain a few songs from this CD until I realized you would have to include the whole thing to satisfy fans.  Therefore it is much better to load the greatest hits packages with more obscure songs from other releases, highlights from less consistent CD's, along with unreleased songs, if possible.  Then fans can buy a greatest hits CD and this one and get a complete collection of Soft Cell's music, which stands with the best from any group.  Their magic comes in that their music takes you into their world and even though it is filled with depression and futility it is exciting when you observe it rather than experience it.  I can easily listen to this CD from beginning to end, but I do have a slightly different view of this CD, than others that reviewed it. I still love it to death, but to me \\"Sex Dwarf\\" is entertaining only because of the lyrics, and is, to me, the least musical song on the CD.  I also find \\"Secret Life\\" to be a highlight among a CD of highlights.  It is 3 in the afternoon now so I do have to get up sometime.  I better start drinking so I can get rid of this hangover and face the same miserable people I hangout with everyday.  A truly unique set of fun music.
B00005OM5L|4.0|Outstanding performance from 1996.  The quality of the music is perfect, and the visuals are pretty close to perfect.  Eric's vocals are quite strong throughout the show.  My only gripe is that he does not let loose with long guitar solos at the end of the songs like he should.  Too many short songs.  If you're one of the greatest guitarists of all time, isn't a live performance your chance to really let loose?  I don't understand it.  He needs to take a lesson from Mark Knopfler, the greatest live guitarist in rock history.  Eric has done it before, but he doesn't do it enough in this concert.  Still, this is a no brainer to own if you like Eric Clapton, just not his best effort.  Still the best effort he has on DVD to date.
0783226888|4.0|bruce willis and richard gere plus sidney poitior in the story of an hit-man out to kill someone in the u.s. and we don't know who. russiaian mob men are looking for payback after u.s. and russian police kill one of the mobs boys in russia. they hire the \\"jackel\\" a hit-man who no one has ever seen and ask him to do the job. willis is the killer and he looks mean and enjoys killing. gere is an i.r.a. killer in jail who also has seen the \\"jackel\\" and poitior is the f.b.i. man that is tracking the hit-man down. logic never gets in the way of the action as this movie pulls out all the stops to tell this story. i makes no sence at all but it is fun if you let it be. willis is ok , gere's accent slips as much as his acting and poitior is his fine acting self and he never lets his age keep him out of the action . not great but fun .
B00000294R|4.0|More than likely Big L wouldn't be notice today like he was when he was alive. Then again he could of been one of the most known rap artist if he was still alive, but we don't know and never will. By the way if you say this album is lame, then you must be death or very, very stupid.  <br /> <br />1. Put It On- A good way to start an album, this is going to be the best beat you get on the album too. (5/5) <br />2.MVP- An okay hook, Big L tells why he is MVP, this is the same beat from Biggie's \\"Big Poppa\\" (4/5)  <br />3.No Endz, No Skinz- Big L tells you if you don't have any money, then your not getting any p****. He made a video of this song by the way. (5/5) <br />4.8 Iz Enuff- good song with alot of people. (4/5)  <br />5.All Black- He's going to have your family at a funeral, in all black. (4/5)  <br />6.Danger Zone- The evil big L. (4/5)  <br />7.Street Struck- This is the only positive message Big L has.

6304602944|4.0|i liked this movie what can i say. it's silly never even close to being believeable but kurt russell is always great to me and he even makes stallone a little more fun to watch. as cpos set up and sent to prison for crime they didn't do they break out and hunt the bad guys down. noyhing new just more hummor and a young terri hatcher as stallone's sister and russell's love intrest. not earth shattering but a nice way to spend 97 min. of your time if you like action movies.
0440241588|4.0|John Grisham is, without question, a fine storyteller, and The Broker is a good story and a good read.   However, his many fans who love his novels of the legal profession and expect this one to follow form, will be a bit disappointed in this story of political intrigue.   This is NOT a page turner that you can't put down.
B00005JKG7|5.0|after the hit \\"halloween\\" john carpenter was giving a little more money and alowed to make this ghost story that works when it really shouldn't. he got a great cast and put them through the paces as the town of antino bay is ready for it's 100th birthday. known to all 100 years ago the town did something bad to get itself started and tonight that something is coming back to make it right. lots of great creepy things happen and if you like ghost stories you'll love this one. give it a chance.
B000002O5L|5.0|Hopefully \\"Full Moon Fever\\" will someday be considered one of the great rock 'n' roll albums of all time, because it is. There isn't one weak track. It's perfect: Great attitude, great songs, great humor. Petty is pretty much a can't-miss artist; if you like anything by him, you'll probably like everything by him. That having been said, if I'm off to the proverbial desert island and I can only take one of his records, it's gonna be this or \\"Wildflowers.\\" Man, I hope I never have to make that choice.
B000059HB7|5.0|i love john wayne and almost any movie he is in gets  5 stars from me but this one is great. waynes  and hawks answer to \\"high noon\\" in which they felt cast a bad light on the west and the hero , so we get this classic about an sheriff, his former side-kick now a drunk, a lame old man , and a hot head young gunman who go up against the town bad guy after the arest his brother for murder. the broyher sends gunmen after wayne and company and they learn that wayne and company are not pushovers. dean really is the star of this movie as the once great lawman, who because of a woman has turned to the bottle and is now finding a reason to climb out of it again. walter breenen is the old man and rick nelson is the young gunman and they along with anggie dickerson as waynes loveintrest!!! give this movie all the star power you could want. just sit back and enjoy this fine movie
0689878451|5.0|This book is the most adorable and heartwarming thing I've ever seen. I'm serious - my heart is literally warmer having read this. What else can I say? The world is truly a better place for having this book in people's homes.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|first they cast a black man as an undercover agent in the wild west where he would never be able to help as they would never let him in most places. remember this was before political correctiness or civil rights. then they turn one of the best villins on t.v. into a racist man missing most of his body. then they add state of the art f/x and think they have a great movie. it's pure trash and gets one star because you can't give no stars. a waste and you should see the t.v. show if you want to see this concept really work well. just not good at all, a mess.
0618526412|1.0|if you like books with a real good story line and that flows nicely, don't read this book. it is strictly about individual characters (every chapter = 1 out of 5 characters) and no story. i was on page 120 and there was still no storyline and i would find myself wondering why i was still reading it. if i can't discribe the book i am reading to anyone else than it isn't worth reading. i will admit i didn't finish it but instead skimmed the last part of the book. i really tried to finish it but couldn't. the only good thing was the why she described things.....you could really get a great mental picture of the characters and places. overall, don't read this book if you like great dramas or great stories.....it won't get you anywhere!!!
B000002UR7|5.0|The real strength behind Radiohead's debut, \\"Pablo honey\\", is the sincerity it sweats: Thom Yorke was in a real low-self esteem crisis when he wrote the lyrics for the songs. So, apart from the debuts from the Ramones and the Sex Pistols or albums such as Scott Walker's \\"Scott 4\\", Suede's \\"A new morning\\" or Wilco's \\"Summerteeth\\", you will never listen to anything as sincere and honest as Pablo Honey. <br /> <br />All the twelve tracks are filled with that late-teenage angst, kind of \\"I've graduated, now what?\\" feeling. So Thom is singing \\"why should I believe myself?\\" (\\"You\\"), \\"I'm playing with myself, and what do you care when the other men are far, far better\\" (\\"Thinking about you\\"), \\"I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray, but I'm better off dead\\" (\\"Prove yourself\\"). All penned with grunge distortion, not-so-well-recorded drums, and lots of guitar tension. <br /> <br />The best moments, though, are the tracks 8 and 11, \\"Vegetable\\" and \\"Lurgee\\". The first features the best Thom Yorke vocals so far, p*ssed off with the ones that don't believed the band. You listen to the song and see a vendetta desire in his eyes: \\"I worked hard, died hard (...) I spit on the hand that feeds me, I will not control myself\\". <br /> <br />And oh, \\"Lurgee\\". Have you ever been in a situation when you are with your lover and don't know what to do, and all you see is mess and confusion and breakdowns? Or have you ever been in a situation when your lover has gone and you feel a sigh of relief? So have been Thom, and he explains with a few, simple words: \\"I feel better now you're gone, I got better, I got strong\\". <br /> <br />Since then, Radiohead grew up and made better albums, such as \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\". But no one is as sincere, honest and true as \\"Pablo honey\\". As I consider sincerity the most remarkable, important feeling we can have, the album deserves five stars - you must have it.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I'm not a big fan of this tipe of music, but Andrew Rieu and his musicians put a lot of energy on the concerts that I had to buy this dvd... Totally recommended.
B000002QWD|5.0|This is the only Bing Crosby Christmas tape that you need to own.  All the songs are sung when Crosby was at his peak. You will not be disappointed, even if you do not generally gravitate toward Crosby or these old standards.
0920668364|5.0|This is a wonderful, sweet and silly book.  My son loved it as a child, but it was lost during multiple moves.  I just got him a hardcover edition for his 16th birthday...and NO I won't really go creep in his window and rock him.  Lighten up folks-- this is a CHILDREN'S book.  What my children and I liked best about this book (yes, they picked out the original) is that the mother not only loves her son, she LIKES him, no matter what.  That matters a lot to young people, especially teens.  Another favorite of theirs was the classic, \\"Goodnight Moon\\".
B000BT97AO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and it will become a movie that I will actually rewatch. On AOTS I heard it referred to as \\"The Neverending Story\\" for girls. That was actually a very good comparison. You have a young girl with problems in the normal world finding herself trapped in a surreal alternate world on a quest to stop the spreading darkness from destroying the world of light. <br /> <br />The special effects are strange. There not the cutting edge effects one is used to. The effects are very stylized and interesting. The effects are part of the story; the stoey is not an excused to have cool special effects like many movies. <br /> <br />You can definitely feel Neil Gaiman's presence in this movie, buit it is the Neil Gaiman of \\"Stardust,\\" \\"Anansi Boys,\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\" not the Neil Gaiman of \\"Sandman\\" or \\"American Gods.\\" This is a lighter entry.  <br /> <br />This movie hits a strange audience. It is a little old for most children yet a little light hearted for most adults. Despite this I did enjoy it and think it is an excellent movie that you could sit down and be able to watch with the whole family.
B000078DOH|5.0|The remastering takes a bit of the \\"mud\\" from the quality of the recording, leaving it with a little more tin than I remember. Flea's liner notes are a fun read, especially the mention of George Clinton in their ears. The addition of demo songs has always seemed a questionable practice, to me, but I guess some people like them. More value for your buck, you know. There's a reason they're \\"demo\\" and not the finished product-they don't sound as good.<br /><br />Otherwise, this album is about 15-years-old. If you haven't heard it by now, or formed your own opinion, then you really don't know much about the Chili Peppers. It far surpasses any of their current music. But if you're afraid and only like what's new and popular, you should avoid this little gem.<br /><br />[...]
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This is Madonnas best dance/electronica dance cds. <br />My favorite songs are: Hung Up,Push,Like it or not,Future Lovers, Isaac, and her latest single SORRY!
B00003CX97|5.0|When all is said and done \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" is simply one of the greatest films ever made. William Holden is superb in the role of the american escapee. Alec Guinness's role as the British P.O.W. Commanding Officer in a wonderful layered performance that I still am finding fascinating after multiple viewing. The screenplay tight and the characters are well developed. I will also add totally believable. David Lean's Direction and Photography is outstanding. This isn't a movie as much as an experience.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Many people say that this CD is one of SOAD's worst if not the worst CD they have put out. Whether it be because of its short length or its grittier sound, some people just dislike 'Steal This Album!'. I, however, find this to be one of my favorite SOAD albums. Actually, anything System puts out I lap up like a starved kitten.. but that aside; STA! is GOOD music. Lead singer Serj's once hard, agressive voice is sort of morphing into what we see in new albums. Serj's voice is amazing and I thank the high heavens that he was blessed with it. Daron also adds a hand in this album's vocalizing a bit more than he did in their debut or 'Toxicity'. This is a sort of transitional CD I think. But its still kiiick ass. When I first got this CD I listened to it constantly. My obsession only stopped when I purchased the first SOAD CD. Now, ON TO THE RATING! <br /> <br />1. Chic 'N Stu: One of SOAD's funnier, lighter, nevertheless catchy songs. About shameless and mindless advertising. Good meaning, looove Serj's rolling 'R' in the word 'pepperoni'. :) <br />10/10 <br /> <br />2. Innervision: I can see how this song is related to some hits like Toxicity.. But I really don't know. There is something about this song that rubs me the wrong way. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Bubbles: Reminds me of 'Bounce' from Toxicity. Once of the catchiest hard rock songs I've ever come across. It gets stuck in my head almost every day. I love the chorus and the way that the band can get so quiet and get to the point where Serj is basically whispering \\"Life is in a Bubble-Jungle...\\" then BAM. God! Amazing song. 11/10 <br /> <br />4. Boom!: A very straight forward song about how killing, wars, fighting.. all is really stupid, useless and we're only screwing ourselves. Music-wise, good song. Serj is more speaking than singing but its somewhat catchy. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Nguns: Good catchy song. Powerful guitar. Not one of the strongest on the album, but they can't all be winners. I think this song is somewhat about sex or prostitution? Whatever it is about, good song. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />6. A.D.D (American Dream Denial): This song has such a taste of ethnecity to its sound. I love that about SOAD. Serj's range is mindblowing... 9/10 <br /> <br />7. Mr. Jack: The first song that caught my ears on this album. It is truely amazing. The intro is so smooth and just chugs along. It reminds me of the music in a Playstation game called Spyro the Dragon actually. :) After the slow intro it picks up the pace for a little of Daron's signature pumping guitar riffs then slows down again only to speed up and so on and so on. Daron and Serj's voices blend beautifully here. I love the lyrics. I just want to sing along with them and I often do. Love the end. \\"Put your hands up! Get out of the car!\\" 1000/10 <br /> <br />8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O: To my knowledge this song has something to do with how Americans are amused by the slightest things, while there are REAL things going on like war and suffering where we just sit by and watch fireworks and stupid TV shows. This song is fast paced and powerful. Its gritty and then the chorus is a haunting chant of some sort. Amazing how they can mix to aspects together perfectly. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. 36: Everyone says that this sucks because its short. I like it because its a perfect interlude to 'Pictures'. I actually thought that it was part of 'Pictures' at first. Popping guitars, Serj's screams, deciding that you won't fall victim to society's evil, reformed, social system, all in forty-six seconds! Oooh. Compact goodness! 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Pictures: A SOAD funny song. \\"Can't you loook at my shaved ass?\\" xD Catchy, good to sway to, Serj sounds like Blue from Blue's Clues. Bah Bah Bah Bah! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />11. Highway Song: This song sort of blends into the last five. Its a good song with pretty melody. I love Serj and Daron's voices 'Ooooh'ing together. It makes me happy. Makes me want to look at something pretty. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. F*** the System: Catchy Jibberish. WARNING: Censored version of this song will be disapointing. It repeats the title quite alot. 9/10 <br /> <br />13. Ego Brain: Very well done. If these were B-sides, I think that this song wasn't on Toxicity because Aerials beat it out. But not by much. Very nice. Powerful chorus. I'm swaying just humming it! I love these kinds of songs. BEAUTIFUL! 11/10 <br /> <br />14. Thetawaves: Good prelude to Roulette. I didn't really like this song at first. The beginning is kind of bleh.. but then the chorus just flows down. The chorus is the highlight for sure. And the ending which transitions perfectly to Rouletter. One of the songs I belt out whenever I'm bored. 8.4/10 <br /> <br />15. Roulette: Acoustic guitar?! Soft vocals?! VIOLINS?! Is this a SOAD song we are talking about? Yes. And I damn good one as well. This is one of the songs on my CD that I listen to when I take a bath. Just shows that SOAD can do anything. God I love this band!! 10/10 <br /> <br />16. Streamline: Its okay. Sort of blends in. It is on the weaker spectrum of STA!. Bad way to end an album. But still better than anything any other band could put out. 7/10
0553213105|4.0|Pride and prejudice is a well written book, it is a little bit difficult to read, but if you like old fashioned books, you won't bother. Pride and prejudice is a book with a kind of messaje. you can learn something from it. i learned that it is not right to have a prejudice about someting or someone before knowing the facts. just as i al ready said i think its a great story which you can learn from. the book is easier to read if you have seen the movie before just as i have.

0062515675|5.0|Fantastic!!! that's what this book is. The  beauty of this is book is the principles are told in a conversational style rather than a direct \\"do this, do that\\" style. <br />The principles and their effects are beautifully told here. The power of having a goal, will to say no, willpower and the techniques to implement them are really good. <br /> <br />I thoroughly recommend this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only problem with this series is that you will loose way too much time watching it when you could be doing other things (such as eating, sleeping, reading, and well just living life in general). Seeing Serenity at the theater was my first exposure to this universe. Subsequently, I purchased the series and have been watching an episode every night since. I have already exhausted the entire series (for the third time)and there does not seem to be any end in sight.  <br />Some of the highlights are... <br /> <br />ARIEL-probably the most important episode as to the understanding of the charecter of River. Also seems to solidify her as part of the crew of Serenity.  <br /> <br />JAYNESTOWN- An important examination into the human understanding of heroes, symbols, and idols. Also it's just damn funny.  <br /> <br />Out of Gas- cried at the beginning, middle, and end (everytime).  <br /> <br />Objects in space- one of the best. \\"It is just an object. It doesn't mean what you think\\" <br /> <br />This is by no means an exaustive list, but only serves to give a brief example of what the series offers. If you are interested in questions of human understanding, and well, just feel like being entertained, then I strongly suggest this series, as well as the movie Serenity.  <br /> <br />
B00003TL18|5.0|This is a superb album. The kind that you want to keep listening to, and it stays fresh. I saw  the visual production first on PBS. Roy has a unique voice, and there are lots of musicians adding their talent as well. Do get this DVD.
B0002DB52M|5.0|At first I was diapointed by the stage settings. The slow pace at the onset added to my feeling of wasted money. By  chapter three I was totaly involved. The dialoge is very good. The acting is even better. The camera work is AAA+. This is a film that I highly recommend. Wow! What a Film!
B000AL730O|5.0|I've always had a grudge against \\"pretty-faced\\", \\"muzak-making\\" Paul McCartney, but this album has really opened me up to his music. Paul is playing the majority of the instruments on the album, which is truly impressive. The album is also diverse, with the pop driven 'Fine Line' to the Latin 'A Certain Softness.' His voice still sounds great, and the songwriting is very creative as well. ALthough I'll always prefer \\"Strawberry FIelds\\" to \\"Penny Lane\\"; or \\"Julia\\" to \\"I Will\\", this is a creative contemporary piece of excellent music.
0060764899|4.0|C.S. Lewis, the author, calls the book I have read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. This book is about 4 young children whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy who stumbles into a mysterious world called Narnia. This world is found in an old wardrobe in their house. How they discovered this pace was when Lucy and her other brothers and sisters were playing hide and go seek and Lucy decided to hide in this old wardrobe they had found. She stared to move back into it and she noticed that there was no back to it. She kept on moving farther and farther into the wardrobe and still she could not find the wall. She started to feel weird about this until she saw a light. She ran towards the light and it was actually a lamppost. She had also noticed that there was snow on the ground and that she was in the middle of a forest! She could not believe her own eyes. Then a creature that had a body of a man and a goat came up to her and it started to talk to her. It invited her to his home. His house was a cave but it had a fireplace and candles and stuff like that. The creature told Lucy all about Narnia. Then after the creature was done she had decided to return home. When she got back home threw the wardrobe she told her brothers and sisters. They did not believe her. She got upset because they all thought she was lying. Then Edmund went into the wardrobe to see if she was telling the truth. What did Edmund see? Was Narnia really there? Was Lucy making all this up? Here are just some questions that the book gives you and the only way to find out more about it is that you will just have to read it!  <br /> I liked The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a lot. I think this book was exciting to read because of how everything was so unique of what any other stuff I have read. I also liked it because there were fights in it. I could not really feel like I was in the book because some of the descriptions were not very clear as some other books I have read. Also the characters were not really that well detailed. The main conflict did interest me, even if I could not feel like I was not in the book, because I liked the idea of how some one was trying to take back his kingdom and I also liked it because there was a couple of really cool battles in it. I thought the characters did not seem that realistic because the author did not describe the characters as well because he pretty much just gave basic information about each one of them. I thought the books' ending was satisfying but the author seemed to me like he was trying to rush the ending. The ending didn't really make sense but besides that I think the book was good though. <br /> I think the author had a voice in a more little childish sort of voice. Like he would not give away the cool parts like heads being chopped off. The author did use a very large vocabulary but he did include monsters that I have never heard of like something called a wraith. I thought the author had absolutely no uniqueness to his writing but I think he made a very unique plot. Some unique characteristics of his writing is that he would say stuff like \\" I can not tell you any more of how these creatures looked like because they would be to hideous for the readers.\\"  I thought the dialogue in this book was okay compared to other books I have read. I think this book was more set to younger people, so that's why the dialogue is not very good to me because its it kind of immature to me. I think this author did a really good job with the plot but needs to work on more description, but over all I thought the book was very unique.  <br /> I think this book is an all right book. I think this book is more for younger people around 12 and younger. This book is a very easy read. Also this book is good for boys and girls. Finally I would rate this book an 8 out of 10. <br /> The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is a a pretty good book. I admit that I have read better books but this is a good book if you are looking for a easy and a pretty fast read. I personally think this book is more set for younger kids maybe around the age of 10. I liked this book because of how unique it was. It was unique because of all the different types of monsters it had like trolls, wraiths, goblins, centaurs, and much more. I also liked this book because it was really easy to understand. Finally I liked this book because it did have a few good fighting scenes like the battle with Peter against a wolf captain. This book deserves an 8 out of 10 because of how its really unique but it is also set for younger kids.     <br />
038572179X|4.0|Atonement is a gorgeous book; elegant, passionate, and involved. The pacing is used to great effect throughout to highlight intense emotional suspense. Where another writer might note that someone was shot, McEwan would describe the blades of grass the bullet flew past, the color of the sky, and the smell of smoke before the bullet actually got where it was going. In this respect the fact that the book was beautifully written didn't make it exactly enjoyable to read. There's a lot of uncomfortable squirming waiting for those figurative bullets to get where they're going. <br /> <br />Further engrossing is the depth to which he dives into the emotional lives of his characters. Each is drawn deep and clear, and no action that anyone in the book takes is left unexplained. Its easy to build a relationship with these people, easy to understand them. And when bad things happen it's very difficult, with only a few exceptions, to lay blame at anyone's feet. <br /> <br />To me that's both the strength and difficulty with this book. All the emotional weight the plot develops can't be easily formed into anger at anyone else, so it becomes, as the title implies, pervasive, heavy guilt. The difficulty is that McEwan uses this guilt to prod the reader a little, occasionally developing scenes that seem to be expressly designed to tug at the reader's sympathy without really connecting to the story.  <br /> <br />In short, McEwan has built a story of fully realized, fully engaging emotional strain, and then amplified it a little, creating moments of technicolor where the black and white would have told the whole story more honestly. <br />
0786852550|5.0|This is a terrific adventure for your young teenager! I recommend enjoying it together. <br /> <br />Nathanial, the young magician, will grab his imagination for sure. Struggling to be loved and taken seriously, he is full of promise and budding competence, but in his eagerness to show it, he gets in way over his head.  His relationship with his slave and savior djinni, Bartimaeus, has all the comedy and sniping antagonism you find in the typical buddy movie, but the djinni's wit and powers render this original. <br /> <br />One would think all the parentheticals in Bartimaeus' chapters would turn away younger readers, but I suspect it might even entice them to eagerly add footnotes to his reports -- though if done with the same acidic sarcasm, an ill-humored teacher might not grade appreciatively.
0060751967|5.0|How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire - the title is original and funny. The dialogue is hilarious; so much so that I bored my husband repeatedly reading it out loud. I read well silently, out loud, not so much. Kerrelyn Sparks has come up with some sideways ideas for the modern vampire, including how to save a broken fang. Never heard that one, nor the part about the dentist who can't stand blood. So naturally she winds up with a blood-sucking demon for a friend. Makes sense to me. There's a bit of spirituality in it - just that the vamp shows a sense of wanting to be right. A bit of an Angel take perhaps, but done very differently and not preachy or overwhelmingly dark. Fun with a bit of suspense, funny, and well written, just the way I like 'em!
B0009QBLA8|1.0|I unfortunately saw this film with two younger friends in about 1980 in a small theater in Eugene, Oregon. We hoped to better understand our culture through cinema and to critique the worldview of the film. It was a mistake, although well-meaning.<br /><br />The film is, as another friend of mine at the time said, nothing but \\"distilled ugliness.\\" There is no point to it, except perhaps to inject nihilism into the soul. Many scenes are outright hideous (I would never describe them to anyone) and the overall effect is oppressive, dark, and despairing. Having a a meal afterward with my young colleagues, we sensed this heaviness and had to pray to break the spell.<br /><br />Yes, some will say we missed all the artistic nuance, and so on. No, we were repelled by the repellent. If you want a creative encounter with the possibility of meaninglessness, then consider an early Igmar Bergman film, but not this.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|In \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" Fernando Mirelles has created what has come to be a rarity nowadays, a film that is both timely and absorbing. Narrated in flashbacks, it tells the story of a British Diplomat in Kenya who searches for the truth about the murder of his wife. During the process of his search, he not only discovers the ugly truth about her death but also the even uglier truth about the government-backed pharmaceutical companies who will stop at nothing to exploit the indigenous population, whom they have turned into human guinea pigs.<br /><br />Because of Mirelles' direction and the fine ensemble cast, the timeliness of the plot in no way detracts from the dramatic tension, which, although it mounts slowly, becomes gripping as the film builds towards its climax. Rachel Weisz, who has been deservedly nominated for an Oscar, plays an engaging Tessa, an outspoken activist who challenges the rather conventional  beliefs of Rafe Fiennes' Justin, who begins the film as a staunch member of the British diplomatic corps.  Fiennes' moving interpretation of Justin is both understated and subtly nuanced (a combination that probably guaranteed that he would be overlooked at Oscar time). Their performances are amply supported by a splendid cast of plausible criminals-in-high-places (The downfall of one of them at the end of the picture is not to be missed!).<br /><br />Perhaps the true stars of the film, however, are the people of Nairobi, who, along with the splendid cinematography of Kenya and Alberto Iglesias' haunting musical score, transform the film from a conventional thriller into an exceptional drama. Particurlarly moving are the scenes shot in Kebira, the impoverished favela, or \\"city within the city,\\" of Nairobi; and the scenes in which the women and children try to escape the murderous Janjueed horsemen in the Sudan also contribute a tragic realism to the film.<br /><br />Although it might be objected that the title of the film seems inappropriate for the character of Justin, who putters idly among his nasturtiums, when considered in light of Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" the title character of which decides to tend his own garden rather than engage the world, the name  \\"Constant Gardener\\" assumes a metaphorical status. It might connote the indifference of the world as we all \\"tend our own gardens\\" in spite of the ongoing tragedies in much of Africa today.utters idly among his nasturtiums, when considered in light of Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" the title character of which decides to tend his own garden rather than engage the world, the name  \\"Constant Gardener\\" assumes a metaphorical status.

B00005JO1P|4.0|Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs (\\"Cash: the Autobiography\\" and \\"The Man in Black\\"), \\"Walk the Line\\" becomes, in many ways, the \\"official\\" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of \\"Ray,\\" the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles.  The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing:  the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession.  Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives.  Yet, \\"Walk the Line, \\" written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic cliches thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.<br /><br />Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy.  Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character.  Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.<br /><br />We've seen a lot of this stuff before, but all credit to the actors, we don't mind watching it again.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|Whatever it was I liked about her first two albums, this album has it.<br /><br />Whatever it was I didn't like about Daybreaker, this album doesn't have it.<br /><br />It's different in style to Trailer Park and Central Reservation, but in impact, quality and listening pleasure, she's back on form.
B000007VCM|5.0|Love has to be the fastest transportation device to the farthest destination ever created by human being. The Egyptian recalls make me think that The Cult really come from a different world. This album is just a pure hour of emotion.

0060934719|5.0|Just when you thought you've read every last fantasy tale out there and heard every twist that you could hear you read Stardust.  There were parts of this book that I never before thought possible.  I love the unpredictibility aspects of this tale.  I highly recommend this book.  It is one of my favorites.  I heard a rumour that this is to become a movie, if Gaiman has anything to do with the movie production, than you can guarantee a classic is coming your way.  Be sure to read the book before the movie comes out.  Don't let this one pass you by!
B00005603H|4.0|American Beauty brings to the screen the story a middle-aged man who is not really in control of his life or his happiness, until he decides to finally take matters into his own hands.  That's when changes begin to take place, but as the saying goes, when it rains, it pours... <br />I have to admit I liked this movie much more the second time round. <br />Kevin Spacey and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the film does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.   <br />The only major setback is in relation to the hidden and not-so-hidden messages found throughout the movie. <br />In short, American Beauty is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
4789009637|5.0|I really liked this book. The conversations are ok&eacute;, vocabulary is great, as is the grammar explanation, and there are many excercising which teaches you the grammer gradually.<br /><br />What I really liked is the seperate Kanji section at the back of the book. It teaches you all the Kanji you need to know for the JLPT 4 and JLPT 3 (book II) exams. There is enough information given and there are very usefull reading excercises reinforcing not only the Kanji learned, but also incorporates the grammar learned that far.<br /><br />Use this book together with the CD's and workbook.
B00000JXV7|3.0|Forces of Nature, was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock among others. <br />The movie sheds light on a man en route to Savannah, Georgia, for his wedding.  On the way he meets a woman who will have a tremendous effect on him, changing his whole approach to life.  Thus, the trip ends up being quite \\"bumpy\\" and with quite a few unexpected \\"twists and turns...\\" <br />The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.  <br />The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are just about average.   <br />In addition, this movie does not seem to be Sandra Bullock's type of film.  Even though she is a wonderful actress, this role was not really for her and thus she is not that convincing in it. <br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really... <br />In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an awesome show.  I watched 2 episodes at a friends house, and the very next day I ordered both the series and movie.  It has great writing, intriguing characters who actually develop depth and personality as the show goes on.  If you like Sci-Fi but your looking for a bit of a twist on the same old thing, this you should definetly consider.  If you saw the movie \\"Serenity\\", you cannot judge this show by the movie spin off...the show is 10x better and if you give it a chance, you will definetly see that.

B00000JGHS|5.0|This movie will always remain in my heart forever. I still remember how I felt after watching this masterpiece at the theater the day it open. I was so fascinated by Demi Moore, it was a great of my life. There is not enough movies like that anymore done by Hollywood. Plenty of nude scenes, perverts who want to have sex with Demi and I understand them being a proud pervert.<br /><br />This movie belongs in every DVD collection in the world, if you don't have it, stop reading this comments and go buy it now. It include so many great scenes of Demi Moore dancing, her breast, her legs, her sexy buttom. It is incredible. The DVD includes a great surround sound so you can experience the movie at a hundred percent.<br /><br />A gem, masterpiece
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This film and this DVD presentation is so fantastic, as everything from Joss Whedon has been.  It never ceases to amaze me that with so many Sci-Fi fans, and fans of just plain great story telling, there are out there that don't know about Firefly.  The DVD iteself is full of everything I want as a film / TV fan, and I've used it to turn people onto this amazing world.  Not to push sales onto folks, but it's totally worth it to get both the film and TV show, you'll be looking for the other if you get one anyway. <br /> <br />It's simply that good.
B000089770|4.0|I just love this movie and it is an all time favorite of mine. It is a character driven movie and is mostly interesting dialogue between the characters. Harvey Kietel shines as Auggie the part owner of a small tobacco store in Brooklyn. The movie revolves around the characters that he encounters and that come in and out of his store on a daily basis. William Hurt is great as a broken and shattered writer. His scenes with Kietel are the highlights of the movie. The final scene 'Auggies Christmas Story' is touching and brilliant. Forrest Widaker also has a very big part in a subplot involving an accident that cost him his arm and the child that he never knew. Also Stockard Channing and Harvey have great scenes together including with a very young Ashley Judd in her first role (I think).<br /><br />There is a companion piece movie called Blue in the Face that has many of the same characters including Harvey Kietel as Auggie but its not as good and is more of a bunch of thrown together comedy skits and funny short little scenes but its worth watching to especially if you like Smoke but its no where near as good.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|My husband and friends walked out of the cinema and went back 5 days later to see this amazing movie again.  I have never been a country music fan nor indeed a Johnny Cash fan, but this movie made him come alive. Watching both sensational stars singing and acting their way through the life of John and June Carter Cash they became them.  It was an enjoyable and uplifting film.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Gerard Butler is reason enough to see this movie. Having only seen Gerard in one or two other roles I was surprised to see him in a musical. His voice talent is very good and for the first time you can't understand why Christine wont dump Raoul and leave with The Phantom. Gerard simply makes this version of The Phantom...well...Sexy, even when he is unmasked. And Christine is young and very well played. Her voice is beautiful. Very good movie, definately one to buy and keep as you will want to watch it again and again.
0375931007|4.0|This is a story told by Death.  An interesting point of view perhaps, but as it is set in Germany during World War II, perhaps it is entirely appropriate.  It is also a story of a young girl, who in spite of having a life that no one would wish on anyone, still manages to have glimpses of pleasure through many small things, including the few books that she manages to acquire (or shall we say, steal).<br /><br />It is interesting to see that it appears to be targeted to young adult readers - please don't be put off by this - it is very much an adult story about children who are doing their best to live a normal life in times of unspeakable horror.  It would also be a good way to introduce more mature readers to the history of the times.  But be warned, it is quite confrontational at times, and considering who the narrator is, very sad.<br /><br />To add extra punch to the story, it appears that it is the true story of the author's grandmother.  When you consider this, you realise how truly resilient we humans are, and how occasionally, and with a bit of luck, we can hold off death for a time.
B000002H6C|4.0|In my opinion, thus far this is Metallica's last great album it's no Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets but nonetheless a great one. When released in 1988, I was very disappointed and hardly gave it a chance. It took me years to really appreciate this album and realize how good it was; sadly, I do not see that happening with Load, Re-load or St. Anger that's like wasting plastic. You can tell they were changing their sound but the darkness and complexity that is Metallica was still there. However, this record needs to be re-mixed and remastered big time. I would have given it five stars but the production is dry and the bass is practically non-existent which is what initially turned me off the first time around. Nevertheless, the writing is so good it makes up for it. The first four records are a must own.

0786890754|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, so much so that I read it fairly quickly (for me anyway). It's a very easy read and a lot of fun.  A cute story, hadn't seen or heard of a similar plot, which makes it very original. Puts a happy spin on a normally sad & unfortunate situation.
0553573403|5.0|I just finished the best book -- George R. R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES.<br /><br />I can honestly say this is the first book I have read in a good long while that provided real surprises.  It provided moments where I laughed out loud, where I gasped in surprise -- and horror, and moments of true sorrow.<br /><br />It's a huge book at about 800 pages.  When I started, I kept thinking -- DAMN this book needs a dramatis personae in the front.  There are a lot of characters to keep up with.  I discovered after completing the book that there was an appendix at the back.<br /><br />I didn't need the reference sheet though.  After about four chapters, the characters were burned into my mind.<br /><br />I normally don't care for fantasy settings.  Other than Tolkein, I more or less steer away from the genre as I find most of it annoying and poorly written.  I had read a review before Christmas about the author and his latest book in the SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, of which A GAME OF THRONES is the first book.<br /><br />I was intrigued and picked it up.<br /><br />Beyond the issue of remembering all the characters and my general<br /><br />disdain for the sword and sorcery genre, I encountered another barrier to my enjoyment early on.  The story largely revolves around the children of a great lord, all of whom are under the age of fifteen.  As a rule, I despise reading about the heroic nature of children.<br /><br />I pushed right on through that.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br /><br />1. Magic is talked about, but seldom seen -- most characters don't believe in it and have never seen it.<br /><br />2. The narrative provides such a clear picture of the setting, I feel like I have summered at Winterfell and stood watch with my brothers in black atop the wall.<br /><br />3. I like the villains as much as I like the good guys.<br /><br />4. In true Shakespearean fashion, the protagonist has a fatal flaw.<br /><br />5. There are THREE MORE books in this series!<br /><br />A GAME OF THRONES is an expertly crafted novel about honor, politics, duty, and warfare.

068484267X|5.0|If not for his sense of humor, would Frank McCourt have survived his childhood? This is a wonderful memoir filled with love. Never does McCourt seem to blame or point fingers at his parents and their human failures. It reads more like a historical 'this is how it was for us' tone than whining.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|If they were to give an award for the most unique character in a movie, they'd have a difficult time choosing between this excellent cast. Didn't I sit next to these people at lunch during my high school years? I do recall wearing a ponytail on one side of my head, and I certainly was never 'in style'. I never made a big effort to be 'popular' and certainly succeeded at fading into the woodwork, so I suppose you could say I identified with the movie in a big way.<br /><br />These memorable characters made being a geek great and I love them for it. It has a surprise ending, so make sure you don't turn it off during what you think is the 'last scene'.

B00000ILDF|2.0|A sequel to director Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" was inevitable, of course. This traditional horror movie set in outer space simply made too darn much money for the studio to simply let it stand alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, he was determined to make a different movie rather than merely rehash the first. Thus, \\"Aliens\\" was adventurous, taking the story in new and exciting directions as an action-adventure yarn instead of another horror movie.<br /><br />Indeed, a number of critics feel \\"Aliens\\" is better than \\"Alien.\\"<br /><br />But now comes \\"Alien 3 \\" - as unnecessary a sequel to a major movie as we've seen in some time. First-time director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror movie, attempting existential overtones as they make the alien in this film Ripley's \\"Moby Dick.\\"<br /><br />But \\"Alien 3 \\" begins by changing the ending of its predecessor and knocking off nearly all the characters we cared about. Fans will recall that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the android Bishop escaped in a space ship at the end of \\"Aliens.\\" But this film begins with their being ejected from the ship and crash-landing on a prison planet, which kills all of them except Ripley!<br /><br />On this maximum-security planet, where lice infestation requires everyone to be bald, Ripley finds that the lone surviving monster is still with them. Soon, she's organizing the prisoners to be on the alert, but since there are no weapons of any kind on the entire planet, they wind up playing hide-and-seek with the creature for most of the movie.<br /><br />There are a lot of problems with this film, but the worst are its dreary, dark motif; the lack of sympathetic characters; the unpleasantness of the film's premise, which has Ripley eventually discovering she has a queen alien growing inside of her; and a lengthy chase sequence that is so dark, and edited so chaotically that it becomes confusing.<br /><br />Those looking for thrills or some enhancement to the first films will be very disappointed. Those looking for a headache will have come to the right place.<br /><br />And why is it \\"Alien 3 (i.e. cubed) \\" instead of simply \\"Alien 3\\" or \\"Alienz\\" or \\"Alien: One of Those Slobbering Monsters Survived After All\\"?

1558216847|5.0|The Long Walk is a very intense book.  Unimaginable to think that people could persevere through such extensive ordeals.  The physical hardships were astounding, but no greater than the mental aspects must have been.  It reads like a novel, but it conjures up mental images that are very real.  The writing is not flowery or easily flowing, but the content keeps you engrossed straight through.  Wonderful book.

No matter if you played the game or not, though, the movie really comes through with amazing animation, intense battles, and brilliant imagination that square labored into there second movie attempt. On the same note, no one will miss the lack of hollywood's influence that cuased the massive train wreckage of squares first movie named \\"spirits within\\".

B00005JNX0|3.0|Madagascar is a very funny movie. Seeing animals like a zebra, a giraffe and a lion behave like people is always funny, especially when voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer (who was funnier then I would expect). On Madagascar it's Sasha Baron Cohen (Ali G) who steals the show. <br /> <br />The animation is perfect, never have seen animals move in such a way. <br /> <br />Another very funny thing are references to other movies like Planet of the Apes, American Beauty and the Matrix. <br /> <br />The only thing is... the story is flimsy, there is really not that much happening. If you read other reviews you will have a very good understanding of the story, it's really sad that such great animation has been made for such a flimsy storyline.

I really doubt I will buy the next one.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|The name Donnie Darko turned me off. But, a friend insisted I watch it. My first viewing left me confused and depressed. I did not know what I had seen. Yet, it worked on me for several days to where I got up courage and watched it again. <br /> <br />Donnie Darko is a film that deals with all manner of existential issues. It does not spell out the answers because Richard Kelly wants each person to think about the film and draw his own conclusions. At least, I feel he does. <br /> <br />The best way to aproach this film is to realize that reality is bent creatively to express ideas that cannot be expressed any other way. Donnie Darko is a Christ figure whose sacrifice allows those he loves and even those he does not know to either redeem themselves or have a chance to live a life without tragedy dogging their footsteps. And, while one would think that as Donnie reverses time there would be no recollection on the part of those whose lives have been altered through his actions, the last scene is of the two people he loved the most waving in tentative recognition of who they are and what they know. And, as we see the small neighborhood boy who explains what has happened wave to Donnie's mother, who is to say this is not Donnie reincarnated in another, happier life? <br /> <br />This is a thought provoking movie that is not for everyone. It is beautiful and sad and gloriously uplifting all at the same time. It is a life experience, not just a video experience.
B000AL730Y|4.0|Paul McCartney's latest album Chaos and Creation In the Backyard seemed to fall on deaf ears. In fact, it seemed like the only people that bought it were people on this site. When I found out that Sir Paul was nominated for a Grammy because of this album, I shrugged it off by saying, \\"Ah, they always throw a 60+ legend in the running for good measure.\\" But after the album WON the award, I decided to check out the album to see if it was really worthy of it. And it is.<br /><br />Things start out pretty okay, though, with \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"How Kind of You\\", two songs that other reviewers like but I personally couldn't get into. But that's not too bad because the rest of the album is quality. Paul went back to being a one-man band for the most part, and since he's still quite good at what he does, he can still impress with tracks like \\"Friends to Go\\" and my favorite, \\"English Tea\\".<br /><br />But if you REALLY want to experience some smooth sailing, check out tracks 8-11 (\\"A Certain Softness\\", \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\", \\"Follow Me\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\") because those are the songs that you can easily lie back and enjoy. It's not that you can't enjoy the other songs, though. While there ain't much chaos on this album, Sir Paul's creativity is still ever-present, and it helps you understand why he keeps taking those awards home.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B000BC8STM|4.0|I originally bought the VHS version of this 1990 concert and I really like it. That version released in 1992 was cutted to 13 songs, leaving behind hits such as \\"JUST LIKE JESSE JAMES\\" or \\"HEART OF STONE\\". Now this re-release on DVD is loaded with special features such as an alternative opening, a big blooper from a concert of this tour that started and Cher's microphone wasn't working, a TV Commercial promoting the the tour, a backstage of home movies with Cher's commentary (Cher makes some comentaries throughout the development of the DVD), a clip from \\"HEART OF STONE\\" (song) with a personal camera, photo gallery and a cut from footage of Cher's crew backstage. Next to this extras you can find the tracks \\"TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS\\", \\"HOLD ON\\", \\"MANY RIVERS TO CROSS\\" and \\"TOUGHER THAN THE REST\\" with multi-angles of your choice. What I find ridiculous is that on the VHS version this songs were on the concert on its part of the show but now they appear as speacial features. And well I still wonder why they didn't release the WHOLE show without cutting it to just 13 songs. Well I believe that we still have to wait for that version. <br />Other than this, I can say that the show is really good and even tough the production isn't as her \\"Believe Tour\\" or as the \\"Farewell Tour\\",you can enjoy hits such as \\"IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME\\", \\"I FOUND SOMEONE\\", \\"WE ALL SLEEP ALONE\\" between others and Cher was at her best. If it wasn't for all the cuts, I would've rated it with 5 stars.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Hmm....Where exactly is this film aimed at? Its a GREAT movie, I loved it. But what type of movie goer would enjoy this? I guess me. A drama, that is quite hilarous, and maybe a little inappropriate funny sometimes. And then ends with a terribly sad ending. Leaving you with the feeling. What kind of movie did I exactly just watch? This movie you either LOVE, or HATE. You can't be in between. I loved it.
B0009OAVHY|5.0|one of the best prog rock albums of all time,  execution and composition wise. Incredibly deep, ghostly record. It grows on you. Be warned - it is not an easy soundscape.<br />Robert fripp plays guitar in a few tracks and lays a killer one take solo.<br /><br />The sound is cleanly remastered. enjoy this majestic ride.<br />The japanese replica does not include all the info and pictures in the booklet that the jewel case Emi version.  Both share the remastered audio and extra tracks.<br />Follow this one with H to HE, still life, Godbluff, The least we can do, The quiet zone and Trisector. Avoid Present.<br /><br />From Peter Hammil solo get The Silent Corner and the empty stage, which some call Pawn hearts 2, Fireships, Everyone you hold, for starters.  Also the rare Peel sessions is awesome.
B000BT97AO|3.0|When Neil Gaiman got the offer to do Mirrormask he probably should have said no. Not only would it have saved him a ton of work but it would have also spared us viewers the grief of wasting our time. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Conisdering the fact that Neil Gaiman wrote it, I was hoping for something as wonderful and profound as Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Mirrormask is neither of these and ends up being one of those films that shows a lot of promise but falls  short of its potential.    The story is about a teenage girl named Helena, who spends all day drawing a fantasy world and wishes she could escape working her dad's crappy circus in order to have something real. (Given the lack of talent the circus has, I bet I'd want to leave too). Things change when her  mother soon becomes gravely ill, requiring an operation that has a high chance of fatality. With her mothers life in balance she then slips into the dream world she created, in order to partake in a special quest. In this world the Queen of Darkness' daughter (who looks exactly like Helena) has used the Mirrormask to switch places with Helena so that she can live in the real world while Helena remains stuck in the dreamworld.  By looking through windows, she's the \\"imposter\\" argue with her father, grow more violent, take up smoking and sex,  and even begins destroying everything the real Helena finds dear. She must therefore find the mask in order to switch back and restore the balance of power to  the kingdom before its too late.     The climax comes when Helena loses and we realize that the \\"imposter\\" is in fact the real Helena or  what she's destined to become after her mother her mother dies. It felt emotional to see her standing in the sunset, her drawings destroyed along with her old self, until they bring back the idea of Helena switching again, which spoils everything and everyone becomes happy and cheery all over again.      Besides the confusing and somewhat awkward storyline, Ifound the visuals to be dull and disappointing. It was remarkable to see how much they could get done on a shoe string budget but most of the time it felt like I was watching people who were stuck in a cheap video game. Characters in the real world also play their counterparts in the dreamworld, just like Wizard of Oz. Only the costumes are less inspiring with masks made out of papermache and tin foil which really reflects the constraints of a low budget film. The only good bits are bits of witty dialogue and humor that only Gaiman can provide, while the rest is forgetable and ends up being a terrible bore.    So, if you're a Gaiman fan, go see it but otherwise it's one of those films that's best left on the shelf.
B0007M22TI|5.0|When I first heard these women sing, I cried. It is so beautiful, they sound like angels singing. When my family heard the music they all wanted the DVD too!
0783231202|5.0|The story line was very moving. Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman are always fantastic in any movie they do. It is well worth the price and well worth the time to watch!
B00005JNQS|5.0|We'd got this movie on pay-per-view and our 3 year old loved it so much that I got the video for her.  it's a favourite of everyone in the family - we watch it over and over again almost everyday - and still enjoy it each and every time!
B0009UC7H0|3.0|\\"Sahara\\" is an Indiana Jones/James Bond hybrid that should be appreciated by fans of, say, \\"National Treasure\\" and \\"The Mummy\\" (1999), though it's not quite as good as either of those films.<br /><br />I was hoping it would be closer to the Clive Cussler novel, but the main elements of the story are there. Matthew McConaughey makes a decent enough Dirk Pitt (Cussler's hero in his book series), although I envisioned him with brouder shoulders and facial features more akin to Charles Bronson. Steve Zahn doesn't physically look like his sidekick Al Giordino (who is supposed to resemble a human bulldozer), but I enjoyed Zahn in the role. Penelope Cruz is also enjoyable as the W.H.O doctor.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for desert-adventure flicks (e.g. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Flight of the Phoenix,\\" \\"The Mummy,\\" \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" etc.) and so really enjoyed the great desert scenery (from locations in Morocco and Spain).<br /><br />So why only 3 Stars? Mainly because the flick doesn't match the greatness of the novel, but also because of the many implausibilities (e.g. the escape from the pick-up truck, the absurd entrance into the desert facility, the soccer ball incident, just to name a few). In other words, the film often has a highly unrealisitic tone. Still, I enjoyed the fun, upbeat spirit of \\"Sahara,\\" similar to Indiana Jones or the 70's/early 80's James bond flicks.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book it would be more like a 3.5 or 4 Star film.
0375701427|2.0|Let's cut to the chase: this novel is grindingly tedious, despite disappearing Reviewer Maitland's protestations to the contrary. By page 150, you'll have a headache.  I liked The Plot Against America a lot, and came to American Pastoral curious and highly receptive.  But I'm sorry, this novel, after opening promisingly, came thudding to a near halt. (Reviewer PS, June 28. 2005, on this point, is required reading.) My wife needed to revive me with smelling salts about a third of the way through, and I promised her I'd give the book up despite a masochistic compulsion to complete it. Reviewer Maitland excoriated me in a prior, condescending review (since withdrawn, suspicously) for calling Roth \\"prolix,\\" but Roth is \\"prolix,\\" he needs an editor, but not as desperately as Reviewer Maitland does.
B00004X10B|4.0|Have been able to my Canon 20D, 70-300mm lens,Canon Elan,70-280mm lens, a 50mm lens, 580 and 430 flashes, Turbo Z,Epson P2000, all of chargers into the main compartments. Multiple cables, extra batteries, manuals, cleaning gear, and everything else required for a shoot. Love the room and all the little small pouches to stash stuff in. Only minor complaint is the number of zippers and buckles needed to access main bag. But I am anal and always zip and snap them and will never pick my bag up and have all fall out. Price was unreal. Buy it.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie and, in fact, did not even finsh it. If your idea of romance is being disappointed to find one man entertaining another woman, driving across town, and hopping into bed with a different man -- well, I would feel sorry for you. Yet that is what our heroine deems a good day. <br /> <br />Also, John Cusack's performance was lacking in energy. Diane Lane's role was too similar to under the Tuscan Sun, and this movie does not compare favorably to that. Do yourself a favor and watch You've Got Mail again.
B000002BQK|5.0|How is it possible that when you think an artist is at their best, they can come up with the goods again?  This is how I felt about Mariah back then.  This is superb.  I don't know why I'm always surprised, but I like each cd of hers better and better. <br />This is choc-full ballads again and fun remixes.  While Honey isn't my favourite song of hers, the remix at the end (the Def Club Mix) is amazing.  It's better than the original.  Butterfly, Close My Eyes, Whenever You Call and My All are the standout songs here and each are amazing.  My All is one of my all time favourite songs out of her lengthy catalogue.  If you love her talented voice and writing, then this cd is for you.  It was the last good album for a while until last years release came out.  Really good for ballad fans too.  I wish she'd go back to this style of music.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I made the mistake of buying two \\"1400 mAH\\"-rated knockoffs when I bought my PowerShot Pro1.  Both knockoffs TOGETHER don't equal the capacity of the Canon original!  Also, they won't hold a charge during storage; the Canon will.  So spend the bucks and get a battery you can depend on!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|and it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture! How could they nominate Hustle & Flow and Munich, while leaving this film (praised by almost everyone who has seen it) in the dust. Joaquin Phoenix is very convincing as Johnny Cash in performance and vocals, and Reese Witherspoon steals the show as June Carter. Reese has got the Oscar, but Joaquin has a much tougher crowd of actors to deal with. I am so glad they aren't making us wait any more months for this DVD. It just left theater and we can buy it in less than two weeks. Yipee!
B00004T0US|3.0|It goes without saying that in the legacy of rock music, Elvis is among the most important, and that most important in this case does not mean most consistent.  When treating Elvis' catalog for remastering, I can see why RCA would not consider it practical to take Sony's approach and remaster every LP Elvis released as a single album, single disc release.  On the other hand, the sloppy treatment rendered on Elvis' catalog is unforgivable, no matter how wildly varied these albums are.  There are still dozens, if not hundreds, of throwaway compilations on the market, and now to further the problem, RCA is screwing with Elvis' original albums.  The sequencing and tracklist of ON STAGE for instance, is a remastering of the original album with bonus tracks interspersed, and a medley replacing the original version of a song - and is for all intents and purposes a new CD.  What RCA has done to MOODY BLUE amounts to the same damage.    MOODY BLUE isn't a masterpiece, and its history among Elvis fans is very divisble - but in its original form it was a really good record, featuring some excellent performances.  The original album was made up of 3 tour tracks, 6 Graceland sessions, and a live cut from his 1974 live in Memphis album.  \\"Unchained Melody\\" is a more theatrical cut than a straight performance, but Elvis handles the song well.  His two Olivia Newton-John covers \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\" and 1974 \\"Let Me Be There\\" are well-done.  While some reviewers have noted the songs sound alike, that was why they worked as hits for Olivia as \\"If You Love Me\\" followed \\"Let Me Be There\\" up the charts; both written by John Rostill and have a similar style.  Both are good songs, in particular I like Elvis' loose take on \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\".  \\"Little Darlin'\\" isn't much of a performance though.  The Graceland sessions include two excellent country classics \\"He'll Have To Go\\" (Jim Reeves) and \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\" (George Jones), in particular \\"She Thinks I StillCare\\" is a standout.  The title track was Elvis' last #1, topped the country charts, and is a favorite, though one can detect a slight disco flavoring to the song.  \\"Way Down\\" was a smart uptempo rock song, and the cover of \\"Pledging My Love\\" is beautiful.  Though Elvis didn't intend it \\"It's Easy For You\\" was a beautifully sad note to close his last album.    Given that MOODY BLUE was my first Elvis record (child of the 1980s) I am especially fond of it, which makes RCAs remastering decisions even more atrocious.  Whether or not the record is patchwork, which it is, there's a certain historical/artistic sense that is lost by the reckless tampering with the album's content.  For this edition, RCA cut \\"Let Me Be There\\" which closed side one, and added the entirety of FROM ELVIS PRESLEY BOULEVARD IN MEMPHIS after \\"It's Easy For You,\\" which damages the effect.  While there are some good songs on that album, \\"For The Heart,\\" \\"Hurt,\\" \\"The Last Farewell,\\" it neither works well with MOODY BLUE, nor does it make any sense to tag another album on as \\"Bonus Tracks.\\"    This may be a purists' review, but RCA does Elvis fans a disservice by reorganizing a catalog that has stood for over thirty years.  Its time for the label to show some artistic respect for Elvis' recorded achievements, aside from the hits.  Why not remaster these albums (completely) and sell two-as-ones, keep them intact and identified as different albums.  Rather than a revamped ON STAGE offer LIVE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL and the original ON STAGE.  Offer BACK IN MEMPHIS alongside FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS.  Rather than restructure the MOODY BLUE album and attempt to pass off a different record as bonus tracks, fix the errors (the missing \\"Let Me Be There\\") and sell them as one set.  This allows fans to appropriately build their Elvis libraries, and treats his catalog with some measure of respect.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is just one of those albums that defies description. Much like Led Zeppelin's \\"IV,\\" Public Enemy's \\"Nation of Millions,\\" or Johnny Cash's \\"At Folsom Prison,\\" the Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" was THAT album. The one that when you hear it for the first time, you never forget the experience. I am almost afraid to write this review, in fear of cheapening the record it lauds, but I will do my best to stay reverent. <br /> <br />Opening with the drum-and-guitar-driven Come Together, the album transitions into George Harrison's Something, a beautiful ode to stolen love (the subject of the song, Patti Boyd, inspired Eric Clapton to write Layla).  <br /> <br />The album's silly side comes through on the 3rd through 5th tracks, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Oh! Darling, & Octopus's Garden. The trio of songs seem out of place when compared to the rest of the record, but somehow, it all just seems to fit.  <br /> <br />The next track is a towering opus: Lennon's obsessed love song to Yoko, I Want You (She's So Heavy). With elements of bluesy metal, as well as the nearly 8-minute length, this was clearly a sound taken from the work of bands such as Cream and Hendrix. <br /> <br />The album softens with Here Comes the Sun, and moves into the band's trademark psychedelia with Because (little known fact, the song is essentially the chord progression of Moonlight Sonata in reverse). <br /> <br />Paul then inserts his sardonic humor with You Never Give Me Your Money,  before launching into the seven-song mini-suite: Sun King, Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, The End, and, almost as an afterthought, the 23-second Her Majesty. This operetta is almost as famous as the album's cover, and is as diverse in its 12.5 minute span as the Beatles were in their entire career. <br /> <br />The Beatles never worked together again after this session, and honestly it is almost as though they knew from the start that reunion was impossible. They poured every part of themselves into the album, and in return, produced a creation seminal to music as a whole.
6305910340|4.0|Probably the only available good chess movie. (There are a bunch on other sports but not on chess) <br />Worth watching if you like chess, atleast once.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After seeing the movie I bought the DVD collection of the TV series to watch in our new home theater.  The best writing I have ever seen in any TV series.  My wife commented on how good the special effects were.  You couldn't tell the difference between the TV show and the movie. <br />Highly reccomended by anyone how likes a good story.  Not just for the hardcore SF fan. <br />After you have watched the whole series watch the movie again.  A lot of things take on a new perspective.
B00007LTIC|4.0|With a first listen to Going for the one, you enter a very very strange era of Yes. The Going for the One-Tormato-Drama era was a very conflicted age. You can see the different musical ideas of the times and the people. You get glimpses of what will be the 80's, in that Yes began writing what the common man call \\"songs\\", rather than sprawling epics. This is evident from the first, well, 4 songs. Then you get another Yes epic, but this also shows a different direction from previous Yes epics (close to the edge, The gates of delirium), and seems to be more in the vain of \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\".  <br /> <br />So what do you get on this album? Well, at first, you get Jon Anderson sounding like a Young Micheal Jackson infront of a standard guitar rock riff. This was probably Steve Howe begining his Asia guitar style. I personally can't stand this song, and i just skip it. <br /> <br />Next comes Turn of the Century. This is a fantastic slow Yes song, with beautiful musicianship and lyrics and vocals. Just an all around good song. Following Turn, you get Parrallels. If yes wanted to start the album with a rocker, they should have used this and skipped Going for the one. This is a fantastic song that demonstrates the colabrative effort between Rick Wakeman and the rest of the band. After this is Wonderous Stories, very similar to turn of the centuary, but good none the less. <br /> <br />Then you get Awaken, which is not Yes' best attempt at a long song. It is however, very satisfying, and technically execellent. Beinging with the pianos of Rick Wakeman, the song is probably the most catchy Yes epic.  <br /> <br />This is a very interesting album. Released at the tail end of the sunshine era, it shows a less adventerous, experimental Yes, and a more focused, Song oriented one. It is clearly the turning point between the cerebral 70's and the simplistic 80's eras of yes. What is interesting is that this album, which sounds easily out of the 80's, was written by 4/5 of the band which made the awe-inspiring, life changing, epitomy of music \\"Close to the Edge\\" and the same band which released the gargantuan, multi-layered, experimental \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Yes and really love \\"90215\\", or \\"Big Gennerator\\" or \\"Talk\\" and want to test the waters on the more classic Yes albums, this is a fantastic place to start. If you hold \\"Fragile\\", \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", and \\"Relayer\\" as amazing peices of music...then give it a try. Its not as amazing, but its still Yes and its still good. <br /> <br />I docked 1 point because this album does not sound timeless. It sounds very very stuck in the 70's, and does not have that trancendental sound which many other Yesalbums do.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I don't watch much television anymore because I'm so busy, but I keep Sunday nights free now.  All of my friends, and some of my family in other states, love this show.  When we don't get together to watch the show, we get a conference call going on our cell phones during the commercials to discuss what has been going on.  My friends and I relate to the characters on a personal level.  It's kind of nice to see that people in high-stress situations (as surgery obviously would be) go through a lot of the same crap we do.  I think it's a combination of great actors/actresses and wonderful writing.  It really shows the human side of medicine without forgetting the professional.  I also like that, while I don't always understand all of the terms, it doesn't go over my head.  The writing is geared to the audience, not just medical professionals.  The personal stories are things we deal with on a daily basis.<br /><br />It's nice to act like a Teenager again.  I get to let go of everything for an hour a week and just enjoy the show.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show is my one will-not-miss show every week.  I used to be stuck on ER, but the writing for this show is more consistently enjoyable and has more character depth than some of ER's episodes in recent years.  The story lines are well thought out, and the characters are all so dynamic and more human.  This is a great television DVD; one that will probably get worn out and replaced in my household!
B000002H2H|5.0|Remember back in the day when Metallica was anti establichment and did music for the love and the art-form of it. I grew up listening to Metallica, my uncle got me to them when I was 8, but when the Black album came out, it probably brought Metallica some wanted and unwanted attention, fame and money.    But before that, there were 4 other albums that all the Preps don't know about, maybe because MTV did not fan the flames sort to speak, but this album was a thrash masterpiece from the guitar solos, James' strong and powerful vocals, bass that would cut through ice and drumming clinic. The sound is very raw, almost if recorded at a crazy concert but with the fans turned off. Songs like Ride the Lightning and Fight Fire with Fire are what a thrash song should be, insane, fast and powerful with guitar riffs and solos that made Metallica. Songs like Fade to Black is a serious, emotional song about suicide that at points seem very dark and creepy. Yet this album will be a masterpiece and inevitably lead into their masterpiece Master Of Puppets, but this album has a very strong shine to it. This is a must for any Metal fan i general, even if you dislike them now due to their high profile meltdowns and letdowns, here you have a hungry Metallica, and thats great anyway.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Simply put, this is the best movie I've seen in a while.  Though a little slow, the speed that the movie goes helps build up the characters to help know who they are and how they feel.  Ang Lee did a great job, and the actors were supurb!
B000002UJQ|5.0|First off, i'm alright with the radiohead bashing. but some people do take it to the extreme. It's cool though if it's just not your thing.  <br /> <br />Lyrically and musically, I think this album sounds terrific. The guitar work in some of the songs never ceases to amaze me. I am a big fan of older psychadelic/prog music from yes to pink floyd and that's why Paranoid android is probably my favorite song on the album. The song is modern psychadelic rock at its finest.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Giving the original King Kong an A, I would have to give this one a solid B. The deleted scenes should have been in Jackson's original version and much of the early New York scenes cut. Only enough of the New York scenes were needed to set the time and characters. The rest was a waste of film. The creature computer effects are stunning as is the scenery on Skull Island. The human characters are so so character wise and Jack Black as Carl Denham was terrible. Naomi Watts did give a fairly good performance though. The star of the film of course is Kong ( played by Andy Serkis using motion capture )and the Weta team did an incredible job of making him truely believable.     If you own a Bluray player, that disc contains both versions and is stunning in Hi Def.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Photographically speaking, Advent Children is far and away the most significant offering of CGI animation I have ever seen. The images marry photorealism with the artistry of the more contemporary Anime style character designs that far surpass the previous Final Fantasy film offering \\"The Spirits Within,\\" which we all hope will someday fade into obscurity.  <br />Fundamentally, anyone familiar with the FF7 game will enjoy this film which, unlike most movies based on video games, doesn't feel like you're watching someone else play a video game but more like a second act of a trilogy- you get to revisit old friends and see how much (if at all) they have changed.  <br />The uninitiated may want to consider asking a friend in the know about the significance of Materia, its relationship to the world and weapons the characters in habit and why it is so important to the Shinra organization. Even without, however, the fight sequences have such artistry and beauty it's almost impossible not to appreciate it if not on any other level but a visceral one.  <br />On a dramatic level, the film plays out not unlike much of the fiction and anime that comes out of Japan these days: A story arc of enormous proportions that meanders just enough to confuse the average American viewer which ultimately leaves a few ends intentionally untied. What does work on both sides of the Pacific, however works fantastically. The manner in which each character is reintroduced, is nothing less than thrilling (especially the reveal of at least one character you might not expect to see in this film) and the notion that while these characters are hyper powerful, they are still, in fact, mortal. The \\"stunts\\" in Advent Children are executed with such precision, you can't help but worry about the \\"actors\\" involved.  <br />Overall, Advent Children might not be the most universally recognized of films, but it definitely operates on a level that makes it worth taking a chance on.  <br /> <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have seen both the movie and the stage version of Rent.  I love both of them.  But, we're here to talk about the movie.  I love the fact that most of the original cast is back for this.  Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp are perfect as Roger and Mark. Adam shows the tortured soul that is Roger.  Finding out he has HIV and dealing with his girlfriend's death puts him in a place he never thought he would be.  Mark, Collins, Angel, and Mimi help him realize that he isn't dead yet. Adam takes you through that journey with all the emotions that entails.  Anthony shows Mark's emotions throughout the piece. The look on his face when he sees that Roger has come out of the house, and come to the Life Support meeting shows you just how much he cares for his best friend, and how worried he was, and still is for him.  Having them in two sepereate locations for \\"What You Own\\" also helps the characters and gives the actors a new way of playing the scene.  When they come together on the roof and you see the emotion as they say \\"I'm not alone,\\" that is when they both come to the realization that they aren't alone and they don't have to be.  And I have both the OBC and Movie soundtracks, and I've got to say their preformances on the movie soundtrack have improved.  How can you not love Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel?  He is Angel.  Jesse L. Martin blew me away as Collins.  And if you have seen him in Law and Order, you will love him in this.  Wilson and Jesse together are a terrific pair and to see them portray Angel and Collin's relationship is magic.  I do think Taye Diggs was a little underused, but with having to condense the play to a movie time frame, Benny was the one who would have to suffer.  Idina Menzel rules as Maureen, but neither she nor the actress who I just saw play the part will make me like Over the Moon.  That is not my favorite moment in either the movie or the play.  Now, to the new additions.  In my humble opinion, Rosario Dawson blew Daphne Rubin-Vega out of the water.  I thought Daphne sounded whiny as Mimi, Rosario brought life, depth, and fun to her.  Tracie Thoms as Joanne was a wonderful addition.  I did miss Fredi Walker's voice, but Tracie held her own and made the part hers.  Another reviewer seems to think that Adam Pascal and Idina Menzel are suffering from detoriating voices.  That is not the case.  Adam's preformance, as I said before, exceeded the OBC version.  If you don't like hearing his voice in Rent, then I recommend a change of pace, there is the OBC of Aida and his two solo albums, Model Prisoner and Civilian, that will give you a different prespective. Idina hasn't suffered from her preformance in Wicked, she has improved. I look forward to watching the DVD and the deleted scenes, which from what I understand will include the rest of \\"Goodbye Love\\" and \\"Halloween.\\"  Unfortunatly, \\"Contact\\" wouldn't have worked in the movie.  Seeing Collins holding Angel in his arms at the hospital brought you to the same place emotionally as the end of Contact.  I hope that the people who didn't see this in the theater will give it a chance on DVD.  The story line is still relevant.  There are still people living with, and dying from, AIDS.  Jonathan Larson's vision still rings true.  \\"There's only us, there's only this.  Forget regret, or life is yours to miss.  No other road, no other way.  No day but today.\\"
B00005JNDZ|1.0|A Saint Bridget Jones Fan Don't Buy this DVD.<br /><br />The 1st Bridget Jones movie is lovely but this one is awful!. Bridget Jones now becomes so dislikable and offensive one wants to vomit. It's very sad that Bridget Jones' character is murdered by \\"The Edge of Reason.\\"<br /><br />The intentions making this change in Bridget's character is plainly mean. Most of the people who love Bridget Jones' Diary are women with \\"silly romantic notions.\\" They image that the lovely \\"Bridget\\" is their reflection or someone they can relate to. The filmmakers of \\"The Edge of Reason\\" not only intentionally want to spoil their fun but also want to make fools out of them all. Now by making the biggest fool out of Bridget's character \\"The Edge of Reason\\" becomes a movie of ridicules! Bridget Jones now is not only obese but also extremely insecure, much more insecure than before so she is a completely unlikable laughing stock. So are all those who want to relate to the Bridget Jones character!<br /><br />What man would want to saddle with an awful foolish female like \\"The Edge of Reason\\" Bridget Jone? Certainly not a man like Mr. Darcy!<br /><br />Well unless Mr. Darcy becomes a retard himself over \\"The Edge of Reason.\\"<br /><br />When it comes to watch your beloved character got sabotaged,  all the reasons don't spend any money on people who spoil your fun! Don't buy this DVD, read the book instead!

B000BKVQTS|3.0|The german psyche that spawned these 18th century fairy tales, put to paper by the Brothers Grimm, is as deep and dark as the woods the stories take place in.  The Grimms wanted to document their literary culture, but found in time that children were engrossed with these stories.  Various publications, including their own, softened the gruesome tales. <br /> <br />This is a fictitious story of the Grimms as con men, who cure villages for a fee, of the ghosts they themselves are fabricating.  The opening of the movie shows one Grimm brother, buying 'magic beans' instead of getting his dying sister medicine.  This is repeatedly referred to throughout the film, as one brother makes the other feel guilty about their sister's death throughout life.  There is no point to this though, and no resolution.  It is just a loose thread that makes no sense. <br /> <br />Napoleon, apparently, forces the Grimms to investigate a real mystery in a German forest.  The Grimms find a truly enchanted forest, and unlock a series of tales...from the gingerbread man to Rapunzel, that forms the basis of the books they eventually write.  The stories however, are not all that dark or interesting, and the climax of the film is a given. <br /> <br />A darker or more satirical film was warrented of this fascinating topic, that is, how a culture's dark stories reflect their own dark nature.  One can easily imagine that this might have been a theme in an earlier script version.  But like the Grimm's own tales, the final film seems watered down and softened for the masses, losing its dark edge.

0312935579|4.0|Emma Harte is a larger-than-life heroine into whose story you are immediately swept. From her impoverished childhood on the Yorkshire moors through her rise to the heights of wealth and its inherent possessions, Emma's story is engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening.<br /><br />Emma Harte is not the most likeable of heroines. In fact, I was turned off by her need for vengeance and her vendetta of sixty plus years. Her total absorption with money was also off-putting. Nevertheless, because the roots of her needs were so obvious, her story was believable and enjoyable to follow, if not always admirable.<br /><br />When we first meet her she is an elderly woman who has a huge bombshell to explode at a family gathering. Although we must wait nearly 700 pages to understand the dimensions of this, the wait is worth it. Also worth the 700+ pages are Emma's rise from poverty, the endearing people she meets along the way, and the great story that pairs her with the love of her life---and it's not either of her husbands!<br /><br />From Blackie O'Neill, her lusty life-long friend, to the charming Kallinski family who becomes her lifeline, to the angelic Laura who becomes her dearest friend, this is the story of a young girl, a woman, a mother who achieves much and loses much.  However, she endures to reap the rewards and the heartaches of a long life.<br /><br />Through two world wars and across the English landscape, the story develops and enchants. However, one rather large piece of titillating information is left unexplained, and I found this rather disheartening.
0767020308|4.0|Kate Beckinsale charmingly portrays my favorite Jane Austen heroine in this production of Emma.  The only negative comment I can make is that it is too short of a film.  If they had allowed for more time, like in the BBC production of Pride & Prejudice, the story could have been even better.
B000E1MTV8|5.0|HD-DVD is the best all around product.  Do not listen to whatever idiot wrote the piece about Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray is only good for playing PS3 games.  It will not give you full interactivity with PCs and other equipment.  People will try to get you to support Blu-Ray only so their PS3 is not obsolete.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey and his piece 'based on a true story' was being a perfect addict when he embellished items in his book.  After all, as addicts we believe we are never good enough, our stories are never dramatic enough.  OF COURSE he believed that the truth was not enough to satisfy readers. As an opiate addict who is now sober, I have met all of those people written about in his book.  The stories may not have been entirely accurate in the context of HIS story, but I have seen them ALL occur.  His 'Million Little Pieces' is an accurate, valuable look at addiction and treatment in our culture.
0792838068|4.0|Very good movie. Nicholas Cage plays a drunk who cant get his life together. He meets Elizabeth Shue who is a prostitute and for a short time they have a relationship. They start off as friends and she really wants to help him. A lot of sad things happen throughout the movie and there is a gang rape scene that was horrible to watch. The ending is extremely sad. I liked this movie a lot because it is real and this happens to millions of people everywhere. It makes you feel good about your life .. trust me.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|What I liked in \\"Lord of War\\" is that it's rather ambiguous. I don't know whether to feel for Cage's character or resent him. Anyway the movie leaves an uneasy feeling after itself which seemed a bit strange and not usual for a relatively big-budget, major hollywood film. You can't even tell if it has a happy ending or not.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is totally truthful, maybe some things were slightly exaggerated, but in general I think noone will have doubts that all shown in film is exactly the way it is in real life. Being myself from Russia I can tell all the parts about selling Russian and Ukranian arms are true, after the Soviet Union fell to pieces there were immense amounts of tanks, cannons, different weapons and ammunition stolen and sold nobody knows where to. Well, not only 15 years ago - there are lots of weapons being stolen and sold nowdays in Russia. In every country that's at war (and Russia now is at war with Chechnia) there are many possibilities to earn money selling guns.<br /><br />The only thing that was not truthful in the film is HOW Russia and its people were shown. It just made me laugh, I recalled old American movies of a cold-war period that depicted Russians in a very funny way. Actually noone talks like that and behaves like that. But if you've never been here I think it looks just fine. I've never been to Africa, and African scenes looked fine to me although now I think they might also have some flaws.<br /><br />Generally speaking \\"Lord of War\\" is about choices we make, and it demonstrates vividly how these choices affect our lives on business and personal level. About acting I have to say Nicolas Cage is doing his usual work, nothing extraordinary, Jared Leto - the same story. But I was blown away by Ethan Hawke - he's totally believable, seems like he's a real interpol agent put on screen.<br /><br />I think it's difficult not to like this movie - it's too serious, thought-provoking and powerful. Definately worth a look.
0679422714|1.0|I kept reading this book for half month then gave up--no need to waste more time. This is a book full of misusing of materials and misinterpretation. For people who lost their father or mother in the culture revolution like one of the author, they have all the rights to hate Mao personally. But this does not mean that they can misinterpretate history from a very biased view. There are many times during my reading that I just laughed out how the authors try to portait Mao as an uncomparable evil monster. It is no doubt Mao has many shortcomings and many very wrong decisions. But it is so funny to try to describe him as a such monster full of horrible evils. <br /> <br />   If you do not want to waste time, no need to read this. If you want to read for fun and see how biased a book could be, 1/3 of the whole book is enough.
B000000H3W|5.0|SEPULTURA - Arise <br />- <br />This album, along with `Far Beyond Driven', `South of Heaven, and `Master of Puppets' are what caused my transformation into the metal-head I am today.  I am forever indebted to this CD.  <br /> <br />This is a Thrash Masterpiece.... Max's Voice, while still growing at this point, was still one of the most vicious metal singers of the day.  His guitar work, as well as the work of Andreas was amazing... precisely fast with aggressive riffs and amazing (and even sometimes innovative) solos...   Paulo Jr. plays with such a sense of urgency and provides an excellent backing to the guitars.  And last, but certainly not least is Max's Brother Igor.  Ideally from a musical perspective Max should have been playing in the shadow of his brother, not the other way around.  Igor's drumming is furious yet still implementing his `tribal' vibe (Not as much as he would expand on this for future albums)  <br /> <br />Arise is easily on the best Thrash Metal Albums to see the light of day...  The 4-Piece Brazilian Metal heads would continue to make 2 more incredible tribal influenced metal albums... but the pure thrash aggression of this album was never equaled in their future works. <br /> <br />Favorite Songs: C.I.U, Arise, and Dead Embryonic Cells <br />-5 Stars <br /> <br /> <br />IF YOU LIKED, AGREED OR APPRECIATED THIS.

B000002KO1|5.0|Well, it's official: I'm old. About to turn 40, so I went back to replace some of the vinyl of my youth with CDs. Which I'll no doubt have to replace with mp3s or some new technology next week. <br /> <br />Ah, but I digress. This is the first album I ever bought. I still own it, in fact, complete with the little stars I penned by each song to rank my favorites. Listening to them now, I'd say I was quite accurate -- they still are.  <br /> <br />By chance, I think the first album I bought might still be the best of them all. I still hear what excited me so much then. These songs are alive; they're raw, they're adventurous, they're unique, they're compelling. Simply, they're just flat-out good. The Pretenders were -- and remain -- one of only a few bands that created songs that were almost genre free; fast or slow, poppy or punk, sultry, poignant or defiant, they all worked flawlessly. The songs aren't particularly complex or metaphorical, but each is so perfectly realized it's hard not feel slightly exhilarated listening to it, no matter how many times you have. <br /> <br />Honestly, I almost wish I hadn't had my rock-and-roll awakening on the late '70s, because after being baptised in a flood of remarkable new music, the search to recapture that spark over the last two decades has been largely futile, and at this point I'm a bit too old to really care anymore. But I can always listen to the Pretenders and remember how it made rock and roll seem perfect and limitless.
B000092Q4U|4.0|LAMB OF GOD - As the Palaces Burn <br />- <br />Not only is this their album I've listened to the most, but it is also my favorite album by them.  Lamb of God is one of the few bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement that I feel has been true to themselves.  Despite high volumes of popularity they haven't sacrificed their goal for musical metal Armageddon.   <br /> <br />Now I agree with some of the Vocal criticisms... Randy's voice is a bit odd at times and can at times be hard to swallow.  (Personally I enjoy it... specially, in contrast to say... Shadows Fall's vocalist - who sounds beyond forced when he screams or sings.)  Lyrically it is hostile but with a bit more `intelligent' than much of Randy's counterparts.  <br />Musically however LoG, is well beyond the NWoAHM trend, Chris Adler (Drums) is probably the finest Groove-oriented Metal Drummer since Vinnie Paul.  The guitar work is handled by Willie Adler and Mark Morten, who though not as technical as some other guitarists, make up for it with creativity... For example they use a lot of atonal single notes which makes them sound so urgently heavy.  The bass is handled by John Campbell, who is a good bass player by metal accounts however the sound in the mix is pushed far into the background.  <br /> <br />All in all I highly recommend this disk for fans that may be into the NWoAHM, or just metal in general.  Also any Pantera fans looking for someone to take the southern-death torch need not search any further.  <br /> <br />Favorite Songs:  As the Palaces Burn, 11th Hour, Ruin and Vigil. <br />-4.25 Stars <br /> <br />IF YOU LIKED, AGREED OR APPRECIATED THIS.

0198534469|5.0|This is a great book for a Complex analysis course, especially when combined with a more traditional text like Ahlfors or Knopp's Theory of Functions.  Needham's geometric approach builds 'feel' for the subject and manages to include a huge range of topics.  Sometimes just trying to work out what you are seeing in a particular visualization can lead to new insights.  All in all its an innovative and well written book.
B000B8QF14|1.0|Alright! Green Day! My favorite ambiguous emo-punk-pop disaster's still as popular as ever, luckily. I just love this live DVD. A jewel case? Man, that works so well with the faux-melancholic nature of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and others. This DVD is superb, I just cherish every moment of a grade school dropout strutting around in a king's crown. I've always dreamed of listening to guitar and vocal studio overdubs to compensate for lack of real talent. Green Day delivers!!<br /><br />An American guy bellowing \\"ENGLAND!!\\" every two seconds in a British accent? That proves Green Day aren't posers.<br /><br />Furthermore, Green Day's audience is a very open-minded and intelligent lot. As one reviewer proudly proclaimed, \\"if u think this cd sucks then u suck.[sic]\\"<br /><br />Boy, Green Day fans can offer some real intellectual stimulation.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I think its too late for me to review this album. But right now I wanna give a piece of my thought here. <br /> <br />I've bought this CD quite a long time ago. I think immediately after I know its release. I bought it only based on \\"Per Te\\" that I accidently heard on TV. The songs is beautiful enough to move me. I'm glad I did what I did because this CD is more than i expected. All songs in this CD is beautiful and perfect. Like i could not ask for more. I think this CD that makes me to the point that i wanna be a grobanites in overnight. I turn back to look for his previous CD which i only knew one song -\\"You're Still You\\" from Ally McBeal series. <br /> <br />This CD is really good and a must have for everybody. I guaranty that you will love this album and the voice that makes all the songs beautiful and perfect. I strongly recomment this CD is a MUST HAVE or you'll be missing the great of musics can offer you.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|This movie gets 2 stars and not 1, only because of Julia Roberts, and because a small part of the dialogue is funny and entertaining. Nothing else worse mentioning other than 2 couples hurting each other on your TV screen for 2 hours for almost no reason at all while using all kind of bad language.<br />Weak characters, weak story, weak acting, bad scenery, nice music, good quality DVD; In other words, save your dollars.
B00004YKUY|3.0|I purchased this CD after buying \\"Journey 2001\\".  I'm very impressed with Steve Augeri's vocals and the drummer Castronovo - this guy can beat the tar out of those skins!!<br /><br />I was curious to see how the rest of the \\"Arrival\\" sounded after hearing \\"Higher Place\\" and \\"All The Way\\".  Unfortunately I have to report that while some of the elements of the vintage Journey sound, this is a rather ho, hum release; sporatic energy.  \\"Higher Place\\" is a great song - NOT \\"Seperate Ways II\\" as some have deceived themselves; \\"Message of Love\\" from \\"Trial By Fire\\" is more inline for this nomination.<br /><br />What's very interesting about \\"Arrival\\" is only \\"Nothin' Comes Close\\" \\"Live and Beath\\" and \\"Kiss Me Softly\\" are the only songs written by Schon/Cain/Augeri without any other outside help; the latter is a great ballad and probably ranks up there with \\"Other Arms\\" and \\"Faithfully\\".<br /><br />I thought \\"All The Things\\", \\"Livin' To Do\\", and \\"I Got A Reason\\" were flat, little energy.<br /><br />The rest of the other songs are good but not great.  I would would rank this release on the same level as \\"Departure\\" and \\"Raised on Radio\\" - good but not great.
B00008BRBG|4.0|Born out of the tail end of the British punk scene, this debut album by the Police is a severely underrated offering.  Sting gives us a hint of his great lyric-writing abilities so evident on future albums on tracks like \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Born in the 50's\\".  It becomes very clear as one listens to the tracks here that this is not your usual run-of-the-mill punk band with lame, brain-dead lyrics and 3-chord 4/4 time music but the great musicianship of Summers, Copeland and Sumner and the complex stylings and arrangements of the compositions come to the fore on \\"Hole In My Life\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\"  This digipak version is a real treat too as the sound quality is very well remastered and sounds excellent.  Recommended.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|With a plot that seems to wander from place to place it can be difficult to follow, however, Donnie Darko's various storylines are necessary for the plot to work.  Try to view them as tributaries all coming together to form a greater river, or in this case film.  I thought that fresh faces and the veterans melded seemlessly into a great cast.  This is the kind of film that depends on direction, plot, and acting, not a 300 million dollar special effects ILM crapfest.  I know everybody mentions the soundtrack but that is for a reason, it's great.
B000000OQF|4.0|Appetite For Destruction is a great album after Greatest Hits and contains great classic songs like Paradise City, Sweet Child O' Mine, & Rocket Queen. But this is not my favorite, Greatest Hits is my favorite.

0393317552|4.0|Another work of sweeping scope that seeks to understand what the factors either in human nature or environmental circumstance have led to Western European civilization's domination of the world. Diamond identifies numerous factors in the environment (access to cultivable Fertile Crescent crops, presence of animal species suitable for work, East-West continental alignment) and history of Europe that make the dominance of its civilization inevitable. Human genetic factors are also examined and proven inconsequential to the dominance of the White Caucasian. This book carefully lays out a counter-argument to any physical anthropological theories of racial superiority. At times the multitude of examples in this 450+ page tome seem redundant. Pulitzer Prize winner.

B000BZ99WY|4.0|I just finished reading this book and could understand why the author was so traumatized.  To want to help so badly and be unable to do so must have been agonizing. My only complaint was that the number of people involved made  it hard to keep track of everyone, though the glossary helped.  Also, the book does not have a comprehensive background as to where this hatred came from.  Overall, it was well written, and you could sense the frustration of him in dealing with the bureaucracy of the U.N. and other countries.  We are all human.  To Romeo Daillaire, I am so sorry the U.S did not help.

B0000WN0ZK|3.0|I am not a film student. I do not watch movies to gain some deep philosophical insight.  I am open minded, however, and do not restrict my movie going experience to the latest drivel that Hollywood is churning out.  That is the reason that I viewed this DVD twice.  First on my own, then with the help of the commentary track.  Here are my observations. <br /> <br />I found myself scratching my head and/or yawning while watching the first time.  What's up with the mimes in the jeep?  What's the point of the antique shop/propeller?  How did we get into this bizarre Yardbirds concert?  Tennis anyone? <br /> <br />I must say that the film was more enjoyable with the help of the commentary and the previous viewing.  Although even the commentator couldn't explain the mimes, antique shop or propeller.   <br /> <br />My final assessment is that Antonioni was trying to make a commercial abstract film, which is an oxy-moron.  Not enough of either to make this a success.  Am I glad I saw it? Yes.  Do I want to see it again? No way.
B000022TSW|4.0|This movie is certainly a laugh riot. Cartman is one hell of a cool kid with his over-the-top attitude and his song, \\"Kyle's Mom is a B#$%@\\" in D Minor. All the songs are catchy and never bland. The one-liners will get you every time. Almost everything here is not meant for deep thinking; it's just for fun.<br /><br />But be warned: this cartoon is not for kids, this is for us, the adults. So if you have kids, watch it when they're all asleep in their beds.

0553213105|5.0|I am one of those people who reads the classics simply because it's a good thing to do. With dreams of someday becoming a writer, it almost seems necessary to me to read all of the great works. That was what started me on reading Pride and Predjudice. I was completely sucked in!<br /><br />From the first paragraph about the \\"obvious\\" intentions of a bachelor and his wishes to marry, to the ending underplayed scenes between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, this book is an utter delight from the get-go. Lizzy is by far the best female protagonist I have ever read about. I can relate to her on nearly every level and was thoroughly engrossed in the story.<br /><br />When you begin having dreams of being a character in a book, you know that the book has taken you to a new level. This one had me dreaming for weeks. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants a good classic story. You'll never forget it.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The Collectors Giftset of Sex and the City is great! A must have for any die hard fan of the show. I absolutely love the show and couldn't wait for my order to arrive.

If you know someone who loves Sex and The City this is the perfect gift.
0553801503|2.0|I began to realize that the problem with Martin's capacity to kill off characters on a whim (which is starting and cool at the time) tends to kill all the momentum that he creates to that point in time. <br /> <br />This book felt like one of Robert Jordon's books between 6-9.  Nothing happened and you know that it will be forever till you see the next real book.  I know that he split the book but my understanding is that he will focus on the other characters.  So all that means is that we can expect very little progress in their lives as well.

Don't even bother renting it, just buy the series; trust me, you won't regret it! <br /> <br />Whedon's cowboys in space saga is one of the most original, brilliantly conceived, and perfectly executed sci-fi shows you will ever see. Its blend of drama, action, and that trademark Whedonesque sarcastic humor is perfection. <br /> <br />Truly, one of the worst decisions ever made by a network was cancelling this series. I live in hope that more movies or another TV series may yet happen.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|By now I'll assume that you've read the description and know what the show is about.

B00005JKOI|5.0|Have to love this movie!!!<br /><br />Pretty in Pink is a must have for any true movie lover. Basic cinderella story with a little something special. Great movie for a first date.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald, Guilty Pleasure, 1980's Suburbia<br /><br />\\"Pretty in Pink,\\" along with \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and \\"Sixteen Candles\\" are the three movies that made Molly Ringwald America's favorite prom date in the 1980's. Of the films associated with Ringwald (and the rest of the \\"Brat Pack\\"), few are still enjoying any regular circulation now. What is sad is how most of the people who starred in these films and once enjoyed A-List status have fallen beneath the mainstream horizon. The interesting thing is the way these films portray an idealized, bittersweet suburban-princess ghetto that never existed but has become part of American mythology that still draws young people like moths to a flame. The films mentioned at the top of this review, along with \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" could comprise a modern day \\"golden age\\" legend for exurban teens. \\"Pretty in Pink\\" was probably the most financially successful of Molly's follies (it wasn't the best or the funniest, that was \\"Sixteen Candles\\") and probably stands as a central monument for that last gasp of films that could unapologetically be about nothing at all and still make for good entertainment. These movies were not made for anyone over 20-except as guilty pleasures-and should not be measured or criticized as any more than the fluff they were intended to be...but what's wrong with guilty pleasure?
0393317552|2.0|As the West sits and ponders its role in the world, this book could provide solice to those looking for a reason why the west has become the dominate culture in the world.<br /><br />While our grandfather's grandfather accepted this as a burden, Diamond gives the politically correct a way out as the answer to why we have more stuff is due to factors beyond our control.  Those factors are geographic, how the contienents are structured, the types of animals and the types of plants at our disposal.<br /><br />So this book represents a way out for those who are embarrased by our cultural and mateiral success. Its not our fault. In fact Diamond starts by saying that people from primitive societies are probably smarter and more clever than we are.  That certainly may be true, but it is an indirect way of relieving us from responsibilities as global citizens.<br /><br />Much of Diamonds book is repetitive with the same root causes leading to deep and percieved irreversable trends that determine the fate of societies.  These can be use to justify persistent polarization of wealth along the North/South axis.<br /><br />Some people told me to read this book because it was important.  Sorry but its not and you will probably get more from reading these reviews many of which summarize the book, rather than investing the time in it yourself.<br /><br />A big pass on this one, unless you want to feel better about your material wealth and standing.

0394826817|5.0|I bought this book thinking to teach my son about manners, saying please and thank you.  He does say please and thank you, but the book taught even more about going to school, playing safe, etc.  He loves the characters Huckle and Lowly very much.  He loves the book and since he was so familiar with the characters I bought him the Richard Scarry's Best Learning Video Ever (DVD). He watches it over and over and sings along.  Huckle and Lowly are great.  Great book!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Although targetted to women at first, the show gained popularity with a wide male audience,both straight and gay. The cast is top notch and all the characters resemble someone that we all know in our own private Wisteria Lanes. Who does not have the nosy neighbor? The soccer mom or the go getter? And is there not the sexy mom or newcomer that everyone talks about? And who does not know someone hiding a long held secret? The show is amusing, dark, and hooks you from the first, with the mystery of why one of the ladies killed herself, when her life appeared perfect. The chemistry amongst the characters and the quirky writing made for an entertaining tv season. Let's hope the second time around is as good as the first!
1591396190|5.0|Over the past four months I have been looking for good business books on subjects of interest in vain and this book has been worth the search.  Kim and Mauborgne have taken a look at how to create new markets.  The value of this book is in the tools used to help identify new markets.  To be honest the tools are not particularly unique and the ideas and examples are ones that have been used before.<br /><br />What makes this book a must read is the way the tools are described and illustrated -- some of the best I have ever seen.  The tools are clear, explainable, and something that you yourself can use on your own company, a triple win that is rare in business books.<br /><br />The weak part of the book is its organization and its obsession with the term \\"blue ocean\\".  The reader just has to work their way through the terms, something that you can do.<br /><br />The book is well organized and while it starts a little slow and you may need to push your way through the first 50 - 60 pages, the push is worth it.<br /><br />Part 1: Describes what we mean by a blue ocean strategy which is one that revolves around creating new markets where there are few customers.  This is created through doing a strategy canvas that looks at your performance relative to the rest of the industry.<br /><br />Part 2: Goes through the process of formulating the strategy.  It talks about how you find your blue ocean.  Frankly, the first part of this section is not particularly strong, very conceptual.  The last part that talks about the strategy formulation process is good.<br /><br />Part 3: Executing the Blue Ocean Strategy is an innovative and good way of looking at managing enterprise change.  In particular, the part talks about a non-traditional and innovative approach to leading change.  The notion of \\"tipping point\\" change management is something every executive should know about.<br /><br />A good book, with great tools that one can apply.  That makes the book well worth the effort to understand, particularly as you move into the middle of the book.rth the effort to understand, particularly as you move into the middle of the book.

0783225725|2.0|Most Clint Eastwood movies are great but this one is just too Clint for even Clint to pull off he tries to hard to be really badass and comes off just being a jerk, the plot lacks and they kept showing the same stupid flashback over and over it was about ten minuts long and they showed it over and over, slowing down the movie to the point where most of the people with me did not even finsh it. However there is a migget side kick so if your into that then this movie will probably be great.

B0009VTFB0|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.
B000301YY8|5.0|Take a good listen to this debut album by England's latest sensation, James Blunt. I guarantee his will be a name that will be repeated several times at next year's Grammy ceremony. If you listen to mainstream radio, it's almost certain you're already familiar with his Top 5 hit single \\"You're Beautiful.\\" If not, you should be. But even if you're not a fan of the song, please don't dismiss the rest of this CD, which is the best from a new artist in months. With Blunt's flawless falsetto and his imaginative lyrics, he brings something fresh that has been missing in the industry for a long time - uniqueness. Blunt has slowly crept into our heads over the past couple of months, and a listen to selections such as \\"Tears and Rain,\\" \\"Goodbye My Lover,\\" \\"Cry\\" and \\"No Bravery\\" will secure the fact that the music industry is still chockfull of artists that have something exceptional to offer. If I were to compare Blunt to any legends, it would be to the early days of the Bee Gees, prior to their Saturday Night Fever heyday, when they were making darker and more introspective recordings such as \\"Lonely Days\\" and \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart.\\" I urge you to pick this one up and give it a listen. The best barometer of a record is when it can appeal to 16 year-olds on up to listeners in their 40's, and for those who appreciate intelligent lyrics and melodies, in their 60's and beyond. This is a man for all ages. Pick it up and prove me right. If anything I described appeals to you, I guarantee you will have found YOUR favorite new artist, as I have found mine.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Fun Fun Fun<br /><br />I Love this show, its NEVER boring and the cast is lively and engaging. Veronica is a sassy and determined good \\"guy\\" out for the truth about the death of her best friend, and she helps many others along the way.

0385424736|5.0|It was true to the movie, which was wonderful.  I highly reccommend the book and Amazon offered it at a much lower price than Barnes and Noble.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Like most of the reviewers below, I liked this version a lot -- again, not as good as the BBC version, but it came mighty close.  I particularly liked the dance scenes, which I felt had so much life and passion to them that was missing in the BBC version -- the BBC scenes were much more genteel.  The main actors were wonderful (particularly Keira Knightley).  The close ups of Dame Judi Dench were a little hard to take on the big screen, and I felt she played it over the top. My only other complaint was the last scene (I won't give it away) -- but it was way too modern for my taste and didn't seem to fit the period.  But all in all, a wonderful movie, I do recommend it highly.
B000002JKS|4.0|I have listened to most of Robert Plant solos.  I remember all the buzz from both the media and fans when his first solo album came out.  He has never disappointed.  He is a true talent and has an excellent ear for all types of music and uses those influences in each of his albums. Shaken 'N' Stirred came out in 1985, a time when there was more emphasis on keyboards and rhythm.  His fans were probably expecting more of Pictures At Eleven or The Principle of Moments.  He experimented a little and that's what makes him special. I remember reading the mixed reviews he received for this album.  To some of his fans \\"Shaken 'N' Stirred\\" might be dated, but I feel that it's a timeless classic.  I can listen to this album today and enjoy it as much as I did in 1985.   <br />
B00000K31Q|5.0|Nothing to Hate about this Film<br /><br />10 Things I Hate about You is one of the best films made in our generation for our generation. Although it is loosely based off of the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew, One could not tell this unless he/she were to see the play close to when the movie came out. The screenwriters did an excellent job covering up the fact that the plot is centuries old. This modern day version is set in a high school, a very strange place for a Shakespeare play. Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), a sophomore, is the lovely daughter of a gynecologist who delivers babies for a living. Her father makes a rule that she cannot date until her sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does, a heartless senior who could not care less about men. This has never been a problem before but now there is a new boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who moved to town and they both have an eye for each other. In a desperate attempt to be able to date the lovely Bianca, Joey interviews some tough guys from school. None of them are willing to try to date Kat. Finally, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), a senior who just moved into the area, is willing to do the dirty job, but for some cash. This means that Bianca and her prince can engage in several dates. The dad, meanwhile, is going ballistic, his plan to keep Bianca from dating, forever, is going south. The next thing that he knows Kat wants to go to the Prom with Patrick, which da! da! da! means that Bianca can go too. The movie was an overall success. The plot was interesting, thanks to Shakespeare, but with a new twist that renews the old love story into one that can be enjoyed by our generation. While it did not follow the play exactly, it did do a wonderful job sticking to the basic ideas and keeping the overall emotions the same.
B000BYA5G4|3.0|The movie is introduced with a sweet CGI effect.  You are taken through a gun-manufacturing factory from the point of view of a bullet that ultimately ends up in the head of an innocent child.      Nicholas Cage plays a russian under an assumed Jewish identity in New York.  He is surrounded by violence and he begins selling guns.  He continues to position himself increasingly deeper in the gun trade.  He gets his brother involved early on, but soon \\"loses\\" him to a dark side of the game.  His life becomes a mess, as he gets involved with drugs and his downfall begins.      He goes against his better judgment and his sense of invincibility becomes weakness.  Just when you think the curtain is about to fall on our \\"hero\\", you are exposed to a piece of information that will blow your mind (kind of).  The fact that the movie is based on true events should be enough to sicken most Americans.    This is a good movie.  It's very well done, although something about it makes it feel as though it's all been done before.  The narration reminded me of Goodfellas...
B00005JMAH|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.<br /><br />All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie.
0307276902|5.0|A great book for all to read, Put it on your to read list. <br />Should be a required reading for all high school seniors.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Flawless and Beautifully Rieveting<br /><br />\\"The Joy Luck Club\\" has to be the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will be the only one of it's kind. The story is beautiful and timeless and I encourage everyone to see it. It makes you think of the relationships of your family and how, even though this is a movie, it can impact you beyond belief. It will rock you to the core of your being and I am living proof.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|The Downward Spiral has always been one of \\"those\\" discs for me. You know the ones: if you lost your entire music collection, which albums would you start with...TDS would be in he top 25.<br /><br />Now I had heard \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"And All That Might Have Been\\" in 5.1 Dolby Surround, but neither of those compare with this jewel, in my opinion. When you read in other reviews that listeners heard things they had never heard before, this is not BS. I'd listened to the stereo version hundreds of times, but honestly this was like listening to it all for the first time. Layer upon layer of sound, unfolding out of all six speakers. Bliss...true bliss.<br /><br />Some of the highlights for me: The surround effects on \\"Closer\\" are spectacular. You can tell that a lot of thought and care went into putting the right sound, at the right speaker, at the right time. It was certainly done by an artist and not an opportunist.  And the multiple melody layering in \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was very impressive too; There is a melodic separation that is not very distinct on the previous versions. It comes through loud and clear here.<br /><br />The sounds that come and go during \\"Piggy\\" are fascinating to me. It's almost like standing on a street corner and listening to everything go by. Finally, the powerful guitar tones that are presented in \\"Heresy\\" are incredible, along with raspy screaming chorus, when contrasted against the tight synth lines.<br /><br />If you have a hot 5.1 surround system and like NIN I urge you to give this baby a spin. I'll forwarn you though: You'll expend much effort straightening all the crooked pictures in your house after cranking it up! MY STRONGEST BUY RECOMMENDATION!<br /><br />Now if only \\"The Fragile\\" were to receive this treatment...
B00063F8B2|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD.  After watching the movie, I decided I liked the sound track, so I bought it.
B00011F5DK|5.0|A very simple yet infinitely variable game for all ages.  Takes less than a minute to learn.  We have gotten several other families into it as well. <br /> <br />PS - The review by 'A Barry' below was clearly written about another game.  This one has no manual, takes no time to set up, and is very simple.  Either that, or the author has an IQ of &lt;5, or is being intentionally malicious.
6305622914|5.0|Hilarious!!!<br /><br />This movie completely caught me by surprise. Someone had recommended it to me so when I was at the movie rental store, I decided to watch it. A couple of weeks later, I bought it. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Well here we have a band that could have been the next great thing but instead did not seem to have enough creative talent to do anything other than spit out anti-american blather.  I really like these guys, this band is a great rock band, but their messages just fall short with me.   <br /> <br />The lead singer's voice is still intense but does not seem to carry the same punch that we saw on Toxicity.  The anti-war and anti-corporate messages are felt by many, however, without the wars of past or the corporations of the present, these guys would not even have a job.  Toxicity covered a lot of ground and I personally wish they would get back to that format.  Still a fan so I'll stick around and see what's coming out from them down the pipe.  With the exception of this album I like all of their other ones.
B0000A118M|5.0|Well i'm from the hip hop generation, but recently i have found myself going back to get a more full circle view of music John coltrane is the first jazz cd i have brought and wow i was truly amazed and taken back i definetly recommend this cd for all ages..
B00000IQC8|5.0|To anyone who's seen the movie, that line makes sense. <br />Of all the movie's that Kevin Smith has made, this one if by far the best. People say it's overrated, including Kevin Smith, if you caught the interviews on the Chasing Amy disc. <br />What makes this movie great? First of all, I like the fact that it was shot on a next to nothing budget. No-name actors go hand in hand with the budget. The blatant mistakes on screen don't bother me; I think that these imperfections add to the whole \\"indie film\\" experience of this movie. <br />The next thing that's great is, of course, the story. A slacker 20-something gets called early in the morning to fill in at a job he hates. But relax, he only has to work until noon.  <br />Upon getting to work, things start to go wrong, in the form of chewing gum jammed in the padlocks of the store's protective shutters. So, to assure customers that the store is open, Dante, the pseudo-protagonist of the story, makes a sign out a tarp and shoe polish. So begins his tortured day. <br />The person scheduled to work at noon doesn't show up. In fact, he leaves the state. So, Dante gets stuck working later than planned. He did have a hockey game scheduled... so on, and so on, and bad things happen to Dante. Worst synopsis ever. <br />The other really captivating thing was the dialogue. The characters in the movie seem to take the simplest things and add a new level of intelligence to it.  <br /> <br />-Can the independent contractors constructing the Death Star be considered \\"innocents\\" when the Death Star was destroyed in The Empire Strikes Back? <br /> -What counts as infidelity? <br /> -Is it ethical to simply close a store for a hockey game? <br /> <br />This is also Jay and Silent Bob's first movie. For the most part, they hang around in front of the convenience store where Dante works. The events that follow are essentially a conversation involving a Russian metal singer, lots of cursing, and the roots of Jay's ambiguous sexuality.<br /> <br />If you think this review makes the film sound terrible, you might be right. It's hard to write a review that encompasses how great this film truly is. You have to see it to know its value. So do that.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Very funny, a must see!<br /><br />This movie really does match it's title. This couple moves into this (what I think is Incredible) mansion that needs extensive work. As they live in it, it starts to really fall apart and they do all they can to try and fix it up. As the house falls apart, they as a couple, also begin to fall apart. The ending is wonderful. This movie is a comedy and partly romance. Be sure to watch it, you won't regret it!
B0000025RI|5.0|We all know that Michael Jackson is perhaps a little out there, to say the least.  Yet, don't let that detract you from listening to his craftmanship.  Syd Barrett, the original lead singer, and founder of Pink Floyd, is out there orbiting Pluto somewhere and even makes Michael Jackson seem normal.  Yet, I must have every album that Pink Floyd ever recorded in a nice collection at home and I love just about every song they made. <br />The same is true with Michael Jackson.  Don't let his personal life draw you away from at least giving his music a chance.  Especially when it comes to \\"Thriller.\\"  Besides \\"Dangerous\\", I think \\"Thriller\\" is the best album that Michael ever put out and is very energetic and upbeat.  Go ahead, throw his personal life aside and give the album a try!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I don't know anything about comparisons to older classic rock bands. My taste in music tends to be more modern and I loved this CD. It might take people some time to get used to the vocals, the long spaces of instrumentals, or the quirky latin beat in some songs.  <br /> <br />First and foremost, the guitars are excellent. That's probably the single most important part of music to me aside from the vocals, and both deliever strongly. Particularly in Roulette Dares and Eriatarka you see the band hitting on all cylinders, as well as Televators. The drummer is amazing as well and the album is put together very smoothly without sounding over-produced. <br /> <br />For those, like myself, who long for music with passion not only in the vocals but in the lyrics The Mars Volta is for you. The best song that shows this is my personal favorite, Televators. I don't suppose to try and explain what it means(or any of the songs what with the cryptic lyrics) but at a point near the end of the song there's a great vocal build up that is very captivating. A bonus is the music video you can find on Launch Yahoo. It really seems to capture the mood of the song and the animation gets a story across that's easier to comprehend. <br /> <br />Yeah, sometimes the vocals are hard to understand but then again, I really didn't need to in order to be entertained. The long parts full of sounds and instrumentals aren't bad but can probably get tedious if you aren't a patient listener. I'm just glad to see some refreshing music hit the scene in a market flooded by clone after clone. This CD, and more importantly the band, are really a hit and miss. There seems to be a great deal more people that can appreciate something that's not cookie-cutter radio rock and can understand that TMV is out to make music and enjoy themselves.
B00006L7MV|4.0|You don't have to like Linkin Park to respect the quality of this disc if you have a good surround system capable of playing true DVD-A material.  This is simply one of the best discs I've heard.  The sound is intense, the bass deep and punchy and this disc is probably one of the loudest I've heard that stays completely composed.  It is in that way exactly unlike so many modern/popular discs where the levels are pushed so high that detail falters.   <br /> <br />For anyone that's heard the CD (ok sounding in its own regard) and thought it had a lot of bass, you haven't heard anything until you hear this disc.   <br /> <br />The actual music on this disk is a redigested version of what went in to Hybrid Theory. I happen to not mind Linkin Park during long trips on the road or the occaisional episode of making sure everyone in the neighborhood is awake and this is the best disc for that.   <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of rap, and some of the songs on this just drift over the line for me but overall I love playing this disc, particularly to show off the surround system or introduce someone to DVD-Audio.  It is a bit of a stretch outside of my normal listening preferences but I have to say no DVD-A collection would be complete without it.  I'd give it a 4.5 stars if I could, overall the presentation and quality is phenomenal.  My only complaint is the \\"rappyness\\" of some of it.  The music and the music enjoyment factor are a solid 4 for me (even though I'm a rock, jazz and classical guy) and the disc is most definitely a five in terms of audio quality.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Cry Baby Review...<br /><br />Though this movie has been silently looked over by most of the general public, it is a wonderful gem of a film. John Waters managed to make two great musical comedies from around the period of 1988-1990 - Cry Baby and Hairspray. I first watched both movies when I was 4 years old (this was probably right when the movies were released to video sometime in 1990 or 1991) and now I'm 20 and still love them. I remember going to a party when I was 4 and met Ricki Lake. My mom told me that I followed Ricki Lake around the whole party talking about Cry Baby and Hairspray, and she was very surprised and thought it was cute at the same time. It's cool to read that other kids (even younger than me) have taken a liking to this great film. I can't believe it's now on dvd.. I had no idea until just before writing this review! Hooray!<br /><br />Also Recommended: Hairspray, Serial Mom
B0001FR3IG|3.0|Gothika was a fairly good movie . . . however,I don't believe that any new territory was charted.  The spookiness of the movie was much like \\"Sixth Sense\\" while other parts reminded me of 8MM, What Lies Beneath, and CSI episodes.  Berry plays her character well, but Cruz steals the show.  She is compellingly creepy, and I wish that the plot could have involved her more.  Overall, this is a decent movie to rent, but too un-original to actually purchase.
0394400267|5.0|This is a strange, bewildering, impossible work that bears witness to where history, psychology and science fiction intersect.  Tuchman's narrative has tragicomedy on every side; plague infested rats become the unknown agents of God's retribution in harness with a perpetual Hundred Years War, waged with suicidal stubbornness by a chivalric order whose ideology is as divorced from reality as the porous, schism ridden Church.  This headlong flight into annihilation becomes piteously lamentable as the dearth of workable souls and oscillating warfare turns a bountiful landscape into a petrified, sterile western front of lunar proportions.  All this in perplexing juxtaposition of a continuously inspiring culture; as though the human dynamic is so great it is unable to maintain any balance.  This is a stunning masterpiece we are very fortunate to have!
0783227434|5.0|SHOP SMART SHOP S-MART AND BUY THIS MOVIE *smiling*<br /><br />This is just a brilliant movie!!! Bruce Campbell is a brilliant actor and he shows it in this film!!! Im not begging you i am telling you, go buy this movie on dvd (and if not on DVD then on VHS) BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME<br /><br />Also Recommended: Beetlejuice, Evil dead 2, the shining.
0743424425|5.0|...and that is something that's very hard to come by these days.<br /><br />I was one of those people that was cheated out of the whole pie if you will by just seeing the movie. I watched \\"The Shining\\" on my couch alone in 1994. Needless to say, I had to sleep with the lights on afterwards!<br /><br />I just recently married and my husband had the book and highly recommended it saying that it was much more in depth that the movie...he was right!<br /><br />This book was hardly neglected or put down. I didn't want to clean, make dinner or go to sleep!<br /><br />King has a strange and powerful way of climbing into one's mind and bringing out your worst fears. In this instance, that person's mind is Jack's. Our main character(with checkered past and all) finds himself, wife Wendy and son Danny basically trapped in a huge, disturbingly haunted and decrepit hotel.<br /><br />What starts off as a fresh start and career for our ex teacher Jack, turns into a living nightmare and steady decent into madness. Jack's son, five year-old Danny has the psychic ability to sense this and see all of the hotel's wayward evil  spirits as well. This is what the hotel chef revealed to him as \\"the shine', hence the title. The chef also has the ability to \\"shine\\".<br /><br />The storyline is thrilling and the character development flawless. This book was chilling and an extremely fast read for me. One of King's masterpieces!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Between the fascinating making of, where the magic is demystified, and the added scenes that brings the faithful rendering even closer to the spirit of JRR Tolkien, this was the best purchase I have made in years. I asked for the three platinum edition LOR box sets for Christmas, when I did not get them I bought them myself (in a fit of uncharecteristic indulgence). <br /> In taking the production apart in the making discs, I was given a new respect and deeper awe of how the films were crafted from conception to cutting room.  The ingenuity of P Jackson and his team astounded me.  In Fellowship, you must see how the troll scene was planned out(it was completely digitized, and put in a 3d simulation, so Peter Jackson could walk around an empty room, with virtual reality goggles on, and see and plan the camera angles -wild). I was enchanted all over again.   <br />If you are wondering what Lord of the Rings DVD to Purchase the extended version is superior to the theater version.  I would let you borrow mine, to convince you, but I do not want to part with it; it is precious to me. <br />Loved the extra scene of the Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) at the end .
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Being that i love the BBC & A&E version with Colin Firth i went in hoping that when this comes out on dvd i could add it to my dvd collection right beside my BBC & A&E version and its worthy, The pride & preduice formula & plot never gets old to me<br /><br />Fabulous Movie<br /><br />I absolutley loved this movie. I went to see it in the theatre and would have gone one more time, but unfortuantely it went out of theatres. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD on Feb 28th. Keira Knightley is wonderful as Lizzie Bennett, and Matthew McFadyen is so yummy as Darcy. I love this movie, and if you watch it you will love it too!<br /><br />I know everyone has their own opinion but sometimes i feel like there are 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie...
B000AMPZGC|5.0|I thought the music for the film was amazing. Danny Elfman is a genius and will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br />Now, since the review is out of the way, Iwill say that I am not a regular Hot Topic shopper and I am not an overweight goth chick and I like this Soundtrack so for those people who gave the movie and soundtrack one star and say only the HT shoppers will enjoy it. Blow it out your @$$.
B000BMSU68|5.0|Take a day off with Ferris<br /><br />This movie is surely one of the funniest of the 1980s, a wonderful salute to those years just before we all have to become seriously responsible and grown up. Everybody has got to wish he has at least a little of the Ferris Bueller spirit in him. The scene with the idling car (I won't give it away) is absolutely unforgettable.
B00003CWL6|3.0|The title of this film might well have been \\"American Nightmare, the antithesis of the American Dream. I cannot understand why this  picture was considered a masterpiece. It is well crafted, but into what  category does it fall? It's not a whodunit, its  definitely not a comedy ,although there are comic bits scattered  through it. I would put it in the black  melodrama category myself, though  a Shakespearean  type of tragedy might  be a more appropriate description. Supposedly it is a satire on suburban middle class life, with all the usual clich&eacute;s about  material well-being not bringing happiness, and as portrayed in the film it seems to bring about the opposite results.  Imagine, indeed, if you were a rural Ethiopian, for example, watching this movie, you would be totally confused, you would wonder that with all the portrayed wealth and opportunities how  can  the characters be so fatally unhappy? The characters  portrayed have extremely ugly personalities, with the exception of the two male homosexuals in the community (three if you count the man next door who won't admit his homophilia),  but who only have a reflecting role in the film anyway. Admittedly the acting is superb, though I preferred Kevin Spacey in his role in the much superior and sensitive \\"Shipping News\\" movie.<br /><br />Essentially, \\"American Beauty\\" shows a married  couple in the prime of their  lives who have convinced themselves that they are losers. What makes the  film worth watching  is how the main characters  react in different ways  to their assumed situation.  Indeed,  most of the  grown up people in the movie appear to be  psychopaths. Naturally, the children  of these psychos are mixed up in various degrees as well. If the play  is supposed to be anything like  a true portrait of the average white  middle class family in the United States then,  God Save America!
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|Thompson's first album with wife Linda listed as a full partner, \\"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\\" remains one of his best albums. From the stunning opening track \\"When I Get to the Border\\" it was clear that Thompson found a perfect partner to harmonize with. Linda's clear, crisp voice accented Richard's gruffer one. Linda sings \\"Has He Got a Friend for Me\\" with just the right mournful tone and perfectly captures the mood of the song. The remastering on this edition is quite good. We get lyrics and a brief essay on their musical partnership during this time.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are all terrific but they do spoil the mood of the album. The first one is the title track played live and it begins right after \\"The Great Valerio\\". I'm not sure who sequenced these tracks for remastering but they should have had at least 30 seconds between the last track and the beginning of the bonus material. \\"Together Again\\" also recorded live is a terrific performance but the keeper here is \\"The Calvary Cross\\" with a blistering performance by Thompson on guitar. All three tracks are previously unreleased.<br /><br />If you purchased this album previously on CD (or vinyl) it's worth the upgrade for the bonus tracks.
B00005JKG7|3.0|Here's a great story with a cool looking fog effect. The acting and directing are gtreat in this film, but it just moves along too slowly, and it felt a little predictable. The cinematography is outstanding and the eeriness of the fog encroaching on land is captured very well. Overall a nice suspense film with little gore, but some very classic imagery.<br /><br />Check out \\"The Thing\\"... another of Carpenter's great horror films.
B00003CWPL|5.0|this is a great packaging of *eraserhead*. the radiator lady on the back, little weird baby on the DVD face. and the transfer's terrific, with great sound. the featurette is great, too. and then beyond the packaging and whatnot, beyond the fact that it took way too long to get a proper DVD release, this is a great film, eminently rewatchable, especially for parents-to-be.
B000005AYM|1.0|nothing to write home about.  Lot of rap style rifts but nothing that challenged her vocally.
0553382179|3.0|I use Cilley's methods and it's made a tremendous difference -- that woman really knows how to keep a house.  You just have to be willing to overlook all the gushing about \\"God breezes\\" and \\"purple puddles\\" and how nothin' says lovin' like a clean toilet.  I get the impression Cilley lives in a world that's so deeply Christian-Mom that she really doesn't know other kinds of people clean their houses.  I know people call her on the subject, and I don't know whether this \\"clean your house with Jesus power\\" thing persists because she really doesn't know how to break out of it, or because she doesn't want to recognize a world where men clean houses, women have reasonably egalitarian marriages and interests that rival home and family, and non-Christians walk the earth.
0887307280|5.0|I have an existing business but wanted to figure out how to get to the next level.  This book has put things into perspective and taught me things I hadn't uncovered anywhere else.  Excellent book!
B00082IJ08|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.  I've listened to it probably a dozen times, and I'm well past the initial \\"this is better than I expected\\" feelings.  Regardless of my expectations, this is a really good album.  Great, even.    Produced by the incredible DJ Danger Mouse, Demon Days is full of sonic delights at every turn.  On top of that, there is a lot of very solid hip-hop, some electronic dance influence, and even a spoken-word reading from Dennis Hopper that recalls Charles Mingus' \\"The Clown\\".  For all of those bells and whistles, however, there is something at its heart that elevates this album beyond a fun curiosity.  At its very core, Demon Days is the greatest Kink's album never written by the Kinks.    The song-writing here is terrific.  I thought that the first album was nice, but very uneven.  There is no such concern with Demon Days, however.  For all 15 tracks, you are captivated.  There is no point where you can predict what is coming next, nor would you even attempt to.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00005JCAA|5.0|i only watched this because i was pushed into it. But it was a great movie. I loved the outfits and the story was sublte but fantastic. They really payed attention to all the details in this film. I truley loved the end when Joe (Brad Pitt) was looking at the fireworks. It was a true and heart-felt moment. I give this 5 stars.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|What a weird a** movie! I'm glad I did not see this movie in the movie theater like I had originally wanted to. The commercials and the trailers advertising this movie were deceiving. They should have called the movie Deception. Closer is not even close to what I expected. I thought it was going to be a relatable drama about love and adultery. Instead it was one of those artsy movies trying to parade around as a movie with depth. If I want art I'll buy a coffee table book or a painting. This movie is so unrealistic and hard to follow. Too many plot holes. Nothing but filler. And I had to fill in so many blanks myself for the movie to make any sense. Some of the dialog was laughable because no one talks like that. What a dissapointment. This movie has great actors and the subject matter was a good idea but the potential was either lost in a bad script or bad editing. There is no real character establishment so it is hard to feel any attachment to the movie. Why is the movie even called Closer? There was no closeness of any meaning displayed. <br /> <br />If you want to see a movie about love and adultery that is more realistic, than I would suggest the movie Unfaithful.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This movie was better than the original (not to take any credit away from Gene Wilder because he was amazing in the first one).  I have to say I understand the story a lot better this time around.  The first movie had several confusing parts that were explained better in this version, and the story fits better with Tim Burton's warped view as director (as the story is warped in itself).  The only criticism, which I am not alone in, is the Oompa Loompas, who were really annoying in this version.  Although the songs were very clever, I could have done without them-a cross between rap and Saturday Night Fever.  Johnny Depp does a great job as the creepy chocolate factory owner.  Charlie is less annoying in this version than in the last.  I wanted to dislike this movie because it was a remake, but I really liked it and would recommend it highly.
0440419514|5.0|If you liked Harry Potter, I assure you, this will soon beome your most loved series.  These stories are smart and beautiful and great intrigue.   <br />I loved all the books, but the last book was stunning.    Must read.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I'll admit, when I first heard John Williams was doing the score for this movie, I was a little worried. Don't misunderstand, I love his work and own a fair amount of it, but I wasn't sure how the composer who wrote scores for movies like JAWS and Indiana Jones was going to be able to convey the quiet, subtle mood of a story like Memoirs of a Geisha. Fortunately, my fears were baseless. The music is spectacular, and Williams was able to break away from his typical action movie stereotypes. There are a few parts, especially in the Fire Scene when the music sounds oddly like the Immolation Scene from Revenge of the Sith, but perhaps fire music just all sounds the same. Regardless, this music is the perfect compliment to a movie that is a true artistic accomplishment. As a fan of Arthur Golden's wonderful novel I was pleased that I found little fault with either the cinematic or musical interpertations of his work. Congratulations, John Williams, you've done it again.
0316666343|5.0|Fabulous book about a girl looking down from heaven at the lives that continue after she is murdered. I thought it sounded gory and depressing, but it was just marvelous! It was heavy at times, but also light and humorous. I'm not sure if I believe in heaven or not, but it gave me a glorious idea of what a heaven could be.
0380789019|5.0|I loved every bit of this book! I couldnt put it down. This is truely one of the best books Ive read!
B000001EC1|4.0|Being a fan who listened to Bon Jovi through the years, I have to say I love this CD!  If I could add any song(s) to it, they would be \\"Born to be my Baby\\", and \\"Livin' in Sin\\"...but for the most part it is a fun CD to crank up and sing every song to!
B000002UA5|1.0|I bet Pink Floyd wonder what they were thinking of when they came up with the studio bits on this lp. However Several Species etc etc does have its place in rock history as one of the wackiest titles ever
B00000I07R|5.0|I have to say, 'Keep the Faith' is my all time favorite Bon Jovi CD..all great songs, especially \\"Dry County\\" and \\"If I was your Mother\\"..wonderful love songs as well, such as \\"In these Arms\\", and the classic, \\"Bed of Roses\\"...you can't go wrong with 'Keep the Faith'!
B000BJS4BM|3.0|Confessions on a Dance Floor wins the prize for best album title of the year, but the music on it isn't as good. Bland arrangements weigh down the songs. The album's rhythm and soul aren't infused with enough imagination. The album that could have been could have been brilliant.  <br /> <br />Madonna and fellow producer Stuart Price ignore the opportunities that these songs give them. The songs' structures introduce bridge potions that deserve to breathe. Why not layer the music more, why not play and experiment? In \\"Sorry,\\" for instance, the rhythms that underlay the song should be brought to the fore as the song progresses. Instead, the excellent second set of foreign-language apologies leads only to a repetition of lyrics, and then we're into the next song. To borrow a line from an Abba song, Madonna should let the music speak.   <br /> <br />What would other divas do? Donna Summer, with her Giorgio Moroder/Pete Bellotte production team, always knew how to incorporate an extended, ethereal instrumental break. These sometimes unexpected breaks, such as the calypso groove in \\"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It,\\" work organically. They reference the songs' rhythmic themes and complement vocals and lyrics. Kylie Minogue is becoming equally adept at such experimentation-check out the audacious, breathtaking layers in her song \\"Burning Up.\\" The recent work of numerous other dance/pop divas, from usual suspects like Janet and Britney, to unexpected ones like Stefani, has featured experimental grooves, combinations, elements. \\"Isaac,\\" while not a great track, is a step in the right direction. It uses a fantastic time change; the rhythms in it gradually slow to what is almost a stopping point.  <br /> <br />Confessions should have followed up on \\"Erotica,\\" \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Music,\\" or Madonna's debut album. Tracks like \\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" \\"Sky Fits Heaven,\\" and \\"Impressive Instant\\" point the way. Is \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" all there is to future disco?    <br /> <br />Two more complaints, and then on to more positive things. First, the vocal mixing often seems muddy. Second, I don't give a fig for Madonna's reflections on her fame (\\"How High,\\" \\"Let it Will Be\\"). These are the kinds of silly, downbeat tracks that ruined \\"American Life.\\" Whatever their individual strengths, they don't belong on the same album as \\"Hung Up,\\" with its good-times vibe. Tracks that featured a sense of euphoria and affirmation would have been better choices.   <br /> <br />These things said, the album contains some glorious stuff. \\"Get Together\\" is excellent, spacious and throbbing and heart-wrenchingly sung. The lyrics are \\"Holiday\\" gone metaphysical. \\"Push\\" is one of the best songs Madonna's ever recorded. The brooding eurodisco of \\"Forbidden Love\\" is, to my mind, a form of bliss. I like the attitude expressed on tracks like \\"Jump,\\" \\"Like It or Not,\\" and \\"I Love New York.\\" I adore the campy, dominatrix word-speak of \\"Future Lovers.\\" She can tell me about love anytime. \\"Justify my Love,\\" anyone?   <br /> <br />The special edition packing gives Madonna the best album packaging of her career.  Steven Klein's photographs find Madonna strong, beautiful, and flamboyant. The album's photographs, color scheme, glossy page textures, and design make for pieces of art. The diary is fun, but, unfortunately, a bit useless and cloying-really, who's going to write in anything remotely touched by Madonna's hand? Instead of the diary, I would prefer a separate CD of remixes and non-album tracks. \\"Fighting Spirit,\\" not included on the original album release, gives \\"Confessions\\" a sense of completion, but, once again, we're back to issue of arrangements, because it begs to be extended, and that never happens.   <br /> <br />It's time for Madonna to go for broke again, because she's so often brilliant when she does. A Madonna album called \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" should be magnificent. It should define; it should make sparks fly and worlds turn; it should create a sense of cosmic ecstasy; it should be the best of the best. It doesn't and it isn't.  <br />
0060977493|5.0|I'm a little miffed at myself for always writing reviews of books I have a specific criticism of, so I'm here to make a specific compliment about this book. I loved \\"The God of Small things\\" all around, and I was, however briefly, sucked into its world. What struck me as the greatest accomplishment in this book was that it succeeded in creating and making the reader conversant in the private language of the twins. I loved the fact that the creation of the internal language of the book was sort of on the side, as opposed to central -- this reminded me of Tolkien's books as vehicles for his linguistic excursions. I further appreciated that this was the childhood language of bilingual siblings, which I could relate to. So, if you don't read the book for its universal theme, mythical qualities, interesting imagery, or cultural content, you can always choose to read it as an exploration of the ways in which childhood, bilingualism, and a strong emotional connection mold language.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This television series is special because of one thing: it is just so easy to fall in love with the characters. The credits go to Joss for being the genius writer, and to the actors/actresses for making the characteristics possible and realistic. You see, Firefly isn't about heroes. It is really not so. It's all about desire, trust, death, life, whores, pain, and mean old men. Did I mention whores?  <br />Firefly is packed with genius ideas about society and how people affect people; how people hurt people; how people love people. By the way, there are sexy ladies everywhere. I MEAN, EVERYWHERE. Trust us Browncoats; you'll love the ladies =) <br />Kudos to the BDM!!!
B000063DFN|5.0|I really can't say what has not been said before about this album.  <br /> <br />What I can say is that the price of this album is worth it - just for Rhime of the Ancient Mariner. It is an amazing track. \\"Powerslave\\" itself, is alright. I think it differs from many Iron Maiden songs, the ones I like, and is a little too hard for me.  Also, please ignore \\"Cincinnati Bengals #1 Fann\\". If you read his review, it is easy enough to notice that he isn't a fan of music. He listens, but he doesn't \\"Hear\\" it. (Yes, White Men Can't Jump).  <br /> <br /> I find.Iron Maiden is amazing because of the vocalists, and for its combination of power and thrash-like metal. I think they have a great metal voice. If you like people destroying their instruments while singing satanic lyrics with demonic voices, Iron Maiden isn't for you.
B000002B1M|5.0|The 2nd album from Nasty Nas \\"It Was Written\\" is an underrated but classic album. It is not better than Illmatic, but it is still extremely well written and put together. Comparing this album in and out with Illmatic is stupid, so I won't do it. (Even though lots of people tend to do that with every other Nas album) The storytelling skills of Nas really show on this album, tracks like \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"The Set Up\\", \\"Suspect\\", and \\"Shootouts\\" are great examples of this. Other notable tracks are \\"Street Dreams\\", \\"Watch Dem Niggas\\", Live Nigga Rap\\", and, of course, the undoubtable classic \\"If I Ruled the World.\\" I highly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop. It's one of Nas' best albums.
0307276902|5.0|Regardless if this book is not all true, its an amazing book, that deals with drug and alcohol addictions, mental health. For which I work in the field of both, and I must say I observe our clients and the actions that are described in this book, is pretty much on point, to read the struggle, hurt and pain of the people in recovery it touches me. I wish Mr. Frey would have been up front I dont think he had to make this book out to be all true. Just from his own experience or even from people he know. Two thumbs up!!. I cant wait to see if his next book is just as good.
B000002WPI|5.0|There will be no in depth long review of an album that needs no explaining to tell you how good it is. This album is among the great ones, and it falls no short of 5 stars. The most unique rap group ever in my opinion, delivered a gem with this one. Rest in peace O.D.B.
B00007M5CO|4.0|It was good.  There are so many albums like this.  This is one of the good ones.
B00004XQ83|4.0|What I like most about this album is the way it shook up the music industry _ Ricky Skaggs is said to have overheard some Nashville music execs say on the way back from the Grammys: \\"We can't let that happen again.'' It has _ Alison Krauss' Grammys this year _ but they won't listen and neither will radio of any genre. <br /> <br />It also seems to have been mislabeled a \\"bluegrass'' album. This is roots music _ gospel, what I'd call 'old timey,' blues and other basic forms of American music. Bluegrass _ as I once heard Krauss describe it _ is \\"heavy on the banjo and no drums.'' I don't consider Emmylou Harris or Gillian Welch \\"bluegrass'' artists and Krauss is certain much more than just that. Her most recent album (the Grammy winner) is a mix of a lot of things _ bluegrass, folk, pop, country and a little rock _ and she's included drums on her recordings for a decade or more. She usually leaves the bluegrass vocals to Dan Tyminski, the centerpiece of this album _ the Soggy Bottom Boys are Union Station, the rest of her band.  <br /> <br />In any case, this album didn't shake up much in conservative Nashville. Nor will Krauss and Union Station's three Grammys for country recordings over albums that probably sold five times or ten times as much. She carries on some of the tradition _ still does \\"Down to the River to Pray'' and Tyminski, who she introduces as \\"the voice of George Clooney,'' always does \\"Man of Constant Sorrow.''  <br /> <br />So the effect of \\"Oh Brother'' lingers. I hoped that this album would have changed things. I would hope that it would have forced the industry and radio of all kinds to broaden its reach. It hasn't, which is our loss.  <br /> <br />
B00004Y6O7|5.0|They never came close to matching this again with or without DLR. Just listen to Eddie's Guitar and this is DLR's Finest hour, both with Lyrics and Vocals.
B00004W50Z|5.0|I've always thought the biggest problem for The Band was that their first two albums were almost too good. Because they were among the best ever released, everything after them was downgraded. Cahoots isn't as bad as a lot of people seem to think and Northern Lights is actually a very good album. <br /> <br />But back to Stage Fright. It isn't as original or groundbreaking as the first two. But compared to almost everything released by anyone in the 35 years since this was issued, it's still an A-plus. <br /> <br />Maybe it is, as one reviewer suggests, symbolic of Robertson's frustration with Manuel's (and Danko's) substance abuse problems. That  makes it more personal and less roots-based than the first two, one reason it's been downgraded. Big Pink and The Band were groundbreaking albums. Stage Fright was similar (although much better) to a lot of albums in the early '70s. <br /> <br />In any case, I'm happy that The Band seems to be getting the respect in the 21st century that it got only sporadically during its peak years (68-72). Even though the music world ranked them with the Beatles (see Clapton's comments) I don't think any album sold more than 800,000 copies, a piddling number today. I suspect the reissues might have done close to that and I love the fact that people who weren't born during their heyday now love them. <br /> <br />One aside about this album: the title song isn't a reference to Richard or Rick. It was Robbie's problem: literally the stage fright he experienced just before The Band's debut (as The Band, not The Hawks) in San Francisco. <br />   <br /> <br />

0679422714|5.0|There is no doubt this book offer one dimension of the story, but it is still a valuable read because no single publication has offered such a voluminous and thorough insight into Mao's evil side. However, even under Chung's negative brush, the book doesn't conceal Mao's talent of forwarding thinking and military strategy. This book is indeed a heavy read, especially for a native Chinese like myself, who have read and heard stories of unimaginable suffering from past generations. For decades, Chinese people have been asking the same question: why communism triumphed over nationalism. No Americans would ever believe this: at the time, communism was a more democratic force than nationalism. The nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek was much more corrupt, who claimed to be democratic, while stealing millions for his family. Millions of peasants starved to death under Chiang's governance. Chiang's priority was to protect the super rich not the extreme poor, which was the majority of the population. Communism instead rallied around those forces. Nationalism only became true democracy after fled to Taiwan. It is a sad, sad story for Chinese people. Chang ought to write another book on Chiang Kai-shek.

0743243153|5.0|It is rare to read a book that challenges you to look at yourself critically and yet gently. Peck does a wonderful and thorough job dealing with somewhat intangible topics. This book is far from a self help book, but yet it is somewhat the epitome of self help books. There is a gentle flow towards his views, experiences and opinions of psychotherapy, mental illness and grace. The melding of an openness for mental and spiritual growth are well demonstrated by his words and examples from his practice. <br /> <br />I'm very glad I read this book. It is true that Peck expects a bit from the reader, but he should. He doesn't provide many, if any quick answers. This book truly focuses on where the mind is at, your ability and will to grow and how your openness to a larger force can help you grow. <br /> <br />Many people will be insulted or intimidated by his point of view, but those who are open to these ideas will be lifted. <br /> <br />May your path be a good one. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I generally don't like westerns from then Firefly isn't your ordinary western. Wry comedy, more plot twists than you can imagine and totally original characters from the trigger-happy Jayne to the the eternal romantic Kaylee make this series shine. Whoever decided to cancel this was seriously out of touch. Buy it, watch it, buy Serenity, watch it, join the browncoats. That's what I did.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|I just love Gilmore Girls!!!  My collection just wouldn't be complete without Season Five.
B00005JO1P|3.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is Reese Witherspoon's final ascent into movie stardom, maybe even her declaration as America's Leading Lady, seeing as Julia Roberts doesn't have much interest anymore, Gwyneth Paltrow's drifted into obscurity, Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts and Charlize Theron were born south of the equator and Renee Zellweger just isn't very good looking.  <br /> <br />Spunky, cute, self-effacing, Witherspoon's made a lot of crap (and a lot of money off it), a few gems (\\"Election,\\" \\"American Psycho\\"), and this OK biopic about Johnny and June Carter Cash that's a perfect vehicle for her talent - mixin it up with the boys, flirtin, mouthin off, cryin, lovin, hurtin. The Blue Plate Sally Field. <br /> <br />Pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played  by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married. That Cash-brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but \\"Walk The Line,\\" aims to be a love story, and succeeds. Phoenix and Witherspoon have the necessary chemistry, and Cash's first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) is slanted as such a grim, unhappy grinch it is a small joy when she orders John to take down a photo of June and walks out when he refuses. It's still several years before June agrees to marry John, but the way is finally clear. There's only a drug habit to kick and some self-abuse to endure. <br /> <br />\\"Walk The Line\\" has a backstory for all the pain - a mean father (Robert Patrick) who blames John for his brother's death, that grim wife, the drugs, the alcohol, the tours, several bad influences (which include Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis). We assume the music is written somewhere in there; we see John on stage and at Folsom Prison, but not in the studio. Maybe rightly so - Cash was revered more as the Man In Black than as a talent; unlike \\"Ray,\\" which cared about how Ray Charles created his art and survived by his business savvy, \\"Walk The Line\\" envisions Cash as little more thanthe guy who attends corporate meetings standing up, shades on, some country James Dean with the Holy Spirit bolting through him. Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man. It's all blowups, booze and romance from the gut. <br /> <br />Witherspoon does something different with June; she embodies the reluctant-yet-radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare. June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner. She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife. Who doesn't fall in love with that? That June finally falls too makes sense because John adores her.  <br /> <br />There's no mystery in Witherspoon. No hidden cards. She brings the same tomboyish, attractive skills to every movie, and for each \\"Walk The Line,\\" there is a \\"Vanity Fair,\\" where, regardless of her diligence, the magic is lacking. She's not a master talent like Meryl Streep or Kidman, but a punch-the-clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year. Audiences like her, they really like her.
B0009I7O7U|4.0|Jon Legend delivers on his name.  He has a voice similar to Stevie Wonder's but still has his own unique style.  He has a very complex vocal range and is fun to listen to.  With hip hop beats mixed with his unique singing style, you will be both singing and dancing to Jon Legend the all the way through.  This album is definately worth buying.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This is a wonderful cd. I really like this unedited version of so many well loved songs. Hearing a live version of  the music you fully appriciate the power and meaning behind the preformance.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What a WONDERFUL movie! I never really planned on seeing this movie, but now hearing all the controversy once again stirred up by all the judgmental religious hypocrites, I decided to go see it. Very glad that I did! I still prefer King Kong for Best Picture of 2005 but this is a close running second for me! I was amazed by both of these lead actors. They were both phenomenal in this movie. They made you feel every feeling that they were each feeling. Plus, I was able to relate to this because this kind of thing does happen. And I speak from experience (minus the whole cowboy theme).   Living your life not being true to your heart is such a tragedy and that is the biggest message I left this movie with. I didn't expect it to end like it did but with that, Heath Ledger was amazing! He was absolutely brilliant in this film. The whole cast of this movie did a wonderful job and I hope that Heath does bring home the Oscar. Would have been nice if his x-girlfriend Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for her brilliant work in King Kong.  Would have been neet to see them both win an Oscar on March 5th.    Well, Brokeback Mountain is a really great movie! Thank you to Ang Lee for putting it together so beautifully! Loved it!
B00005JOFO|5.0|I recall a short story version of Brokeback Mountain many years ago in a major periodical (alas, I can't recall the periodical). I had an idea that it would, in the fullness of time, become a major motion picture, and that it has. It is an award-winning film already, and looks set for some sort of Oscar recognition.  The film has garnered more Oscar nominations than any other this year.<br /><br />However, in the hype surrounding the film, those interested would be wise to look at the book. There is much more depth here than in the film, much more about the interior workings of the main characters and what they must endure. This is ultimately not a love story, as the marketing has been spinning the film, but rather an expose on the dangers and drawbacks of living in the closet. For the purposes of this story, Annie Proulx has juxtaposed two diametrically opposite cultures in the American psyche - the gay culture and the cowboy culture (although history is, as it often is, in fact rather different from what the Hollywood-created current remembrance of it is). One comes to wonder at the resistance that all characters seem to have for breaking free of their bonds; ultimately, none of the relationships are satisfying, and there is an emotional desolation as wide and spare as brush land and prairies of the American West.<br /><br />The lead characters meet while working for the summer as wranglers and watchers over herds. They form a bond that renews at regular intervals during their lives, lives that go on to other, more traditional and socially acceptable settings. Each gets married, each has children, each embarks (in one way or another) in a working life that would seem to preclude the other, but yet the tie that binds them draws them together again on a regular basis.<br /><br />The closet theme is heightened in the lead characters, but in fact serves as a metaphor for readers who might not fit in that particular closet - we all have skeletons in our closets, it seems, and in fact, we all have our own closets in which we hide and live out part of our lives.<br /><br />This theme is played in out in several scenes of the film - Ennis Del Mar finding his shirt intertwined with Jack's shirt in Jack's closet, which Ennis then proceeds to put into his own closet.<br /><br />The last scene is perhaps the most powerful of all, drifting to a final image.  Ennis' daughter, having announced her marriage plans, drives off into the dusty plain; Ennis is living in isolation in his own trailer which has next to no furniture (his daughter comments that he needs a chair); and the very final shot is of a closet door, kept closed until Ennis is alone, with a view of the mountains in the far distance just outside the window beyond.<br /><br />In terms of overall cinematography, this is a beautiful film.  Ang Lee's direction has provided wonderful panoramic views of the mountains and the plains, the not-so-wild west of America, mid-century.  This is a world very different from either coast - the trends of the cities in New England and California have little effect on life here, which goes on generation after generation with an unrelenting sameness.<br /><br />Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, fresh from his role as a marine in 'Jarhead') and Heath Ledger (whose film 'Casanova', playing at the same time in the same cinema in my town, cast him in a very different role) play the leads of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, two down-on-their-luck wranglers who get a summer job camping out with sheep herds in the mountains - the kind of 24 hour/7 day-per-week job that virtually nobody wants.  Jack is the extrovert, whereas to call Ennis an introvert might win the Oscar for understatement.  At one point, Jack points this out, after a conversation that only lasted for about a minute.<br /><br />Jack Twist: 'That's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.'<br /><br />Ennis Del Mar: 'Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.'<br /><br />Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.  Everything is said in a grumble, a low-level, low-syllable-count manner.  Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Jack as the ants-in-his-pants, high-energy bronco buster cowboy is also very enthralling.  Jack's passion for many things comes through, and through the film we come to discover (as Ennis comes to discover) that this passion comes with a high price.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams play the wives of Jack and Ennis, respectively.  Both want 'regular' lives, and both discover there is more to their husbands' relationship than fishing-buddy friendship in different ways.  In some ways, the film reminded me of another film, 'Same Time Next Year', in which a couple gets together on a regular basis while maintaining stable, family relationships elsewhere.  However, there is a price to be paid for leading such double lives, and we see this manifested in different ways in the lives of Ennis, Jack, and their wives and children.  Again, the issue of the closet comes into play.<br /><br />Of course, the big 'issue' for the film is homosexuality and homophobia.  That this takes place within the almost-sacred genre of the American Western also adds to the heightened interest - the mythology of the American cowboy being a super-macho figure has already been developed as a gay stereotype by such groups as the Village People and what sociologists might call costume-culture communities.  The unspoken secret that rarely made even a mention on Hollywood screens was that cowboys, being isolated much of the time, and in male-only communities when they did have company, almost certainly had a higher incidence of same-sex expression than we have come to believe through the mythology.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack do put physical and emotional expression to their passion and to their love for each other, but societal expectations and personal feelings (what some term internalised homophobia) work to keep them apart and leading separate (and dual) lives throughout the twenty-year span of the film.<br /><br />There is no happy ending to this film - I left the cinema with a feeling about as desolate as the dry and dusty plains shown in many of the scenes.  I found bits of the music score coming back to me for days afterwards, and each time this happened, I would feel a bit more sombre, and a little bit lost for words.  The original themes by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marcelo Zarvos are very well done, and this is a soundtrack I mean to get.<br /><br />I won't predict that it will win the best picture Oscar, but I am not surprised it is one of the odds-on favourites for winning.<br />Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.

0525948023|5.0|I'm 54 years old, and I've been an avid reader for decades.

Perhaps the most honest, understandable, transformative, and effective non-religous spiritual book ever written.
B00005JL0U|5.0|Found the DVD in Italy in January -- Why is it not out here. <br />Finally can replace my wife's very old and used VHS tape!
B00005JOM9|3.0|Though there is no doubt that the subject matter of \\"Transamerica\\" is important and contemporary and director Duncan's handling of this subject matter is very reverent, \\"Transamerica\\" is unfortunately very poorly executed and that includes the very odd, though at times touching,  performance of Felicity Huffman as the heroine, Bree (Stanley)Osbourne.<br />Bree is a woman literally at the crossroads of her life: born a man, she is just days away from  sexual re-assignment surgery when she suddenly receives a call from a young man who she shockingly realizes is her son: the result of a once in a lifetime liaison with a college friend.<br />The best, most natural performance in \\"Transamerica\\" comes from Kevin Zegers who plays Bree's son, Toby. Zegers's Toby is a psychological mess: a wounded, desperate, needy mass of exposed nerves and unresolved conflicts and Zegers throws everything he's got into this performance. Expect great things from this guy.<br />Odd yet at times touching: Huffman's Bree is both of these things...usually at the same time. A woman portraying a man in the last stages of sexual re-assignment: how do you play this role successfully? Huffman has been so good previously but she and director Duncan have just made some very bad choices in deciding how Huffman should play this role: the overall tone of the performance, the facial and body clicks and pops all add up to make Bree more strange than she really is. Bree, above all else should be warm and human and emotionally available at all times: she is an oddity, of this there is no doubt. Huffman and Duncan should have done everything that they could to humanize her. Though Huffman warms up towards the very conclusion of this film, it is Kevin Zegers who steals this movie out from under her very considerable talent.  And when the most important character in a film is not, for whatever reason, a successful creation  the film suffers and tragically sags at its core.<br /> Though I wanted to, if not love but at least appreciate \\"Transamerica,\\" under these circumstances, I just can not.reciate \\"Transamerica,\\" under these circumstances, I just can not.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Other folks have talked about the Eagles themselves and they performed great, but I want to focus on the other musicians and the production of the DVD itself.  I encourage any Eagle fan who has an audio system capable of DTS to buy this.  The audio is fantastic.  The engineering on separation of singer, musicians, and the crowd is clearly defined and a truly great listening experience.  The backup musicians are outstanding, in particular the violinist.  The brass section adds depth and meatiness to the overall presentation.  The video editing is superb too.  It focuses attention visually on important audio components.  The scenes of the crowd truly transmit what must have been an unbelievable concert.  By far, my favorite music DVD.
B0002VEWA6|5.0|For those of us who grew up in the 70s, 80s and 90s and can remember them, this is an excellent movie. The move is filled with allusions, and nuances that make you remember your childhood.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I would not consider myself a country fan, certainly not the \\"18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses\\" brand anyway, but I have yet to come across a cd that captures the energy of a live performance like this one does. Cash's lively banter with his prison audience is not edited out, even when they interrupt his songs. After a blistering opening number with Folsom Prison Blues, which goes down a storm, Cash launches into \\"Busted\\" before slowing things down with \\"Dark as a Dungeon\\". This alternating of pace, hyping his audience up and then bringing them down with a ballad or comic number just as things reach boiling point is something unique to Cash's prison albums and that is clearly tangible on At Folsom Prison. The album stands as a complete work, but highlights definitely include \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"Jackson\\", \\"I Got Stripes\\" and the haunting finale. I like how after \\"Green green grass of home\\" the tape is left running and we hear, for a few seconds, the inmates being directed back to their cells and the shuffling grumble of the men. It gives a real sense of what it must have been like for these guys to have the daily grind punctuated by a visit from the Man in Black.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you are person with one ounce of imagination, this collection will entertain you for days. Not only do you have the original theatrical releases, but personalized \\"Director's Cut\\" movies are also included, with each DC having a personal prologue from Ridley Scott, and digitally \\"cleaned up\\" to reveal additional background detail. It was like seeing the movie again for the first time. Now I know what the dark parts of the ships look like.The THX sound is awesome too.  When you consider all the dvd bonus material and the dynamite package design (you get a cool little book inside), I think anyone who decides to go with it will be satisfied.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My little sister got me hooked on this when some of the girls in her chorus class introduced her to it.  She would come home singing these songs which would then get stuck in my head.  I just had to get the soundtrack.  Oh my goodness.  Amazing! The music is fun to dance and act along with!  I know this is a lame review but seriously this soundtrack rocks my goofy socks off!
1559409010|5.0|I think this is the best of the Monty Python movies, although I love them all.  This edition has lots of extra features, like a documentary on the Monty Python guys made during the filming of this movie - I learned lots of things I didn't know about them.  Overall I couldn't be happier.
0307276902|3.0|It was written well but I experienced a huge disappointment in the midst of my reading when I discovered it to have a breach of authenticity. You can request me to focus my comments on the product but my experience was greatly altered when the truth which what I believed to be reading became an entirely different truth before the book end. This is the truth for me. <br /> <br />I was anxious to read the book because of it's powerful content. Alcohol and drug addiction already carries with it unbelievable life altering situations that take people to the lowest and loniest of lows. It needs NO fabrication. Addiction is already beyond anything that we would want to believe possible for human beings to suffer through. <br /> <br />I would recommend it as a great read with some valuable lessons. Due to all of the exposure about it's authenticity just reassign it's catagory within your mind and it will again read well.
B0001AP158|1.0|I'm also very disappointed with this DVD. I just recently went to the DC show for the \\"Have a nice day\\" tour and was also very disappointed with the show. I don't like the new versions of the songs. The reason I love Bon Jovi is because of their jammin' energetic songs. When they changed those songs, it's almost like we lost the band. Even the \\"Everyday with Bon Jovi\\" segment of the DVD was boring. All the guys looked as if they didn't want to be there, except Richie. He was the only one that looked like he was having a good time. I simply didn't like the DVD, and I don't recommend it.
B00005JOFO|3.0|This movie began looking like a well made piece of cinema, excellent soundtrack, beautiful scenery, fine acting, especially the opening piece with Randy Quaid, no comedy in this part but played convincingly well.  Then all of a sudden, the \\"shocker\\", okay they're gay (even though laughingly enough you do get to hear the line \\"I ain't no queer\\"). <br /> <br />    I wouldn't think it was necessary to validate ones own opinion of this film based on the subject matter.  I have no problem with homosexuality, although I've seen movies that are 10 times better that deal with the subject.  This movie simply had no depth of characters.  I followed the slow but all too \\"choppy\\" time line of events but none of the scenes seemed to validate the the story, each scene was so short that nothing seemed to have much believabilty, just bits of story line thrown in to represent the passing of time, not the best of writing, so I guess I disagree with all the \\"knowledgable reviewers\\".   <br /> <br />  I expected a great deal more from this film and I'm really sorry it didn't deliver.  The acting was very good, I just didn't see any real charisma going on between the two main characters and everyone else just seemed to be thrown into the mix at will. <br /> <br />  In order for a screen play to have validity I need to see characters that have some sort of depth.  Heath Ledgers daughters grow up during this film but you only see brief glimpses of them as time passes, one day he meets one in a diner, the scene lasts all of about two minutes, next she is  <br />telling him she is getting married, all of another 2 minute scene.  We're left to wonder if the other daughter stopped exsisting or was forgotten by the script master or what, but most reviewers won't mention that, they're too busy praising the filmakers for taking on such a controversial subject. <br /> <br />  Parts of this film reminded me of a \\"made for TV\\" movie depicting the life story of some forgotten celebrity.  Most ofthe story line just seems to be \\"tossed in\\" to show the passing of time, very sloppy writing in my opinion, although a fine screen play may have saved this story. <br /> <br />   Even between the 2 main characters the story line is weak.  Their \\"romantic\\" scenes seem totally out of character.  Perhaps this is to envoke a feeling of shock in the viewers but it only added to the lack of depth.  Maybe this is \\"Cowboy love\\" but it just seems odd to me that these two rough and tough cowboys that barely talk to one another are immediately caught up in an uncontrollable passion, am I the only one that finds this hard to swallow.  <br /> <br />   After viewing a film and determining its value I take into consideration 2 basic things, \\"Would I see it again?\\" no, \\"What was memorable about it?\\" nothing. <br /> <br />
B00005KHJR|4.0|At least one previous reviewer has referred to the \\"gratuitous nudity\\" of this film and I just want to say that nothing could be farther from the truth. The nudity in this film is anything but gratuitous; the theme and the plot quite obviously require it. (Nor have I seen any J-lo look-alikes, fyi. To say that, only reflects the warped aesthetics of our days, if you know what I mean.) <br /> <br />On another note, I would say that this film is not particularly about paganism. The more important theme seems to be FANATICISM, here illustrated by a Christian zealot and a community of pagans that happen to be every bit as obtuse as he is.  <br /> <br />Seen as a sort of fable, the film works very well. The best parts are the musical scenes.
0553801503|5.0|If you are considering reading the fourth book of this series, you obviously enjoy Martin's writing enough to slog through the 2600+ pages of the first three 'Song of Ice and Fire' tomes. This book continues the series well and will satisfy most fans of the series. I did get the impression that Martin was writing with diminished enthusiasm though, moving the story along to lay the foundations for future events.<br /><br />I will focus on the areas I found imperfect in this book.<br /><br />1. Martin neglected to mention many of the characters from previous books. Martin explains this decision, and, as much I want to read about Bran's adventures beyond the wall, I understand the decision. This is NOT a problem.<br /><br />2. The plot focuses on Brienne far too much. In my opinion, the Maid of Tarth is a fine ancillary character, but Martin never creates enough depth of personality for her to be a main character. Others may disagree. On this topic, I think Martin really did a disservice to Cersei in this novel. She was always bitter and headstrong, but she seems to have become much less intelligent in this novel. In general more time is spent on Jaime and Cersei than I would have preferred.<br /><br />3. Much time is spent in Dorne with Martells and their court. Martin does well with creating the setting of Dorne, but he does not distinguish the multitude of new characters well enough. On numerous occasions I found myself pausing to remember who character X is related to or conflating characters' backgrounds. I never had to do this with the first three novels.<br /><br />4. Unlike previous books, Martin often refers to people by aliases or titles, instead of their real names. I understand his intention at times, but overall I find the practice tiresome and gimmicky. It's not a big deal, but I don't like it.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|I've had Demi-god for a while now and I haven't really been able to get into it. After listening to it, it leaves me wanting something more... As others may have mentioned, behemoth screwed around with Nergals vocals, recording a low-pitch track, and then playing another, higher pitched vocal track \\"underneath\\" the normal vocals.- the only track which doesn't seem to use this method is \\"before the aeons came\\" which seems to be more reminiscent of behemoth's older, more minimal death vocal style. This new production method makes the vocals uninteresting and lack-luster. No where on demi-god will a certain scream or growl stand out, they end up being like death metal spoken word.<br /><br />Behemoth seems to borrow quite a bit from the well-known american death metal act Nile. The most noticeable being In the solo section. But this dosen't bother me very much because the solos are absolutely amazing solos, some of the best I have heard in a long while in fact. Other times its harder to pin down.. Its not really a big deal, behemoth obviously has been influenced by Nile. being influenced by a band is fine; just as long as they don't turn into Nile Junior. They even have a Guest apperance on Xul by none other then Karl Sanders, Nile's guitarist and Mastermind.<br /><br />I have the same problem with the lyrics as I do with all their other albums, I don't know anything about them, im not fammiliar to what it is they are trying to portray through the lyrics, Since most of them seem to written on old mythology from mayan to egyptian. now this would be O.K. if they came with a big discription of what the names...but the descriptions provided don't really shed much light onto the deeper meanings of the lyrics. So I had to bash up Wikipedia to find out what some things meant, i.e. Shemyaza, Dumuzi Lord, and the like. I will however give them credit for making unique and original lyrics. If you are into the hole occult/etc thing I supposed you will understand these lyrics perfectly...I guess i am just a stupid vn-Kvltish mortal. Anyway, the only song I like lyricly is \\"Before the Aeons came\\", and behemoth didn't even write this, it was written by an old english poet.(Algernon Charles Swinburne for anyone who cares =P)<br /><br />This \\"new\\" beefier sound with dual vocal distortians can work work out extremely well. Like in Slaves Shall serve, Mysterium Coniunctionis (Hermanubis), Conquer all(I am obsessed with this song, it has a great death metal vibe/groove to it), Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth, and The Reign Of Shemsu-Hor. All of these tracks prove behemoth can be crushingly heavy when they want to be. While some other times, it can be a less intense and more average death metal, like in Xul, and the Nephilim Rising.<br /><br />In the end I like this record, but I think it could have been so much more. Not to say its bad, it definitely has its moments. I don't regret buying this album one bit. Is it one of my all time favorites? No, Is it the worst thing to ever come from death metal? Hell no! Its another solid album from behemoth, who in case you haven't noticed, have been spewing out tons of quality records recently. Im gonna keep my eyes open for the next album from behemoth, hoping that they will take what they did with \\"Demigod\\" even further. To end this review i'll say that if you like Nile, or death metal at all, you should pick this up because  you will most likely love this record.<br /><br />If you managed to read this entire review, and didn't feel like kicking me in the teeth after doing so, or found it remotely interesting, appealing, or helpful please take a second out of your busy and important day to press the \\"yes\\" button next to \\"Was this review helpful to you?\\"<br />Thank you,<br />-Igar the Terriblei am just a stupid vn-Kvltish mortal.

B000092Q8K|5.0|Hey, Bill Bennett, if you have a crappy sound system all you are going to hear is just that, no matter what music you are playing. My system is based around the $6000 Denon AVR-5805 with Polk speakers at $2000 each, believe me when I say, you are blowing smoke out your butt. This disc sounds incredible.
0670034711|5.0|Life's too short. <br />Do you have the guts/courage to just pick up and leave? <br />To sell all your possessions, put the rest of the stuff in storage, quit your job and move half way around the world for a change of pace? <br />Well, even if you don't, you can live vicariously through Elizabeth Gilbert's life. <br />I read a LOT of books.  And I can honestly say this was so refreshing. <br /> <br />It is so well-written and you really get caught up in her adventure. <br />She depicts situations, different circumstances and scenes with such vivid imagery and honesty, you can't help but fall in love with the story and her writing. <br />GREAT BOOK. <br /> <br />Everyone, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, etc will love this book. <br />guaranteed. <br /> <br />I'm a fan now and can't wait to read her other books!
0671027387|5.0|Until now, I'd never read any of Dan Brown's books until I picked up this one on a friend's recommendation. This is just a superb read - a very suspenseful and action-packed political scientific thriller which seems in part to be influenced by 1978 conspiracy movie CAPRICORN ONE, which was way ahead of its time! Though this story is Earth-bound in a different way . . . an ailing NASA and their scientists make an amazing discovery in the remote Milne ice shelf in the Arctic. Rachel Sexton, a brilliant young NRO officer is sent by the President to investigate. She teams up with TV celebrity Michael Tolland who's thrown his life into his shows about exploration. Together they learn startling facts about a meteorite found in an ice floe, but is it all it seems to be? When members of the NASA team begin to die in mysterious circumstances, it seems they are being watched. Why is a covert Delta Force squad, using the latest weapons and spy gadgets so interested in the meteorite's discovery? Why is Rachel's overbearing father keen to exploit the situation using any means necessary to interfere? Why is Rachel's father, a Presidental candidate, so keen to exploit the situation? YOu'll have to read it to find out, but all in all if you're a thriller aficionado, this is a must have! The narative is straight and to the point making a Clancy-esque story shorter, condensing it into hald the amount of pages.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, I don't know what my state of mind was during the fall of 2002, but I didn't watch \\"Firefly\\" when it aired on Fox.  I must have been out of my freakin mind because this was one of the best television shows ever made. <br /> <br />This revelation only recently occurred when I rented \\"Serenity\\" and immediately fell in love with the Firefly universe.  The next day, \\"Serenity\\" AND \\"Firefly\\" joined my DVD library and I devoured the entire series in about a day and a half (then promptly re-watched Serenity for the inevitable re-appreciation of the movie). <br /> <br />Great characters, hilarious dialogue, and a realistic & well thought-out \\"future\\" are just some of the elements that make this show really work.   <br /> <br />Buy it, buy the movie, and spread the word!  This show needs to be back on the air!
B000000W5B|5.0|I saw the Stones perform at The Garden (Madison Square Garden, in NYC), when this album came out.<br /><br />They performed most of the new songs and that experience will stay with me till I die. I'm not as thrilled with A BIGGER BANG, although I do agree with its political messages 100%. I took my daughter, who wasn't born the last time to see the stones for the BIGGER BANG tour, maybe she will write her rave review about BIGGER BANG re-release in 30 years!<br /><br />Buy Goats Head Soup if you are Stones fan, especially if you like what they did in the 70s!<br /><br />My favorites from this Album? 1) ANGIE, 2) DOO DOO, DANCING WITH MY D, 3) STAR STAR<br /><br />The song STARf***** or Star Star as the album reads inspired me to paint stars on my GTO back then.<br /><br />Just buy Goats Head Soup already. You wouldn't have read all this if weren't a Stones / 70s fan!
B00003CXA4|5.0|The DVD quality was excellent.  I showed this to a World Cultures class of 10th grade students and it was spellbinding for them after they got used to the fact that it wasn't an action-packed thriller!  The impact of the story is timeless.
B0006399FS|4.0|I don't usually post reviews or make comments on message boards but I felt it was the least I could do for my #1 favorite band of all time.  After all, they have provided me with so many fond memories and experiences. <br /> <br />Before I start, I want to say that any new fan of U2, should try to buy these albums in this order (though nothing says that you cannot buy How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb first--it has already become a 5 Grammy award winning classic): <br /> <br />1-Joshua Tree, 2-U2: Rattle
B0000AUHOH|4.0|\\"God D#@* Irresponsible!  Playing games with life...\\"  The look on his face as he utters this line is priceless. 'Nuff said.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril can sing. She writes her own songs. She does not lip-synch. She has never purposely TRIED to rip off her fellow singers. She hasn't done anything, as far as I can see, that would qualify her to be a \\"slut.\\" <br /> <br />Seriously, I get that people don't think Avril is as good as U2. Well, guess what? I AGREE WITH THAT! Avril is a girl-power idol from the 21st century, not a classic rock band from the 80's. No one asked her to be like U2. She doesn't have to be like U2 to be good. <br /> <br />And as for \\"Avril will never be as good as Green Day,\\" I just want to say one thing: STOP COMPARING AVRIL TO GREEN DAY!!!!! Avril Lavigne=Green Day? NO WAY!!! Avril covered a Green Day song for one of her live tour shows. I heard the original version, and I liked both versions. As much as I strongly dislike Billie Joe Armstrong, I have to admit that he can at least play the guitar. <br /> <br />Which brings me to another point. Avril can also play the guitar. AND the piano, AND the drums. Can Raven-Symone, Jessica Simpson, or Usher play all three of those instruments? I DON'T THINK SO! So even if Avril isn't perfect, at least she's better than some of the other \\"artists\\" out there who are getting on MTV and the NOW CDs.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I was sitting at work and home, listening to a playlist of all the work of Dilla's that I have and reminiscing over the good times I had with that music in my life.I went over to one of my favorite websites and they were talking about their review of this album, and it literally made me \\"HAVE\\" to buy it.   <br /> <br />I'm not upset in the least way that I purchased this album.  Dilla wasn't my \\"favorite\\" producer.  To tell the truth, there were times that his beats became a little too repetitive for my tastes, but they always had a very interesting sound and soulful touch to them that also made them infectious. <br /> <br />This album is amazing.  It plays through as a musical opus and it does seem to sound a bit like Dilla knew of his very real mortality and as if he wanted to put this out as \\"his defining work\\".  It is perfect as a definition of Dilla's work.  The songs are all short, and don't allow for you to \\"get sick\\" of a beat, instead, they seem to flow into each other beautifully, and if you play the album on repeat, you won't know when it begins or ends.  <br /> <br />This ranks as one of my two favorite Instrumental Albums of all time, along with Prince Paul's Itstrumental.  It's just good...  Buy it. <br /> <br />Besides that, RIP Dilla.  Thank you for being such positive musical influence on my life.
B000002HEP|5.0|On the inside of the CD jacket there is a quiet suggestion that says something to the effect of \\"listen without distraction\\". When I first heard this album nearly ten years ago, I sat down to give it a try, and as \\"Gardenia\\" began to build I found myself slipping away into a familiar state of ultra peaceful contentedness that I rarely get with albums anymore.  Even though I had never heard this album before that moment, it felt like I had been listening for years. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" is a 1994 release from Kyuss, a united effort by John Garcia (later singer for Slo Burn and Unida), Josh Homme (yes, QOTSA Josh Homme), Nick Oliveri (also in QOTSA) and Brant Bjork. Kyuss is raw in a simple (and beautiful) way. Many bands have a distinguishing characteristic that separates them from others, usually a single item that makes them stand out. *Everything* about Kyuss stands out. They are (were) a raw, rockin, metal, jamming kind of band that blends many styles seamlessly into something new. Gardenia, for instance, breaks out into a 2+ minute jam where Josh Homme overlays two tracks of wah with his guitar, one to keep rythm, the other to harmonize. With judicious use of his ride cymbals, Bjork keeps a continuous thread of heavy drumming which weaves it all together.   <br /> <br />One thing that stands out about Kyuss is the low, gritty, gain-all-the-way-up-on-a-tube-amp sound of Josh Homme's guitar. \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" is a bit more refined than the powerful \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\", but the often drop-D tuned melody is still there, a modern shadow of Black Sabbath, except better (?). A bold claim, I know... but possibly true. Rumor has it that Homme played his guitar through a bass amp to get that sound. I learned guitar while alternating between Zeppelin and Kyuss, and one thing I picked up fast was Homme's technique of using the low octaves of the key to add space to the sound. Playing \\"E\\" in the seventh fret while resonating the open \\"E\\" on the low string adds much more to the chord than simply playing an \\"E\\" chord in the second fret, and this simple techinque is the basis for much of Kyuss' sound.  <br /> <br />Throwing Kyuss into the CD player never disappoints. I especially enjoy it while driving (fast).
0743424425|5.0|As always, the movie is better than the book(even if the movie is still good). Stephen King's The Shining easily ranks among his best. Right up there with It and The Pet Cemetery. The Shining also ranks among the scariest books of all time! 2nd only to The Exorcist in my opinion. The book is filled with tension and to put it down would seem to be an impossible task. Jack's son, Danny,  seems to be more affected by the house's evil than Jack in my opinion(in MY opinion); as he goes insane and feels as though there is someone inside of him: controlling him. And if things aren't bad enough for him, Danny sees horrible images like the room full of blood and the 2 little girls that were butchered in the hotel some time ago. The part of The Shining that REALLY sends chills down my spine is when Danny's mother is telling Jack that a woman in a bathromm was attacking Danny and tried to kill him. Jack later encounters this woman who disguises herself as a hot, young woman but turns into an old, decaying woman.  Danny's mother, Wendy, is wrapped up in all of the insanity and seems to be the real victim here. And poor Jack, trying to find some entertainment, is convinced by evil spirits that the only way to find happiness is by murdering his family.<br /><br /> This book convinced me that King was the master of horror books. He stands as tall as Wes Craven, the master of horror movies, in terms of scaring the hell out of people. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to any of Stephen's fans. If you're not a fan of Stephen King... I reccomend it anyway!
B000002HJA|5.0|When this album was first released it seemed as if it was missing an unknown ingredient that is found in \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" and \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\". As the years passed I found that I would grab one of the other two albums before I would grab this one (never mind \\"Wretch\\" - that album is more of a trophy for Kyuss collectors than anything else, not as good as the others, but still a keepsake). Not that this album isn't good... it's amazing... just different than the others. Perhaps there is a sense that the band is on its way out, perhaps the unity that was in the other albums doesn't come out of the music like it once did. It's hard to place.  <br /> <br />And then a few years ago I popped this CD into my car stereo one morning... and left it there for weeks. I listened to it every time I was in the car, enough that people started to notice. It was just too good to take it out. It was one of those great moments when I \\"rediscover\\" a CD from my collection, when I remind myself how cool an album is.  <br /> <br />This album takes everything that the members of Kyuss built over the previous albums and puts a 400 grit sandpaper polish on it. It's not shiny, but for Kyuss, it's polished, where they are taking on a dull sheen that comes with exposure and experience. Josh Homme has learned a lot by this album, exploring more of the guitar neck than he had in the past. Like other albums, Homme still uses the technique of layering octaves over one another to create depth in the sound, but he has acquired more courage to use the higher notes, the frets above number 7 and the strings lighter than .032 gauge. Homme never attempts wailing solos, probably because he doesn't like them (he tried on \\"Wretch\\", but he was young and inexperienced then).  <br /> <br />The instruments don't blend together as much as they do on other albums, meaning that the mixing is perhaps cleaner than before. Each track is more distinguishable. \\"Phototropic\\" is a reminder of what Kyuss can do, a 5 minute studio jam of octaves layered on one another, blending in and out of melody and heavy rocking, and Garcia's vocals don't start until half way through the song. It is a beautiful thing. <br /> <br />\\"El Rodeo\\" is definitely one of my favorite songs. I remember my freshmen year of college, listening to this album in my dorm room and picking out the touch of Spanish guitar in the lead riff. When I finally nailed it, it wasn't hard to pick up the rest, and then I kept rocking to it for probably a week. Its the same Kyuss formula... find a riff, built on it by expanding on the key, bring it to crescendo, and then rock it out. And it always works.  <br /> <br />\\"Size Queen\\" is a grooving rythm that is more funky than things Kyuss has done in the past. Again, it is based on a single riff created by Josh Homme that is distinctly his own, but they build it well. One gets the feeling that much of Kyuss' music is built on riffs that Josh discovered while messing around with his guitar, but every song is inevitably a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />\\"Catamaran\\" is beautiful. It uses much less distortion, much more reverb (and maybe some chorus?), and is much more expansive than any other song on the album. Again, Kyuss shows the odd talent to  blend metal with melody, because it isn't long before \\"Catamaran\\" takes on the low dirge of metal riffs, but falls right back into the melody. It is sad that it is only a 2 minutes and 59 seconds long. <br /> <br />\\"Catamaran\\" is followed by \\"Spaceship Landing\\", an appropriately long jam that ends the album, fades into silence after 11 minutes until 32:15, when a slow melody arises, a combination of many layers of Garcia's voice accompanied by only guitar and bass.  <br /> <br />The Kyuss triumverate, \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\", \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\", and \\"...And the Circus Leaves Town\\", are a must-have set for anyone looking for unique and pleasurable music. The first album, \\"Wretch\\" will disappoint anyone familiar with Kyuss' later work, but it is an extra piece to add to the collection, just to say you have it.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I do not have too much to add in the way of reviewing the content or significance of this movie. Quite simply, this film, which lived for years as a cult hit before being appreciated by a wider audience, is a classic in so many ways. This was the movie that led me to an appreciation of film, and I've gone on to embrace countless movies within several genres, from 'Paths of Glory' to 'M' to '12 Angry Men', thanks to the inspiration that this picture supplied.     My comment has to do with the absurd notion of including a special feature concerning the impact that this movie had on the hip hop generation and it's musicians. In no way, shape or form does this movie have anything to do whatsoever with hip hop, and to include a featurette of millionaire pseudo ganster rappers just because a few of them thought it was inspiring to see a character like Tony Montana on screen is TOTALLY irrelevant to the film and should not be presented as a feature within the DVD release. Quite simply, what drove this being included was money, plain and simple. The Nazi party has had incalcuable influence on skinhead hardcore bands, but I would not expect to see a featurette on the band 'Aryan' within a DVD of Nazi and/or WWII history. Just senseless and unnecessary. Don't get me wrong- I actually came to be aware of Scarface through an album released by The Geto Boys in 1990. So in a way I came to this film through the work of a rap group. However, to present the impact that Scarface had on the rap culture in general as a featurette, calling the film 'a hip hop classic' (!!!), is just plain wrong. They could mention this impact in a 'making of' sequence, but spending anymore than 1 minute in the process would do a disservice to the film. Overall, the features on this DVD are excellent, save the pointless and unnecessary rap segment.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This movie was fan-bloody-tastic!!!! I loved it! Im a big fan of gailman anyways... and the fact that there are references to Black Adder, Red Dwarf, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Coupling, and many many more movies/series I love just makes it better! <br /> <br />IF!...anyone does not like this film....they really dont know anything. And they probably like silly flims like Napolian Dynamite.... or Mr. Bean.... (yes im a Rowan Atkinson fan..but lets face it..Mr. Bean was not his full potential). <br /> <br />Any how!

6300214028|5.0|It's shocking that this isn't available on DVD, representing, as it does, perhaps Warren Beatty's greatest accomplishment as a filmmaker. This epic drama tells the story of John Reed, the only American buried in the Kremlin, and his enmeshment in the events surrounding the Bolshevik revolution...if it sounds like dry history, rest assured that it is far from...the film achieves a great balance between the historical context and the personal dramas of the characters' lives...and what great acting: Beatty gives one of his absolute best performances,and as for the rest of the cast including Diane Keaton, Paul Sorvino and Jack Nicholson (as playwright Eugene O'Neill), they are, without exception, magnicent...let's hope this makes it to DVD soon...epics like this are made for hi-def, big screen TVs!

0738206679|4.0|As another reviewer mentions, this book is something of a mixed bag.  On one hand the author does an excellent job building up his argument, presenting and explaining each chunk in a clear yet sometimes slightly challenging manner.  Thus, the reader isn't left with mere fluff and \\"armchair\\" suppositions.  On the other hand, this is a work intended for the general reader and, therefore, tends towards reduced explanations and lacks the rigor that a more specialized reader (economist, sociologist, mathematician, for example) may desire.  Further, the author doesn't provide much direction for those who wish to read further.  Aside from the generalizations, some of the information and examples used are already dated - certain examples from the web may seem like ancient history to many readers.<br /><br />That said, I found this a worthwhile book.  It is a relatively easy and pleasant read.  The argument develops at a casual pace - though it does develop, this isn't a book to skip around in - with small chunks within each chapter.  Moreover, there were enough original ideas to get me thinking, yet enough references with which I was familiar that I could keep my bearings.  While I do have a background in Sociology, I suspect that most readers will have similar experiences.<br /><br />I imagine that specialized readers, that is those who have a strong background studying networks, will find this work a bit too introductory, if not lacking entirely.  However, for the casual reader, particularly those interested in \\"six degrees of separation\\" relationships, I feel that this book will be a worthwhile read.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I first read this story in a doctor's office waiting room in 1997.  Having read \\"The Shipping News,\\" I knew of Annie Proulx, and as I was leafing through The New Yorker, I saw one of her stories.  So I started reading it.  The beginning was interesting and got my attention (the prologue was added later, it didn't appear in the original story as published in the magazine).  I thought it was going to be about two lonely young men finding each other in friendship. <br /> <br />Then  WHAM, the first tent scene happens, and it suddenly gets a hell of a lot more interesting.  I raced through the story, and on its inevitable tragic conclusion, I completely lost it and began crying.  At that moment, the nurse came out, very concerned.  She saw the magazine in my hands, chuckled, and said \\"\\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" huh?  You're the third one this week.\\" <br /> <br />I remember thinking what an amazing film this would make, but that it never would get made.  I suffered through the rumors of other directors for years.  Finally, it was announced that Ang Lee was directing (SCORE!), and starring Heath Legdger (huh? well, at least he was good in \\"Monster's Ball\\" and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko as Jack Twist? WTF?).  Then it started was released in the Venice and Toronto film festivals, and took the top prizes in each.  The buzz started.  The anticipation was KILLING me.  Finally, it opens on December 9th (thank GOD I live in LA).  That Saturday, as I sat down in the theater, I couldn't believe it was actually TIME to see \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\"  I had incredibly high expectations...killer story, ace screenwriters, Ang freaking Lee, winning every award under the sun.  How could it live up to my expectations? <br /> <br />It didn't.  It exceeded them.  And no, it's not overhyped, it's THAT GOOD. <br /> <br />The spare, but powerful, little story had been transformed into an archtypal tragedy of repressed love.  The opening on the mountain was majestically filmed, Brokeback Mountain isan idyllic Eden where two innocent young men find love in a completely unexpected place, and nurture it over a summer of sheep herding.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I thought that their growing attraction was fairly obvious, and as they began to open up to each other an intimacy grew, slowly and cautiously leading up to that first encounter in the tent.  At the end of the summer, their idyll over, they marry, father children, and continue to meet several times a year to spend time in the outdoors and just be with each other.  The tragic ending is simply the most devastating moment on film that I've ever experienced, and, having read the story, I fully expected it...yet it just bowled me over.  I had to compose myself in the car for 20 minutes afterwards so I could drive home.  I thought I was over it, but the next day in the shower I lost it again.  This movie kicks you in the guts, then gets under your skin and stays there for a very long time. <br /> <br />Ang Lee is a master, but this is his best work thus far.  He's created a film that tells a story in silences and glances rather than words, an extremely emotional film that somehow manages never to cross the line into sentmentality.  This film could have easily become a caricature in the hands of a lesser talent.  Lee lets it breathe, keeping the pace slow and letting the film tell us about the characters as quickly as it needs.  The emotional impact is greatly enhanced by Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous, but nuanced, cinematography (trivia bit, that's him in the Mexico scene) and Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting score and wonderful country music selections.   <br /> <br />I LOVED THE SHORT STORY, and Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana have done probably the best adaptation in cinematic history.  Unlike most adaptations from novels, which need to be trimmed, the short story needed fleshing out, particularly the characters of the long-suffering wives.  The added scenes felt nothing but organic to the story, seamlessly blending in with the framework created by Proulx.  The added scene between Ennis and his daughter was particularly welcomed, as it gives Ennis at least some small degree of hope and redemption, instead of a doomed life of isolation and emotional bleakness. <br /> <br />Finally, the cast are uniformly superb.  Anne Hathaway is perfect as Jack's wife Lureen.  We first see her as a vital, vivacious rodeo queen who puts the moves on Jack and reels him in.  As the years go by, she becomes bitter and removed, probably due to her loveless marriage, as Jack was emotionally committed to someone else.  Ennis' wife Alma, wonderfully played by Michelle Williams, actually knows what's going on, yet doesn't confront Ennis for years, and long after divorcing him.  Her scene where she finally confronts him is an almost frightening outpouring of rage, sadness, and regret. <br /> <br />Jake Gyllenhaal, despite my Donnie Darko misgivings, was superb.  I liked him a lot on first viewing, but it was only on my second and third viewings that I realized how truly good he really was, as I was distracted by Ledger's performance.  Jack is a quixotic character, mercurial, optimistic, and earnest, and Gyllenhaal plays him like a finely tuned violin. <br /> <br />But Heath Ledger carries this entire film on his shoulders.  His stellar rendition of the brutally repressed Ennis is a career-defining triumph.  He completely disappears into the role, it's as if he knows how Ennis BREATHES, so rigid that his lips hardly moves when he talks, his body language encumbered.  Yet when he's with Jack, he allows himself to open up, and gradually allow himself to become intimate with another person.  Folks, this is the real deal.  This is up there with Ben Kingsly in \\"Gandhi,\\" Daniel Day Lewis in \\"My Left Foot,\\" and Charlize Theron in \\"Monster.\\"  I completely forgot I was in a movie theater watching an actor, I was watching ENNIS DEL MAR.  The transformation was total, breathtaking acting at its best. <br /> <br />Minor quibbles:  the ageing makeup was truly awful (note to some reviewers...the moustache doesn't disappear on Jack's lip in the scene near the end, it's a FLASHBACK), and the editing was a bit choppy, possibly due to the first editor dying and being replaced near the end of postproduction.  Hey, no film is perfect. <br /> <br />However, this one gets about as close as it gets.  Six stars.

B000028U0Y|5.0|I grew up with country music in my family and I never was a big fan because I found it to be cloyingly wholesome. However, when I watched the Mark Romanek DVD, Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt\\" not only won me over, it sent chills down my spine. I had to find out more. I don't really care if the music reflects Johnny Cash's personal life or not. All I know is that he enters a prison, probably the toughest audience and comes out a winner. The songs ranging from parodies to ballads to unnervingly realistic songs about what it feels like to be on the wrong side of the law really strike a chord with the audience. In addition, it is a great live recording. It is not edited or dubbed or pieces of various concerts artificially linked together. It sounds like the way a quality live recording should, albeit with excellent sound. You can hear the goings on of the prison in the background and realize that this is a captive audience, so to speak. Its not like that grey area recording the Sex Pistols did in a prison. Johnny Cash has said he performed in prisons throughout his career and that this was just part of his regular performance tour, not a shock value stunt. Perhaps you may never meet people from this walk of life but now you have it presented for you, in your face and come out a convert.
0375507256|2.0|Like many postmodern novels, it's about form over content. There is nothing here you haven't read in Pynchon. While the writing is witty, it also goes nowhere, leaving a faint depressive sensation and the suspicion that life after all is as empty as this book.

0060872675|5.0|I wandered into Pandemonium Books and Games with my six-month-old, and was delighted to see this book, read it straight through, and promptly bought it.  The baby's too young to appreciate it, but I've now done dramatic readings for my husband and our housemate. <br /> <br />The pictures are marvelous; I see more details every time I read it. Much of it is clearly taking place in the Sams' imaginations, and it's really marvelous.  I love how the toys imitate Young Sam's mood. <br /> <br />I can see how the one commenter found it jarring to see a depiction of a person he'd pictured differently (I never expected CMOT Dibbler to be so... dapper, myself), but I can still enjoy what someone else sees.

055255202X|5.0|Well, I loved Terry Pratchett's \\"The Wee Free Men\\" so much that I thought I would be disappointed by this one. While I still liked those little blue miscreants better, this book was very entertaining. Maurice is simply a delicious character, and I loved the various rats (who, now that I come to think of it, remind me of the Wee Free Men). Of course they have great names, these rats, and that alone is worth the price of admission, as they say. Few authors can make me laugh out loud, but Pratchett is one of them. If you've never read this author, then this is a good book to start with! As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with magic and talking animals.

There is not a dull moment in this one.
B0000025RI|5.0|Don't let the reputation of the artist get in the way of what is great music.  Thriller is a great album that was put out in 1982.  Personally, I love it.  The music is very rich and funky, and Michael Jackson was a great singer.  The song Thriller is an awesome song, and the Music Video is also awesome.  MJ has and always will be one of the best pop artists of all time, if not the \\"King of Pop\\".  Highly recommended.
0385486804|5.0|Be prepared to have your thoughts consumed by Chris McCandless, his family, and those who crossed paths with him during the last few years of his short life.  While I expected to experience some level of the \\"spook factor\\" involved in reading an account of someone's last days, I didn't expect to find myself as fascinated and moved by this young man's life and the choices he made.  Whether you find yourself critical or sympathetic of McCandless, this book is well worth engaging.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Just sit back and let this beautiful film flow over you. It is a masterpiece. This is exactly why the visual medium of films exists. If you are looking for a well rounded narrative, Hollywood has hundreds of those every year. This is something different. If you don't get it I am truly sorry. Remember that dreams are not straight narratives either. Not everything needs expalining.
B0006SSOHM|2.0|This movie was not bad but it wasnet good either it's just there. The acting was really bad and I mean bad it's funny to watch them act becouse you dont believe them at parts and you want to tell them to get acting lessons. The story is ok about two men changed to the wall and they have to saw there arms or legs off to survive. The film has lots of pointless charactors and the film i found draged on at times. The film did have some disterbing and scary moments and the ending was pretty good. Overall it;s worth to watch once but it's not great or good and not as good as people where saying it was.
0465043550|3.0|Many of the reviews of this book criticize Mandelbrot because his concept of fractals does not provide a 'magic bullet' method for trading the markets or dealing with risk. Maybe not, but he sure provides a lot of proof that the other systems and theories don't work!<br /><br />If you are an average investor just trying to accumulate enough money in your IRA to retire on, this book is probably a little 'deep'. Unfortunately, the message is of great importance. What is that message? That the professional money managers and financial advisors and large corporations all base their money management and risk management actions on theories that are inherently wrong. If one of these 'professionals' is managing your money for you, like in managing a mutual fund, your risk of suffering a significant loss to your invesment nest egg is far greater than you may have been lead to believe.<br /><br />Most investors need to concentrate more of their energy on minimizing substantial losses than maximizing gains. Think I'm wrong about that? Just consider this. If you have $100,000 in your account and the market goes up 30%, you now have $130,000. But, if the market follows that '30% Bull gain' with a 20% 'bear loss', you now find yourself with only $104,000 in your account! What good is a great gain if you give it all back?<br /><br />Unfortunately, all the brokerages and money managers and financial advisors only talk about 'gains'. They seldom talk about losses. And for good reason. If you knew what they know, you probably wouldn't invest with them.<br /><br />So, if you have the time and will put in the effort to read Mandelbrot's book, you will come out with a greater appreciation for the importance of managing the risks associated with investing your money, and a far greater skepticism about the people who profess to be able to invest your money wisely for you.
B000AP04L0|3.0|I ordered the widescreen version and received the fullscreen version. I could have went to Target and paid less but they don't have the widescreen version either. Doubt I will use amazon.com ever again. This is the second time they have disappointed me.
B00008RWRN|5.0|If you are a lover of rock, then Machine Head by Deep Purple is a must in your collection. I think I have almost every cd and vinyl version of this lp (except the original quad version) in my collection. This was recorded by the Mark II version of the band which is their best lineup. Ian Gillan, Richie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, and Ian Paice were the essential hard rockers of the day (along with Led Zeppelin). Recorded in the Grand Hotel in Geneva Switzerland. Because of a fire, the band had no place to record. However, this hotel in Switzerland was empty during the winter and negotiations were completed to use the hallways and corridors to complete the lp. The song \\"Smoke on the water\\" sums up the story quite nicely. This lp rocks from start to blazing finish with such classic tunes as the above track, Highway Star, Lazy, and Space Truckin. It leaves you begging for more when it's over. Now, there are 2 surround sound versions of this lp available. The Dvd audio version, and the Super Audio version. Since I have both, I will give you my most honest review, and leave it up to you to decide. First off they both sound excellent. But there is a clear winner of the two. Listening to both several times, I believe the imported Super Audio version wins by a slight margain. The dvd audio version contains many differences in the songs, compaired with the original versions. Guitar solo's are different, also the dvd audio sounds a little more harsher with less bass, and also some of the songs are longer than the original versions. This is not altogether a bad thing but if you want the versions of the songs as close to the originals as possible, then this (SACD)is the cd to have. It has the warmth and sound of the original recording in PCM stereo, and also contains the \\"Original\\" quad versions from the lp that was released. Since these are the quad versions there is no sound coming from the center speaker. However there is sound from the subwoofer if you have the 5.1 audio system setup. Even without the audio from the center speaker, the vocals are still mixed in nicely so you wont't notice the difference too much. So I claim this to be the 1st 4.1 surround cd I have in my collection. You also get some alternate surround mixes of Lazy, Maybe I'm A Leo, and When A Blind Man Cries. The Dvd audio isn't bad but in my opinion, the Sacd version just all around sounds better. It is not that easy to get, however. And it is more costly than the standard cd version. But because I love this lp so much I happily shelled out a few more dollars to get it. Now if only Led Zeppelin IV would be released in surrround sound..........................udio system setup.

B0002IU988|1.0|One horrible band has split to make two horrible bands.  They're like Gremlins, please keep them away from water!!!  It sounds like a horrible tribute band of every 90's has been.  It could be a bunch of Guitar Center rejects playing half ass Soundgarden covers.  Just terribly insulting that this type of music is produced and pushed on music listeners.  Anybody who appreciates real thought provoking music should avoid this CD at all costs.  This could be almost as bad as Creed, I haven't got the stomach to listen to Scott's solo album, so I can't bring him into this.  These guys would do well on American Idol, because it fits that mindless, cheesy, empty droning that you hear from that show.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Having just seen the movie for the second time,just in time for the Oscars,I can truly say that this is one of the best musical biopics I've ever seen.The \\"Man In Black\\" stands tall next to last year's \\"Ray\\" as a testiment to the power of a well told story....especially if it's true. <br /> <br />          For this generation of movie goers,\\"Walk The Line\\" is a real eye-opener in terms of showing younger audiences just how powerful an impact Johnny Cash made in the music world.For older audiences who've been fans of Cash for years,the film confirms what they already knew:Johnny Cash carried all of the weight of the misery he endured in his life in every dark vocal he sang. <br /> <br />        The film itself follows the new form of telling bios in that they try and have a \\"moral\\" to the story.In the case of \\"Ray\\",it was how a person with a disability could overcome to achieve great things.In \\"Walk The Line\\",the moral center of this tale is how the love of a good woman can save a man's soul. <br /> <br />    On that note,the film follows the rise of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from his beginings as the \\"black sheep\\" youngest child to a poor cotton farming family,who was haunted by the death of his sainted big brother,to his stint in the Air Force,through his early recording years at the legendary Sun Records Studio,through his struggle with an addiction to alcohol and drugs,to his redemption thanks to his singing partner and friend,June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br />           Aside from being a great romantic tale,the film also serves as a lesson in music history.As Johnny rises to fame at Sun Records through early hits such as \\"Cry,Cry,Cry\\",\\"Get Rhythm\\",and \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\",he goes out on tour with Sun's other rising young stars:Jerry Lee Lewis (played to looney perfection by Waylon Malloy),Carl Perkins,Roy Orbison,Waylon Jennings (played by his son,Shooter Jennings),and of course,Elvis Presley.For me personally,at 26,I only heard Cash's big hits like \\"Walk The Line\\" and \\"Folsom\\".I did not know he sang \\"Get Rhythm\\".The first time I saw the film,there were alot of 20-somethings in there like me who probably didn't know much about Cash.....I wonder if any of them went out and got one of his Greatest Hits Collections..... <br /> <br />           As I close this out,I'd like to point out something that I've seen other reviewers grumble about:Joaquin and Reese's singing.First off,NOBODY sounds like Johnny Cash.That being said,I give Phoenix an \\"A\\" for effort.Hey!At least he learned to play the guitar and tried to sound like Cash.That's what gave the film the weight of reality it needed.The same goes with Reese's singing and portrayal of June Carter.She may not've been \\"note perfect\\" in sounding like June....but I think her portrayal proves that she can act outside of \\"fluffy\\" romantic comedies. <br /> <br />     If you're looking for a damn good,not to mention entertaining,biopic....\\"Walk The Line\\" fills the bill....Now.... If you'll excuse me...I must go and pre-order my copy of the film. <br /> <br />

0671042858|5.0|This novel doesn't fall into King's gross-out category.  It's not a book about vampires or haunted houses or aliens from outer-space and no one gets slimed or disembowled.  (Not that I have anything against those books.  I think King does them pretty well.)  Yet neither is it a book where King gives his take on a different genre--like his Westerns or crime stories.  It's somewhere in between.  Mostly it's just about a young girl getting lost in the woods.  There's a supernatural terror that is hinted at, and that may or may not be real.  But King keeps this terror mostly in the background.<br /><br />The book doesn't suffer for it, though.  Just Trisha's narrative of traveling through the woods on her own, becoming more and more lost yet determined to survive, is a gripping as anything King has written.  Maybe it lets King play to his strength--making the reader believe in a child's point of view is something he has always done as well as anyone.  It's also all the more powerful because of the novel's realism.  The book is effective because we are sucked into Trisha's reality--imagining how this could happen to someone and what it would be like to be lost in the woods.  When the supernatural events (real or hallucinated) do come, King has already gotten us to accept everything that's happening to Trisha.<br /><br />If this novel plays to King's greatest strength, it also avoids his worst weakness--creating a situation that he doesn't know how to get out of.  So many of King's novels (THE STAND, DESPERATION) don't seem to know how to end, and the \\"payoff\\" we get is unsatisfying.  That's not true here.  And while some of King's novels come with a heavy-handed moral--or else a garbled one, this one is right on the money.  It's really a book about the misfortunes that some kids (and some adults) have to face--misfortunes that aren't their fault but which they have to deal with anyway.  While some of King's novels deal with this in a symbolically and narratively clunky way, this one is graceful, poingant and rings true.unky way, this one is graceful, poingant and rings true.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Let me start off by saying that Ive been a fan of Korn for a long time. When I first listened to \\"See you on the other Side\\" I was not really all that surprised. Jonathan Davis did work on the Queen of the damned soundtrack, and a lot of the tracks have this feel to them as well. Gone are the days of Blind or A.D.I.D.A.S or Freak on  a leash. Which I kind of expected with the departure of Head. Listening to the new disc, it becomes clearly apparent who was responsible for Korn's sound. <br /> <br />Not to say that Munky and the rest of the band havent picked up the slack, but Korn has clearly gone in a new direction. I was a bit skeptical at first, but with every listen, this disc grows on me. My favorite tracks are, \\"Politix\\", \\"Souvenier of Sadness\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Liar\\", and \\"Ive Seen it all\\". Like I said, its a pretty good listen but if your looking for the signature Korn sound its just not there, its just missing that special something that put some of their previous works over the top. If your a fan of Korn you should appreciate this CD. If anything, it will make you want to dust off your older Korn CD's. I hope this review was helpful. By the way, whats with all of these people dissing \\"Take a look in the Mirror\\" I think this CD is phenomenal. Im still listening to it. Favorite Korn disc-\\"Follow the Leader\\", minus \\"All in the Family\\" the track with Fred Durst.
0684833395|4.0|<br /> <br />This is a funny movie but I do believe it helps to have been in the Air Corps and experienced some of this first hand---also to have read the book in advance of seeing the movie.

So, when one can just enjoy a good mix of suspense, who done it and why???? that uses delightful prose...go for it.  There is even a laugh or two.

The pictures are not lively, some of them are even black and white.  I thought it was just okay.  With that said, my 8-month old daughter loves this book.  She loves when I read it to her before bed.  It is the only book that we have that she will sit through repeatedly.  Everytime I try to throw a new book in she starts fussing half way through.  So, I usually just end up reading this book over and over again.  Great for small children!  Highly recommend!

I'd just finished watching \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and thought \\"What the Heck?\\"  I'm glad I did.

0142004235|5.0|I have seen the movie and thought I knew \\"East of Eden\\".  I got the book for Christmas and decided to read it.  Surprise!  The book is a wonderful, in depth story of the lives of many characters against the back drop of the Salinas Valley at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a terrific American story.  The movie uses only about 15% of the book.  I am not as impressed with the movie now that I have read the book.  I realize now that the movie is supported by it's fine acting rather than by the story. The story in the movie is really a cut-and-paste job of the book.  Read the book.  It's a real treat.

0440237688|4.0|I've read this book multiple times, the first being when I was in middle school, and what impresses me the most is that every time I read it, I find something new that makes me stop and think.  This time around, I stopped to think about the concept of everything having \\"sameness\\".  My first instinct was to compare the society of The Giver to that of a Communist society, but the main themes go further than that.  In The Giver, the society strove to repress all memories, painful or otherwise, in order to form a more perfect world.  But would this really serve an important purpose?  I think even if the world could somehow convert itself into an equal playing field for everyone, the lack of independence and personal choice would stifle society's ability to function.  It's an interesting concept. <br />       <br />      I also think the reader can draw comparisons from the society to today's.  The emphasis on the Twelves to pass from childhood to the adult world is comparable to today's high school senior.  After that certain age, the child is left to make the decisions of their future and to train for the path they choose.  There are many other such similarities throughout the novel as well. <br />       <br />      Overall, the book had an interesting concept and was quite thought-provoking.  At times, the pace was a bit slow for my liking, and some of the events seemed rushed or out of place, but in general the book was very well-written.  It was able to maintain an easy reading style while at the same time contained matter that adults could relate too.  Plus, it's different than the traditional youth story.  It truly makes you imagine the possibilities. <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I have waited for ages to see this after all the hype and extreme reviews at each end of the spectre. Reading many different reviews I had decided in my head that it was going to be a feel good movie for a mature age gay man (me) to see. It was a month late opening at my local complex, and behind the excuses the truth appears to be 'due to the religeous lobby'. So yesterday I finally saw it. At first I was put off by the bleakness, but was swept up in the subtle layers, and had to remind myself, that this was the early 60's and it was uncannily accurate to my own experience.One cannot go into details without spoiling the experience for those yet to see it so in a nutshell, by the conclusion , I was in a state of devastation which is still with me a day later.Many small sequences are so fast ,it probably needs another viewing, but already my opinion is ,Ang Lee has touched the face of god, unlike the rednecks who will remain in ignorance for eternity. To those yet to see it, remember, we are all gods creations and he made us all for a purpose and those who judge in his name will answer to him.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album kicks ass. Simple as that. Great song writing/lyrics/guitar I loved it from the first listen. It's awesome that bands are finally stating to discover actually singing songs and playing guitar again. If listeners are looking for screaming grunt lyrics and repetitive boring rhythms there is more than enough of that crap out there. Maybe because any one can do it. Grow up.
B0006399FS|1.0|Although i'm a big fan of U2 but i think this album was not great as well. You should not believe those who give 5-stars or 4-stars reviews because some of the song in this album was so terrible and the lyrics was not meaningful. If you don't like the 1st singles from this album \\"vertigo\\", you should not buy it because all the song are the same. I think this is juz a \\"ok\\" album for me.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I wholeheartedly agree with the general consensus of the reviewers of this film...it wasn't the gay aspect of this movie that was so striking. It's relating it to your own life and remembering a time when you love and long for someone and you can't have them for whatever reason. I saw this movie last night, and I still feel affected by it. The performances by the two male leads were so convincing and heartfelt, that when the ending came, I was actually unhappy about what had happened with these characters. That how much it made me feel.
0670034711|5.0|I read this book in 1-day which is highly unusual for me!  Finding one's self in fallout of loss and life change can be hugely challenging; however, it has never been easier to hear about than through the lens Elizabeth Gilbert's experience.  I am relieved to find a writer who can probe and explore the physiology of change without leaving their guts and all the un-necessary, often all too boring and redundant details all over the dining room table, or living room floor for that matter. Gilbert is quick, colorful, current, highly entertaining, lucid and thorough as she resolves some very big life questions.  If you want to see someone make sense of change, AND move on, read this book.  ON the other hand, if you need to experience someone dissecting their depression endlessly, and beating a dead horse you may not be ready for this.
B00004RF9B|4.0|When any list of great Science Fiction films is compiled \\"Forbidden Planet\\" will always rank near the top.  It is also represents a unique collaboration between MGM and Disney studios. Disney providing much of the out of this world landscapes and Labs. It's sometimes hard to remember this was all done at a time when computers themselves were \\"high science fiction\\". This accounts for much of the \\"cartoon like\\" look of the film which in its time was totally convincing wonderfully detailed world(maybe a little dated by todays standards ). Another interesting aspect  is the Krell Architecture it is \\"clearly not intended for humans\\"  Doorways are very wide at the base rather the \\"human proportions\\" for instants. This is one of the few scifi films ever to present the \\"aliens\\" as as something other than monsters in \\"our own image\\". Strange also considering the \\"ID\\" monster.     Much of what sets \\"Forbidden Planet\\" apart from anything before or after is the work of Louis & Bebe Baron \\"Sound Tonalities\\" what amounts and \\"Electronic Music\\" and effects track. This represents the Krell music (haunting) it is very unique and distinctive (to \\"Forbidden Planet\\"). Ground breaking to say the least. This is in a day before transitors were common.     As one watchs the film it's extremely hard to believe that this was more than a decade before \\"Startrek\\", \\"2001\\" and \\"Starwars\\".  But,its all here, Communicators, CD's, faster than light space travel and robots! Of special note is the much loved Robby the Robot. It is telling how much Robby resembles a \\"Cash Register\\"!      The Tempest script device is an excellent one as is Walter Pidgeon as the Magician. I do find it somewhat troubling that the script tries to be both adult Scifi drama while also appearing juvenile at times. It appears as if having created a very good adult SCIFI drama based on a Shakespearean play the film makers paniced and trimmed much of the Tempests plotline and replaced it with \\"juvenile\\" comic relief. This was best done in Robbie's Character but also explains Earl Holliman's (comedy relief) Cookie. (Are those really tin pots and pans?)  It's almost as if there are two different films here. In rereleases \\"Forbidden Planet\\" has always been as a juvenile Saturday Matinee.  Odd considering adult nature of Shakespeares The Tempest.     An other problem is some of the dialogue sounds \\"clipped\\"! Leading me to believe the film once ran much longer than todays (cut for time and double billing) 99 minutes. Some of these edits are included in the earlier Criterion Laser Disc of Forbidden Planet.  All in all this is perhaps the best of 1950's Scifi Films. It has been long neglected as a DVD. I can only hope there is a new restoration with commentary and other extras in the works.    Postscript:  26 Nov 2006  \\"Forbidden Planet (Ultimate Collector's Edition)\\" is a mixed bag     First thing the Print is as good as I have seen!    Got to love the artwork the Collector case while \\"bulky\\" it's beautiful. The Collectable \\"Robbie\\" Action figure is wonderfully detailed (but careful it is fragile)!  One note on the Lobby cards they are reproduced on a dull matte finish not Glossy? Other extras include the very childish \\"Invisable Boy\\" what this adds I don't know! Some very informative Documentaries are included (but like many of todays Documentaries they are \\"LOVEFESTS\\" and suffer from the amount of unrelated bits interviews spliced together). One interesting exception is the Walter Pidgeon' MGM Parade TV spot.  This two disc set includes pieces of an early workprint which will be of interest.    Still lacking is a running commentary by a Film historian or critic like Rudy Behlmer or Ron Haver. What is lost in this presentation is develpment (backstory) of the project and criticism. Also I would have included the the ground breaking sound track either on CD or alternate isolated sound track.    Missing also are many of the extras from the Criterion \\"Forbidden Planet\\" Laserdisc including the \\"Fatal Planet\\" Screen treatment and Text essay and numerous stills.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was determined to see it at the movies ever since it came out because I liked the book and saw it. Jane Austen is a funny author and this movie has definitely captured her wit. I liked it better than the BBC version by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and I think every version ever made although I've never seen them all. <br />First of all, the circumstances of the Bennett family is very realistic and the characters were very well-chosen, especially Mrs. Bennett and Keira Knightly who judging by her earlier works that she would make a good Elizabeth. (The only character that I wasn't satisfied with was Mr. Bingley.) Then there was Mr. Collins, his worship of Catherine de Bourgh and the ridiculous proposal to Elizabeth was done just right. Charlotte Lucas and Caroline Bingley were just exactly how I pictured they would be and Fitzgerald Darcy looks very arrogant indeed and shows interest in Lizzie in the right places. I must say that I like the rearrangements of places important things happen at, such as the first time Darcy proposes to Elizabeth. <br />The only part that depressed me was the rush of Darcy's letter to Elizabeth, which explained his nervous relationship with Wickham and reveals Wickham's true light. I feel that the elopement of Wickham and Darcy's sister wasn't explained very well and the elopement of Wickham and Lydia did not excite the nerves of the audiences for long. But the ending was a satisfying version of the modern movie required kiss of romance classics and isn't overdone. Overall I recommend this movie for everyone of all age any place in the world no matter you've read the novel or not--I'm sure you'll all like it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is by far the best tv show on right now.  It has suspense, comedy, drama, and action.  The writing is very witty, and the actors carry out the scenes perfectly.  Highly recommended.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Even though John Williams didn't do anything with this soundtrack, this was a very well done soundtrack and I don't and won't regret buying it. It's a great soundtrack and do listen to it on a ragular basis.
020530902X|5.0|If you answered yes, then you must get this book.  No more needs to be said.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|The film was perfectly cast, has a great cast and is entertaining from start to finish. Nicholas Cage was perfect for the starring role as a thoroughly amoral arms dealer; and Ian Holm was his equal in his performance and in his portrayal of someone with Grade Z ethics.  <br />Although the plot is completely different, I link Lord of War with the equally great A History of Violence. Both of these are light years ahead of almost everything made just a few years earlier. My hat's off to all of those involved in producing such films.  <br />Just be warned. These films are not sugar-coated and some may find Lord of War a bit too intense.
0060955775|5.0|I bought this book because I liked \\"The Alchemist.\\" But found it to be a very different and rewarding reading experience. The language was very simple and clear and lyrical, and the messages are great. Live for each day. Be grateful. Take chances. Connect with people.  Don't lament love lost. Highly recommended.
B00005JO9J|1.0|Soap. Opera.  <br />Not only is this show completely cheesy, predictable and cliche-ridden, but it also demonstrates contempt for nursing. <br />Alex- Like I said, I hate nurses. <br />Meredith- What did you just say? Did you just call me a nurse? <br />Alex- Well if the white cap fits... <br />The characters treatment of nurses is horrible. The show depicts tham as mindless drones, unable to do anything unless a doctor tells them to.  <br />This show also pokes fun at other professions. Such as Kindergarten teaching and postal work.  <br />The characters are so arrogant that I cannot stand to watch this show. <br />I definitely would not recommend this show. Anyway, it will probably die-off if it gets severed from Desperate Housewives. <br />Cheers! <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|brokeback mountain has become my favorite movie.it is a beautiful emotionally wrenching story about two men who loved each other but because of the dictates of society in the 60's and their own repressions were not free to be together. it is a tragic love story and the fact that it is about two men doesn't even matter. it is about love, bottom line. a love that transcends everything else in their lives. all the actors in this movie were wonderful but the one who affected me the most deeply was heath ledgers portrayal of ennis. he was absolutely phenomenal and just blew me away. he broke my heart and it stays with you long after you have seen it. a truly haunting depiction. no actors performance has ever gotten to me the way heath ledgers did. he made you feel everything that ennis felt. he was exceptional. if you haven't seen it you a missing a fabulous movie. it is the best movie i have ever seen.
0307276902|3.0|Had this book been 200 pages and cut the repetitive descriptions of the clinic (which, perhaps, seek to establish the monotony of his environment), \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" would have been a 5-star book.  Within it is a frightening look at a self-loathing but determined recovering addict to prove that he can take responsibility for getting and staying sober.  His relationship with Leonard and Lilly kept me from putting the book down and forgetting about it, as did his exploration (in the clinic) of what created his addiction and \\"the Fury.\\"  You will likely get restless at parts and be completely engaged at others.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|the soundtrack for brokeback mountain is hauntingly beautiful and sad and it fits the movie perfectly.  when i listen to it i see the scenes  they underscore over and over in my mind. it is an exceptional cd. you won't regret buying it.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|There's no reason this movie shouldn't have been a blockbuster...great plot, great cast, groundbreaking visual effects, and some of the wittiest writing seen on the big screen.  Not only does this movie mix genres (sci-fi and western) with a skillful touch, but it manages to \\"sell\\" life-and-death situations mixed with wry humor.  A must-have for your DVD collection, and definitely in my top 10 for 2005.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya never fails to please.   Amarantine is soothing to the ear and calming to the spirit.  I play Enya in my office daily in the background and those coming in comment on the beauty of the music.  After a long wait, this CD was well worth the anticipation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When this show first came on FOX I saw the \\"pilot\\", and was entirely underwhelmed.  Then I saw \\"Serenity\\" in the theatre, and loved it.  So, when I bought the Serenity DVD I took a chance and bought this series on DVD also.  On the one hand, I'm so glad I did.  On the other hand...the pain of falling completely in love with an already cancelled series is excruciating.  This series is absolutely wonderful...multi-dimensional characters, incredibly witty writing, and a compelling premise.  I'm sure plenty of the previous 2000 reviews explain the premise, and how fascinating it is to watch these characters survive at the fringes of space and at the edge of the law.  I'll just say, take a risk and buy these DVDs.  You won't regret it.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|I truly love listening and watching live performances. Many have been just plain awsome but this one is 'The Best'! At times I prefer other styles of music, at other times I need to hear hard, progressive metal to sooth my inner head bang. Dream Theater's 'Live at Budokan' is more than I imagined. The quality of their collective performance should be understood as nothing less than precise and accurate genius. The quality of the sound is as good as it can be. I don't have the luxury of surround-sound but what is delivered in stereo is incredible. Perfect dynamics with each instrument/vocal arrangement. The quality of the camera angles are worth mention too (other bands need to pay attention to who they hire for this particular job). <br />Two things I didn't like was that the default set-up is always in surround-sound with subtitles. I have to re-set it to stereo each time I watch it (which is a lot). The other thing is that my most favorite piece they do #9 Instrumedley has a glitch that stops the DVD every time. Which means I have to start the DVD over again and skip that particular selection (factory defect). I've tried two different DVD players and it stops on both. All-in-all, for those of you that pay attention to minute detail in live performances this DVD is gold!

B0000C7PSW|5.0|Released in the fall of 2003, Rufus Wainwright's third album took his listeners by surprise since there was more of a gap between his first and second albums.  While those two records established Rufus as an unprecedented, undeniable force in chamber pop music, it's not until this record that the sound comes full circle.  The music is a lot more lush, as is the production, which manages to sound slick at the same time, which is an enormous feat.  It almost feels like a magic trick, this marriage of pop music with classical elements, territory that was to be pushed to the max in the second volume of the Want CDs.  Favorite tracks are 14th Street and most especially Beautiful Child.  That song is so very cool.  Essential hearing.
0385491026|5.0|Like many readers, my first experience with Margaret Atwood was The Handmaid's Tale, and she has been one of my favorite authors ever since. Perhaps one of her greatest strengths is her ability to handle different styles with equal skill and grace, from the apocalyptic visions of Oryx & Crake to the layered intricacies of The Blind Assassin. The word \\"haunting\\" is often applied to her writing, and rightly so; Atwood's tales resonate with deeply real and intimate characters, and Cat's Eye is no exception. In Cat's Eye, Elaine Risley, a middle-aged painter who grew up in post-WWII Toronto, has returned to her childhood city for a retrospective gallery showing of her work. Like many of Atwood's novels, Cat's Eye shifts between the past and the present, alternating between the modern reflections of the aging artist and her childhood memories.<br /><br />Like The Robber Bride, Atwood explores the nature of female friendship, but with more sinister themes. In Cat's Eye the childhood antagonist is Cordelia, the ruthless ringleader of Elaine's small group of friends who Elaine fears but is unable to escape. Cordelia's treatment goes beyond simple playground bullying, but is rather a cunning and manipulative psychological abuse that begins to take its toll on the young Elaine. As she grows up in a state of perpetual anxiety and self-deprecation, she eventually comes to confront her relationship with Cordelia. In the process, however, Elaine loses a part of herself to that very same domineering behavior. As the power dynamics between Elaine and Cordelia shift as they stumble towards adulthood, it becomes clear that though the new Elaine is stronger on the surface, she is perpetually unable to escape the old fears and vulnerabilities of the past. As the older Elaine grapples with the clinging threads of her past, she is forced to come to terms with her identity as a woman, a daughter, and an artist.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Atwood utilizes Elaine's background as a painter not as a character device, but as a way of exploring the adult's processing of her childhood experiences. The paintings are described in detail, but still allowing the reader the liberty of understanding the artist through the art. Atwood's rendering of post-war Toronto is accessible and vivid, and her treatment of the middle-aged Elaine is equally approachable and intimate (for this 25-year-old reader). The writing is lucid and evocative, the imagery understated and lasting. Cat's Eye is more subtle than some of Atwood's other works, but is equally powerful, heartbreaking, and memorable.<br /><br />~ Jacquelyn Gillracter device, but as a way of exploring the adult's processing of her childhood experiences.

B00004RF9B|5.0|It was very nice to be able to order Forbidden Planet from  Amazon, but more importantly, this movie is a TRUE Sci-Fi classic. Young and old should watch this together. Robby The Robot to this day still permeates our society as what a robot is and can do for man. Usage of humor, the lack of bad language and a great story equates this movie to one of the all time greats.

0375703764|5.0|Or so says a friend of mine who recently picked it up upon my recommendation.  She says it is devouring her soul and she can't sleep at night. <br /> <br />It may not be a book for people who are afraid of the dark.  It's a difficult book to review, because it is so unique, and I fear anything I say may be a spoiler.  It is two stories in one, really, and I found myself immediately drawn in, not like with many books that require patience and dedication to get drawn in.  This grabbed me right from the line 'This is not for you,' and occupied my every spare moment until I completed it. <br /> <br />The book itself is a labyrinth.  It is not an easy read.  It is work.  You'll need book marks.  I recommend two of them.  I'm still trying to piece together the puzzles it presents.  It's full of mystery and symbolism.  I got very attached to the character of Johnny Truant, who does the majority of the footnotes.  The story is surreal, eerie and melancholy. <br /> <br />Someone else called it the scariest book they've ever read.  I didn't find it scary, maybe eerie.  I actually found it overwhelmingly sad.  I can't put my finger on exactly why, either.  And almost everyone I know who has read the book has had dreams about it. <br /> <br />Be prepared.  It will devour your soul.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I don't get why some people have a nerve to give this album one star and bash it cruelly. COADF is a brilliant piece of work by Madonna. From the start onto the end, you will be pleased and entertained to the extreme. My utter faves are Hung Up, Get Togther, Sorry, Future Lovers, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Jump, and Like it Or Not. Congratulations Madonna for another musical achievement.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I was gripped with emotion from the very beginning. The performances by both lead actors were brilliant, better than I ever expected. Supporting role by Michelle Williams absolutely great. NOt only was the storyline great, the writing, the directing, the landscapes were breathtaking, they really took you to the life.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was a fan of the show Firefly and was mostly hoping the movie wouldn't suck. Well besides Batman Begins this was my favorite movie of 2005. It was 2 solid hours of entertainment. Writer/Driector Joss Whedon knows how to blend action and drama with a range of emotions thrown it for a total package. I could go on and on but the simple truth is that this is a very good Sci-Fi film, probably one of the best in years. This is a rich universe that is real and tangible. I have turned on several people to the world of Serenity and they were all hooked by the end of the film. You don't have to know the back story before seeing the movie...it's all explained within. Though after seeing the movie you might want to pick up the Firefly DVD set to see what you missed on TV back in 2002. Trust me... you missed something good!!
B00007ELEL|5.0|I've read through the hundreds of reviews on this site and I'd like to propose a new approach. As it's extremely probable that whomever is reading this has most likely seen the film, rather then a recitation of the plot (or lack there of) and characters it would be beneficial to understand what Lebowski means to you. How has it changed you? How has it changed the way you look at film.<br /><br />The fact that this film was overlooked by critics upon release underscores the complexity of this pointillist masterpiece. Surreal, dense and howlingly funny are three terms you might never hear in a sentence save for describing Lebowski. This is less a traditional narrative than a puzzle that only reveals itself after multiple viewings. In a sense it gets better every time you see it. In deconstructing it you learn that every frame has purpose, every frame has a motive. In stepping back from it the allegories of the culture wars are clear. I've seen it nearly 100 times. Last week I recognized the artwork in Maude's studio and the impression it makes on the Dude's subconscious for the first time. Whenever you think your an expert at something you realize there's someone smarter than you and that was certainly the case when I attended Leboskifest last summer in Louisville. I'm not certain the Coens themselves could win that trivia contest. Those are certainly my people. See you this May in Austin!!!<br /><br />This is the Citizen Kane of our time.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places). <br /> <br />Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well \\"not even exist at the school\\", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents. <br /> <br />The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas. <br /> <br />The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
1401201911|2.0|In the preface, the hyperbolic Tom DeSanto wildly trumpets \\"Red Son\\" as a devastating critique of American foreign policy, not the cookie-cutter \\"feel-good propaganda\\" that might have been expected. Instead, he hints darkly at surrendering freedom in favor of security. <br />Oh please. The Soviet Union that Superman serves here is the sort of cookie-cutter comic book autocracy one might have expected in a 1950s comic and bears no resemblance to the murderous regime that truly was an \\"evil empire.\\" At one point, Stalin understands why Superman must rush off to save thousands in Vladivostok. This is the dictator who killed, yes slaughtered, tens of millions of his own people.  <br />It's this sort of superficial investigation that dooms \\"Red Son\\" to superficial stabs at political comment, and third-rate reimaginings of history that are, frankly, tiresome.  <br />Though the story is redeemed in the end by a circular ending which seems to say we are always doomed to repeat the same mistakes, this \\"devastating critique\\" is not really all that original, exciting, or particularly entertaining. Nor does it comment on anything except the overexcited imaginations of a bunch of leftists who obviously learned their politics from comic books. Grow up, guys.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star-studded cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Benecio Del Toro (Traffic), Jessica Alba (Honey), Mickey Rourke (Get Carter), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks), Clive Owen (Closer), and Elijah Wood (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy). The movie also features cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) and many others. The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.    Sin City comes straight from the comic by Frank Miller, who also takes the helm as co-director. It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.    I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.     Sin City is a comic book come true!    Recommended    A

B000244FDW|5.0|As an ardent admirer of the novel, which I have read many times, I love both this BBC adaptation AND the A&E version to which it is compared in such detail in the reviews below.  But I must give the edge to the BBC; it's closer in pacing and tone to the slyly satiric original, whereas the A&E version is more swoopingly romantic -- Austen as rewritten by Byron or Shelley.  (Not that that's a bad thing; it's just not authentic.  One can, for example, imagine Austen averting her eyes, if not actually cringing, during Darcy's wet t-shirt scene.)  Also the casting in the BBC is generally better, especially the roles of Mr. Bennet, Jane, Mr. Wickham (fabulously oily!), Caroline Bingley, Charlotte Lucas, and above all Lady Catherine; Judy Parfitt will own that role till the crack of doom.  I couldn't possibly choose between Elizabeth Garvie and Jennifer Ehle; both are quitessential Lizzys, though each embodies different aspects of the character (Garvie the lethal wit and intelligence, Ehle the vivacity and fearlessness).  But I must sound a note of discord to my fellow reviewers' estimation of David Rintoul's Darcy; his exquisitely measured, impeccably calibrated performance is my ideal of the character.  While I love Colin Firth's more brooding, warm-blooded interpretation, Rintoul's is closer to Austen. <br /> <br />The BBC version also has the benefit of being written by an actual novelist (Fay Weldon, whose book LETTERS TO ALICE ON FIRST READING JANE AUSTEN is also highly recommended); all five episodes are beautifully structured, and Weldon's invented scenes glisten with Austen-like hilarity.  By comparison, the otherwise admirable A&E adaptation commits one grave narrative offense: the audience should not discover Darcy's role in Lydia's wedding until Elizabeth does.  It should be as great a shock to us as it is to her.  But A&E reveals Darcy as Lydia's rescuer from the get-go, thereby needlessly dissipating a lot of potentially delicious tension.  <br /> <br />But to my original point: in the end, all these qualifications are but quibbles.  Both the BBC and A&E versions are radiant successes, each with its own glories, and I wouldn't dream of being without either of them.  The clear recommendation is to BUY BOTH.  And live happily ever after.
0790729407|4.0|Fairly stark review of the struggles of the Irish and their push for independence from the British.  Seems to be a good movie and a good history lesson.  I did a lot of internet research after watching this movie and found virtually all the facts to be accurate.  I've already seen it again.  A good buy.
B00005JO1P|5.0|\\"Hello. I'm Johnny Cash...\\" <br /> <br />Steller performances and a gripping adapted soundtrack make \\"Walk the Line\\" one of the best films I personally have seen in a long time.  <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon display radiant chemistry starring together as legendary country music icons Johnny Cash and June Carter. The story weaves inside the life and mind of musically-driven Cash who is swarmed into the spotlight with his \\"sharp like a razor\\" sound. But the torments the childhood loss of his brother, his breaking marriage, as well as misunderstandings with his father rapidly lead to a heavy addiction to drugs. June Carter (played by a magnificent Witherspoon) acts as a mentor and inspiration to Cash, as well as his soul mate for whom he is very much in love with. <br /> <br />There are several aspects of this film that I want to mention. I'll start with the opening credits. Wow, from the very first moment I have to say I was completely taken aback. It's difficult to explain to those who haven't seen it, but those who have, I'm sure you'll agree with me what an utterly stunning opening it was, with that infectious country beat contrasted with the confides of the prison. It was riveting, and immediately I knew this was going to be a wonderful film. <br /> <br />Jaoquin Phoenix was captivating as Cash, and I was impressed with the depth of similarities between him and his character. We all know of River Phoenix, Jaoquin's late brother who suddenly died of drug overdose in the early 90s. Then ofcourse was Joaquin's own battle with substance and drug abuse. Whether he meant these details to impact or not, Joaquin's performance is so honest and raw, one MUST draw the parallels. But alone the performance is inspired and he well deserved the Golden Globe. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon is as you've never seen her (ie Brunette!) as June Carter, and she's marvellous. I could really relate and connect with her character. As mentioned earlier, the on-screenchemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was so strong and poignant. I could really sense the connection. <br /> <br />Last but certainly not least is the music, which acts as the third character in this bio-epic. Phoenix and Witherspoon as you know put their own singing skills to the test here, and the result is amazing! I will be the first to admit country music is CERTAINLY not my thing, but even I found Cash's melodies and the actors' impression of them captivating. My views on country music were definately changed after this film. So if you are, like me, not a fan of country music, this film will certainly be an exception to that. <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" exceeded all my expectations and was a truly insightful, inspiring and moving love story. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon light up the silver screen and put in the finest performances so far in their careers. It's a film about self acceptance and companionship, that will certainly move you and make you think twice about country music. From it's thrilling beginning to it's heartwarming end, \\"Walk the Line\\" is a wonderful film!

B0007P3582|1.0|I thought this was a poor excuse for an album. I'm not a 50 Cent fan, but Get Rich or Die Tryin was a much way better album. What happened to the supposed \\"hood\\" in that fake gangsta. Man, Game's album killed this one. And one more thing. 50 claims to have written Game's album, but it sounds nothin like the Massacre, not even a lil bit. Game, keep doin what u doin, and please, put this wanksta to rest. <br />-PS: they didn't have the number on there, but i rate this album a -5 Stars..
B0000AOV85|2.0|For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon.
B00005JOFO|4.0|With all of the Oscar buzz surrounding this movie, I figured I should take it in, so as to be better prepared for water cooler conversation.  But nothing in it really strikes me as great, even with its novelty of subject matter.  To me, the two of them just don't appear to have enough chemistry for the kind of stuff we see early on between them.  It runs a little long, too--I was looking at my watch after the 50-minute point, and on through to the end.  Maybe I'm supposed to be convinced that a pair of commonly-situated buddies has a full and natural potential for finding romance of the kind not seen among the straight.  I'm sure there was a message relating to the central topic, like they should have married each other from the outset (if only it were legal).  But I was not personally moved.  I'm only thinking 3.7 stars on this one.
B000002UA2|5.0|I just bought the book by Nick Mason INSIDE OUT... and I learned a couple things about this piece of music I never knew.  Apparently they were in the middle of recording Dark Side, and they decided to take a break and fulfill a contractual obligation they agreed to do by making a soundtrack.  Well the movie was 'MORE' but due to some very nasty disagreements with the producers of the film and other folks, PF just decided to release this under their own moniker (Obscured by Clouds).<br /><br />with this in mind it is nice to compare the guitar playing and the organ playing and even the lyric writing to the DARK SIDE release.<br /><br />All that info aside, I have always enjoyed this cd, and I have five songs that I simply adore:<br /><br />1.  Burning Bridges.<br /><br />2.  Wots... Uh the deal.<br /><br />3.  Mudmen.<br /><br />4.  Childshood End<br /><br />5.  Stay.<br /><br />The common denominator of these songs is the most excellent organ playing of Rick.  I think it is his best playing on all of PF.  I really love the interplay of his keys with DG's guitar.  and it happens a lot over the years, but this CD is so relaxed and it really yields itself to rick.<br /><br />MOST XLENT.<br /><br />Have fun.
B00005JMCT|4.0|The American Pie triology closes with the most natural end to Jim's quest for love and sex, which is to marry.  Jim asks his band camp sweetheart, Michelle, to be his wife, and the hilarity ensues as the wedding plans unfold.  Planning a wedding is an enormous task to undertake, but add the cast of American Pie to it and it will be an extra raunchy, extra awkward good time. <br /> <br />There were a few things that were openly absent here which helped make the first two movies such successes.  Here the friend foursome does not include Oz, Kevin never mentions his former girlfriend, Tara Reid, again, and Shannon Elizabeth does not appear as the everyman fantasy.  To make up for this, see the stripper scene at Jim's house. <br /> <br />A lot of people were annoyed with this movie, and I think I see why although I thought it was a good idea.  Stiffler, the evil frat brat, has gone strait.  While he causes just as many problems, he is after a girl and wants to be seen as a nice guy.  When the time comes, he is able to put his best foot forward and actually saves the day at the end (the flowers).  Who would have thought?  But as his act is reveiled in the end, he gets his when he is tricked into having sex with grandma in the supply closet.  Ha ha ha ... <br /> <br />In the end, this was a good conclusion to the triology.  And who wasn't happy that Finch got to see Stiffler's Mom again?  That was some of the best pie I've ever had...
B00003CXAW|4.0|It's obvious to me that the original 1933 movie is the best out of the other 2 versions.  The recent version is really good, but it's doesn't much the oringinal.  I seriously don't think the first one will ever be topped in my lifetime.  Even for 1933, the movie totally rocks with it's great introductions to the characters and the fact that once Kong makes his appearance, the rest of the movie is pull action and excitement.  No wonder this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made.   The second disc is a great historical piece on Cooper and advancements of movie cimena.  If you are a huge movie history or classic movie buff, this is a MUST have to your collection.
6305428050|4.0|Another classic 80's comedy, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (aka \\"A Night on the Town\\") comes to DVD to delight old fans and new.<br /><br />When highschool senior Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) decides to spend Saturday night babysitting the Anderson kids Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan) as well as Brad's best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp), no one, not least Chris, will be prepared for the wild ride ahead, when Chris' best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) phones and begs to be rescued from the Chicago bus depot after an aborted attempt to run away.  Chris bundles the kids in the car and heads for downtown Chicago, but after getting stranded thanks to a flat tyre, the gang end up in a mess of trouble!<br /><br />This is such a fun film.  Elisabeth Shue glows as Chris and offers one of her funniest comedy performances.  Whilst she is best-remembered by most film critics for her role in \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\", to 80's kids like me, she'll forever be fondly regarded as Chris in AIB.<br /><br />Anthony Rapp, Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton are hilarious in their roles, and Penelope Ann Miller is a scream in the film's clever subplot of Brenda's adventures in the bus depot.  The film also features early turns from Vincent d'Onofrio, Bradley Whitford and George Newbern.<br /><br />The DVD is presented in non-anamorphic widescreen, with no extras whatsoever, but fans will just be happy to finally have this 80's gem on DVD.  A bargain price too.
B00005ABUB|4.0|Obviously, I cannot review Season One yet, so I will reminice about a few of my favorite episodes throughout the series run: <br /> <br />1) remember when Rudy was bitten/attacked by a chimpanzee giving Rudy superhuman strength, leading to a fight between he and Steve Austin?  Great episode. <br /> <br />2) when Steve had to battle a robot likeness of Oscar Goldman.  Another great one.  I like when Steve first notices something strange about Oscar.  Oscar is walking on the plush carpet in his office and Steve finds it odd that Oscar's footprints leave such deep carpet impressions.  So, Steve drops a pencil on the floor and Oscar unknowingly walks on it, crushing the pencil into pieces. <br /> <br />3) the first meeting and fight between Steve and Bigfoot. <br /> <br />4) my favorite - Steve has to battle that Venus space probe machine.  I believe it looks like a small silver tank.  It had a grappling hook at the end of that long mechanical arm.  I remember it grabbing Steve by that mechanical arm and throwing him.
B00000K3D4|4.0|An iconic and favourite movie for every child who grew up in the 80's, LABYRINTH now enchants a whole new generation of fans on DVD.  Feeling ignored and unappreciated by her stepmother, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) rashly wishes her new baby brother Toby into the clutches of Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie).  Realising her folly, Sarah must enter the magical twist-turning Labyrinth and continue through to the Goblin City if she has any hope of rescuing Toby.  But Sarah won't be alone, as she is joined by a motley crew of lovable characters like grumpy Hoggle and kind Ludo.<br /><br />As Sarah travels deeper and deeper into the Labyrinth, Jareth springs several traps in her path, testing her powers of love, loyalty and bravery.<br /><br />Beautifully-brought to life by Jim Henson and his Muppet crew, the creatures of LABYRINTH still amaze with their design and believability.  The performances of the main stars, Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, likewise are perfectly in keeping with the fantasy element of the story.  Believe it or not, but Jennifer Connelly was barely 14 when she did this film.  Her performance largely carries the film.  The centrepiece sequence of the film, where Sarah dreams she is attending a ball and dances with Jareth to \\"As the World Falls Down\\", is beautifully-shot with Jennifer Connelly luminous in a silvery white ballgown, and others in grotesque Commedia dell'Arte style masks.<br /><br />The script by MONTY PYTHON's Terry Jones is very witty and clever with homages to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and other fantasy stories.  David Bowie's songs form an integral part of the story with \\"Underground\\", \\"Dance Magic\\" and \\"Chilly Down\\" becoming anthems for the Jareth character.<br /><br />The DVD includes an informative featurette, \\"Inside the Labyrinth\\", which was made to publicise the film prior to it's original release, and includes interviews with Terry Jones, Jim Henson, Brian Henson, Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie.<br /><br />Well-worth another look for 80's kids and newcomers alike..
B000002BQK|5.0|I haven't really listened to any of Mariah's older albums, but I know all the singles.From looking at what those albums comprised of you can, you can tell all her sales were based on these massive singles. By no way am i degrading Mariah cause i love her and her voice but she was essentially making the same album over and over again. Butterfly was suppose to symbolize her freedom and emancipation from tommy and it did. You can tell from listening to the older albums how bad she wanted to do R&B. You could almost see tommy standing right behind her in \\"sing-sing\\" telling her that she needs to make it more pop. I think this album was beautifully ballanced between pop and r&b and it was great <br />I loved \\"the beautifull ones\\" i know prince fans are gonna hate me for saying this but i like it much better that the oringinal. This was essentially the \\"the prequel to the emmancipation of mimi\\" the diffrence is that in butterfly she is being emancipated from controlling figures, but in \\"emancipation\\" she is being emancipated from her self <br />
0385507755|5.0|By now, the majority of you reading this have most likely heard about the revealing of fabricated sequences from James Frey's bestselling memoir \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\" Many are angered that this book has turned out to be filled with what has been referred to as pure lies and overexaggeration.  <br /> <br />Yes, James Frey has come clean and admitted that some parts of the story never really happened. But when you cut away all of that and focus on the theme it entails, this memoir is still very important for society to read.  <br /> <br />This is because of the story it tells. The story of humankind falling prey to temptation, becoming engulfed in trouble, and being left wondering what has happened to your life. It is a timeless display of the trials people go through, the road that selfishness paves, and the ability that we DO have to overcome it. The resilience of the human spirit is no fabrication, and even though I picked up this book AFTER the truth came out about the author, I was inspired by the message and hope readers will somehow learn to see it for that.
B000BYA4JM|3.0|It seems that this movie will only appeal to the core audience - meaning Madonna fans. Yes! Madonna was awful in The Next Best Thing but this movie is decent. Madonna got a lot of smack for this movie. If another female actress would've played in this movie no one would ever question if it was bad acting or not. I don't know why everyone harps on Madonna so much. She sample ABBA's on Hung Up and everybody harped on her for that. ANd this is the first time she sampled in her 23 yr career. Everbody samples lyrics and sounds all the time especially Rap artists. Rap artists sample sounds & lyrics heavily and on a consistent basis and no one says anything. I guess Madonna would have to die in a plane crash like Aaliyah or something in order to get respect. This is a carefree movie and should've be judged as an oscar material movie.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Hmm...<br /><br />Well. This is debatable, now isn't it? Edgy, yet addictive. Classy, yet confusing. Their are two sides to this one. Over all, I liked it.
B0000AKCLS|3.0|The guitar work is excellent on this disc but to call it 'blues' can be a stretch at times. Much of the playing is very fast & a bit complicated - sometines that loses blues fans who want it 'bluesy', not 'rapid-fire.' When he slows down, he's excellent (i.e., Long Distance Blues), but that's rare. I'm new to hearing this guitarist - I'm always looking for new styles and approaches and didn't hear much that's different on this disc....he's great, don't get me wrong, but he's not 'the best' as some reviewers state (who obviously never saw/heard Jim Thackery!!). I also was not 'fascinated' or 'carried away' by this music and I have been a huge blues fan for many of my 3 decades of listening to it and seeing live shows. It may be the vocals -they're good, sometimes just OK, but not 'fantastic.' I do look forward to seeing/hearing him live in April '06.  I wish he would add a sax player or harmonica, remove the keyboards, and use a vocalist.....I still recommend buying it - but I doubt it will 'blow you away.'
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance. The name sounds a bit forboding, I'll admit. But go beyond that. What's in a name, any way?<br /><br />The songs had my heart beating a mile-a-minute. The ode to a dead loved one, Helena, the pain of being a high school out cast, the struggles of war-it's all in here.<br /><br />Powerful. That's all I can say. Powerful.
B000004CYT|5.0|There is a growing consensus among professional musicians, musicologists, and aficionados that the use of \\"period\\" instruments in performances of the Classical repertoire yields an authenticity that is not realized when modern instruments are used. This sparkling cycle is more grist for the mill. Clarity, balance, and rationality - the  hallmarks of the Classical style - shine through here. <br /> <br />Perhaps listeners raised on Karajan and Klemperer will be a bit jolted by the sound here. There are no theatrics, no fussy bombast, no histrionics. But for admirers of texture, the luxury of being able to hear the subtleties of orchestration will have a narcotic effect. To take but one example from this cycle, the fugal development of the final movement of Eroica is the most clear and balanced version I've yet heard. <br /> <br />Even so, the war between the \\"purists\\" and the \\"revisionists\\" will rage on, but thanks to this outstanding recording the former have gained yet another battle victory over the latter.

B000676SMQ|1.0|I ordered the 1933 Don Quixote directed by G.W. Pabst from Caiman.com via Amazon.  Their listing clearly said 1933 as does my reciept.  I paid more than $8.00 in \\"expidited\\" shipping for a $3.50 movie which ALSO shows on my receipt.  I received the movie 10 days later and it is some stupid 2005 cartoon version that doesn't even say 1933 ANYWHERE on the box.  I was VERY dissatisfied and will tell anyone who will listen not to bother ordering with Caiman.com.  You'd get it faster to remake the movie yourself.
B000002L42|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of all Steely Dan's output. It features amazing versions of my favorite tunes by some of my favorite musicians helping out. If you like these guys, you'll love this CD.
B000002J1U|4.0|After releasing the heavy metal classic Led Zeppelin II, just how would the band follow it up? Would they make another heavy album? Or would they attempt to branch out a bit? Well, thankfully, they chose to branch out, now don't get me wrong, I LOVED Led Zeppelin II, but repeating a formula can get quite tiring. On this album, the band experiments with more acoustic sounds, but worry not metalheads, there are still plenty of songs to rock out to! Now I warn you, you may not like this album upon first listen, but keep listening to it, it will grow on you, trust me. <br /> <br />The band may have softened on this album, but there are still some heavy ass-kickers on here, so worry not. One of these songs is the opener, Immigrant Song. Jimmy Page sure knows how to play recognizable riffs! Those opening screams by Robert Plant are CLASSIC. Celebration Day is another heavy tune. Jeez, if you ever question Jimmy's abilities, then just listen to this song and forget you ever doubted the guy! Out on the Tiles is heavy and mean. Jimmy sounds like he is pounding the hell out of his guitar, while Robert f*cking yells the chorus. What a voice! I am officially impressed now!  <br /> <br />Well that does it for the heavy songs. Now for the others. Friends has a bit of a country feel, Jimmy show off his excellent acoustic abilities here. John Paul Jones plays some pretty creepy synth sounds at the end. Gallows Pole sounds a bit like a rockabilly folk song, but Robert sings it very well, and it's a nice little tune to dance to. Bron Yr Aur Stomp is a country type of song. It's decent, but I tend to skip it, to be honest with you. Tangerine is another country-flavored song. It's nice and relaxing, Jimmy's guitar creates a nice, soft texture. Since I've Been Loving You has elements of progressive rock. It goes for about seven minutes, but it flows nicely and it doesn't feel tedious. Robert puts lots of emotion into this one, and the guitar notes that Jimmy plays here are amazing, I can't believe how he is able to play such melodies. That's the Way is a soothing, soft rock song that takes you to another world. In my opinion, it sounds as if his guitar is crying on this song. It's tough to describe, but you just have to hear it. It's the perfect song to relax to. <br /> <br />Hats off to Roy Harper is hated by a lot of fans, and I will admit that it is a bit odd, but it's not that bad! Jimmy plays some creepy and distorted riffs and Robert sounds like he is underwater. It's good to listen to every now and then, but it really is kind of underrated. <br /> <br />So overall, you need this album. Like I said earlier, this is not the kind of album that you can just like right away, you have to grow into it. And once you do, trust me, you won't get enough of it. This really is a brilliant and artistic album that everyone must hear! This is where, in my opinion, the band starts to change their sound into something that cannot be categorized. I mean, how would you place this album into a category? A hard rock, country, rockabilly, progressive, album? No no, we just don't categorize it. And to think that the band would push boundaries even further with albums like Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti, leaves me at a loss for words......
B000CPH9I4|4.0|When I heard that the Corrs were returning to traditional Irish music, I hoped for more of the up-tempo instrumentals like \\"Toss the Feathers\\" from Forgiven, Not Forgotten or \\"Paddy McCarthy\\" from Talk on Corners.  Instead this CD is mostly mid-tempo tracks with vocals - out of the 12 tracks there are two instrumentals and one track with vocals with a faster tempo and more rock influences. <br /> <br />I gave this CD 4 stars because after 3 or 4 listenings it's definitely grown on me, even if it wasn't what I hoped.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|No dramatic tension whatsoever, no surprises, hinges entirely on FX and computer graphics. Initially promises some tounge-in-cheek horror and witty one-liners but delivers an endlessly boring and intensely annoying barrage of loud horrible music, unsurprising explosions and silly CGI characters. Might have been ok much shorter and as a spoof. As it stands, it's not even a farce, it's just a rancid pile of vomit. It reeks - an actual cinematic turd! Am I being too harsh? - I could go on. As nutty as squirrel poo!
B000001FGG|4.0|'Spoonful' is the best guitar solo i have ever heard, this is incredible, i love Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing but i have never heard anything as powerful as 'Spoonful', most people tend to favour 'crossroads' on this CD but 'Spoonful' is by far the best track and really outstanding, i must add Ginger Baker sounds like an army of drummers on this track with an almost tribal rhythm and adds deepness to this song, i wouldn't forget Jack Bruce too, who is an excellent bassist with a sophisticated playing ; otherwise i give 4 stars and not five to the CD for the following reasons : on the studio side 'Those were the days', 'Politician' (good guitar solo, very haunting), 'Deserted cities of the heart' and 'white room' are good tracks but the others are not as good as these ones; Clapton is a better guitarist live than in the studio, the first two tracks of the live side are excellent, the two latter ones are less interesting (Toad and traintime).
0783114893|4.0|One of the best thrillers I have seen. The story might seem thin at places but it is very well put together and executed. Actors, locations and editing all help to make this a scary thriller.
B00005JNEI|1.0|An absolutely outrageous example of some greedy man making money by telling lies.  Famous people talking badly about our government will almost always get publicity, he went for it and made money.  In no way shape or form is any of his documentary true though.  Its a shame this is the way we work.  Rent the movie \\"homeland security\\" or something...dont waste your time here.
B00005MP58|5.0|Every scene captured as I had imagine when reading this book. <br />All actors perfectly portray all heros from the book. <br />Beautiful english scenery. Lovely music. <br />Marvelous movie.  <br />i will make all my girlfrinds and doughters to watch it.
B00001SIES|3.0|Although the first muse album i have ever bought was absolution, and i favor origin of symmetry to either...i feel like absolution is a pretty good album. Muscle museum is classic and i still get pumped listening to it. Yes Matt and thom do have a similar vocal style...but the biggest compliment is imitation right? But i don't think that muse is a rip off, perhaps they let their influences show a little more but it works. And for all those dissing radiohead and how they have no melody and aren't as emotional...you know its bull you just need something to whine about. Knowing the truth about which band is better overall or more important to the history of the musical world will only make you more mad if you know it's not muse. I think they are great but they could do without all the comparisons, but yes radiohead is better. And remember this: MUSE said they were a huge influence. SO before you diss radiohead remember that if it was not for them, they would not have helped inspired the music muse has made that you like so much. <br />Thank you.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardner is a very British movie, and yet the characters could've been from anywhere...the charcters are caught in a web of intrigue and corruption sponsored by a pharmaceutical company with severe ethical issues. Even though the end is fairly predictable, the emotional road that the story takes to get to its climax is beautifully written and the performances are amazing. Great movie!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Though the Oscars mostly ignored this film, it was one the best of 2005. The SFX were amazing and Naomi Watts turned in a great performance. I will be buying this DVD even though the Director's Cut will likely be coming out around the holidays.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|After seeing the movie \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", I was truly moved by the powerful love story between the two main characters, Jack and Ennis. This is one of the few films that kept me thinking days later. To me, there is nothing more refreshing than a movie that \\"takes a risk\\". This film was beautifully captivating in every way, and certainly portrays what it is to be in love, no matter what the circumstance. I guarantee that after watching this film, you will feel strongly about what you just witnessed, for me, the feelings were extremely positive. The bottom line is that this movie is really an experience, no matter what your opinions are on the subject matter.
0393327655|5.0|A wonderfully written book that makes no apology about the stand it takes - that religion is anathema to rational living, and following the Word (of various religions) written 100s of years ago can only sustain terrorism and hatred that has been unleashed today.<br /><br />Gives a coherent (though impractical?) and alternate theory if we were to expect living peacefully in the present times. However the book has more value for ruthlessly laying down on what is wrong with religion today - and why it will continue to be so unless some drastic changes are effected.
B00013F38K|5.0|The quality was very nice and the interviews with creators and actors from the show was awesome! It is sad that the men who played the Grandmaster and Master Po have pasted away, it would have been great to hear their stories too. Over all a great dvd series and a must have for any Kung fu fan. Five stars!
B0001IN07Q|4.0|The whole production is very amateurish. There is not one clear image from the concert. Michael's singing is the only saving grace here. If you're new to Buble, don't start with this one. Buble's new live concert DVD - Caught In The Act is awsome. For Michael's fans, this is still a delight. You can tell how much Michael's singing and live performance has matured during these short couple of years.
076790592X|4.0|A young man reconnects with a favorite professor, who now has a fatal disease. The professor continues to teach about the joy of living even while he is dying. A true story that is worthwhile reading.
B0006L16N8|1.0|It may be nothing really, just a british band that ripped off Radiohead, yet Radiohead still has better talent, better songs and a better singer. Yet female fans eat this crap up like they were the Beatles. Maybe its me but I cant find the talent even with CIA or CIS or FBI gear. Just listen to Ok Computer and listen to this album and tell me which one is better. <br /> <br />PS. The singer of Radiohead said that they are nothing more than pop and no skill.
B00003CXS4|5.0|As a 'Limey' i am blatantly going to be bias about this film, but it really is such a quality film it deserves all the good credit it receives. For not all British people live in huge mansions on their country estates and that a majority actually live in 'Sh*t holes'. I have a pikie camp site down my road and I have to say, for an american, Brad Pitt depicts the gypsy accent perfectly, though to all those who say you have to use subtitles to understand what Brad Pitt is saying, come to england and try actually talking to a pikie, you'll find it a lot harder without subtitles. To summarise, Guy Ritchie depicts Cockney London perfectly.
B000003TA4|2.0|Well this album rejuvenated rock and destroyed it as fast as it appeared. Kurt Cobain was not a tortured soul as many believe, he was a druggy who could not get his life together, did not want to be mainstream, yet he became. He killed himself to take the cowards way out, or maybe he was so high, he used his shotgun as a pipe and accidentally ignited the bullet that killed them. He was not a guitar hero, he barely played it in this album, the bass was only audiblw because Kurt could not play that well, yet the bass was boring and subpar. And the songs were written by a crack addict with inaudible singing and awful writing. <br /> <br />The only positive thing about Nirvana was Dave Grohl, his drumming was that made the band, quick, exploding drumming. At least he had the real talent in the band.
0307276902|4.0|Ok, so I enjoyed it and I don't care what O said, but I did find parts repeating, repeating, repeating...do you think he was having flashback while writing?
1573223026|1.0|This is definitely a book you would be advised to pass on. Could not become interested in the characters. Very contrived tale with no hook to hold it together. There are many more interesting tales to read.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act falls smack dab in the middle of all their albums for me. I hate none of their material so it's a good list to begin with. Anyways, Riot Act is most similar to Binaural but even then it's a unique entity of its own. Some of the songs on here, like Save Me or I Am Mine sound like classic Pearl Jam songs. Others, like You Are, Green Disease, or Bushleaguer, sound like classic Pearl Jam quarky songs. All of them are good and with good reason. <br /> <br />Some might say Vedder hasn't sung like he used to but I don't see how they get that. He's just singing a slightly different style than in the early days but he still does well live. Mike McCready has never failed to impress me and he has some very good solos, his best being in 1/2 Full. I think I also like Matt Cameron the best on the last two albums over any of the previous drummers they've had. He's pretty much an all around drummer who doesn't specialize in anything but rocking out.  <br /> <br />Back to the music, there's certainly not a bad song on here. My least favorite is Help Help but it's still very much listenable. Love Boat Captain is particularly touching because of its subject being those 9 lost souls a few years ago in that accident. From what I understand the track Arc is a tribute to them as well as it was a unique way Eddie learned to unless his emotions without words. It's quite soothing actually. <br /> <br />If you're a relatively new PJ fan who hasn't gotten to Riot Act yet let me reassure you by saying it's not their worst album and it still sounds like PJ. As I was getting the albums in order starting from Ten I kind of read reviews(both on here and elsewhere) for all the albums. I was sort of dreading getting to Binaural and Riot Act because some people seemed to have hated either one or the other. As it turns out Binaural is so close to topping Vs. as my favorite album and Riot Act is just below Ten for 3rd. There's less experimentation on the last two records then Vitalogy or No Code had and they're really a mix of the previous 5 albums. For really new fans I suggest to start from the beginning and work your way up but once you get here you won't be disappointed.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|i loved this movie! the soundtrack is great, too.  i may be the only one who thinks it is better than A&E's.
B00005JO1R|5.0|no question, these 2 deserve the oscar for this movie, what a story. great great great!!!!! this isn't a rental, this is a must buy! <br /> <br />i would give it 6 stars.
B00006RU5B|5.0|From 'Cochise' to 'The Last Remaining Light', every track is loaded with unlimited power.  It is amazing to me that this blend between the R.A.T.M. engine (Morello, Commerford, Wilk) and Soundgarden trademark (Cornell) is so simple and at the same time, so powerful.  You can't tell if it's RATM with a brand new singer, or Soundgarden with brand new musicians.  It is simply the best of both worlds. <br /> <br />I like this CD for driving.  Gets me focused on the road.
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|This cd is gorgeous, brilliant even..   Very impressive debut and can't wait to hear more from him.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Brokeback Mountain Soundtrack is caracterized by 3 elements: country, melody and calm. The songs are quite a collection of themes that will take us to Brokeback and make us remember every scene. An extraordinary compilation I might say. In between ol' classic songs (He Was A Friend Of Mine...) and the new ones, all made a perfect balance to the OST.  <br /> <br />Amusin' performances like Willie's on Dylan's He Was A Friend Of Mine makes you feel good. Emmylus Harris' A Love That Will Never Grow Old is a fave on. Faithfully and still delivetin' the whole movie theme it's perfect. Another great song is I Don't Want To Say Goodbye and also No One's Gonna Love You. Both amazing songs. All the scores provided by Gustavo S. are perfect situated in the movie and also it's perfect to hear.  <br /> <br />Other outstadin' songs are The King Of The Road and love It's So Easy. What else can be said? A soundtrack that is easy to hear is difficult to find considerin' that now a days almost every ST take songs of different styles instead of tryin' just one. This is one of those cases. Enjoy yourself! It's everything I can say for such perfect masterpiece.
B0000025RI|5.0|If you were to ask a cross-section of music fans from around the world, who in their opinion was/is one of the most influential and definitive pop stars of all time, most likely Michael Jackson's name would come up.  Granted, these days, he has been depicted as a very sad example of what the combination of bad press, bad (and excessive) plastic surgery and childhood demons can do to child stars, who make the transition to adulthood, and then end up bearing the burden of their broken--and, in some cases stolen--childhoods.  This is a price they pay to remain in the limelight.  However, \\"Thriller\\" is a warm, wonderful and brilliant album that brings us back to the days when Michael Jackson was still sporting the nose that God gave him (more or less), was cutting the rug up with the moonwalk, dressing to the nines in some very sexy--and flashy, might I add--suits and singing his heart out.<br /><br />What can I say about Michael that hasn't been said before?  Probably nothing!  What I can say is this, some of his most well-known and well-loved classic songs are on this great, Quincy Jones-produced album.  They include \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" and \\"Human Nature.\\"  The combination of Jackson's wailing falsetto, infectious, catchy, and memorable melodies and tight production make this album as great an example of musical genius today, as it was upon its initial release in 1982.  This music will make you want to dance, fall in love and hum along all at once!  Which reminds me.....I still need to buy my copy!  Check it out, people.
0345440900|4.0|Ignore the breast feeding advice - it is awful!  I would recommend this book to be used to learn how to get your baby on a schedule and how to read your babies cues.  But, do not read this book to learn anything about breastfeeding! <br /> <br />I really like the E.A.S.Y. schedule and I definitely think it has helped my daughter.
B00097DX3U|5.0|After listening to it the very first time, I said: \\"Where is the power here?\\".  Maybe because I like more heavier songs, the first impression was that is was more soft and less agressive than the previous self-titled album (and probably it is).  In nutshell, the 1st album sounds Rage-influenced, while \\"Out of Exile\\" sounds more alternative.  Now, after listening several more times, I started to dig'em.  Now I see that the whole album is just great.  <br /> <br />Cornell's singing is less agressive and more melodic (and I think more intelligent).  I think the albums arranges itself so Cornell's voice makes way for better music appreciation.  There are less agressive songs that the previous album.  This is more alternative-oriented I think.  However is has the trademark of Morello's impressive, inventive and breath-taking guitar work.  And of course, the combination of Commerford's bass and Wilk's drum work completes the circle. <br /> <br />'Out of Exile' is an excellent song with an excellent drive.  The drum work is one of the best of the album.  One of my favourites is 'Dandelion' for the way Cornell sings and '#1 Zero' for the ballad style start and the blasting overdrive in the second part of the song.  'Drown me slowly' is one of the agressive ones and one of my favourites.  Excellent bass lines. <br /> <br />One of the things I like from Audioslave is the fact that guitar soloing is still there and kickin' ass.  Weather you don't find that in today's rock music, Audioslave make it sound fresh and original.   <br /> <br />Make no mistake:  'Out of Exile' is way different from the previous album.  But I guarantee you will be blown away! <br /> <br />Supercat
B000B8QEZG|4.0|You've got to respect Madonna, she just keeps plugging away.  This is a must have for fans of pop, and fans of dance music.  Best are \\"How High,\\" \\"I Love New York,\\" \\"Hung Up,\\" and \\"How High\\" (said that one twice?  it's that good).  Ignore the self-important music snobs, buy what you like.  This is good music.
0316666343|4.0|This novel is an amazing debut for author Alice Sebold. It is very well written. Sebold's view on heaven and life after death is interestingly different from anything I have ever imagained. The main character Susie is raped and murdered and watches her family from heaven. Before I ruin the rest for anybody who has yet to read it, I will refrain from descibing any more. But, I would recommend this book for others to read if you are looking for a sad, heart warming book (I cried at least 5 times). Why 4 and not 5 stars? It was depressing with a non-satisfing ending.
B0007M22TI|5.0|It is probably the best concert I have watched on DVD!  I have watched it over 40 times...without exageration!  It is just so easy to listen to, relaxing, yet you can turn the sound up and really feel like you are there.  Great staging set-up, and lighting.  The voices are so perfectly blended together, and songs picked out that fit the singer's strengths.  I am most impressed with David Downs, director, and his arrangements.  I have purched 8 copies and gave to all my family members as gifts, and they all love it too!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I had the wonderful opportunity to hear this album on the way to \\"the city\\" one day.  Heard it, loved it, and bought it.  Her voice is a melodic wonder dancing with a classic instrumental jazz line. Thank goodness for random people that pick you up, take you to work, and share their good tastes in music.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|It's hard to know how Gustavo Santaolalla must have pleased the gods, that they have gifted him with the genius to write the score for this monumentally beautiful film.  My review addresses only the beautiful score cuts by Santaolalla, and unlike the review on the main page comparing them to \\"sonic wallpaper,\\" the cuts by Santaolalla will tear a hole in you, a hole which you may never again be able to fill.  The movie could not have succeeded without Ledger and Gyllenhaal, of course, but neither could it have succeeded without Santaolalla. Sublime, stunning, perfect.
6305897786|3.0|An awsome movie for those of us who like/love movies that embrase the dark side of life. If you  are looking for fast pace action, you won't get it here. This is a phycological thriller.
B0002858YS|5.0|i saw these dudes perform live and was decently impressed (ok, REM blew them away but they were decent). <br /> <br />i think their album trumps their live performances overall and would recommend this album to pretty much anyone. its very accessible/radio friendly and they deserve to sell million+ copies. lead singers got some good-great lyrics, guitar work is interesting and unique, the sound overall is fresh. its no wonder these guys have taken off, theyre the real deal, cant wait for the next album. <br /> <br />dont listen to the haters, this is a great pop album the whole family & family dog can enjoy.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|As someone who is late to jump on DCFC's bandwagon, I can't compare \\"Plans\\" with any of their previous work.  I'll leave that to the other reviewers of whom there are many.  However, I can thank KCRW's Nic Harcourt for getting me hooked on \\"Plans\\" after playing the track \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" during his \\"Morning Becomes Eclectic\\" program last week. It caught my attention and picked my curiosity.  In time, I'll go back and explore their earlier body of work. <br /> <br />In the meantime, however, \\"Plans\\" is full of well-crafted and wonderfully-written pop songs by the very talented Benjamin Gibbard.  From the first track, \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" through \\"Soul Meets Body\\" (my favorite) to the final track, \\"Stable Song,\\" the album is rich in lyric and melody -- and Gibbard sings with great diction, too! <br /> <br />\\"Plans\\" makes a great listening companion to Coldplay's \\"X & Y.\\"
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This CD has great tacks with Emmy Lou Harris, Willie Nelson, etc. <br />But I wish there was more of the orignal theme music.....the instrumental part, which is  laconic & lyrical & perfectly fits the theme & feeling of the film.
0307276902|5.0|After the very public situation with Oprah about this book, I recently completed this book.  I must say it was excellent.  I can identify with the author because I have a brother who is 38 and has been a drug addict since he was 13.  Drug addicts have their own intrepetation of what reality is.  Even though my brother and I were raised in the same house, his truth is much different than the actual reality of our youth. Very powerful and emotional book on the journey for author to get clean.

B000002U82|5.0|\\"And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.<br /><br />No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun....\\" - Time, Pink Floyd.<br /><br />It does not matter how old you are or where you come from or if you like to listen to a black guy rappin' or a DJ spinning on some decks or a man shaking his legs telling you that you are a hound dog or a dude with long hair thrashing on some strings singing about the tearing down the government with your bare teeth, in the CD store you could not have failed to miss the strange image of a prism with a color spectrum of light shining out of it, to hear it might not be the time or the place for you, but eventually one day you will remember the name Pink Floyd and Dark Side of the Moon and eventually have it on your iPod wondering how long you have spent living your life without it... and that is exactly why you have seen it always in those famous Top 10 lists.

B00005JOGU|4.0|Truman Capote's masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD (1965) set a new standard and style in the literary world. We know that he didn't finish another novel after it, too, which begs the question, \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />Fast-forward to the 2005 film CAPOTE and we get the answer.<br /><br />Mr. Capote is reincarnated in the body of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it is \\"through\\" him that we get to find out what happened during this snapshot time of Truman Capote's life. A vicious murder of a family in rural Kansas takes place and Truman races there to find out if there's a magazine story in it. But what he finds is much more than just a short periodical piece. As the murderers are captured, Truman becomes enraptured with the idea of learning why these seemingly innocuous men did something so heinous.<br /><br />Truman digs deep, perhaps too deep, and we watch as every shred of decency is stripped away from him just so he can \\"finish the story.\\" He bribes the prison warden and lies to the two killers (and ultimately to himself) about why he's really spending so much time with them on death row.<br /><br />In the end, it rips Truman apart, causing him to become an alcoholic and a shell of what he once was.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Occasionally casting directors get \\"it\\" right. And this time, they not only got it right by casting Mr. Hoffman in the role of Truman Capote, they bottled a bit of magic and captured it on film. David Strathairn did it, too, in his performance as Edward R. Murrow in GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, but Hoffman takes it to a euphoric level for movie watchers. His mannerisms, voice and costumes were impeccable. Many times I thought I was actually watching Truman Capote and not an actor playing him. Now that's great acting.<br /><br />If there was any failings in the movie, I'd have to say it was with its overall script. Although intriguing and genuinely creepy, it held only a small piece of what Truman Capote was. I realize that to capture all of what he was would be almost impossible ...but there you go. That's life.<br /><br />Even so, Hoffman deserves all the accolades he's gotten and I have no doubt he'll jump up on stage at the Oscars this year and pick up his statue.piece of what Truman Capote was.

B00005NNMK|4.0|Europe's 1986 album The Final Countdown was an excellent rock album for its time.  I still love the title song The Final Countdown and its intense, upbeat rhythm!  That dramatic guitar solo, where that guitarist lets it all out, is one of the best moments in '80s rock songs.They still play this song in some countdown like shows or the countdown to the new year. The only band that I can compare Europe to is Bon Jovi, with their own kind of anthemic, big choruses and heavy guitar leads. Rock The Night is the song that Jon Bon Jovi could have done on Slippery When Wet, its party themes so very strong here. The other songs are very formulaic sometimes, sticking to the same verse-chorus-verse pattern on most numbers.  Cherokee is the most catchy of those songs. Unfortunately, it peaked at No. 85 in the Billboard Hot 100, when the other three singles went top 10 or top 20. I love the dramatic power ballad Carrie, which is so elegant, the keyboards and piano sound gorgeous clashing with the loud guitars and Joey Tempest sings with such passion on it. Everything just all clicks in this song, even the songwriting. I just heard it recently--it still sounds fresh and superb a strong 19-20 years later. Unfortunately, Europe's later albums would never match their most creative peak. This is a party driven, energy heavy and melodically done rock album that anyone should get to hear how big the sounds of the '80 rock was. <br />

B00009RAJI|5.0|Albums generally do not become classic 20 years after they are released. They become classic a few years after their release, and their reputation continues to build from there. Such is the case with \\"Rumours.\\" When this album was released in 1977, it was the eclectic combination of rapid pop songs such as \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" combined with surreal Stevie Nicks' songs like \\"Dreams\\" that created an album that was able to realize the artistic ambitions of rock music.<br /><br />You could write a review only on the range of music on this CD. Given the number of artists collaborating on this album, you get a blues and country influenced song, \\"Never Going Back Again\\". There are lush orchestrated rock songs with strong blues influence like \\"Don't Stop\\". The quiet ballad \\"Songbird\\" sounds as though it would be at home in a lounge. \\"The Chain\\" with a strong bass backbeat shows influences from metal to blues. There are songs like \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" that would fit as easily into a country album as a rock album. \\"Oh Daddy\\" is another ballad that could be almost anything, but has elements of an abusive relationship. A dark, foreboding song. \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is another dark song, poetry and surreal images, rock as art as it can be.<br /><br />The very range of elements, and the excellence with which they are achieved, are why this album became great. Even though the album was recorded 25+ years ago, the variety and skill of execution plays well today, and allows a new listener to understand why this album is considered one of the greats.<br /><br />This particular variation has included \\"Silver Springs\\" between \\"Songbird\\" and \\"The Chain.\\"  \\"Silver Springs\\" was the B-side to the \\"Go Your Own Way\\" single.  This particular variation also has a second CD with songs that did not make the album, studio jams and various tracks that are included because they are available.  The second CD will be interesting to hardcore Fleetwood Mac fans; everyone else will likely listen once and then never take it out again.<br /><br />Generally I spend a significant amount of time going into what each song contributes, and how the music was performed and so on. However, this album is one of the few that requires little explanation. There are few albums that rise to the level of art that is readily accessible (as an example, I also consider R.E.M.'s \\"Automatic for the People\\" in this same category). This album is one of those. If you appreciate rock when it becomes art, and the great music in general, you must have this for your collection.ll likely listen once and then never take it out again. <br /> <br />Generally I spend a significant amount of time going into what each song contributes, and how the music was performed and so on.

B000002LQR|5.0|No CD collection is complete without \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". I can't think of anything else to type right now, but take my word for it---this CD owns.
B0000026J1|3.0|Europe's 1988 followup to their mega successful The Final Countdown was good.  But Ron Nevison doesn't really blend well with this band's sound in terms of the production.  Some bands he did albums for in the '80s Superstitious is still great, good midtempo rock.  But some of the other songs sound a little too dry sounding, sometimes bland at times.  Where The Final Countdown grabbed you with every song, this album has the same formulaic approach that Nevison gave to Heart's 1985 album. The album's best strength is the songwriting from Joey Tempest and the band members.  That's what saves it from becoming a complete flop. But this was anonymous in 1988 compared to Bon Jovi and other bands that had more success that year.
B0006L16N8|4.0|i just cant get into this one like i could the others. i dont find all the tracks listenable like i did on the other two albums. i dunno... but i get tired of the sound.    my fave tracks :: what if (awesome ending), fix you, x&y, low, hardest part.    i feel like those tracks break new ground whereas the others just continue to tread the same old water. im sure ill get a bunch of negative reviews by all the die-hards out there but whatever, thats my opinion (i actually have listened to/own every album before this one)    ps the guitar riff on talk is blatantly ripped off/COPIED from kraftwerk's \\"computer love\\" and it annoys me to no end... just credit the artist already!
B0002WYS6S|2.0|I'm a big fan of Dream Theater since the Images and Words days. However the last album of theirs I bothered to listen to was Scenes From a Memory. All subsequent material, for me, has lost its sparkle. The songs tend to drone on with overworked riffing. Instrumental sections overpower their sense of song writing. The keyboards parts are often irritating too, and overall the music doesn't suit their vocalists style. <br /> <br />Still I buy their stuff just for the amazement factor. So Live at the Budokan went on the dvd player. 50 mins later, after falling asleep, I woke to see they were still only on the fourth song of the set. I skipped to the 'instrumedley' - nice little set piece, then skipped to 'only a matter of time' then to 'pull me under' <br /> <br />Tried very hard to listen and watch the other songs, but not oly did they bore me to tears, the performance was so drab. John and John never once move over to each other. LaBrie does a good job, but his vocals do not suit the music. I love his voice but it is wasted in the current Dream Theater sound. Portnoy is exemplary. I can forgive static performance if the songs excite, but they don't. <br /> <br />Petruccis live sound has deteriorated, as has his studio sound and his vibrato sounds weaker than usual. Rudess plays effortlessly but his choice of keyboard sounds really spoil song atmospherics. <br /> <br />The second dvd was interesting, nice documentary and short interviews - Myung conspicious in his trademark silence. However everything felt personality-less. I was getting even more bored. <br /> <br />There's no fun in Dream Theater anymore, just guys churning out complex music with no charm or character and this was i'm afraid reflected by this live DVD. A momentary lull I hope <br /> <br />They still kick ass musically over just about anyone.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'd hardly ever paid to attention to the Lady M before this album. Then one day, my car broke down and I had to be picked up my wife. She put this CD on while driving us home. At the very first listen, I ended up loving it madly! The next day, I went on to buy a copy for my car. My wife is yet to stop teasing me since. Kudos to M!
B000002UB6|5.0|\\"Let It Be\\" doesn't get a lot of recognition, overshadowed as it is by the White Album and especially by \\"Abbey Road\\".  Despite  Phil Spector's orchestration on the record, this is the most stripped-down the Beatles' music ever got.  So it's understandable that most people favor some of the earlier Beatles albums over this.  Still, I maintain that \\"Let It Be\\" is one of their best, perhaps just behind \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Revolver\\".<br /><br />Almost every song on this record is amazing.  George's \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"For You Blue\\" continue his line of great contributions to Beatles albums, and John and Paul are still at their songwriting peaks.  At the same time, they let up from the depressed mood of the White Album and just seem to have a good time in the studio; even though the band was tearing apart at the seams it's not apparent from listening to the album.  Spector's much maligned \\"wall of sound\\" almost never gets in the way, either.  Only \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" sounds like filler to me, probably because it only consists of Paul's singing and Phil's orchestra and the melody isn't that great.  Everything else on \\"Let It Be\\" is terrific, though.  Don't let the negative reviews deter you; the songs here stand up to the Beatles' best work on their other late-period albums, they just have more stripped-down arrangements.
B000E8N690|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I thought this was a very powerful and expressful movie. It expresses why Johnny Cash was known as the man in black, and his struggles in his life. It lets you get to know who the real Johnny Cash was. It also allows you to see how Johnny fell in love with June Carter and how she \\"saved\\" him and became his angel. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a beautiful job portraying Johnny and June. I think more so Joaquin definately looked a lot like Johnny Cash, even the way he moved his mouth and how he talked was just like him. Both Joaquin and Reese took all their time and effort to sing and sound like Johnny Cash and June Carter. I think they did a beautiful job and Johnny and June would be proud!

B000002I6T|5.0|So nice...like sitting in a little cloud above everything, with a little bit of everything nice in life right there with you.  <br /> <br />I don't know. <br /> <br />As I sit here in my dormitory at 10:46 on Saturday morning after a night of regretful, joyous, interesting excursions I am listening to this album.  <br /> <br />It is so nice...so nice to listen to in the morning when there is just nobody but you in a room and all the lights turned off except a little orange tinted light in the corner, right there with you. <br /> <br />I just felt compelled to write this right now...It really does deserve more than the 60 reviews or so that it currently has on amazon. <br /> <br />Just buy it. It's not that much. You'll love it.  <br /> <br />Dreamy, hazy, smooth, beautiful... <br /> <br />People that do not enjoy this, I don't know. I just don't know. <br /> <br />It's a beautiful album, and should hold a place in your cd collection. Really.
B00005OAIE|2.0|Sorry for the pun, but it really seems like when John was writing  \\"Room For Squares\\", he forgot that songs are supposed to have melodies and be memorable.  This album passes me by completely every time I listen to it.  It sounds like Mayer is trying to get by on either nostalgic or frustrated lyrics (\\"My Stupid Mouth\\", \\"83\\") or pure atmosphere alone (most of the rest of the album.)  The atmosphere is pleasant, sure, but not enough to make the music interesting.<br /><br />Another problem is the production.  Every song on \\"Room For Squares\\" is drowned in echoey effects, making it impossible for the instruments to stand out.  It's obvious that John is a good guitarist, so why doesn't he play some audible lines?  As a result of the production and lack of melodies, I can't really tell one song from another; they all run into each other.  The only exception is \\"3x5\\", which has something like a melody and stands out from the rest for that.<br /><br />I'd only call a few of these songs truly bad, but this stuff isn't very good either.  If you want good acoustic rock from a new guitarist, look up Jackie Greene, who's closer to the old blues- and roots-rock tradition than John Mayer and has more melodies.  I'm seriously happy that so many people find meaning in John's music, but I can't get interested in it at all.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Eli Roth is quickly making a huge name for himself in the modern world of horror filmmaking.  With the debut Cabin Fever, Roth showed us his wide, unflinching knowledge of the great horror movies from the 70s and 80s that gave him his inspiration.  While Cabin Fever was more of an homage film, with story not really being the focal point, Hostel is pretty much a straigt-up horror film, and a great one at that.<br /><br />Josh and Paxton are two American backpackers in college who are taking a road trip to Europe to get away and relax before they both go into the next phase of their lives (law school, etc.).  Along their trip, they meet up with Oli, an Icleandic backpacker who is just as wild and offensive as the two Americans.  We aren't really engineered to care much about these main characters.  The first half of the movie is more about all the wild, deranged things that go on in Europe, and how easy it is to get women, drugs, or whatever you want.  Basically a soft-core porn film, the opening 45 minutes of Hostel serves purely as setup for the horrible, disgusting things that we all know are coming.  After visiting a hostel in Bratislava, Josh and Paxton get a little worried when Oli disappears without a word of goodbye or anything.  So they both set out to find out what happened to them, and they both get lured into the trap that has been set for many young, stupid foreigners to get what's coming to them.<br /><br />Once the torture sequences start, the movie changes completely, obviously.  Surprisingly, I found none of the gore really shocking, or anything that new to me, but then again, I have seen pretty much any horror movie you can name.  The gore isn't amazing, but the acting is surprisingly good, and the atmosphere is truly amazing, creepy, and disconcerting.  Rather than being a real \\"horror\\" film, this movie falls more into the \\"shock and disgust\\" category than it does into the scare category.<br /><br />Eli Roth really has grown as a filmmaker.  If you watch Cabin Fever, and then watch Hostel, you can see many differences that make Hostel a much better movie.  Hostel is much more suttle and controlled than Cabin Fever was.  Cabin Fever was so chaotic and random, that you didn't know what was going on half the time.  Hostel, on the other hand, knows exactly what it wants to do, and the entire movie is focused around making a singular point.  Also, I loved the ending of Hostel.  I know a lot of people who were disappointed and thought it was too cliched, but personally, I thought that it was a well thought out ending, and it didn't make the viewers leave the theater feeling absolutely depressed and suicidal.<br /><br />The other part of Hostel that I loved was a single scene near the end of the film, when one of the characters actually gets dragged into a conversation with one of the torturers.  This dialogue is great, and it is with this dialogue that Roth makes the point he wants to make with this movie.  You can really take any point you want out of it, but I felt that Roth was trying to send a message about human nature, and the dark rivers that run throughout each of us at certain moments of time.  Let's just say that Sigmund Freud would love this movie.If you watch Cabin Fever, and then watch Hostel, you can see many differences that make Hostel a much better movie.

B000BAQ8A0|5.0|A stunning performance by Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Florez as Count Almaviva makes this DVD of \\"Il Barbiere Di Siviglia\\" well worth it. He has a smooth and nimble voice and makes the most of this good Rossini tenor role. The audience in Madrid really expresses its appreciation after his brilliant aria \\"Cessa di piu resistere\\" near the end of the opera. One cannot ask for a better Almaviva than Florez, who incidentally studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia in the mid-1990s before his career took off. I also liked Maria Bayo as Rosina, Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro and Bruno Pratico as Bartolo. There are some quirks in the stage presentation, which definitely has a European feel, but nothing that undermines the opera. But this one will be remembered for Juan Diego Florez's radiance.
B00006GO9Q|4.0|I initially came to Miles Davis through the \\"traditional jazz\\" of the late 50's and early 60's such as the work of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins.  When I heard \\"In A Silent Way\\", I was expecting the same sort of music, not knowing anything about the fusion style Davis created in the 1960's-70's.  This album, then, came as a bit of a shock.  I slowly came around to enjoying it after getting used to its unique style.<br /><br />\\"In A Silent Way\\" includes some instruments that had not been standard in the jazz style before, such as electric piano, organ and electric guitar.  The title of the album is fitting: the two pieces create a peaceful and calming mood but at the same time manage to be musically interesting.  You can listen closely to the record or alternatively relax or study to it, letting it work its great atmosphere.  Either way, the trumpet, saxophone, electric piano and guitar constantly weaving on top of a light drum pattern build an excellent listening experience.<br /><br />The only complaint I might have about the album, which I have heard from others, deals with the repetition of the long intros to both pieces.  The choppy editing makes the intros feel merely tacked onto the ends of each.  Still, it's not a big deal.  If you want something in this style that's giant and ambitious, get \\"Bitches Brew\\".  \\"In A Silent Way\\" is sort of slight by comparison, but it's definitely worth having.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|I haven't heard the whole CD, but I've rated it according to what I have: <br /> <br />1. Hung Up - Basically, they've taken the riff from the classic Abba song, placed it over a simple 'club' beat and added predictable lyrics in an attempt to personalise it. This is a blatant cash-in, revealing Madonna's lack of ideas shockingly(well not really, in today's popular musical climate). <br /> <br />3. Sorry - Yuck. With weak, predictable lyrics, it doesn't stand out from the countless other written-in-5-minute pop songs out there, not one bit. Even has foreign words spoken to try & add some variety. Doubt she's proud of this piece of CRAP. <br /> <br />5. I Love New York - stupid, childish & downright lazy lyrics, but nice dirty pop vibe saves this... <br /> <br />8. Jump - Real nice, catchy, positive pop with decent lyrics, harking back to the Material Girl's former glories. <br /> <br />On a side-note: all comarisons between Madge & Mariah should cease. Mariah has the greatest voice of the last 10 years, is an R&B singer and writes all her own lyrics. Anyone who thinks music sales determine the talent of an artiste is badly short-sighted. Most of the best singers, musicians & producers will never even enter a Grammy award ceremony.

B00005JNX0|3.0|This movie isn't as good, funny and exciting as I thought it was gonna be. The best part in the whole movie for me is the one with more funny scenes, more action and jokes, and that part happened to be the first sequence, when the animals are in the zoo. If you watch the trailer, most of it happens in the zoo, and only a couple of scenes in the trailer are in the island, and it looks really funny.<br /><br />When I watched it, I thought it may have been funnier, but it's quite boring, instead. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this movie to kids, because it's very \\"innocent\\".<br /><br />If you want to watch an animated movie which is cool for the whole family, watch \\"The Incredibles\\", instead of this one, instead of \\"Shrek\\"
B000002C25|3.0|Be Here Now is a problematic record. And its problems derive almost wholly from the fact that it was preceeded by two essentially flawless pop/rock records. If it had been released as a debut, Be Here Now, would be hailed as 'promising', and full of potential. Good songs, well played and produced. A little self-indulgent, but sure to lead to good things. <br /> <br />However, as we all know, Be Here Now did not lead to good things. In fact, Oasis began a lengthy period of relatively directionless music making, and many of those who hailed the band at their onset lost interest. <br /> <br />History hangs heavy over this record, which in many, many ways parallels the fate of The Doors' Waiting For The Sun. A moderately good record met by overwhelmingly high expectations. <br /> <br />Masterpiece it is not. Disaster it is not. It could be a lot better, and it could be a lot worse. Anyone predisposed to the Oasis sound and style wlll find much to enjoy here; newcomers will scratch their heads, and should be pointed towards Definitely Maybe and What's The Story (Morning Glory)?
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This is an excellent remixes CD, much better than \\"Outrageous Remixes\\", and the new song \\"And Then We Kiss\\" is really, really good.

B00000DHRX|3.0|It's a good set, worth more than I paid for it on Amazon, but I was very disappointed with the version of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" they used for this album. This is not the version we heard on the charts, and I can't imagine why they did this. It's a trumped-up yet watered-down variation with none of the punch or magnetism of the original. Bad move.
B00005Y228|5.0|I own a couple of Kylie Minogue's albums, but the first one I bought was the special edition fo \\"Fever\\" and I totally loved it! This album isn't like the regular, dumb pop, this is like a fusion between pop and dance, and the result is a perfect album.<br /><br />There are some people who say that this CD sucks and it's awful and all the stuff. If you hate it this much, why are you even watching the page about it?. I bet they haven't even heard this CD, because if they ever do, they'll change their minds about it.<br /><br />The single selection was very well done, but I think that \\"Love Affair\\" could have been an excellent single, too.<br /><br />Favorite songs in this album: All of them, except \\"Give It To Me\\".<br /><br />I wasn't too sure when I got this album, because I only knew the singles, but then I listened to it and it turned out to be very impressive. The people who don't own this album are missing half their lives!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Uma Thurman, as well as all supporting cast, is amazing in this film.  Not for the squeamish, this film has a strange choreography that compels the viewer to hold on to their seat.  Good sound track too.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This album rocks.  Five stars.   Everyone is saying they've returned to form - they never slipped in my opinion.  The Strokes are the strongest rock band around, and this album proves it.   I don't know which blows me away more - the lyrics or the music.   The singles released thus far, Juicebox and Heart In A Cage, are not even the strongest tracks on the album - although they are great songs.  They've improved their craft in all ways.   The guitars are amazing.  The typical Strokes strumming by Albert is laid under yet more amazing picking work from Nick.  Rhythym section is very strong as usual.   <br /> <br />The songs have a great mix of meaningful and real lyrics and great music.  Nobody can touch them right now.  If you want to be picked up, listen to the music.  If you want beautiful poetry which offers some grim observations listen to the lyrics.  If you want a top notch album, pick this one up.  You won't put it down for quite a while.
B000002JOF|5.0|This album is an excellent piece of music, one of my favorite actually out of 100s of CD I own.  Its style is difficult to pin in any well defined category, not really rock, not really jazz, no really blues and all of the above at the same time.  But what's extraordinary about it is that even though it is probably 20 years old, that music could have been composed today or probably tomorrow as well.   There is something powerfully universal about it.  Definitely a strong mood music for the night, even better, for driving long hours into the night.
B000000OAN|5.0|As a relatively new fan of Queen, I'm glad this was my first album of theirs that I bought. After being hooked one night by Bohemian Rhapsody, I ran out the next day to buy A Night at the Opera and was pleasantly surprised (upon extended listening). As usual, with every CD I get, I usually hate most of the songs on it the first time I hear them, and I started to regret buying this one almost immediately. Especially after seeing that I could've gotten a Greatest Hits CD at the next store. <br /> <br />But after heavy listening, I finally grew to love this album. Of course, Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the main highlights, but there are many great tracks on this one: <br /> <br />(The song ratings everyone puts on their review): <br />1. Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to..... - I heard this one before I got the CD and hated it. After several more listens, I began to like it more. Someone really had it in for whoever this song was dedicated to..... 4/5  <br /> <br />2. Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon - A short-and-sweet jingle. It gets stuck in your head after a while. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. I'm In Love with My Car (and 1991 remix)- Good song, but nothing special. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. You're My Best Friend (and 1991 remix)- Another catchy, light-hearted track that I first heard in that commercial for something I don't even remember... 5/5 <br /> <br />5. '39 - One of the best songs on the CD. Brian sings this one really well and its one of his best, along with The Prophet's Song and Good Company. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Sweet Lady - My least favorite song on the CD. Again, nothing special. 2-3/5 <br /> <br />7. Seaside Rendezvous - Another light-hearted tune by Freddie, who hits some high notes in this one. 5/5 <br /> <br />8. The Prophet's Song - Brian's 8-minute long epic is in my top 3. It is divided into several stages not unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, the middle portion consisting entirely of Freddie multi-tracking his voice for about 2 minutes. Supposedly, it tells the story of Noah and the flood. Very well written and executed. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. Love of My Life - Harps play an important role in Freddie's love ballad, which seems to transition from The Prophet's Song perfectly. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. Good Company - This one is really underrated. Brian plays the ukelele as he tells a story of keeping good company all his life, but ending up alone in the end, anyway. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. Bohemian Rhapsody - I won't bore you with what everyone has been already saying for 25+ years, so I'll just tell you it's a great multi-layered tune. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. God Save the Queen - OK. I don't really see the point of it, other than it having the band's name in it. Just an adaptation of the song by Brian on guitar. 3/5 <br /> <br />I'm still getting into Queen, so I can't tell you bored readers of my review if this is their best album, but various sources will tell you it is. In my opinion (which no one cares about anyway), I would highly recommend it. The band did a great job.
0913866156|5.0|I heard about the Thoth Tarot Deck long ago and learnt about it via the interpretations by Gerd Ziegler, who describes each card in detail. But I had never seen them with my own eyes. Luckily the time came when I decided to buy them. They surpassed the expectations built by Ziegler's descriptions. I've been using a number of other Tarot decks. Buying the Thoth Tarot was like buying a new computer equipped with all the new programs and having all the new facilities - eye-opening, exciting, bright and unlimited like the world itself - with my understanding only few of them... The symbolism of the Thoth Tarot deck also surpasses my knowledge of the occult, which is restricted to astrology and some Jungianism and which is short of Kabbalah so important for understanding Aleister Crowley's creation. But this is not the problem of the cards.

3937406328|5.0|Chris Rea is a musician's musician - in other words, musicians recognize him for much more than a few hit songs and a tasty slide guitar. He has the heart of an artist and something even more important - INTEGRITY. I have just received \\"Blue Guitars\\" and have barely had time to listen to but a few tracks. I began by watching the DVD which only whetted my appetite to immerse myself, over time, in the whole project. What is immediately apparent is that Rea has not shirked his responsibility to be true to his own musical vision and also to the expectation of his fans who have come to expect exemplarary musicianship as well as audio excellence. A sample if somewhat cursory listening has confirmed my suspicions. \\"Blue Guitars\\" is a work of mammoth proportions and emotional depth. I fully intend to update this review over time as I am sure this is a journey that is going to take a while.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The extra 15 minutes is highly distracting. Eli Wallach's voice has changed considerably over the decades, and it is very annoying. Those extra minutes do explain some of the plot holes throughout the movie, but does very little else. If you can find the original release, which I just found on Amazon, minus the extra footage, then go for that DVD and save yourself some money. I love the movie, but those extra minutes don't explain Eli's voice sounding oneway one minute and something totally different the next.
B00006BTCA|5.0|My music taste was awful at the tender age of 23 and I never really had a passion for music.  I liked music at the time but never really craved it.  I saw Interpol's video for \\"Obstacle 1\\" and it stopped me in my tracks.  I had never heard anything so haunting and powerful in my entire life.  I listened to the whole song and it echoed in my ear for the rest of the day, constantly bringing a smile to my face.  The next day I purchased the album and it has remained my #1 favorite album in my collection.  Since that purchase I have been on a neverending search for untapped music and have found a true passion for it thanks to this beautiful band.  This is a great album to listen to at midnight with a bottle of wine and a group of friends.  Puts you in a good vibe, highly recommended!!!
1593974744|5.0|This is an outstanding audio CD.  The book is excellent;add to that a stunning audible performance and an interview with the author and you have hours of fascinating literature massaging your eardrums.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself talking the scenic route so you can get a few more minutes of audio on your daily commute!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|In the reviews of their 2 albums, I have seen them appear with The Beatles, The Kinks, The Doors, The Clash, Marc Bolan, David Bowie, Joy Division, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Josef K, etc., for bad. Tell the truth, I have heard a lot of records of them (Josef K excluded) and I surely do not think FF is imitating any of them, let alone rip-off. There is something called influence. I can tell FF are influenced by 70's-80's (who aren't? I bet if internet and digital music were prevailing in that time every gonna-be-great band we worship now would be abused to death by the reviewers), and they do have made their own trademark sound which is catchy, cool, and distinctive while all the other Brit-new-pop bands are just some different retarded versions of Blur and Radiohead. Our time is cursed. There are no CLASSICS after the turn of the new century. What we got in these 5 years is almost less than what we got in three months in 90's. Nevertheless, FF's debut has made a difference in this recession of rock and will be mentioned more and more in the future.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|...as others have mentioned, this CD is copy-protected, meaning once bought, you can't exercise your right as the owner of the CD to do as you please with its content (i.e., rip it to your hard drive, put it on your iPod). <br /> <br />I encourage all prospective buyers to boycott this CD on principle.  Like all major industries (some with more egregious agendas than others), the music industry is rife with avarice and scum.  Regardless of what the band or their label contends, this stuff is public domain once released, and they have NO RIGHT to limit the accessibility or manipulation of the material once purchased by the consumer. <br /> <br />Being legally blind, I missed the copy-protection denotation on the back of the CD (\\"the big print giveth, the small print taketh away\\").  I only discovered this when I attempted to rip it to my iPod.   <br /> <br />Feeling bullied and victimized, I went back to Virgin Megastore and DEMANDED they give me an exchange.  The glib cashier initially gave me a problem.  But I was livid, and I refused to accept \\"no\\" as an answer.  I debated adamantly with the store manager until she caved and granted me an exchange (I got \\"Hemispheres\\" by Rush, which not only contains much better music, it's also NOT copy-protected). <br /> <br />The moral of the story: even if you've already purchased this disc and are bummed you can't put it on your iPod, don't accept the fate of having wasted your money.  Go back to the store from where you bought it and, as the consumer who works hard for his/her money, DEMAND they either give you a credit or an exchange.  As the CONSUMER, you have rights, so FIGHT for them! <br /> <br />Lastly, if the retail rep gives you BS and attempts to place the blame on you instead of the record label for \\"assuming the risk of buying the copy-protected CD,\\" don't budge.  It's the RETAILER who assumes the burden/risk of carrying the label's junk product, thereby likely incurring the wrath of angry consumers who feel jipped(sp?).  They (the retailers) should know better, and they undoubtedly do. <br /> <br />I'd truly like to review \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" for its music, which is neither great nor bad.  It's decent.  But it's the UGLY LIE on the part of the band's label which gives this a crappy rating.  And if the band has any integrity, they'll address the copy-protection issue and do their best to make the fans happy. <br /> <br />'Nuff said.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|its been sometime since i've seen a movie like this...i've seen a speacial about KIN KONG and Peter Jackson said that he is working on a new version of it,but never thought it will be that good.. a copy of it will always be in my library when it relase on DVD..
0307276902|3.0|After all the hype calmed, I read this book. It is an excellent book and has some good insight into the world of contemplative recovery.  Whether the events are true or not did not effect the impact of how difficult early recovery is.  Parents of addicts may want to read this book just to gain some perspective on how the addict must own their behavior, and they were probably not \\"bad parents\\"
B000001FS3|5.0|This CD was recommended by a friend and I purchased it.  I love it!  It is very good, in fact, it's excellent!  I would highly recomment it to anyone else.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I must say that I never have seen the theatre version, only the director's cut, which is claimed to have the \\"better\\" ending. This haunting movie left me in awe. Original story, developed characters, and an indulgence into the \\"what if\\" make this an excellent movie. My opinion of Ashton Kutcher's acting had never been too high, and then I saw this movie. I have a new respect for the man who I thought was only a one dimensional actor.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This film zips by so fast because it's full of interesting dialogue and intense action. If you like comic books, you are bound to enjoy this film! I personally prefer Kill Bill 2, but this is classic Quentin with a whole lot more action! Part 2 really opens up the characters and dialogue, while still keeping the action intense and prevelant.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Old School, One of the Most Hilarious Comedies You'll Ever Witness<br /><br />If you have not seen the comedy \\"Old School\\" then you are missing a great laugh. With Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson as the stars of the movie, you will not be disappointed with this two-hour long stretch of pure fun. This movie, while some parts are quite fictional, relates well to college students, especially those in a fraternity or sorority. Will Ferrell (Frank) and Vince Vaughn (Beanie) long to relive their college years at their friend's expense. Luke Wilson (Mitch) buys a house on a college campus, because he wants to get away from his broken relationship with his wife. Mitch comes home at the beginning of the movie to find her sleeping with another man. Frank and Beanie create the brilliant idea that they will start a college fraternity on this campus, but they run into a terrible problem because the dean remembers how ruthless these men were to him in college, and he is trying to get rid the campus of them. As three older men, who once lived the college life, try to start a fraternity, they meet many challenges with the college's administration. The challenges that these men endure are what make the movie so funny. In one scene of the movie, Frank loses his wife because of the time he spends at the fraternity house. \\"Old School\\" is a great movie based purely on the non-stop laughter you will have. Between the challenges of the commencement of the fraternity and the everyday lives of Frank, Mitch, and Beanie \\"Old School\\" gives every audience a sense of humor about their own lives. Not only is the movie hysterical in and of itself, it illustrates to everyone that life should not be taken so seriously. In the end, Mitch gets the girl that truly loves him, and Frank is finally happy once he becomes the president of the fraternity. Beanie goes back to his normal life of selling audio equipment, but he still lingers around the fraternity that he helped build. The final moral to the movie is how the founders of the fraternity take care of the students they pledged into the fraternity. Yes, the pledgeship that these students endure is quite comical, but when they are faced with being expelled from school, the three founders and all the students in the fraternity are what push them through the tough times. This is a movie that you must see if you enjoyed your college years and if you just need a good laugh.the movie is how the founders of the fraternity take care of the students they pledged into the fraternity.

B000CCD0FS|5.0|I highly recommend all the TH re-releases. they sound amazing in 5.1 surround and the music itself is both creative and memorable in this age of drum machine/obscenity rap and turn-up-the-amps-and-scream alt. rock. No modern band even comes close to what the TH did from 77-89 and these re-issues prove that.
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantly complex<br />The importance of one's lifestyle is relevant only to the beholder, but in this film many things are brought about.. Pleasantville's monotonous lifestyle was anything but arduous or complex. When David (Toby Maguire) and Jennifer (Reece Witherspoon) are accidently thrown into the TV world of Pleasantville, things start to change. The functioning utopia begins to disspate. Authority is questioned, materialism is emphasized, and the comforting phrase to so many, ''ignorence is bliss'', is suddenly a dream once more. Although David liked the utopia, Jennifer saw the potential of variety in the lives of the Pleasantville citizins. This is a great movie. Once someone can see past the simple things, a film can really shine as this one does.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've been listening to music for 20 years, right and left, up and down, heavy and light, classical and modern, smooth and rough...... <br />By no overstating or stretch, THIS IS THE BEST CD I OWN!!!! <br />You can get used to some music after listening to it 1,233,849,545,329,,832,232,293,573.00 times!!  <br />But I can't get used to or enough of this CD, after 8 years of regular listening to it, it's still unbelievable, maaaan!
B000286RKW|5.0|a cheesey statement but if you don't like this film your not from earth or you don't speak english...<br /><br />From the Godfather to Goodfellas<br />Probably the best movie I have ever seen. I first heard of 'Goodfellas' about a 4yeaes ago and I thought that it was just 'another' movie but when I first watched it I was hooked. I personally love gangster-mobster movies because all the members of the mob stick together and that's a quality that's hard to come by these days. They take care of their own business one way or another. This movie is probably the best mobster flick ever made also. Without a doubt, it's hard to capture the raw nature of an organized crime but with the help of Marty Scorsese, (also director of Meanstreets) he captured that quality and made a beautiful work of art. With the help of actors Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas has become my all time favorite and I recommend it to anybody but there are some scenes that may be to graphic so put the kids asleep before watching this great movie!<br /><br />Also Recommended: The Godfather 1&2
B00003CWPL|5.0|Dark, distorted, and disturbing feeling like a nightmare with structure but no logic. It repulses and attracts all at the same time as yuo wait in anticipation for the next bizzar thing to happen.  <br /> <br />The gist of the story is this. It centers on the main character Henery. A quiet, shy, easily minipulated young man with a strange taste in hair styles. It basicaly starts out with him going to his girlfriends parents house for dinner. The characters here are strange yet likable especially his girlfriend Mary's father. Forget about any bad time you've ever had meeting the parents for the first time, Henery's includes a bleeding half alive chicken and the knowlege of him being a father. The story then flashes to Henery's place where Mary and the baby are living. Only problem is that the baby was premature and looks more like a skinned alien then anything you would want to call cute. Mary looses her patients one night and leaves suddnely to go to her parents where she can get a decent nights sleep without a baby crying. Here Henery takes responsibility and cares for his baby who is now sick. The rest of the story is a daze of absolutly bizzar situations including a singing lady who lives in the radiator who likes to dance to old roller ring music while stepping on and squashing small embryo looking creatures with unbilical cords still attached.  <br /> <br />I dont want to give the ending away but it does keep in line with being as stranges as the rest of the movie. As I said there is no logic to the movie and really no plot either. Keep in mind that it's a nightmare and it makes a little more sence. A must see at least once. You may want to rent it first though just to make sure this is your cup of tea. But keep in mind that it's one of thoes movies that grows on you the more you see it as all cult classics are I guess
0790729393|5.0|Not Just A Story But A True ForTell Of Courage And Friendship.<br /><br />This movie has gone straight throught my Heart and nerves leaving me with goosebumps. To Watch shuch a unbelievable true story but with a horrible concept is gripping. You cant help but watch it again and again. This story of true friendship will leave you thinkin of the true meaning of life. How it is not just somestuff that happens in life but true fellings that do matter. I can only urge you to see this movie and its incradible story. It will have you mezmarized as you see things you never thought possible come alive in front of your eyes. It will leave you in tears.This is only my opinion. You have to decide for yourself. I can only say you will never see life the same way again.

B00005JOFO|2.0|I've read many of the reviews here, and the sense I get is that more people than not are applauding the importance of being open to all forms of love, and not just hetero-love. And I couldn't agree more with that concept. It is also important that more of the world be exposed to the concept that same-sex couples can love each other. I couldn't be more supportive of that either. So regardless of whatever negative comments are made about my review, I want to say up front that I am 100% supportive of gay rights, gay marriage, gay love, and gay folks being treated exactly the same as straight folks. Nuff said. <br /> <br />But now I'm going to talk about this movie. I went into it really wanting to love it. I was so happy that a movie had been made featuring gay (or at least bi) men as the focus of this romance, and that it had been nominated for so many Academy Awards. I had high hopes. However just as far as rating it as I would rate any movie... forgetting the fact that it has such a groundbreaking gay theme... I really felt that the movie did not hold up to what I would expect for any Oscar nominated movie. I felt that the character development was so cryptic that I never understood what these two men loved about each other. I wish there had been more up-close scenes where I was shown special moments between the two, so that I could see how their love built. Instead, the story just jumped forward with starts and stops, showing them fishing, swimming, rough-housing, and whatever... but it wasn't the kind of stuff that made me feel like I understood either of them. I would expect this from any romance movie. I also felt that the jumpiness of the storyline got in the way of the entire movie. It wasn't a smooth storytelling experience. Little bits here and there, and a myriad of partially-developed characters or plot developments that never were fleshed out. I felt that the director should have focused on fewer directions, and given just those a bit more depth as a whole. The B.M. boss coming up the first time to discuss a sick uncle, but they stay up there, and there was no further mention of the uncle. And then the boss coming up a second time and telling them that they were to leave the mountain early. Why? If he were so incensed by their relationship, he should have just said something the first time. What's with the clutter of this uncle news? And the main fella has two daughters for the first half of the movie, but in the second half, only one is around with no mention of the other. Why? And what was the point of her asking if she could live with him, and then being so agreeable when he says no? I just don't see what these things added to the storytelling experience. I'm only naming a few of these examples that for me, cluttered up the movie from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />I believe that if this movie had been made about a straight couple, that it would be pulled apart completely by the critics. That the lack of character development and the director's storytelling style would not hold up to the standards generally held by great movies. And that it is simply the fact that the two main characters are men, that is causing so many people to praise it so highly. And again -- I am totally supportive of movies embracing the subject of gay romance. And I am delighted that this is a mainstream example of gay men that don't fit into the stereotypical effeminate Queer Guy for the Straight Guy mannerisms that seem so prevalent in movies/tv in general.  <br /> <br />For me, the bottom line is just one of disappointment. I really wanted to love this movie, and really felt that it failed. I'm going to give it two stars though -- one for the subject matter and one for the scenic vistas. And I will hold out hopes that this movie will end up being the first step towards mainstreaming this subject matter, so that future genuinely great movies can be made featuring gay themes.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I love this album. I have been listening to their music for countless years, and never tire of it. All the songs here are true classics. Everyone here contributes in their own way.I would place this album as my favourite Fleetwood Mac album (of the Nicks/Buckingham era). This is the album that contains most of Fleetwood Mac's best songs. There is \\"Rhiannon\\" that features Stevie Nicks on lead vocals. Go Your Own Way, Dreams,The Chain, Don't Stop and most of their best music. Beside defining 70's hit radio, they were highly influential. You can hear how the next generation of people were influenced by their songwriting style. Just listen to 10,000 Maniacs, Jewel, REM, Smoke Ring Days, Sheryl Crow and dozens of others who were consciously or unconsciously hearing this music. The music of Fleetwood Mac is simply great. their voices, the lyrics, the melodies, the instrumentation, everything.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|There's no word on what the significance of Ryan Adams' guitar, a Valdez snowtiger custom is, but one thing is for certain: From the opening track of disc 1, he's able to squeeze a wicked imitation of that distinct Jerry Garcia sound from it.    Both CDs contain echoes of \\"American Beauty\\", both in the sound of Adams' guitar and in his voice.  I read one or two reviewers who said this isn't an ode to Jerry. If you have any doubt about that, just read the lyrics to \\"Rosebud\\".  For the uninitiated, \\"Rosebud\\" was Jerry's favorite guitar, and, as Adams' sings in this poignant tribute to Jerry and his guitar, Rosebud now sits behind a glass case at the Rock n roll Hall of Fame in Ohio.    Unfortunately, only about half of the songs on these two CDs have that Jerry vibe, and as someone else wrote in a review, it would have made for a more consistent album if he had left only those on the CD, even if it meant 9 or 10 songs instead of 18 or 19.      If he'd done that, I would have given it 5 enthusiastic stars.  The Dead influenced songs alone make for a worthy successor to American Beauty.  In spite of the fact that about half of the songs here don't really belong, \\"Cold roses\\" is still definitely well worth buying.
0316172324|5.0|This book is a revalation in new thinking!  Easy to read, although I read it in one sitting.  We just need to trust our instincts, and say \\"I don't know\\" more often.  Buy it!!!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|When it gets rolling, \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" is perhaps the most difficult movie to watch in the history of film.  This is nominally a movie about addiction.  The four main characters each have their own drug problems - three out of four are addicted to heroin, and the last (Ellen Burstyn in a heartbreaking performance) to metamphetamine crash diet pills.  But this is not just a drug movie.  No, the truth is in the title - this is a movie about people whose dreams, simple harmless fantasies, are completely destroyed.  As such, the movie is ugly, unflinching and sometimes painful to watch.  If you have the slightest amount of humanity, you will feel the characters' despair as your own. <br /> <br />A large amount of the credit for this goes to great performances from actors who don't normally get such good roles - you can feel the desperation in each of them, their performances are so scarily plausible.  Watching each deteriorate into their own mental and physical hell is the part of the impact of the movie, and each pulls it off nicely.  The remainder of the credit is divided between director Darren Aronofsky, whose brilliant experimental style plants you in the characters' psyche, and Clint Mansell, whose score alternates between an elegaic string part (which has now been used in everything from car commercials to the trailer for the Lord of The Rings trilogy) and pounding, incessant techno, both of which serve to emphasize the numerous forms of agony that are central to the film. <br /> <br />Is it easy to watch?  No.  The drug use is more graphic than anything seen on film before (including Trainspotting), there is  intense violence and a sex scene which is both physically and morally sickening.  For what it is, is it perfect?  No.  Both Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly are forced to work with characters that are slightly underdrawn in favor of the admittedly more powerful stories of Jared Leto's and Ellen Burstyn's roles.  But is it compelling? Yes.  Important? Yes.  This movie will stay with you for the rest of your life.  I can think of no better way to persuade someone to never, ever do drugs in their lifetime than showing them this film.  It's that powerful.
B000BT97AO|5.0|After looking forward to this film for over a year and a half, being a fan of Gaiman in particular, I finally got a hold of the DVD on Tuesday and finished it last night. What an unforgettable, unique, moving and just mindblowing experience! Truly one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. The story is pretty simple, a young adolescent girl with angst and rebellious feelings towards her parents is plotting to run away from her life and seek something more normal. Perhaps this theme sounds a bit too typical, but rest assured, that's where familiarity ends. This girl, Helena, lives with her parents who own and operate a circus/tivoli, and she helps out with her juggling act. 'Mirrormask' starts out with Helena writing a letter, sort of a diary entry, explaining her frustration with her parents. Shortly thereafter Helena confronts her mum about her attitude towards the circus and the heated discussion ends quickly without any resolve. They go about their business and get ready for the nightly performance. As misfortune would have it, moments later Helena's mum falls ill and the evening's grand event must be postponed as she shockingly discovers her mum collapsed on the ground. From here on out, Helena's life seems to falter, and she regrets the silly, irrelevant argument that she had with her mum just moments earlier, and not telling her how sorry she is for what she said. Her dad and the circus crew comfort her and reassure her that she has done nothing wrong and that she mustn't blame herself. Helena's mum is taken to the hospital and Helena stays with her grandmother in the mean time. Daily visits to the hospital becomes the order of the day, and Helena becomes increasingly worrisome. She deals with her pain through art, drawing in her room and on of the roof of her grandmother's apartment complex. One day as she's drawing, she falls asleep on top of the roof, and at that moment she enters a strange, parallel dimension in which nothing is as it seems, and the rules of our reality have no bearing anymore. Enter the surreal and wonderfully twisted world of 'MirrorMask'.<br /><br />I was honestly blown away and awe struck by the imagery put forth in this adventure, and some moments simply had my jaw to the ground in disbelief. The mind is truly an amazing, underestimated thing, and perhaps never has it been more apparent than by the awesome imagination of Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean and the intensely talented folks with the Jim Henson company. The world relies on masks as the true source of identity or emotion, and quite literally everything is topsy turvy from the very ground to the buildings and sky. There is a major character named Valentine who becomes Helena's confidant in this mirrored world, and quickly shows her the ways of this strange and fascinating new universe of odd customs and equally perplexing inhabitants. One scene in the film was a bit funny in which Valentine wondered why Helena did not have a mask, and she answered that she didn't have one, then he asked her how else could she display emotions? That's just one of the ways in which this world operates, and it's a poignant commentary on how people in our society often unknowingly hide behind these masks that we put on in various social situations. This journey of Helena into a new dimension isn't just about exploring another destination, but it's most importantly a journey of self-exploration, of her own mind and how she eventually comes to terms with her mum falling ill and how she relates to her parents in the child-parent paradigm. Throughout the film she gets glances at herself through windows inside buildings, looking back at herself in the real world, and Helena in the real world staring back at herself in the parallel world of 'MirrorMask'. As we find out later on, the Helena in the real world isn't really herself, or is it? The question is answered by the end of the film, but the question still lingers, at least in the figurative sense. Withoutgiving too much away, Helena encounters numerous foes on the other side of reality, perhaps in a sense fighting the demons of her own artistic mind. Ultimately it's a coming of age story of how to deal with the transition from childhood to adulthood, and tackling the real life obstacles that far too often interfere with that metamorphosis, but also it's an important tale of the possibilities of not only our reality, but all the realities out there, the possible as well as the impossible ones, and the power and creativity of the human mind.<br /><br />'MirrorMask' is part surreal, visceral art exhibit on speed and hallucinogenics, and part drama depicting the trials and rewards of life. It's an emotional journey to be sure, with convincing, moving, passionate and deep performances by the cast, especially that of Helena who carries the film on her shoulders. The imagery in this tour de force will stick with one for a lifetime, and as the movie hints at, it really is the stuff dreams are made of. I found a bit of myself in this excellent film, and maybe some of you will too. Definitely a must see film, for so many reasons. Enter at your own risk though, because once you're in the world of 'MirrorMask', you might not want to leave.t giving too much away, Helena encounters numerous foes on the other side of reality, perhaps in a sense fighting the demons of her own artistic mind.

1568495110|5.0|I first read this book about 2 years ago, maybe 5 months after seeing the movie. And I can agree with everyone that the first pages were kind of a struggle, as the language is primarly taken from the Russian language and some altered english slang, and i think one or two german words. <br /> <br />But as i continued to read i got the hang of it. And upon finishing it, i felt that without a doubt it was better than the movie. As I find with all books that were made into movies. But the movie still is a classic in itself, and is one of my favourate films. <br /> <br />What I would primarly like to talk about here is the Nadsat language. I read the book more than 3 times over and realy, almost memorised the entire thing. I even went as far as buying the book in german and reading it. As I have been learning german. But about the language. <br /> <br />I recently had a forigen exchange student come to my school from Russia. I immedietly was interested in him, as i myself am going to be an exchange student to germany next year. After i became friends with him, i showed him A Clockwork Orange, and really he thought it was kind of silly, because the russian used in it, is inaccurate as far as to what it would really say. I shall give some examples: <br /> <br />Korova in russian means Cow <br />Viddy in russian means to like watch a movie or something to that extent, it doesn't precisly mean to 'see' or look, how it is sometimes used in the book. <br />Ptitsa in russian means bird.. so starry ptitsa, would mean old bird, which is accurate as old women are sometimes refered to as 'old birds' <br />Devotchka is the russian word for a woman, and depending on the way it is spelled and pronounced, it can mean young girl, or woman i believe. <br />Sharries in russian means testicles. and often people say that 'Kiss my sharries' means 'kiss my ass' <br />Spatchka in russian means hybernation, and is usually only refered to animals like bears that hybernate in the winter. In the book it refers to simply sleeping. <br /> <br />and there are more but those are some of the main ones that stick out in my mind. <br /> <br />Overall i think this book is among the greatest novels ever written. And will remain a classic.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I heard \\"Fight Test\\" while playing Project Gotham Racing on my Xbox.  This catchy tune was all I had to go by, and I started listening to this album.  I didn't like everything at first, but as I began to listen to these songs, it seems like this band has created a well-crafted album.  It is now a seasonal staple, for some reason, right before Christmas, and I am not sure why I like it then.  But, this album would definitely make it on my top 20 albums that I would take if I had to be stranded on an island for awhile.
B000007T1M|4.0|I first got into SOAD w/ \\"chop suey\\" and \\"Toxicity, having never have heard anything off the first album because it kind of went along with all the crap that came out (Limp Bizkit, Powerman 5000, etc.), I wanted to hear some of the early stuff.  After a couple of listens I quickly was captivated with the album as a whole, its definetly a work of art, dark art.  I have never really liked the lyrics in some of the songs though I have always been into the guitar aspect of SOAD , but Darons guitar matched with Serj's stranges vocals is something else.  Now when i listen to this album and toxicity ,it reminds me of a great era in my life and it will always be one of those albums I will never forget, whether good or bad,  <br /> <br />\\"Suite-Pee\\" is a song that will pull you in and make you want to head bang, it is probably one of the heaviest songs on the album, never liked the \\"Falling of the christ\\" pt. Just my opinion <br /> <br />\\"Know\\" this is one of the songs that i least listened to on the album, but the song is good <br /> <br />\\"Sugar\\" what can I say about sugar that nobody else has, it was a great song, maybe not so much single-worthy, but it was one of the reasons why I borrowed the album, only song i had heard bits and pieces of. (always kind of reminded me of what would be played at a nazi pep rally or something) <br />\\"suggestions\\" another least fav. but when I hear the Acoustic intro, it takes me back , just a real cool intro. <br /> <br />\\"Spiders\\" this soon became one of the reasons the albums stands out, this song is amazing, like the total opposite of \\"sugar\\" <br />I have always loved the SOAD kinda ballads and this was the first one <br /> <br />\\"Ddevil\\" One of my personal favorites on the album, guitar riffs in the verse are my favorite, Example of Serj showing of his weird personality <br /> <br />\\"Mind\\" i like this songs intro . its slow at first and then it gets in your face with a major riff <br /> <br />\\"Soil\\" the reason i like this song is theamazing solo in it, just shows us that Daron got some skillz in playing lead, great song <br /> <br />\\"War\\" the only thing about this song thats weird is when it breaks down, sounds like some kind of incantation, or occult ceremony.  But the song is heavy, and catchy <br /> <br />\\"Peephole\\" this song was first of the weird style they had going , like circus meets jewish barmitzvah thing. I totally was hooked on this song and style. Good solo too <br /> <br />\\"CUBErt\\" weird song on the album, I like it <br /> <br />\\"Dart\\" another personal fav., The riding bassline in the verse is awesome, but again not to fond of the lyrics at the end of the song <br /> <br />\\"PLUCK\\" everybody says this it the best song on the album, i disagree , its a good solid song but it just did not do to much for me  <br /> <br />So theres my review on this Great album, If your puzzled between THIS one or Toxicity , I prefer toxicity's style , but this is good too, Have not heard the new stuff yet. Steal this album is a great album, but nothing compared to these two.
0671578855|4.0|Actually, if you are a fan of the series, you have probably discovered and read this series. This book was mentioned to me by a fellow fan of Georgette Heyer (we were both under 30 at the time).     The problem I had when I picked this book up was that it is almost impenetrable for newcomers to the series, since its jokes and whole plotline is based on having read the earlier books (at least from BROTHERS IN ARMS, if not earlier). What you will need to have read to appreciate most of the jokes are the following books - BROTHERS IN ARMS (Miles Bk 3), MIRROR DANCE (Miles Bk 4), MEMORY (Bk 5) and KOMARR (Bk 6). [Miles becomes the protagonist from THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE, then in THE VOR GAME, then in CETAGANDA, then in BROTHERS IN ARMS, and so forth]. The first two books introduce Mark, Miles's cloned brother, and narrate how Miles met a fatal accident during a rescue operation. In the third book, Mirror Dance, Miles must cope with the consequences of that accident both medically and emotionally.  In the fourth book, Komarr, Miles takes up a government position as Lord Auditor on the second planet of the Barrayaran empire, Komarr. [His family has an interesting and strange history with that planet, referred to in earlier books and this one]. Here, he meets Ekaterin Vorsoissoin, the first woman of his caste and planet who has appealed to him.      In A CIVIL CONTRACT, for the first time, we see Miles attempting to court Ekaterin, now a widow, and doing it ineptly (to say the least). None of his previous successful courtship strategies work this time, partly because his previous lovers were military types.  To add to the plotline, there is his brother Mark's problems with his \\"in-laws\\" (the parents of *his* lover), his near-disastrous attempts to set up in business on Barrayar (creating food substitutes from insect products!), and his emotional distance from his family.  There is also the Emperor's forthcoming wedding; perhaps this is the couple featured on the cover inwhat appears to be the Mirror Dance. Most Bujold fans agree that the cover is truly dreadful (and was apparently designed to appeal to romance fans).  Lois had no choice in the cover, contrary to what some might think. [For more, see her website [...]    This is only part of the plotline, with at least four separate romances and one potential romance entertwined, plots against Miles (and two heirs to counts), the organization of the Imperial Wedding, and more.    To comment briefly on some criticisms by another reviewer: Most fans are aware of the similarities between Tsarist Russia (with the emperors, if not the Council of Counts) and Barrayar. It makes sense, given that most Barrayarans were descended from colonists of Russian stock. Furthermore, the word \\"Vor\\" used to name the Barrayaran aristocracy as well as a prefix for their surnames (e.g. Vorbarra for the imperial house, Vorkosigan for Miles's family) makes sense. The original counts were tax collectors, the original Vor were probably robber barons who became respectable. Vor means thief in Russian. Bujold might be commenting on the way in which kingship (and aristocracy) develops in societies all over the world.  For more on that, read serious histories on aristocracies and kingship (Reinhard Bendix has a good book).    Lois McMaster Bujold has written science fiction or fantasy.  The romantic element in most of her books is present but lightly sketched. A CIVIL CAMPAIGN (which is about Miles's courtship) is one exception, as is its sequel DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY (more about a conspiracy, than about Miles and Ekaterin).       I don't like everything about this book (although I have a good time snickering over that dinner party each time), or about Bujold's world-building. For one thing, Beta Colony is strangely underdeveloped. Barrayar is more developed (at least by this book, where there has been considerable devolution of power to the Counts, ala the experiment in the Russian Federation circa 1991). In earlier books, Cordelia seems strangely naive for a woman of 34 (but it can happen). She is also alarmingly outspoken for someone who rose to such a high position in the Betan Astronomical Survey. Here, we see a mature Cordelia, very sure of herself (unlike the Cordelia in SHARDS OF HONOR). Both she and Aral have grown into their characters.  Miles finally gets his comeuppance in this book, in that his romantic efforts as \\"General Romeo Vorkosigan\\" are thwarted by happenstance. It is nice to see Miles failing without fatal results (as in MIRROR DANCE) and becoming more like the rest of us.     The Vorkosigan series has been described as overblown, impossible, based on remarkable coincidences and worst-case scenarios.  Some of the books are more frenetically paced than others.  I notice that I tend to re-read the more slowly paced books such as MEMORY or the novella THE MOUNTAINS OF MOURNING more often. Sometimes I wish Bujold would have slowed down here and there in her earlier books.  But I do not regret having found her, nor having bought her books first in paper and now in e-books.    She is not everyone's cup of tea. She does not need to be. While fans of hardcore SF might feel she was an undeserved winner of Hugos and Nebulas, most people who read SF start out with fantasy or with classic SF such as Jules Verne. [No one complains that Verne's machines are impossible].  Hardcore SF has its fans (some of whom also like space opera and military SF).  Judging this book by its own merits (as part of a series, and the penultimate Miles book), it does quite well.    - Written by bookjunkiereviews 18 February 2006
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity, Toxicity... <br />Probably the greatest song in 2002.  To me nothing tops the first time hearing it, I was so puzzled at this band having only heard CHOP SUEY ( which took almost 5 months of listening to on raido and tv to start liking) It was so different from anything i have ever heard. It had everything from a sweet ass guitar intro-verse to a hardcore chorus.  Then my friend introduced me to the album and \\"Prison Song\\" which also was different but in a good way, I will never forget hearing Daron \\"I smack by bitch right here, in hollywood\\" it was almost comical in a way. Thats what pulled me in  a combination of Darons guitar-Daron and Serj Vocals-Comical aspect of the songs. Will always be one of my fav. albums. <br /> <br />Prison Song- Great song, my fav. is Darons stuff <br /> <br />Needles-Probably my second fav. song, agains Darons part  <br /> <br />Forest- I love this song to death, took a couple of listenings, the middle part is amazing <br /> <br />Jet Pilot and X- two least favorites, just did not do nothing for me and I dont mind at all, still the album is flawless <br /> <br />Chop Suey- song that started it all, took so long to decide that i actually enjoy it and its because of Daron and Serjs dueling vocals <br /> <br />Forest-Great song but not sure of the meaning <br /> <br />ATWA- love this song, I always like the SOAD ballads and this one quickly hit me like a ton of bricks <br /> <br />Shimmy and Science - these songs are the bomb, short but a great songs especially on the guitar <br /> <br />Bounce-song is Hilarious <br /> <br />Toxicity-my fav. of all songs, I was so obsessed with it. It was so perfectly arranged and is a short song. Video was awesome too <br /> <br />Phsycho- best thing about the song is the ending solo <br /> <br />aerials- very catchy song until radio played it out, but the first time i heard this song I could not get it out of my mind <br /> <br />GREAT album, Flawless, flawless, Pick it up if you have not heard it
B000BB1MIC|3.0|I was yet again impressed with the new season of Gilmore Girls. Rory and Lorelai were again up to their witty lives, but I thought it quite depressing when Lorelai started to date Luke. I'm sorry, but I didn't think that they were a good couple. It's too weird but that's what it is. Everything seemed too different to me, but maybe you will have a different perspective. I would give this season three stars.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Every scene is worth watching again and again.  At the same time, it is a comedy with a message.  Its serious point is as important as the absolutely hysterical moments.  It gets my highest rating.
0441172717|4.0|I can't help but think about the vast work J.R.R. Tolkien put into creating the world of LoTR when I read this book.  Like Tolkien, Herbert's world, or rather universes, come from a deeply considered and rich background history that is only suggested at in Dune.  Herbert doesn't fall into the trap of spending pages explaining how the Space Guild, Bene Geserit breeding program, and the empire itself affected what is going on in the book at hand.  He just leaves facts here and there for the reader to figure out, much as the primary character of Paul does.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't read the book until after the David Lynch movie, which apparently most people didn't understand but made perfect sense to me.  I read Dune: Messiah and then lost momentum halfway through children of Dune, where genetic memory gets so intertwined you need a scorecard and a psychologist on hand.  Having watched part of Sci-Fi Channels two Dune miniseries and the release of Lynch's uber-Dune inspired me to begin reading the series again.<br /><br />What can you say about a 14-year-old Duke's son who is potentially a christlike figure in two separate prophecies, particularly when the end means of both prophecies are polar opposites?  Unlike the various movies portraying Paul as an adult, the fact that he is a child when his father is killed by treachery arranged by not only their enemy house but by the emperor himself.<br /><br />Being taught the ways of his Bene Geserit mother, not to mention a Mentat (think of a human computer) training, basic warfare, and a new type of warfare his father and advisors were creating; Paul has a great deal of survival skills, enough to not only save himself but his pregnant mother.  He wins his way into the Fremen society with a fight to the death that he doesn't want to participate in.  In winning the fight, he inherits the dead man's wife, children, and water.  His mother earns her way in by becoming a reverend mother to the Fremen, at the cost of her daughter, Alia, being born premature and all knowing.<br /><br />And as I said, this is just when Paul, now Maub-dib, is 14, so you can imagine what sort of a man he becomes.  I'll stop here to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />I'd give this a 4 1/2 stars, simply because you really have to want to read the book at times.  The politics are rampant and therefore there are times you feel like you are watching an election year.  It's worth slugging through it, though, and despite yourself you will learn things rather than reading for escapism.  There are universal truths within it that can apply to any person at anytime.r daughter, Alia, being born premature and all knowing. <br /> <br />And as I said, this is just when Paul, now Maub-dib, is 14, so you can imagine what sort of a man he becomes.

B00005JO1Y|3.0|I think Peter Jackson either tried too hard or put too much love into it because at times I feel he is over doing it a bit.  I'm already suspending my belief in reality going into this but I believe at times he is asking too much of the audience.  For example, the brontosauruses spook by the raptors scene.  Adrian Brody and pals are dodging in out around the dinosaur's legs while avoiding being eating by raptors. This was fine for about a minute but this scene went on and on, to the point where I was laughing out loud, \\"this is ridiculous!\\".    I got to admit the Kong vs. the T-rex scene was good, but then again Mr. Jackson goes too far. Kong, the girl, and the t-rexes all fall and get stuck in vines and continued fighting, come on now...just end it already.  He kept throwing a large variety of CG animals at us,  bats, tetradactyls, spider things, giant leeches, more giant bug thing, dinosaurs... To me it was an overdose and I couldn't really wait to get off of Skull Island.   The ending just left me flat, at I didn't really care, emotionally\\" about the empire state building and Kong.  I was exhausted. (Maybe if they shone more people being splatted).  Jack Black - not bad, not great either  Adrian Brody - awful ( not his fault exactly, his character was pointless)  Naomi Watts wasn't bad but by the end she was just annoying.  King Kong was great, Mr. Jackson can be proud of that.  Overall it's worth viewing once, after that go back to the original from the 30's.
0679722610|5.0|This was my introduction to Hammett and I knew from reading the first page that I would read everything he'd ever written. Nobody mines the aspect of \\"tension and release\\" in narrative better, except maybe Raymond Chandler.  Two authors I'd give anything to ask 20 questions.  If you haven't read Red Harvest, I envy you the terrible joy of reading it for the first time.  Have at it, folks.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|This is easily Dylan's best release since 1974's BLOOD ON THE TRACKS. I've waiting a long time to hear this great musician back in top form, and here it is. True genius, it seems, neither dies nor does it fade away. An american poet of unequalled talent. All the wonderfully abstract, cryptic lyrics that have been missing for so long are back. Vocals dragged down a gravel road and soaked in the Mississippi mud. A masterpeice! If you enjoy this man's early works, but have kept your distance for the last few decades, it is time to move in for a fresh listen. I don't think you will be disappointed. Like the man says, \\"As great as you are man, you'll never be greater than yourself\\" <br />Thanks, and enjoy, <br />Tom
B000000HHE|4.0|This album holds up. Even though it's over ten years old at the time of this writing, it's still catchy and fun to listen to.
B000093BDX|4.0|A lot of the early car songs and surf songs - what I really wanted - are here, but several in mono. Many other real classics not included. OK for the price.
1592220053|5.0|Haviland Tuf is one of the most interesting charactors in science fiction. He's funny, enigmatic, surprising and compelling. George RR Martin's imagination and humor really drive this collection of short stories. It's one of the few books I find myself reading again and again.
6305080445|5.0|A very good comedy showing the Redford capacity to look silly, and to do it on purpose. he was wonderfully complemented by a subdued and understated Debra Winger who was warm and three diminsional, and often the straight man to the redford antics. We also discovered that darryl Hannah is not really very sexy, although that was her part. She was ouclassed even by the little girl. I highly recommend this movie as a great escape for a couple of hours. It is even possible to watch it twice.
B00005YXZH|5.0|<br />The entire band really pulls everything together on this album. They took some strange steps but all led to perfect results. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of the best albums, speaking in generalities, ever produced.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|Talented Rufus Wainwright in his third album proves that those people who experienced his music and his voice years ago for the first time were right to believe in him. A modern troubadour who has a lot to give in music. I recommend this cd it is a new dimension and without doubt something exceptional.
B000002LEU|4.0|i read a couple reviews before writting this and that is why I'm writting this. Nobody mentions the repetitiveness of a lot of these songs \\"autosuggestion\\" \\"shes lost control\\"... also a lot of these songs fail to capture any melody of some sort like \\"incubation\\" and \\"glass\\"... the songs that make these album worth the crappy songs is \\"warsaw\\" \\"digital\\" \\"transmission\\" \\"atmosphere\\" \\"love will tear us apart\\" and even though its repetetive \\"shes lost control\\"
0767817478|4.0|This film is not very original as for the monsters which are a cross between Spielberg's dinosaurs and Ridley Scott's aliens. The plot itself is very similar too and yet there are a lot of new elements that make the film interesting. First the cause that produced the monsters is plausible : the French nuclear tests in the South Pacific caused some « lizards » to mutate into giant and intelligent creatures. Then the main  place is New York. The film can thus allude to many other situations, King Kong of course, but also all those urban catastrophe films and the Ghostbusters, without forgetting Batman. This enables the director to show how trite and cowardly a New York mayor can be. Finally most of the action takes place in tunnels, underground and this is disquieting for many who are easily afraid by such situations. A little bit of sentimentalese mish mash, plus some French bravado about coffee and croissants, and you may even have a humoristic dimension. And you have to remember you must not trust a Frenchman even if he is an insurance salesman because all French people are somewhere secret agents working for their republic.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000035Z3K|1.0|I am so sorry a modern score HAD to be plastered onto this wonderful classic of the cinema.  The eeriness of the original is completely LOST.  Some of Bela Lugosi's first dialogues with his future assistant are \\"covered\\" and masked -- almost to the point of making the words unintelligible.  Words that MUST be spoken in silence!<br /><br />The musical style is just not appropriate.  This Glass score completely ruins the movie for me.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful essences of the mystery of the almost scoreless original is the bare silence of the scenes.<br /><br />Why must every darn single emotion be covered with music?  Glass has conceived of melodies that practically do not follow the feelings of each scene.  I really believe that Glass should stick to scoring movies with no dialogue...he does such a finer job when he doesn't intrude into the action and words.<br /><br />Also, I believe the acoustically modern qualities of the digital recording of this score sound too crisp, wet and alive for the necessary more muted sound qualities which this action requires.  It's as if Glass were trying to make something of a movie-cum-ballet out this classic.<br /><br />Glass should consider another Prince's recommendation for a musical score:<br /><br />Too Many Notes!<br /><br />(I am going to sell my copy.)

0399134204|5.0|Amy Tan's first novel is a masterpiece. I may have discovered this wonderful writer fifteen years late but now that I know she's out there I look forward with great anticipation to reading the rest of her books.<br /><br /> \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" takes us inside the lives of four Chinese mothers and their four American daughters. These eight unique women take turns telling the story through a series of sixteen vignettes covering the various stages of the mother-daughter relationships. The characters are fully realized and vividly portrayed. The events that shape their lives are at once alien and familiar.<br /><br /> It is the familiarity that is most endearing about this book. In an age when no one can seem to get along it's nice to see just how alike we all really are. No matter where you come from, no matter what religion, race, or nationality, if you read this book you will recognize something of yourself within its pages.<br /><br /> So go ahead. Take a look inside. Join the club.
0375501851|4.0|I started this book expecting to be totally disappointed, as I was with another black author au jour (Jones--Known World), figuring all the hoopla was out of political correctness. The book mesmerized me from page one. It's hilarious, incredibly well written.  Even though satire is not my favorite genre, I thoroughly enjoyed it and remain in awe of the power of this writer.  I would have given it a 5 but it dragged a little at times, and I found myself counting pages to the end.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What a concept.  Exploring space with a group of people looking for new frontiers and with some good old capitalistic savvy.  I first watched this with no idea who these actors were, with the exception of Adam Baldwin, and grew to love and appreciate each one's role <br />in this western in space.  Great adventure, wonderful dialogue and <br />a interesting concept of the universe.  It's definitely one of a kind.  Mr. Whedon, more please.
0066620996|5.0|In Collins search for what makes a company great, he develops some solid criteria and gives the reader several relevant examples.  However, unfortunately any research in this area is somewhat objective.  It is difficult to scientifically quantify many of the qualities that Collins looks for in his 'great' companies.  More discussion on the application of these traits to non-corporate organizations would also be a solid addition to the material presented.  However it's still an interesting read, even if you're not a CEO.  Don't get me wrong though, some interest in business is required.
B0000E2FLC|4.0|I couldn't help but notice how great this DVD is, but... all of the songs sound way too much like the studio recordings. <br /> <br />That is to say, the reason why I buy concert DVDs is to here a version of the song that different from the album version and to watch the band. In this one, you just get to watch the band. There's nothing different sounding.  <br /> <br />That's why I like, say, the Led Zeppelin DVD more than this one.  <br /> <br />I would've given this 3 stars, but Angus Young's hilarious strip-tease gave it another.
B000E0OBK6|5.0|Jarhead is a movie about the war in Saudi Arabia. It foccuses more on the soldiers that are in the war then the war itself. The dialogue is a bit \\"eehh\\", although the acting is flawless and the overall of the movie is spectacular. I do belive director Sam Mendes has another masterpiece in his hands.
0894803123|3.0|Oh boy, hind site is 20/20!  I should have read the reviews BEFORE I bought the book.  Nice ideas, as far as the stir in's -a nice varity of flavors.  BUT they call for RAW eggs, I can't do it.  My Mom is fighting cancer for the 3rd time and to risk  the introduction of raw eggs into her diet could be a death sentence. There are other people in our lives who too must avoid bacteria, we all should.  This book really needs to be pulled off the market, or revamped with a new base recipe!  I kid you not.  Such a shame for this book
B00006JJ51|5.0|Simply the best rap CD of all time.  Interesting, though, that Dr. Dre doesn't \\"smoke weed or sess\\" in \\"Express Yourself\\" and then moved on to the \\"Chronic.\\"
B000AARKOO|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie, although the cuts to make the movie fit into a 2-hour time frame were shameful. The first time I saw it, I definitely felt something was missing. I cannot wait to view the director's cut of this movie, and fill in those missing pieces. I thought the acting, expecially Orlanda Bloom's, was second to none. Beautiful acting, beautiful movie... Don't be fooled by the box office \\"failure\\" - if you think you MIGHT like the movie, you absolutely should watch it.
B0006Z2KIY|4.0|500 previous reviews have said it all, but some observations on a movie that has some twists and turns and more depth than one might first imagine in a blatant tear-jerker:   <br /> <br />clasic stereotypical rich girl wants poor boy plot works in this semi-period piece; enough old cars, military uniforms and swing music to evoke world war II era.  pre-integration south is not portrayed as retarded or evil. <br /> <br />allie's dad was a disconcerting combination of leon redbone and leroy nieman or maybe rollie fingers with that mustache of his; comedic effect detracted from taking his character (long-suffering daddy to little girl...) seriously, but he was most sketchy major character anyway. <br /> <br />allie's mom was lee-remickish and alluring for a semi-old broad and, consistent with complexity of situation, not the witch in the end you thought she was in the beginning.  goes to show everybody's got a secret of their own... <br /> <br />aging of noah was somewhat unbelievable; ryan gosling is evidently too youthful to look older without a beard and long hair, but it was out of place in the late 40s and early 50's south.  and his character starts out like a young robert deniro and ends up like a middle-aged jeff daniels. <br /> <br />allie showed gymnast's agility in the way she kept jumping up on noah and wrapping her legs around him, even on public streets; while that was great to fantasize about, it was again, disconcerting.  as was her penchant for continually slapping and hitting him when she got mad.   that would have caused me to wonder about the future with a woman like that, notwithstanding her obvious upside... <br /> <br />thought movie showed some depth by not protraying rich, handsome other-guy lon as bad, possessive or abusive but instead as a decent guy.  life is that way, there can be two good guys, hence a girl's dilemma of which to chose. <br /> <br />thought gena rowlands did excellent job of portraying the fear in an old person who knows they are losing it but can't help it.  and james garner did excellent job of protraying the helpless spouse who can only do what he can and watch his loved one's inexorable deterioration.  never saw him cry real tears before; it was heart-wrenching.   <br /> <br />wish there were more acting jobs for old pros; maybe there will be as boomers age and want to watch themselves on the screen. <br /> <br />movie makes it no surprise that noah and allie in the story that takes place in the 40's are the older couple in the present; best plot twist of all, i thought, which is low-keyed, is who wrote the notebook...  it ain't who you think, but it drives home the ultimate message of the movie. <br /> <br />definitely recommend renting this flick; bring the popcorn and kleenex...
B000669GAI|5.0|This is a greatest hits albumn of the greatest American Band ever.....so how could it be bad. Pearl Jam is one of the top 10 greatest bands ever and it took this long for them to get a greatest hits cd?.....that kinda sucks but this albumn does not....it is great...you finally get a studio version of I got Id, which to me is easily one of their best songs....
B000CBSHK2|5.0|Only February and we already have one of the top recordings of the year.  Trip-hop, shmip-hop, if you need to file music under one of your categories, your brain has already been sanitized.  This is excellent stuff.  Uncategorizable, but one will definitely hear strains of all of the influences Orton attributes in interviews.  The analog recording was a brilliant choice: the aural definition and clarity serves Orton's material perfectly.  This CD is smart, spanning a broad emotional range, with beautiful songs in a variety of tempos.  Highly recommended!
B00006M183|5.0|Its Pearl Jam....they are the greatest American band in history...this cd is awesome...they are still awesome after all these years...
B0000028M7|5.0|No grunge - no angst - simply the finest hard rock album ever made. By anyone. Buy it.
B0002UOK04|5.0|I was recomended this album/band from a friend, who said that I should definetly pick it up if I could find it. It is impossibly hard to find records from \\"obscure\\" metal bands where I live, also known as 85% of bands from outside North america. So one day while I was shuffiling through the Metal CDs at my local Record store, to my utter surprise, I found this. since I had a pocket full of recently made cash I felt I had to buy something, so not finding anything else that I was interested in, I grabbed this one. I had not heard any songs from the record, and I hadn't listened to Ensiferum or Norther, although I did hear good things. To say the least I was completely floored by just how good this album is! Wintersun is in no way a rip-off of Ensiferum, or any other band for that matter. Jari Maenpaa has made a very unique melodic death/power/folk metal blend here. to go off the topic of music for a second, I also really liked the artwork on the cover and in the booklet, it has a very cool frost-like effect on the pages where the lyrics are. At first Listen Wintersun seems to be a CoB/Kalmah/Norther rip off, but about half way through the Record you will realise that Wintersun is so much more then the aforementioned bands. So If your a fan of the melodic death metal scene, you have to listen to this. It breathes life into a genre that is getting more then a wee bit stale.<br /><br />If you managed to read this entire review, and didn't feel like kicking me in the teeth after doing so, or found it remotely interesting, appealing, or helpful please take a second out of your busy day to press the \\"yes\\" button next to \\"Was this review helpful to you?\\"<br />Thank you,<br />-Igar the Terrible
B000957O82|4.0|Perfect story for Will Smith's first romantic comedy!! He plays the 'date doctor'...a guy hired by men to give invaluable lessons about how to date the dream girl. The character played by Kevin James was hilarious, and very cute, at first. He did a great job really! The movie really is highly recommended because you'll find yourself easily smiling throughout the whole of it. It lifts your spirits (if in a bad mood) and by the time the movie ends you'll forget anything that was bothering you!! Just as is mentioned by the other reviewers...it's a perfect movie to watch on a date!! My favourite bit of the story is in spite of being the expert on dating tactics his own love life becomes a comic mess. And so the ending..when Will Smith gets together with Eva Mendes is especially touching.<br /><br />If you're looking for something romantic funny and sweet don't miss this one!
B000002H33|5.0|This is definitely the best Metallica album.It's the perfect album for someone who wants to get into Metallica.Every song in it is just unique.James and Kirk are playing some of the strongest and coolest guitar riffs and solos i have ever heard.Of course,Lars and the Great Cliff are equally perfect.And the production of the album is really awesome for it's time.A really must have album for every true metal fan.A masterpiece!!!!
0393061310|5.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is a monumental work that manages to encapsulate an explanation for why human history is the way it is within 500 pages. If you are interested in why the world's societies are they way they are today or want to understand the chain of events that led to where we are today, then you owe it to yourself to read Guns, Germs and Steel.<br /><br />Many centers of learning are currently engrossed in teaching new generations self-loathing based on some of the genoicidal atrocities committed by past generations. While I think it is important to learn from the past, there are positive as well as negative lessons buried there. This book deals with many of the cataclysmic events in human history where societies exterminated one another through various means. It certainly makes clear that history has been peppered with ruthless people willing to wipe out entire cultures in order to dominate. But Guns, Germs and Steel looks much deeper than that. Reading this book will make it clear that the firecely competitive cultures which embraced new technologies are the ones that now dominate and flourish.<br /><br />Guns, Germs and Steel is not going to be palatable to everyone, as it contains wordy explanations of why farmers triumphed over hunter gatherers. It often bored me somewhat with lists of various grains, food types, domesticated livestock and so on. However, the serious student of human history will read carefully because the content offered, including the lists, is the most coherent explanation of the who, what, where, when and why in relation to the modern world that I have read.<br /><br />Most interesting to me were the strongly presented comments by author Jared Diamond that related to systems of governance:<br /><br />  \\"In fact, precisely because Europe was fragmented, Columbus succeeded on his fifth try in persauding one of Europe's hundreds of princes to sponsor him. Once Spain had thus launched the European colonization of America, other European states saw the wealth flowing into Spain, and six more joined in colonizing America. The story was the same with Europe's cannon, electric lightning, printing, small firearms, and innumerable other innovations: each was at first neglected or opposed in some parts of Europe for idiosyncratic reasons, but once adopted in one area, it eventually spread to the rest of Europe.<br /><br />  These consequences of Europe's disunity stand in sharp contrast to those of China's unity. From time to time the Chinese court decided to halt other activities besides overseas navigation: it abandoned development of an elaborate water-driven spinning machine, stepped back from the verge of an industrial revolution in the 14th century, demolished or virtually abolished mechanical clocks after leading the world in clock construction, and retreated from mechanical devices and technology in general after the late 15th century. Those potentially harmful effects of unity have flared up again in modern China, notably during the madness of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, when a decision by one or a few leaders closed the whole country's school system for five years.\\"<br /><br />Humans have an innate need to manage one another, but Guns, Germs and Steel touches on which types of management lead to societies which prosper.<br /><br />  \\"It remains a challenge for historians to reconcile these different approches by answering the question: \\"Why Europe and not China?\\" The answer may have important consequences for how best to govern China and Europe today. For example, from Lang's and my perspective, the disaster of China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when a few misguided leaders were able to close the school system for five years, may not be a unique one-time-only aberration, but may presage more such disasters in the future unless China can introduce far more decentralization into its political system. Conversely, Europe, in its rush toward political and economic unity today, will have to devote much thought to how to avoid dismantling the underlying reason behind its successes of the last five centuries.\\"<br /><br />Are you listening America? Keyphrase: decentralization of political power leads to successful, vibrant and dominant societies with the best technology and superior militaries. And there's more:<br /><br />  \\"All of this suggests that we may be able to extract a general principle about group organization. If your goal is innovation and competitive ability, you don't want either excessive unity or excessive fragmentation. Instead, you want your country, industry, industrial belt, or company to be broken up into groups that compete with one another while maintaining relatively free communication-like the U.S. federal government system, with its built-in competition between our 50 states.\\"<br /><br />Reading Guns, Germs and Steel reinforced my own preconceived notion that our federal government's growth since the Civil War hashad a largely negative impact, slowing growth and innovation as the individual states themselves become less and less autonomous. As Congress has perverted the Constitution and robbed powers they are expressly forbidden from the sovereign states, the country appears more and more homogenous.<br /><br />Jared Diamond concludes that finding the right balance between indepedence and unity, couple with totally open communication is what gaurantees successful societies. If his conclusions are correct then I think we're probably slipping away from the right balance for a successful society in the United States, here in 2006.<br /><br />But go read the book for yourself. You may draw different conclusions than I did. You will certainly learn some things you didn't know and see others from a new vantage point.political and economic unity today, will have to devote much thought to how to avoid dismantling the underlying reason behind its successes of the last five centuries.\\" <br /> <br />Are you listening America?

B000002AVF|5.0|After listening to a decade of Mariah Carey, witnessing her successes and elevation among music greats, I must say that Mariah Carey has put out some phenomenal albums over the years. However, in my opinion \\"Daydream\\"'s musical quality eclipses that of her previous efforts, and is her greatest album. Filled with breathless ballads, up-tempo R&B and that phenomenal voice makes this album an absolute classic.  <br />The first single from this album \\"Fantasy\\", a catchy, upbeat number  that is fun to listen to. \\"One Sweet Day\\" is one of the best Mariah songs ever. The song is oh so powerful, so meaningful and sounds great. \\"Always be my baby\\" is a funky, very catchy and is a fan's favourite. \\"Forever\\" has an olden day charm and Mariah sounds absolutely gorgeous singing this song, and is probably my favourite song on this album. The cover \\"Open Arms\\" is fantastic with Mariah's silky, soulful voice and upstages its humble original.  <br />Daydream is a truly phenomenal album and deserves it place among the classics.
B000002LPD|3.0|Although it has some decent tracks (Runaround, Top of the World) and some pretty darn good ones (Poundcake, Right Now, 316) For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge marked the first time that there really wasn't much to get excited about in a new Van Halen album. By the time of the record's release in mid-1991 cracks were already starting to show in the foundation of a music industry dominated by superficial hair metal bands. It wouldn't be long before Nirvana would abruptly shatter popular music into a thousand pieces, taking rock in a new direction where Van Halen would be unable to follow. Despite the changes that were rapidly approaching, Van Halen did enjoy one last summer of glory here before it all came crashing down. Knowledge isn't an album that has aged particularly well, and one gets a sense that the group had run out of inspiration at this point in its career. Despite this, Eddie's guitar work is in fine form as always and the musicianship certainly makes this one worth checking out for fans of 80s guitar rock.
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey's third album \\"Music box\\" is a masterpiece, one of the best albums by a female artist. Music box combines beautiful and meaningful lyrics with Mariah's powerhouse vocals, helping transcend this album into an absolute classic.  <br />Favourite songs in this album include the upbeat and fun \\"Dreamlover\\", the inspiring and powerful \\"Hero\\", \\"Never forget you\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"All i ever wanted\\" which closes the album nicely. \\"Without you\\" is also one of the best covers period. Mariah breathlessly and effortlessly shifts between sombre lows and towering highs, and fills this song with an aching sadness and longing.  <br />Mariah Carey, blessed with the voice of an angel, manages to combine her singing talent with some wonderful written songs, making this album an absolute delight to listen to.
B00005ATZT|5.0|The Fugitive is just one of those movies you find yourself watching over and over again. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, a vasculor surgeon wrongfully sent to prison for the murder of his wife. Upon his escape, one of the best scenes of the entire movie, the good Dr. sets out to find the one armed man responsible for his wife's death. Enter Tommy Lee Jones as United States Deputy Marshall Samuel Gerard, a bloodhound of a man who doesn't quit until he gets his man, and the chase is on... Enjoy!
B000002BQK|5.0|After releasing the masterpiece \\"Daydream\\", one must question whether Mariah will have the lasting power, to continue to keep the towering standard she had set. Yet she effortlessly does it in \\"Butterfly\\". Despite deviating from the ballad rich albums of the past and veering towards a more R&B/Hip-Hop style, Mariah shows she can still mix it with the best of either genre.  <br />Standouts on this album include: \\"Butterfly\\", a truly beautiful ballad with amazing heartfelt lyrics. \\"My all\\" showcases Mariah's powerhouse vocals and is a slower, tender ballad. \\"The Roof\\" is a classic Mariah R&B song with a nice beat and good lyrics. \\"Outside\\" is a brilliant ballad, with personal lyrics and sung with utmost emotion, one of the best songs here.  <br />Mariah Carey's Butterfly signals Mariah's transition from pop sensation to R&B diva, and it is just fantastic.
630512065X|5.0|I first saw CATS when I was in second grade. Mom bought the video and showed it to me, 'cause I'd seen a thing about CATS and OLD OPOSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATS on PBS Kids. So I watched the video. At first, I have to admit, it kind of scared me. Macvity really looks cool to me now--but when I was seven, he was just scary. So that's a little problem. If you have kids who want to watch this, I suggest that unless they know what they're going to see, you might want to fast-forward through the Macavity sequence. <br /> <br />Mistofflees is my favorite character. The first time I saw it, I was too busy hiding my face in the couch pillows (because of Macavity) to notice Jacob Brent's spectacular dance moves, but after the 500th time watching it, I got used to Macavity and started paying attention to the details, like the goofs, the trivia, and...the most important thing: the dancers. <br /> <br />One word for the dancers: wow. I mean, these people have to dace, sing, AND do their own makeup. I'm not kidding! I don't know if they had to do it for the movie (if they did, I feel sorry for the people who playeed Macavity and Munkustrap), but I know they have to do it for the musical.  <br /> <br />The \\"Mungojerrie & Rumpleteazer\\" dance is definitely the most fun to watch...and how do these people do it? There's one part where the girl takes hold of the guy's waist and they do this cartwheel-thing...HOLDING ON TO EACH OTHER! How the heck did they learn THAT? And in the musical, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer have to do the exact same thing, without benefit of extra takes or a backing vocal track. Now, note that some singers (Vitamin C, Christina Milian, for example) need vocal tracks when they don't dance very much, but when the CATS cast does it live, THEY DON'T LIP-SYNCH AT ALL! How do they do it? I know I couldn't. Heck, I can't even do a cartwheel on my own, much less with someone holding on to my waist, and singing on top of that! Anyway, Jo Gibb is the perfect Rumpleteazer. If you need proof of that, just look at ANY of her closeups during the film. <br /> <br />The Rumpuscat sequence really makes me laugh. You can see during this that Munkustrap really wants Old Deuteronomy to like it, and the Rumpuscat's really starting to get on his nerves...I love it! Watch for Mistofflees and Skimbleshanks, they come out wearing oversized sneakers on their heads pretending to be dogs, and Munkustrap rolls his eyes at them (believe me, it's not the first time). <br /> <br />Skimbleshanks...what can I say about Skimbleshanks? Oh, I can definitely say that this was the first CATS song that I memorized all the lyrics to! My favorite verse is the third:  <br /> <br />\\"At 11:42 <br />With the signal overdue <br />All the passengers are frantic <br />To a man <br />That's when I would appear <br />And I'd saunter to the rear <br />I've been busy in the luggage van\\" <br /> <br />Skimbleshanks is known as \\"The Railway Cat\\". I just love it that the cats have actual professions, like Shimbleshanks, or Gus: The Theatre Cat. <br /> <br />As for goofs, I only saw one: during the part where Mistofflees turns Cassandra into Old Deuteronomy, then brings her back, the lump under the blanket is twicw the size of the girl playing Cassandra. <br /> <br />Speaking of Mistofflees, when I first saw the video, I didn't really notice much about any of the cats, I just looked at whatever was in the middle of the screen (give me a break, I was only seven!). After watching it 2,000 times (and two of those 2,000 times were seen live), I can now tell you all kinds of stuff about Mistofflees. For example, anybody watch and think, \\"Oh, Mistofflees loves Cassandra, he used her for one of his magic tricks\\"? No. Not a chance. See, he really loves Victoria, but he didn't pick her because he didn't want anything to happen to her! Just watch the video. Those two are together in the background a LOT. <br /> <br />Okay, see, THIS is what happens when you watch a movie/TV show/musical 2,000 times. You start thinking about the love lives of two fictional alley cats. Weird, huh? <br /> <br />Overall: I LOVE THIS VIDEO!
B000268QB2|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  I first heard them on Grey's Anatomy and wondered who they were.  Their sound was so unique, clear and clean.  They should have won this years Grammy for Best New Artist.  We will be hearing more from this guys, mark my words.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i know that some people are green and their name is day but that doesn't mean that u go and eat a smelly marker because it smells good and then u poop out weird color but it smells good and u die shortly after that from slipping on a wet spot on the floor where your dog peed and then fall into a bottle of water and suffacate.Now i hope that hasn't happened to u yet because if it has you are obviously a walrus that has a small head.Have u ever seen a green day before because i know that i havn't.i mean i've seen green lobsters before but not a green day.just remember the dog doesn't eat its pencil before the hamster roars on a elephant that mistakes the hamster for a mouse and runs away until it slips a blade of grass so it falls and creates a earthquake and makes your uncle choke on a peice of sushi and chokes to death like my uncle.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The soundtrack takes you right back to the film.  Heartwrenching and sad.  This should get the Oscar for the best soundtrack of a film as it adds so much to the entire film.  Purchase this now.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Excellent.I was pleasantly surprised by the lesser known songs of the second disc, which were all wonderful!
B0002KVULG|5.0|I saw this when it was made, and just have to agree with Angel (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) that Frank Langella best captured Dracula's essence (I love that this conversation came up on an episode of Buffy). His sensuality, his magnetism, his physical beauty, all come together to create the character of Dracula so convincingly that it becomes quite believable that vampires really do exist. While the stylized, philosophical and breathtakingly filmed versions of the legend, \\"Nosferatu\\" both Murnau's and Herzog's, are compelling and gorgeous films, they don't attempt to convince us of the real existence of vampires. Somehow this film, through Frank Langella's performance coupled with that of the lovely and intelligent Kate Nelligan, make this quite a believable tale. Bram Stoker would be thrilled to see his creation come so vividly and enthrallingly to life.<br /><br />My advice is to sit back, watch, and take Angel's recommendation seriously--clearly, at least two vampires we know of, Angel and Langella's Dracula, really do exist. Watching them is great fun, especially for we women on those days when we just long for someone gorgeous to look at us with eyes burning with passion--someone who will sweep us up into strong arms, and take us away to places Calgon can't even remotely get us to (*sigh*)!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I expected more guite solos and more rock-music rather than quiet country style. Knofler should have stayed with Dire Strait
B00005JLWN|3.0|Straight to the point: the comparisons of EQUILIBRIUM to THE MATRIX are not only borderline absurd; they ironically serve to reveal the inherent structural weaknesses of this movie.<br /><br />To begin with I don't know if EQUILIBRIUM actually made it to the theaters. I saw it on video a while back, with its packaging complete with critic blurbs on the cover saying \\"It's like the MATRIX, only cooler,\\" or something equally stupid. As this sci-fi Dystopia came out during the height of THE MATRIX trilogy's appeal, that conversation was an effective marketing tool, not a spontaneous one from the public. More importantly however, of the two plots, THE MATRIX is more believable--thereby more compelling--for a specific reason.<br /><br />THE MATRIX essentially follows the FRANKENSTEIN tradition from 19th century literature of Man screwing around with his own nature without having any real understanding of it, and unleashing hell in the process. With so many books and movies doing brilliant and socially relevant variations on this theme through the generations, for the Wachowski brothers to work within its application to the Information Society like so many before them takes a pair of unique minds. Especially since Arnold's THE TERMINATOR series basically does their plot brilliantly long before they did. (Not to mention SOILENT GREEN's application of the parable to population growth and consumption; PLANET OF THE APES with the parable as a civil rights metaphor; and the MAD MAX trilogy's application of it to the oil industry.) But that also meant, however, they had a great deal of help in making it plausible with all those models. The brothers Wachowski took the help and ran with it, making history in the process.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM fails where THE MATRIX succeeds for me on this point: a post-world war/holocaust Dystopia that survives on the suppression of anything central to human nature must still, as the movie shows, be built on some bureaucratic structure that supports a neo-capitalist, neo-feudal, pyramid/caste system--a system the movie hints at via the cleric-police but does not truly show. Referring again to its literary antecedents: Orwell's most popular books--1984 and ANIMAL FARM-essentially focus on the moral failure of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As such, in this post-Soviet Union communism world, it is hard for people to not believe our own press regarding the purity and unmitigated glories of our current system, having \\"won\\" the Cold War. But Orwell was equally if not more so concerned with the evil of pure capitalism and imperialism. Particularly capitalism's ability, when left unchecked and unfettered within an imperialist system, to, as the political philosopher Michael Lind says in his book UP FROM CONSERVATISM, \\"completely replicate, down to precise details of organization and detail, the communism that it opposes.\\" The writings of Orwell addressing this were censored-that's right, censored-by the English press when he wrote them before and after World War II and are the stuff of dissident literature footnotes and trivia now. As such they are even more important to address today, given that our world has been economically redefined (sort of) from Globalization, a \\"new\\" animal we have yet to truly understand. There in fact has been an open debate amongst literary types for decades now as to whether Orwell's socialist/communist Dystopia that is 1984 is a more accurate prediction of the future than Aldous Huxley's techno-capitalist Dystopia that is BRAVE NEW WORLD. Most people, after even the most cursory look at Globalization and its discontents today, will tell you, via Huxley focusing on the irresistible force of pure capitalism meeting the immovable object of unquestioning scientific innovation (and human freedom becoming the thing that's got to give when that happens [and does]), that he beat Orwell by a mile.<br /><br />How is this relevant? Simple: the fundamental plotline of EQUILIBRIUM is thejourney of a party-faithful man who, almost accidentally, reclaims his humanity in a dehumanizing world to such a degree that he becomes the force capable of initiating a truly human revolution. The dehumanizing world is one where the primary philosophy of existence is simple: human emotion is the cause of all suffering through its eventual inspiration to war. Therefore it must be suppressed and exorcised from the human experience for a healthy community and a stable body politic. This is accomplished through the manufacture, dissemination and institutionalization of state-sanctioned drugs (designed to suppress all emotion), and the institutionalized incineration of all things from the old pre-War culture that inspire emotions to surface, i.e. art, literature, passionate love, pets, etc. None of this could be possible without the systems and structures of the drug's manufacture and dissemination to each and every household. Therefore, *the state-subsidized monopoly that is the drug industry* is what is actually running this Dystopia, not its stated philosophy--which the very designers of the drug and the system supporting it could easily prove to be scientifically bogus. That is the true message. EQUILIBRIUM is a cautionary tale about CAPITALISM gone mad, not any experiments in communism or socialism or neo-Puritanism, like what it implies. It is Capitalism-as-Frankenstein: the blindly arrogant belief that \\"the market\\" could not enslave its creators...leading to exactly that. The writers, seemingly to avoid pissing off the would-be corporate distributors of this film, fail to make this abundantly clear.<br /><br />Where THE MATRIX never loses its structural grounding in its \\"scientific-innovation-via-artificial-intelligence-as-Frankenstein\\" cautionary tale, the writer(s) of EQUILIBRIUM never fully establish theirs. And it is this sense of \\"let me tell you a cautionary tale without telling you in actuality what you really need to be cautious of\\" that makes the movie not nearly as good as THE MATRIX or its classic Dystopia predecessors with a clear cut, courageous-and relevant-message.<br /><br />Christian Bale, the star, is still, however, one of my favorite actors. Sean Bean and Taye Diggs are great.  I expected good performances in EQUILIBRIUM (and some silly special effects) and wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't buy this movie, but I would recommend you seeing it.BRIUM is the journey of a party-faithful man who, almost accidentally, reclaims his humanity in a dehumanizing world to such a degree that he becomes the force capable of initiating a truly human revolution.

The writers, seemingly to avoid pissing off the would-be corporate distributors of this film, fail to make this abundantly clear.  <br /> <br />Where THE MATRIX never loses its structural grounding in its \\"scientific-innovation-via-artificial-intelligence-as-Frankenstein\\" cautionary tale, the writer(s) of EQUILIBRIUM never fully establish theirs. And it is this sense of \\"let me tell you a cautionary tale without telling you in actuality what you really need to be cautious of\\" thatmakes the movie not nearly as good as THE MATRIX or its classic Dystopia predecessors with a clear cut, courageous-and relevant-message.  <br /> <br />Christian Bale, the star, is still, however, one of my favorite actors. Sean Bean and Taye Diggs are great.  I expected good performances in EQUILIBRIUM (and some silly special effects) and wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't buy this movie, but I would recommend you seeing it.  <br /> <br />

0895260131|4.0|This is a well-executed book, with facts and citations. This is a controversial subject that is well treated with thoughtfulness and seriousness. In so doing, he does the service of stripping away a lot of the veneer of political correctness that surrounds the current struggle. <br /> <br />As to those who say that this is a one-sided argument, I would say that the other side of the argument has had plenty of places to make its case. This book is not a balanced account, nor should it be.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I was surprised to find all the reviews saying how Amnesiac was expermental and how it didn't sound like Radiohead. I loved it. I think it's just as good as Ok Computer, The Bends, and Kid A. All of Radiohead's albums are great in my opinion(even Pablo Honey! Really!). It's really electronic which you would don't hear in Radiohead songs, but I still don't understand why someone coulodn't easily recognize this as a good Radiohead record.<br /><br /> My personal favorite is Pulk Pull Revolving Doors. A very interesting electronic song. Not something you'd hear in any other Radiohead song, but I think that's what makes this album so good. It was the last thing you'd expect Radiohead to do!<br /><br /> Don't overlook Amnesiac; it's Radiohead's most fascinating work. And if you don't lie it right away, give it a chance! You may find that you love it just as much as their other albums. Radiohead is, by far, the best band of our generation.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is by far one of, if not the most, creepiest movies I've ever seen. I had to watch it for AP Film but absolutely loved it...definitely weird but beautifully shot. The script is ingenius, and Swanson plays her part like no other.
0060989157|4.0|\\"Shout at the Devil\\" was one of those seminal LPs back when I was in 8th grade.  Along with Dokken, Van Halen, Ratt and Def Leppard, Motley Crue defined '80s hard rock. <br /> <br />What makes this such an enjoyable read is that it's told from the first person perspective of both the band members and those who had business dealings with them.  Sometimes it's hard to feel sorry for multi-millionaire rock stars when they moan about lack of funds for their $12K-a-month drug habits and $40K monthly nut for cars and McMansions in Simi Valley and Westlake Village, but what it does illustrate is that financial security is relative:  no matter how much you pull down, it's very easy to live beyond one's means. Some will think they're nothing but a bunch of whining rockers who don't know what real problems are.  But Tommy Lee's incarceration was very interesting to read about and very real and visceral. <br /> <br />I'm giving this four stars because it ends abruptly -- hopefull an updated edition with an expanded ending will be released soon.  I'm curious how Mick Mars is getting on with his rare disease.  Great read.
0977326403|5.0|The monograph offers a simplistic insight into why not-for-profits are run differently than for profit enterprises. It is a must read for business persons who are invited to serve on not-for-profit boards. Jim Collins gives the business person a place to go to understand how the characteristics of effectively managed businesses finds it's place with the philosophical purposes of the not-for-profit. I will add this work to my recommended reading list and will continue to share it with my clients in positions of leadership in the not-for-profit sector with a recommendation they gift a copy  to all new board mebers.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Billed as a hard-boiled contemporary noir--not an homage, but the real deal--Miller's story gives us stuff in the vein of cannibals, ninjas, and hookers.  As authentic to the genre as putting dragons and wizards in an espionage film.  The characters have false voices, as well--Miller actually has an eleven year old schoolgirl talking with such a clipped, bad-ass cool, it makes Fred MacMurray sound like Wally Cox.  He also seems to enjoy portraying castrations of many types, such as gunshots to the groin, knifings, and so on.  A fun time for all.  A brilliant work, if only it was written by a highschool prodigy, but for a major Hollywood work, it only serves to reinforce the stereotype that it takes little to impress fanboys.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|What a wonderful experience for the mind and body. Buy it! It is superb.
0553573403|5.0|I had expected more magic, but that doesn't matter anymore. The twists and mysteries more than make up for it. With each chapter revolving around a different character in the plot, George R.R. Martin isn't afraid to hurt them, physically or emotionally. Which is another reason why i highly recommend this book, the thing you will least expect will happen. However, if you love the classical fantasy where the central hero(s) never gets hurt then don't read this book but if you do like twists and turns, i highly recommend this for the casual or avid fantasy reader.

B00080ZG10|5.0|This film has it all: inventive cinematography, glamour, thrilling action scenes, and a heartbreaking story.    The focus is on two aspects that greatly affected the brilliant Howard Hughes' life: his love of airplanes, and his struggles with the (then-unknown and untreatable) chemical imbalance Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. No other movie I've seen shows the horror that OCD can be (usually they just try to make it 'cute'), and the OCD scenes are incredible. Ditto for those amazing airplane scenes.     Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job channelling Kate Hepburn. But it is DiCaprio who stuns in the role that won him the Golden Globe for Best Actor; he gives a beautiful, knockout performance.    Add to this a great period music score and the deft, imaginative direction of the brilliant Martin Scorsese, and you have a picture that deserved every award it won, and more!

B000BP86OG|5.0|I admit it, I'm stuck in the 80's; hair bands rule my world.  I haven't been happy about a band since the coming of Stone Temple Pilots.  When I initially heard \\"One Way Ticket to Hell\\", something told me I had to get this CD.  The first 4 songs are fabulous (One Way Ticket, Knockers, Is It Just Me?, Dinner Lady Arms), and I just can't get enough of hearing them.  Strangly so, my 5yo dd loves them to, so we \\"must\\" listen to them over and over, which doesn't upset me at all.  Now, you may take this as a bad sign, since Raven is one of her favorites, but don't worry; she like alot of my 80's hair bands (Motley Crue, Judas Priest).  God forbid I have the radio on in my truck; she promptly reminds me with a serenade of \\"The Darkness\\".  Forget the other reviews of disappointment; \\"trying to sound like Queen\\"!  So what!  The Darkness does indeed rock...
B000002KZA|5.0|In my opinion this is the best DM release,it's arguable but in my opinion it is,the reason i think so is because it's darker than the other releases plus i picked it up really cheap at a record shop a must own!
0451169514|5.0|I think It is the pinnacle of Stephen King's career, and is, of what I have read, the most terrifying book ever written.  At over a 1000 pages, it is one of King's massive works, and the length only serves to heighten the level of terror to a near frantic level.  The story examines the very nature of fear, and creates the best monster in literary history:  It.  It appears as the clown Pennywise, a child killing monster who lives in the sewers under the NEw England town of DErry.  But as the book progresses, we learn what It really is:  the avatar of evil, who feeds off people's darkest fears, and who can manifest Itself in whatever form they fear most.  The story is divided into two sections, which are interwoven throughout the novel.  THe first concerns the Summer of 1958, in which seven children engage in a battle against It.  The second section concerns the events of 1984, when the seven children, now grown up, return to Derry, where It has begun to kill again, to defeat it for a final time.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|Known by some as the Minnesota Mover, Dylan produced his most moving collection of songs with \\"Blood On The Tracks\\". In obvious pain from a failing marriage, Dylan moves from pain, \\"you're A Big Girl Now\\" to bitter rage \\"Idiot Wind\\" and every emotion in between \\"Shelter From The Storm\\", \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\". \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is simply among the best songs every written, and is performed by Dylan here with a wrenching, soul exposing honesty that fails to reach only the unreachable. 32 years since it's creation, this collection of songs are as relevant today as the day they were written, and will remain so, since they are timeless reflections on the human condition, as so much of Dylans' best work is. Ignore to your considerable detriment. This is truly art.

B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is by far not given the credit it deserves.  It's judged against masterpieces like Kid A and OK Computer, but Thief is just as good. <br /> <br />The flaw is that the mood of thief is completely set.  Where in OK Computer, radiohead gave you a mix of airy-distance and would offset it with heavy guitar on other tracks, thief aims at one thing: gloomy bleakness.  The same dark undertone follows this entire album from start to finish.  I worry that this may be why it was not perfectly recieved, because people are not using this album to accent the mood is aims for. <br /> <br />This album never looks to expand or broaden itself.  It's essentially 14 tracks that all perfectly blend to carry this aura throughout it.  People just need to learn to listen to this album at the right times, because at the right time, it's flawless...

B000BVD460|1.0|Alright, first off we have this eminem GREATEST HITS CD. You would think with an album with the title \\"Curtain Call\\" that Em would at least make it a real album, especially if it is his last one. Nice job thanking the fans <br /> <br />Other than that Eminem's vioce annoys me (but that is kind of a cheap shot). Also Eminem's songs do nothing but talk about how much he hates his mom/women/gay people. I understand that every artist has the right to express themself, but he just repeats himself all the time. If he had one song about hating women, one track about hating his mom, one track about hating his mom, and then rapping about a party, or (god forbid) tell a REAL story like old DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince or Slick Rick couldn't hurt. Saying \\"I took the girl upstairs and *&%$ed her!\\" ISN'T A STORY!!! <br /> <br />But honestly the only reason why Em is even so big is because parents hate him and those little mall kids in the suburbs will like him for that. Its funny because parents used to be afraid of people like Vanilla Ice and Kid 'N Play, and now they are considered \\"soft\\".  <br /> <br />If you haven't heard of Eminem, just download the tracks off of a peer to peer network. Its not worth your money.

B000BT97AO|5.0|I have always been interested in anything from the Henson company and this was something I was looking forward to seeing ever since I seen the preview.  I was more than pleased.  I didn't know what to expect at first but was hoping for some insane visuals and great characters and special effects.  It was all that plus!~<br /><br />My eyes could not leave the screen the entire duration of the movie.  Everything was so visual, the photography was spectacular, it put you right into the movie.  The colors were a little strange but it still gave you the feeling of fantasy so I guess it is right on.<br /><br />The music was fun to listen to as well, there were some nice groovy bass lines although sometimes the music was a little overpowering but it didn't take away from the movie.  I couldn't pin down who did the music but I wouldn't mind looking into it some more.<br /><br />On to the characters.  The main characters were okay, nothing special but solid and believable.  The young lady who played the main part did an excellent job.  But the real story is the CG/puppet characters.  There were so many of them and so diverse and interesting.  I would have hoped for more puppets than CG but so be it.  I'll take what I can get.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot.  I didn't want to bring it back when I rented it.  But alas, I did.  Now I need to get it and see it again!  Enjoy the movie, it is fun for those that like fantasy and interesting characters.

0684824906|5.0|The author clearly presented to me how Lincoln's inner circle of  cabinet members were able to help him navigate the turbulent times of the US Civil War. Each of Lincoln's political Republican rivals, Chase, Seward and Bates ran against him and lost. Lincoln then chose them to be on his team when he started his presidency. Many saw this as a telltale sign for disaster and betrayl. One of them turned on him just prior to his second term and denied it. Another resigned, at the beginning of his second term. The other, to everyone's surprise became his most faithful co-pilot. The author's use of photos is superbly done. Only one image of war dead, which is enough. Photos of each of the cabinet members families is nicely shown so that as you read about their familes, you turn back to see what they looked like. A very strong portion of the book os about Stanton, whom Lincoln recrutied from the Buchanan administration. The description of how Stanton was able to get troops transferred within 48 hours to the war front was one of the most critical points of the war, so much so, that Grant said that the Union owes a geat debt to the administrative genius of this man. The assasination is only given a few pages but the decsription of how Seward was almost killed is vivid and scary. I was stricken with how deadly the actions of a small group of men could shake the leadership of our country. I recommend this book.

B000B8QG4A|3.0|As my mum's collecting the Disney special editions DVD for her so far non existant grandchildren (Little Mermaid is going in my DVD case though!), we got this - and our free Lady toy, which I took - the latest in the Disney re-releases. No doubt there will another in a few years.<br /><br />I can't really remember much about watching Lady & The Tramp originally, I know I had it on video, but I know it was never my favourite Disney movie. Watching it again after so many years, I found it sad, funny, and altogether, a great Disney movie. There wasn't as many annoying Disney songs as there usually are.<br /><br />What's great about this movie, is it shows that any girl can fall for a bad guy. Especially from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" as it goes. Tramp's the ultimate bad guy, although not my type, considering he's a dog.<br /><br />The funniest scene has to be either any scene that Jock, the scottish terrier is in, or the beaver scene. So funny! I was crying with laughter at that, hearing the beaver whistle through his teeth whenever he tried to say \\"s\\". And the final bit, where he pulls the log, and rolls down the hill - if I'd actually been concentrating properly on any of the movie, I would have had to stop the movie to calm myself down.<br /><br />This is also the latest Disney movie to \\"benefit\\" from a straight-to-DVD/video sequel. Walt would be spinning in his grave, seeing his precious movies reduced to garbage, straight into the hands of the fat cats.<br /><br />The extras aren't up to much either, in fact the only one I tried, was the board game, and I failed miserably. I kept getting the questions about Disney 'movies' I haven't even seen Oliver & Company, and The Incredible Journey. How are you supposed to answer unless you've seen the movies?<br /><br />For future DVD releases, the extras should really be beefed up a bit, and Amazon, PLEASE put the Little Mermaid special edition on here, so I can put it on my wishlist! It's out in autumn!!!

B0006L16N8|1.0|Ok, so rush of blood to the head was ok, but this album is really sad and it is so over-rated. How can this band be so popular? The singles are annoying after 3 listens. Lets just face it. This band is a really poor radiohead ripoff. Get O.K. Computer instead. Coldplay always sounds like they are trying so hard, but they always fail to make anything more than cliche. Their melodies suck. Their arangments are uncreative. They just sound straight up anoying after a while. Don't buy this unless you want to be a pathetic slave to the mass media music market.

0307276902|4.0|I really loved this book, partly because I've had my own bouts with drugs, partly because I think its raw and in-your-face and I like that. Some people have called it \\"meritless\\", and to that I say that this book is written the way it is for a reason. It is NOT meant for fancy language, it is not meant for the type of scurtiny that so many people (many of which haven't read the book thank you Oprah) are subjecting it to. I find it hard to believe that anyone reading this could not be at least remotely touched by it in some way. It is repetitive, but you sort of sign up for that when you discover he's living in rehab. It is not for the faint of heart, but I recommend it regardless. This book is not a man who is complaining about his drug problems, only telling about them. Even if 18 pages of this book are under scrutiny, it remains a good, quick read (despite its 400+ pages). If a story is good, its good. You be the judge.

B000001IQH|5.0|This is the closest thing to a true punk album that we got in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, I do like 90's punk(most of the punk music I listen to comes from either the 90's or the 70's), but this, while its not my favorite album of the 90's, is the closest thing to a true punk album.<br /><br />Now, whether it be punk or not, this is an awesome album. I love how most of it is nonstop fun punk, and how the songs are just very good. I dunno, I don't have much to say about it other than it is a good album.<br />Though my favorite song on the album is Old Friend, I believe the track 4-8 region of the album is the strongest point. Contrary to popular love, I'm not a big fan of ruby soho. It's just so overplayed, and I didn't think it was a great song in the first place, now I just don't like it. It's definitely the most overrated Rancid song (along with fall back down). But beside that song, I pretty much love all the rest.<br /><br />I think this is the second best Rancid album, behind Life Won't Wait.

B00005JO1R|5.0|It could be said that \\"Walk the line\\" is a movie about the life of Johnny Cash, a very well-known American artist that overcame all kinds of difficulties to become famous and share his music with the public. However, it would be more accurate to point out that this film is centered both on Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and the love they had for each other.<br /><br />The opening sequence is wonderful, and will make you realize that you weren`t wrong in choosing to watch \\"Walk the line\\". That feeling is likely to be specially strong if, like me, you don't really know a lot about Johnny Cash, and just want to watch a good and entertaining film. Notwithstanding that, you will also end up learning quite a few things about one of the most important American musicians of all time, and about a period in which many conventions were being broken by new artists.<br /><br />This film tells the spectator about Johnny Cash's childhood and his bad relationship with his father (played by Robert Patrick), his time in the Air Force, and the beginnings of his music career, when he met people like Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Elvis (Tyler Hilton), and the love of his life, singer June Carter. There was a big problem though: Cash was already married to another woman, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), something that June didn't forget, and repeated to Johnny every time she rejected his attempts to go beyond a friendship.<br /><br />The scenes where Johnny struggles with his addiction to drugs and with depression are quite difficult to watch, probably due to the fact that Joaquin Phoenix delivers a splendid performance. Reese Witherspoon is also outstandingly good as June, the person that saves Johnny Cash from himself.<br /><br />All the same, I want to mention that \\"Walk the line\\" is not all about drama. There are funny moments too, and also some wonderful scenes recreating Johnny's concerts that allow you to listen to the real deal. Oh well, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one. I am seriously thinking about buying not only a cd with Cash's more important songs, but also another with the soundtrack of this movie. Listening to Phoenix singing \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" is no hardship!<br /><br />On the whole, I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough. It is not perfect, but it is the kind of movie that you simply must see and enjoy. No regrets  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatwell, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one.

0307276902|1.0|This book is a disgrace.  And I am not even referring to the fact that is a novel and not a memoir, although I find it impossible that anybody who has flown a commericial airline would believe the first 3 pages of this book on face value. <br /> <br />I am appalled at James Frey's writing.  He borders on the illiterate.  This book is so poorly written it astounds me.  He has no grasp of the English language whatsoever.  He is perpetuating a crisis that we currently have in this country by not using even minimal punctuation or grammar skills - no wonder why the illiteracy rate is so high!   <br /> <br />He is a spoiled boy of privilege who is trying to build himself up to something he is not.  And he is an insult to anyone who struggles in the recovery of addiction. <br /> <br />I am simply horrified that anyone with half a brain thinks this book is good and he is a good writer.

B00004D0DU|5.0|I've read numerous review from people who believe that this film is a crime in itself, that it makes light of the Holocaust and ignores the depth of human tragedy that occurred during that unspeakable period in time.  Those who think in this manner do not understand how \\"remembrance\\" takes place, do not understand the human psyche.  Only survivors can know the true horror; the millions of humans who did not live that horror cannot comprehend it.  Attempts to MAKE them comprehend it, put forth in anger and guilt, only numb us to its realities.  I've read many histories of the Holocaust, many accounts; I respect those who lived through the nightmare enough to believe them when they tell me that \\"You who did not go through this can never understand.\\"  They are right.  And so, as an artist, how do I help the world remember?  If we must force ourselves to remember--and to honor those who died, to keep ourselves from repeating history, we are morally responsible for remembrance--than we must do so in a manner that the millions who did NOT experience the Holocaust can comprehend.  And that is done by juxtaposing the human next to the inhumane; laughter next to horror (to a level we can imagine it).  It is this juxtaposition--the beautiful next to the monstrous--that helps those who were not there remember their own humanity, and honor the memory of those who suffered and died. The monstrous can only be depicted in art through imagination; the reality can never be depicted.  But that holy, redemptive juxtaposition of the sacredness of life next to utter inhumanity helps we, the ones who have the moral responsiblity to remember, keep continually aware of both our responsibility and our humanity.  And that juxtaposition is precisely what \\"Life is beautiful\\" accomplishes.  Spielberg did the same with \\"Schindler's List\\" (in a more straightforward manner, but the same juxtaposition).  Both films were denigrated by those who erroneously believe that flogging the world with angerand guilt is the way to honor those who died.  It is not; instead, such actions kill the victims of the Holocaust again and again.  Honoring the beauty of the life force that was robbed from them is how we keep their memory alive, and how we promise them that it will never happen again.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I'm biased when I say this movie was underrated. Peter Jackson, in my mind, surpassed his own paramount in LOTR with King Kong. And yet, because of its length and its dependence on CG effects, this movie was criticized wrongly. This is one of the best films of 2005, if not the most rounded and complete. The story is not only a step up from the original, but it comically nods to the original, once again showing Jackson's love and respect for the 1933 version. So few remakes can capture the audience like the original, but Kong certainly comes close. What people saw in 1933 is probably comparable to this masterpiece that Jackson has created here. Everything is working in this film: the acting, the writing, the music (JAMES NEWTON HOWARD!!), and above all the effects. And not just Kong, which makes the CG Hulk look like a Looney Toon, but everything is so grandiose and marvelous that you can't help but become immersed in the environment. The climactic scene atop the Empire State Building is probably one of the most amazing scenes I have ever viewed on film. It is absolutely beautiful. If I have to concede anything negative about this movie, it's that Jack Black had to utter the final line in the film. If Fay Wray had lived long enough, it would have made the moment flawless. But I digress, since I have yet to find anything negative about the film itself. Peter Jackson previously caught my attention with Lord of the Rings, but with King Kong he showed me that he is not a one-tune director. He is probably one of the best directors in the business right now, since he has the money to make the movies HE wants to make (not the ones WE want him to make. It's an important distinction). Above all, I cannot get over how amazed I was by this film. Truly, it is a masterpiece in the medium, and I pains me to read how viciously some people attack it, without taking the time to truly understand the message. Sometimes filmmakers get caught up in the grandeur of the spectacle. But in Peter Jackson's case, King Kong is a spectacle that defies reality. <br /> <br />Buy it. Watch it. Love it.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Little surprise to see all the wheedling five-star votes for this gritty sci-fi thriller. This is no breezy glide through the outer world. In its unusual blend of sharp-shooting space cowboys and oriental mythology, it yokes together something proprietary to its fantastic world, something that has the electricity to make it all seem worthwhile.<br /><br />The scene is 500 years from now. A bunch of renegades fly around in space, spewing witty banter more than anything more productive -- but really, the dialogue is sharp throughout. Abroad this ship is a psychic girl, who for her dazzling powers had been apparently captured and trained by the 'Alliance' (those big bad unseen powers in charge of the universe, as usual) in a top secret program to manufacture human weapons, but has since been rescued by her brother and brought back to the ship.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, the Alliance must now spread its whiz-bang tentacles and repossess her. Which in turn sets us up for a lickety-split chase-athon of a flick, with all its twists and turns and bone-crunching bursts of martial art. Surprisingly, the actors are pretty confident in their parts, which is impressive considering that I had never seen any of them before. Particular praise for the captain of the ship, the psychic girl, and the lead operative of the Alliance who sports a British accent, but that's eminently forgivable.<br /><br />Strongly recommended if you are looking to snazz up a slow weekend and have had patience for Starwars type fare.
B0009O9LWK|1.0|The 1970 TV version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of my favorites, not the least of which for John Williams' early and exceedingly haunting score.    There are at least seven different DVD packages of this film on Amazon. As a test, I ordered seven of them. Although they have not all arrived, the ones that have without a doubt all outshine the Collector's Choice version by far. \\"Digitally remastered\\" is proclaimed on the box but it is a lie. The print appears to be third generation at best and the sound is muddy. My rating, however, refers to the fact that several scenes are included in the other (and more watchable) versions I've received. I estimate that about 10 minutes has been excised from the print. Judging from all the varied releases on many labels out there, my guess is that this is somehow in public domain. I highly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" on DVD -- except for this one! I'm using it as mini-Frisbee for polishing up my dog's catching ability.
B00005JOII|4.0|If it were not for the opening monologue on luck, the cleverly planted clue in the movie's most tense moments, and the jaw-dropping denouement, you might think this was just anyone's movie. It doesn't scream Woody Allen, yet perhaps for that reason, is one of the best from his serious genre.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the perfect lead, dark and brooding, and very believable as Chris Wilton, the Irish tennis player who ingratiates himself into an upper crust English family. Likewise, Emily Mortimer hits all the right notes to come across as the family's sweet and pampered daughter Chloe who is instantly attracted to him and opens up a life of wealth and privilege he has only dreamed about.  Although Chris finds Chloe \\"sweet\\" it is Nola, as portrayed by a sultry and seductive Scarlett Johansson, that arouses his passions.  The fly in the ointment is that Nola is engaged to Chloe's brother Tom, as portrayed by Matthew Goode.  Of course, passion wins out and overcomes reason, morals, and good judgment.<br /><br />Rhys Meyers gives the perfect angst-ridden performance as he desperately tries to cover up the affair and is at his peak as the movie's chilling tragedy plays out.  Because the characters are portrayed so perfectly by all the actors, the viewer cannot help but be drawn to them and caught up in their sordid story.<br /><br />When the movie ended, no one in the theater rushed out, but sat momentarily stunned and eager to discuss with fellow moviegoers.  I think that would make Woody Allen smile.

B00005JKG9|5.0|David Mamet's play, \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is beautifully translated into the silver screen medium.  Even though it is a movie, it runs like a play.  It uses only two locations.  The strength of this film lies with its actors and the dialogue.<br /><br />Put the talents of Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Alec Baldwin, and you can't help but hit the bullseye with this one.<br /><br />The story takes place in a small real estate office where four men are in the cut-throat business of real estate.  The constant pressures of deception, working for and against each other, tells a most provocative story.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon turns in his most impressive work which is a turn from his usual up-beat comedic characters.  As Shelly \\"the Machine\\" Levine, he plays the part of a wise-cracking, yet desperate man perfectly.  Levine is a man who has been in the game for many years.  At one time, his status was almost legendary.  Now, he can barely scrape by, and no one cares or remembers his golden years as a top salesmen except for Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who still holds Levine with the utmost respect.<br /><br />Al Pacino is equally brilliant as Ricky Roma, the current top dog in the office whose hot streak is still hot, and he knows it.  He's sitting on top of the world, and hardly has time or the inclination to hear the grumblings of Dave (Ed Harris) who can't stand him.<br /><br />Ed Harris plays the part of Dave, a man who no longer gives a damn, and is frankly, fed up with his work situation, and vows to do something about it.  He holds contempt for everyone except for George (Alan Arkin) who nods and agrees with everything Dave says like an robot, but hasn't the courage to take the necessary steps to break out.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is John Williamson who is the office manager.  The man takes more abuse from his team of salesmen than any character I've ever seen, as they hurl one profane word at him after another.  He's young and doesn't have the experience or knowledge of Ricky or Levine, but he still holds the power in the office, and in the end, it's all he needs to maintain his status and control.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin is only in the film for about 5 minutes, but he turns in the best scene in the entire film as he plays Blake, a high-up executive who tells this team of \\"f**king losers\\" that he would just as soon fire their asses because \\"a loser is still a loser.\\"  He is on a mission of mercy to tell them about a contest for the top sales man.  \\"First place is a Cadillac.  Second place is a set of steak knives.  Third place...is the door!\\"  He treats them all with a fierce contempt.  He's a power executive, and these \\"peasants\\" are literally nothing to him.  \\"I made $900,000 last year.  How much did you make?\\" he sneers at them.  \\"See this watch?  This watch costs more than your car!\\"  Even Levine fails to impress him.<br /><br />The dialogue in this film is so good, that you just sit and marvel at the performances.  Word has it that during their off-days, the actors would come to the set to watch each other.<br /><br />I never get tired of watching this film.  It is beautifully made.  Despite being laced with nearly 300 expletives, the tone, the energy, and the strength behind this film are so profound that you can't help but be roped into it.  There are so many memorable lines, that you will A: always B: be Q: quoting them!ine, but he still holds the power in the office, and in the end, it's all he needs to maintain his status and control.

B000007T1M|5.0|Along with Toxicity, this is my favorite ablum by any group that I have heard.  Every song is great and unlike most music it gets better and better the more you listen to it.  Highly reccomended.  Much better than their new music even though that is not bad either.
0394873742|5.0|I ordered this book as a Christmas gift for my 12 month old son and he has enjoyed this book more than any other book that I have bought for him.  He just loves to sit on it and point at the many pictures on its pages.  It is sturdy enough to take some abuse and is just a must have for every child.  Just for extra information Sesame Street has a big book for sale on Amazon as well if your child is a die hard Sesame Street fan.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have viewed many films shot in Technicolor but with out a doubt this is THE finest Technicolor restoration you will ever see.  This is a great example of what Technicolor is capable of.  They did a great job.  The color registation (i.e. alignment) is right on.  The balance is perfect and the saturation is is toned down considerably, much more natural than previous release prints.    This DVD version of The Adventures of Robin Hood along with the companion \\"Glorious Technicolor\\" is a visual treat and well worth owning!
B000002HPV|3.0|\\"Homogenic\\" is an album that I really love half of. A few of the songs are among her very best, but then there's the other few. I keep this and like it for the great opener \\"Hunter\\", \\"Joga\\", the beautiful and simple \\"Unravel\\", and the excellent \\"All Is Full Of Love\\". She also had amazing videos for some of these songs. The rest is still ok, it just doesn't stand-out to me. Overall I enjoy \\"Debut\\", and especially \\"Post\\" alot more. I do love the cover art for \\"Homogenic\\" also. This is probably still a must for big fans, though others would do fine with her \\"Greatest Hits\\".
B00003CXCW|5.0|What more can be said about Sunset Boulevard that hasn't already been said.  It was arguably Billy Wilder's finest film he ever made and also my personal favorite.  Watching this film will give you a good example of what makes a great film great; you start off with a crisp, well written screenplay with a good storyline and plot along with great performances and beleive me this one has it in spades!  Then, talk about great casting; Gloria Swanson was made for that role, why she did't win an Oscar is beyond belief!   Did Hollywood really hate the movie that much?   <br /> <br />After 55 years, the restoration of the original film elements was quite remarkable.  The new DVD version is excellant.  When projected on to my 8 foot screen, the picture so extremely crisp and sharp that you can see every tiny little check on William Holden's sport jacket!   This is a treasure from the vaults and well worth owning.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Hollywood moguls should be required to actually READ the books they turn into movies. This is not a bad interpretation of \\"Sahara\\" but it could be so much BETTER.  Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler's sophisticated, clear-thinking hero..sweaty, grubby and smelly looking with a Texas twang?? Pahleeze!! Loyal, sturdy, reliable Al Giordino reduced to being a goofy sidekick?? No, No, No! And Rudi Gunn, a brilliant scientist and 2nd in command at NUMA as - what? - a college sophomore on spring break?? Just when fans think it couldn't get worse..Admiral James Sandecker, a man of power and authority, turned into a somewhat befuddled mid-management type!! EGADS!! The travesty of it all!! I implore people with intelligence and imagination to read the book.  It's WAY better.
0060763280|3.0|People waste a lot of money on books promising to make them rich or skinny. I'll cut to the chase, and tell you how to do both:<br /><br />To get richer, spend less of your money.<br /><br />To get skinnier, eat less food.<br /><br />I guess another way to get rich is to write a bestseller telling people they need a \\"money blueprint.\\" It's not until page 127 the author mentions how most people actually become rich -- by being in business for themselves.<br /><br />I'm giving this book three stars because the author is a good storyteller. The psychology of money is fascinating. But my sense is, if you're doing well in life, reading this book will probably make you feel better about yourself. If things aren't going so well, this book will probably make you feel worse. When the author isn't dispensing common-sense advice, he's pigeon-holing certain behaviors and predicting the life outcomes. If you enjoy judging and being judged, you might enjoy the book more.<br /><br />To be fair, this book does give some good suggestions for taking action in your life. If you need a push to start a project, or to ask for a promotion at work, perhaps this will give you the spark. But c'mon! Who really thought you'd become a millionaire without doing anything?
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a must see - in the genre of telling the story before the more famous story. <br />
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Though the reviews for this movie were a bit on the harsh side, I quite enjoyed this.  It won't be making any lists of my favorite animated films, but it certainly was far better than I was led to expect that it would be.  The film was Disney's first computer generated film, all their other releases being Pixar productions.<br /><br />The film attempts to flesh out the rather bare bones story of Chicken Little, who claimed that the sky was falling.  In this case, the sky truly was falling, in that parts of it were alien space ships that have the ability to disguise themselves like chameleons by assuming the appearance of their background.  This plot device was actually my least favorite part of the movie.  What makes the film work is how it functions on a momemnt to moment basis.  There are a score of excellent comedic moments, well-realized concepts, and great jokes.<br /><br />As with virtually all CGI films, CHICKEN LITTLE is great to look at.  What I love about these movies is that they seem to take you into a different physical universe.  They look almost photo-realistic, but keep enough of a sense of unreality to seem magical.  At least part of the charm is the way they keep the viewer visually stimulated.<br /><br />The voice talent is not quite in the superstar category, but they do a great job anyway.  Zach Braff of SCRUBS is superb as Chicken Little.  He does so many voice overs on the show with his inner monologues that fans of the show will find this eerily familiar at times.  Joan Cusack is great as his mallard buddy, while Steve Zahn gets a lot of great moments as Runt.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was a fine film.  Again, it isn't the best movie you'll ever see, but if you are in the mood for a light animated film, this should serve fine.
B000777J2S|1.0|This is the absolute worst voice I have ever heard.  My girlfriend and I were out of town this past Valentines Day weekend and decided to go spend some money on CD's for the drive home.  We bought this disc because it had stickers on the packaging that said it won awards, the artwork looked decent, and it was all over the HMV store with recommendations galore..how could it be bad?     It was part of the \\"2 for $25\\" deal and we needed something else to get the sale price. The promotion made this seem like it was something we HAD to check out....    ...Boy, were we wrong.    The vocals completely ruin the very relaxing mood set by the music.  It is actually very good until the singing takes over, an instrumental version of the album would be great...but \\"Antony\\" seriously needs to take that disgustingly \\"unique\\" voice and call it quits.      I am not too critical when it comes to music...if I dislike something it's usually just \\"not my thing\\" and I won't waste time discussing it in a negative way, but the vocals on this album literally made me uncomfortable to the point where I cringed and felt sick.  It's like nails on a chalkboard.      If you're unfamiliar, take Morrissey's voice  (which i like very much) and give him a cold and a banana in his throat leaving a slight air passage to get sound out.  Next, play it through the worst speaker you can find.  Be sure to do this at a time that you are in the worst mood of your life.  Then place the speaker on a vibrating massage chair and add reverb and echo.  Sounds pretty horrible, right?  Antony's voice is worse.    After a few days decided to give this a second run through just to see if i was being too harsh.  I definitely was not.  The best song on here is \\"What Can I Do?\\" which features Rufus Wainwright on vocals.  I'm not even a fan of Rufus, but it's a good song and his Thom Yorke-esque sound on this track is a relief.  At one point on this track you can faintly hear Antony in the background and it makes me cringe.  This is also (unfortunately) the shortest track on the album at about 1:30 leading right back into more Antony.  Great! ....    The vibrato in Antony's voice is probably very difficult to pull off, and it's definitely \\"out of the ordinary\\" when it comes to vocals, but this is by far one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased/heard.
0743454537|2.0|This book addresses a deep moral conundrum -- if you have a child with a really hard-to-treat form of cancer, is it right (and to what extent) to have another child that can act as an organ donor? The story is told from different viewpoints -- the donor daughter, the mother, the father -- everyone, in fact, but the sister with the cancer. In case you don't get it that these are different people talking, each chapter appears in a different typeface, and it is this kind of beat-the-reader-over-the-head-with-the-obvious approach that put a damper on my reading enthusiasm. No nuance was left unexplained. As a result, the characters come across as figureheads for didactic points of view rather than real people with real conflicts. The writer is obviously seasoned, and descriptions and dialog flow along glibly and seamlessly, if not with any great originality. The ending to the book -- which cleverly avoids actually making the difficult choices that have been so painstakingly and painfully developed -- is completely contrived and absolutely annoying.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|Creator Joss Whedon's science-fiction Firefly (Whedon's third series after Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) was cancelled after only 11 of the 14 episodes had aired on the Fox network back in 2002. However, if you want to see a movie about this cancelled TV series you've come to the right place. That is what Serenity is. It is not a stand-alone film that's easy or desirable for the general public to watch whether rented or purchased.<br /><br />I sure didn't enjoy it. It was all over the place jumping around, difficult to follow, with a kind of Han Solo/Indiana Jones space-cowboy lead character. Fans of the show clearly are not finding it hard to follow and are enjoying Serenity thoroughly. Fans are rejoicing to get the loose ends of the cancelled series tied up in this movie. But I picked up this movie thinking that the movie was a new sci-fi theatrical release with no prior TV history. My bad.<br /><br />Serenity is a movie for the disappointed fans (and apparently there are a lot of them) of what was perhaps a decent TV series. I wouldn't really know about that though because I never watched Firefly. There is a big diversion between fans and critics. Fans say it was unjustly and prematurely cancelled. But the other side of the coin is that the quality of the show was conspicuous by its cancellation.<br /><br />So fans, please don't be mad at me for this negative review...rather appreciate the warning for naive, impulse movie purchasers like myself: Viewers that were not Firefly fans should proceed with caution.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I liked this album on the first listen. After the second, I was planning to pick up a copy on the way to the pub. By the fourth it found a place in my daily rotation.<br /><br />The album lands under the genre \\"Garage Rock Revival\\" which houses notables such as The White Stripes, The Vines and And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead. Comparison: first album Black Crowes (i.e. shake your money maker) mixed with third album White Stripes (i.e. white blood cells), with more natural blues sensitivity thrown in and you'd have a smoothy that tasted much like this album sounds; refreshing.<br /><br />(from [...]
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is one of those sound tracks that holds it's own with or without the movie.  Mood changes and sing-a-longs included. The kind of CD you'll want to keep in your car for long drives that will keep you from getting bored or tired along the way.
B00004Z459|4.0|The first song I heard on this album was \\"In the End\\" and I seriously considered buying this album but didn't. After I heard some other songs I decided to get this and was grateful I did. The music Linkin Park makes is powerful, hard and sometimes noisy, but has a way of grasping people to listen to nothing else. I like their lyrics, although it's too aggresive. The titles of their album fits with their theme and even the pictures are well-taken. To tell you the truth I've been expecting more from this album and was a bit disappointed after I purchased it, but I liked it enough to kept buying their second album. <br />\\"Papercut\\", the first song is a powerful start about a person with two sides. \\"Point of Authority\\" is one of my favorites, \\"Crawling\\" is a slower song but also very powerful, it really has gotten you feeling the nightmare in the lyrics, and \\"Runaway\\" is certainly a catchy one. \\"In the End\\" is the very best, the only song I know how to rap all the way through and the only song I still don't get tired of. There is not one boring note in this song! <br />Linkin Park has good music and good lyrics, but their songs are too alike and might run out of ideas on the long run. I trust that they are creative but they aren't coming out with new kind of music. Meteora is still as similar as ever (except \\"Numb\\") so I don't think I'll be buying their third album, unless they come up with new ingredients.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Grey's Anatomy is one of my absolute favorite TV shows. The only thing I didn't like about Season 1 was the fact that there are only 9 episodes. But those 9 episodes are GREAT! <br /> <br />The only thing I dislike about the DVD set: If you choose an episode to watch, you have to go back to the main menu after you start the episode and turn off the subtitles. (I've tried turning them off and then choosing the episode but it doesn't work.) It's just a little annoying. There's also no scene selection feature. Again, another small annoyance. <br /> <br />But again, the show is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good medical drama. <br /> <br />(And I don't think they all put down nurses. Alex does, yes, but he's a pig. I think Meredith was reacting to the fact that he called her a nurse when she is a doctor and the only reason he made that comment was because he is a pig. If you've seen Season 2, you see that all the doctors clearly know how much they depend on nurses.)
0425173739|5.0|Another book written so cleverly by Agatha Christie that it makes me think is a work of a genius. Not only is the title  attractive already, the story is more grasping than Christie's other novels: <br />Young Linnett Ridgeway has everything one can dream of: beauty, brains, money. If she wants something,she'll get it. She doesn't even rest when her best friend Jaqueline de Bellefort brings her handsome fiance Simon Doyle in hopes for finding a job at Linnett's-- soon Simon and her newlywed Linnett are on their honeymoon in Egypt, stalked by an angry and jealous Jackie. A few days later, Linnett Ridgeway dies of a bullet through the head in her sleep-- a murder. Maybe Ridgeway's cold-hearted selfishness backfired... or not. <br />   Because Jackie is soon backed with a strong alibi and everyone's trust that she did not murder her ex-best friend. So the mystery becomes almost unsolvable, with alibis and witnesses scattered all over the places like puzzle pieces waiting for Hercule Poirot and his little gray brain cells to return them to their right places. <br />   The murder is structured in a way so unique you wouldn't figure it out-- typical Christie. This novel is my favorite yet out of all of the Hercule Poirot series because the ending is most resonable, and you go through that twice: once with Hercule Poirot, giving us his theories and the other time with the murderer, telling us his or her (I won't tell!) motive, plans and feelings through the whole thing. There's not only suspense in this thing, there's also romance and realistic thoughts and anger. In the end you don't just categorize the murderer as the villain or the bad guy, but someone with feelings too strong and lets killing get out of hand. Once again the unbreakable alibis were broken, things were sorted into the right places, and this is a must-read for everybody, a classic throughout the centries.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I took my 7 year old son and 5 year old daughter to this movie thinking it was going to be a boring kids movie. Boy was I surpised when I laughed just as much as my kids, may be more. There was adult humor and songs from my past that went right by them but was very funny to me!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is beautiful. It has every kind of music you can possibly fit into one album-- pop, rock, Latin, hip hop. Christina's voice is also beautiful, and the way she sings ballads on this album like \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Cruz\\", and the higher notes on \\"Dirrty\\" is just the way a singer should sing. <br />Some people might think this album is dirty and Christina is too sexed up-- well I'd admit that she changed a lot from her previous works, but that is for the better and the naked picture just means that she isn't hiding anything. If this is part is commercialized, it's working very well! The best songs are \\"Dirrty\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", and \\"Infatuation\\". I like \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" although the lyrics are dirty and \\"Cruz\\"... a very beautiful song.  <br />When you see an album that has almost every kind of music ever made, the poeple who don't like Christina says that she steals things from other artists, and people who like her say that she is a talented singer/songwriter who has every single thing in her album and it's original. Whichever way you want to believe it is totally up to you.  I must say there are too much interludes in this album so it isn't really twenty songs, just seventeen or less. Singers nowadays should be more like this, we should kick sexed up trash like Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan who are hiding under the protection of modern technology out of the music industry. This album covers everything from love to violence, excitement to complaint and is a must-have for all.

B00005JOM9|4.0|Felicity Huffman's performance, though commended, was a bit contrived as was the rest of the performances. At times I didn't know what to think of the film: is it comedy or drama? Is it a joke or serious?<br /><br />Those misgivings were really a tiny part of my experience. I really did enjoy watching Transamerica and I think it's a great moviegoing experience. I wouldn't count on it to be enlightening, though.<br /><br />Bree (Felicity Huffman), formerly Stanley, is about to undergo a gender-reassignment surgery in Los Angeles when she learns that she has a troubled teenage son named Toby (cutie Kevin Zegers). Bree cannot deal with that issue before her surgery, but her therapist puts the surgery on hold until Bree sorts things out with her newfound son.<br /><br />Bree flies out to NY to bail Toby out of jail but fails to tell him the truth about who she really is. One thing leads to another and both characters find themselves going on a trip cross-country to Los Angeles.<br /><br />The dynamics between Bree and Toby is what Transamerica is all about. It's a non-preachy, very interesting and very controversial perspective on a slice of society that's marginalized by the mainstream and further marginalized by other already-marganalized groups as well!<br /><br />Go see it!
0441009425|3.0|The broad scope and century spanning reach of this story was fascinating. However, I have to admit there was not one single character in this book that I gave damn about when all was said and done. In far future Sci-Fi the reader often wants to feel connected to his own time by way of cultural or historic references. Reynolds didn't do this enough in my judgement.  <br /> <br />The story kept me turning pages and I never felt it bogged down where my mind started to wander. The archaeological mysteries of the extinct Amarantin were the most compelling aspect of this book. The relationship between Sylveste (the main character, I think) and his father, Calvin was also a very interesting look into the future of humanity. The concept of saving off ones mind (and personality) into permanent digital storage for future generations to ineract with is something we may yet see in our lifetimes in some way. <br /> <br />I may have opted for a 4 star rating if the ending had been at all satisfying. Unfortunately, as with a lot stories in the Sci-Fi genre this author has a hard time devising and ending that matches in scale and imagination of the complex premises that led us to the final pages in hopes of putting it all together. When you add the search on the part of the reader for some reason to care about at least one character in this story the disappointment is multiplied. Honestly, Revelation Space may be the last Alastair Reynolds book I read... There is an awful lot of very satisfying Sci-Fi out there, I just know it.
140004281X|3.0|I was disappointed in this collection and was surprised to find so many critics raving about it. Her plot devices here seem forced and amateurish. (Most evident in the title story and in \\"Tricks.\\") Her writing has always been based on interesting coincidences and chance meetings years down the road, but they are becoming more and more unbelievable. Also, her themes are getting tired. They seem to be constricted to tales about cheating wives, spinsters, and poor farmgirls. For better Alice Munro, try \\"Friend of My Youth,\\" \\"Open Secrets\\" or any of her early collections. Three stars because she is still the best writer out there.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a good movie.  For the reviewers who say that had this movie been about a man a woman-then the critics wouldn't have fawned all over this movie are crazy.  First of all, this story could have never been about a man and a woman.  The dynamics of the story is about suppressing a natural instinct (love) for the sake of society's taboos.  This was 1963.  For a man to announce to the world that he loved another man meant death-as Ennis said.  These two men forced themselves to live lives based on what was expected of them: a wife-children.  And to do what was expected meant to deny themselves--no matter how painful.  To a large degree we still expect the gay community to do what society deem fit and proper.  No marriages.  No adoption.  No healthcare.  Walk this way.  Talk this way.<br /><br />And for those who want to know what each saw in each to make them LOVE each other.  Who can explain those things?  Love is no rhyme or reason.  It's a feeling and sometimes you're lucky if you can capture that feeling on film--and I think Heath and Jake did a wonderful job of doing just that.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Yes, I said music.  This album is probably one the most ambitious albums ever to come out in our music.  Although being so ambitious will only lead to uncommercialism.  But if that is what TMV needs to be noticed, not as \\"one of those bands\\" but as a recognized band, they will jump head over heels.   <br /> <br />This CD has instrumentals, electronic, and radically eclectic moments in the CD you actually have to listen to actually take interest in it.  A good example is \\"The Widow.\\"  When I first heard the last two minutes and twenty seconds, I do admit that I thought it was \\"noise.\\"  But listen to one thing at once before taking in everything because then you won't be particularily amazed.  When listening to \\"The Widow,\\" I listened to the high-pitched beeping sound that flew from the left speaker to the right and back again.  Listening, I noticed the time went by a lot faster then when listening to all the sounds.   <br /> <br />Another one you might may be the first four minutes of \\"Miranda.\\"  This opening is equally good.  Listen to the dramatic changes as the minutes roll by.  And for those who think there is crickets in the four minutes are heavily mistaken.  I've found these changes so far in the first four minutes of Miranda: <br /> <br />00-1 (crickets) <br />1-2 (quiet, but noticable, eerie humming) <br />2-3 (background music becomes much more noticable) <br />3-4 (deeper humming is evident and lasts until the finale of the foreword with trumpets) <br /> <br />If you look at \\"Miranda\\" in layers, you will most likely find it a very good song.   <br /> <br />Yet part of a song is the end of \\"Cygnus.\\"  The ending is basically split into two different parts.  The beginning starts with fast drumming looped with electronic noises and beeps (if you listen to and pay attention) that will keep you entertained.  It fades away and comes back again with no electonic noises and fades away soon to stride into \\"The Widow.\\" <br /> <br />Here is why this album pretty muchprevails in everything rock music should do (probably what only classic rock music could do).   <br /> <br />-many guitar solos <br />-great singing (I'm talking about 5 octaves) <br />-excellent drumming (Theodore's amazing) <br />-an arsenal of different instruments <br />-wonderful lyrics (no need to explain) <br />-multiple beats (something lost in the translation of classic music to modern) <br />-talent <br /> <br />Basically, if you want a band that shows exaggerated amounts of talent, get this CD.  It shows even more talent then their amazing debut.  FTM really shines how well TMV can make inventive, creative, sophisticated, and hopefully one day, genre defining music (once someone gives them a label, impossible).

B000002J6F|5.0|Given how long this album has been out and many thorough reviews already published on this page, doubts about the need for further praise may be justified. This may be the case yet the width and weight of the music available through Manassas's debut, as powerful and current today as it was revolutionary then, must conclusively inspire many more testimonials.<br /><br />This is Stephen Stills at the height of his powers, something that has been amply demonstrated in his first solo album earlier on, and now augmented by one of the greatest line-ups anyone ever put together as a band. Yes, Manassas is a band. This is not \\"Stills' vehicle,\\" rather it's Stephen Stills leading a group of talented peers and feeding off the creative sparks they generated together.<br /><br />As I said before other reviews have dutifully listed the gifts of the many classic songs in Manassas, so for the sake of brevity, I won't go on detailing the beauties contained here. To end while I'm ahead, let me just say that this is American music at its best: Rock-Country-Blues-Folk and even some Latin influences condensed into an album that still has few equals.

B00005JOIF|4.0|It was much to bear to watch the eleven Israeli athletes of the 1972 Olympic Games slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, just as they had primed their young bodies and minds to a state of physical strength and endurance in Stephen Spielberg's, \\"Munich\\", but the carnage doesn't stop there, and if you brace yourself for the awful scenes of the athlete's assassinations, you still have to endure the slow death walk and gurgling bleed of a half naked enemy spy prostitute, and other agonizing deaths which possess a morbid fascination, the kind teenagers in the horror flick audience would find, \\"cool\\", and \\"awesome\\". It's often a Night of The Very Nearly Living Dead, as gunshot victims momentarily carry out their final acts, as if unaware of bullet holes through their foreheads and chests, until blood protrudes from them like ketchup released from a stuck bottle. Why this fascination with gore, is beyond me. Maybe it serves as companion to the horrific details of the film's inspiration, suggesting the expectations and perpetual motion of the Istraeli athletes were snuffed like a spent Olympian torch.<br /><br />It's a difficult film, given it's \\"inspired by true events\\" lead-in. With a free hand to examine the Munich execututions, Spielberg delivers an assured sense of actuality in depicting the State of Israel, seeking revenge against, as opposed to overwhelming, terrorism, and in finding the revenge seeking, justice fighters greatly outclassed in the world of high end spies and assassins. Their secret mission is exposed a number of times due to emotion level tactics, they fall prey to an obvious, seductive counter-assassin, they harbor a mole, and offer outragous sums of money to contacts for information. They mostly 'get their man', so to speak, but we could have told them the cost of terrorism is more terrorism.<br /><br />Without the historic events, \\"Munich\\" would make a fantastic espionage thriller. In detailing the history with a flair for the sensational, Spielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history. As The World Trade Center towers in the New York City skyline via trick photography near film's end, Spielberg tells us, history will repeat itself. His film's main objective is the conclusion that America did not do enough to support Israel's sense of justice regarding the Munich assassinations.<br /><br />Anyway you look at it, it's a film that shouldn't be missed.ielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history.

0812550706|5.0|Depth is just one of the ways Ender surprised me. This science fiction novel, which cavalierly refers to alien invaders as \\"Buggers,\\" the combined political force on Earth as the \\"Hegemon,\\" and zero gravity as \\"Nullo,\\" is deceptively simple. I loved being deceived.<br /><br />Not even seven years old yet, Ender Wiggin is hardly the person you'd expect to save the world, but when was the last time our perceptions were entirely correct? We often look at young people and think they're incapable of anything significant, anything world-changing. However, the Wiggin children - Peter, Valentine, and Ender - flip that perception on its head. Peter and Valentine gain power and influence in the anonymity of the worldwide Nets while Ender earns the respect and prestige of the world in Battle School.<br /><br />Whether by fate, choice, or dumb luck, Ender is forced to face some tough questions. Like Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener and Captain Ahab, Ender is dying to know the answer to the question \\"If I don't like this game of life they're trying to get me to play, do I have to play it?\\" What happens when someone just stops playing the games people expect them to, especially when the future of humanity is at stake? What exactly is murder? At the brink of extinction, is there anything a species isn't allowed to do in order to survive? What is it in humanity that makes it worth saving? And how far would you go for the person you love? Massive questions for a kid. Or anyone, for that matter.<br /><br />Card's Y.A. science fiction novel deserves all the acclaim it has and will be given. Winning both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Science Fiction and/or Fantasy achievement, its future is just beginning as people discover that Ender's Game has the makings of all things classic.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has everything that Star Wars was lacking... <br />It is a great series that should have never been cancelled. It goes to show that major broadcast companies don't really know what is interesting to the general public.  <br />I look forward to someone producing a second season...

0800141849|2.0|Even though I am not a Streisand fan, I was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was.  The plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible - to the main male character.  The problem is, she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover!  Somebody (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are disgusting. BAAAAAAMP!  (That's the fallacy alarm going off:  men, in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.)  <br />There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference! <br />Yet truly, the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand, discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, \\"Wazz I a pretty baby?  WAZZ I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?\\"  In that one scene, Streisand's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed.  The whole movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast, crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s emotional issues like that. <br />I really think that the \\"Funny Girl\\" phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes.  The media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think Ingrid Bergman.....).  I recall reading about how her glowing complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy and voice) carried her through despite her looks:  long nose, large lips, slanted eyes.  Myself, I think she looks like an Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like Grace Kelly..... <br />So why can't sheaccept this?  The majority of us women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do!  This movie is not about that.  This movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable.   <br />Maybe I should've given it only one star.
B0000214F0|4.0|Even though the plot of CALIGULA rates a standard B-, the real feast lies in the art direction and historical back drop.  Rome displayed deplorable morals compared to today.  Lots of nakedness.  Lots of lewd sex and promiscuity.  Incest and homosexuality. Pedaphilia and insanity.<br /><br />This represents the first, and only movie, that I believe uses hardcore/X-rated sexual images as mechanisms to propel the story. When viewing them, you will shake your head in disgust and fascination...<br /><br />..but that represents the appropriate way to view Rome: brilliant, but immoral.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|One of the most gruesome and horrifying films of the past two years, Saw engages the viewers in random acts of torture. <br /> <br />The movie stars Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Prince Of Tights) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), and the film's screenwriter Leigh Whannell. <br /> <br />Elwes and Whannell wake up chained from their ankles in a broken restroom with a dead body lying down before their eyes with a cell phone in one hand and a gun in the other. It turns out that a psychopathic maniac known only as Jigsaw is testing their will to live only if they abide by some the most grotesque rules of the 'game'. <br /> <br />Saw fared well at the box office. It also proved to be an entertaining modern day horror film that many people disregarded as being part of Hollywood's latest trend and fetish with trashy horror flicks. <br /> <br />For its creativity, Saw is a must see! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B <br /> <br />
B00003CXUM|5.0|I know that some reviewers are going to slam this movie calling it a stylish soap drama. But really have you seen the soap dramas imported from China courtesy of PBS? I have and there is no comparsion to be made between the two. The colors of the clothes and scenery are breathtaking. The awkward but shy glances that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan share between one another before entering their almost conjoining apartments back to their cheating spouses. Even the strange but delightful way their friendship starts in order to uncover the motives behind way her husband and his wife ever cheated on the both of them in the first place. I especially love the part where Mr. Chow informs Mrs. Chan that he is moving to Singapore to write for their newspaper. The look of shock and disappointment in her eyes and how she tries to discourage him from moving away. I am not going to spoil the end of the movie but I will say it broke my heart.

B000054OXU|5.0|I really think this album makes more sense in 2006 than 1986. I like Neil Young for Harvest and classic Neil, however this album is a refreshing album for me. Neil lovers should not buy this album ever! <br />There are abundant synths, and the drums sound synthetic. The guitar is sparse and the vocal rythms are enticing and symplistic. In the same way Ozzy's voice is limited yet enjoyable, so is Neil's. <br />The subject matter is dark and the whole thing does not sound like Neil - which upsets Neil lovers. People who can get over that and don't hate synths will enjoy this album.  <br /> <br />It does not suck like Avante Garde Pop or introspective emo cheese rock, so get over it and judge it as a completely different work than Neil Young folk rock.

B000002I25|5.0|The Doors unique sound is both sensual and sinister at the same time. It amazes me to think of the stark contrast of the day between such bands as The Grateful Dead and The Doors. An excellent example of rainbow and flowers vs dark and sinister. <br /> The stylings of organist Ray Manzarek alone is enough to send chills up one's spine, but when mixed with the precise beat of drummer John Densmore, amazing guitar play from Robby Krieger , <br />and the positively haunting voice of Jim Morrison the expierience is multiplied. If i may make one suggestion it would be to listen to the lyrics closely, but at the same time allow the music to shape its meaning. It's as good a trip The Doors ever took. Trust me.

Definately worth a shot
B000E1YVZU|2.0|How could they possibly eliminate the best song of the play (\\"And it's beginning to snow\\") from the movie, and claim the movie is a faithful reproduction of the play?  And since the movie did not add anything new, we can only conclude the movie is inferior to the play, by a song.  A big song. <br /> <br />
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|The movie franchise that started with Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" in the 1980's slowly transitioned from gothic thriller to an uneasy mix of Adam West camp and Bob Kane comics.  It was a wise decision for Warner Bros. to pretend those four movies never happened.    The result is Christopher Nolan's wonderful \\"Batman Begins\\", which explains Bruce Wayne's childhood, his quest for answers, his training to become a crime fighter, and his discovery of the tools that would make him into Batman in perfect detail.  The movie is darker than the Joel Schumacher Batman films were, undoubtedly, but a different type of dark than the Tim Burton films.  Instead of being gothic, the film is now a gritty, stylish noire, complete with sneering mob boss and corrupt cops.  Gotham City now resembles contemporary Chicago.    The cast is perfect.  Christian Bale is the best actor to step into the role of Batman so far.  His Bruce Wayne is believable and human, and his transition into the altar ego Batman is almost seamless, though he has a tendency to gargle a bit too much when slipping into his menacing \\"Bat voice.\\"  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman bring much needed comic relief as butler Alfred and gadget-master Lucius Fox, respectively.  Michael Caine brings back fond memories of that OTHER Michael from the previous Bat-films.  Katie Holmes, like Kim Bassinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Nicole Kidman before her, is talented and absolutely stunning.  Unfortunately, her character is given precious little to do.    The true stars of the Batman films have always been the villains, though, and \\"Batman Begins\\" is no exception.  Cillian Murphy may not have the star power of Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, or Jim Carrey, but he delivers the stand-out performance of the movie, playing psychotic psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane.  It helps that Murphy auditioned for Bruce Wayne.  He's perfect as the hero's doppelganger, ranging from charming to oily to completely deranged.  As the villainous Scarecrow, he makes a simple burlap sack creepier than should be possible.  Liam Neeson, whose bold, commanding voice is second only to James Earl Jones', plays a character in the gray area between hero and villain.      There are a couple of drawbacks to the film, though.  First off, Nolan makes the action sequences too artistic for his own good.  The fights are montages of extreme close-ups and quick cuts.  Sure, it captures the mystique of the Dark Knight, but it's not so fun to watch.    My second complaint is the same that I had with Tim Burton's first Batman film.  In the comics, Bruce is forever motivated by the unsolved murder of his parents.  In both films, the murder of the parents is solved.  This time the killer of Bruce's parents is caught and killed before Bruce even becomes Batman.  As a result, Bruce's motivation to become Batman takes longer to explain than absolutely necessary.    Those minor quibbles aside, \\"Batman Begins\\" is the most human, and most entertaining, Batman movie so far.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I was never really a fan of Johnny Cash but growing up in the 60's i heard his songs like everyone else.  His life had no influence on me at all.  I actually didn't care if i saw this picture but my partner heard that it was good.  So with no expectations we went to see it.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.  Everything from story line, costumes, music, set design, acting it was Hollywood first class all the way.  I have never been a fan of Reese Witherspoon either but today i can't speak more highly of her acting.  Joaquin Phoenix sorry to say i never heard of but again this \\"was\\" Johnny Cash.  The talents of Reese and Joaquin own singing voice on this film was that of a Broadway show.   <br /> <br />Not that i'm a Broadway snob but i've worked most of my life on the stage, from Radio City to Broadway to having my own live theatre.  I can be extremely ciritical but this film i give \\"Thumbs Up.\\"  It just doesn't get any better than this and will be looking forward to the DVD when it comes out.  Great job done by everyone.

0553801503|5.0|George R. R. Martin's \\"A Feast For Crows\\" is a book most of his fans waited years to buy.  Martin's fourth book in his \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" series was so long--and so in demand--that he cut it in half.  The fans received what was, for many of us, a taste of things to come in Westeros.  And oh, dear Lord, what a taste.<br /><br />\\"A Feast For Crows\\" has been criticized for offering the viewpoints of \\"minor\\" characters.  I beg to differ--the characters featured in \\"Feast\\" are characters the story cannot do without.  Cersei Lannister, the Queen Dowager at King's Landing, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime Lannister (the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and Cersei's brother), and Samwell Tarly of the Night's Watch may not be protagonists per se.  But they are utterly necessary to the story, especially as each one travels a dangerous road in the aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater, the Red Wedding, and King Joffrey's death.<br /><br />Of course we miss Jon Snow and Daenerys, but their presence is felt throughout.  Cersei spends her time in \\"Feast\\" careening from one blunder to the next, and a prophecy that haunts her could very well point to Daenerys.  Likewise, Jon Snow's machinations to deny Melisandre a victim sends Sam Tarly, the self-professed coward of the Night's Watch, over the sea with Gilly, the wildling Craster's daughter, and Master Aemon, who has an epiphany that should satisfy fans who've been looking for that sort of confirmation.<br /><br />Sansa Stark also appears in \\"Feast,\\" and her role here is echoed by her sister Arya's sojourn in Braavos.  While Sansa learns wiles encouraged by Petyr Littlefinger, whose attentions are as unsettling as a father with incestuous intent, Arya learns and practices deadlier arts.  And Brienne Tarth, carrying the sword Oathkeeper, travels through bandit-infested countryside seeking them both, and encounters instead a horror she never thought to see.<br /><br />Martin throws in more issues in \\"Feast,\\" such as the Sparrows, a military religious group that made me nervous for the fate of Westeros.  Is the civil war about to become a holy war as well?  Likewise, Cersei takes on the young queen Margaery Tyrell and ends up sharing a fate she intended for her hated rival, which shoves the Lannister faction a little closer to the cliff's edge.  With the realm dangerously unstable, and the Greyjoys sailing to raid the coasts, the weather steps in as the final player in the game.<br /><br />\\"A Feast For Crows\\" will have the rest of its story told in \\"A Dance of Dragons,\\" and Martin plans to have seven books written instead of six.  With everything that the title of Number Five promises, I can't wait to see it--although, thankfully, Martin has promised that it shouldn't be so long a wait this time.s, a military religious group that made me nervous for the fate of Westeros.

B000BRBA8S|5.0|Wong Kar-wai is one of the finest filmmakers in the world; an artist of singular vision and remarkable range. 2046 is probably his biggest project to date, but his eye remains firmly focussed on the spectrum of human emotion and behaviour.  It would be redundant to attempt to encapsulate some form of plot outline (on the surface of things, Tony Leung reprises his character from the majestic IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, contemplating his many varied encounters with women in the past, present and even future, all the while longing for Maggie Cheung - his on-screen partner in the previous film - who remains the love of his life). <br /> <br />Suffice to say, narrative is not the point - Wong's films are about pure experience; creating mood and atmosphere to lose yourself in.  If you can tune in to his wavelength, the effect is rapturous. <br /> <br />The transfer on the new DVD is very fine, and is complemented by an impressive array of feautures which do a good job of conveying Wong's complex approach to his craft.
B00000DS0B|2.0|I can say I was looking forward to hearing this album. I'm only 13, so because of all the crappy music that We're stuck with today (Emo, Rap, Pop, etc.), I've had to go back and listen to the great rock artists of yesteryear. Ozzy Osbourne is personally one of my favorite singers, very unique. I loved Ozzy's first two albums....but I can't say the same for \\"Bark At The Moon\\". <br /> <br />Bark At The Moon, 9/10 - A solid album opener. Not much to be said about this song, it's pretty much all around good. Enjoy the four minutes and seventeen seconds while they last. <br /> <br />Your No Different, 2/10 - Oh dear God what is this abomination? Everything about this is God aweful. Synthesizer overkill. When you can hear guitar it sounds terrible. For some reason Ozzy's voice started to get me really angry while I was listening to this. A total miss. <br /> <br />Now You See It (Now You Don't), 4/10 - Egh...not much better...At least we can hear the guitar in this one, but Ozzy sounds absolutely f*ckin terrible, his voice completely killed this for me. Then again, I would have maybe given it a 5 or 6 if it hadn't. <br /> <br />Rock 'N' Roll Rebel, 5/10 - Will the torment ever end? Yes, the guitar is solid, but again Ozzy's voice kills the whole song. <br /> <br />Centre Of Eternity, 8/10 - The torment ended (at least for now)! This is a good song, no doubt about that. The guitar picks up the pace a little, Ozzy sounds a little better. It's just pretty good though, nothing too special. <br /> <br />So Tired, 1/10 - What the hell is this!? <br /> <br />Slow Down, 7/10 - This is at least half decent. A little poppish-er (I made that up), but it's still okay, better than most of the crap on this album. <br /> <br />Wating For Darkness,5/10 - What is this song even about? It's not good, again with the synthesizer overkill. <br /> <br />Spiders In The Light, -3/10 - I just gave that song a negative grade. Does that not tell you how much it blows? <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a piece of crap. It has three good songs, two which aren't all that great. I think part of how bad this album is, is due to the absence of Randy. Mr.Rhoades co-wrote the songs with Ozzy, and I think songwriting was a major factor in the failure of this album. If you want a good Ozzy Osbourne album, I recommend \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\", but you probably already have those. If you want to get into Ozzy Osbourne, this most definitely is not the place to start, that would be \\"Blizzard\\". I found it very strange how Ozzy's voice killed so many of the songs. I've never had a problem with Ozzy's voice (with the exception of the time he sang at the U.K Music Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, that I do have a problem with). I only parted with two dollars for this, and I guess I got what I paid for.

Adding some instructions would help a long ways to showing a person how he got to each image. But all in all, it's very helpful.<br /><br />Mike Sexton,<br /><br />Owner, Birdman's Designs
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is pure film noir. For those of you out there, struggling to find comfort in modern movies; you're barking up the wrong tree. This movie has all the things you would want from a black and white movie. Yes, the movie is shot entirely in black and white with a few collors here and there that often peirce through the screen. Blue eyes that catch. That red dress that needs to be blood red. Hair that looks like gold. Speaking of gold . . . this movie is 100% gold. It is the first movie you should buy right when you come out of someone's womb. Start your movie collection the right way with this piece of m ovie history. The characters are facinating and incredibly rich with film noir qualities. The anithero, the bully, the old cop, the corrupt ones, and the hookers that tie it all together. Watching this movie will never get old. It is absoluetly timeless. And if there is one person who doesn't like this movie . . . well, let's just say that he's got a lot to learn about film noir.
0393324818|4.0|I think Mr. Lewis' great writing style makes this book more enjoyable than the subject matter really is.  First of all, statistically speaking, while the A's production during the regular season is impressive, equally as impressive has been their record of post-season futility.    The antagonist of this book, A's GM Billy Beane, comes across as a boorish, loud-mouthed, idiot.  Of course, we all experience idiots in life everyday, but Mr. Beane wants everyone to know that he's a genius and all the rest of us are the uninformed (sounds like the Democratic Party...It takes a Village?).    Hardly.  Mr. Beane and some others (Theo Esptein of the Red Sox) in baseball subscribe to a unique set of baseball stats to make the bulk of their baseball decisions.  Most importantly, these include on-base and slugging percentage.  Moreover, they view previously used stats as being completely irrelevant.  Now, anyone that has taken a college-level stats course will tell you that most stats can be tailored to someone's own views or goals.  This is the backbone of Moneyball.    Armed with this knowledge and arrogance, Beane and his crew of sycophants seek to change to rules of baseball by awarding lesser known players with stats to their liking while eschewing the higher priced talent that Beane views as being overpaid (spare me please the endless comparisons of teachers, police officers, etc.  It's called a free market and if people are willing to shell out $5 for a bear and support poor management, don't blame the players) and underproductive.  For several years, this has worked for the A's.  However, year after year, the playoffs were not kind to the budget conscious A's.    I'll save deep analysis of the A's/stats geeks tenure to better baseball minds, but a cursory review shows a disturbing pattern in their thinking.  Yes, of course, many A's players were seeking outsized contracts after seemingly being underpaid based on current market rates, but losing Jason Giambi and AlfonsoSoriano (sp?) and replacing them with unknowns isn't always good for the team, fans, baseball and the player.  Giambi, of course, had a rapid dropoff following his trip to the Yankees, but did come back to have a great year in 05.  Soriano is desperate to leave the hell that is life with the trial-lawyer Peter Angelos' horrific, committed to losing Baltimore Orioles.      The question is, isn't there a happy medium?   Of cousre, not all contracts pay off (A-Rod's Rangers deal), but Beane and the A's take an approach to loyal players that teeters on the verge of being negligent.      Beane comes across as a profoundly arrogant moron who belittles, yells, and pouts like a giant child.  None of his crew seems to either mind or be willing to tell Beane to check himself.  To his great credit (or ignorance), Mr. Lewis tells us that Mr. Beane did nothing to counter that image in his book.  You can't read this book without thinking that you are glad you don't have to work with Beane.    I don't ask much of books, movie, and tv.  Just entertain or inform me.  I did learn quite a bit about the Beane-Epstein approach to baseball, but I also learned about the other side of the player disloyalty arguement. Fans always whine about players leaving for other teams, but they sometimes don't take into account the team's approach to negotiations (Ex. the Red Sox made it clear they were not going to give a big contract to Johnny Damon).      This book provides a unique look at these behind the scences decisions.
0307276902|4.0|Well written - gripping - - riveting - - I can't get into the controversy.  I believe the changes that were intentional were minor and the facts that checked out as very different from Frey's recollection can certainly be attributed to his state of withdrawal, which, as we all know, would certainly skew perceptions/recollections.  All that aside, the book is one that will stick to your ribs and stay with you forever - - rare in today's commercial publishing world.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased this DVD set after renting the movie Serenity.  I loved the movie Serenity, but I never saw the show Firefly so I bought it to watch.  I figured it would be pretty good, but I had no idea how addicting it would actually be.  It is my new favorite show.  I can't believe FOX canceled this series.  I recommend this box set to anyone
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I am so impressed with the music on this soundtrack.  It has quickly become my favorite album.  It is on heavy rotation in my car.  The music selection makes me want to search for more Steve Earle and Linda Ronstant.  I love the lay out of the songs.  I especially love Emmylou Harris' A Love That Will Never Grow Old.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka touches on both aspects of life, the dreadful and the wonderful. It was simply fascinating, a one of a kind experience that reached for my attention. This film speaks volumes without any words, except my own words running through the back of my mind trying to comprehend what the creator intended to convey. I many not have gotten it, but me and my three year old now have an interesting view on the world.  <br /> <br />...Ron Fricke brings to us what an observer from outside the atmosphere might see of life on earth... <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We loved every minute of this series and we could not believe it got cancelled.  If it had got the advertising it deserved it could have been great!  Hopefully they will continue the series...scifi has picked up the rights and hopefully they will continue to make these.  It is a western sci fi with the feel of star wars and and old western.  Fun and entertaining.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I loved it when I saw it the first time, but I was caught up in the story then.  With a second viewing I appreciated the brilliance of the achievement even more.  The Writing, the Acting, the Directing, the Cinematography.  See it again.  You'll love it even more. I hope it wins every award it is nominated for.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|The second season of the original Star Trek is the best. My favorite from this season is \\"mirror,mirror\\" There are a few that aren't very good, however, like \\"assignment:earth\\" which was intended as a pilot for a series that didn't get produced. However, there are more great episodes than bad in this season.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This DVD provides some welcome relief to the thousands of fans who were unable to attend these comeback gigs. The concert does not disappoint and the quality of this double DVD is superb. <br /> <br />It's a great set - every song is a classic and the musicianship is simply fantastic. When playing, Bruce, Baker and Clapton seem to enjoy a telepathic connection at times. Bruce and Baker may look old, but they sure deliver the goods - bigtime! It's amazing to learn that some of the songs had never been played by Cream in concert previously (e.g. Badge). All 3 musicians give good, interesting interviews and there are alternate takes of some of the songs. <br /> <br />Highlights: N.S.U., Rollin' and Tumblin', We're Going Wrong, Toad, and Stormy Monday (where Clapton's playing is just breathtaking - I don't remember him playing that well for years - resulting in a well-deserved standing ovation from an Albert Hall that is packed to the rafters). It is also fun to spot the celebrities in the audience over the various nights. I'm not going to reveal who they are - buy the DVD and find out for yourself.  <br />
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult has written a hard to forget book.  Well developed characters, with a unique writing style. The plot has been well outlined in other reviews.  However, the ending, in my opinion, was very disappointing!  I love this book, but have been haunted by how it could have ended. In the end notes Ms Picoult  herself questioned her ending. I've no doubt this will be a movie.  Perhaps a movie will not use this ending to dodge the important questions My Sister's Keeper raises.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This is a wonderful film about a fascinating pair of Mexican artists. I knew nothing about either until I saw this film It is a visual and musical treat - more than that - an exceptional cinematic experience. Salma Hayek gives the performance of her life, but the whole cast is perfect. This is a must buy movie which serves to broaden ones interest in art and music. Frida was an amazing and passionate woman and this movie is a visually seductive account of her life.
0375703764|4.0|You know when you read a book and say, \\"hey, this would be an awesome movie,\\" even though you have no idea how it would translate? House of Leaves redefines that inclination, proving that some stories just need to be left on the page where the author can drag you, kicking and screaming, through the depths and annals of his imagination, at his own brutally slow or breakneck pace. HOL is a four-course literary meal served by Hitchcock, David Foster Wallace, and the Blair Witch. One part academic study, one part fast-and-loose first person narrative, and one part horror story, House of Leaves is far and away the most complex and terrifying book I've ever loved.

B0002RQ2T4|2.0|Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way. <br /> <br />There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted. <br /> <br />The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's. <br /> <br />The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is. <br /> <br />In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|There really is a Michael Alig and he really is doing time for beating his boyfriend's brains out with a hammer and then, just for good measure, injecting Drano into his veins. (Note that the folks at Drano claim it won't hurt your pipes but say nothing about your circulatory system.)<br /><br />Though this nightmarish tale is based on a true story, the thrust of it is a surreal view of human emptiness and superficiality, a point most reviewers seem to miss. The Andy Warhol \\"Factory\\" set the stage for manufactured people who looked like they might be interesting but were in fact fabricated non-entities, ciphers. That was Warhol's genius, making nothing look like something. The wave of club kids depicted in this movie are just the next generation of thoroughly empty thrill-seekers, gripping onto instant pleasure and making sure to stay one step ahead of fashion. That there is no character insight IS the character insight, that is the point of these little monsters. They are the most extreme manifestation of our hedonism and shallowness.<br /><br />All of this is revealed by Macaulay Culkin as Alig, who gives a performance that is heroic, fearless, mesmerizing, and chilling all at once. Culkin inhabits Alig, which must have been haunting and sad. He plays Alig as a staggeringly insecure hayseed whose determination to get \\"inside\\" is awe-inspiring. Once inside, he becomes grandiose, cruel, and mad, peddling ever faster to maintain the manic illusion of happiness. Culkin's performance could not have soared so high without Seth Green next to him. Green, first in the role of mentor, presents a scaled down version of the same obsession with superficiality, but, amusingly, seems to know it. Increasingly bitter because of Alig's ascent, he nonetheless maintains a certain amount of concern. This is the closest you will come to a human emotion in the film.<br /><br />On its face one would say that this movie had nothing going for it. The people are repulsive, one must contain one's glee when they self-destruct. The protagonist has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The side of society it illuminates is miserably sad and important only to the extent that it illustrates the illnesses of society at large. And yet, with all that, it is spellbinding viewing. Certainly Culkin's powerhouse performance explains some of it, maybe the rest is attributable to our sheer amazement that such people exist. Be warned, you'll need a strong stomach for this, we're talking Drano, not Pepto.f-destruct. The protagonist has absolutely no redeeming qualities.

B000E0WJIC|5.0|The EP was great, but I could not wait until this cd dropped. It is everything I expected it to be and then some. I hate alot of the \\"emo-core\\" stuff that is out there today but this is flat out the most amazing emo-core record I have ever heard. The musicianship displayed within this album is so good that it really takes you back to the so-called good ol' days of heavy music. The guitarist's solos are as blistering as I have heard recently in heavy music. The vocals are clean and the whole band just blends together really well. Don't hate on these guys before you hear them because they are the future of this industry and should finish taking metal to the top of the world where it belongs. Down with crappy rap music, let's put real music back where it belongs people. Start with buying this record because it is amazing.
B00006AW2M|5.0|The Beatles were Hertz, the Stones were Avis, it must have been tough. When Sgt. Pepper was released, setting the bar ridiculously high, the Stones surely felt the heat. (McCartney reported being astounded that Hendrix could play the entire album perfectly two days after its release. Zappa offered We're Only In It For The Money, a superb homage pointedly debunking the pop culture of the day.) The Stones responded with TSMR.<br /><br />TSMR is certainly a flawed album, but it has more great songs than most - Sing This All Together, Citadel, She's A Rainbow, 2,000 Man. The Lantern is basic Stones fare while Gomper has the obligatory \\"visit to India\\" sound that was de rigueur at the time. Most fun of all are the atmospherics, long jams, spacey sound effects, and yes, even Brian Jones snoring.<br /><br />As a kid coming up I was a rabid Stones fan, always preferring their bad boy appeal to the mop-top, perky Beatles. But the one knock on the Stones, and it's a big one, is that they've spent the past forty years imitating themselves. With all the financial resources in the world, they seem to be completely unwilling to take any kind of creative risks at all. This is more than an indictment of their artistry; it's a clear demonstration of laziness and cowardice.<br /><br />TSMR is the only Stones album that is a complete departure from their standard, winning formula for success - rehash a selection by some unknown Delta blues man, put an English accent on it, crank up the Marshalls, and slap on tight slacks. Nobody does it like the Stones, but it's hardly original. That the only truly daring and risky album they ever did was merely a response to a better album by a group that routinely took creative chances, does say rather a lot about the Stones. \\"Open our heads and the pictures come.\\"
B00007KWHN|5.0|No need for a lengthy review. Suffice it to say that this CD is a must own. This is the first Yes album where they have found their trademark sound and the rest is history.  The remastered version has great sound and a few bonus tracks with shorter, single versions of \\"your move\\" from \\"I've seen all good people\\" and \\"Starship Trooper\\" and a studio version of \\"Clap\\"
B00005JN0T|3.0|As everyone loves to point out, this isn't Isaac Asimov.  It actually feels like a blend between BLADE RUNNER (without that classic's bleak and wonderful design) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (the computers and robots come to the same conclusions that sent the Hal 9000 into its homicidal mode).<br /><br />The special effects are really good and the action works.  I was also really thankful that Will Smith plays a character that leaves out all the macho/ethnic posturing I've come to expect from a studio film.<br /><br />Much better than I expected.
B00005AXEL|3.0|i love stevie nicks and her music..i own all of the fleetwood mac albums that stevie nicks is a part of.  this is easily my least favorite stevie nicks solo album to date.  the songs are not bad.....it's just that her vocal range is the weakest that i've heard it on any of her prior albums.  even street angel had much stronger vocals than this album has.  this is not a terrible cd to listen to, it's just not that moving or powerful as her previous ones.....i'm really looking forward to her next cd which will hopefully include much stronger,powerful and meaningful vocals than this one has....:-)
0684824906|5.0|Abraham Lincoln as the \\"Effective Executive\\" could be the subtitle of Team of Rivals. Doris Kearns Goodwin pays homage to a man who was perhaps the ultimate \\"people person\\" yet a leader with a will of steel. Lincoln was able to put aside past slights, humiliations, and even back-stabbing to put the best people in positions and develop effective and close personal relationships. Lincoln kept his eye on the ball (winning the Civil War) and did not let himself get diverted by petty or even not so petty squabbling. For cabinet members such as Seward and Stanton he provided support when needed even at his own expense instead of giving in to political extremists. In the case of Chase, Lincoln put up with behind the scenes, but obvious undermining, because the job Chase did at Secretary of the Treasury was exemplary. Any other President would have dumped Chase soon in his administration. Team of Rivals is more than a biography of Lincoln. Besides tracing Lincoln's career, it also tells the story of the four major members of his cabinet; Seward, Bates, Stanton, and Chase. The readers gain an excellent background of the period and also the understanding that these four and Lincoln were rivals. That Lincoln turned this group of very capable men with strong egos into an effective \\"Team of Rivals\\" is testimony of his greatness. Lincoln was very fortunate that all of them, despite their own aspirations and disappointment (with the exception of Stanton) at not reaching the Presidency, rose to the occasion and served the nation well in a critical and dangerous time. Or perhaps it was Lincoln's sense of character and ability in others that caused him to put such men in their positions. Each of them initially believed himself superior to Lincoln and thought his nomination and election to the Presidency (again with the exception of Stanton) was an undeserved fluke at his own expense. Starting with Seward who possibly became Lincoln's best friend, all except for Chase came around to a level of the highest respect and admiration summed up by Stanton's remark shortly after Lincoln's death  of \\"now he belongs to the ages,\\" The quotes of admiration are numerous throughout \\"Team of Rivals\\" and this points to the major weakness of the book. Goodwin pays homage to Lincoln and virtually confers secular sainthood. Anybody looking for a critical analysis of Abraham Lincoln will likely be frustrated and should look elsewhere. However, Goodwin is brilliantly successful at what she set out to do and \\"Team of Rivals\\" should have a place on the short list of \\"must reads\\" in American history for many years to come.level of the highest respect and admiration summed up by Stanton's remark shortly after Lincoln's death  of \\"now he belongs to the ages,\\" The quotes of admiration are numerous throughout \\"Team of Rivals\\" and this points to the major weakness of the book.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Simply put this is, in my opinion, one of the best \\"Live\\" shows ever made. It captures the band at the partying peak of their careers playing just about all of their best songs. It is even better now that it has been re-done again and the entire drum solo is now available to be heard like on the record years ago. Now if only as one reviewer said they would also include the \\"Introduction\\" at the begining it would be perfect. If it had to be turned into a double CD that's fine. Then if there were any more songs from the concert that was omitted to begin with they could also include them (Like on CSNY's \\"Four Way Street\\"). I don't know how anybody could give this a negative review. You can practically feel the energy pouring from the band onstage. Turn it up and enjoy!
0553573403|1.0|This book is greatly overrated. Poorly written, using sex and sadism as space fillers under the guise of characterization, it thrives on unnecesary shock value.<br /><br />The plot is unoriginal on the large scale-I'm fairly certain I can see the end results, after all the bloodshed ends. That in itself is alright- I've been reading fantasy since I was 9, I'm used to a degree of predictability. I think the details of the plot had some potential to be interestingly done, and the world has good aspects to it. This is hard to pay attention to though-the writing and the sickening discriptions drown it out.<br /><br />It is enough for a character to discover the queen is sleeping with her brother- that's depraved, but that's the point. I can stand the fact that these characters are supposed to be bad. I think it would add to the story to not have the descriptions of it, or of the whoring habits of the other characters. The same goes for violence; it is enough to know that a character died terribly without telling us every last modicum about their pain and how the villian did it. It would certainly shorten the book some, and it could use it. Sure, call me a wuss- doesn't change that it's unnecessary, and it's FLUFF.<br /><br />The potential of this series to be an alright fantasy series has been smothered, and it's a pity. I can't imagine why anyone would ever put this as a \\"classic,\\" but that's true about most classics, I suppose.
B0000CNY27|5.0|In 1988, the U.S. turned Manhattan, New York into a maximum security prison where the most brutal criminals are residing for life, due to the 400% rise in crime rates. There's no way for them to escape, as the bridges are filled with mines, a large wall is built around the shoreline, and a police force army is based there to take out any attempted escapees. In 1997, Air Force One is hijacked, so the president escapes in a pod, landing in Manhattan. Ex-special forces war hero/bank robber Snake Plissken is offered his freedom if he can rescue the president, who was on his way to a Hartford Summit meeting as well as a cassette tape (CDs weren't around in 1981) that contains important information regarding Nuclear Fission within 24 hours. Just to make sure he goes through the mission, Snake has been implanted with two microscopic capsules that will explode within 24 hours, meaning that he'll be dead if he's a little late.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|Everytime I see a commercial for RENT, I get the song \\"Everybody Has AIDS\\" from the RENT spoof in TEAM AMERICA stuck in my head.  Anybody else?<br /><br />I really hate the characters in this movie.  Was there anything heroic about being a junkie or gay with AIDS in the 80's?  As the late Sam Kinison used to say, \\"It's not like these people were ever treated like war heroes before--GOD BLESS YOU, SON!  KEEP AT IT!\\"<br /><br />So watching diseased, drug-ravaged squatters so proudly sing their anthems at annoyed working folks is hardly the life-changing affirmation I read in the rave reviews.  They should've called this movie RANT.
