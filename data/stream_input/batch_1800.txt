B008CJ8S0A|4.0|I had never heard about Trifonov until he played in a nearby city. I like his playing style, he has great clarity and is not rushed. The cadenzas, for example, are splendid. Contrary to many young competition winners, he does not solely rely on virtuosity to impress his audience, although his technique is certainly not lacking. This recording is very good, although I have to admit I still prefer Argerich's version (also a Chopin competition winner by the way). He only gets 4 stars because he is young and I believe he can do an even better recording in the future. A talent to watch...
B007N8RULO|4.0|The ads are intrusive. Small ads at the top or bottom of the page would be much better. That being said, the game plays very nicely on my tablet, but there are many good aps that have spider and multiple other solitaire games to choose from.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I never get tired of the feel good comedy this show has. Thanks to the tireless work of the writers, producers and actors this show will live on in clult cinema for a long time to come.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is the best of the best! its up grades are cool, but I dunno what the golden vehicles do, but still get this game!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Even though I did't get the exact model I ordered, the one that I got it's very similar and works perfectly. I converted the only audio output of my plasma TV to analog using this device and it works as advertised.<br /><br />The big plus is that it uses the TV USB port to get power.<br /><br />Very recommended.
B003738CJS|5.0|Have always liked this movie. The movie came on time. Usually items arrive on the later end of the range they give so make sure you order early enough. :-)
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Cute movie that all ages can watch together and enjoy.  Loved the animation & the storyline was great to get you into the perfect mood for the holidays!!
B002DMJLTE|5.0|I had never seen this movie and my boyfriend said it was good, so we had been lookin g for it in stores without results. So we ordered it. It came on time, but at the later end of the range they give so make sure you order it in plenty of time. :-)
B008B68IV8|5.0|I love Ghoulia just in general!! Her per Owl rocks and she's a zombie kid- it doesn't get better than that!! She's smart and funny even though she doesn't say much-lol.  I was fortunate enough to find the basic Ghoulia in a bookstore along with the basic Frankie and picked them both up!! I like Ghoulia in every line put out!! She just looks fun in the Travel/Scaris line so I'm glad I got her!!  Even though the prices are average here in Amazon, you should also check your local Bullseye store because I just found that they are carrying the Scaris line and I just found a Skelitas so definetely don't pay overprice for these beauties!!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We love this movie! Had been looking for it for a while in stored to have for Christmas and couldn't find it. Found it here for about ten dollars. Good deal for a great movie. :-)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|my brothers love playing this game and I do Tobit is coool to me and them it is okay .
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I specifically bought it because I love their version of &#34;Carol of the Bells.&#34; I wanted to hear the rest of their music. I wasn't disappointed. And it's inexpensive! A bargain for the talent. I really expected it to cost more!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As I was browsing the books available, I keep seeing this book and I knew that I had to buy it. A few years ago, during a gall bladder operation, I let go of everything. I have been a very spiritual person for many years and I willed myself to the other side. I could not explain the feeling that I felt. Dr Alexander's book does exactly that. Thanks for sharing your own experience with the world, Dr Alexander!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the book and was compelled to finish it. Great twist of events! The characters felt superficial and plastic, which I guess is the point of the book. Some people are not who they appear to be. Read it fast. It's not one of those books you don't want to see end. You might actually be glad it's over. Modern day superficial twister!
B0093H8HXS|4.0|So far so good. No problems as of now. The thermal compound that was included on the cpu fan was eh.
B004LROMX4|3.0|I'm a big sci-if fan but want it to make sense.  This series tries - but there are leaps of logic that simply don't make sense and the acting, to me, is often overdone.  Having Wylie's character continually relate things to history becomes tired.  It's as though the series creators can't decide what they want the show to be - melodrama, sci-if or comedy.  I like the premise however and will continue to watch, hoping it becomes better.  I would recommend watching to see if you enjoy it, but would not recommend purchasing until you're sure.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I waited and wanted this movie to be awesome.  It fell so flat.  The plot was more hole filled than 10 swiss cheeses.  It bordered at times ona spoof and seemed cut to shreds.  Fassbender is awesome and lends a lot of presence to what ends up being a kind of teen envinment studies nightmare.  The hard scifi grit is repalced with an almost liberal arts science expedition attitude mixed with oh my gosh evil corporate plot that never materializes.  The deus ex machinas motivations are murky at best and the audience is just supposed to accept all the coincidentaly, unlikely, sappy bs thrown at it without a lick of respect as to the intelligent viewer.  If they had spent a little more time writing th eplot, and slightly less on marketing everyone would have been happier.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|If you enjoyed and chuckled through the first Hangover, chances are you will find this one just as hilarious.  Much of the same humor but in a different country - Thailand.  The cast creates the wonderful and extremely funny (and crude) chemistry that made the first Hangover so funny.  If potty humor and crudeness aren't your cup of tea - you probably hated the first Hangover.  If you like a belly laugh with a couple new variations on the same type of theme, you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />My partner and I really enjoyed both of the Hangover movies and are looking forward to Hangover III.  The chemistry between the cast is a lot of fun.  It's good to know what you are getting yourself into when you watch these.  Nothing deep or serious. Crude and funny is more like it.
B000SSPL0I|5.0|Renata Tebaldi is magnificent here. One of the most beautiful expressive voices I've ever heard in any opera. The rest of the cast including conductor and orchestra are also wonderful,especially Fernando Corena as Fra Melitone and Giulietta Simionato's Preziosilla. They are a hoot. The only problem for me is Del Monaco's lack of subtlety. His Alvaro is one dimensional full throttle loud gotta catch a train volume for the first 3 acts and doesn't acquire any nuance or subtlety until Act 4. He's outstanding there. Since he is a main character, this can be occasionally grating. But by no means should this be a deal breaker.<br />This would be the unconditional top of the heap Destino if you could transpose Carlo Bergonzi from Gardelli's set.<br />Where he is the best Alvaro I've heard.. Golden tenor and expressive many faceted vocal actor in his prime..<br />Ah, but it is what it is.. IMHO..<br />Still, would be difficult to top this overall performance and the SUPERB 96/24bit remastering of this 1955 stereo recording.Libretto included.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00782O7IY|5.0|In the day of the silent film, people had little exposure to film and, let's face it, many had little exposure to other people. Back then, you couldn't be sure how much the audience could read the body language of others, understand their facial expressions, figure out what a character was feeling based on events so far. So during the silent film era, actors had to over emote and so much more of the dialogue had to be read.<br /><br />Nowadays we have exposure to so much what with movies, TV, life experiences (we're exposed to more people and more situations, and we have a better understanding of other people).  Watching this movie, I appreciated how a modern audience had so little need for dialogue. We could tell from facial expressions and body language what was being said/thought. There was no need for the characters to over act to get their points across.<br /><br />This is what I appreciated most about the move: its minimalism. I'll bet there was 75% less reading and less character lip movement in this movie than there would have been 90 years ago. Modern writers can take for granted that we sometimes read lips and only require a simple expression from the character to understand what is happening.<br /><br />From this standpoint, I really enjoyed this film.<br /><br />I loved the scene of the dancer seducing the actor's coat.<br /><br />And I loved the end.
B000274THQ|4.0|This film accurately portrays life just before and after the Berlin wall in 1989.  It does not offer a complicated plot but is well  worth a view.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I'm not going to give you any storyline, you need to take the ride for yourself.  I will warn you, and wish I'd been warned, that if you read Shadow of the Wind when it first came out, it would be a very good idea to reread it either before or right after you plan on reading this one. This story stands alone well, however, if you're a fan of the Cemetary of Forgotten Books, you would benefit from rereading it in conjunction with the reading of this new one.  I didn't feel the same way about Angel's Game, however, by the time the expected fourth book in the group is released, I'll probably have reread both.  Since Shadow of the Wind is one of the few books I would pack for a 3 hour cruise with The Skipper, I don't object to having a reason to refresh Daniel's story in my mind.<br /><br />The story moves quickly and the prose and poetry of Zafon's writing makes the darker side of this time in Spanish hisory still something you were glad you read.
0385344228|5.0|The book is incredibly suspenseful, a page turner. It ends with a mind boggling twist. It's written in first person which is hard to do well but the author did a fantastic job, the writing is superb. I highly recommend Defending Jacob.
030758836X|1.0|Although the story has a common premise, Flynn approaches it with a well-developed twist. Unfortunately her delivery is so crass, the characters so sadly wrought, the last few chapters so contrived, the readers experience is a struggle to the finish. I feel sorry for Flynn's son who she says will be old enough to read it in 2024!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is not only informative but it is also a very interesting and exciting sort of reading, due to the way the story unfolds and how he managed to intertwine what the book is essentially about with facts that happened throughout his entire life. I would definetely recommend it to those interested in knowing more about the beauty of life when seen through aspects that make it a whole lot more meaningful than it already is.
1423140605|3.0|This book was exhausting to read. I think I'm growing weary of the Riordan formula. His books are so full of action that, after a while, I end up tuning out; all of his characters have the same personality, I have trouble telling them apart aside from their physical characterstics (kinda like the Power Rangers after they've suited up; the only way I can tell them apart is by the color of their costumes); and thank goodness for gullible gods and monsters. The heroes constantly dupe them so easily that they don't even seem like much of a threat.<br /><br />They're are just too many characters, who all seem like the same character, that I can't bother to care about all of them. I've never read any of Riordan's books more than once, and I finally figured out why. They're too similar to each other, and way too exhausting. Aside from the surprise ending, I can barely remember anything I read in \\"The Mark of Athena.\\" It's a good book worthy of a read, but a re-read? Not for a long time.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Great and heart touching, this is the type of movie almost anyone can relate to in some way or another.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I was shocked how bad this was. All of Christopher Nolan's films are so carefully constructed, but this so sloppy. It was incoherent and didn't make much sense, with plot holes you drive a truck through. And you have a 2:45 Batman movie when Batman is on screen maybe 30 minutes, and half of that getting his butt kicked. And that ridiculous dubbing of Bane's voice. You couldn't understand him half the time. I kept waiting for the film to be over.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Read about 25% of this book, went to return for a refund and was unable to. I paid $10 for this so I am not amused.<br /><br />The writing style was interesting and I thought this might be a great book, but a few chapters in the story started to drag. I could not seem to care for the characters, and the subject matter and language became too rated R for my taste. I should have read more of the negative reviews before making this purchase.<br /><br />For those who would want to know, in the first quarter of the book you deal with swearing, teen partying, and a gay teen relationship. Further research shows there is a lot more to come if you read further.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The first few minutes of this movie are what grab you and the rest just keeps adding to the messages given out
B001NZMWPM|4.0|The MP3 quality of this record is of decent quality. I love me some Scorpions and this record takes me back to my high school days. The tune Arizona takes me back to a school trip that &#34;really was a gas, mind blowing all the way you know - just out of sight.&#34;
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this was a very good book. I liked that there was a little bit of romance among all of the fighting.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|This  novel didn't have as much action as most of Child's others but I still enjoyed the book.<br />Though some of the story line was a little far fetched most of the plot was believable.

B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I have the spiral version of this atlas and have found it to be quite handy.  I looked forward to having it available on my iPad as well.  The description says that it will work with the iPad.  Wrong.  It does not.  I've attempted to get some customer support for this issue.  So far no luck.  Stick with the spiral version.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Innocent enough to be likeable.  Entertaining enough to keep me seated for a few hours.  Characters were well thought out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Recommend all of his books to readers, especially if your child is not a very strong reader or has a learning disability. Because these books are hilarious and made mine want to read them all, very funny! I guess I would recommend them for 3rd grade and up.
B000VWYJ8Q|3.0|Why did Bourne tell the section chief (Noah, I think his name was) that he was in his office robbing him?  Though the end could have been the same (they tracked Bourne to the alternate address based on information independently derived), it wouldn't have required the New York car chase.  In my opinion, the movie would have been better without it.  On its own, this movie deserves two stars, but since the movie is necessary to conclude the Bourne series, and I'd give the first move 5 stars, it is propped up by it predecessors and earns a third.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I've been looking to add something like this to my tool bag for a while.  Similar kits in stores looked cheap.  For the price this kit has the look and feel of quality.  Have not used it enough to know if the bits will stand the test of time and wear.  But for my purposes it will do just fine.  The only thing cheap is the case.  It's okay for a tool box.  But I usually throw tools needed in my tool bag based on what I need to work on.  The case will probably crack if I'm not careful.  No regrets on the purchase and pleased with my decision.
0515125024|4.0|Jack Reacher is...well, Jack Reacher. The perfect knight. I was amazed to read that he thought didn't know much about dogs. But since he is the Hero, he does exactly the right thing anyway.<br /><br />I could visualize the camera pans, the closeups, the clip to black in each \\"shot\\", not surprising for a writer who writes for the screen.<br /><br />The plot ranged from implausible to improbable, but no matter. I still enjoyed it. The militia characters were cartoonish? You might think so, unless you've met some of these crazies in person. Then you stop to think Lee Child has it right.<br /><br />Yes, of course I'm reading the next, and the next, whenever I want a great military fantasy yarn.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|An adult movie with adult stars -- no explosions, no vampires, no wizards, no pretty boy leads or vapid actresses - just a meaty plot with deceptions and turns enough to please a serious viewer.  To say it is a good example of film noir is not enough. It is among the best.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I'm Catholic and I don't like when Hollywood makes fun of my religion.  That said, I was worried that I'd be turned off American Horror Story in its second season because Jessica Lange portrays a nun and the season is set in a Catholic asylum for the insane.  I was concerned that Ryan Murphy would just make this a 13-episode attack on the Catholic Church.<br /><br />I love being wrong in a situation like this...and being surprised by a series.  I am a big horror fan but feel that the best and most scary movies in the genre were made in the 70s and 80s...and that ever since the advent of CGI horror stories have been mostly ridiculous...or they'd go the Scream route and be sarcastic and self-referential.<br /><br />I love what Ryan Murphy is doing with AHS and I'm someone who does not enjoy Glee or New Normal (Murphy's other two shows).<br /><br />While I think he does try to make political points, he's a great craftsman of horror.  The season one \\"Murder House\\" story was inventive and original...and has become one of my favorite haunted house stories of all time.  Season two's \\"Asylum\\" storyline (set in the early 1960s) is scary the way the Exorcist or The Omen were scary.  And the cast of actors assembled for this show is incredible.  I just love that many of them return from season to season, playing different parts.  I hope this continues for many years to come.<br /><br />I keep coming back to the word imaginative with this show because I honestly never know what's going to come at us on the screen next.  This Asylum season has a serial killer, aliens, demonic possession, Nazis, torture porn, and about a half dozen other things.  There's also a mystery set in the present as we find out what happened to the asylum to render it into ruins in our time.  I find myself sitting back and wondering what's going to happen next week once an episode ends.  And throughout the week, while waiting for the next installment, I think about what's going to come next too.<br /><br />I can't think of another show where I do this.<br /><br />A few years back, there was an anthology show called \\"Masters of Horror\\" on cable that I hoped would be a weekly, scary horror story...but it ended up being very hit or miss.  For me, American Horror Story delivers that sort of weekly, imaginative scare that I thought \\"Masters of Horror\\" would bring.  Each episode has some new twist in it...while continuing a cohesive story each season.  And then next season we get a new story.<br /><br />I really love this format and concept.  The show is very much worth your time...but it is not too gory and it is definitely not trying to force too much of Ryan Murphy's personal politics on you as I at first feared.  It's just a really great show that's way better than any horror movie I can think of made after the mid-1980s./>I can't think of another show where I do this.<br /><br />A few years back, there was an anthology show called \\"Masters of Horror\\" on cable that I hoped would be a weekly, scary horror story...but it ended up being very hit or miss.

6304806418|5.0|Madonna as Evita ? Absolutely. Banderos too?..You bet. From beginning to end this is a stunner and will watch it over and over .Too bad her image at that time sort of did not help audiences of a certain age come to see this beautifully cast and photographed film. It was also fully with no dialogue so some people may not have liked it in 1997. Will the new Les Is get the same reception? Let's hope not.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|This movie is a good Damon film with very positive message at the end of the movie.  Sure we all make choices in our lives, everyday choices what to eat, what to drink, so forth but everything else in my viewpoint is fate.  I personally enjoy this movie because me and my girlfriend who I will marry one day down road lost track of each other twice in our lifetime but found each other a 3rd time and this time were not losing each other for no reason.  The postive message in my viewpoint is if two people are meant to be together you fight to stay with that person no matter what lies within your path to them.  The plotline is easy to figure out and seen it before in tv shows and other movies, but I enjoy every moment of this movie and the acting job all the actors did to make it an enjoyable movie. Some will like it some will hate it, but watch the movie and see if you end up feeling like me about people being together and fighting to stay with them no matter what happens in your life to stop you from being with them.
B00004R76H|3.0|This was my own fault, I didn't pay enough attention and ordered a DVD instead of a CD.  I went back and looked when I received the DVD and that's what I ordered.  It was priced like a CD.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game, I really do, but it says something happened and that my results wont show up and they will give me a refund if I go to the lobby. So I go to the lobby and it gave me NO refund. I got mad that I was spending coins for no good reasons. So if that gets fixed I will be happy, but until then.....3 stars.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Great CD of their hits. Very good service and quality product. I have had very good luck ordering used CD's.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|Both of my Parents and I have used LifeProof cases for more than a year (ever since my dad ruined his iPhone while canoeing), and we love them!<br />Note: I'm not an experienced reviewer, I generally avoid writing reviews - I just thought might testimony might be helpful :)<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />* It really does protect your iPhone!<br />Handheld electronics rarely last more than a week at our house what with 4 younger siblings ranging from 17 - 6.<br />Our iPhones have been dropped, bitten, stepped on, spilled on, spit on, fought over, left outside, put in giant purses filled with everything but the kitchen sink, dropped in toilets, used in pools, been in a car crash - normal everyday wear & tear ( well, except for the car crash 😆)<br />* Cheaper than paying the insurance deductible ($169, Verizon), or buying a new phone.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />* Hard to put on and take off - You have to be very careful to not bend the back cover when removing the case<br />* It's not indestructible - My mom is on her 3rd case, and I'm on my 4th(?) - but our iPhones look brand new.<br />* They are a work in progress - the first model we got had sound issues, the next one's silent switch tended to break - but they do listen to feedback and are continually improving the design<br />* LifeProof is a small business... in Australia - Oversea shipping takes weeks (if you buy from LifeProof.com), and they really struggle to keep up with demand (despite expanding manufacturing) which results in huge backlogs.<br />* Finally, the charger port opening is only big enough for Apple brand charging cords
B006MW3V6U|3.0|This isn't a review of the content of Downton Abbey but of the quality of the download. Usually the picture is pretty good, but there are certain scenes where the picture quality is so bad and pixelated that you can't see what's supposed to be going on. I usually watch on my Kindle and even then it's blurry, so it would probably look terrible on a TV. While I haven't watched the HD version, I would recommend looking into buying it instead if you are planning to watch it on any larger sized screen.
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|A lot, and I mean a LOT of dropping the F-bomb during this movie...and that's not all of the cussing. DEFINITELY not appropriate for anyone under 18 (in my opinion). Also a lot of crude sexual suggestiveness. It definitely earned it's R rating. After watching previews I liked the story line of two &#34;bumbling&#34; cops being assigned to undercover duties at a high school. I anticipated a lot of chase, crash scenes (which it has) and humor (of which much was off-color). So if that's your preference in comedy, you'll love this movie. It just wasn't what I had anticipated.

B009PU2SX8|3.0|a very diverse collection of songs..The rocky, bluesy sound is my favorite...but the more R & B flavored selections are very good, just not my personal favorites..but all in all a good addition to your library
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in awhile. The reader is glued from the get-go and the plot is just riveting. A lot of heartache, growth. love- this book has it all, I read it in a half a weekend AND there is a sequel- Point of No Return that I ordered immediately after I finished Slammed. Don't miss out. A friend of mine recommended this series to me and that's how I heard about this writer. Enjoy!
B008X77K8W|4.0|Another collection of well written songs...Keeping it simple with a stripped down sound works so well...more artists should take note of this..bigger and louder is not always better..
0307887960|5.0|Found my weight creeping up as I hit 50 and wanted to lose ten pounds. (This is a fortunate problem to have, but can be hard to resolve the \\"last ten\\"). Looked at different diet plans and picked this one because it is so simple. No special foods and the diet as a whole was  easy to incorporate into my family's regular meals. Lost the weight and got to my \\"true weight\\" just as predicted on the Dukan website. From the beginning, found I had more energy and just felt better. Highly recommend!

This fabulous writer will hold your interest with present day and history. Her characters are delicious. And she is not afraid to throw in a little sex. Good girl Diana. So exciting that I probably live about 30 minutes from this author. My daughter Kristen Suzanne of kristensraw.com {another author} told me about the Outlander series. We read each book at the same time..how fun is that? You will love Diana's writing...enjoy.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|Perfect for any history buff who likes a bit of drama! I was happy with the set and the story line. I don't want to give away any details on the show but it was very entertaining and really made me interested in the history of the Tudors!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|My daughter just discovered this series.  We enjoy watching them together.<br /><br />The series is about a teen who helps her PI dad solve crimes, all while dealing with teen drama.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I wasn't really a batman fan until I watched Dark knight rises, then I fell in love and decided to get the trilogy. I think it's a masterpiece and a must have for a film lover. I can't wait to watch it all after school is over.
0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  I was very surprised to learn the differences in the love languages.  This really helped me understand my spouses needs so much more than I thought I knew.  Totally worth every penny.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I am a collector of the different versions of the Christmas Carol and this is one of my new favorites.  Although Patrick Stewart's version is the best for Purists, this one is a great story and told breathtakingly in animation.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. More than just zombies, great story, unpredictable . You'll definitely get hooked on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but want it less money!  I got it anyway but still it should be at like $1.99!
B009YMN5QQ|5.0|This was a great movie about birders that can be enjoyed by both birders and non-birders alike. It is educational, inspirational, and based, in part, on a true story.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|we have not given it to him yet but it looks terrific.  husband said he would like one too after seeing the box.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This dice game great fun and is so quick and easy to play.  My kids and I play it all the time.  My coworkers and I play it nearly every day at lunch and breaks.  I take these dice everywhere.  Each game takes no more than a few minutes.  These dice are used so much I think they might wear down into perfectly shaped spheres eventually.
1577314808|5.0|Life altering indeed!<br />Must be open minded.<br />Recommended to all who are willing to let go of the world's norm.
1451696191|5.0|A friend of mine read Perks of being a Wallflower when it first came out, and would rave for hours about how good it was. I'm usually skeptical when there isn't much of a description on the back (because I don't want to waste my money on a book that I end up hating,) so I only recently read it. But it doesn't need anymore of a description! You'll know what I mean.<br />I didn't put it down until I was done reading it.<br />It's a simple form of writing that is easy to read without noticing how many pages you've gone through. I was done the 200ish pages in a couple hours. The characters are easy to connect with, (I can almost guarantee you'll find someone you can relate to) and the author does an amazing job of making you care for them.<br />If you've ever read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and loved it, you'll love this book. It reminded me of a more modern version, with a little less whining.<br />I loved it, I can't say that enough.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've read many WWII Holocaust books, and I enjoyed the different angle this one is told from.  Highly innovative, heart-warming, and poignant.  Fell in love with the characters.  Loved every minute.  This is one of those books you continue to think about long after you've turned the last page.
0316228532|5.0|As a disgruntled Harry Potter fan, I read this novel more out of curiosity than real interest. I'm glad I did, since I got a very positive impression out of it in several ways.<br /><br />JKR skilfully develops a number of characters, spanning 2-4 generations, each one with its own storyline, which intermingle building up the major story. Each character is like an organ that composes a full body, and it bleeds when something happens to any of them. The language she uses is beautiful and at certain passages becomes a character by itself. The relationships among the teenagers, as well as between them and their parents play a major role, in a very realistic set of plots.<br /><br />In this story, the author shows her social concern, when a \\"well to do,\\" bucolic English town, Pagford, is met with the bills and problems of a slum from the neighbouring city, Yarville. The issue of social mobility, and the role of Pagford in making it possible, is defended by Barry Fairbrother, a councillor who was born in the slum. His death leaves his cause without a proper champion. The human face of the struggle is incarnated in Krystal Weedon, who is shown by Barry the glimpse of a better life, but is suddenly left to her own means with an addict prostitute mother, and a three year old brother. In the end, Sukhvinder Jawanda a shy, bullied and psychologically troubled teammate of Krystal in the rowing team, leaves us with a speck of hope, as she rises from her misery. Maybe the new generation will make a change for the best.<br /><br />I'm glad to see JKR has many relevant subjects to write about, and will certainly remain her devoted fan.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|At best, Grisham is a pretty good story teller. This book is him at his worst.  Either way, he is not much of a writer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I simply loved it. It brings all of your emotions to the surface. You can identify perfectly with Charlie. It brings back memories of those times you thought were forever. It's an ode to friendship, to finding your match, the eagerness and the fear of growing up, the candid feeling of belonging to the world, of loneliness and hope... at the end, those are the moments that last.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book ends so perfectly it makes you want to cry! Just loved reading all three! Chistian rocks my world!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, kept me guessing.  I couldn't put it down. I read it in a day. A must read.
B004GIR0XC|5.0|I originally read the sci fi story the movie was based upon when I was about 12 years old in the late '60s. The name of the book was &#34;Simulacrum&#34;. So I didn't know that I was watching an adaptation of the book until I was about a quarter of the way into the story. it brought a great smile to my face because it was very much true to the original story and it was very well done. I highly recommend this movie both for its seemless acting and a great story line. Also, I think many people will appreciate the surprises that occur as the mystery unfolds at a rapid fire pace. I also think that the many viewers will appreciate the forsight and vision that are an integral part of the story. Very, very enjoyable!!!
031606792X|5.0|Very good book. I wouldnt be the one to rate this book for an authors talent. As an adult i enjoyed every part.<br />Thanks
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 11 year old grandson turned me on to this. I got it for my new Kindle 8.9 . He had been using it on my husbands Kindle Fire. He went absolutely NUTS over this on mine since he already loved the game and was just bowled over by the game on my kindle. At any rate the kindle is large enough that he could teach me the game while watching an making suggestions. This game promotes anylitical thinking too, so I give it two thumbs up (which, unfortunately is the sum total of thumbs that I have or I would give it lots more).
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This a movie that really is geared towards adults and not children - and it's really, really funny in a British way! This movie is hip, modern, and full of laugh out surprises at the creative inventiveness of the story. If you like the TV Christmas specials Prep and Landing - then this is the perfect holiday movie.  My wife and I laughed so much that now that we've rented it, we'll probably buy it so that it becomes part of the standard rotation with The Christmas Story!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|this  camera is clear, easy to use, quick to download, and fun. Of course it is not a professional level camera, but it sure surprised me with its flexible features that work with other apps like photo edit and photo transfer.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|J.J. Abrams, being famous for exploiting other people's work decided upon himself that the legendary show Star Trek needed a \\"reboot.\\"  That was his first mistake.  Trying to exploit an already made audience was his second mistake, and this movie is his WORST mistake.  This is a total desecration of a timeless television series that spawned 10 movies on its own along with 4 additional series.  Yet Abrams thinks that changing timelines, the personalities of the characters and a total abortion of a late producer/creator's dream constitutes a \\"reboot.\\" Abrams thinks that manipulating and destroying the characters that became legends, overusing special effects and lens flares on EVERY shot is producing an experience that he not only thinks is better than the original, but more appealing for people who have never even experienced the classic show or original movies.  This is a travesty.  A soulless attempt to recreate something that was not only a very special experience for true Trek fans, but nothing more than a poor attempt to bring some kind of ridiculous alternative version of a true masterpiece.  The acting, the accents, the storyline and production quality is more over the top than Shatner ever was, and the manipulation of the characters, especially Spock, is something that should earn Abrams jail time for the destruction of property instead of any kind of respect for this mockery of previous material. Skip this one.  If someone gives it to you as a gift, the DVD is not even worth a coaster for your drinks.  Maybe one day Abrams will think of something on his own, but until then, as long as people support his destruction of previous art work, why should he? If there was a minus 1000 rating, I'd look for even a lower score.
B005HSL626|5.0|you get to cut up fruit and I think it is fun to cut up fruit fast I like this game very much.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Mindless but fun entertainment.  Tongue in cheek performances coupled with some exciting FX make for an enjoyable break from life's many worries.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|A movie for all family. Great and very educational movie. Highly recommended for children of all ages. Price is relatively OK.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I was anticipating a typical Ken Follett roller coaster ride, and for the most part wasn't disappointed.  Unfortunately the author assumed the role of history professor at some points in the book and that was, in some cases, mind numbingly boring.  The last 10% (Amazon Kindle's don't do page numbers) seemed to last forever, as Follett drones on and on about Russian politics at the turn of the century.  It was confusing, and had it appeared at the beginning I would have shut the book.  I do recommend it, especially to history buffs, or even those who are just interested in life at the beginning of the 20th century, but you should be prepared to learn more than you ever wanted to know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had been waiting for this to come out forever I have minecraft for Pc xbox and my phone I'm glad the wait is over
B008LZHA3G|3.0|It's Bob Dylan.  Some new stuff, along with some old, to send you back to those hazy crazy days of yesteryear.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Boring movie with gratuitous violence and characters who you never cared about. Don't waste your time with this one tonight
B000N6TX1I|1.0|PD James wrote a great book/story which was overlooked in this movie. While the scenes were well shot the story has no substance related to the history of why they are motivated. Xan (Nigel in the movie) has no explanation. The movie has TOO much emphasis on immigration policy and not about what happened. A great book turned into PC bs. The ending was so much better in the book.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I can't say enough good about Il Divo, period. They're amazing! \\"Wicked Game\\", \\"Come What May\\", and \\"Te Prometo\\" are absolutely spectacular. I really don't care for \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--but the rest of this CD far outweighs that personal dislike. And people, if you get the chance, ever, see the boys in concert!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A great battery app to keep an eye on the battery level of your Kindle. Does what it says on the tin.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|If you do not mind spells and hexes, you may enjoy this film.<br /><br />My family enjoyed the graphics more than the story line.  The Queen as a bear is hilarious and the triplets as cubs sealed the deal. So over all it was cute.<br /><br />Also, I am not on hundred percent sure but I don't think black or brown bears can be found in Ireland. Wait! Maybe they are found in the area that the film was set in.  Not sure.  Accuracy is never a big deal in Disney animated films.<br /><br />kisses!
B004LWZW6K|2.0|i didn't expect this film to be better than Aja's Piranha, but this lackluster follow up should kill off the toothy fish for good.  Setting the big final scene is a waterpark was a big mistake, as all people had to do was get out of the pool.  Director Gulager didn't even try to do anything interesting with the moment, except to throw a bunch of body parts in the water.  Uninspired on all counts, not even a good time waster on a rainy Saturday.
B0091XRL86|1.0|The story was slow. The characters , even as clay animation, were over acting. Ha. I kid., but really it was not a good. flick
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I saw the author/doctor on a television program about mysterious events several weeks ago, so when his book came out, I was anxious to read about his story.  I found him very credible and his scientific background led him to provide arguments for both sides of his conclusions.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The kids kissing on the beach is a little racy for us but funny as well. We laughed well into the night on this one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter.. She loved it. She has read the whole series and this is one of her favorites.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would rx this book to anyone. Very good, and interesting to have been written from an animals viewpoint. Good puppy!
0545265355|5.0|Beautiful hard cover set.  Actually got it cheaper as a set then I would have seperate so well worth it.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|This device worked as expected for my purposes with Backtrack.  It is plug and play with some minor tweaking so enjoy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great John Grisham novel! The Racketeer has some interesting twists in the plot; I didn't want to put it down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  loved all. The. Action and suspense in the woods.  Kept. My attention at. All times.  I  recommend this book to. All. That enjoys a good action packed read.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|This is a great doll for the price.  She is well put together and any Monster High fan will love her...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has made the semantic web available to the world; it is the future!<br />I like having Evernote available on every device across multiple operating systems and types of Operating Systems. The integration of media with notes and webclipping allows me to note or share anything including scheduling with others!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|There's very little substance to this book. The story is plodding and the characters flat. Feels like the author was in autopilot.
B009P5S11G|5.0|One of the best albums she's made, hands down. Well worth every penny!Every song is great. I think a lot of her songs relate to Chris Brown, but definitely worth listening to.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wasn't sure when I started the book that the story could sustain itself. Boy was I wrong. Thoroughly, utterly enjoyed every bit of it. Loved the character, the humour was awesome and Watney is funny as hell. For those who didn't like the profanity, well, so be it. I would have had trouble believing the character if he hadn't used profanity. He was trying to survive on Mars against almost insurmountable odds for Petes sake!<br /><br />Anyway, read this book, you won't regret a minute of it.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is one of my favorite PBS shows, and having both seasons together is a real treat for me.  It arrived quickly and I am looking forward to the new season.  I will be ready for it by catching up on each episode.  Thanks!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed the time spent playing this game.  It would have been a bit better if we needed to click to continue moving forward.  Voices would have made it so much better, but it was still a very good  game.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is just plain addicting.  Once you learn the strategies and tricks, it's easy to win often, which just keeps you coming back.  Great mental practice.  Easy to play on the Kindle while you're waiting around in line or for an appointment.<br />It frustrates me sometimes, as this version chooses where the cards go once they are tapped, but I can fix it if I disagree and it's not a deal-breaker.  Actually that feature makes it quicker and easier to play and is a teaching feature for those who are just learning the strategies.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|castle became a new old favorite at the beginning of season 3. i have been waiting to get the beginningf to see what i missed. love the beginning and this is the best price i have found ANYWHERE!!!! hope youlike it as much as i have
0812984412|1.0|It was described to me as a new product but I received a scratched up and dirty book. I don't want to give this as a present but I have no choice cause the company told me it was my fault.
B0053O89JM|5.0|house finishes the way it began... with a level of excellence rarely reached in modern television... all your favorites show up... enjoy
B00942S4OY|5.0|my daughter loved the cd... she is a one direction fan..she has the pictures all over her walls.....she listens to it everyday..
B009C7JS14|3.0|I may not be using it right but I can't get a 'forecast'.  I just received my Kindle so I'll give it another try.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this movie saw it twice in the theater and had to have it for home.<br /><br />Watched it in 3D and was okay.  Still laugh when I think of the Hulks antics.
B001HN6922|5.0|These are both a Christmas present to one of the grandsons who is obsessed with the Cars movie...and anything Cars related...these two movies will definitely make us the best!!! great shipping and packaging...I have come to expect nothing less from Amazon....
B009B8YZKS|4.0|Okay so I'm a dude and could do with out the mushy stuff.<br />I wanted more aliens, but that being said it is still a decent movie for the budget they had.<br />I could see watching more of these types of movies.
B0086700CM|4.0|Lots of lag and freezes while im playing but other than that its really adictive and such a fun game. Its about timw kindle fire made temple run ;D
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I like fantasy and time warp , the only thing I was disappointed about is the time fracture, going from one year to the future and back to the past, I hope Erin Morgenstern next book will be as enjoyable to read as this one.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|The 7s26 movement has quite a following (same movement that is in some of the Seiko monsters). It is a well respected workhorse of a movement.  I did a fair amount of research before making this purchase, and watched the price carefully for a while. The watch definitely does not disappoint. It is a very handsome watch and what I would consider to be the 'right' size for casual wear. Big enough to look masculine, but not comically large such is the fashion right now. The lume is fantastic. I charged it for 10 seconds with a Surefire 80 lumen 6P LED at 23:00 and woke up at 03:30 with the watch glowing enough for me to read it in the dark. It keeps good time for a fully mechanical unit (+ 20 seconds a day) and seems to stay wound just fine under normal daily wear. I paired it with a chocolate brown calfskin band with white stitching. This really sets the watch off in my opinion. I will try to post a pic, not sure if I can from my iPad. The red tip on the second hand looks much better in real life than in these pics on Amazon.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is an instrument, not a device. If you want to know EXACTLY what time it is ALWAYS, drop $30.00 on a Casio Waveceptor. If you want a charming, hard working time keeper with impossibly small moving parts that you can barely see with the naked eye, that will not break the bank, this is for you. Seriously, do some research on what it takes for a mechanical watch to keep steady time, regardless of the temperature or its physical orientation with respect to gravity. It's a miracle these things work at all. I suspect this will be even more accurate after I have it regulated by a watch smith. I hear tales of 2 seconds a day.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Particularly handy during Steam sales when you have to work or are otherwise away right when that one game you really wanted goes on sale. That's pretty much the only time I use this app personally, but it works just fine and does what it's supposed to. There's really no reason not to have this app if you have a Steam account. I mean, it's useful at times and is free.
B00008G7UF|4.0|From the begining to the end I was swept away by the wonderful energy that is Meg Ryan.  This is a movie that should not be missed.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I'm a big fan of Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, and Virgil Flowers. Now I can add John Corey to my list of detective characters with a sense of humor. (OK, Harry Bosch not so much.) Plum Island is a good read and a good way to get to know Detective John Corey before he starts chasing terrorists in the follow-on books.
B000MV9026|3.0|Such a cute movie!  Great price too!  My son loves these penguins and sings along with them. At this price you can't beat it!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was too long, just thrown together and should have been the dark knight that continued from batman begins after batman killed Raz Algul.
B00021HBGS|4.0|These stick very good to the tiles considering you wet them and they just stick. My son has a blast connecting all the roads and putting the cars on the tiles.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Great read.  I had read it when I was a young teen and it was great to revisit it as an adult.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books (usually in less than a day or two for each) and love his writing style. Once I start one of his books I can't put it down until I am done.
B009POCFTG|4.0|blu ray version review -<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br />a really good movie, tense, gory and gritty.<br />great video and audio really rocks.<br />a must have for your collection.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|this was not a good movie. bad catwomen along with a bad story line. really the police are living under ground? they put cat women in a mans prison? you dont think all the excons where rapeing and killing all the civlins?? they would have been no city for him to come back to! and how in the hell did he make it back to the city so fast? he had a broken back with the bone out! they punched it back in, he could not beat bane when he was better but then got a broken back and could not lose. baddddddddddddddd movie! and that was just a few problems with it
B005LAIIQC|4.0|review on the blu ray version of this movie as follows -<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4 / 5<br />though not the best of the series, this one ends for another film to follow.<br />video was crisp and audio was good.<br />looking forward to the followup...
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun game, but could get so much more done if every character pitched in. Only game like this that I've seen where they don't.  What's up with that?
B00899E5B4|5.0|This record is such a fine example of two pop maestros applying their best magic and creating something that is fun to hear, fun to sing-along with and puts a bounce in your step. Plus the added bonus of being able to relate to the lyrics. Excellent recording for both Joe Walsh fans and Jeff Lynne fans!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|In an industry chocked with fads, gimmicks and pseudo science, Mike's book stands out with it's grounded approach. Very impressed with his clear, back to basics approach. If you are just starting out or trying to get back to training, Mike's book will ensure you have a solid foundation.
B006ZZQH4W|5.0|What can one say about Maeve Binchy except that she never disappoints This book is so readable and true to life Excellent read<br />Buy it or you will have missed out on a great story
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely amazing. After having watched it through and through a few times I honestly can say that I don't think I've ever watched a series I wanted continued more than this one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is ok. being able to drag and drop pins into boards would make it easier to pin. the pull down for board selection doesn't always work for me.
B007JMW46U|5.0|The short stories are wonderful!<br />Especially if you don't have a lot of time for a full novel.<br />Would recommend it to everyone!
B00008S7KC|1.0|pink floyd live at Pompeii The DVD is not any good when I try to load it in player I get a message Error so I wasted my money on it.
0316067601|5.0|This book is very interesting to read, because it goes into how Navy Seals are selected and trained to be the ultimate warriors that they are. The personal story of Mr. Luttrell goes from a normal childhood in a small town in Texas, to the Seal training camp in California; where the brutal regimen is designed to weed out the weak and temper the fighting spirit of the Seal and his team. Then the story picks up the pace even more, once the Seal team lands in the drop zone in Afghanistan, looking for their target: an important Taliban commander. From the moment of the ambush to Mr. Luttrell's rescue by Army Rangers, the reader is on the edge of his seat, as the action and suspense is non-stop.<br />A great read for those who love not only military history, but personal stories about courage, hope and survival despite overwhelming odds.<br />Ps. I believe that the men made the only morally defensible choice in letting the Shepherds go; an alternative not considered (or discussed by Mr. Luttrell), but which should have been, was to abort an already compromised mission.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was riveted. I was proud. I was astonished. I was incensed. I was sad.<br /> I was just watching a NAT Geo show on the killing of OBL and they referenced these guys. When they showed a few glimpses of the Taliban with the bodies of the three, I was incensed.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book... love my Kindle
B0072OFM28|4.0|I love this series.  I missed HBO Rome when it left.  This series helped make up for its absence.  I know I am going to miss it after the final season.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|This movie is just as cheesy and weird as I remember from when I first saw it, and rusts what makes it great. Highly recommended.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I have bought and gifted this movie several times.  I watch it with house guests and every time I watch it I love it anew.  In my sixties now, I remember the times, the clothes, the hair dos and the female attitude towards marrying off the daughters.  I cannot say much more other then I love Viola Davis!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|When I received this these discs, I couldn't stop watching them.  So within a week I had seen seasons 1 and 2.  I'm waiting for season 3.  The acting was suburb.  The costumes were magnificent.  I loved it.

B00846REIS|5.0|This book though it replicated fifty shades of grey it was good I will have to read the rest! Thanks
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Channing Tatum makes this movie one hundred percent AWESOME!! he is shirtless half the time and true eye candy. I would sincerely recommend this movie to some girls that think channing Tatum is super cute.<br /><br />definitely worthy of five stars((:
B009JBZH54|1.0|This is NOT a negative review of the Movies but the 5 disk set<br /><br />Biggest issue the switching of aspect ratio during the Dark Knight Rises.  Changes from wide-screen letterbox to full screen 16x9 throughout the film.  It is very distracting and WB should offer replacement disk free of charge. This is blockbuster film this should never happen.<br /><br />The second issue is the special feature disks, is just foo foo.  There is nothing insightful just rather plain interviews and the navigation is horrible.  I didn't purchase the set for these but if they are included make them worthwhile not just an advertising gimmick.<br /><br />Ultraviolet only allows you to use Flixster or VUDU to host the video.  These cloud advertising sites that mine your data for $$ while hosting a so so copy of the movie.  A better option would be to allow private YouTube up loads.  Ultraviolet is a broker skimming off the top and adding no value to the process.  I try not support these types of companies it just encourages them.  Like anything cloud you could lose access to these at anytime.

B0006GANN2|5.0|Read the book first by Popeye Egan, then saw this film, and boy what a film.  Great scenes of NYC, elevated trains, gritty street scenes, unsavory characters, NYC in winter, great chase scene under the el, Gouvernor Hospital.  Have watched this<br />DVD a couple of dozen times already.

1603427244|2.0|First, a health and safety warning:  be VERY careful about the metal spiral binding! They put two disconnnected sections of wide spiral binding inside.  This gives you four stiff, sharp metal ends.  Two of the sliced ends face the middle, leaving a space between them that's only a little smaller than the width of my hand.  With the book turned back to the info on the back cover page in my knitting bag, I reached in and caught my hand in this 'trap'.  I scratched myself badly as the book hung from my hand by by the wickedly sharp cut ends.  It then raked me open on both sides of my hand as it fell off me.  Ouch!  It also managed to snag my very nice merino/silk knitting.  The book doesn't have a recessed edge on top and bottom so the outside cut ends are right at the edge of the book.  If you're reading in bed, they can snag your clothes or yarn or--again--you.  Be careful.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book because it's mainly a photo tutorial book.  As such it lives and dies based on the quality of the tutorials.  Some of the explanations I found to be lacking in some of the cast ons that I know how to do..  I'm not sure I could've gotten from point A to point B by the text alone, if I didn't already know how to do it.  I guess they assumed the photos speak for themselves.  They don't always--partly because of the size and partly because of how they chose to show which steps, when.  It needed lines or pointers or something, the way they did it, to sometimes make clear what concept went with what step.  I'd urge beginners especially to steer clear of this book.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me, however, is the photo size relative to the content's scale in the tutorial step-by-step shots.<br /><br />I preordered this book.  I was excited to get it.  I love a good reference  book.  It came pretty scuffed up.  The two outer corners are already delaminating.  The stock doesn't seem very good.  And I didn't check the dimensions first (live and learn).  I was disappointed by how small the book was, when it arrived.  Given that, it's almost shocking how small they made the tutorial pictures.  The macros are ok--if overly cropped at times--as they are only a few stitches in length, to show an edge or detail.  But the meat of this book--the tutorials of the cast ons and bind offs--they're barely half the size of an already very small page.  We're talking pictures that can be barely an inch tall, by two-plus inches long.  Very small!  The chosen photo scale is terrible because many of the photos are long shots that includes two full hands, needles and the knitting in progress itself.  These aren't closeups.  So when you look at what is going on at the business end of the needles--well, wow.  That occupies a tiny little space in a tiny picture on half the width of a small page in a small book.  It's very difficult to tell at times what's going on.  Matters are made worse by different yarn colors, some very dark, and some so white the highlights are nearly blown, making it hard to define white stitches from one another.  And highly reflective silver needles don't help with clarity.<br /><br />I have no idea what those in charge were thinking when they published this book.  Probably--Oh, hey, this is a useful reference so let's make it small enough to fit in your knitting project bag.  Nice idea but implemented poorly.  It's a FAIL for me here, given the photos are so small given the scale of their content that it doesn't work.  It does me as a knitter no good to carry a book in my bag where the tutorials are too small to see.  I'd rather have had a full-sized book.  I don't mind toting that in a bag as long as it has information I can actually see.  That's not the case here, sadly.<br /><br />There are other things I don't like about it.  I don't like how they did the material on the front and back covers.  Inside, the text font is not exactly comic sans, but I found it overly decorative and annoying to read.  The layout is weird, with wasted space (Really?  In a book this small you can afford to waste this much space?), different textures used as background, layouts with rounded edges that don't really need to be there, different cropping shapes like squares, rectangles, and circles, etc.  Why didn't they at least make the photos go all the way to an edge instead of halfway across the small page, and then put the writing under each picture?  Maybe it would've made the book thicker or something, too thick for their spiral binder.  I don't know.  But the whole design of it feels like a high school yearbook--a little amateurish.  This would've been forgivable in a blog.  That's what this reminds me of, come to think--it's as if whoever art designed it is used to doing photo tutorials on a blog or web site and just carried the same thing over to here.  But it's not a blog.  I can't just click on a tiny tutorial photo and have it enlarge enough to zoom in to see what's going on right at the tip of the needles.  I'm stuck with the size it is.<br /><br />I looked at the publisher, and thought \\"oh.\\"  I realized I had a book by them once before that had its own bad choices like really thin paper, neon red title fonts, and half sunk-in ink on the photographs.  Fortunately that book was published abroad by a different publisher and I was able to get a better copy that way.  I'm not sure what the deal is, but I'll personally steer clear of crafting books by this publisher in the future.<br /><br />Very disappointed.ith wasted space (Really?

His masterful grouping of personalities in his cabinet and his enlightened pursuit of re-establishing the Union and abolishing slavery is a story everyone should read.

0545123275|5.0|Ever since Grace was attacked by wolves , she's had an unnatural obsession with the creatures. And there is one in particular that seems to always be watching out for Grace over the years. Sam lives a double life- half the year he's a teenage boy, and half the year he's a wolf. He's watched Grace from a distance, always staying and the fringes, but when he needs help, he turns to Grace and turns both of their lives upside down.<br /><br />When Big Honcho Media asked me to run a contest featuring Shiver and it's sequel, Linger, I jumped at the chance as soon as I read the blurbs for the books. The books are promoted as YA, but I think they will be enjoyed by anyone who likes paranormal love stories.<br /><br />The world Ms Stiefvater created is quite interesting. She took a different route when creating her werewolves, not sticking with convention. I particularly liked the character of Sam. He was very well-developed and likable. For me, Grace was a little harder to grasp. I think it has to do with the fact that I couldn't relate to her, with the absentee parents and an unhealthy obsession. But Sam and Grace together just worked. They are both different and don't fit into their own worlds, but happen to fit with each other.<br /><br />Shiver was a pretty fast read and I can't wait to move on to Linger, as Sam and Grace's story continues.

B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I have often thought that, yes, popular books may not always share the finest literary styles, devices, or elegance, and may lack in character depth, in thematic development, in intellectual interest--but would fulfill reader expectations of pacing, of suspense, of interest. Well, judging from this volume, apparently they needn't fulfill such expectations either. I got to page 50 or so and then let myself stop reading.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Received two days ago and fantastic so far.  Purchased from A2ZWatches (fulfilled by Amazon).  Watch came in original packaging from Seiko, with tags attached.  Band is a little uncomfortable at first over long periods of time, but seems like it will soften with more use.  Very lightweight watch, and I think the size is perfect; will fit most male wrists and larger female wrists.  Beautiful to look at.  Haven't calculated time lost/gained over the two days I've worn it, but it can't be more than 15 seconds.  Very pleased with watch and seller.

B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This was an entertaining and funny movie and my wife and I enjoyed seeing it.  It was not as fresh as the first or second one but I love the characters and the premise of the movie that we are living among aliens of many races.  This one is interesting as a particularly evil and mean alien escapes from a prison on the moon and his goal is to get back at Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) for imprisoning him and cutting off his arm.<br /><br />Agent J (Will Smith) has to go back into time to save K or the whole earth may be lost.  The movie is entertaining and Josh Brolin does an excellent job of portraying the young Agent K in the past.  He and Will Smith made the movie.  Of course the special effects and the aliens were just out of this world and it was fun to watch the interaction between Will Smith and the two actors who played the younger and older Agent K.  There were lots of funny one liners and a lot of action to keep you interested.<br /><br />My wife and I rated this movie a 4 star ranking.  It is well worth seeing and you will enjoy it.  It is not a five star movie as it just doesn't seem as fresh and original as the first Men In Black movie.  It is the third sequel after all and some of the items are getting repetitive.  We both enjoyed Josh Brolin playing the younger agent K and perhaps if another sequel comes out he can become a full time replacement for Tommy Lee Jones who is starting to show his age.<br /><br />Rent it or download it because it is worth seeing once and you will have a few good laughs. If you are a Men In Black fan then buy it as you will enjoy it over and over. .  I recommend it to you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it sooooo much! Its really fun and is great for all ages. It does let you purchase things, but it warns you first. Best. App. EVER!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|My wife and just finished this movie and we liked it.  It is a dark movie about Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who has not been out as Batman in over 8 years.  An evil terrorist threatens Batman's beloved Gotham City and he has to shake off his physical and mental depression and save the city or watch as it is destroyed.<br /><br />The cinematography and characters were excellent and the acting was well done.  The movie was very good but for me it seemed just a bit long as if they did not know how to reduce its size.  It is an excellent close to the trilogy through. The movie contained a lot of character development and flashbacks to build the scenario of what was taking place and why the characters behaved the way they did.  I think that is why the movie was so long but it still held our interest as the storyline was good.  The character Bane (Tom Hardy) was portrayed as a cold blooded and vicious killer with no respect for personal life.  In essence he was a perfect villain to face Batman's heroic effect to save Gotham.<br /><br />The special effects were very good and over all we were entertained.  I recommend the movie to you.

B008IJT0CE|3.0|This app does pause or skip in between loops on the beats. It is also hard to hear if there is a lot of background noise around you. I put headphones on to help with hearing if I don't want my main volume on max. However, the volume problem is the same in every app or video I have used so far. Personally, I am enjoying this app. I got it to explore piecing together beats that are relaxing.

B006TVQTHW|5.0|purchased this case locally a month or so ago as I needed something bigger for the new cooler on the secondary video card, the bottom psu placement is nice, the ease of installing all the HDs and dvds also was very pleasant, wish there had been an adapter to attach the front usb header to an older motherboard with USB2 but it was a quick fix thanks to ebay, best surprise was the overall drop in tempuratures across the board, CPU, 2 nvidia cards, and even the hard drive temps dropped, only complaint is I have no idea how to open the front to get at the intake filter that looks like the picture on the box, but all in all still a great case and highly recommended for the price.

B009YU62H2|3.0|The reunion thing is always tough to judge appropriately. Often times, it just gets dismissed as a money grab or a desperate attempt to recapture some long lost magic. But, what if it's just time for the band to work together again on their own terms?<br /><br />By all accounts, that's the case with the new Soundgarden record and upcoming tour. Luckily, King Animal isn't a desperate attempt to recapture the past, it's a pretty strong record. There's nothing here that will tarnish their reputation; in fact, much of this material fits perfectly in their catalog. If you're a fan, this is certainly worth buying.

0307887960|3.0|I can't say I gave this diet a fair chance. I lost 4 lbs the first week I went on the diet which is great, but then mid-week 2 (lost 2 lbs) I started having massive headaches from only eating protein and the lack of carbohydrates. I was still in phase 1 at that point so it's suppose to be all protein and no vege's just yet. I probably should have pushed through the headaches and waited until I got to phase 2 (alternating of protein only and vege/protein days until you get to your goal weight) to see if I could truly handle the diet and see results. Also it's pretty uncomfortable during phase 1 when you're a little backed up from lack of fiber. So if you can handle the side effects than give it a try!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Science and ingenuity are the rule of the day if you're going to survive, when you wake up to find yourself - an astronaut landed on Mars - abandoned and given up for dead by the members of your team, now on their way back to Earth.  This really is a fun read, and it showcases the amazing fertility of the human brain in overcoming the enormous perils associated with the unremitting hostility of space and places like Mars.  I found myself reading late into the night.  Thoroughly enjoyable, completely believable.  Andy Weir's \\"The Martian\\" is a terrific story for a bargain price.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of the absolute best films I have ever seen! Moonrise Kingdon beautifully reminisces on the childhood adventure in all of us. It portrays the wonder and lore of discovering new lands in the imagination of a child. The film takes place in rural coastal Maine, which is an ideal setting for this theme. All in all, Moonrise Kingdom is a phenomenal film sure to stir up sentimental feelings of the childhood in each of us.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Imagine looking, sounding like and bearing the name (and DNA) of someone so vile that others cringe when they see you.  Your father. A powerful duke who closed factories, destroyed lives, raped women, and abused his own wife. A man who callously separated you from your mother, made you feel it was your fault at a tender age... and caused your mother to harden herself even from your own tenacious infant charms.<br /><br />Robert Blaisdell walks around in his father's younger skin. He has his father's well-feared cold eyes.  He has been told his entire life that he's just like the old man. And yet... he couldn't be any different. Bewildered by his neglect at an early age, he repeatedly attempts to make his mother love him through the trickery that only a little one can employ.  His estranged mother (estranged by order of the Duke) feels that his innocent attempts are the cold machinations of his father.  She rejects her little boy repeatedly.  He finally grows up into a man who yearns for love, but would never dare ask for it.<br /><br />When the Duke dies (Robert is younger when this happens), Robert becomes the Duke of Clermont, making his transformation complete... he loses even his name, becoming 'Clermont'.  But what does this really mean to him? His father is a rapist... Robert never lays with a woman out of wedlock.  He fears becoming his father so much that he refuses to even take a chance on hurting someone who isn't going to be in a position to deny him (who can say no to a duke? unless you are a higher ranking peer?).<br /><br />So he becomes a secret radical.  The man is nothing like his father and he learns that the only way he can fight his father's legacy is to make sure others with his power cannot abuse it.<br /><br />Robert has a brother, Oliver, from the events of the Governess Affair.  He meets and mistreats him at Eton, as boys are wont to do, when he learns that the Boy's father is his own father's enemy. Then Oliver looks at him with his father's eyes and he realizes... this is his own kin.  The truth rights itself.  Oliver is result of his father's rape of a woman.  His father is evil, and Robert's own attacks on Oliver make Robert the villain.  At that moment he abandons his quest to knock the poser down and welcomes him as a brother.  Oliver holds his own, and only agrees because he can see that Robert has decency in him.<br /><br />The best part of the book are moments between Robert and the Marshall family, Oliver included.  I love the moments between Robert and Serena, Oliver's mother.  When she first meets him, she flees from the teenager because he looks exactly like his father... and his father brutally took her virginity years ago.  Then when the family is in crisis when Oliver is being blamed for Robert's sedition (on purpose - those who do it know the truth, but a Duke cannot be touched), they meet again.  Robert is humble, abject and ashamed. Serena ... well, it's just lovely.<br /><br />More of them would have been amazing, but I understand this was a story of Robert. And Minerva... and the others were in it to the extent that they had to be.<br /><br />Brilliant work.

B005LAIGLE|4.0|I like drama and cop shows.  I have not watched this yet but have heard from friends it is very good.
0761163808|5.0|This is a fun &#34;photicular&#34; book. It's both educational regarding some animals found in Africa as well as visually an adventure for young and old.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I purchased this to completed the set of House.  Recommend to those who watch drama, guilt, and interesting medical concepts even if they aren't necessarily true.
B00979CS50|5.0|This album from Neil Young and Crazy Horse, although sometimes sounding of poor recording quality and at times &#34;slow&#34;, is totally &#34;awesome&#34; for this old guy of 67 years old. For me it brings back the &#34;good old&#34; times. Let your mind open with no expectations of this album, relax and you'll most likely enjoy it as much as I do. Peace.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Sexual tension, but no smut.  Are the events in the book crazy? Yes, but who reads a romance novel for the \\"everyday\\" stuff?  We read them because it's all fantasy.  Great story, fun characters, and a quick read.
0316228532|5.0|bought this for my daughter, she loves it. i am thinking anything from J.K will be a great book. must read.

1440503257|5.0|As an American citizen, some of the ingredients this book calls for in recipes seems a little weird. Once you give it a try you'll be hooked forever!!! I use these recipes all the time for any occasion and my friends love that they come from a Harry Potter themed cookbook!!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|The bad:<br /><br />Loaded with ads, a resource hog, and since when has the weather channel been right? If you believe them, you'd never leave your home.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Use weatherbug, or accuweather. They can get you better forecasts that are closer to your home. Weatherbug, which I use, has no ads. My wife has accuweather, it has a pretty interface, and no ads.
B009A9EYUO|4.0|It's a great album, only problem is that the first track (Bombtrack) is skipping in a few parts of the song. No signs of significant damage, ordered from amazon store. Should I send back?
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a super recording of Rod Stewart's gravel voice and the music is uplifting for this holiday season. I bought the music on CD and have transferred it to a mini-disc to play on my Sony Walkman device and the sound is even spectacular after re-recording it.  I've listened to it almost a hundred time already.  The price was a bargain for me and the fast shipping was a suprise for the busy shoping season.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|The Iron Lady starring Meryl Streep was written by Abi Morgan and directed by Phyllida Lloyd. Before giving a critique I need to give accolades to Meryl Streep's performance. She has to be one of the greatest character actresses of our day.<br /><br />The movie takes place in present day after Margaret Thatcher has served as prime minister. She is elderly and is struggling to grasp reality. She talks with her dead husband and has moments where she still thinks that she is the Prime Minister. The film is riddled with flashbacks-most occurring whilst she is having hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband. These flashbacks give us glimpses of the Ladies childhood, her marriage, motherhood, and political career. Some of the flashbacks are of very happy times, e.g. her husband proposing and their dancing together after Margaret's first election bid loss. Other flashbacks lead us to conclude that Margaret was driven by her career more than she was driven to be a present mother or wife. She calls herself a public servant and as such can not ignore the need she sees for a good leader. When her then boyfriend proposes she says with tears in her eyes, `Beyond all the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must matter. I can not die washing up a tea cup.'<br /><br />There are a few key elemental thoughts in the movie. One among them is the very obvious fact that Margaret Thatcher forged ahead in a world dominated by men. In the movies' present she makes the comment that she has always preferred the company of men. During the movie, however, most of the other politicians are made to seem sinister through clever camera work. No doubt it was difficult for Margaret to forge her way, but her campaign leaders played on her differences to get her elected. She was dubbed, by a Russian reporter, the Iron Lady. She seemed to have no problem making herself heard among men.<br /><br />Another big theme is the idea that you must do something if you are able-make yourself useful. There is an scene where she in sharing her views on economics and politics with a room full of men and says that what people really need to do is to do something about the situation they find themselves in and stop complaining about it. She makes a reference to `good housekeeping' when faced with the reality that money may need to be stretched from week to week for the working man...or woman. A present day scene in the movie shows a younger woman thanking Margaret for the influence that she has had on her and for showing women that they can be something. Margaret replies to this only by exclaiming that everyone now seems to care more about being something than doing something. This is an interesting take on the existential understanding of our place in the `grand scheme'. Again, when at the doctor and asked how she feels (in conjunction with the grief of her husbands death), Margaret replies with:<br /><br />What am I bound to be feeling? People don't think anymore. They feel. Oh, how are you feeling? Well I don't feel comfortable. Oh, I'm so sorry...we the group were feeling...(clears throat)...Do you know, one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people that care more about feelings than they do about thoughts and ideas. Now, thoughts and ideas-that interests me!<br /><br />This is fascinating because it shows that the former Prime Minister was defined by something that could be weighed more substantially. Margaret was pragmatic and concerned with fact. She was not easily swayed by the feelings of others. This plays out truly in the film as we see the results of her strict economic legislation as well as her relationship with her children.<br /><br />As the film draws to a close you get the sense that Margaret is searching for peace at the end of her life. It is here that I must hand it to Mr. Godawa who said that most of the stories in movies are about redemption. Margaret is searching for redemption and peace. She is hauntedby her husband. She replays memories of riots, her daughters unhappiness with her mother, and the film makes her son's absence very poignant. The climax of the story is an elderly Margaret Thatcher packing up all her husbands things and finally saying goodbye. She makes a hard choice but she wants to be at peace. The very last scene is Margaret washing up her tea cup. She has fought and accomplished something great with her life and she has accepted whatever the costs were. Now, she is not afraid to die while washing up.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|Originally, I had issues concerning the description that was posted at the time that I had purchased this item. However, due to some excellent customer relations, the previous misconception has been cleared up.<br /><br />On to the good stuff: This company is trustworthy and full of integrity. This product is a solid performer that does exactly as described. The simplicity of programming the light patterns makes it a sure success for all ages, and it is an extraordinary product. Don't fall for the knock-offs of MonkeyLectric just because they are less expensive. I am a big believer in the old adage: \\"You get what you pay for,\\" and these lights live up to expectations.<br /><br />Above all else, these lights are conducive to your children's safety. They really light up the wheels and it is virtually impossible to miss someone on a bicycle when they have these lights attached to the wheel(s).
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This review will be different from so many 5 stars.  I'm not going to discredit the 5-star ratings, I think it would be good to read how Courageous is, in fact, not opinion, a great movie.<br /><br />My father was born a 7th child of a prostitute (my natural grandmother).  He and my aunts and uncles were taken by the state at a very young age.  My father and one of my aunts ended up in a foster home.  My father was beaten on regular basis by his foster mother and brother.  His foster father however did treat him well but did nothing to stop the abuse.  And his foster family called themselves Christian.  My dad lived with them all the way through high school.  My dad through out his hard times chose to remain faithful to Jesus Christ and His teachings.  My dad became a well-known evangelist and often worked with the Billy Graham Crusades.<br /><br />Now, would this make my review irrelevant since the Sheriff points out the stats of troubled youth in a fatherless household?  No.  My father told me when I told him I wish to be a father some day that he was proud to hear me say that.  Dad said the reason he wanted to be a father (a good father) was that way my two sisters and I would never experience what he went through growing up.  Dad always emphasized the need of having fathers in the household.<br /><br />Also, my dad later went back to his foster family to make amends with my Grandma Weirbach (dad's foster mother) asked for dad's forgiveness and he did.  I had great times with Grandma Weirbach until her death.<br /><br />I am about to be a father myself.  My fiancee made mistakes in her life choices but repented and came back to the Lord.  My future son is the middle child and unlike the oldest sister and the youngest brother his father abandoned them when he was born.  As soon as I came into their lives I wanted to let my future son know that I want to be his father and by the grace of God I will raise him well.  Just as Courageous portrays.  I've only met my future son once because I have been on deployment, but his behavior turned from bad to good.  He's doing better in school, he is now a top player in his soccer team, and he tells me he loves me on the ship-to-shore phone.  So I am a witness to the power of fathers to the fatherless.<br /><br />I want my son (whom I will be adopting), stepdaughter (who I may adopting as well, long story) and stepson to have the life I had the blessing of God to have.  I do not want them to fall into the selfishness of a humanist world.  I will be bringing them up as Christians and that by my example they will take my faith as their own.<br /><br />I just bought Courageous here on Amazon after seeing it twice on my deployment, which I'm coming home from; this message must be taught to those who are willing to step out of ignorance and listen.<br /><br />And finally, I have read all of the one-stars here.  They are nothing more than anti-Christian propaganda.  They claimed they have seen the movie and use scenes from it to prove it.  Well I seen similar prejudice reviews on anti-Christian websites by those who did see the movie only to not listen to the message but find ways to make it sound \\"evil.\\"<br /><br />If you do get this movie listen to it's message.  A lot of one-stars are right that it's not Hollywood acting, it's real-life acting.  So I got Courageous and Fireproof on Blu-Ray because I am going to make sure that the whole family watches.  Maybe make it a tradition.  Because it's rare to find a positive, uplifting movie in this day and age of \\"pessimism is cool.\\"<br /><br />FINAL NOTE:  You will be ROFLing at the \\"Snake Kings\\" scene. X-D
034580404X|5.0|A nice boxed set.  Will be able to share them.  Good service.  Good price.  Haven't finished them yet - will this winter.
B0091LS07E|5.0|When I first played this album I was not feeling some of the songs and I think it was because I was hoping to hear the old Alicia.<br />So at first I was disappointed.<br /><br />BUT after the second, third, fourth etc, etc, listen this album is FIYAH!!! It still is the same strong, I am woman hear me roar Alicia, but she has soften up a little.<br />This album is a lovers album and it has a fun, happy go lucky feel to it. I love the change from Alicia she is definitely brand new!!
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|When I first watched this movie I was totally disappointed because it was nothing at all like &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34;. I was expecting intense drama/action and I got comedy. When I watched it again expecting &#34;dramedy&#34; I loved it! Action movies get old, I seldom watch Khan any more, but I have watched &#34;The Voyage Home&#34; dozens of times over the years.<br />Great interaction between the characters. Great lines. No gratuitous sex of violence. Just great entertainment!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This classic is a wonderful story to share, as my mother shared with the story with myself, my sister, and our three brothers I have shared it with my sons. I introduced it as a first chapter book to my son and he loved it so much he wanted to build a secret garden. Now my other son loved the classic movie and we have begun to read it together, he loves the &#34;kid who yells and is bossy.&#34;
075669812X|5.0|The booked arrived on time and in perfect condition. My nephew will be thrilled, this book has all the characters he loves!
B00006JIA4|4.0|Probably should've just bought the individual songs I wanted off iTunes instead of paying for 3 cds for 5 songs...
B0063IH60K|4.0|solitaire is sooo addicting! I love this app!;) this game is very easy to use and I like that I can find other games to play without closing the app. what I don't like is that when i start a new game i have to stop and watch an advertisement other then that it's a great game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it when I come across a series that I just can't put down. I read all three fifty shades books in four days. I can't wait for the author to write more!!!
B001BPJJ82|4.0|The visuals on this film are really amazing, it's said it took Tarsem (the director) five years to fil ite. There are some things in this movie I've never seen before<br />The story on the other hand is a bit loose, but it's good nonetheless, cobining the real world with fantasy, and has some moments that are truely emotionally resonant.<br />Overall this movie is simply just beautifull, trust your eyes are about to be delighted.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Still reading it, but I love Philippa Gregory novels.  I have yet to read a bad one.  On of my favorite authors.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is insane (in the good sense) it's over the top and alltogether hillarious. At times it's like a cartoon, some times it's like a videogame, and it really looks like a three-dimmensional live action comic book, pretty much like Sin City or 300.<br />The story is good and the ending satisfaying although it gets a little bit loose in the third act (I think this because it's a movie adaptation of six graphic novels by Brian Lee O'Maley so it's understandable that some characters get left out or receive a minor treatment). However this are just minor issues because this film is just amazing, trust me youre gonna have a great time.
B0072IUZUS|5.0|My 12-year-old daughter loves both dragons and Schleich items, so she was excited when she saw this.  It arrived quickly, and she LOVES it!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the dragon we got is actually red, not brown like in the picture.  However, the seller handled this mistake very well, and I give kudos to the seller.  My daughter actually likes the red one better, so she was happy with the mistake.
B004FOJZXU|5.0|This film downrigth amazing, the pacing is brisk, tha acting is good, the cast is phenomenal, the story is brilliant and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen, specially the ones that involve Arthur, and are done (most of them) with practicall efects which only makes them better.<br />The story is really good, smart and emotional, and allthough it takes place in the reallity and in the dreams of the protaganists this is not a movie about dreams it's more a movie about ideas, and the perception of reallity, and of course the power of the mind, it's also a movie about forgiveness and redemption with an ending that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Pixar again takes us on a journey although this time it's in Scotland. The characters are amazing. The mother daughter bond is priceless.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This movie is an adaptation of the books by belgian author Herge, it's directed by the one who brought new life to the pulp adventure genre with his Indiana Jones saga Steven Spielberg, its produced by Lord of the Rings Director Peter Jackson, the screenplay comes from the hand of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the dead, Spaced). Now if any of those names don´t ring any bells to you, well this movie might not be for you, but you should still check it out because yeah it's awesome. The story follows young reporter Tin Tin and his dog milou (yes that's his name not snowy), and captain Archivald Haddock in their adventure to discover the misteries behind the unicorn a ship long lost in the deep seas. This movie uses the mo-cap technique and it does it brilliantly, it´s funny, clever, action-packed and of course full with adventure, for kids and adults to enjoy, its after all a movie for the entire familly. So as Tin Tin puts it &#34;How is your thirst for adventure&#34;
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I can't wait til the next one.  Great graphics.  I turned the sound down but that was just my preference.  A good game for a small price.  A great game for the free game of the day.  Keep them coming!

B001LV5OOY|5.0|I originally started with their Ritual album which didn't take long to fall into a constant rotation.<br />This album which is two years before Ritual isn't quite as polished but certainly has some great songs.<br />I have recommended both albums to friends and they have been taken positively.

1451638450|3.0|REVISION 6/18/13 - I've reread the Vorkosigan series again, with this book being last.<br />I have upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 3. I have been so use to Miles and his persona, I think the first time I read this I was expecting (hoping) for Miles.  Having reread the book, expecting Ivan instead I found most of the book okay, even funny at times.  There was a part in the middle that Ivan's dialog was just plain weak.  He seems stronger at the beginning of the book and at the end.<br /><br />I'm like many fans of Bujold.  About every 2 years I take the Vorkosigan saga out, dust if off, and greet my good friends in Miles' family.  I had high hopes for this book.  I preordered it in hardcover. When it arrived I started reading almost immediately.  The book is like Ivan (the main character) - it does not contain a lot of substance. Even with that, I am usually very entertained by Bulold's writing.  I devour her other books. But I was disappointed, very disappointed, with this book.<br /><br />Read any of Bujold's other books, and you will likely enjoy every moment of it.  But don't bother reading this book.<br />Sorry Lois... you need to try harder next time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay exceeded my standards, how the story played out, how at the end of each and every chapter, it makes you want more. I really love how it all went, the twists and turns in the book. Astounding, but what caught me off guard was the epilogue.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great set for a Dark Knight fan! The booklet is nice, digital copies of all 3 movies plus a 23 minute sneak peek of the batmobile documentary, and 5 blu rays for less then $30 is a great deal!
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|I enjoyed everything about this purchase EXCPT digital copy version.  I attempted numerous times to download to iTunes and it would freeze when 98% of download was complete.  I even contacted Paramount informing them of my problem.  They issued a new redemption code but I obtained same results as before.  They could not provide further assistance.  Not sure if other customers experienced same problem.  Can Amazon provide another solution other than returning product?  I really do want the digital version of this movie for my growing collection.  I would have given this product 5 STARS if it was not for digital copy download problem.
0446573027|4.0|I enjoy everything that David Baldacci writes and was so happy to see that he has introduced a new character, John Puller.  I enjoyed Zero Day so much that I downloaded the next John Puller book to my kindle, \\"The Forgotten.\\"  Puller is another larger than life military hero turned investigator who partnered with the local female police sergeant in this book.  It was a fast-paced story that grabbed my attention from the first page and never let go.  Baldacci is a master at weaving a backstory into his work without bogging the reader down with it.  This makes his work tight and concise - perfect for the type of drama featured in Zero Day.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait to begin The Forgotten and to continue getting acquainted with John Puller.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Phillipa Gregory is one of my favorite authors, and she didn't disappoint me with this.  If you like historical fiction set in medieval England, you need to read this one!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.there are so many levels, I will probably never finish.  I really appreciate the frequent updates with many new puzzles.  The latest update now has random puzzles added so you will literally never complete them all.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I put one at the top and one at the bottom of a dark staircase.  They work everytime in the night making the stairs much safer.  There was no easy way to wire a light, and switches at the top and bottom.  These make a much easier and cheaper fix.  They do not go on during the day and batteries seem to last a very long time.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Every 7 year old will go crazy about it. It's very nice and sweet. In the middle there is a sad part, but you won't cry because it's not that sad. It is a very nice movie to watch during the Christmas season. It has Christmas spirit. My favorite part is that there is a love story in it.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I got this special edition as a gift for my boyfriend.  I knew he would love it, being the huge &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan that he is.  However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I'm a &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan, myself, but I usually prefer the original cast and am usually not impressed with &#34;prequels&#34;, this was definitely the exception!
B008I43DYU|5.0|A nice calculator that works well and I really like the selection of skins. It has a nice feature set also.
B00023BLV2|3.0|I saw this when it was first released on VHS.  Somehow it's not nearly as entrancing as I remembered it.
0446604844|5.0|I've read a few other books by David Baldacci and enjoyed them.  This book is what I call a page-turner.  I enjoyed the read and the character development.  I'm not one to tell the story when reviewing a book, no need.  I plan to look to see if the character Lee Sawyer is continued in another story.  This book made me think about the role those in law enforcement play in our lives and how their lives are effected by their efforts.
B004ASNG04|1.0|I was expecting something more solid and serious than what the book offers. I have to say, some of the reviews on the book misled me.<br /><br />If you, as a reader, grow up in the West, being taught from the very beginning on the source of power the West possesses with a traditional point of view (e.g. the idea of equality, freedom, the impact of Christianity, democratic institutions, etc.), you may find the argument by Morris somehow refreshing and interesting.<br /><br />However, if you have lived on the other side of fence, as I do (I lived in China for 29 years before moving to the West), you will find the book somehow familiar, which reminds you the brainwash you had been subjected to when you were in China. Ideas don't count; personalities are accidents; the ultimate driving force of history is blind economic movements, or, anything that is materialistic, or, a better term, scientific, which may be geography, biology, physics...<br /><br />I suggest if you read this book alongside with Vishal Mangawadi's The Book that Made You World, you would be better served with opposite perspectives and approaches to the same issue. Interestingly, may I add, the book was written by an Indian scholar, who lived on the both sides of the fence.
0385536828|2.0|Sweet Tooth  by Ian McEwan<br /><br />In Sweet Tooth Ian McEwan has used lots of lovely words and strung them together in lots of lovely ways. Unfortunately this does not make a lovely story. It is in many ways a deadly bore. To say that Sweet Tooth is tedious is an understatement. There are too many incidental characters and incidents that have no relevance to the story as red herring or plot line or character development. Perhaps what McEwan really wrote was a very good short story when what he (or his publisher) wanted was a novel. Is the writing good?  Yes. Does that make me like this book? No. I finished the book, but I didn't enjoy it. This is the first Ian McEwan book I have read. I doubt I will read another.<br />This novel may have been a very good short mystery or short romance. It just doesn't work as a longer novel. The main character - Serena Fromme - is, to put it quite bluntly, an unlikeable twit. Unfortunately for the reader she is surrounded by more unlikeable twits, self-absorbed males, pompous asses and other assorted denizens of Cold War London.  Unlike Serena I actually enjoy the process of reading. I like to savor the characters, imagine the outcome of the plot, thrill at the word usage and become involved with the unfolding of the story. The one character I DID like was Shirley. I wanted to know more about her - why she left MI5, how she came to become a successful beauty, why she made such a generous offer to Serena, her interactions with Max and Tom..... Yet Shirley was given little to do except tie up loose ends in a most unsatisfactory manner.<br />I found some of the structural parts of the book to be annoying. First I HATED the occasional italic phrases. They were simply a distraction.  I also found the insertion of Tom's current works annoying. They were too long and detailed. Although both of these were explained in the last chapter, it did not help me in the actual reading enjoyment of the book.<br />I have thought about recommendingSweet Tooth to another. First, no one should ever recommend a book without first reading it cover to cover.  In recommending this book I would feel compelled to state why I didn't like it.  Secondly, I would only recommend this book to someone who was also a voracious reader and one who was willing to devote many pages before disbanding reading.  Thirdly, I would NOT say this was a spy novel, or a romance, but instead present Sweet Tooth as a demonstration of literary devices.<br />I might toss Sweet Tooth into the mix of possible book group choices (we usually choose our 10-12 books from a group of 20-24 books recommended by members who have already read them). We have chosen books in the past that were only lukewarm in their recommendation.  It often makes an interesting discussion as members tell why and what they didn't like and how they might have changed the book.

B003VANOFY|5.0|There are a lot of reviews so I doubt I willa dd anything new other than share my experience.  I came from nice Seinhauser wired headphones that I kept catching on my chair/desk etc.  I am really happy with these - the first time I had them on the sound was so good, I thought I had set them up wrong and my speakers were actually on, not the ehadphones.  When I pulled them off my jaw dropped that it truly was the headphones - I found the sound that good.  I have had a couple of split second drops but absolutely nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Great sound and great for movies/gaming and music.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Totally in love with the show! The package came speedily and the box it came in was secure. Couldn't ask for me.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This upgrade should be part of any Maglite flashlight. They were finicky to get working at first but they are rock-solid now.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is super fun. I don't go on my fire a lot, but when I do, I'm always on Temple Run or pinterest. I would reccomend this app to anyone who enjoys quick moving games. Bye Bye ; p
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|this was an excellent movie and i could watch it over and over again.. i was asked to watch this by a friend of mine and then i wanted to by it for myself and i shared it with some friends of mine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very addictive..love how its easy then gets  progressively harder.  my family is liking it also. great game. glad it was created
0385344333|1.0|Just plain awful, stupid, stupid. I am (was) a great fan. How this book came about is a mystery. Well I guess with a midget Tom Cruise playing a giant Reacher Lee Child sold out. Read the other books and burn this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love the game. Only as few minor problems with it. First it is a kids game that's fun fir the whole family but  you're asking too much of the kids to be able to get That much $ so quickly after just learning the game when it comes to the  expansion of the village. It starts  off free to expand, then you want $10000!! Too much!!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Oh goodness I heart this app!! It does everything rd supposed to. Want more choices for this app? I would recommend the .99 cent app.<br />Stay awesome.<br />Hawk Flight of RiverClan
B005ZUR724|5.0|Great for people who enjoy playing mmorpg games or WoW and etc... It is also great for people interested in a new type of gaming.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was truly and enjoyable reading. The pace was great and it kept me engaged though out I recommend this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the first and only alarm app i have ever used.  Excellent app, has never failed to wake me up At the desired time
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I kind of lost faith in the Batman Franchise until this film! It was so good, that I would definitely watch it again. So many surprises kept me guessing till the end. Must See!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Oh my gosh, my children LOVE this movie - and I do too! I'm an eco-conscious girl, so the heart of this film makes me smile, but it's the songs and characters that I fell in love with. My kids adore the fun, catchy tunes and always get up to dance - okay okay, I do too! Seriously, the songs in this film are too fun. This is sure to be a favorite for any child (or child at heart) :)
1423140605|5.0|The book marks the third in the series and for the price you are getting a rather large, hardback book.
B002VECM6S|5.0|There's something amazing about a movie that can make you feel good and inspire you as well. This is one of those films!
B005LAIHGI|1.0|I can't really rate this movie since I could never watch it!  I ordered this DVD with many others, but it would never work even after trying it on 2 different DVD players.  Since I am stationed overseas, it is not worth the hassle to go through the return procedure, but I am pretty disappointed that I paid for nothing, and even more disappointed that I can not watch the movie that I have been waiting on for over 3 weeks.<br />In all fairness to Amazon, I have been overseas for many years and order from Amazon often (they are the lifeline to America for many people overseas), and I have never really had any other problems with them.<br />Oh well, I guess I will buy it somewhere else when I visit the states next year.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What's more to say? These movies are amazing and I am so excited to have this set for my family, especially at such a great price.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|It's a nice little program from the little I've used it but it needs a few good, fun songs to entice people to buy the full version.  I'm not there with the available songs.  :(
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another great season! I wont give anything away, but mid-winter break is going to be tough without the WD this year.
B001QWBM62|3.0|After shopping the portable, digital recorders,  decided to try this one on the advice of engineer friend. Set up and ops are easy. I recommend taking your time to familiarise yourself with the recorder and reding the manual before using it. Over all, it is a nice little recorder but there are some quirks. Built in mics work well but recording can clip easily, even with the auto level on. Plugging in a separate cardioid or condenser mic works well but levels are much lower for some reason. Not sure I'd use auto level though many field news people do. If you're careful, I think you'll get better results using manual level control but it can get tricky. The unit comes with the a.c. adapter which is nice to have in case you run your batteries down, which can happen fairly fast. We liked the xlr/phone plug input. The speaker is okay enough to check your recordings but using with headphones gives you a much clearer monitoring and playback of your recording. The audio was not as good as some units like it, particularly the Nagra but it costs a great deal more. We thought it was a little better than a toy, as some describe. Versatility opens the door for some cool field work and you can do some fun stuff with it. Bottom line: If it were more expensive, you will want something a little higher end, otherwise it's good for a lot of jobs and even at home or in the studio. This is not a high dollar studio recorder, nor does it cost like one. I'd recommend it for small stuff.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive and keeps me awake when I am up at 2am feeding my two month old!  The first levels are really simple but it gets more challenging once you get to the 7x7 and 8x8 levels.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This prequel to &#34;Spartacus: Blood and Sand&#34; is very compelling and has much better action sequences than it's predecessor.  It is unfortunately shorter than the other seasons, but it is a quality buy.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|If you've crossed the Rubicon, Homeland is on the other side. Damien Lewis.  Mandy Panikin. Claire Danes. A spook bandess of brothers.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This is by far one of the best series to come from television and (in my opinion) is the best season of the whole series.  The blu-ray looks stunning and Andy Whitfield portrays a great Spartacus.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Got it for 19 bucks - 3D version and worth watching for the 3D effects if not a worthy storyline. Good to spend a cold afternoon with your kids
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a huge Reacher fan, I've read every book, and fully looked forward to this one coming out.  It did not disappoint.  I can't see how Tom Cruise will pull off being 6'5&#34;/250 lbs, but will go see the movie and find out.  Great twists and turns through this book, more mystery than the past books.  Well worth it!  I almost wish I didn't read it, so that I could read it again!
B005LAII08|3.0|I did not like it - usually Disney - Pixar movies are good, but this one put us all to sleep.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|Very good browser.  Makes the tablet work more like the desktop while browsing the internet.  Much better than the app included with the tablet.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|hilarious love this book .!<br />funny and existing best book I ever read from Jeff Kinney and best diary of a wippy kid yet. 5stars this book deserve it .
1609611543|5.0|I was not really overweight but a sugar addit. I have only been on it three weeks and have lost 3 pounds. It is hard for me but will be worth it in the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even better after you've watched the movie it followed it really well that's all I nav  today but it's making me write mors
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I went on the old Atkins years ago and felt sluggish and nauseous most of the time. This New Atkins is much more liberal and is easy to do with family and work. I've lost 8 lbs in the first 2 weeks but only wanted to lose 15 total. I'm half way and feel like I could stay on this for life. Worth the effort!
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a fun game if you like this type of game. It is slow to start but gets busier as you grow your kingdom.
0345803485|1.0|IT WAS ABOUT THE DUMBEST BOOK I READ. A FRIEND RECOMMENDED IT. HE'S NO LONGER MY FRIEND IT WAS ALSO POORLY WRITTEN.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love watching ice age with my sons, now we can play together. Super easy to play perfect for my 6 yr old.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a classic book. Emily Bronte has taken a love story and put her own twist on it. If anyone had studied the book in High School will tell you, the irony is simplistic. I loved it back then, and after reading it again I loved it even more. There were things I didn't understand back then that made more sense. Since I've been married for 20 years now, I understand the meaning of true love. Read it again if it has been so long, reanalyze it and decide for yourself.
B004XIZN5M|3.0|I bought this book on a recommendation, and I have to say I am overwhelmed with the quality of the content. The justification &#34;Coach&#34; Wade uses for his exercises, as well as the step-by-step process for the progressions is great reading, and a well designed workout. However, using Kindle to download this book was not the best medium. Several of the pictures depicting the steps for the exercise were not included in the download; same for many of the progression standards for the different exercises. This is critical information when planning your workout.  Much of it is available on-line, but for $20, it should be in the download!<br />Bottom line: this book is full of valuable information, but until the download is fixed, buy the paper version.
B000V9CSIM|4.0|For those who complain (and I used to be one of them) that no one knows how to write songs nowadays, I mention Whiskeytown/Ryan Adams. Definitely more &#34;poppy&#34; that his usual, but that's not really a bad thing since the lyric chops are still right there.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have seen and read so many parodies and spoof on this story that I finally decided to read the original story. I was worried that it would take me a while to read because I've heard the story so many times and older books are usually a slow read for me, but I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself finishing this in a day and wanting to give other Charles Dickens books a read. Loved it. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it and my kids love it also! thanks again amazon, ur are the best! and its free! thank you
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Chevy and Crew make this a all time classic!  Our family have made this a yearly part of Christmas season.

B00633W614|5.0|I fell in love with Jeffrey Archers writing when I was 12 and read Kane and Abel (for the first time).  In the 32 years since then he has never let me down.  Picking up a book by Archer means I will be unavailable for anything else until I've finished the last line.  The Clifton Chronicles had me hooked from the first line and I am only sad that I will have to wait until March 2013 for the next installment, Best Kept Secret.
B005DZMODI|4.0|Mi aspettavo meno swing, ma il Cd è molto orecchiabile. In alcuni pezzi Clapton sparisce tra i fiati, ma la tromba di winton è uno spettacolo.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I  found this book to be an honest telling of one unique man's struggles, frailities, courage, determination and above all triumphs. I would recommend this story to those who enjoy nonfiction accounts of extraordinary people such as Adam Brown, who met life's major challenges with determination and bravery. It is not only a tale of a Navy Seal, but, also of a life well lived and the legacy of loyalty, joy and friendship for all those who knew and loved him.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Sempre all'altezza, anche se non uno dei migliori degli ultimi anni. Un pò monotono, tante ballate di ottimo livello, ma poche deviazioni folk/rock.

B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is a worthy addition to any Kamelot fan's collection, or if your into Conception (Roy Khan's previous band), Queensryche, and Symphonic Power Metal with Progressive touches, this is for you.... Materially speaking, this release covers their most recent release (at the time, and widely considered, their best, The Black Halo) along with songs from earlier releases such as Epica, and Karma. The band (Thomas Youngblood, Oliver Polotai, Glenn Barry, and Casey Grillo, are in top form) with guest appearances from Simone Simons (Epica) on The Haunting, and Snowy Shaw (Therion) on March Of Mephisto, along with the Star, of the show, lead vocalist Roy Khan (who turns in, a truly unforgettable, emotional, operatic, performance) Truly an Amazing Achievement!!!.... PS, Just when I thought they were done, due to the departure of  lead singer, Khan, after the Poetry For The Poisoned album, they've found a worthy successor in Tommy Karevik (of the equally impressive Seventh Wonder, a band also worth checking out) and released Silverthorn, a true return to form..
B000002ITW|4.0|Il secondo cd è il top del country rock. I pezzi firmati da Neil e steven sono i più orecchiabili, ma anche le ballate di Crosby e Nash sono....da meditazione
B007HACDLK|5.0|Enough testosterone to fuel an aircraft carrier, but that is why we follow the exploits of the un-killable super CIA agent Mitch Rapp! Another winning entry by Vince Flynn.  As with any of these super heroes whether they be Dirk Pitt, Jack Reacher, or Jason Bourne, don't get mired down searching for reality; just ride the wave of non-stop action (maybe a slight slowdown during the concussion episode)and plenty of plot twists & turns as Mitch beats up on the Middle East as well as some CIA traitors. You go boy!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I watched this movie with my 8 year olds and we LOVED it!  It really held their attention and got them to connect with the characters.  The movie had a great moral lesson as well.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After two books of being led on by little to no plot line, I expected a lot more from this book. I thought the conflict involving Jack Hyde would be more thoughtful and planned out, but it added very little to this book about 50 sex acts everyone knows a out. I would not recommend these books to anyone.
0547884591|5.0|Throughout history the world has known many great artists that have intrigued, shocked, wooed, titillated, and even questioned the minds of man and woman. Picasso, da Vinci, van Gogh, Raphael, Timothy Ferriss. The 4-Hour Chef is a plethora of substance with phenomenally captivating delights front to back. Jokes aside and in all seriousness...get this book.
044042321X|5.0|The book was shipped very fast and came to me in perfect condition! I'm a little disappointed that I didn't realize this novel is only a fraction of the first book. My fault though I guess.

B009NUV0E8|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo34NV9KOQD9IKB]]A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of Goldeneye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board.<br /><br />While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly.<br /><br />It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation.<br /><br />The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But Goldeneye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a travesty. When the Special Edition DVD came out in 2006 it was in the wrong aspect ratio, with picture cut off at the sides. Fans were not pleased. So when it was time to produce a Blu-ray, instead of doing a Lowry restoration like they did for EVERY other Bond movie released on the format they decided to go back to the high-def master used for the 1997 DVD (HD masters did exist back then, but only for studio use), in fact I wouldn't be surprised if this is even the same master used for the 1996 Laserdisc. But to make it look more modern they have applied a criminal amount of digital noise reduction, turning the movie into a waxy mess. Shots that scream out for fine detail come across as a 90s CD-ROM cut-scene. Make no mistake, this is a DVD in Blu-ray clothing. It's ghastly! The sound fares better in DTS HD-MA, and there are plenty of extras, but the video quality kills it.<br /><br />MGM should initiate a replacement disc policy. GoldenEye needs to be remastered properly and given away free to people who were suckered into buying this frisbee. Make no mistake, it's one of the worst Blu-rays I've seen.y.

B004IB0N0E|5.0|Wow! Stratovarius, along with other bands in the power metal genre, are one of those bands that just keeps on going as a result of the fact that making great artistic music is their sole passion in life, and that they are proud of everything they do.<br /><br />I have enjoyed every song on this album from start to finish, and I have to say that, despite it being the second album without Timo Tolkki, it is a masterpiece in its own right, and anyone who appreciates their earlier masterpieces definitely owes it a listen, along with its predecessor, Polaris. Again, the music found on this album is a bit different from albums like Visions or Destiny, but just like with Polaris, it still possesses the everlasting heart and soul of those earlier albums. Again, they provide the listener with a balance between up-tempos and steady ballads.<br /><br />Songs such as \\"Darkest Hours\\" and \\"Under Flaming Skies\\" perfectly illustrate and reinforce with fast, yet soulful, emotion that Stratovarius are known for, while others such as \\"Lifetime in a Moment\\" and \\"Move The Mountain\\" reinforce the steady, haunting dark beauty that characterizes much of their more steady-paced ballads. For obvious reasons, I often describe Stratovarius to common people in America as \\"Metallica meets Journey.\\"<br /><br />Another thing to note is the title track, which is not only the big long epic on the album, but, at over 18 minutes in length, is also the longest song that this tremendously talented band has ever recorded. From start to finish, it is worth every minute of the listen, no questions asked. It definitely matches up to what bands like Symphony X or Rhapsody of Fire would be proud of, and Stratovarius definitely hold their own.<br /><br />Given how much of a punch that this album packs, along with Polaris, I am very excited for the release of the next album, Nemesis, which is to be released this next February. I am more than certain that it will be as amazing as this one, knowing amazing Stratovarius are in general. With exception of their self-titled album, they have ruled at every level with everything they have done. They are one of the best bands in the last 25 years, no questions asked. They just WILL NOT let up, and they never stop making great music.<br /><br />Definitely buy this album if you enjoyed Polaris. Any true Stratovarius fan will definitely appreciate it for the amount of work that was put into it, and will not down it. STRATOVARIUS FOREVER!!!!!! \m/\m/varius are in general.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really cool. There are really no limits to what you can create. I have created things from a hotel to a castle.  If you are really creative this is the game for you. This is NOT a waste of money. Minecraft is really really really really really AWESOME!!!!!!
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh out loud, and I watched it by myself (which tends to incur less laughs than the shared joviality of watching it with a friend). Emma Stone is cute and funny and believable; not once did the thought of her merely acting out the part cross my mind while watching this. When I took a little break in the middle of watching this I found myself smiling and in a better mood just from watching it; then again, I am a strange child. The last third is more serious but it ties up the ends well.<br /><br />But set your expectations a tad bit lower so you'll enjoy it more :)
B0061PEAUY|1.0|Very unusual to not be able to finish .... but this book is too technical and not enough story or characters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is well done. It covers more than the basic premise of the show, as it looks into human nature in times of duress.
B007M45XL8|5.0|Dr. John has always been one of the more unique voices in the industry. Enjoyed this release very much. Tipping point was Dan Auerbach's production and guitar playing on the album. Several good songs on here and rightly deserves it's status on critic's lists of best albums of the year.
0307474275|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. The story takes place in Europe and has a lot of action, drama and mystery in it. It's one of the greatest books ever written.

0525953728|3.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is an autobiography of a Navy Seal, Mark Owen; a pseudonym for an actual participant of the Navy Seal force who was charged with the mission to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />The story chronicles the exploits of Navy Seal Team Six, its members, and their deployment to various critical situations as they arose in the world theater. It is a chronicle of the life of \\"Mark Owen\\" as he recalls his participation as a seal team leader whose ultimate quest is finally realized in the mission to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />The book is generally interesting, from the perspective of the look into the life of a Seal and the logistics, failings and rewards of the mission that eliminated Bin Laden and also other targets. If anything was missing, it was a distinct feel that the story was thin. It chronicled the missions but failed to draw the reader into the action - the story was too sanitized, even unexciting. There seemed to be a great opportunity for a thriller novel; it did not materialize with Kevin Maurer's writing about Mark Owen.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to like this account, it just didn't capture me.  When you finish reading the book you won't feel like you know anymore about \\"Mark Owen\\" than when you started; except for a little of Mark's politics perhaps. You also come away with the distinct impression that the success or failure of a mission is a coin toss; the extensive training only gets the odds to 50-50. As Owen points out on several occasions, if the target had been a well trained unit like the Seals, the outcome would have been significantly different. That's not to say that the deployment of such a force as the Navy Seal Team Six doesn't have a place in today's violent and incomprehensible terrorist environment, it's just that it comes across as a much less certain outcome than anyone might imagine for all the cost in lives it subtracts.<br /><br />With all of that said, I would reserve recommendation of the novel for your reading list. It is interesting, but not particularly memorable or thrilling.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is the definition of a page turner! I really became invested in the love story between katniss and peeta.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The first 2 books of this series were great.  I wish I could say the same for books 3 and 4.  Book 3 was a terrible let down and this 4th book did nothing to revitalize my interest..  I will not be back for the highly overpriced 5th book.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|The information regarding behind the scenes events, and unreported happenings fills in much of the detail that does not appear in our sanitized history books. Everyone interested in getting another point of view concerning events from our country's past should read this book.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|If you love Fagen, dig right in.  Reminds me of &#34;Morph the Cat&#34; - and for me, that's great.  I just got out of a long stay at the Mayo Clinic out here, and missed the release date.  But, it's in my hands now - and oh, frabjous day! Callooh Callay, absolutely couldn't ask for a better Holidays gift for me.  Once more - love Fagen? Get in NOW. Enjoy.
B0091XRTTM|5.0|My 6 year old really liked this movie.  He loves pirates, but even so I had a hard time selling him on watching the film.  He reviewed the trailer and checked out how many stars it got (that's how he researches a film :) ) and reluctantly agreed to watch it.  Once it started he was hooked.  He watched the whole movie and thought it was funny.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|enjoyed the book - liked that some mysteries you had to figure out on your own. Loved that it was long - I like to spend time on a book and I am disappointed when it ends too soon.
B0018ARN6U|5.0|The great thing about T.Rex is that their style mixes rock, folk, pop, and what some people call alternative so perfectly.  Catchy melodies and awesome lyrics.  Get this especially if you are not real familiar with the band or Marc Bolan.  I suggest this album for the younger kids.  It's an older album but if you have never heard it, it's brand new sounds.
B005UBNL0A|2.0|I used this CPU for about six months before just now moving on to an i5-3570k. First off, this CPU does well for how much it costs. It certainly isn't \\"bad.\\" It just isn't worth the hassle and gives you no room to improve.<br /><br />The AMD FX-4100 delivers when it comes to general multi-tasking and light gaming. However, if you are a gamer, know that it will deliver passable framerates at best in many games. A few examples are Borderlands 2, the Supreme Commander series (primarily, 1 & FA), and Total War: Shogun 2. The chip actually does fairly well in StarCraft 2 with the CPU settings on low-medium, most of the time.<br /><br />However, there is one serious issue with this processor when it comes to Valve's Steam service, where lots of gamers choose to make their home. Some games will suffer painfully hefty framerate losses on FX processors, when they should run smoothly. Others cause blue screens. For example, I was getting 3-10 FPS on Counter Strike: Global Offensive, regardless of settings, using an AMD FX-4100 and GeForce GTX 550Ti.<br /><br />Fortunately, somebody has made a temporary solution to those problems (permanent for some motherboards), which can be found by searching \\"A fix for Valve CEG games causing BSOD on Bulldozer -issue\\" on Google.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this processor just isn't justifiable. If you are already in possession of an AM3+ board, go for the AMD Phenom II x4. It is an older chip that still manages to beat the FX-4100 at almost every turn, and comes without the pesky quirks. If you are still choosing a processor / motherboard, I might suggest going for an Ivy Bridge Intel i3 processor. They are roughly the same price and perform on par with, or even better than the FX-4100, despite only being dual-core. Intel's CPU architectures are just vastly superior to AMD's right now. The biggest bonus for the i3 is that it uses LGA 1155 sockets, which allows future upgrades to i5 and i7 processors without replacing your motherboard.<br /><br />If you are willing to spend a little over $200 for it, I would recommend the i5-3570k. It is easily the best CPU on the market for high-end price / performance, and matches the i7-3770k for gaming. The i7 series is better suited for heavy use of hyper-threading. For anything else, the i5-3570k is great. There simply isn't a better option.<br /><br />If you are on a budget, you're better off buying an i3 or the Phenom II x4.<br /><br />Hopefully AMD's Steamroller architecture will make some improvements that will make their chips worthwhile. Until then, Intel gives you more power, more options, and more flexibility.

The detail is fresh and crisp; it's almost like seeing the movie for the first time, except that you do know every line!  Still, you'll notice little things, especially among the Transylvanian guests at Frank N. Furter's party that you'll swear you've never seen before.  And Frank N. Furter looks absolutely smashing for the floor show--he really IS a &#34;wild and untamed thing!&#34;  May the Rocky Horror Picture Show never die!

B00A3XQVKW|1.0|[[ASIN:B00A3XQVKW Embraced By The Light]] Love = truth. Truth does not always feel good, it sometimes is difficult to face.  Truth  does not contradict the Bible the living and active word of God.  This book, Embraced by the Light--and its follow up topics written by Betty Eagle, directly contradict the words of the living God. The Apostle Paul said: Test Every Spirit...this book, when sifted through the New Testament, does not pass the sniff test. It does not even pass the old testament test, when you consider God's conversation with Job. God asked Job, where were you when I shaped the world? ANY BOOK giving a testimony of heaven that DOES NOT bring glory to Jesus Christ is a lie.  Satan, the Bible says, parades as an angel of light.<br /><br />I would like to suggest to all of the NDE folks, to try living a life that glorifies the FATHER--as JESUS has COMMANDED us to: go and make disciples (of Christ), baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teach them EVERYTHING he has commanded.  If you're not going to do that, and are not going to bring us a conversation that brings glory to the Father through our Lord and Savior Jesus Chris, I suggest you stop writing these books.<br /><br />For those of you who lost loved ones--such as I did--my dad and best friend. It is hard, very difficult. But Jesus has already reassured us that HE is the resurrection and the life. No one can come to the father except through HIM.  Everything that happens in your life has already been sifted through the hands of a powerful and loving FATHER--WHO WILL NOT CONTRADICT HIMSELF.<br />This book, Embraced by the light, disregards Jesus' death, burial and resurrection--it disregards the cross of Christ. How can you claim to KNOW THE FATHER and disregard the son?<br /><br />When you tell people it doesn't matter what they believe or do not, or it doesn't matter what they do and so forth--you DIRECTLY contradict the word of God. This book also uses scripture sprinkled here and there--let me remind you all: Satan himself had the nerve to directly approach Jesus and SHOW HIM all of the kingdoms with the attempt to deceive--but it wasn't possible to DECEIVE CHRIST.  It is also not possible to deceive the disciples of Christ. As Jesus said: My sheep know my voice..they will run from false shepherds.sprinkled here and there--let me remind you all: Satan himself had the nerve to directly approach Jesus and SHOW HIM all of the kingdoms with the attempt to deceive--but it wasn't possible to DECEIVE CHRIST.

B008Z7M5IK|5.0|\\"Stand up and Fight\\" is a grand, exuberant album that manages to be dramatic and uplifting without being sappy or trite. The song writing is excellent and the performances - especially the vocalist - are superb. While I can imagine a few fans might be turned off by the difference in sound between this album and prior albums, I feel the basic style is consistent, and furthermore that the execution is far superior. There is no doubt in my mind this is the best of Turisas' first three albums.<br /><br />Turisas' prior two albums were folk-infused metal albums that were typical in their instrumentation - guitars, keyboard, drums and vocals. The keyboards played an important role in the song structure and I especially appreciated the strong use of synthesized horns. While the song writing is quite good on both prior albums, I always felt the synthesized sounds sounded just fake enough to detract from the music.<br /><br />With \\"Stand up and Fight\\", Turisas has added live instrumentation (brass and strings) to the album, as well as more backing vocals. This is a tricky task because it is more difficult to write for a larger and more diverse group of instruments, and also because it becomes difficult to get the recording and mastering quality required to make it work. The result here is a huge success; the electric guitars are present, but never too loud. The horns are loud and clear and the strings fill the background well. While the orchestral elements act as simple backing from time to time, more often they're given a great deal of work to do and in many places carry the song more than the guitar. Turisas has some fantastic writing on this album and it just sounds incredible.<br /><br />The album is fun to listen to. It begins with the straightforward but engaging \\"The March of the Varangian Guard\\", which does a great job of giving the listener a taste of what the band can do. From there the songs mostly get longer and more intricate, culminating in the suitably epic \\"End of an Empire\\". There's a lot of variety in the music; \\"Take the Day!\\" sounds to me like Vikings mugged Queen, while Hunting Pirates is a fantastic blend of metal and folk music. \\"Stand up and Fight\\", \\"Fear the Fear\\" and \\"End of an Empire\\" rely heavily on orchestral work and are more complicated musically and emotionally than either \\"March\\" or \\"Hunting Pirates\\". I personally like almost the entire album, which is unusual, and appreciate both the driving strength of the earlier songs and the intricacies and grand drama of the later ones.<br /><br />Mathias Nygard does his best work yet on the vocals. I remember the earlier albums being more growl and scream than clear voice, but this one is the opposite. And, frankly, the black/death metal growl has become something of an anachronism. It may work on \\"Hunting Pirates\\", but on \\"Take the Day\\" it actually sounds weak beside the backing vocals. Mathias' clear vocals are excellent and in my opinion it's time he moved completely to them, as they can hold their own.<br /><br />Most criticisms I have of the album are suitably small. I love that they rely on horns, and think they could do with even less of the high string (violins). It's a delicate balance being uplifting without being sappy, and they may stray in a few small places. I'd love to have one song as traditionally heavy as, say \\"Cursed Be Iron\\" is on the album.<br /><br />Overall the album exceeded my every expectation. I look forward to the next one.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Shakespeare or really any classic literature will appreciate and enjoy this movie throughly. It takes a short period in William Shakespeare's life and spins a tale that was supposed to have inspired 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Twelfth Night'. While being an enjoyable and somewhat believable piece of historical fiction, the piece is not pretentious and does not seek to sell as fact but lighthearted entertainment.<br /><br />A must-see for sure.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|The longer you worked for a typical large corporation, the more you'll like this movie.  It's sort of a cult film for all of the Dilbert/cubicle people.  Even if that's not your personal history, you'll like it a lot anyway - talk to anyone else who's seen it.
0385484518|5.0|This book is a must read! Short story and can't put it down once you start. Deep and moving, will have you laughing and crying and will make your heart melt. Mitch Albom writes and puts you  in the story as if you were there.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has an had many experiences in his personal life that allow him to bring authenticity to his writing. His novels are always rich with insight into the souls of his characters. Although his stories are not boringly chaste, his story line always is about developing intimate relationships of love and committment between characters that the reader grows more attached to with each turn of the page. I love his work and always look forward to the next Nicholas Sparks' novel.

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Though academic with conclusive hard data driven (rat) research, this book is easy to read and put into practice.  It demonstrates how to inoculate children against failure and gift them the greatest opportunity for success and life happiness. It's not any of the latest and greatest hot brain games, toys, or computers.  Based on Bolby's Attachment Theory, success is driven by parental involvement and simple soothing in times of stress.  It can be practiced successfully by any parent regardless of income or social status.  It is the antidote for poverty.  A good compliment is [...] and author Paul Zak and his work on the Cuddle Molecule—oxytocin.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|I try to give every book a fair shake, but if I'm not interested by the third or fourth chapter I move on to something else.  This one just didn't do it for me but I'd be willing to give some of his other books a try.
184195392X|4.0|Chose this because I'd just seen the movie.  The film pretty much follows the novel faithfully.  Terrific job by director Ang Lee in making a breathtakingly beautiful film of it.  Reading the book won't get you any deeper into Martel's philosophy on God and life, nor will Lee's film, but both are good rides.  If you read/see one, you don't need to see/read the other.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first read this book for a summer class in high school, and I am glad I was introduced to it. It is a great story, especially for teens, but for anyone of any age. The characters are interesting and well developed, the story is relatable, and the book is well written and keeps you reading. This was one of the few books when I was younger that I didn't want to put down, and of of the few that I can still enjoy years later.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I am glad I purchased this book. It was a lot of fun to read about sabermetrics and to get a glimpse of what statistics can do in baseball. In fact, it makes me want to be a fan of Billy Bean.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had been hearing so much about this book in the media and from friends, and eventually I just had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the hype was about. I will say first that it is entertaining, and the topic is unique, at least from the books that I've read. But the fact is it's just not good. It's poorly written, a lot of phrases in the book are very repetitive, and it's so cheesy at times that I'm embarrassed for the fictional characters. That being said it's good to kill time, or as a trashy beach read. Though I will probably regret it, I have a feeling I will end up reading the next one. I have heard that it is better than the first, but I will definitely lower my expectations this time.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This television show is based on my life. I look exactly like Johnny Galicki and I have the same mannerisms as the character. Raj has my birthday, the mom works in fMRI research as did I, I grew up in Arcadia and they live in Pasadena. I want to know which childhood friend is stealing my faux pas and making millions off of me. Plus, I live in OR now which is where Raj went to college. It is just creepy.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Yes, this is full of spoilers, but really the movie is so bad that it doesn't matter...<br /><br />I just wasted two hours of my life.  Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge sic-fi fan.  I loved Alien.  Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies.  But this movie just didn't make any sense at all.  None of the characters were developed.  About half of the crew only appeared on the screen to die.  The \\"science\\" didn't make any sense.  The actions of the characters didn't make any sense.<br /><br />Questions: Why would the biologist run away from dead bodies and then try to play with an aggressive alien \\"snake\\" thing?  How could the \\"engineer\\" DNA match human DNA even though they look totally different?  How could a geologist who just mapped the entire cave system with his probe \\"pups\\" become lost?  Why would the head of the corporation hide on the ship instead of just being honest about it?  Why does no one seem to care to ask why a woman (who just gave herself an emergency C-section) is running around the ship in her underwear covered in blood?  What happened to the characters who tried to subdue Shaw (I'm pretty sure she didn't kill them, but they never seemed to appear again)?  And, for goodness sake, why don't they run sideways when the ship is rolling towards them?  Oh, there are so many more questions!<br /><br />Since this is pretending to be a prequel, let me trace how we get to the xenomorph that we're more familiar with from the Alien franchise:<br />1.  In the beginning of the film one of the \\"engineers\\" swallows a bunch of black dots which then completely destroy his DNA and cause him to disintegrate.<br />2.  Android puts a single one of these black dots into the drink of a human so human becomes infected with DNA destroying substance.<br />3.  An hour later, infected human has sex with another human and she becomes \\"pregnant\\" with...something.<br />4.  Infected man is burned to death, but then reawakens as a transformed maniac zombie that proceeds to kill everything in sight for no reason.  This is never explained.<br />5.  After 10 hours, pregnant woman gives herself a C-section and some sort of alien is pulled out.  (But it's not THE alien!)<br />6.  After another day, this alien manages to grow into a 10 ft long tentacled beast.<br />7.  The alien beast then infects an \\"engineer\\" (who is also a maniac killer for reasons unbeknownst to me) by jamming a tentacle down his throat and enveloping him.<br />8.  An unspecified amount of time later, the engineer's chest bursts open and something crawls out.  Now, finally, we have the xenomorph!  And then the movie ends.<br />Summary: Black dot > human > sexual transmission to another human > alien > engineer > xenomorph.<br />And this makes sense, how?  And don't tell me it all makes sense because there are some fracking Easter eggs or that the storytelling is so deep that it's beyond my comprehension.  Rubbish!<br /><br />Oh, and if you knew an alien race was building up an arsenal and planning to come to Earth to destroy all humans, and you meet one of these aliens and he immediately tries to kill you, would you then decide to go to their planet to ASK THEM WHY?  If she had said: \\"Hey, android head, let's take one of their ships and go kill these crazy aliens!\\" then I could understand that.  But instead she thinks that if she shows up on their doorstep they'll be amenable to questioning.  Seriously.  Ridley Scott should be ashamed.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|This kit comes with pretty much every bit type I've ever run into, in various sizes, in a very complete package.  If everything works as expected, it should be the case of \\"what more could you ask for?\\"<br /><br />However, for me, the driver itself has one issue, which is quite significant in my opinion.  The driver itself is (in my opinion) pretty slippery.  Granted, this is not for your everyday screwdriver use really--it's meant in most cases for smaller scale (electronics) use.  However, when you have a particularly stubborn hard drive screw that just won't come loose, you may need a bit more grip.<br /><br />The rubber \\"rings\\" around the driver appear as if they should offer some additional grip.  And generally, they do.  However, these rings can actually rotate around the driver, which means you could be spinning the rubber rings without turning the driver.<br /><br />I expect that my individual copy of the driver is the issue, not the kit itself, based on many recommendations I've seen online.  I'm planning to apply some sugru to create a grip surface that will not slide or rotate as I use the driver, to rectify this problem.<br /><br />The other issue I've noticed is that the driver doesn't quite \\"snap\\" into the flimsy plastic insert.  (The light colored part under the driver, extension, and bit holders is not a very rigid piece of plastic.)  This is also bothersome, but closing the lid over the kit means it's secure anyway.<br /><br />While it may sound negative, I really do like what this kit provides.  It's just a few small issues that keep it from excellence.  I would recommend getting this (or getting it as part of the Pro Tech Toolkit) if you can live with those minor inconveniences, in case your copy of the kit has the same issues mine does.  I just wish the full toolkit existed when I bought this originally, so I could have had the whole set.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|Rather than simply remake an instant re-play of the highly favored TV show, Dark Shadows, Tim Burton artfully casts the irresistible Johnny Depp as an alluring (except when he bites) sympathetic Barnabas who looks for love & a recovered identity in all the wrong places.<br /><br />In Burton's version, only Barnabas displays human inclinations of remorse, empathy, and unconditional love as he is juxtaposed against dysfunctional (perfectly stereotypical) 1970's characters.<br /><br />Some die-hard Dark Shadows fans were gravely disappointed, as they craved a re-creation of the TV show.  I, too, am a faithful 'Shadows' fan, and absolutely enjoyed the excellent casting and humorous directing in Burton's film.  He presents great on-screen caricatures of the fine actors who brought (TV) Dark Shadows to life by poking fun at their nuances but keeping the drama afloat.<br /><br />Viewers who came of age in the 1970's (when American youth were desperately trying to carve out an identity separate from reality), will appreciate Burton's satirical trip back in time.  Moving quickly, he combines bizarre characters, unrequited love, The Moody Blues, a resonating Karen Carpenter, and Alice Cooper's rock angst - alongside scenes such as a newly resurrected aristocratic Barnabas staring at a lonely unappetizing frozen waffle, and an exhausted Barnabas perched in drapery yearning for sleep (his coffin was blown up).<br /><br />Obviously, Burton's Dark Shadows was not meant to be a generic sequel to the infamous TV show, nor was it was designed to be \\"Shakespearean\\" (on the other hand, Shakespeare's groundlings would probably have loved it).<br /><br />So, if you like Johnny Depp (WHO NEVER DISAPPOINTS) and harmless satire, then you'll enjoy the movie; it's a great chance to join in the fun the actors must have had when making it!<br />Thank you to Amazon for permitting me to post my opinion.

B002VPE1X4|4.0|The case itself is durable and soft. As the name suggests, it is rather basic, with no extra padding or special material which makes the camera feel a bit safer. Nonetheless, the case is great!<br /><br />The only thing that annoyed me was that it was bundled for free with the Canon Powershot SX260. Its reasonable to assume that since Amazon has bundled them together, the camera will fit in the case. But I was pretty disappointed to see that the camera did not fit. Amazon's response to my problem was great, however, so I got the issue sorted out. But I would still expect the bundled items to be compatible with each other, and I was unhappy that they did not in my situation.<br /><br />But, since this is a review for the case, I am not taking off any stars, because the case itself is great, even though I don't use it.

B000VSBX34|1.0|Through and error in address and incompetence with my local post office, I never received this DVD. I did try to investigate on my own and told my friend who ordered it for me that I received it. She really would not know what to do if she had to try to trace it. So I am leaving the matter unattended. I most likely will order again because I wanted this movie and it was a birthday gift to me from my internet &#34;sister&#34;.  If Amazon wants to contact me, I can give them the postal # and claim # for verification. Am a big Beatles fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! A must read! I love that it takes place in my home state of Missouri! This is the second book I have  read by this author and I plan to read more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show.  End of story.<br /><br />The real value is this commercial-free HD streaming for $2.84/episode.  I don't subscribe to cable TV so I'm spending $2.84/week for my TV needs.  This won't last, folks, so enjoy the commercial-free services while they're cheap!
B00003CX8N|5.0|I even visited the address when in London to feel the vibes.  It only lives in the movie, and it is so nice to be able to visit it at will.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love this series.  This next installment is a great addition to the series don't miss it. Mac and Dani face off the Fae in style. Karen Moning has captured the essence of her story line in a terrific new plot that holds the reader's attention to the end.
B004CURZFC|4.0|I thought this was a great movie, and would recommend it, for children over the age of 10.  It had great effects, and a great story line, but I love Disney movies, so for me this was a good move!  The only down fall, of the move, was the violence and bloodshed – not for small children.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|After reading other reviews I decided to use Arctic Silver 5 and I was not disappointed - the reviews were spot on.  I used this on a Dell Inspiron AMD dual core (3Ghz 65w) to quad core upgrade (3Ghz 95w) and with zero burn-in time the temperature remained the same (not expected).  I don't know what Dell uses (milky white) but the Arctic (gray) compound works great -&#62; 79-85F all CPUs idling, and 104-120F under 60-75% load all CPUs.  I don't assume the temperature could get lower after burn-in but it may.  Of course any installation could be botched and your result may differ!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I love the Dark Shadows move; it was a great play off the old TV series!  It would be hard to follow all the jokes unless you have seen the old series, but it is worth going back and watching.  I enjoy seeing how Johnny Depp, can transform into any character, and take over any movie!  Every character of the movie was perfect, and fit their role perfectly – love it!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I can't get it to work on my Kindle HD Fire.  I try to add a location and nothing happens
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Pride and predigest is one of my favorite books and movies, so when I saw this move for the first time, I knew I had to have it!  In this move Elizabeth Bennett the main character trades places with Amanda Price, Elizabeth goes into the future, and Amanda goes back in time…  A great twist on a classic novel!  I would recommend this move for anyone who likes a spin on their classic novels!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Can't wait to finish this book so I can get the next one.  Have a hard time putting the book down
6303534422|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies Disney has made, though people overlook it because it was one of few original concepts they produced in the 90's, or because it's not an action or fantasy movie.<br /><br />This movie shows real emotion between a father and son who are going through the rebellious/growing up stage where the child isn't a little boy anymore. And both sides have to come to terms with what they're trying to hold on to. But in the end they realize that you can be your own person and still be your parent's child at the same time. This film is enjoyable for children and adults alike. I still watch it from time to time, because its message still rings true.<br /><br />I went through that as a kid and now that I'm an adult, I can look back on this movie and how it made me feel about that, and how I understand both sides now ;)<br /><br />And as always, Goofy is hilarious and this movie has its share of amazingly funny moments.<br /><br />As for this particular film being on a VHS tape, I still consider VHS to be a valid format. I have the complete Walt Disney Feature Animation collection on VHS, save for Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, The Rescuers and The Black Cauldron. In either case they're easier to find and much, much cheaper than renewing my whole collection on DVD (or Blu-Ray, which I don't really care for as I actually take care of my DVDs, or have a player)!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books, love all of them.  Stayed up late just to finish a chapter.  Read it at work probably was not a good idea but couldn't put it down
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I think the best part of the books is the structure, in that there really isn't one. It's not meant to be read front to back, but rather based on what interests you. The cooking element of the book so far has been super helpful, and I'm definitely learning quite a bit.
0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is my favorite Hemingway novel. There's something about his succinct style and the details that he chooses to focus on that mesmerizes me. Ashley is an interesting character, and I loved the setting. Paris in the 1920s is fascinating. The bullfighting was kind of hard for me because I love animals. The society around the bullfighting and drinking was interesting for me. I've always been curious how much of this novel was autobiographical and how much was pure fiction. I used to have a Hemingway biography on vhs. I guess it's time to see if it's available on dvd. If anyone knows a good Hemingway biography that talks about whether this book was autobiographical, please comment and let me know.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Good action, good spacial effects, a bit dark in terms of color but it is good.<br />Over all it is good
B009LRE040|5.0|This was much better than expected. This was full of suspense.  I would say that only the brave in heart should watch this movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a wonderful movie and really took the franchise to a whole new level.  The 3D blu ray is awesome because this movie was actually made with this viewing experience in mind. Very enjoyable.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This is a really good movie for us older generation.  A love story musical with hot 80's music.  I rated this high because it brings back the good old days.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater. It was great I give the movie 5 stars. Why so low for the dvd then. Well I tried 2 from Amazon pime, one from walmart, and one from a place called vidio shack before I got a dvd that played the whole way through. The good one came from Vidio shack of all places.<br />The story is simple it takes place in the us after a big war. The capital is in the rocky mountians and our hero is in the smokey mountians. They have a contest each year. As part of the peace treaty each district must send one male and female child to compete in a fight to the death. The winning district gets more food and though the capital has food to spare the districts are starving to death literally. Everyone is forced to watch and if no child offers to go a name is chosen by lottery. Our hero's sister is chosen and she, our hero, volunteers. We then see her dealing with people she hates, knowing that she needs them to live though the games. We see her eyes open to understand others and learn not to hate all the capital's people. Yet she still holds her hate for the game the leaders and all they stand for. Does she fight yes does she win well I'll tell you this much. If you get the wrong dvd you may never know.<br />Thus my bad score.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This was done beautifully to protray a fantastical story line. I talk about this film so much I now have my family hooked.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Totally loved the Fifty Trilogy.  E.L. James wrote a story between Christian and Anna.  I was really sorry that it ended.  I have said on many occassions, that I am going to read them again because I loved it that much.
B008476HBM|5.0|Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Fifty Shaded Trilogy is a MUST!  I don't generally read, but this set was awesome.  I loved the way that the author writes.  I had them all finished in 3 weeks!  That is just unheard of from me.
141659521X|5.0|This is an outstanding book.  Vince Flynn has never written a dull book.  You will not be able to put it down.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I really enjoy reading &#34;true life&#34; books.  This one was not exception.  This was written so well.  Thank you Eric and friends for sharing such a great story.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Creative, amazing graphics, funny, cute and well thought out. Tom Hanks is great and it is easy to identify with the kids in the movie.
0525953728|4.0|Seemed like many other military story lines but with the unusal backdrop of Bin Laden and his relationship to our history. Book seemed like a good screenplay but not a great work of historical literature. A good read if you want to see how this all went down. These are brave people!
B008UG0IS0|5.0|I just received Hiromi Uehara's new CD &#34;Move&#34; and this trio is fantastic. (I also have Hiromi's previous CD &#34;Voice&#34;) This CD pushes the boundaries of jazz music and takes things to a new level.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Love the product, but it was a little scratched when I received it. It is just as it is advertised.
B004MSWLU8|4.0|Really good book!! I rate it a 4 because it has some writing in it! But other than that, it was in great condition!
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|I tried to give it 5 stars because I loved it . Gave a great example of the pure voice she has
B009LMBVTW|5.0|OK- it is recorded on an old Norelco cassette recorder and gets a bit fuzzy but it is by far my favorite VU live performance across the output of this particular quartet. I had it on vinyl years and years ago with only 5 of the songs here. The performances are powerful, spellbinding,and more deeply delivered than 1969 or Max's and the guitar solos are unique to this date. I about jumped for joy when I found this and if you love the VU, you just might too!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet - you need to! It has been added to our list of Christmas Classics we watch every year. It is funny, sweet, and very heartwarming. Everyone in my home young and old loves this movie!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|i don't know how they get this on commercial TV every week, but, this show is awesome in the gore they d show. it is all about the zombies...and oh yeah, there are a few human survivors trying to make it to the next day. nobody has said what caused the dead to rise up, but they only way to kill them is a shot to the head. this takes George Ramero's Night of the Living Dead one, maybe two, steps further
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it only shows the First 10 or so stories. it has a little loading sign under that, but it never loads them...so annoying. the fact that i don't have access to nice apps makes me Want an ipad.
B003WUYP56|4.0|Dr. Smolin is one of the few scientists willing to acknowledge his, and his field's, Inadequacy. Thirty to fifty years without significant validating progress is a severe indictment. I admire his candor and vision in advocating going back to foundations. I suggest he go back even further, to ask why quantization? To find the model.<br /><br />To accept quantization without a reason, without applying technology not available to Bohr and Einstein, is to ignore the human nature to make errors. A tiny error in 1925 could propagate over many additive theories, leading to impossible leaps of ill-placed imagination, misleading hundreds of researchers to meaningless conclusions.<br /><br />If you read one serious book about science,let it be The Trouble With Physics. If you've read several extolling science, you especially need to read it. Read the negative reviews to see the reaction of scientists who won't see the troubles with physics. In the last flew pages, Smolin hints at a solution,but misses a bit. Others may find the secret.  Great read.<br /><br /> Paul Lecoq
0525478817|5.0|Mr. John Green how did you win my heart yet at the same time shattered it into smaller pieces? Care to explain? Because I'm currently having \\"can't-get-over-it\\" syndrome. Okay, so much for that melodramatic act. Now let's talk about The fault in our stars and on how it affected me, aside from breaking my heart.<br /><br />The Fault in our stars was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! In simplier terms it was extraordinary and unbelievably fantastic. I know I'm a little bit late to discover it's magical presence but it's never too late to read a good book, right? Also, it was a little bit sad to be left behind you guys. I feel like I'm an outcast in the blogosphere for not reading this book. But right now I feel really grand because just recently my mom bought me The Fault in Our Stars! I am happy. Haha :))<br /><br />The story is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is sixteen-year-old and was diagnosed with terminal cancer back when she was 13. Due to clinical depression her mother forced her to join a support group where she meets Augustus Waters, who she will fall in love with.<br /><br />Hazel is such a strong-willed character. Despite her passivity in life, which was a side effect of her illness, she still manage to be high-spirited at times.<br />Her sarcasm was an edge of her personality. I like the way she deals with her illness. How I wish An Imperial Infliction was a true novel because I'll definitely be reading it to have a better understanding of Hazel's situation.<br /><br />Augustus is the charismatic, witty, hilarious and very down to earth guy. He's like the contemporary Romeo. With a few slips of pages, this boy made my heart fall for him. His perception about oblivion, life, nobility or the universe itself was very unexpected from a teenager like him. He even uses metaphors.  With that being sad I somehow concluded that illness, more particularly cancer, makes a cancer patient think just like an adult. The same thing applies to Hazel's situationas well. Hazel thinks differently, cleverly and maturely, which makes both her and Augustus compatible despite their other differences. I will never forget Augustus for all he had done. This boy has the biggest heart I've ever known.<br /><br />The love interest was close to insta-love though I'm not a fan of \\"love-a-first-sight\\" books, John Green still managed to pull it off. Their love story was tragic, beautiful, magical and heart lifting. I won't be giving much information because I don't want to spoil the story.<br /><br />Overall, The Fault in Our Stars was a fun, tragic, heart-warming and an inspirational read. John Green has created an ingenious and life-changing literary work that each of us should read. Every second of reading The Fault in our stars was magical and memorable. Kudos to John Green!!
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Creative premise and well-written. A good and easy read. I highly recommend his book &#34;Neverwhere&#34; for a bit darker story.
B004SBX112|1.0|this is a very bad game bought it then it would not let me play it.fool not get this game.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|First of all, I'm a die hard Dylan fan so I have a bias.<br /><br />Dylan can sing Chicago Blues riight along with the best of 'em.<br />The &#34;Titanic song&#34; is a bit of a stretch. (worst song on the alblum)<br />I like the rest of it though.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I find the kindle reader good for kindle format books. There are a few things I would like to see improved such as being able to change the background and font colors. For all other ereader formats I prefer Aldiko.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Ok, first to clear things up, everybody that has given this a 1 star rating is complaining about the Ultraviolet copy. If you don't care about the Ultraviolet copy, and only care about the bluray movie, then don't hesitate to pick this up!! The Dark Knight Rises movie itself is easily 5 STARS.
B006O6F932|3.0|Such a cute idea that could have been something great! My daughter got this for her birthday and after we spent an hour putting it together with no instructions, we realized it wasn't as great as we thought. It is absolutely the cheapest made doll house we have ever bought, and trust me she has a lot! It is so flimsy and the dolls aren't able to sit well on the desks and table bench. She has literally played with it 3 times max!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This is a readable book and gets you motivated. I was pretty excited when I saw that a complete indie author was so successful without any help whatsoever. It gave me hope. That's what this book is about. It gives you hope, this COULD be me too. When I first read this book I was impressed, but not ravingly so. There were some gaps in the process. He said his book took off basically from his contacts and friends he made on twitter. That was the defining catalyst.Not being part of the twitter-arti crowd, I wondered would my twitter friends tweet so much about me that I would become a 'million book download' author. Sadly this turned out to be only partly true. I have read on many blogs that John paid for about 300 5 star book reviews. By now I'm sure it doesn't matter. As he was a marketing person, I think, he would just see this as a clever marketing tactic. He would not be the only one to use it, I'm sure. Hats off to John overall for making a sucess of his self publishing venture. I have to admit, I am a little jealous and would love his success. But will I pay for book reviews? Nah.

B008OOYALE|3.0|This is extremely addicting and in time you will be tempted to use money. Ten bucks here and there add up. Mostly time is the the greatest draw on your wallet because everyone wants results. All dragons accept for diamond can be breed from first or second generation red green and yellow dragons all you need is patience. A lot of it. Three of each makes all the dragons you want.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|Love the series can't wait to get season 3 if it ever ships! However its marked new never opened in the description yet 2 of the disks have smudges and 1 had a bad scratch that required taking to have repaired to be viewable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love how many options this free app has. it looks awesome as well and you can modify it to your usage.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I read this book in July and I still remember it.  I don’t remember all the details or even the characters’ names, but I can see their images in my mind’s eye, and I remember the impact this chilling story had on me.  It is a novel about survival, power and love.  It exposes the warped mind and actions of a hypocritical and inhumane dictator who brainwashes and manipulates an entire country.  The setting is North Korea and South Korea.  One is the antithesis of the other in every way.  One is free; the other thrives under a severe caste system.  One is a country of beauty and plenty; the other is a country of poverty and devastation.  The plot which spans several decades is complicated, and some of the events are recognizable, such as confrontations with the United States.  The characters are believable and some are actual historical, political figures.  The organized cruelty of the upper class left an indelible impression on me of man’s inhumanity to man, and I felt the pain of the oppressed as they struggled to survive “by any means necessary.”  A must read novel but not if you have a weak stomach.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|Este libro tiene un serio problema, en vez de la palabra \\"and\\" aparece el simbolo \\"&\\". Realmente lamentable, no pude pasar del primer parrafo. No entiendo como Amazon permite este tipo de errores en sus publicaciones.

B0099G4Y26|5.0|I love P!nk! This album is awesome!!! I like the balance of fast beats & slow songs. She is awesome.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I have a Blu-ray player home theater set-up, so of course I have seen the less-than $10 Blu-rays out there of this movie. However, the cheap-o discs do not feature any special features, such as the extended version of the 1st film. This alone, was good enough reason to purchase this collector DVD set. Anyway, I only have a 46&#34; monitor, so the picture still looks great in the standard definition. Maybe one day MGM will release a proper Blu-ray collector set.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Works great after paired with your headphones.  I often have to go through the turn-on-pair process several times to get my LG wireless bluetooth headset and KOKKIA to hook up. Annoying. Otherwise, sound quality and IPOD controls work well. I'd give it 5 stars if the pairing process worked every time.
B000067FP8|3.0|It had been so long since I originally saw this movie, I wasn't sure I'd even seen it until viewing my recent DVD purchase from Amazon. This movie is all about mayhem and pandemonium caused by the Gremlins, much more rude and crude than I remembered. Lots of gross gags and innappropriate noises at every transition of the film.<br /><br />I had read so many reviewers stating this movie was better than the original, I decided to buy it, it was so cheap.<br />Kind of embarassing to watch, very much so, actually. In a nutshell, writing a good story took a back seat to blowing up Gremlins in a microwave oven.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Awesome book, haven't been that enchanted by a book in a while. Didn't put it down once I started. now for the rest.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Made the mistake of watching this on demand Standard definition, what a disappointment in picture quality.<br /><br />I will need to view this again before slamming the movie. I love stop-motion animation films, and this was done very well, with good voice talent. Just got a little long-winded in the wrap-up sequence. Had some laughs, it was good.
B009GED3HS|3.0|It's OK but I don't like it as much as I liked the previous seasons. I don't know if it is me or the guy who writes the story but I've the feeling that one of us is kind of getting tired.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Just love the production quality of this film. With the accent on basic primary colors, and great wardrobe, the comic pages gumshoe is brought to life in a wonderful manner. Warren Beatty is on top of his game here, as are all other gangster thugs and dames, as well. Madonna is just gorgeous and delivers her character without a flaw. I love it.
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|This is a great album with a really strong classic theme - Zaz has the vocal skill of great singers like France Gall or Cœur de pirate but in a more pure form.

0307592731|5.0|You're whisked into another world in the opening chapter, then into other worlds and lives and experiences... one building on the next....  Strayed is effortless to read, her writing grabs you with its vividness. I actually put the book aside (on my iPad) for several days and read another book so that I would not finish the book too quickly... I wanted to save and savor it and was sorry when it ended... the sign of a great book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Finally some common sense and lots of researched based claims in a book on health/diet.  I've been following this wheat-free plan for a bit over a week and already see a positive change.  The only negative is weight, and that's a great thing.  I'm 8 lb. lighter, much more energetic, and my daughter remarked how much better my skin is looking.  This way of eating is liberating, not restrictive at all. I am not doing anything wacky to lose pounds, not elminating any major food group. Thank you, Dr. Davis!  I'm looking forward to your cookbook.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like the different parenting roles between mother and father.  They both love their son and want to protect him, but have different perceptions of the son they raised together.  Great story of how far will you go to defend your child no matter the cost.

B0084U0IEG|1.0|I was so excited to get this book because the reviews were great. I only got half way through the book and just gave up. It was the worse book that I have read in years. Please do not waste your time on this one.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love it. It is fun and exciting to play. It lets you fly a jetpack and that is awesome.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|If you lived through these presidents, which I did, it makes a lot of history come to life and make sense. If you are not as old as I (few remain) it behooves you to catch up on how presidents and their predecesors and successors made the history of the XX Century. Get the book, enjoy it and go back in history to make the most of it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I like it but it needs more levels and boxes for the holidays. I play this with my brother and sister.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Larson's imagination, his writing (and obviously the excellent translation - my Sweedish is rusty) make this book a perfect delight. If you still haven't read the third part of the trilogy - The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest - you are missing a great book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like how it doesn't need wi-fi so I can go any where and play it. But you need to up date it more.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Don't start this book if you have to go to sleep early. It's full of surprises, the plot is flawless. Grisham is far from being out of ideas, and his writing is a feast for the eyes.

B002LMV7TS|5.0|this is the best grinch movie ever because of the singing and the way the jim carey was protraited in the movie. execellent in all ways. must see movie.
B004BSFC46|5.0|My baby loves looking at these rattles because of the contrast. They are the perfect size and not flimsy like other ones out there
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Quick read, easy, fun, I loved it. I loved the movie also, not bad for it $2! I say read it!
B005UKI1EW|4.0|Andrea may be the world's best singer.  While it was difficult for me to appreciate some of the songs (particularly in Italian),<br />there were a few that were breathtaking.  The ending was spectacular.  You can't go wrong with this Blu-ray.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Music is GREAT! Tom Cruise 'rocks' it. I was pleasantly surprised at the way the actors actually sang the songs. Bought the soundrack too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|better on my Galaxy 7 than on my Droid Incredible 4G LTE phone, because the 8x8 and 9x9 grids start to get pretty small.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is, without a doubt, SK's best work in years. I had a very hard time putting this one down.
1451627289|3.0|At the 50% mark I about lost my mind; I loved the premise, liked the characters, love Stephen King. But good god, this went on and on and on. It became an exercise in frustration. Last night I read until 5am, just to end the damn thing. So, It was good enough for me to bother, but irritating enough I would never read it again. It just needed some major editing; maybe Mr King has reached the point that his editors don't dare to?
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I recievd the movie as discribed and got it in time for the holidays and now I can wrap up my packages of movies going to someone dear to me..
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Batman is my favorite hero because he doesnt have super powers . He is a MAN ( ok hes also filthy rich )But his determination , will and intelligence ( and gadgets ) is his super powers!This movie is good. i wanted more bat toys but all in all its a good movie .I will HIGHLY recomend \\" under the red hood \\" .
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything I could have asked for. A sequel as good as the first. I am going to download the next book as soon as I can.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|If you like match 3 games you will love this one.  Most levels you don't have a problem it's not until you get towards the end.  The blocks keep you from moving some of the tiles.  If the item gets down on top of the block you might as well end the game and start over.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its really fun to do battle and so far its my kind of game. Easy to learn super guidelines and explainations
B0052RCX0G|4.0|The great thing about this book is the short chapters which provide interesting features of the objects photographed.  Although on the Kindle, the details of some of the photos were difficult to see, which was something of a detriment in relating the text to the objects.  Objects from the British Museum, from around the world were discussed.  It is a fun supplement to general historical knowledge and interestingly written.  The only reason for leaving off one star was the difficultly of viewing the photos on the e-Reader.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Hard to put down. If you haven't read any thing in awhile read these books. Great!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer had the pace of The Firm. One of those Grisham stories with twists and turns that keep you wanting to read more.  An exciting read, though a short one.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I love, love, love this book!.....I'm dragging my feet about finishing it because I don't want it to be the end....!  It is so wonderful being able to have this on my smartphone, so I can carry it anywhere and everywhere I go, and I don't have to look for something to read when I'm out!  Many of the facts I have read in other Michael-friendly books, but with so many honors, awards, and accolades, I appreciate being reminded of the King he really was. Truthfully, it makes me smile so many times, being so proud to be a fan now, for the past 3+ years.  I wish I had been following Michael my whole life....I don't believe his story can be over-told, rather, it should be in print on the Best Sellers list, instead of some of this other garbage that has come out by other tabloid journalists....What a shame that many would rather read grossly distorted opinions, rather than black and white established reviews that can be traced back to their unwavering source.  This book may make you cry, because it will touch your very soul, but many are outburts of joy for the man that was/is Michael Jackson.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Don't listen to all these people bashing this headset they are just turtle beach haters. This headset is amazing the first time I shot my gun playing with the headset on I jumped it sounded like someone shot right by my head. The included presets work great and so does the Bluetooth connectivity very simple to set up. I have worn the headset for several hours gaming and it hasn't irritated my head or aggravated me at all. Overall I give this headset 5 stars simply amazing
B0002IQMKM|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. Some of the titles I didn't know, but the CD consists of stuff you've heard on the radio, so it's a good listen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was caught up very early on - very imaginative.  This is not my normal genre of books but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|My favorite of her books, and quite frankly my favorite chick lit book of all time. I've read this over 10 times, and continue to boob when I reach the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just couldn't put this down and couldn't wait to read the next one. I am only sad about one thing I don't thnk there will be a fourth book and this is one of those series that you just don't want to end.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It worked good when I first got it, stopped up dating weather and time?? I also notice no updates available, with so much bad reviews on here you would think the maker of the app would try to fix it.
B005HSL626|5.0|My five year really enjoys this game. She isn't the greatest at it...her timing isn't all that great, but she is only five! Even when she isn't doing that well at it, she enjoys it and asks to play it constantly!
030758836X|3.0|I had a hard time getting into the book.  I almost put it down.  It did pick up and had a lot of surprises.  I then stuck with it.  However, I was very dissapointed in the ending.  I felt bad for Nick.  I really would have liked the \\"villian\\" to get their just desserts.  Also, the ending was very abrupt.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|This was a good concert DVD. Pink is a great artist, very entertaining on stage & she doesn't lip synch which is rare nowadays.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy to navigate through as each step was explained and needed little imagination. Enjoyable and a fast read would recommend for a bad weather day with a hot cocoa.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a classic game. There isn't much else to explain. It's the basic game & it's pretty good at distracting you if you are in a waiting room, etc.
B004JK61K0|2.0|I could never get it to work even though I have set up many email accounts on my mobile and with other apps.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|typical angry bird game. For some reason, I suck at this game but my three kids all love it & they are much better at it then I am. It is definitely good at occupying them if we are at a restaurant or in a waiting room.
B0091QS88K|4.0|This is a fun little game to have to pass the time. There are cool things to do and it is educational in some aspects.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Amazing story..  Very well written, the only other book that I thought was this good was Wool, thankfully there were several of those books out so I could continue reading, not the case here, we must wait for the sequel!  Author, please hurry!!
B000006TSC|4.0|Breathless may have been the first album in which Latimer and Bardens turn their attention to pop songwriting more than anything else (a few seconds into the opening title track reveal concise, short pop-oriented riffs that pretty much pave the mood for the rest of the album), however that's not to say the album is a one-trick-pony; if anything, it tries its best to fit as much of the band's past and present stylistic ideas as coherently as it is able to.<br /><br />Based on a pop format, the band firmly touches base on the styles they're known for, that is, Latimer's own guitar-based prog suites and Bardens/Collins brand of eclectic jazz-fusion, respectively on the songs 'Echoes' and 'The Sleeper', two brilliant gems within the band's catalog. Additionally, there's also a couple of synth-heavy atmospheric songs reminiscent of their 'Snow Goose' sound ('Starlight Ride' and 'Rainbow's End'), all of which add fuel to some of the last sparks of a style they would hardly ever touch upon again after this album, perhaps due to Bardens' upcoming departure.<br /><br />As for the pop songs, they showcase great variety in the band's songwriting despite sharing common ground with that brand of late 70s' radio-oriented music popular at the time, most of which was either disco flavored ('Summer Lightning' could count as their prominent disco single) or smooth jazz fusion. Nevertheless Camel's style of pop always exposed its own quirks too much to enjoy radio airplay; after all, how many songs could you hear on the radio at the time that had prominent oboe riffs or pastoral themes?<br /><br />All in all Breathless stands as an enjoyable compendium of different stylistic approaches by the band, cutting the last ties with past formulas and showcasing more commercialized ideas, nonetheless their sound would be more notoriously affected on their upcoming I Can See Your House From Here album.
0810993139|5.0|This is the second copy I buy. The first was so popular with the kids that finally the pages melt and evaporated. It is a nice book to make younger readers excited with reading.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who asks. Amazon is a great place to buy my music and other items.
1419705849|1.0|The initial funny sense in the previous books is completely gone. This is a bad book written only to make the publisher and author more rich. The worst of all is that my kids asked for this hoping for another funny decent book. Just do not buy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read The Hunger Games, you HAVE to read this book... and of course Mockingjay.  Great story, can't put it down.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love this show, I've gotten every season as soon as they were released on DVD. I wasn't sure if I wanted to get season 5 on DVD or Blu-ray. Once I saw the Ultraviolet Digital Copy I was sold. First time I saw a TV show having a free digital copy with a physical purchase, I love it. I get to watch it on stunning HD and also on my Kindle thanks to the Ultraviolet version.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I purchased this because of the movie,  I wanted to read the book before I saw it.  This book was an easy read and kept me interested!  I finished it in one day!  Now I just have to wait for the movie on DVD as it's not playing in my area :(
0316019984|5.0|My five year old grandson in London was just delighted with this book. Thank you. It was everything that was described.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is just so fun. it really keeps me busy when I need something to do. even though I'm too old for it haha
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game is loads if fun! I definitely recommend it!<br />Just challenging enough to keep you busy for a day or two.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|couldn't put this book done. being instead Rachel's head really made it interesting on how she thought she was normal and going through the stages.
B004GYY714|3.0|the station I listen too stops often, and has to be restarted.  I use this program on my Kindle and am not happy
B002R88G5E|5.0|I could not put this book down. How women are treated in this story is exactly what happens today. Story about love, friendship, family and war truly thought provoking into another place in this world
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|WHAT A PLEASURE TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND DYSFUNCTIONAL AT THE SAME TIME MUSICAL GIANTS OF ALL TIME. THE SOUND WAS CLEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE GUITAR SOLO ON TAKE IT EASY. NICE TO SEE HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's the first game I've downloaded so maybe I'm not an expert. But it's both simple and elegant.  The colors and designs are pleasing to the eye. It needs some skill to match the blocks and requires the player's complete attention. The challenge is always and ever to be better.  It's tempting and entertaining and totally non-stressful. It's just what a game should be.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love it!!! and the price was great!!!!!!!We are going to the concert in houston on March!!!! I love Adam!!!
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Excellent buy for the money. Fits and works great on my snowmobile. Comes with 2 size u-bolts. Easy to install.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|don't buy the software as you can see from other reviews you have to pay 5 dollars for an update after buying it. they think they can push us around cause we are on the amazon market. don't buy<br />BOYCOTT MOBILE SYSTEMS.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love this case, but the screen cover could be more substantial.  :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B008J05EL8|1.0|I shelled out 10 bucks for the software office suit PRO. Do you idiots not understand the word pro, this is a ridicoulous scam that would not fly in the app store. An extra 5 dollars for a font package do you think you can just push us around cause the amazon app store is smaller?<br />I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM MOBILE SYSTEMS I ADVICE EVERY USER READING THIS TO DO THE SAME. You have tarnished your reputation and I highly recommend an appoly to the users of office suit pro.<br /><br />boycott Mobile Systems!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Ever since the first matrix movie came out, I just loved it. I had all the movies on DVD, but as soon as they released the blu-ray boxed set, I had to switch my DVD set for this one. Some SPOILERS if you didn't watch the movies.....<br /><br />The packaging: plain, simple yet very attractive. The box is made of cardboard, with the matrix screen image (letters falling down) at the center.<br />The discs come in separate slim cases, and include the all the 3 movies. The packaging is good, but designed when there were few extremely well-made special edition boxed sets to compare.<br /><br />The movies:<br />This is the definitive edition in my opinion, with great 1080p video and hifi surround sound. The video and sound altogether make you feel like your right in the middle of the action.... A great action movie... And if you're a matrix fan I think it's a must have.<br />As matrix trilogy is kinda old today, most people already know the plot, and I think there's no point in discussing the story, the characters and the fx.<br /><br />The sound:<br />The sound fx are really great.... The surround really makes you feel closer to the action, make you believe you're really there, inside the Matrix. The soundtrack is also fantastic. I think the scores are so creatively placed on the scenes that they help create the mood for whatever is going to happen. I really loved the party song in Zion.... The sound is definitely a blu-ray quality sound and really keep up with the excellent video.<br /><br />Overall:<br />The movies are great !!! The quality is amazing.... Too bad the hero dies at the end....That was not fun.... Anyway, the sound is of superior quality and the package is old, simple, but good looking. I'd totally give it a 5 star overall.<br />I just love this trilogy and its a must-have if you liked the movies.
B009MO5G90|1.0|OH god. 5th part. Why it´s so successful?<br />It has nothing to do with the original Resident Evil!<br />Just because the non-gamers think they can be a part of it and do not check, they just sell the movie under the name.<br /><br />Not the horror from the games. Not the atmosphere.<br />The characters and monsters are totally placed wrong.<br />Even the story is not good, even if the original story is written on wikipedia.<br /><br />And the Alice character is like a porn actress who is a wannabe supergirl and pretend to be cool.<br />In fith element she was cool, but Resident Evil characters has to be mortals, understatement to create horror, not to create action with enemies from a horrorgame.<br /><br />For all movie-people, there is a fact. When the Las Plagas was found in the game, Umbrella was allready destroyed.<br /><br />I thought Uwe Boll makes terrible movies. But even this jerk could make a better Resident Evil.<br /><br />Give the licence to the fans, we make a better conversion!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake, you gotta do the cooking by the book. Or in this case, follow simple directions to publish your book on Amazon.
0099579936|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a story of sex, infatuation and domination. A woman, new to sex, falls for a man who wants to dominate a sub, but seems to also love her. She wants the love part, not the submissive part, but is willing to take both, to continue the relationship. It is the first book of a trilogy, and I hope to read the second and third book, too.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Wish they had a zero rating. This app for the kindle fire hd is really bad. News feed will not load and you can't sync. Please, please update.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I look forward to this show every week! The mid-season finale was very tense. The characters on the show are likable so that's a big plus.
B008PNBU30|4.0|I must admit, I love Three Days Grace. Their first two albums, the self-titled and One-X, were original and amazing, both in music and in lyrics. Life Starts Now didn't quite live up to the high standard set by the first two, but was still good in its own right.<br />Transit of Venus is up there in my favorites. Though there were a few songs I didn't love, I certainly fell in love with Chalk Outline, The High Road, Operate, Give Me a Reason, and Unbreakable Heart. I enjoyed how their sound evolved throughout the years, and I like how it culminated in this album. They went for a lighter, fresher sound, while still keeping the soul of their band intact, and it worked out beautifully.<br />They still managed to convey a message, as in every album. In their self-titled album, it was, in my personal opinion, about breaking free from whomever wants to hold you back. In One-X, it was about addiction and not giving in to it. In Life Starts Now, each song had a different message. And Transit of Venus, in my opinion, is kind of about toxic relationships with others, not just an old girlfriend.<br />Overall, Transit of Venus was a nice bounce back from Life Starts Now and hopefully Three Days Grace will continue to make wonderful albums for as long as they possibly can.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review!<br />~Harpingonforever
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very fun read and sadly very topical given the news of Yemen and drones these days. Look forward to the next book and John's next adventure. Also really want to hear what he said to Tom. :)
B00007BKVC|5.0|You don't want to miss this fine movie.  The acting is great....all the way down to the bit actors..including a younger Brad Pitt.  The story is great...action non stop...amazing what an exciting journey Thelma & Louise embark on.  The ending is just what an ending should be...for this kind of movie.
B0016CTX68|5.0|You can't always get what you want; Midnight Rambler, Monkey Man: What more could you ask for? Classic Stones album
B00008RH3L|4.0|A neat movie...but not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  This movie has some violent scenes...and bloody murders...but the plot is a good one...if you enjoy gangster type movies.  I liked it a lot.  The acting is also first rate...by a professional cast of actors.
B003L5BRXK|3.0|Good, but not the greatest Stones album.  It's been overhyped by everyone.  Good documentary has been made about the making of this record.
B00A5IYC38|5.0|Quadrophenia is a great glimpse into the early 60's mods / rocker conflict in England.  It also is a great story of a young man's angst while growing up and finding his way in life as he deal with his identity, work, drugs, friends, and love.<br /><br />While the movie features music from the Who's album Quadrophenia, it iis only used to set the mood and help the story along.  It is not a rock movie, it is a period drama. The movie features a lot of great music from the period, early 60's, while Quadrophenia was released much later (1978?).<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone, not just Who fans. It stands on its own merit.
B009G9Z08S|5.0|Is not Kevin Conroy but the original RoboCop Peter Weller does a great job, his voice fits the grittier environment.  I never got around to reading the original Frank Miller books but this might make me go grab the Graphic Novels.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Would def put on my kindle!  Very satisfied with app.  very accurate.  easy to go through.  love having all my dif locations and easy to tab through
0316069434|1.0|After following Michael Connelly since book one, I have to say this was a major disappointment. Who can forget Harry sitting on his deck after the earthquake? Who can forget the death of Eleanor Wish? This book evoked none of the emotional connection Connelly creates with his characters. The Black Box was just a story, somewhat interesting, but the main character could have been anyone, but certainly not Harry.  The bar is high for Connelly's books, particularly the Harry Bosch series, and this one was just not worthy.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|needs some improvement !  some of the pictures while i scroll through are cut off until i open them.  wish it was as good as on my phone
B0059XTUVI|4.0|One cannot watch a Meryl Streep movie without wondering how she is able to portray so many different people so well.  She definitely is a &#34;one-of-a-kind&#34; actress!  I have so many of her movies and love her acting.  The movie story is okay, but the acting makes up for it.  Great movie for Streep lovers!
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Seriously~ do I need to say anything?  This is a must have for teenage girls who love there One Direction!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|app does not work!!! removed and re-installed and still nothing! it has weather for Los Angeles wich can't be changed, and doesn't even work for L.A.
B00709GTGS|4.0|Not much to say. Both Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are attractive actors and make for a pleasant romantic movie. It's not very deep. My stars are for good fluff.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As a small business owner, my brain never shuts off.  Calculator Plus is exactly what I need to do those quick calculations, as I lie in bed using my Kindle (mostly for Solitaire), trying to wind down after another long day.  Big keys, high visibility.  It's perfect.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Interesting and challenging, definitely a awesome take on crosswords. Also, I wish the music played throughout gameplay. I can dig it!
B005LAII9O|1.0|Oliver Stone is a relic.  One could not imagine such a poor script in an Oliver Stone film during his prime.  Indeed, 10 minutes of VO in the beginning of the film means both Stone and the script writers were too lazy to care about crafting their story. So why should we care enough to spend time to watch it?
1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall's information is some of the BEST for disease prevention. This is vital info for healing the PLANET! Eat wise and hearty everyone. Yummers!!!
0439882826|4.0|This is another one of the marvelously made pop-up books that adults would treasure. The figures are intricately made and my kids' eyes lit up when the sabers glowed. Very nice!
1401322425|5.0|my sister loves this book and was really pleased to recive it , it was so easy and fast to send it to her with this service
B00005MP58|5.0|The best interpretation of the classic story. There have been other Mr. Darcys but no-one is as vain and vulnerable as Colin Firth in this one. The best one yet!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The volume fade-in feature us a nice touch, but I really like the ability to gage my alarm clock kick on Pandora or Pay Music as well. A bit more challenging math problems would be niceas I can do the hard ones without waking up, to my chagrin.
B00008973Q|5.0|Shakespeare's tragic King Lear is depicted in a dark and sparse movie that captures his pain and confusion beautifully. Kurosawa is a genius. This is one I can watch over and over.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This movie is better than the dark knight rises in many ways, I,m not saying DKR is not a great movie, it is, even if it wasn't a batman movie, but I feel more batman ....way more, the dark knight returns.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Product is fine, but I never used it. I have to use corporate server on my phone which doesn't sync with anything.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Specially Gina, but yes ....it could have been a better movie probably more interaction  between main characters, and a different final perhaps mor graphic on Banderas  and the other loose ends.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|The book arrived only a few days after and in perfect conditions.<br />Nice reading. Laughers guaranteed!<br />Ozzy rocks out!<br /><br />I recommend it!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Let's face it,comic book characters don't tend to be considered as art(which is pretty ironic-nay,moronic-isn't it?),but Chris Nolan's take on the Bat has done much to change this.With his Dark Knight Rises,once again he gives weight,and credibilty to a fantasy world.His is a Gotham grounded in reality.It is not a question of what if...but it just might.He is clearly an intelligent film maker,and there is reasoning and logic behind everything that he does.It would have been easy, to produce a second helping of The Dark Knight,but quite rightly, Nolan pushes his story and characters forward.There is an understanding of what makes them tick-and progression.It is almost shocking,when we eventually catch up with Bruce Wayne...to discover his plight, and where he is.But the clues are there.Oh,yes-the clues are there.Once you know how this third film ends,what Nolan has been showing us does have a pay off.And that really,is the whole point of this film.Parts one and two have been leading to this.Even if Nolan at first didn't even realise it himself...his version was three dimensional.Batman,the most human of superheroes.Our figures of the printed page,have always had the most grand of beginnings-now with this third movie,we finally have closure.Do I recommend it? Of course...But how highly it should be thought of,probably comes down to the individual.How satisfying,you find the outcome.Rest assured though,there is a truth about it.Without a doubt, the greater reality is,is that the BAT will surely return.Just not in the form of the excellent Mr Bale.Or any time soon.Who then should follow in his nimble footsteps?Be the new king of comic-book films? Everybody knows Batman,and everybody would like to know.The support will be there.Well, the answer kids,is that he's here already.Yup-you heard.The problem is, that not everybody knows about HIM,and he d o e s need your support.Like your graphic novels gritty,dark,and adult?Want your comic movie heroes cool and funky,just likeBATS? Well my friend,the answers simple.And you can get your fix almost right away.Grip-a-thon!!! The name is \\" DREDD \\"...and if you missed him in the cinema he's comin' your way on blu-ray veeerry soon.Yep, Judge DREDD.British comic book classic set in a future america - and he's the biz.Karl Urban is a name who should be on everybody's lips.And if you do not yet quite know why,then check him out come mid-january.As someone reading this page,I feel sure that you will be glad that you did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love love this story! Author did a wonderful job! Hooked and eager to read part two! As for now, I'll be headed to watch the movie…
0307592731|1.0|This book is well written, but if you want to read a description of adventure through the High Sierra, like I did, don't waste your money on this book. It isn't revealed in the description or in the excerpted sections available to read for free, but she bails out on the Pacific Crest Trail before she even gets to the John Muir Trail section and rejoins the trail 500 miles to the north, skipping what to me is the most interesting part of the PCT.<br /><br />I felt ripped off. This information should be in the book description, especially the Kindle edition because you can't sell the Kindle edition or return it. (I discovered that you can return a Kindle edition within 7 days of purchase for a full refund, and I did so.)<br /><br />She is a good writer, but I am not that interested in a tale of self discovery. I wanted to read the experiences along the High Sierra part of the trail because I live at the foot of the Sierra in Independence and guide this part of the trail and I was looking forward to reading her experiences as a solo woman making her way through this most challenging part of the trail.<br /><br />I will probably finish the book, but I will be skimming through a lot of the self discovery part.<br /><br />I really want my money back because I have a limited budget and there is a new book on the early history of climbing in the Sierra that is really good and I had to decide between buying that book and this one that turned out to be a disappointment.<br /><br />I did a Google image search on Cheryl Strayed. She is alright looking, but she either was planning on low standards or overly optimistic when she brought an entire dozen pack of Trojans along.
B008AWBQGW|2.0|I gave this a low rating because as a Skynyrd fan from &#34;way back&#34; I was very disappointed in the music in this CD.  Looks like they may have lost the magic. I can honestly say there is not one song on the entire CD that really interests me...Sad!
B005KR6OBM|3.0|Tried atleast a couple of DVD players and was not able to play the disc due to the format not being recognized by the machines.  Loved the whole collection but just very disappointed with that one particular disc.  Just wished I could get the disc replaced.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|It may have taken years for Steven and the crew to get back in the studio...but ....oh...my....gosh....the wait was worth it.  I love every song on the CD and it is obvious that there will be several #1's.  I recommend it to die hard fans as welll as those who don't know much about Aerosmith.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. You can listen to a wide variety of radio stations from around the world. You can also listen to podcasts of your favorite shows like &#34;Car Talk&#34; or others.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Kurt Cobain as lead singer of Nirvana was in the prime of his life when he died.  The collection of music on this CD is haunting and suggests some of the pain he may be experiencing emotionally.  One of the greats who died to soon.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great....that's about it..;o)  This is my grandchildren's favorite Christmas CD.  It is definitely a staple in their household.  Thanks a lot.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Awesome book!  I loved the other 4-Hour books and this one definitely did not disappoint.  Can't wait to see what he comes out with next.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|i have seen this movie before and I LOOOOOVE IT. It honestly reminds me of myself I am a young woman in her early 30's and I have had problems with my memory (you don't have to get old for it to happen) and for this man to be their anyway no matter hat shows his true love for her, not everyone is willing to stick around especially when it could be considered a conveince for some to be easily forgotten. I love that I got my shipment so quickly and in good conditon just as expected.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|this is great on my kindlefire. not on my lg phone so much since there last update. but dice w/ buddies is my favorite of all time game, so far... please<br /><br />bring more with buddies games.
B000069AUI|3.0|I love coldplay's newest cd. It probably needs more recognition.  But this cd was not nearly as good.  I just recommend buying the newer one.

B004L35GAQ|4.0|I like almost all of the songs on this cd!<br />very unique band I think. They need more recognition. :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this book was very entertaining, but seemed to be pulling through the first half, and then rushing through the second. i love the series and many things were tied away and resolved, but maybe not as eloquently as they could have been.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|LOVE mumford and sons! I like their newest album Babel, which sounds similar, but I usually end up going back to this album. I like it more for some reason. They are both great though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book will go down into cult classic history just like harry potter. both are written in simplistic anguage but capture such a great story. definitely off to a great start!
B007G937CQ|5.0|I may be one of the biggest Saxon fans around, I love this band and have all of their releases. There is without a doubt that Saxon even in their old age can do a live show just as good as anyone can or ever have and Wacken is one of their favorite venues. This band is tight.<br /><br />  Heavy metal thunder showcases one of their live events at Wacken and features many of their great songs on this disc. The sound is great for a outdoor recording and Saxon tears it up! The only down side is Bifs use of the f word a little too much, you shouldnt have to hear that but thats Bif in his live show excitment. This is a great live cd I dont care how many other live ones you have. If you love Saxon you will love this live cd.  SAXON FOREVER !
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I had an older version of the App store and it worked great, definately a 5 star app. But after the most recent update, I can't access the store unless I delete the app and reinstall it. I tried reverting to the old app store, but it now forces you to update. Fix the app store back to the way it was and I'll gladly change this review back to 5 stars.
0307346617|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it didn't really do much for me.  Some of the stories were childish, and the better ones weren't nearly developed enough.  It would have been a lot better if there were fewer, more developed interviews.  By the end it all feels very redundant.  It's a light read though if you are looking for a quick distraction, just don't expect to be too enthralled by anything in here.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I have been a fan of hers since Genie in a Bottle. This album did not disappoint.. My favorite song on the album is Just a Fool with Blake Shelton.<br />A must buy for the Christina fan
B00A77II0U|4.0|I really enjoyed the game, it was a good balance between hidden object and discovery. I have never been a fan of clowns so this game actually creeped me out but I enjoyed it so much I couldn't put it down. My only problem is it can be a little slow when switching scenes and it occationally restarted it self. Still a great game!
141659521X|5.0|As always Vince Flynn delivers an action packed novel. Once you start the first paragraph you might as well expect to put all chores and any activities aside because you won't be able to put the book down. If you are looking for action adventure, look no further than Vince Flynn. Enjoy!
1606995359|5.0|Delighted to receive a copy of this, it is beautifully printed and bound and looks like it is made to last. The cover is gorgeous and of course the stories, being from the Duck Artist/writer Carl Barks, enthrall and delight. It takes me back to my childhood, when I used to read his Duck stories over and over, and I still do..the best comics are right here, and such a bargain price. Even if you never buy comics, this series is worth considering. Real adventure stories, and great humour, never tacky like modern comics can be. I hope they don't take too long to release them all. So far no news on the next release, although the Donald Duck title is moving along with issue 3 coming out soon..perhaps they are waiting for more sales of this volume before releasing the next one.? Great art and writing deserves to be seen and read!
B007SGM084|4.0|Good if you're into racy romances. Not want I expected from the comments I heard before buying. Would I purchase again. No. But I would borrow from libary.
1451620829|5.0|This book is the best!! Peter Criss' solo album may had not been the best of the 4, but this book is the best. I know i shouldn't being saying this yet. We're still waiting on Paul Stanely's book to come out soon. But this book tops Ace's and Gene's, in my opinion. For those who aren't really a Peter Criss fan but a KISS fan, I really recommand reading his side of the story being in KISS.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Would buy again.  This processor is a good value if you like power but do not like to bleed money from being too far out on the cutting edge.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Definitely a bright addition to my holiday music.  If you like Rod, you'll love this Christmas CD.  I'm listening to it again now!
0735327793|5.0|Granddaughter loves to put puzzles together.  We are hoping that she will like this puzzle as she is getting it for Christmas.
1451695195|2.0|Too much time spent on the coma and the sisters.  Wanted to hear more about the after death experience.  I know more about e.coli than I needed to know.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Sad evening. Many families with young children were there to see the movie. Deceptive poster implies that this could be a children's movie. It is trash that only gets worse as it unfolds. The Teddy Bear acts out the most vulgar behavior.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|what a classic movie, love love it!! such great actors: whitney houston (an music icon) and kevin coster together...um ya! could watch this over and over and never get old.....
B005J2UM9S|1.0|I kept bracing myself for scary surprise moments and was \\"gravely\\" disappointed.  Barely any suspense, poor acting, bad special effects if any, and stupid ending.  Glad I only spent $.99.
B00846REIS|5.0|So I read this book because of course I read all of the 50 shades of grey. This was a triology that I found recommended after reading 50 shades of grey, and it truely is fantastic. I love the book! I am ordering the next two. I have never been much of a reader but I think I finally found my place in reading :) Would recommend it to anyone who read 50 shades of grey!
B005KELW26|5.0|Was gift for my mom! She loved it, it met all expectations. It has become a permanent fixture in her purse!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book, hard to put down.<br />It was nonstop action from start to finish. I can't wait for the book.
B0099114WO|1.0|In tracking this AM, I notice my order being sent to Charlotte, NC.  Why?  Are you going to send me another shipment?
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Camera doesn't give results like ads show, can't find good info on using it.not sure it will get used now at all
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I loved this from the moment it was received. Very good price and very practical for me to use. Recommend it to anyone.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie really is nothing but the usual pretty facade and boring/bland pseudo-horror. Everything was rather predictable, and the end anti-climatic.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this - a slightly less aggressive Jack Reacher and a steady build up of characters and plot with a great finish. I read on Kindle, but bought a hard copy which is now &#34;doing the rounds&#34; of the family and they are all enjoying the read.
1457514508|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club was a great and satisfying read. The description was excellent. Particularly noteworthy was the characterization with thorough exploration of the characters' motives and description of their sometimes eccentric personalities. Heidi, Cindy and Carla were interesting and well cast. The reader is hooked immediately by the unusual setting and the great plot. Romance and intrigue always make for a good story. The description of the setting made the reader feel he was right there with the women walking his own dog in the park. I highly recommend this unique book and didn't hesitate to give it 5 stars.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I just finished this book and as usual the story and the on going charactors, of which you get to know personally through this series, holds your interest and attention to the end.  My wife is a fan of Vince Flynn and was who recommended his books to me some time ago.  Each book is enough different that you do not get board with the style or story lines.  I have stated  before that a great book is one that you think about through the day when you are not reading it.  This latest book lives up to that.  Again!  Myk
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Fine game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! N n.  nmmmnjv n bhgbbbbbjnnn. Hhhhhhhh<br />Bob ct.  Tunnel FCC  Johnny bank of bhgbbbbbjnnn. Hhbmllx.  Bbccu mnub
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love the The Big Bang Theory!! I love this set and that You can watch all episodes back to back without commercials. Great for a gift!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a great film with excellent music. Christine Agulara(?) has a fantastic voice and the songs she sings are great.<br /><br />Cher sings one great song and one that is just awful, which I fast-forward through.<br /><br />The daqncing choreography is unbelievably complex and very well performed.<br /><br />The story is interesting but you know how it will turn out for Angulara early in the film. It is interesting nevertheless. The soluiotn to Cher's club/money on the other hand is not predictable until it happens very near the end of the film.<br /><br />(I like the music so much that I also bought the soundtrack. Fabulous music.)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This has a lot of levels, so you don't have to worry about beating the game quickly.  Sometimes some of the levels do seem a bit repetitive, but it doesn't last long.  This is a great puzzle game, with the levels continuing to increase in challenge.
B00164GDD2|1.0|I think I received a defective DVD.  It will not play on any of my players, Blu ray or regular player.  Very disappointed and too expensive to return.  I wish sellers would check out DVD's before shipping them.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like playing Mahjong. Now I can play on my Kindle Fire anywhere, anytime. Try it you will like it!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Well, it was a slow burn for me, really.  The first 40 minutes had me turned around a bit, and the movie is VERY dark (don't watch during the daytime if you have windows in your viewing area!), but as it progressed I was completely engaged and loved it.  Happy Viewing!!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I love John Cusack and the special effects ar so awesome. I can't wait to watch it with my friends on 12/21/12!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As soon as you open this book it is impossible  to take pause. The highs an  lows that the characters experience only pull you in deeper. Be warned, if you don't have the time to read the entire book in one seating, you best not start it. Great book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Who doesn't like Adele in my age bracket. She is so soulful yet hip. This is a great cd for her fans.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I got this app all excited and was angry. it said that the update took up 700 mb. then I had to delete everything off my kindle
B004N62KTG|5.0|If you are a fan you wil enjoy this cd. I came to like Gaga late in life, and can't get enough.
B000007491|5.0|I HAVE ALMOST EVERY ALBUM OF SUPERTRAMP BUT I NEVER HAD THIS ONE AND I THINK IS THE BEST OF ALL SUPERTRAMP ALBUMS IM SO HAPPY I FOUND IT
B009SQRL4U|4.0|We liked it... thought it would be a cheezy movie, but it turned out we liked it.  I would even watch it again.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Loved the CD!  Can't wait to see her in concert!  ^_^  My favorite song is All too Well and Everything has changed.  I think this CD is a great new direction but it still sounds like her.  It just shows that she's really maturing.  Love you Taylor!
B005LAII80|3.0|I think this version was much more entertaining then the version with Stalone in it.  I will say that slow motion gore was a bit too much for me to stomach.<br /><br />I would recommend but not sure I'll buy it.  I saw at the dollar theater here, well worth a watch..
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is a must.  I realy like that you calibrate it to your Kindle and can recalibrate it as your battery gets older so it stays accurate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Colling takes us deeper into the evils of Planen. And then there is the twist you don't see coming until it is there.  Once again Like the Hunger games you are on the adventure that is life threating.  Just could not put the book down.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|As the title says...it doesn't work.  It crashes on the second screen at start up so I uninstalled it from my device.  Hopefully they will update it to work on the HD 8.9
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have an ipod and the update its awesome but I lost it so now I just wanna play it on my kindle but there iis no update. now I cant play with anyone b/c u can only play with the people who has the same update as you and everyone updated. Thanks
0761163808|5.0|Saw it when I was putting it on the shelf while working for Amazon.  REALLY cool!  Narrative is excellent and the pics move...way cool.
B004Y81JEK|5.0|The book arrived in very good shape.  Thank you!  I had lost our first Goodnight Moon book so this was the second one I ordered.
B0007TKH66|1.0|Okay, it may be a year since I ordered this but I bought it for a very good friend in NY for Christmas last year.  Amazon didn't have it in stock so I bought it from Carmel Beach Books through Amazon.  Now this is an entire season of episodes.  I didn't realize that you only get thirty days to return it if it's a faulty product.  About six weeks later (after Christmas) she discovered that many episodes would not play.  I bought one for myself and I had the same problem.  Now it was too late to return.  I e-mailed Carmel Beach Books about the problem and they told me to &#34;send it back.&#34;  That's all they wrote.  No return labels, no promise of money back - nothing!  Amazon wouldn't help me because it was over thirty days. I decided to cut my loses and I bought another from a local store and sent it to her.  I didn't bother to replace mine.  It's too bad because we both love the show and I had planned on buying more for the both of us.  I won't now!<br />  I must add, for the very lucrative Star Trek franchise, they sure put these DVDs in really horrible packaging.  It's very difficult to remove the disks from the container without bending them.  Pressing in the center doesn't help. Do you think it was planned that way?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A real page turner. I just could not stop reading this perfect yarn. I finished this book in just three days because I just couldn't stop reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is great for killing a little time running from monkeyskull demons.  Go ahead, take the idol and start running.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I absolutely love Harry Potter. All of the books and movies are great, but Half Blood Prince is at the top of the list for me.. Great movie!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This is a great season of a great series... or a great series of a great show (depending on what side of the pond you happen to be on... )  Christopher made an excellent return for the Doctor and his performance is often underrated in my opinion.  I could go on and on, but the basic idea is if you are looking at this, then you probably already have some sense of what Doctor Who is and, while he is no David Tennant or Tom Baker, in the history of Doctor Who, there had been no one who better portrayed the torment of the Timelord adrift alone, returning to humanity and having his own &#34;humanity&#34; returned to him.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|the game was fine but very wordy. I could do without all the strange characters.  lags in many areas.  I was torn between liking the game and being frustrated with the endless dialog.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|I did consider rating Easy A a bit lower, because it's certainly far from perfect.  But I had to take into consideration that it's just so *watchable*, and has been my go to movie for awhile now when I'm really bored, and after seeing it I think six times I still am not really tired of it.  Easy A is frequently paired with Mean Girls, in that both seem to be satires of social and sexual politics in high school, but I must say I loathe Mean Girls.  As far as I can tell Easy A is more intelligent, less pretentious, and less overall annoying than MG by a long shot.  While it does make some huge assumptions about the behavior of teens to drive its plot, and relies on stereotypes at times, it can raise some interesting questions about conformity or whatever.  Maybe the ideas Easy A addresses aren't new, but that isn't how satire works in the first place.<br /><br />I excuse a number of Easy A's issues-- stereotypes, assumptions, and the need for a fair amount of suspension of disbelief-- by assuming that it's intended as a farce.  Here's the definition of a farce from Wikipedia, not because I assume you don't know it but because it fits the movie so goshdarn perfect: a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience by means of unlikely, extravagant, and improbable situations, disguise and mistaken identity, verbal humor of varying degrees of sophistication, which may include word play, and a fast-paced plot whose speed usually increases.  So it doesn't matter that in real life, the *entire* school would never care about one girl's (boring at first) sexual exploits.  It's just a plot device to make a point about how society views men having sex in a more positive light than women doing it. As for the stereotypical Christian characters, yeah, I can see how the depiction would be offensive to some.  Should they have been more fleshed out?  Yeah, probably, but I'm not sure there was *time*.  Again, they served a narrative purpose.  Though packaged as a silly teen comedy, thiswas a movie with something to say.<br /><br />That all sounded iffy, so here's some stuff I definitely like: first of all, I was pretty happy with how they wrote the gay kid.  He had some depth.  He was sympathetic.  UNLIKE the supposedly gay boy in Mean Girls, he did *not* kiss a *girl*, and was actually shown to have a boyfriend at the end of the movie.  So that's cool.  I don't know what he's doing for money, since he ran away from home, but we'll assume he's got something worked out.  I also liked the way the film was structured as a webcast, and Emma Stone's performance-- of course.  There were some truly affecting moments with her character, like when she admitted in confession that everyone hated her, and she kind of hated herself as well; also when she and Brandon had a moment after their supposed tryst at the party.  He was really grateful and all, but I don't think it made up for how everybody stared at her when she left the room.  That brings me to Todd.  He was actually waaaaay more understanding than the main character deserved, and certainly a candidate for most tolerant (boy)friend ever.  Finally, I don't know if the climactic scene with the musical number is a thing that would happen in real life, but it was an homage to '80s movies in the first place and it was also really cool.<br /><br />So overall, I can understand some criticism of this movie, but I still like it a lot. It seems to be the sort of teen girl movie that a lot of guys can appreciate, and I'm not entirely sure why that is, but it's awesome.  Now if only people weren't willing to gut me for dumping on Mean Girls.  Talk about your stupid stereotypes, but that is neither here nor there.  Easy A gets a 3.5.  It would get a 4 if I didn't actually think that Christians had a point in feeling offended by it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book did a lot of jumping around. I had a hard time following it. The author made Kat this wishy washy girl who can't make up her mind between Gale and Pete. I figure the final book will be much better. You have to read this one to know what is going on in the series but it was not great.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|So far I have watched only the first 3 episodes, but I like them and will watch the rest of the season.  I don't really understand how and why Betty has become so fat!  They did a real good job making her appear heavy, since I'm sure she hasn't really gained all that weight.  I watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix and became hooked.  I worked as a secretary in the early 60's, so I can relate to the time period.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is an amazing book that I read in only two days. Jeff Kinney is a very good author and illustater. This book is very good and you should read it!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This kept my 3 year old very entertained. He loves it and can play most of the games on his own. There are a few where he needs help because he's not used to playing games, especially on a touch screen, but he enjoyed it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I'm new ti Kindle and Angry Bids.  The program just didn't open and I didn't know what to do.  It deserves negative stars just for that.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|But I'll stick with the Nature Sounds app. This does not offer as many choices and has the break between sounds where the audio loops which is not relaxing to me, more annoying really. It's nice that you can &#34;mix&#34; sounds together but that is probably the only plus. I also did not find the audio to be of good quality.
B002VECMAE|5.0|i would recommend this to everyone. it made me laugh my arse off. if you need a good laugh buy it , watch it and laugh!!!!.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This package includes the theatrical version of The Lion King, and I do believe it includes the extended version as well. I grew up with the theatrical version, and personally I can't stand the added scenes and songs in the extended version. The digital and audio quality are marvelous. I would most definitely say that this DVD has the best quality version available, and for a really great price.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love the vocal pipes on the lead singer. Moves me to get a move on. I would reccomend this cd to others.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|My CD came quickly in the mail!<br />Was wrapped and brand new.<br />Def. would recommend using them for quick service!
B003D12ESE|4.0|My middle schooler gave this movie high thumbs up. He thought it was very exciting. It's an oldie but goodie.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very entertaining. Typical Vince Flint.  It is always interesting to get a little more insight in his characters in each new book.
0446580848|4.0|This is one author I truly look forward to reading & I have read all of his novels.  I do admit that the names of the people in this book leave me cold as I cannot remember them, etc.  Almost wish authors would pick an easy name at the beginning with a reference so one can read these newer subject books & not be put off by trying to pronounce names.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This is a very interesting story, told in a unique fashion as the author composed it based on a number of old photographs he had come across.  My beware message is that this book contains numerous b&w photos that do NOT show up well on the kindle,  the OLDER Kindle, that is.  I have the new Paperwhite Kindle, and the photos show up perfectly fine when you turn up the brightness.  The photos generally are odd to creepy, and greatly enhance the story.  I saw one reviewer note that he was put off by the violence and cursing.  ????  Hmmm...  I can say that there is virtually NO over the top cursing aside from a few mild expletives, certainly none that I think would offend anyone.  Violence, also even milder than the cursing.<br /><br />Enjoyed the story.  Hope there is a sequel.
B009X00E18|3.0|I already have an ipad and I have used the ipad smart cover quite a bit.  This Malware Folio is clearly based on the Apple smart cover.  But it only has two instead of three panels.  So when you turn it into a stand you fold it and the edge sticks into a notch on the back.  It is not nearly as easy to fold and set up as the apple smart cover.  Once I figured out the notch on the back and how to feel for it was easier to use, but still the design is not as good.<br /><br />But I do like that it is snug, it is a very light weight cover and should protect it from light scuffing and minor drops.
1609611543|5.0|When I saw Dr. Davis on the Doctor Oz show, I had just about given-up on reaching my goal weight.  I just couldn't break through an unacceptable plateau.  I decided to buy the book on Kindle, read it and give wheat elimination a try.<br /><br />It's been a week and I've easily broken through the plateau.  I'm losing about 1 pound a day...just like clockwork.  I've known for years that the only way I can control my weight is low carb living but I was never that careful about wheat...because \\"everybody knows that whole grain wheat is good for you\\".  What a amazing hoax on the American public to have the government and most physicians recommending a food that is actually worse than high fructose corn syrup!!!<br /><br />Those farmers out there in the mid-west are killing us.  We've got to stop eating their awful products.
0345803507|2.0|See the review for book 1, please.  I actually would give it 1 1/2 stars.  I did like the descriptions.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a fantastically fun and OMG read!  Thoroughly enjoyable and I simply couldn't put it down.  I was still shaking my head days later.
B002JI94J4|1.0|I think I will love the movie if I see it, but the products is advertised as blu-ray and my original order was a DVD. I sent it back and had it reshipped and the second one came as a DVD again. I sent it back and have not reordered it. I know I should be rating the product itself, but I can't get the product as advertised.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I saw Glen Hansard recently in concert with Eddie Vedder. It was hard to say who I loved more. I am a new fan of Glen. What great talent and heart goes into his lyrics. This is a sweet little film and the music is simply wonderful. Loved it!
B0091THRCU|4.0|This product offers great protection, but can be difficult to remove quickly enough to answer a call. The release strap works well, and the product is well made. It'll probably loosen up bit with use, so these are only minor issues. A very nice product.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I've read both of Mark's books and have enjoyed them both.  Being a Microsoft Fellow, Mark knows technology and the tech in his accounts ring true.  This makes the story he tells feel real, and draw you in even further.  Steve Gibson mentioned you don't really need to have read his first book \\"Zero Day\\", I suggest you do.  This novel does make references to what happened in the first book and, having read it, I feel if I hadn't I would have missed something.<br /><br />This book is one of those rare finds, \\"a page turner\\".  Mark gets you invested into the story very quickly and you keep reading just to find out what is going to happen next.  As an IT professional, I know that the time and effort Mark takes to make his books factually accurate lead to a story that you quickly believe could happen at any time in our modern world.<br /><br />If you have interest in the changing world of technology around you, or are curious about what \\"could happen\\" if we all continue to ignore the signs, then this book will satisfy those desires.
0345803493|2.0|See the review for book 1, please.  I actually would give it 1 1/2 stars.  I did like the descriptions.
B005LLX582|1.0|I am a fan of indie movies and don't mind slower, character driven plots, but this movie was bad. If I had been at the movie theatre, I would have probably left the movie after the  first 20 minutes. Nothing happened and it was impossible to understand what was going on. Since I watched it at home, I did manage to finish it but I feel like I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my time! Do not recommend this film!
B00933JL0A|2.0|I played one level and ended up having to build every building in the game.  I suppose the other levels would be different maps but it still feels like what's the point if there is nothing else to do?
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it so much, I had to have the DVD so I could watch it again and share it with others.  I rarely attend movies, much less purchase the DVD, because of all the filth that Hollywood seems to think is necessary in order to sell tickets.  &#34;Courageous&#34; can be seen by the entire family without worrying about having to explain any &#34;adult&#34; situations.  Love, love, love this movie!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game,very challenging,Good graphics and story line. Easier to play on Kindle fire than a smart phone. I have most of the angry Bird games for a reason.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this a very neat app to Learn how to make a little bit of everything that may look hard to make but is really 3asy!!!
B0000TB014|5.0|Umm, not much to say it's Michael Jackson.  Cool to have all the number one hits on one disk.  Try it you will like it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|If 'Life of Pi' were longer, I would call it a 'spiritual epic'.  It's not quite epic in scope, but it is certainly an incredible adventure and spiritual journey.  Like the ocean which plays such an important role, this book has many levels of understanding- some clear and apparent, some less easy to discern, and some deep and mysterious and filled with surprises.  I especially like the two stories at the end because only the individual can truly tell what an experience or encounter with Got means to them.
B008S0TAY6|5.0|These are always excellent.  Reading it on the Kindle Fire is easy and enjoyable.  I started with paperbacks, I wish I had started on the Fire!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|This product was ordered for my girls computer.  It is easy to hook up, easy to use and ships withing a few days
B007HJ96NO|4.0|Director Giuseppe Tornatore made a truly beautiful 3-hour movie, but the Producer said it was too long and forced it to be cut down to 2 hours.  The resulting film won many awards around the world, including the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in America.  Many leading critics called it one of the 10 best movies ever made.  Tornatore hated it!<br /><br />Skip forward several years:  Tornatore is now acclaimed and wealthy.  He buys the rights to the film, puts back the deleted footage, and re-releases it as Cinema Paradiso - the Director's Cut, a much better movie even than this one.<br /><br />Buy the Director's Cut version! I would give that one at least 6 stars!
B002RSDW80|4.0|I love Julia Child. Watched her for years so of course I would love this movie. I was pleased to learn abit about her life in France. She entertained my mom and I on saturday mornings . I learned alot from her especially how to make french bread and crepes. I think many would like this movie. Although I cant remember if there was any colorful language in it. Julia Child lived in Massachusetts where I am from and her kitchen (since her death) is in the smithsonian. This is a fun movie especially for people who like to cook
0345803485|2.0|I don't understand all the hype.  Ladies create some fantasies of your own.  Felt like she wrote to much and turned it into three books.  What was with the telling the beginning in the last book, really???  While I did like the descriptions the scenes were redundant.  I know it is fiction, however, it was still a very long stretch - really? a virgin that innocent has a orgasm the first session - and so connected to it - ugh, not.....  I only finished reading because I committed when I spent my money on all three, plus I like to see things to the end so I have a true sense of it.  Now the books are just collecting dusk as my friends can't get past the first few chapters, if that.  It's not because of my opinion :-).
B0063IH60K|5.0|This wonderful game of Solitaire brings me many moments (hours?) of great joy!  I love the way the soft-ware system provides a &#34;time&#34;  and  up-date on  the current and previous &#34;scores&#34; (number of moves).  It's such a good way to relax!  I would indeed recommend this app to family and friends.
B008RR2VNC|5.0|This are always so much fun.  I love how all of these stories are mixed together.  A very quick read!
0307887448|5.0|Great book if you like the 80's, lots of references and things that happened back then.  I bought it for a 60 year old friend who loved it.

B000002L42|4.0|I'm a hardcore Dan fan and as much as I'm inclined to love everything Donald Fagen and Walter Becker has ever done, I cannot fully love this recording.  Although I was in the audience when \\"Reelin' In the Years\\" was recorded (Poplar Creek Theater, Highland Park, Illinois, August 1993) it doesn't improve my view for that very reason.  Set simply, Alive In America is NOT representative of the Steely Dan concert experience.  I've since seen Steely Dan (and Donald Fagen Band during his 2006 solo tour) live over 30 times.  No two shows have ever been identical.  The solos are always virtuosic, the arrangements are often wonderfully unpredictable, Donald's banter and Walter's stories throughout are often witty, hilarious, even endearing, and the flow of the setlists is seamless.  As much as I like AIA, it's way shorter than any one concert, there is no dialogue, and the flow is choppy when compared to the real deal.  It's a Franken-concert, taken from various concert appearances from their 1993 and 1994 tours instead of chronicling a single show. Furthermore, the editing and overdubbing of effects in the studio makes it feel even more inauthentic.  I wish, for posterity, that DF and WB would release at least ONE album (and/or DVD) depicting a concert in its entirety.  Alive In America should have been (and still could be) released in multiple volumes. SD is reportedly planning a tour for Summer 2013, so if you've wanted to see them Live, you will have a great time. No Live Album takes the place of being there, of course. But, since AIA is the only Live Album SD has ever released, it's worth buying.  The [[ASIN:B002D2NCCG Two Against Nature DVD Special]] is worth purchasing as well.  In the meantime, I will keep my fingers crossed for a future release that better depicts what Steely Dan in concert is really like.
0307592731|5.0|Very entertaining and captivating. I hated to see it end. One of those books that you really cannot put down.
0887307280|1.0|I first encountered this book at the hands of a CEO I once interviewed with. He was quite proud of forming a small business based on this philosophy. I read his personal copy after I had introduced him to the FIFTH DISCIPLINE developed at MIT. I was quite alarmed when he thought his employees should all wear uniforms and follow a strict dress/behavior code. His objective in the end was to franchise and then sell his business to retire wealthy. Emyth insists that a company does not need \\"expensive\\" trained employees; anyone can be taught from a book of procedures what their duties are. Therefore, all the owner needs do is hire \\"dummies\\" and keep the profits to himself. Today that CEO is still struggling to expand beyond the small group it was seven years ago (now 14 yrs old). They have won several small business awards, but they were all on account of the abilities of his hired help, not for the Emyth philosophy. It is fortunate indeed I was not hired there. An engineering service cannot operate on the same principles as a fast-food chain. He will never achieve his objectives because Emyth is about exploiting unskilled labor, and engineering requires highly skilled labor. No CEO has the savvy to generate a list of prescribed problem solutions to his staff, which is what engineers are taught to do. Corporate feudalism is what Emyth is about. Look at what has happened to Wendy's since Dave passed on. Did Dave need two years of market research and to spend several million to figure out how to beat BurgerKing (and they still haven't pulled that off)? Dave set the standard which competitors strove to emulate. Emyth isn't about setting the standard, it is about being a ME-TOO kind of owner.<br /><br />Like other one star reviewers, I second their opinions which do not need reiteration here. Spend your money on The Fifth Discipline and its companion workbook. THAT's a dynamic, thriving philosophy that doesn't require conformity, but builds on diversity. It was the Fifth Discipline principles that made the Saturn car such a hit, and its abandonment that brought it down.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can't help but thank Stephen Chbosky for this beatifully written story. Though I wasn't around during the time and setting of this book, Stephen portayed it accurately and fully, allowing the reader th truly understand the main character and become apart of the stort themselves. The characters were each thought ou wonderfully, and I couldn't imagine the story going on any further without them. They were essential, and Chbosky definitely knew this when he wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Sure makes finding files easier on my Samsung Infuse. I'm very pleaed with this product and will recommend to friends in the future. Ordering and electromic delivering were simple and easy. No complaints here!

B003TSEEDY|3.0|The author takes the reader through what goes on in the mind of an young boy and how he looks at the outside world.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read the Jack Reacher novels, but wish I could get my money back on this one.  The characters were not developed, the description of the highway, fields, building were laborious and very uninteresting.  I will think twice before I put out $13.99 for another book by this author.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This ebook was easy to order and delivery was flawless. The only thing that left me slightly unhappy is the fact that the product is not actually downloaded to my Devices but resides on a 'cloud' somewhere - making it impossible to print a hardcopy.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Too tedious of an app and I will definitely check reviews before  I get any app. Patience is a virtue.
B0097AX6EQ|4.0|at times there is quite a lot of technical detail regarding the Huey and how to fly it but even for a novice like myself it was still interesting.<br /><br />The story covers an aspect of the conflict that i had not read about before and it was well worth a read, being well paced, honest and human.<br /><br />The author comes across well as do the other servicemen who form the subject matter of the book.<br /><br />The impact of his service on his own personality was obviously very significant but the quality of his writing would suggest that he (eventually) recovered to lead a fulfilling life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good but I would like to see the games cost less to make it easier. I believe that is why I rated it a 4.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so excited this is finally available for my androids and I can have pinterest every where I go, I have never had an issue with this app, I loooove it!!
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Great little app  for that video you like to save to view at a later date when you remember that it was worth the redo.

B0013LPS7U|5.0|I've been a U2 fan since I first got MTV in 1982, and they quickly became my favorite band.  It's nice to finally have all the old singles and B sides that were only available on vinyl now on CD.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am one of the ones who watched the movie before reading the novel so I came in the game with knowledge. Of course the book is much more detailed and that's the way I like it!!
B0027BVMSY|4.0|I know this one didn't rate as high as Casino Royale but it was still a fine movie with a solid performance by Daniel Craig. I enjoyed it and it was a good set up for Skyfall which was terrific
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I just upgraded to the pro version.  Now I can listen to it play in the background and have more sounds to choose from.  Free is good but upgrade is better.  Support a great product!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|The opening sequence of this movie was beyond AMAZING and the movie had nowhere to go but UP. AND IT DOES. I was only aware of the Sean Connery movies and always felt they were too much on the fluff side (even though I like Sean Connery). I read all the Ian Fleming novels in my teens and REALLY LIKED them. VERY EXCITING. I believe DANIEL CRAIG is the actor to accept the BOND mantle. JAMES BOND is humanized in this movie, as well as portraying a tougher than nails character. This movie is SOOOO GOOD. I can not imagine anyone not liking it or finding any fault with it. IT has SPECTACULAR action scenes and the athleticism needed to perform many of these scenes is breathtaking. BRAVO DANIEL CRIAG and BRAVO EVERYONE who had any part in bringing this to screen. I did not expect to like this film any where near as much as I totally did. TWO THUMBS UP FROM ME ON TOP OF THE 5 STAIRS.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|YES IT REALLY HAPPENED! This book is outstanding. It's the best novel I've read this year (besides Hugh Howey's WOOL series). It gripped me from the first couple pages and didn't let go. I won't be surprised when this book keeps sneaking its way up the Amazon charts like it has been doing for the last week or so. I can't recommend this book enough, and for $.99 it's a steal. I'm not sure the author realized it was going to be this popular when he threw it up on Amazon, boy, he's going to be surprised when we see this thing in the top 200. It would make an excellent movie too. I just recommend it to my brother and he's already loving it. When I was at work, I was literally counting down the hours till I could run home and keep reading. I love the new age of self-publishing, you never know what you're going to find.<br />Buy this book now, you definitely won't regret it.
0316232955|2.0|Although the story had great promise, Colfer's writing ability is only decent at best.  He hasn't mastered the ability to show and not tell and he often falls back on familiar language.  Some of the plot feels very derivative and he doesn't bring a new perspective to the narrative.  The only saving grace is that there was no romantic relationship.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|Overall I thought this movie was well put together and entertaining.  Who wouldn't like a movie with this cast?<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the beginning is a bit stoggy, the concept of an aging Peter Pan is droll.
B006FE83UE|5.0|A true classic. A story filled with prejudice of their time and justice coming out of the courts with the help of an Attorney who believed in a person not judging by color!

B00AA0TJO8|3.0|looks like a fun game and great idea but......the buttons that you need to be able to click on are just out of reach, off the screen. I don't believe KF has an adjustable screen size so please fix!!

B009JCL58G|5.0|I read in the the 'most helpful critical review' that there was a distracting shuffling from people on the set. This made me upset, and I went back and tried to listen closely to see if I could understand what they were talking about. I think this person is referring to my personal favorite song on the soundtrack \\"Death is Only a Door\\". I believe that this shuffling is purposeful and is meant to give the sound a feel such that you forget you are listening to a soundtrack and the music just becomes a direct tract into your emotional drive, helping you to release a certain set of complex emotions and feel moved and have your mind opened.
1451695195|5.0|I saw an interview on ABC channel on TV and I was very interested, I started to read this book and it's very good.
B009E3EY38|2.0|I haven't yet purchased this item (only fools do that, before reading some reviews first) and I feel seriously in debt to Amazon for making reviews available for everyone to read before purchasing; This is going to be the best $35.00 I'll ever save. Just reading about the video editing on this blu-ray gives me an anticipatory headache. I have the new Doors live '68 blu-ray, which does NOT have video editing that jumps around every 3 seconds, and is a joy to watch. I like to relax while watching something, the last thing I want is to be disturbed and made to feel seasick while watching a video. Once again, thanks Amazon!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found E.L. James in all three books witty and entertaining even though the topic was a bit disturbing. My concern with all these books was that the young women today will look at sex from her angle which I felt was disturbing. I think the novels did not portray sex from a loving, caring viewpoint.<br /><br />Naturally, Anastasia's good fortune at snagging a multimillionaire who just adores her is an extension of our early Cinderella syndrome. Don't we all want to be adored by a Prince??

B004GJNFHG|4.0|Hunger follows Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender) and the 1981 Irish hunger strike where the Republican prisoners tried to reclaim their political status. A film with few words; a film with powerful imagery and actions. Hunger often requires the audience to think deeply about what is shown, and that's something I really liked. There is one particular scene that did have a great amount of dialogue; this specific scene is the meeting between Sands and Father Dom where they have an authentic, immersive thought-provoking conversation. The entire film is very interesting, down to the painful ending. Michael Fassbender is amazing in this film, and so is the rest of the cast. It does get hard to follow at times, especially if you're not familiar with the incident, since it doesn't take the time to fully explain. And, it does have a slow start and a couple of scenes that drag-on.<br /><br />Hunger is recommended for fans of dramas, especially visual dramas. This film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, as of 12/8/12, in case you're still not fully sold on it.<br /><br />Hunger has strong violence and blood, and constant full male nudity.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Worth the price if you have a hero 2 and want to shoot underwater.  This is great for fishing or family vacations.  I have used it many, many times and I am very happy with it.
0375869026|4.0|I'm a middle school English teacher who recently learned that some extra funds exist for another class set of novels.  I read \\"Wonder\\" because I'm looking for a book to add to those my sixth graders will study.  From the synopsis and other reviews, \\"Wonder\\" sounded like it could be particularly engaging for middle schoolers.<br /><br />The story was indeed great.  The author did a good job of relating events from several different characters' points of view, no easy feat.  She made each character's voice believable.  Initially, I was very excited about how easily the story sucked me in, and I could also imagine that the main dilemma presented in the novel - of whether or not a person with extreme facial deformities could find acceptance in middle school - would make for some excellent class discussions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, I could never invest our school's limited funds in this novel, as it contains far too many references to fleeting fads.  I get that the author was probably aiming to make the characters sound more like real kids, with talk of Ugg boots, Xbox games, iMacs, and different kids' cartoons (along with the charcters' use of transient catchphrases like, \\"I know, right?\\"), but the many mentions of brand names effectively ruined the novel's chances of becoming classic young adult fiction.  In another couple of years, this book is going to seem VERY out of date.  Looking down the road, I could just imagine the class time I'd have to waste, explaining what all these things were and why they were included in the book.<br /><br />Also, the author made a mistake in having the main characters be fifth graders.  I know the world of New York City private schools might be different, but across the rest of the U.S., middle school typically begins in sixth or even seventh grade.  In my experience, fifth graders do not face the kinds of social pressures August and his friends describe.  Ten-year-olds are typically nowhere near as developmentally advanced.My sixth graders are aware enough to pick up on this descrepancy.  Additionally, I was not a fan of the way the 15-year-old sister's relationship with her boyfriend was portrayed.  The way the characters (freshmen in high school) so casually kissed in front of the girl's family, like serious romantic relationships and assumed physical involvement are normal and desirable for younger high schoolers, did not feel right.<br /><br />In summary, the story itself, along with the use of multiple narrators and their correspondingly believable voices, made the book highly engaging and entertaining.  It's just too bad the author had to ruin things with so many mentions of fads and brand names.  Without those, the novel could have become a classic.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I was bored at first. Small town gossip, I did take not of Rowling's interesting vocabulary, but kind of felt it was forced. By the end I was involved and loved how she presented the story.
B009EEELX0|4.0|It's a cool concept, being able to teleport anywhere you desire at will.  It has some cool fight scenes, just don't expect any kind of deep story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a wonderful action packed game.I love this game so so much. I reccomend this game for ages ten and up.
1435122968|5.0|The H.P. Lovecraft Complete Fiction book is a wonderful collection of his works impressively bound in a handsome cover with silver page edging, a great addition to my library.

B000NMW6J8|2.0|This blah movie just drags on and on with no promise of a climax.  No suspense.  No surprise.  No originality.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|I never became a Matt Damon fan until I saw the Bourne Identity. I got the box set and was impressed with how wonderfully and seamlessly they had tied all 3 different stages of his life reawakening and starting to think for himself. Damon made me a believer in his talent, the intensity in his eyes, his actions and split second timing to keep himself alive against all the power his handlers were throwing against him was amazing and of course the writers, directors and camera men were obviously working in harmony on all three movies and they all Jelled together perfectly<br /><br />Now the Legacy if we are to believe it, the timeline for this story is paralleling  the time that Jason was in New York still looking for answers and trying to come in out of the cold. The script is so convoluted I could barely follow the narrative. Cold Lakes, wolves, another agent killing time in a little shack totally bored with himself and stupid enough to go back into the shack even after hearing an uninvited visitor in the sky fast approaching. And then there is Edward Norton who talks about another Black Ops project called Outcome. He is afraid everything is unraveling and that all agents still out there beside Bourne need to be eliminated. And all the originals from the Bourne movies were there, the fat old white guys talking about things that I didn't understand because unlike the Bourne movies, this project Outcome was not fleshed out enough to comprehend what they were talking about at any one moment aside from the usual double-cross. These were they guys who were worrying about Bourne but if you hadn't seen the Original Bourne they really don't seem to be acting in this movie as though there was any connection.<br /><br />I have seen Jeremy Renner in other films and thought he was a good actor who need to find his niche in the movie Industry. There are few actors like Gary Oldman, who can change spots at a moments notice and thats why he gets so many varied and unusual roles anddoes them well, sometime even without makeup you never realize its him,so well does he become his character. Remmer is not on that level. Mission Impossible, Avengers. 28 weeks later. IMHO he has talent but not fore every role and this was one of them. He was a bore, he really seemed clueless as too what was goig on. \\"I fell off the Grid\\" yea? and? that means what to you and the consequences. Damon seems a natural when it comes to self defense with quick lightening moves to save his skin. Renner is more the pummel punch and run, not what you expect from someone in this program, but then again he did say his I.Q. was lower then the standard requisite but they let him in anyways. Were they hard up? Dont know, I guess we dont need to know why someone who didn't measure up mentally was allowed to join a super soldier program.<br /><br />And what was the geek gon postal about? Psychotic break was the cover story but again we are left to guess and why wast brain power on a totally useless scene.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz, I dont care how you slice it, is not an actress of any caliber. From the first time I saw her in the mummy movies I thought she was great as a ditz, then she was  playing opposite grand actors like Gene Hackman and Bruce Davison in Runaway Jury, she was the same. She is going to be forever playing mediocre characters like a nurse in  Bourne Legacy, she is wooden and very unappealing all around and does not do movies any favors when she is in them.<br /><br />Edward Norton sounded like a cross between his American History X character and Italian Job double-crosser. He is and can be even more of an excellent performer, witness \\"The illusionist\\" brilliant. Here I don't know what his job was because he wasn't part of the original canon. A cut scene with him telling Aaron Cross the job they do and innocent people gettig killed. A  morality speech shoved right in the middle. Was this supposed to reveal some pathos about Aaron Cross.? Were we supposed to feel some empathy for him.  He sat there all sad and sweaty as Norton lectured him about the realities of war and the job they do.<br /><br />This movie should not be considered Canon in my opinion. The chase scene was the lamest I have ever seen, with some number 2  on the list with low empathy who just as bad as Cross, one of their supposed better operatives they copycat the Moroccan chase scene which was well coordinated  and just made it into a stupid chase down Manilla streets, with motorcycle jumps that were so laughable it was sad.<br /><br />In my final summation I think they screwed up because they didnt really know what to do with Remmer. They focused a lot of chatter on coverups and in the end you have this aborted Legacy. They should have never done this move. They should have waited and cajoled Matt Damon to come back on his terms and make another fabulous Bourne movie. This film should not be the Legacy of what happened to Jason Bourne and all others like him.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Wow, is this a greedy app! It wants an unreasonable number of perms and then asks for either a Facebook or email login. I just don't trust this enough to review it more.
0307730697|5.0|This is a man of God who loves his country. Insightful and encouraging. This is a good read...not too heavy, but very well written.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is the best Clancy release (in a collaborative effort) since working with Larry Bond on The Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising. One of those 800+ page Clancy efforts that you actually did not want to end! Clancy fans that were hooked in starting with Rainbow Six will really dig this release!<br />After investing time over 3 days to read this book, I had no regrets spending $15 for the entertainment and education I received in return. This one was worth it!<br />Besides being a thrilling read, this Clancy effort really makes you think of the plausible dangers we face now and into the future! Trust me, this is not a waste!
0307951529|5.0|This book to me felt like the other half of 4-Hour Work week by Time Ferris. These two books are a POWERHOUSE!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is a drain, it stays on and running even when you go on to another app to work with. It runs my batt down while not using my tab. It is fun thou but I deleted it.
B002OSY2T6|1.0|This toy is the bane of my existence as a parent. My daughter has enjoyed playing with it from a few months old, and still does (she's 13 months now) but unlike any of her other toys, this one has a motion sensor that is very, very sensitive. So, say you've been playing with your kid and then you  move on to something else and put your child down for a nap. Then as you are sneaking through a room trying to be quiet, this idiot toy starts going \\"Woo!!\\" if you step even remotely near it. It nearly gave my husband a heart attack the first time it happened, in the middle of the night in our bedroom. This toy does have an off switch, so theoretically it could be prevented, but it goes quiet on its own through lack of play, so unless I'm being very vigilant, I tend to forget to flip the switch. The fact that my daughter enjoys it (esp in the early months) has kept me from smashing it with a mallet, but I think I've finally had enough. This toy is history.
B006O6EOII|5.0|This doll is absolutely phenomenal.  The makeup is perfect, and for a doll with glasses, they stay on very well during play.  As people with young girls know, these dolls have limbs that come out rather easily, but Mattel seems to have really listened to its customers.  My seven year old niece is pretty rough on her toys, but the limbs on this doll seem more durable than past Monster High dolls.  The details and quality on the clothes and body, as someone else mentioned, are far superior to the Dead Tired line - The vertebrae heel on the skate and the brain helmet is a nice touch.<br /><br />I love the hair, but much to my frustration, my niece damaged and brushed it out and messed it up...  It's geared more toward collectors than children in that regard, but my niece loves the doll, and I suppose an actual zombie WOULD look a little ragged.  For one of the less expensive dolls, no quality is being sacrificed, and as much as my niece loves it, I'd buy it again, absolutely.
0810983915|5.0|Even though this is a children's book. An adult can find the humor in it. I loved the way the pages were laid out like a diary and and the basic drawings within it.
B004811PMO|2.0|*** comments are on the online purchase, Oklahoma is a classic that really doesn't need a review because it is amazing**** bought this on instant video format and it was weird- I'm sure there are terms that cinemaphiles or videophlies use but basically something about the cinematagrophy of the streaming video was off- tempo of the video was off like it was too quick sometimes and I think maybe it was remastered to the point where the images were too crisp or it threw off the depth perception of the image. At any rate, sorry I can't describe it that wee but I paid for the 9.99 online ownership and I think for something like an amazing classic like Oklahoma I would invest in a physical copy of the blu-ray. I just wanted to watch it instantly late at night so I went for the online purchase
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am still reading this book, it is large and wonderful.  But I love the Witch/Vampire thing.  Very well written and will look forward to the second book when I finish.  Have no idea how it will end.

B009CGYO0K|4.0|I picked up \\"How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You\\" out of sheer curiosity... and I'm glad I did. I can't remember when I laughed so much just by reading a book, not to mention a graphic novel!<br /><br />The book presents a series of themes revolving around cats, one of which giving its title. The majority of them made me burst out laughing and I even shed a few tears. \\"Cat vs. Internet\\" particularly amused me as it reminded me of the times when I used to video chat with my boyfriend and his Siamese kept interfering. Actually, all chapters were very funny and I think all cat owners will relate to the situations displayed.  There are a few jokes here and there that were more like joke wanna-be's, but other than that, the book is hilarious.<br /><br />The art is simple, yet creative and effective, adding even more to the fun factor. The whole idea of cats being \\"evil\\" and planning to take over the world is a joke in itself, but, let's admit it, all of us thought of that at some point, even though just as a funny way of looking at things.<br /><br />I recommend it to all cat-lovers out there, who will definitely have a good laugh and will conclude the same thing all the readers of this novel did: our cats are trying to kill us.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Heartwarming story. Nice comparisons throughout the book on life and auto racing. If only we could see what our pets see.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I find myself disappointed with this one. Since when does Batman want to quit being Batman. I know Christian Bale was tired of doing Batman and so is Nolan and they reflected it with the story in the movie. Anne Hathaway as CATWOMAN was pure Brilliance.For me she saved the movie. She nailed Catwoman perfectly. Tom Hardy as Bane was another excellent choice. His back story was also better than the comic back story. They dropped the ball with Talia AL Ghul big time. I enjoyed Gordon Levitt's character alot. Heck he did more detective work than Batman. Overall I gave this one a two star rating because Nolan dropped the ball on Batman. I have hopes that the next one will be a True Batman movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn writes an awesome story!  His novels are top notch, and keep you turning page after page. Excitement, adventure, fast paced, and keeps you going.  I love all of Vince Flynn's novels.  Awesome!
B000P0J0D8|4.0|This one of my favorites. Includes brad pitt b4 he was famous, small role but played it perfectly. All star cast, each perfect for the part. Lots of cussing, blood and action but has mellow moments also. Today i consider this movie nostalgic in a very good way.

B00007KWHN|5.0|Released in January 1971, the third album from Yes is now seen as a timeless rock classic which marked a step change in style & imagination from the band's competent but unremarkable first two albums. `The Yes Album' also marked the replacement of founder-member guitarist Peter Banks (who fell out with Jon Anderson over the excessive use of orchestration on the `Time & a Word' album) with the truly brilliant Steve Howe, whose compositional input, technical skills and seminal playing in no small way contributes to this album being an outstanding piece of work, and who was to become one of the defining cornerstones of the unique `Yes sound'.<br /><br />Other reviews have offered excellent song-by-song commentaries of the album, so that won't be repeated here. However some general impressions stand out. First off, this band ROCKS; it's first & foremost a rock group, which plays with feel and passion. The keyboard mix pre-dates Rick Wakeman's joining by a few months so the moog makes only an occasional appearance, Tony Kaye supporting the melody principally with electric organ and piano. The overall sound is a guitar-rhythm section-vocal rock band spiced up with interesting compositional arrangements, great dynamics, vocal harmonies and some experimental pieces like `Perpetual Change'. The band finally seems to know what it's doing and where it's going, its distinctive sound beginning to emerge.<br /><br />You can hear Chris Squire on this album starting for the first time to use the bass guitar as a lead instrument, where rather than simply work with the drummer to underpin the rhythm, he offers a complimentary melodic structure to the guitar & keyboards, bringing an intelligence and complexity to the music rarely found among contemporaries.<br /><br />Above all, `The Yes Album' is bursting with energy. The opener `Yours is no disgrace' is one of the all-time great rockers with its distinctive tight opening bars moving into a driving riff, Kaye's organ work giving the impression of trying to constrain the energy of the rhythm section as Howe's choppy, wailing guitar offers bursts of sound as counterbalance to Anderson's equally energetic falsetto-register multi-tracked vocals.<br /><br />On the `expanded & re-mastered' release you get the original album, plus as bonus tracks single versions of `Your Move' & `Life Seeker' - the first part of `Starship Trooper' - & a studio version of `The Clap', Howe's solo acoustic guitar piece (a live-audience version was included on the original `Yes Album' to spotlight the band's new guitarist). Though the better-known live `Clap' is good, many listeners will agree the studio version has the edge.<br /><br />Overall `The Yes Album' though perhaps just a little bit rough at the edges and lacking the compositional complexity characteristic of subsequent `Yes' releases, showcases a tight, powerful & melodic rock band which has found its voice and distinctive style.  To quote Bill Martin: \\"The Yes Album inaugurates `The Main Sequence', a term from astronomy for when a star begins to shine at full strength for a long period of time. The star called Yes was already there in the sky but suddenly we noticed it, and we could not look away.\\"<br /><br />After 40 years `The Yes Album' still sounds great, and is recommended unreservedly.impression of trying to constrain the energy of the rhythm section as Howe's choppy, wailing guitar offers bursts of sound as counterbalance to Anderson's equally energetic falsetto-register multi-tracked vocals.<br /><br />On the `expanded & re-mastered' release you get the original album, plus as bonus tracks single versions of `Your Move' & `Life Seeker' - the first part of `Starship Trooper' - & a studio version of `The Clap', Howe's solo acoustic guitar piece (a live-audience version was included on the original `Yes Album' to spotlight the band's new guitarist).

0553801473|2.0|I'll just repeat what I just said on book 4.  If you didn't listen and read through that mess, perhaps you will listen now.  Mayhaps his initials aren't initials - you'll be saying GRR all day. No kicking of cats or wrestling with family members will resolve the empty pit you feel inside.  I loved the characters through the first three books. I mean, really loved.  The action, when it occurred, was fantastic in the first three books.  You won't get much of that in this one.  Remember what Tyrion did to the fleet?  Awesome.  Nothing here.  Remember what Danerys did for the slaves? You can keep reading, but it doesn't deliver.  I just today finished this one to my chagrin its just like four - meandering narration from minor POV characters, no resolution on any of them. Every time he added a new character a piece of me died inside.  I held out hope that this book would do it, that this truly epic cavalcade of characters would converge in fantastic conflict and resolution. Instead I'm left with an empty pit and lost hours and dollars.  I won't spoil it - but save yourself 1000 pages of time and just wait for the show. But you didn't listen to me on Book 4 so just know that I understand how you feel once you finish, with bulging eyes and a migraine, this messy dance.  I'm now convinced that GRRM can write characters well but has trouble with narrative. I'll watch the rest, maybe, via Netflix. SO BUMMED - GRRRRRRRRRRRR!<br /><br />P.S. If GRRM is reading this...I love you man, but if you write 6 and 7 I'll be reading the reviews before I entertain turning the first page.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book.  I don't know anyone that has not loved this book.  I went form one to the next.  I am waiting for the next book.  It was great fun to read.
B00466HM28|1.0|I thought I could go bargain hunting and get a usable piece of equipment, but save yourself the trouble. The drum pad worked sporadically and needs to be hit very hard. Programming each input signal to do what you want within your favored music interface is ... at the very least, non-obvious. Although I gave up quickly. The keys are very low quality (not weighted obviously) and smaller than a normal piano, meaning that you will have a hard time if you are used to playing piano, and you will have an impossible time learning on this thing if you are not used to playing piano. One key fell off almost immediately. Even if yours does show up working and doesn't fall apart during it's first use, you are still unlikely to get much value out of it, because it's simply uncomfortable to use and low quality.

0553582038|2.0|Mayhaps his initials aren't initials - just an expression of how you'll feel when (if) you make it through this and the next tome - GRR!  I loved the characters through the first three books.  I just today finished book 5 and to my chagrin its just like this one - meandering, minor characters, no resolution.  Every time he added a new character a piece of me died inside.  But I held out hope that book 5 would bring this epic cavalcade of characters together in a fantastic conflict and resolution. I won't spoil it - but save yourself 2000 pages of time and just put this one back on the shelf, and don't even look for the next.  I'm now convinced that GRRM can write characters well but has trouble with narrative.  I'll watch the rest, maybe, via Netflix.  SO BUMMED - GRR!
B005LLSLPE|2.0|I've been religiously watching this show. The first three seasons were great, but then we get into 4th season which is pathetic. Some aspects of this season are just silly, and I know that a lot of you might think otherwise. Sorry to say, but after finishing this season.......hoping someone kills (you know who), I'll put this show to rest.
B000002KBU|5.0|I've probably listened to this album at least 200 times and never get tired of it. It is a classic. Can't go wrong with this one.

B00785P2QC|3.0|just kind of slow going. but not too bad.  I like the options of more things to build. great expansion just costs a lot to expand.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say about the show?  one simple word:  AWESOME!!!  Great storytelling, and great acting from all the cast.
1400052181|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. I was able to visualize everything I read. I recommend this book to every woman as it tells us where the word pap-smear comes from and to any man interested in learning about Hela cells or medical history.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I watched season one of Boardwalk on Netflix DVDs, and that was so good, that I couldn't wait to see season two. I do not subscribe to HBO, so buying was the only other option. I got a good deal with Amazon.com Prime. I'll do the same with season three. (I share my DVD's with my sister).
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of the happiest movies I've ever watched. I'm just a 20s-something person, don't have a strong opinion about Will Ferrell like others my age do - it's just happy.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I sat down with my grandson to watch this because he seemed so intent on my seeing it. I couldn't believe how wonderful it is. The story itself is very sweet and the animation and artistry are compelling. I highly recommend this video. I've watched it again twice by myself and enjoyed it immensely both times.
B007TVANDM|5.0|My son picked this out because they use it in his classroom. It is a fun book! We are usually picking this book over most others we have downloaded.
B0064W652A|5.0|Batman: Hush was the one book that got me into the comic books in the first place.<br />Comic books bored me because you always new that the &#34;good guys&#34; would win.<br />With this story you see the main protagonist being tested physically and mentally and<br />at the end you don't know if he is truly victorious or not.<br />Plus, the art inside the book is gorgeous.<br /><br />A must have!
B008RTE08E|5.0|I had heard such terrible things about the Magical Mystery Tour movie, and never saw it in the theater.  However, knowing how much I love the Beatles, I decided when the new dvd came out, to give it a fair shot.  Am I glad I did.  Perhaps it is because I am 64 now, who knows, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the dvd and think any true Beatle fan would like it as well.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Okay but slow, definitely not like the old Grisham books.  Kind of disappointed but it was okay.. . . .
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher books and I love the flashbacks to when he was in the military. In my view, it gives the reader a better framework to understand his behavior outside the army. In this books, the reader finds out why he left, or better, had to leave. If you've read the other books, you'll start to see that he never moved on, he's still Jack Reacher the Major, an arrogant man that craves for the truth at all costs and has no respect for authority per se.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this on the big screen in 3D. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Yes you have to be willing to suspend your judgmental side but it is worth it. The animation is very creative and beautiful.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love this game very much!!!!!  it is so cool!!!!!!!!  how can u play a bad game install this game it is super cool
B0071MQBX0|5.0|What a wonderful production. I have seen the stage production of the &#34;Phantom&#34; twice. Watching the 25th anniversary DVD was unbelievable. I felt as if I was actually there in the audience. I got chills watching it.<br />And what a treat at the end when Andrew Lloyd Webber came on stage. I will watch this over and over.
B001BKG9SA|5.0|This concert dvd is like being right there, only better.  I gave it a five star rating, because there wasn't a 10 star to choose, this concert is that good.  Add headphones, sit back and you have the best seat in the house.  Incredible.
0307279189|5.0|This book is both informative and entertaining. Though there are parts with running advice and commentary on running research, it reads more like a novel telling the story of indigenous peoples that have run barefoot forever, and the trend of doing that in modern society.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|This film was produced in the mid 1940's following the best selling success of Ayn Rand's novel: The Fountainhead.  Rand insisted that every word she wrote in the script not be cut but used for the film.  Not one word was cut.  The film definitely gives us a look at Ayn Rand's philosophy of egoism and individualism.  Plus a number of philosophical truths uttered by the characters.<br /><br />I use this film with my Philosophy Class along with a study guide I have developed.  It works great giving the student a look at a Classic movie and Ayn Rand's philosophy of the Mind, individualistic creativity and selfishness or egoism (in the positive sense).  Plus it gives them a chance to draw out the philosophical truths in the film compared to their textbook.<br /><br />On the surface, the book is about a great hero who stands alone (willing to do so and willing to sacrifice at great personal cost) in his creative quest.  As well as a great love story exploring through the characters what true love is.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Big Deftones fan n love this cd great songs the whole way.the whole disc is seamless with great rhythms along with chino's controlled screams
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was ok. Too many adds. But it is a free game. Got really boring and didn't work always. This is a filler sentance.
B000OCZD5G|1.0|First I can't believe that I paid what I did for this poor tranfer to BD.  Last week $18.75 now this week $22.87,????? must be christmas, glad I only got ripped off for $18.75. This should have been in the $7.88 BD bin at wall mart. As a Bd disc this is as bad a transfer as you can get.The night scene where max alerts the bad guy buy dropping the cans and the boy distracts them is a prime example of the lack of effort to make this transfer worthy of such a classic movie. In the scene the picture is very grainy with a blue haze in the left of the picture the black of the desert night looks like it's snowing.For most of the rest of the film The color looks washed out as the blue skys of australia look whitish. Many parts of this blu ray are just as poor. The audio is terrable as well, there is a distinct lack of bass and surround effects and alot of the little things that make blu ray audio great are missing here. Accordingly the audio volume is low as well and I had to turn my amp up alot further than my normal level.  My dvd copy sounded better.( I compaird them last night) after watching my new copy and I had to cut the volume back on the dvd copy and had fuller richer 5.1.  To charge this price for it is outright theivery. Save your money until it goes into the bargin rack, your DVD copy is likley as good as this with more special features as this really has none. Very sad that someone deemed to put out this horriable print with minimal effort to call it blu ray. Buy a $5.00 dvd instead if you don't have one already.  Seriously it is that bad for the asking price or even from the blu ray bargin bin.
B006LR0XLM|1.0|As a citizen of a small non rich country I'm unable to bought this or any other Amazon Apliucation, only citizen from  the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan are able to have this aplications. This created a discriminating digital divide and deepen even more the inequality among rich and poor countries. It's a shame.
B007RTAR64|5.0|just received this doll from ysterday... and i have 2 say that it was... FANTASTIC... the desighner team of this doll must been very good... anyway, i love it
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Spoken in the words of Shakespeare by the actors and set in a modern setting.  Guns are called swords and rapiers.  Claire Danes makes a wonderful Juliet. Leonardo DiCaprio is a wonderful Romeo.  This movie is Epic!
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. Liked it better then Fifty Shades of Gray. Can't wait for the next book.
B004EPZ070|4.0|I am a fan of Emily Giffin.  I have read all her books to date.  I was really excited when I saw that this movie was coming out.  It stays really true to the text of the book and I think if you are interested enough to read the book you might as well see the film.  For the small price you can own this cute movie and have a girl's night.  Nice cast, acting is decent.  Not a cinematic feat to be reckoned with but come on if you're looking for a timeless classic-obviously this isn't it.  It is just a fun chick flick.  Plain and simple.
1469984202|2.0|I love sci fy books and got this one while online and saw it got great reviews.  First off it's long, consisting of I think 5 sub-books.  It started off promising but by the second part became repetative and predictable.  It's labeled as sci fy but it really has none of that.  It is post-apocalyptic, and that is about as sci fy as it gets.  There isn't much character developement and I never cared for any of them.  Towards the end I found myself willing my way to get through it(sure sign of a bad book).  I considered stopping and reading something else many times.  But i did finish because of the time I had already put in.  The author goes into way too much detail on mundane scenes(filler) and not enough on plot points that should have been explored(origin). All this really makes the book uninteresting in the end.<br />But that is just my opinion, and I am trying to save people wasted time.  So find out for yourself if you must.<br /><br />Recommend: for a good sci fy read- Old Mans War-  great book, and I plan on reading the rest in the series.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I bought acorns and never got them! Now I am trying to get my money back or get the acorns and it is taking forever with no response! I would have a better review if this was not happening
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The first book was better for me.  The history trilogy continued with book two but in the second book that followed the life of the same families in the U.S., England, Germany and Russa, the story line became more difficult to follow as children and grandchildren were added to the story line.  There were too many names to remember where you were in the story sometimes as the story unfolded into a new chapter.  But thoughout both books Follett revealed in clear format the evil that humans can inflict upon other humans and what happens when we the public allow politicians to do that which is evil and fail to control them.  It always starts out suttle and innocent while hiding an evil truth.<br />Liked them both but first one was easier to follow.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a much better book than his last release. It builds tension throughout with many plot twists. It was a true &#34;can't put it down&#34; novel.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|App isgreat to save space on your phone and to back up pics, but if like me you have more than just pics on your cloud then this app is not as useful as it could be. I would love to be able to also store documents on cloud and access them. Also MP3's instead of having a seperate app for pics and music for the same 5gb storage. makes little sense. What this ap does it does well, but it could be better if it was combined with Amazon MP3 and Amazon Kindle. An all in one app for reading, music and pictures. Hopefully someone will read this and Make it so. I gave 4 stars cuz the app is great but I wish it could do more.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The main character was much like the Jack Reacher character in the Lee Child books. If you enjoy the Lee Child books, you'll enjoy this book. The author did an excellent job of laying out the plot and answering all questions at the end. The story flowed smoothly and you don't have to fight to get through the book. This is my first David Baldacci novel and ill definitely read his others.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|its asome u don't even have to upgrade at all<br />u can get new cars and run over zombiess and kill them
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham books and was glad to see his newest book on Kindle.  It makes it so easy to take the book with me where ever I may be going just in case I have a chance to read.  I have only started the book but so far am enjoying it as usual with his books.  Keep up the good work with great Authors.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I consider the book well written, especially considering the subject.  Interestingly, it is written by an academic physician.  This particular group of authors is used to writing scientific articles, not about the afterlife or near death experiences, which is what makes the content of the book so credible, since many scientists are thought of as agnostics.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|This movie is awesome. Robert Downey JR is awesome. Don CHeadle Blu Ray BUYT IT NOW Gwyneth Paltrow Jeff Bridges Jon Favraeu Stan Lee
B009O2XY12|2.0|Besides what everyone else says (Fun game, constantly asks for money) This simple bubble shooter game also REQUIRES an internet connetion. In the middle of playing the game stopped because it said that it NEEDS internet connection and when I exited the app my home WIFI and 4g indictors showed a strong connetion. So you have to pay for play and it uses your data for God knows why. Good thing I'm still on an unlimited plan.
B000FZETIO|5.0|A TRUE CLASSIC FOR THE AGES.. THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT I FELL DEEPLY IN LOVE WIT IT... PRETTY IN PINK IS A MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION....
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I thought it would be difficult to make a months-long hiking trip sound interesting but she did
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is simple and easy to use. It was just what I wanted. To make things even better its free.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Their voices are super unique and much different than other xmas song covers. If you love her then you'll love this.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I like the monsters I can't get the app but it's cool and nice if the app has four stars I can play it that app I love it you care for monsters tons of them cool and my little pony and littlest pet shop are cool but in the littlest pet shop app the pets move slow they are the apps that are new all the girls may see littlest pet shop and my little pony the apps and the shows the girls have signs they said we love littlest pet shop and my little pony now good bye.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic is certainly one of the most prominent movies of the past twenty years, and this high-definition set really makes it pop. The movie itself has a great deal of depth and mixes the historical accuracy well with the fictional storyline; as long as you are aware that this is NOT completely historically accurate, this will be the most exciting ways to experience the events of that tragic night. As far as the blu ray is concerned, it is certainly the appropriate medium to display a product that had the impact that this one did, definitely worth the extra couple bucks.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I play this game all the time.  It's a challenge and  a great way to waste time. LOL I just like it .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app & easy to use.  The fact that it keeps a running tally of past calculations is a wonderful feature of the app too. App turns your Kindle screen into an easy to read calculator actual size vs tiny numbers to read. Recommended if you want a simple calculator app to refer to at any time while shopping, etc.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I did not have high hopes for a third movie in the series, but I think that this was far and away the best!  Younger viewers will enjoy the action and aliens, but the allusions to 1960's culture are the best part of the movie.
B002MGIIZE|5.0|We've always appreciated the original theatrical release of this film, but the Director's Cut brings to the screen clarification of Roberta Sparrow's tenets regarding movement through space and time, which further explains much of what the titular protagonist experiences.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written with a great story line.  I agree with a previous commenter that this series could be destined to become a science fiction classic.  Keep writing Mr. Howey and we'll keep reading!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I got some nice tunes using this.  I don't really use it a lot, but it still works for me.
B009ESIGHI|5.0|I am so excited that this film has been re-released again. Back in the day, while I loved it, I wasn't concerned about owning it. Now that I have two kids, I'm so excited to show it to them. I read through many of the reviews and apparently I'm the only one who's also excited that \\"The Love is Gone\\" song is well, gone. Or at least I've only read reviews of people who are upset the song is out. I didn't see this in the theater so I didn't know that the scene was an add-on for the home release and the TV version. I have always fast-forwarded through that scene. Personally, I think it slows the movie down and I actually don't really like the song at all. Just not my taste. So imagine my glee that the song doesn't belong, or at least doesn't belong in the theatrical version, and is (for my convenience not) there. Can't wait to see it this way.<br /><br />I do empathize with the legions who grew up loving the song and think that it's ever so wrong that it's not included in the widescreen version. I get it. Disney makes odd choices when it comes to our collective nostalgia. In this one case, their choice is working for me. It usually doesn't so I totally understand the frustration.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I watch this movie every Christmas and it is still hilarious!! I would recommend to all ages!!! Who doesn't like Will Ferrell!!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love this movie. I carried it in my purse on a trip over Thanksgiving and showed it to everybody who would watch it. I've seen it 7 times and I'm still not tired of it! I am 72 years old. This movie addresses so many dilemmas that our age group addresses in such a funny, loving and kind way. The acting is superb.I have recommended to everyone I meet!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Haven't read a bad one yet.  Don't get me started on that runt Tom Cruise playing Jack on film.  An abomination to any true Reacher fan.  This book has the usual plot twists, violence and street justice found in all Jack Reacher novels.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I like it. lost of different music to find and listen to.  Big record button that is of no use to me, but hey it's there.
B0039TAHMA|1.0|When are the HILDEBRANDT BROTHERS going to get the proper acknowledgement by the makers of this film concerning their influence on the TOTAL look of this and the other films by Peter Jackson ?!!!??
B004KZDV8E|4.0|It is good but not enough for me. I think I will buy the i5 version.I could not get my expectation from it.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of, if not the best movies of it's kind. Impeccably cast, artfully directed, and grittingly realistic! I highly recommend!
B007BZM30M|1.0|im soooo tired of hearing this song im so glad they have slowed down on playing it make a new song already!!
B00138J1XK|3.0|Not all the great Kansas songs I really like, but it's ok.  It only costs me 5 bucks so still a good buy.
0812993292|5.0|One needs a quiet little story  and this book does it all...I found myself rooting for Harold, loved his neighbor back home and rejoiced with his wife. I will admit that I need to purchase a photo book identifying wildflowers...
B009LRE040|1.0|This movie was so so horrible.  I had such great hopes for it, since the last movie was AWESOME.  But, no such luck.  It is discombobulated, with a confusing story line.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Not family friendly though, if you like familiy guy you will love this. Love love love love love love this.
B00899DR40|4.0|my 10 year old daughter and my two yr old niece love it and dance to it and sing it all the time
1451695195|4.0|Easy read yet written from a scientific perspective. Thoughful research went into the book as well as the emotional component. Gave comfort after losing a loved one.
B009SCRERI|5.0|My 6 year old loves Tink and this is her new favorite movie. I like it because she frightens easily and it is nice to have a movie without scary parts.
141659521X|5.0|My wife and I are longtime Flynn fans and chose the book because we enjoy his writing style and his views on how to deal with the bad guys. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an exciting tale.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book worth reading!!! Never got bored. Wished the book was longer......<br />All 3 books are worth it! Very pleased
B006LSZECO|4.0|read it for book club.  would make a good summer read.  fun story, interesting characters, suspenseful .  not literary enough for a book club read.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I heard one song from this and imediately bought the cd. I have all but two of Joe Bonamassa's cds and this one is one of my favorites. Beth Hart is amazing. When she sings &#34;I'd rather go blind&#34; it gives you goose bumps. Everyone who I play this for is blown away. GET THIS. You can thank me later.
B005PK5C12|5.0|Definitely worth the watch.  It had my wife so hooked that we watched the whole season back to back in one day. Give it a go.  It might not be for everyone, but it was for me.  Enjoy!
0446580848|5.0|I selected it because I have read all of DeMille's novels, including The Lion, and have never been disappointed. I hope he doesn't run out of big cats. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspensful stories told with a wry sense of humor.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There are many books written on Near Death Experiences (NDEs).  Proof of Heaven is written by a neurosurgeon who was a skeptic before his own experience.  Dr. Alexander's credentials adds a measure of credibility that most others do not.  I found his book to be a very easy read.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in Heaven or NDEs.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I pre ordered the blu ray copy of this film over a month ago. Yet it won't arrive until a week after it hits stores. What is the point of pre ordering a product if you're not going to get it the same day it comes out? Isn't that the point?<br /><br />Great film though. Love TDKR.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|I can't believe people getting on about how the songs sound. I can care less, I would listen to morten sing names from any phonebook. When A-ha retired a couple of years ago I was afraid that any of them were ever going to put out a cd again. So anyone reading the reviews just know that it's worth buying and be glad that there's a new cd from one of the greatest singers even... `nough said.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Swift moving story, though it ends rather abruptly . If is Jan keeping with the series pattern, good story line that comes together in a jump at the end.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Will Grayson Will Grayson is both drop dead funny, and poignant.  Perhaps that is a reflection of the two very different Will Grayson's.  The best description of this book is bitter-sweet.  Except the bitter is very very bitter and the sweet is very very sweet.<br /><br />First thing you should know is this is NOT the story of  two people meeting with the same name, and oh they both look a like and they switch places and Disney-esc comedy ensues.  IT IS NOT THAT STORY.<br /><br />You should also know there is lot's of rough language and mostly adult humor.  I feel sorry for the teens who's parents I see giving this book a bad review because it has 'that word in it'.  Or because there are gay characters in the book.  I can't imagine what kind of mind numbing sheltered lives there parents must force them to live.<br /><br />Both Will Grayson's have similar but very different problems.  Then there is Tiny Cooper, possibly one of the most memorable characters created in recent literary history.  Each chapter alternates between the two Wills, but make no mistake you won't be confused between the two!  The two Wills are written by two different authors with very different styles.  Their lives eventually intertwine. (No spoiler, that's in the official description.)  And that moment I will tell you is one you will remember for a long time to come!  To those who say that one of the Will's is too depressing, I would say that that is the whole point of that character and the lessons that are learned at the end.<br /><br />The drop dead funny quotes never stop coming.  And it all leads to a story that is funny, sad, heartfelt,  poignant and as I said bitter-sweet, but with an ending that will leave you very satisfied.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great Movie! I am very happy with this purchase. Watch the previous movies before hand and this movie will be soo much better.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|I got this for my son's fifth birthday and he absolutely loved it. It has some great character pieces (the droids R2-D2 and C3P0) and he really enjoyed putting it together. It was neither too easy for him to assemble nor too difficult. It was perfect!

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really liked the game. It's very fun and enjoyable. I am looking forward to the next game. good times.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I love this TV Show and it was in great condition when I got it. I definitely would recommend this to someone! Nothing to dislike about this product!
B005VPRG10|5.0|I got this for my son's fifth birthday and he absolutely loves it! He's clearly under the recommended age range, and i sat with him while he assembled it and he had no problems. On a couple of the steps where you had to do something twice, he did one side while i did the other side so it wouldn't take so long. But he really enjoyed putting this together, i really enjoyed helping, and he loves playing with it!
B002M85TF4|5.0|Rented this classic musical in HD to watch on Xbox - what a treat.  My 18 year-old loves the CD but had not seen the movie. There she was singing along of course knowing all the words better than me. Robert Preston was wonderful and so animated in all his singing and dancing moves.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I took a chance on this as the description was intriguing. So very glad I did! Every character is vibrantly alive and unforgettable, and many found their way into my heart. (This is one of those books I will probably think about for a long time.) Devoid of trite, lazy plot devices or predictable developments--so refreshing, thoughtful and straightforward, I never felt manipulated or underestimated as a reader. Superb story development that delivered consistently intriguing surprises that in retrospect, always made beautiful sense. Very thought-provoking and simultaneously disturbing, riveting and enjoyable to read (I NEEDED to know what happened to these people!). A quiet, unobtrusive narrative voice; unique story concept (in my experience anyway); and effective mingling of familiar and &#34;futuristic&#34; elements--mostly familiar, which made it much easier to lose myself in the convincing realness of the scenario, and no impenetrable made-up futuristic jargon (sometimes &#34;science fiction&#34; works have so much pseudo-science lingo in them you don't even know what you're reading but this had none of that). I will definitely look for more of this author to read, and I highly recommend this series (and I'm finicky with a short attention span and no patience for arty farty pretense so that's saying something.)
B004U52VPS|4.0|I got this as a gift, it is great quality and came in great condition! Its what I expected! I would definitely recommend this to someone!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Yep, Worth having it. Great show. My wife suggested and I was at first weary, but I cannot believe how much I loved the show.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Edward Norton plays another genius role. It is very suspenseful and entertaining. Almost as god as my favorite Norton movie, The Painted Veil.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it. very fun and I highly suggest you download this real time strategy game. you earn money even when your not directly in the game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|ok well it is great to keep little ones and keep them occupied for hours its nice for car rides and places where they need to be quite
0307155102|4.0|I remember many happy hours reading this wonderful book with my son who is now 36! It was one of his very favorites and I feel it was instrumental in helping him with his vocabulary and the ability to read at an early age, along with some other aids. It was interesting to read the comments from others who found parts missing from the original book and now I know what to expect when I read this book with my grandson who is about to be born, in about 6 days!!! I hope reading this with him will bring back happy memories for me and create new ones with my grandson.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I gave this as a gift. My niece was very excited. I had hoped it would include season 3 but it was still a great gift.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|From the first show I have been hooked. The Walking Dead is TV at its best. I always finish a show wanting more.
0142000655|5.0|Great book!  I read it almost 30 years ago and just this week re-read it.  It's a timeless, wonderful piece of literature.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I find Ellie Goulding's songs to be quite an emotional and powerful compared to other songs. I got this album because I enjoyed her first Album Lights. Her voice is able to the convey the emotion the song is wanting to get across. She does not too use much electronics to alter her voice compared to other artists in the same genre Allowing to further pass the message she is wanting to get across. One of my favorite songs is figure 8 because it talks about the ups and downs of love. It gets a person thinking and I am sure we can all relate to her music in some way. I would recommend to people wanting to listen to music with more meaning and a different experience!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater and we ended up being the youngest people in the theater. Great movie!
0345803507|5.0|This was the most shocking, and interesting book I have read in years.  Couldn't put it down.  It has traveled through my family and their friends and is still traveling.  A compelling read.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|A lush, colorful complex video, well made  and thoroughly enjoyable.  Watch it over and over, each time finding a nuance I missed before.  Would recommend this without reservation.  Superb acting.
B000E8N690|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix was perfect in the role of Johnny Cash. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was an excellent portrait of the singer and his life.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Disney classic that comes with both a blue-ray and regular DVD so you can play at home, in the car, in whatever player you own.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Even though I like Amanda Seyfried, I didn't care for the movie. It had some good twists, but didn't keep my interest.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|It's smart and current.You feel like part of the investigation team looking for clues and using email and attachments on a computer just like real life.Graphics are good,without being childish. it's challenging to find hidden objects and interactive by solving puzzles with the computer and progress is interesting.Can't wait to find out who did it!
0553801473|5.0|Can't wait for book 6 and 7. A Clash of Kings is my favorite in the series so far. I recommend these books to anyone nature enough to handle the content.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Classic disney movie that comes with a blu-ray and a regular DVD.  That way no matter which type of player you have, you can watch.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|What a wonderful twist to an old story. I truely loved this movie... the diecting, the acting, the visual effects,.....everything
1410445224|5.0|I got this as a gift for my father and got it in LARGE print. He's so enjoyed this biography, it's an amazing American story.
145210655X|5.0|This is a must have for any dad who is a big Star Wars fan. The art in the book is really great.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Part of a series of books. They are very long and take awhile to get through, but worth it.  If you are interested in fantasy and/or midievil times with lots of twists and turns these books are for you.
B007G3H8Y0|3.0|I have a lot of Train's music, but I don't feel the desire to want to hear this one over and over.Sad to say...
B000HC2PCM|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. HIS MUSIC HAS INSPIRED SO MANY IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS. HE IS CLASSIC.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|We enjoy listening to this CD.  Susan has a mellow yet memorable voice.  The band has quality string playing and backup sound.
B000083E79|2.0|Cher is my all time favorite and this Cd is great but the Cd casing itself was cracked and the Cd was not effected but it would have been nice if the case wasn't broken.
B007MAETA8|4.0|It seems he just never runs out of energy or words... he knows his music and how to put it across....
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Although I found the book profound in many ways, I had trouble following the time line and the premise of the story. The ending was confusing, too and too abrupt. Overall, there were parts I could not put the book.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I love Kimbra's voice. This is the best music i've heard in a long time. Original. I can't say enough good about this album and the content. Kimbra  is hotter than Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie combined! My favorites are Settle Down and Cameo Lover. I love the whole Album. When I heard her sing in Gotye's 'Somebody that I Use to Know' i had to find out who she was. When I found out her name I checked her out on Youtube and was floored with her singing and her voice. I happen to love the album despite the water haters. I love Kimbra live and her Album. She is so beautiful to watch when she sings too. I can't wait for her next album.
B000002LFZ|4.0|Great Cd,Perfect no compains about this one.Every song I could ever want is in this Cd.So very happy Thanks Amazon.
6304602979|5.0|This has always benn one of my all time faves. Wild, zany, violent , romantic, and comical. Cristian Slater and Patricia Arquette are badass.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome season and episode! Can't believe we have to wait until February to find out what happens to Merle and Darryl!?!?
B004G6009U|5.0|Plan for Santa to bring this to my 3 yr old daughter who loves Disney movies. She will be very happy this Christmas.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book really makes you think. It is a book that everyone should read, hopefully it will make more think about how they treat others.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I get it. It's a male dance club, but the story sucked. The acting sucked ( and I'm a big Matthew M. and Channing Tatum fan) but I didn't care for Matthew in this at all. And movies using the F word constantly really turn me off.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Once I got my stylus I was able to play & I'm having a great time playing especially since this is one of my favorite games.<br />Couldn't play until I got the stylus, but I'm learning.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Plan for Santa to bring this to my 3 yr old daughter who loves Disney movies. She will be very happy this Christmas.
B00062J02Q|1.0|I am ticked off! I ordered this strictly because it showed the aspect ratio was 1.33:1, the disc they actually send you is the 2.35:1. I hate that super widescreen crap. I think i should get a refund. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Even though some parts of this movie might be a little iffy for some children, I like how the story says believe in yourself and stand up for what you believe in.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I have been using Weathe+ since last Feburary, with varying degrees of success. On occasions it can not update the weather for several days. That was barely adequate, but now it has not been able to update since 21 November 2012. I have sent two emails to the developer and have received no responses. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON AN UNSUPPORTED PRODUCT. One star is one star too many.
0307730697|5.0|it brings u up from birth, it's almost a motivational book as well.  very little war talk.  i suggest to everyone
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I was first told of this book I said that's not something I would want to read but many of my friends said it was not to be missed.  Not to be missed is exactly right.  A definite read to the very end.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I have a great deal of Bonnie Raitt's music. This one proves that she just keeps getting better and better...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good story, good graphics, just hard enough, and long enough for the price. Additionally, it's also a little scary, which I dig. Great game.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|This movie is a great Christmas family movie. It is a classic that I can watch over and over again.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Absolutely amazing grasp and understanding of the 19th century fairy tale style.  Wonderfully told fairy tale.  It does have a bit of an adult theme so I would rate it PG 13 depending on the child.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All three movies are great. I think I like The Dark Knight the best... Heath Ledger at his best. I can see a sequel in the making....
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Couldn't uninstall fast enough. This thing is a crappy version of farkle plain and simple.<br /><br />If you find the game intuitive or original you need to get your head examined.<br /><br />Game play is slow. Facebook gives san integration error message too.<br /><br />You MUST sign in to play as well.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a valuable and easy way to listen to your favorite stations wherever you are. I love this app and I hope that you do as well.<br />Best 99 cents ever invested!!! I find it hard to believe I'm sitting here in the Florida sunshine listening to 96.3 classical from Toronto and in the great stereo sound of the kindle fire. Your favorite stations stay on while you read your book or check your email. THANKS!!! Love this app.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|This isn't a concert. It's a collection of moments from the rehearsal of the tour M.J. was about to do before he passed on. The choreography and songs are amazing as you would expect. This also gives you a little insight into what M.J. was like on an average day; if you can call any of his days average. He is very gentle and soft spoken. Kind of surprising considering the intensity of the performances he gave. This is a great DVD loaded with classic tunes. Whether you are a casual M.J. fan or a long time follower, this is a fun experience!
0784011710|5.0|I know I had seen this movie back when it came out, but had forgotten alot. Definitely one of Meryl Streep's best ever...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Lines from this movie have made it into household responses.  Highly unusual movie, but and unexpectedly hilarious. Pedro for President!
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This app quit after two days. Get the WEATHER CHANNEL app instead. I would rate this a big fat zero if it were allowed.<br />Opps ... it's now working some of the time and when it is,<br />it does what they say it will ... so I raised my rating to 3 stars<br />OK.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is the live performance of the Metropolis 2000 album. The sound and picture quality is great. This is an amazing performance. There are also some extra songs from some of the earlier albums. If you like Dream Theater, you will like this DVD.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I just like all the different instruments and the vocals even though some of the words are a bit hard to understand.
