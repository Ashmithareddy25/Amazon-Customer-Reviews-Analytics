B0068RHGJM|5.0|Nightwish is my favorite artist, and this album just made it more so. It is an excellent addition to their awesome collection.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The science in this book gave amazing life to the story. The author really did his homework. If you love science and space, this is perfect for you. It really gets into detail and I loved every second of it. Strongly recommend.
0765325950|5.0|I have read every single Wheel of Time book, and this ended the series very well. I believe this is exactly what Robert Jordan had envisioned for the ending before his unfortunate passing.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Well-timed off-beat humor and great singing make this a fun (in not substantial) film.  For a light evening, this will do the trick.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game very fun and exciting I like that there are different upgrades and the graphics are awesome, my three year old loves it too!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love it so good it is like completely creepy though that little girl freaks me out and then the moms journal so freaky
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan, but have never really got into dystopian future novels.  A while back I had read the description of Wool, but it never really stood out as all that interesting sounding to me.  After a time however, it kept rising to the top every time I sorted the Kindle Store's sci-fi section by rating.  Finally I figured, it's only a few bucks for the whole series, why not.  I was blown away by the books.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, the story is full of unexpected shifts, and overall it's just really well done.  I had real trouble putting the book down before I finished it.  I can't say exactly why I loved it so much, but all the positive elements came together perfectly and I found a new book to go on my favorites shelf.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I really like the normal website but the functionality through the app is lacking. I couldn't do certain things I wanted to get done, which was disappointing
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Excellent mixture of diverse characters and themes that woven through each episode.  The subtle nuance comments make for a good laugh.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Excellent movie, with only a touch of a complaint here and there with a few tiny things. That dog model creeped me out. But everything else was fantastic. A sweet little movie with the sort of feel Disney used to have in the 90's. I'd watch a sequel if they made one. Good work, Dreamworks, and to the writer of the original books, William Joyce.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Recently watched with my wife and 20 year old daughter..... and she loved it.<br /><br />One classic movie that everyone has to watch
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I bought a Pandigital Android tablet from TigerDirect on which I was able to read my Kindle books.  It broke fairly quickly and Pandigital is out of business.  Guess it wasn't the deal I thought it was.  No support for that device.<br />So I went to a discount store and got a d2 brand Android tablet.  It's been months and several contacts with Kindle support and all I get when I try to open a book is a blank white page.  I'm feeling very disappointed, because this is the first time I have had a problem with any kind of Amazon support.  I have an old Kindle Keyboard and a laptop and Kindle is fine on both.  Except a book I bought for the Kindle device was missing the illustrations that were on the preview.  I'm becoming disallusioned.  Been buying real books.  Which always have all the pages.  And don't hurt as much when I drop them on my face in bed.  At least most of them don't.
0767812166|5.0|I did not watch this one. It was given to someone as a gift. I watch it in Blu-ray format
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Absolutely the best show ever.  It is light, comical and interesting.  I watch it over and over again.  Truly a feel good show.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Bought this for my grandaughter so when she comes to my house we can watch it together. Would recommend this to other people as well.
B000BM61UU|2.0|It was totally misleading...I thought it would be partially assembled but had to be made from scratch. Not what I wanted...
B008OURHPY|5.0|LOVE her voice. Love this album. I like Adele but I LOVE Lianne La Havas. Outstanding. Nice to hear a strong voice of a young woman that isn't all about a broken heart. Lianne deserves all the praise that Adele gets about her vocals in my opinion. THIS is a voice I can really get excited about. Her harmonies, her tone, her vibrato. Just wonderful.
B0000251VZ|4.0|If this was maidens debut it would've gotten 5 stars from me. But number of the beast and piece of mind are so over the top incredible that I can only give it 4 fairly. For newer Maiden fans don't forget to check out first 2 albums with Paul Diano singing. 5 star gems themselves and a much faster, looser vibe from band
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bought Skyfall as the final installment to the 50th Anniversary Edition.  If you enjoy Bond - this is a must have!
B004KPX5GC|5.0|A very enjoyable true movie, One for the whole family to enjoy. Boys will even like it, along with their sisters.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best headset I've ever head. But considering I've only ever had worthless Turtle beaches..we can see why. I can say this is probably one of the best, little more &#34;intense gamer&#34; headset for a pretty low price. And also comes with a few more features other than just sound, like some competing products.<br /><br />PROS:<br />  Great sound, basically noise canceling.<br />  Amazing comfort. After a few uses the headset will mold to your head and fit perfectly<br />  Steel frame. So you know its not going to just break when you stretch it to put it on your head. Especially nice for people with big heads.<br />  The mic has great quality, and does a great job of picking up just your voice instead of other noises in the room. I'm not saying it's going to cancel out blasting music, but little things it will.<br />  Easy to change settings. Just install their software, and you can change anything from the volume of the mic, to the how you sound. I mean you can sound like a robot, zombie, a man with a deep voice, or a little girl. Really fun to play with and confuse friends.<br /><br />Not really sure if this is a pro or con, for being a wireless head set I'd look at it as a pro but, the head set will last about 2 and a half to 3 hours on battery. And takes about 2 hours to fully charge. The software you install will tell you how much longer till fully charged, and how much longer the battery will last. And if you're not paying attention it will beep at you. And not just a minute before it's about to die. It'll beep at you about 10-15 min before, so you have time to plug it in.<br /><br />CONS:<br />  The dongle to plug in your computer is a bit flimsy and poorly made. I've had to tape mine because its about to break. Not very convenient if you're using a laptop.<br />  The programmable G keys are not very programmable. I can open iTunes...and change a song, but that's about it.<br />  It's a little big when you have it on, and makes you look kind of funny.<br /><br />I love the product and have no regrets buying it. I strongly recommend it to people who are gaming because the surround sound is beautiful and the mic works fantastic. I use it for when I'm playing my MMO's to talk to people.y.<br /><br />I love the product and have no regrets buying it.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|It's better just to buy them all at one time.  I looked into piecing together their collection CD by CD, but this made more sense.
B005C8ENI0|1.0|I am new to Amazon Prime. I chose The Lincoln Lawyer as my first movie to view. Unfortunately closed caption was not available for this video via Amazon and I had to find the movie elswhere so my husband could enjoy it also.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy and I like it I have an account it makes it so much easier and convenient to use then to go on the net and search
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I don't just like this whole album because Bruno Mars is attractive and has a great voice. I love this album because the songs are well written, and rather relatable. Each tune is catchy in it's own right and over all the album is quite strong.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it.<br />Can't wait to read the next book. I will ad soon as I find out how to return this one.
B0000696I0|4.0|As part of my 20 years ago series I thought that I would go & review all 3 films before doing a review for the 3rd movie & all 3 movies are on You  t  u  be. This is a review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret Of The Ooze. I haven't seen this movie or the 1st since 01 or 02 before then when I was younger I used to watch both TMNT 1 & II as often as I could. I mean I loved both live action movies & tried to collect all the action figures when I was younger I like the 80's cartoon when USA showd back when USA had a cartoon line up I don't know if they do anymore. As for the 3rd movie I remeber seeing it on VHS like in 93 or 94  remember not liking it. Anyway Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II was made on a budget of $25 million made $78 million. Directed by Michael Pressman this is the only movie that I have seen of his however he is a producer on Law & Order & Blue Bloods which I think Blue Bloods is the best Cop show on TV right now. There has been actress & actors that have been replaced April O'Neil is now played by Paige Turco & Francois Chou takes over as Shredder. As weel a couple of the voice actors have changed Raphael is now voiced by Laurie Faso & Donatello is voiced by Adam Carl now. Leif Tilden & Michelan Sisto stayed on as Donatello & Michaelanglo. Raphael is now played by Ken Tourm, Leonard is now played by Mark Caso. Kevin Clash still voices Splinter. The voice actors for Leonardo & Michaelanglo are still vocied by Robbie Rist & Brian Tochi.  Also stars Ernie Reyes jr as Keno, Toshishiro Obata as Tatsu, Mark Ginthar as Rahzar, Kurt Bryant as Tokka & David Warner as Professor Jordan Perry. The strory is pretty much a straight forward sequel sometime after the 1st movie you open up to New York City & for some reason everyone has a craving for pizza you are introduced to this kid named Keno who works a Pizza Delivery Boy he asks these girls out & they tell him in your dreams he comes back with a good 1 yeah I'll do that & maybe I'll dream about someone thinner than you. The movie went more for a lighthearted cheesy tone due to parents complaining about the violence in the 1st movie. Which the campier direction might be bad but it works it's not like Batman & Robin which had humor that made your stomach turn. Anyway Keno comes across some guys robbing a store he beats them up & then more of these thugs show up then The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arrive & I have always remembered this part the turtles go into jump kick stance it freezes & flashes the title screen the turtles proceed whoop these thugs. This is just a fun opening. They tie up the robbers tells Keno to call the cops & they take the pizza's they he was suppose to deliver but they did pay for them. The turtles live with April O'Neil in her new apartment. Tatsu has now taken over The Foot Clan but Shredder returns he wants revenge. Meanwhil April O'Neil resports on this story about The Techno Global Reserch Industries wherea a scientist named Jordan Perry is cleaning up an area that has been contaminated from their chemicals you have this guy named Freddy how works for the station & he also is spying on April. Professor Perry finds some dandelions that have grew due to the toxic waste. Freddy tells Shredder about it & later that night Tatsu & some Foot Soldiers have captured Professor Perry when he had destroyed all but 1 of the containers of The Ooze. Splinter tells the turtles about where the canister of ooze came from he show that it came from TGRI. So they go to check it out where they't met by a bunch of Foot Soldiers. They try to stop Tatsu from leaving with the ooze ultimatly they fail in stoping him. Then at April's Aprartment Keno delivers some pizza's he finds out who the turtles are & he decides to help them by posing as a new recuit for The Foot Clan. The turtles find this old abandoned Subway that they use as their new home. Raphael goes out for a walk where he joins up with Keno. Keno gets in The Foot Clan sp Raphael can find out where their new hideout is at. While they're escaping Raphael spot Shredder. then they bump into Tatsu. Raphael tries to fight them off but he is captured Keno runs off to tell the others what's going on. Meanwhile Shredder has Professor Perry use the ooze to make some creatures Tatsu brings in an Alligator Snapping Turtle & a Wolf. The Snapping Turtle is mutated into Tokka & The Wolf becomews Rahzar. Who at 1st aren't all there originally the producers wanted Bebop & Rocksteady from the cartoon but the original writers of the comic book were against it. Anyway Tokka & Rahyzar think that Shredder is their Mom & they hug him which was funny. Shredder watns them killed Professor Perry tells him you can't kill them they're living creatures. Since he sees how strong they are he decides that they are useful after all. Donatello, Michaelanglo & Leonardo go to the junkyard where they fall into a trap they're caught in this net Spliter fires a bow & arrow & cuts the rope they free Raphale & fight The Foot Clan Shredder has Tokka & Rahyzar go after the turtles. Michaleanglo says \\"Didn't we see these guys on Wrestlemania?\\" They get owned by these new monsters. Donatello is thrown by 1 of the creatures & he falls into 1 of the warehouses where he finds Professor Perry. Michaelanglo finds a manhole when he was thrown to the ground by 1 of the creatures they all make their escape. Tokka tries to follow them but is stuck in the hole Michaelanglo decides to have some fun & tickle Tokka's feet. I did get a laugh ou tof that. Shredder lets Tokka & Rahzar loose they knock down some telphone poles & crush some cars. The next sday Freddy reveals that he is working with The Foot Clan to April he tells her to tell the turtles if they don't meet Tokka & Rayzar at the construction site then Shredder will let them loose in Centeral Park. Professor Perry comes up with serium that can mutate Tokka & Rayzar back. They go to the construction site they try to trick Tokka & Rahzor but putting the erium tablets into donuts. Leonardo says we would like to have the traditional pre fight donut. But they find the cubs in the donuts. The turtles get roughed up their fight goes all the way into this dance club where Vanilla Ice is performing the look & feel is totlally early 90's. Everybody thinks it's part of the show 1 of them say that they love the costume's. The turtles try to fight Tokka & Rahzar Vanilla Ice singing \\"Go ninja go ninja go.\\" Professor Perry shows up he tells Donatello that C 0 2 will get the serium to work so Donatello & Leonardo grab some fire extinguishers Raphael & Michaelanglo use these barrels to knock Tokka & Rahzar down Leonardo & Donatello spray the fire extinguishers into Tokka & Rahzar's mouths & they return to their normal forms. You have all 4 turtles on stage getting down. Keno decides to help the turtles. Shredder shows up & he has the last canister of ooze Keno shows up & kicks the canister of ooze out of his hand. Shredder takes a girl & threatens to use a small vial of ooze on her. Donatell turns the speakers up to full blast Michaelanglo plays a keytar & the force is so great that it throws Shredder out of the club & outside into the river. I lmao on that. They go out & look for Shredder who took the ooze & has became Super Shredder played by former Pro Wrestler Kevin Nash. Basically he breaks the support on the dock & ends up crushing himself to death. I would've liked a longer fight with The Turtles & Super Shredder but what am I going to do about it they had to tone the violence down. The turtles go home Splinter shows a newspaper with them fighting & he makes them tdo 30 backflips he says \\"Go ninja go ninja go.\\" TMNT II is a good sequel  I would put in the class with Robocop 2 & Predator 2 not as good as the 1st but comes close. The costumes & animatronics are still top quality by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The more cheesy tone works. You still have the family unit vibe. Michael Pressman did a very good job. John Du Prez'sscore isn't as good as the 1 he did for the 1st film but it's ok. Francois Chou did a pretty good job. Toshishiro Obata was there he was ok. Paige Turco did a good job. Ernie Reyes jr was good. David Warner did a pretty good job. Mark Caso, Michaelan Sisti Leif Tilden & Ken Tourm did fine. Brian Tochi , Robbie Rist, Adam Carl & Laurie Faso did a good job providing the voices. Only a couple of minor things hold it back from being as good as the 1st but a solid sequel overall. Next wiill be 20 years ago Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III.
072325804X|5.0|I didn't really expect much with this one, but when I received it, I was just amazed how beautifully illustrated it was.<br />Great collection of stories with just amazing pictures to capture your little ones' imagination.<br />I can't wait to read it to my son and then to my daughter in a year or two.
B008M7JODC|4.0|Truth is the show is engaging and entertaining.  A little predictable at times and yet methodical and with many twists.<br /><br />Can't seem to stop watching it and I've heard season 2 is much better.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|This movie touches on areas that some folks are afraid to approach.  There IS life after death and we have angels watching over us all the time.  They did a very good job of relaying this in this film.  Since my husband has passed, I've experienced several things that only he could have done.  He let's me know he's fine all the time.  This film was made with tenderness and compassion...one of my all time favorites.  And I'm a huge movie fan.
B002BGCCZC|5.0|Before, I really did not listen to Muse that at all till I met one of my friends. He would play butterflies and hurricanes on the piano and it sounded amazing. He told me to really listen to this album. That I would love it. Sure enough, I did. Great album. Great band.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved the first Temple Run and I love this one. Olny problem I am experiencing is that I can not back out, exit or quit the game. I have to hit the home button on my phone in order to get out
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very fun. It is a great time killer app and the definite choice for horse lovers. The game has great graphics that are much better than the other horse game apps. There will be an occasional add but otherwise no glitches. Over all its a good game for all ages.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was really excited when I found out Ang Lee signed on to direct this amazing movie. The book is incredible! I could not put it down. The movie is amazing, Lee did a fantastic job bringing this book to life. The shipwreck scene is amazing I felt like like I was there (seriously, I panicked because I thought I was drowning!). If you have scene Brokeback Mountain and if you're not a close-minded bigot, you of course loved it, one of the best romance movies of all time. You'll love this movie, Lee has a niche doing in-depth meaningful movies.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Plays good interesting story but it didn't take long to finish and playing again would be even shorter but still fun
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was engrossing and enjoyable.  It reminded me a bit of Major Pettigrew's Last Stand.  I thought it was heartwarming and struck a chord.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun for about 10 min until it gets completly boring and i dont play it very often
B009FZFONO|4.0|Well it was a very good episode. Though the governor not cool. I got a funny feeling it's not going to turn out the way anyone expects. I did hope that the meeting would bring positive change.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game its so much fun and i play it every day for a while!!!<br /><br />Its a good game and i really recommend it!
B00A83075M|5.0|Great movie for the kids. Has a good lesson to teach and perfect for a family movie night. My kids loved it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game and I think you will to. It's addicting and I highly HIGHLY recommend it it's so fun!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I liked her sharp eye for detail and sharp ear for dialogue. Good plot that unravelled at the very end with a cop-out ending.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Started out a skeptic the first couple episodes but by the middle and end of the season I was hooked
B00571F26Y|4.0|Bottom line is, do his ideas work?  I started his diet immediately and felt the benefits within a few days. Admittedly I felt bludgeoned by too much data towards the end, but who cares? It just makes sense and it works.
B003IDMUTK|5.0|Great reading. Had me hooked in first few pages, Read the book on a 4 hour flight. Good stuff. Thanks
B00364K6YW|5.0|It was perfect!  I had borrowed one and wanted my own. It was just as I expected and I have watched it many times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had a great time playing the game and it is very boss<br />It was the beat game I've played that was very good I have to say it is the best
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book!!! I LOVE the characters and how they interact, it feels like I watching their relationship grow!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I am having fun with this multi level game - it can be a challenge to get all the stars on each item
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game!!! Needs to make it easier to get gems though, other than that it's fun. Recommend it to everyone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book, great suspense, great characters.  I've never read a Grisham book that wasn't good.  Can't wait for his next book.
B0094K1K8I|5.0|I liked this one just as much as the first, maybe more. I love watching these shows at night by myself. I don't get scared easily but these shows do the job.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I was worried about this when I read all the reviews, but was excited to listen since EC is one musician I have utmost respect for. I thought it was highly enjoyable and then realized I shouldn't be surprised at all that most people just don't \\"get it.\\" EC is at the point where he gathers his friends and makes awesome music that HE wants to make with songs HE wants to play. No more labels telling him what to do or catering to fans that want to hear more Cream albums...and he can still sell a ridiculous number of copies. The joy and passion in which EC follows his own passions comes through and makes for a success. The music is quality and expertly executed with great respect paid to each song during the process. Thanks EC, can't wait for crossroads. Long story short...if  you have been following EC throughout his career, this album should not be strange to you at all and I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a mind-blowing blues scorcher, you may not \\"get\\" where he is in his life right now, not that that's necessarily a bad thing (different strokes and all). No matter how you feel about the album, DO see him live... he still is (and always will) be the man.
0345803493|5.0|I loved, loved this trilogy and this was my favorite of the 3. The third could've been worked into this 1.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|It is so amazing how much grace there can be in a book about honor. I do think DW missed a great deal in the ending of this  book. There could have been another chapter or ,so added to this book.<br /><br />dray
0345803507|4.0|I think she struggled to write a third book.  The third could've been worked into the second.  ETHIER WAY I LOVED THESE BOOKS!
B000ADWDF2|5.0|I love this movie! ALL the actors portray each character with so much heart!! It is unbelieveable! I'm very happy I bought it!

B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty is one of our favorites.  We were on his bandwagon from the first on Idol we love his deep voice
B001UTW7QU|5.0|the Fringe series is a cross between X-Files and the Time Machine. I was hooked from the start. The acting is brilliant. The writing is inspired. I do love J.J. Abrahams work. Try watching it. You must watch and not be distracted. Keep an open mind when you watch this program. It's a wild ride from start to finish. If you like a good mystery, a science Fiction and adventure film all in one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's awesome. Nothing more needs to be said.  Watch it, love it, be sad when the season ends. . .
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great no BS autobiography of a true American hero.<br /><br />RIP Chris, your untimely death was a loss to our country.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Finally there is a great resource which collates as much research as possible that was disregarded by the medical community in their continued quest to champion the calories in / calories out theory of fat gain and/or loss.<br />This is an easy to read and easy to understand resource and should be read by anyone interested in their body and why it gains fat!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie....I mean, my kids really enjoyed this movie. I bought the HD version (I can watch it again and again online, on my TV, or iPad) and the quality if great!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Wonderful read. The way the names of the flowers blended their meaning with the relationships with the characters was exciting and mysterious. This book shows the intricate way nature can play such an important part in our life both past and present . I recommended this book to everyone who loves an entangled story of sincere and passionate love.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|i adore not only bobby singer but the man behind the character jim beaver and as you read it you can hear his voice and mannerisms - fun fun read

B002C4YYEU|5.0|Such an emotional movie! Almost makes you feel like it happened in real life. If you haven't watched this you're missing out!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. Our whole family is hooked. It's more about people and personal interactions than zombies.
B005QUQP76|5.0|It is an excellent mouse, using it took over 1 year and works great. It is perfect for FPS game, I personally buy to play Combat Arms (Online Game FPS) and operates great. Its futuristic styling makes it look like another world, all who see it love it. I recommend 100% their quality is extremely good, above buy mice Microsoft, Logitech and G.Electric and did not last long, it seems they were not made ​​for gamers though he preached. I love my Corsair M60.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead! Derl is sooo hot! Great season. so far and great picture quality. can't wait for next seasons!!!!!!
B000O8OTNC|1.0|would not buy again, the knife sharper works at the beginning but then starts to dull and cant even cut plastic wrap....
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is an intriguing plot and good read with Bosch trying to solve a cold case murder that happened during the LA riots in the 90s.  He is his usual conflicted, and sometimes ornery self, but somewhat softened with his daughter in the picture now.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink is a genius who find nucleus of human nature. I would recommend amazon friends this book, To sell is Human, as a best work of him.  My view on human life is significantly deepened thanks to his abundant and unique insights of this book.

B003Y059EK|5.0|awesome movie. Lots of Oz stories out there, and this one is great and everyone should watch it at least once. 'Nuff said.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Page turning, typical Jeffery archer, love the twists and turns he weaves in his stories. Start at book 1 and you won't be able to put them down!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a pretty cool game. the horses don't actually move realistically. though. and it's a huge file download so it doesn't go quick.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the kind of book that when you pick it up you just don't want to lay it down!! Wish I had more time to read!!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|I enjoy the realtionship and interaction between Holmes and Watson. Good chemistry between the actors. Holmes' addiction is a welcome twist to the genre. Waiting for Watson to some into her own, so I'm sticking around until Second 2 to see how it plays out.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider solitaire is challenging but a lot of fun! I have only tried it with one color so far... I'll be brave soo!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this story.  The chapters rotated the narrator, so you approached the lives of the characters through different eyes.  When you don't want a book to end, you know it was well-written.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The story pulls you in and keeps your interest throughout. The characters are well rounded and complete and the situations make sense. They are well written and intelligent.  Good reading!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story line. Very well done. You feel as though you know each character . A great insight into British culture.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best James Bond movies, yet. First 20 minutes will, keep you on edge. DVD is excellent! Sound/video are perfect!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|An excellent book<br />I c rose this because as I already said  it is an excellent book but the ending was a hang on.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Great storyline, great writing,great idea. Made me think. I couldn't stop reading! I can't wait to start part two of this series.
1616550414|5.0|I simply love it. The draws are so amazing and I really enjoy all the history behind this great series
B008QTV3X0|1.0|Amazon streaming was intolerably bad, for days in my home. It ruined the experience of this pilot.  I switched over to VUDU and watched this show in reflect HD with no issues.  Amazon, your streaming problems have lost you my business.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Nice to be able to see my facebook other than at home.  Really like it when my mom is on my computer.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|I found this movie very entertaining. It provides some good laughs to brighten one's day! I would highly recommend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very helpful....can check my mail when my mom is using the tv, which is my computer, now I can check my emails anytime.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|From the moment this movie began, I was captured. The animation is unbelievable and the story line is exciting and humorous.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have become addicted to this show and the characters. Regretfully I got addicted the year the series ended. Well at least I have all of Fringe on Amazon.
B0014LX420|1.0|Nothing good about this album, the best hits aren't even on here. I'm not a huge Britney fan, but some of her music was catchy.. but this album stinks!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs things like mob eggs, buckets, flint and steel in creative, and a lot of other things.so please put these suggestions in.thanks for the awesome game
B005SAV9SO|2.0|So bad that it was good.  Cameron Diaz swears up a storm.  Everybody is shallow.  Watching this movie for free is okay but paying money for it is kinda disappointing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very well done. We plan to buy it so we can see it again and again. No slow parts. Fast-moving.
B00650SSDU|3.0|This movie was okay and is probably good for girls night out or a solo rom-com for the worst parts of your period.  Very funny.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|While Colin Farrell can deliver, the story was boring, stupid and certainly not faithful to the previous version of Total Recall. I'm guessing this was a financial flop compared to the original movie.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Profound and captivating. Excellent graphics and special effects.  Much more than just a movie about about a boy and a tiger.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was recommended by a friend. We rented it...twice! And then we bought it. Just had to have it. Deep, funny, fast-moving and lots of interesting sides to all the personalities.
1401224792|2.0|I couldn't resist adding another Fables hardcover to my growing collection of Deluxe books, so even after reading the poor reviews I went ahead and bought this anyway...do yourself a favor and skip it. As other reviewers have said the art is lacking and the story is poor. This is the first forgettable entry in the Fables storyline that I've come across :(
B003MS0UHU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the move and plan to buy the series down the road. Well done and kept my interest. Moves right along.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|this book was  very hard to read ...the appalling treatment received by this author from her parents esp. one who enjoyed being a movie star.....if you thought &#34;Mommie Dearest&#34; was terrible  well, nothing compared to this sad story....Shirley MacLaine should be ashamed....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some may consider it belonging to the Teen genre but adults will enjoy and should learn some valuable lessons about living life to its fullest.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks has done an excellent job of being able to clearly impart his vision of all things Z to the reader. If Zombie-fiction/escapist fun is your thing, consider this as essential reading....!
B00002SSKI|5.0|This movie is about friendship and always being there for your friends through thick and thin. It has a lot of laughs too.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Watching this movie in HD was pretty good. Although I don't have a sound system setup at home this would have helped me enjoy the movie much more.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|'Beauty and the Beast' has got to be one of Disney's most popular and classical films of all time. The artwork is beautiful and the songs are wonderful.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|love the action and he he wouldn.t stop on nothing to get his gran daughter nicolas cage is one of the greatest actors
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This band is so freaking uh-maz-ing! And this CD is one of my favorites from them. Who doesn't like at least one song from this CD?
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have stream of consciousness way of thinking. This app makes it possible to collect all those thoughts in one place for later use. Priceless!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is probably the best free weather app for your android tablet.<br />It does give you a lot of info and details.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|First off, this is not a Bruce Willis movie - he is only in a few scenes. More importantly though - this is chock full of lame plotlines, predictable outcomes and scratch you head and go 'huh?' moments. I finished the movie but only because I had already paid for it.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Our family loved this movie! We loved the moral of the story and how we can overcome our fears and insecurities.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I knew I liked the Black Keys from the songs I'd heard before, but this is the first album I purchased.  Love it and can't wait to buy more albums of theirs.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm not sure I exactly understood the entire plot, but I still loved the book simply because John Grisham wrote it.  I finished the book feeling a little confused as to why it ended there, but also amazed at how conniving and clever &#34;Max&#34; was.
B007M45PMU|3.0|I feel like a lot of the songs sound the same.  I would rather give this 2.5 stars, but it might grow on me as I listen to it more. There are a lot of albums that I don't like at first.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I Really like my new LifeProof case, the least favorite thing is that it sometimes my &#34;touch&#34; doesn't take because the screen of the case doesn't lay as flat as i'd like it against the phone screen. But I like the fact that the case is smaller than the otterbox is provides a lot more protection.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a nice change from great love to overcoming obstacles of life and moving forward, I enjoyed this story
B009FZHYKU|5.0|as in oooog i can't watch that oooog i have to or i won't know what happened!  and omg!omg! that zombie is so goopy  and not stopping! ooog!  i am not a horror show, movie fan in the least- i must have my hand held at all scary parts- usually the whole thing.  so, for me to give this show so many ooogs and to have been able to actually watch is meaning that this is an incredible show!  keep up the scary work Dead<br />Folks!
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|The kids loved it! I gave it four stars because the boogy man is a little scary for really young kids.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The main character here has a really difficult life.  She survives on sheer detirmination with help from her love of flowers and the meanings they have.  They become communication means for her when she cannot bring herself to take chances with people.  Very interesting subject especially for anyone involved with gardens, foster children, or intrigued by survival stories.  Loved the setting in San Francisco.
B0030B624E|5.0|I really like this movie because it incorporates comedy, but not in a silly way like Shaun of the Dead. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg make a great team--being polar opposites really sells the idea that very few humans are left alive, since traveling together and making the best of their situation might otherwise be unbearable for them under different circumstances.<br /><br />As I really do not want to review the movie fully, I will say that it is a definite must-watch for any person that even remotely enjoys zombie films.  I have relatively high expectations and semi-eclectic taste when watching movies, so when I can say I like one without reservation, it's likely a decent flick.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but it moves at a snails pace. I'll open it up and do a few things like collect coins from my dinos and buildings and shut it down until next time. And I've been doing that for days. But I say that it's obviously designed for microtransactions is because in order to get the most expensive dinosaurs and buildings either I'm going to be playing for months and months or I sink twenty five dollars into this thing and get it immediately.
0062238868|5.0|I too, unfortunately, only got around to reading Chris Kyles book after hearing of his tragic murder. I knew that our country had lost a genuine hero and patriot before I read it, but after I finished it that thought became even more clear. While, as you can imagine, the book is filled with sniper info and descriptions about the firefights, overwatches for other troops, etc. what grabbed me more and what I appreciated more was his candor in revealing his feelings about what he was doing and who he was doing it to. He made it clear in many places in the book that what he and our troops were encountering in Iraq(and I am sure in Afghanistan and other spots that comprise the a-hole of planet earth) was pure, unadulterated EVIL! Evil that was attempting to kill American troops and needed to be ELIMINATED! He made it clear he was more than happy to send them to whatever \\"paradise\\" they thought they might get to. And send them he did! I can only hope that ALL of our Marines, soldiers, airmen and sailors have this same attitude. As a fellow SEAL of Kyles who was blinded by a gunshot while in Iraq said after the SEALS saved the boat captain in 2009 from pirates...\\"Contrary to what your mother told you, violence does solve problems.\\"
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Sometimes you need a book that is decent to read, keep you interested and not too much of a rattle on the brain.  We as people are always on the move, and sometimes just an entertaining, easy read that still can put you into the scene of the book is all you need.  This book is just that
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Not much to say about one of the best movies ever made ​​in the world. Sergio Leone achieves the apex of Western all'italiana in a single work and operatic.
B003XD7ECI|5.0|I love Helloween, so when I saw Michael Kiske singing with Amanda Somerville, I immediately had to buy this CD!  Amanda has very powerful vocals, and adds a quality contrast to Michael Kiske.  Hopefully these 2 get together again for another album, and tour America!  Great album!  Also, check out Unisosnic as well!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This is just an awesome move- action, romance and fun for the whole family. I totally recommend it and you should add it to your collection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is my favorite way to pin! Nice user interface and easy to navigate. Displays nicely even on a small screen.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Two thumbs up, loved the movie especially watching it with The Avengers. Totally enjoyable for the whole family. Family loves it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the second book anticipation brewing for the third book. I love how the characters have developed and work through what life has handed them.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|All you want after watching this is MORE Downton Abby. Story lines that surprise you and break you heart I watch them on PBS and re watch on the DVD because you miss so much the first time. This way I get the stories and can go back to look at the house :)
0345803507|5.0|So far i have enjoyed the 1st book & now i am unable to put the second book down. I am so glad i learned about this series & would like to read more from this author
B006903GX8|5.0|The mix of background of the period, actors and the house is very well written. I would recommend for all Downton Abby fans.
0345803493|5.0|I so love every book i have read from this author & am looking forward to everything else he writes in the future.<br />I bought all of the series used & i am impressed with the condition as well!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a big fan of all of Michael Connelly's books. This was a Harry Bosch novel that was intriguing and enjoyable!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful, easy to use app. I am a private duty nurse and use it every day on my Kindle Fire.
0525478817|5.0|Green's book pulls no punches.  Though written about (and I believe, for) young adults, it will resonate with and move anyone over twelve, especially if he/she is looking for a loving dose of realism.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I'm not sure what more you could do with a man eating alien space car, but it was over too soon.  Waiting for the sequel, &#34;Mile 82&#34;!
1616550414|5.0|I really enjoyed having this book! I seriously recommend this book to every Zelda fan to have in their collection!
1401937268|5.0|These cards are absolutely beautiful, the coloring is brilliant, the quality of the cards is above average. A must have
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am 70 years young and this game will surely keep me that way!Great for all ages! This will keep you busy for hours;  a must to download ' well worth it!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Bought two more as Christmas gift to my sister and and  cousin. The picture and sound were just amazing !!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Omg! I can not wait till the house of Hades. Seriously, I am almost cried. This book is so dang good, I don't see why anyone would not like this. But you have to read the five Percy Jackson books and the Lost hero and the Son of Neptune, before you read this. This is wayyy better than Harry Potter in my opinion, Harry Potter is too long and doesn't get to the point faster than Rick Riordan' s books. I am very sad I have to wait till I'm am in 6th grade (the fall) to read the House of Hades!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is relaxing. It starts off easy and gradually gets more difficult. I wish the hints weren't so stingy. I can't go on until I finish the level I'm stuck on, and I can't get a hint until I finish a puzzle.  But it's still fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish I could give more stars! When people say this has failed to download, probably because they don't have enough money!<br />Anyways I have this on the pc and if it doesn't let you join a game from the kindle, then try it on the pc or the Xbox! Great game, cannot get better!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Although I wasn't sure what to expect from this story, I found I really liked it! The idea of creating a river for salmon to produce their young and for the joy of fishing for them  in the Yemen is so unique.<br />The people involved in making this happen, as well as their personal lives which undergo major changes makes the story very interesting and enjoyable. This is one I will watch again and again.
B00004W221|5.0|What is there not to like about Rudy! Epitome of a sports movie. A wild ride that has you in cheering one moment, pumped up the next, and then shedding tears after that. It is an unbelievably inspiring movie, and its influence can be seen in nearly all modern sports films. They don't make them like this anymore....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a no nonsense calculator with no additional bells and whistles.  This calculator is simple to use and will be put to good use.
B001EV6GHU|5.0|It is a short book for a person who wants to go directly tothe point, give excellent resources and samples and excellent summary charts to study
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was excellent can't wait to see the movie I have read everyone of his books I would recommend them to who likes to read
B000I9U9A4|5.0|One of Russell Crowes best movies. Couldn't get any better when you buy it on blue ray.Don't get sea sick.
B0093X805W|5.0|Haven't read this for at least 35 years and I still love it!  An  Oldie but a goodie!  Very fond memories of this book.
B00A83075M|3.0|I was expecting so much more from this movie! I wanted clever humor and a better story that children's movies like \\"toy story\\" and \\"cars\\" have included so adults can enjoy a chuckle here and there.On a better note, my children enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Switching from one place in the tour to another makes me download the app fix that and this game is 5 star
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I think anyone who liked 'The curious incident of the dog in the night time' will like 'The Rosie Project'.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. This is the first book that I had read in many years. It started out slow and I wondered if I was going to like it. Once I got into it, I could hardly wait to have more time to read it. I liked the the main character and the humor as well as the story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It fast and easy also when i buy books for my family they receive same in one second. So far so good no problem, no assel
B000FA6720|5.0|The Bridges of Madison County<br />I thought that it was an amazing love story.I finished the book last night and I still can't stop thinking about it. The content kept me interested from beginning to end.  Doris Beattie
B003JTHXOK|4.0|More excitement in this story.  Most of his books are love stories with a little kick.  I really enjoyed this one.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I read this book after I had read the Life of Pi. The story was okay but very depressing for me. I had to make myself read it and when I was through I was very glad to get on with another book.
B00A6D5GBE|2.0|For my granddaughters, making this little sleepy guy walk around is fun and exciting when they make it to the end...but for me, it is just too slow.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|This book was entertaining and it held my interest. It was not a book that I would recommend. I don't know if I would look for another book by Alice Sebold.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This simple case protects my Kindle without excess bulk and props it upright for hands free viewing. A nice size.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is really sweet! it almost seems better than minecraft! But it would be bad to neglect the original game :)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this gamenis really fun to play when you have nothing else to do and I really love it because you can level up your shark
B004MC0FO8|5.0|No complaints here.  I love the fact that  I can find out what song is playing in seconds. Also find useful information about the artist, and even touring dates. Sing along and enjoy!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series pulled me in from the very beginning.  I was only going to watch one episode then ended up buying the entire season.  Can't wait to watch season 2.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I love this game..it's great for one player and even more fun with a friend.  I would recommend this game to everyone ..young, or young at heart. Thanks!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was funny and sad at the same time. It is a good book to read while traveling. I recommend it.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Lovely album, really. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy and slightly brain-dead, as if you just took a hit of acid, except without the neuroses involved with the whole process. Makes for excellent \\"chill-out\\" music. Quite possibly my favorite album at the moment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the characters in this book I loved the suspense the action Did not want this book to end!!!
B008G12ERC|3.0|The teenager inside of me is befuddled. What is this that she's listening to? Some sort of Queen/The Cure hybrid band? Wait, she thinks she heard Muse just now. No, wait, it couldn't be. Could it?<br /><br />Disclaimer: I used to worship Muse. I loved the screaming, the creepy whining, the eerie yet poignant lyrics and the face melting guitar riffs. Ever since \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\", they have been slowly but surely changing their sound and crossing fuzzy genre lines into pop-rock. Good for them, since I'm sure that they're selling many, many, many more records now. I just don't think that I will be picking any more of them up.<br /><br />Not wanting to sound like the much-reviled hipster, but, I liked Muse before they were mainstream. Not because I don't like listening to the same music as everyone and their mothers, but because the music and vibe have changed. Maybe I'm just a sucker for ruckus and pessimism.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.. Mesmerizing...  A wife goes missing and naturally the husband is the major suspect.  Husband? Wife? Other sinister madman? Who is responsible for this situation?  for the relationship??
B004XE0P5E|4.0|Great album to have on in the background when you're trying to lull yourself to sleep or if you're just trying to get some work done. Like right now. Except I'm sitting hunched in front of my computer in the middle of the night writing Amazon reviews instead of starting on the work that I brought home with me...
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This game will keep you busy using your logic to connect a source of liquid to a container using pieces of pipes. If you are good at visualization, you will find this game interesting and challenging.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoy John Grisham books and this is no exception.  It has some interesting plot twists and some suspense. However, I wouldn't put it with the earlier books by Grisham, some of which I couldn't put down.  An interesting premise, but not a page turner for me.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I am so happy for buy this album! Christina is just the best! Real and meaningful music! Lotus is a masterpiece! Best of me my favorite!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a force of nature. Sometimes rough on mere humans, sometimes kind and supportive. His true talent was to give an experience to people before they knew they wanted it. The Mac, the iPhone...all the amazing tech products came from this man's intellect, heart, and aesthetic sensitivities. Isaacson told a masterful tale, one every person should read.
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte are truly unique in their singing the very beautiful ballads to the truly difficult opera arias. The sweet tones are mesmerizing and the thunderous opera is riveting. They can compete with the best. I hope to see more of them. For fine listening this is a must.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|The book is entertaining and stimulating, but not reliable. He may be corrrect about financial risks, but he takes on a number of subjects (i. e. French history) about which he is just plain ignorant.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|It was good but not as good as I had been told.<br />Very interesting and entertaining story. I would watch again
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I am a huge Sir.Archer fan, but this book wasn't up to his standards.  The first two parts of the Clifton Chronicles were amazing.  The third was really good, for the most part.<br /><br />===SPOILER===<br /><br />Are we supposed to believe Harry and Emma would let Seb visit Eaton Square and Martinez home on his own after everything happened?  Not even warn him?  I thought we were dealing with smart people until that point.<br /><br />The whole Argentinian saga seems frivolous, just so that another arch villain can be created that would involve Seb.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.  Not the usual Sir.Archer fare, I should admit.<br /><br />If you have read the first two books, you should read it anyway, for continuity.  I hope things get better with #4.
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|Kind of a trivial story.  Kept waiting for it to develop.  Boy learns to live with Tiger in boat?<br /><br />Not much to watch here I'm afraid.<br /><br />Jack Rickard
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|The story plods along - I am being generous when I give it 3 stars.  I expected it to be a lot better after reading all the glowing revues.
B00867GK26|5.0|No complaints here! Hands down great service, fast and chea. Also with a great guarantee. Great experience with this choice
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Controls are a little difficult to master with any precision and the level of difficulty does ratchet up very quickly.  Having a good deal of trouble getting out of the instruction mode into arcade mode, so I can imagine the level of difficulty in that mode must be fairly high.<br /><br />On the plus side, this soundtrack is an EXCELLENT  background - - one thing which I wish more developers would either take far greater care in choosing, or offer the option of turning it OFF so I can use a noise generator or radio app in the background instead.  This is one of the few game apps that I find myself cranking it up to top volume first thing.  I also like the two-finger tap to move to the next screen.  Six stars for the sound on this game'<br /><br />The graphics are also quite pretty and relaxing to the eye.  Five stars for the graphics.<br />Unfortunately, the loose controls that are hard to master, and quick difficulty increase translate into less than relaxation for me - why I docked it two stars.<br /><br />Despite that frustration, this is certainly one of the nicer game FAOTDs Amazon has offered in a while.  I tend to prefer utility apps or toddler distraction to doctors' office waiting room apps, so as a time-waster this one could be really good if the frustrations were ironed out.
B00004Z459|5.0|brand new out of the seal. no problem. I receive it the day it said its gonna get to me by.<br /><br />thanks
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My mother did not have this film and she loves british comedy so this was a great Christmas gift for her.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|I found this book very fascinating and enlightening.  Many good examples of how talent is grown and not the traditional &#34;nature and nurture&#34; argument.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I have loved this film since I saw it a few years ago, but I lost my copy and had to replace it. Thank you much for quickly shipping it out.
B00271HAK8|5.0|It has been fun to see my 11 and 8 year-old boys come to love this movie as much as I do. I didn't remember this much cussing in the movie when I was a kid but I guess that is my adult perspective now. My kids are now memorizing the lines like I did many years ago. In my top three movies of all time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The recharging cord for my Kindle was fraying and when I contacted Amazon regarding this problem, they promptly replaced the cord and shipped it to me without charge.  I have had my Kindle for eight years; that is truly great service!
B004L3L95C|2.0|I have liked all of the other Resident Evil movies. This one goes back to its video game roots and the sequences are computer modeled and generated. For example, the live characters are walking through underground sets and the red queen is generating or activating various zombies and monsters to thwart their escape from the underground facility. So, wait, what? Are the zombies and monsters real? How is the computer generating real live zombies? The movie didn't make a lot of sense and I found myself not excited by the action sequences because I knew the zombies or monsters weren't real. A very poor ending to this series.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Cute Movie, I really enjoyed it..not a kids movie AT ALL. I enjoyed the entire movie from start to finish.
B000HZHBIM|3.0|This of course was the comeback movie for Star Trek fans of which I include myself as one. However, this movie was a disappointment due to their being no real villain that you could identify with. This of course was corrected in Start Trek II The Wrath of Khan. Even so, as a fan you can't help but love seeing the crew and the USS Enterprise herself back in action.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|High quality production and great performances make this movie an awesome watch from start to finish. It's a damn shame this didn't do well in theatres.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|It is so much fun to play with this app. It was one of the first apps I downloaded on my kindle and i've had a ball with on a weekly basis since!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an amazing writer. Her work speaks for itself. If you like horror or murder mystery novels I highly recommend this or any of her other books. They are wonderful and dark.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show ever! I missed this season on AMC and I'm sooo grateful that Amazon had it available.  The best money I ever spent!
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|As I commented on previous two books in series, nothing surprising and while well written as always, a bit of a let down.<br />Also really hated the ending. Couldn't decide if leaving open for a further book or that's it. Either way didn't like it.<br />Don't think I would bother with any more books from Sir Archer.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Can't go wrong with Zoolander!! The \\"eulogy\\"  aka \\"yagoogalee\\" line gets me everytime!<br />(I spelled it how it sounds\\" lol
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't get enough of this game!  Love how it's fun and makes me think.  My kids love it too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!!  Couldn't put it down.  I almost read it in one day.  I hope she makes more like this!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This Album is awesome!!! When I listen to it I hear a soulful voice influenced by the sounds of Michael Jackson, Earth, Wind, & Fire...Journey, Sting etc.. If you LOVE music of the past, you will fall in love with Bruno and this album. Although some of the lyrics are a little explicit,(very few by the way... the song&#34;Gorilla&#34; to be exact) you can always skip it if you have little ears listening in on your tunes. My grand daughter loves his music too and I just do my voice over to muffle out the lyrics. No big deal. There's more profanity on prime time television!!! The flavor of his song writing is unique, fun and nostalgic and I became an instant fan after hearing his first album...well, actually I remember him doing his Michael Jackson routine as a kid and it blew me away even then...I can listen to Bruno all day!!!. His talent and artistic traits has made him a true entertainer!( Loved him on SNL too) Bruddah can act!!! ;-)..... many of us here in Hawaii are hardcore fans and very proud of him, his success and well deserved rise to stardom!!!!...You won't regret buying this!!! Enjoy!!! :-)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!!  Couldn't put it down.  I almost read it in one day.  I hope she makes more like this!
B002SSBD6W|4.0|Bought it for school, not by choice. Kind of creepy topics but educational I guess. I hope you will enjoy this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!!  Couldn't put it down.  I almost read it in one day.  I hope she makes more like this!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There was always something, that would someway be relatable in life. The acting was great and the story tasteful.  Can wait till season 3 is available for free viewing.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Slenderman.. what can I say about this game.. well, for starters, its a game without premise. What do I mean? Well, let me explain. The game dumps you in a middle of a road, field, etc. without even the slightest hint of what you are supposed to be doing, save for finding &quot;notes&quot; that are scattered about. As you wander aimlessly around in the bleak, monochromatic landscape, you occasionally will run into a long, slender &quot;man&quot;, who as long as you are in your line of view of him (or &quot;it&quot;), will cause your vision to start to be distorted, and he will close in on you. If he gets too close to you, the game will end as he turns into some kind of creature. Find all the notes before this happens, and you will win.<br /><br />The game uses the old Unreal engine (I say old, as the game engine is about 15 years old), so graphically, the game is pretty minimalistic. The only buildings you can enter are ones with large, gaping holes in them. The game is fairly linear, and sound effects are almost all environmental.<br /><br />The game does little to explain why or how you are there, what the &quot;slender man&quot; is, or what the notes even mean. The premise is a bit short sighted, and does nearly nothing to enhance this game. On the other hand, the game occasionally will offer some jump scares, and the presentation is unique enough for me to give it a 3 star rating. Thankfully, I picked this one up when it was free on the App of the Day.
0446573027|2.0|I read the Kindle version. Character development and plot are weak. Might be his worst book. It reads like it was written by a teenager....early teens at that. Just disappointed as I expected more. Guess I've just gotten used to the superior writing styles of Rankin, Silva, May, et al
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you don't have the time, don't start this game!  I play this game until my Kindle battery gives out!
B007V65R54|5.0|I liked this books lot - Nate (a new WEF YGL) has done the background work and tells a good story. Well worth a read to help better understand our world.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Watch out highly addictive game! We got this for our wii and the grandkids loved it, now I have it on my tablet and I can't get anything done!
B001EBYM8A|5.0|The acting of Harrison ford and Tommy Lee Jones could never be matched in this movie. A MUST see action movie!
B0091REZMW|1.0|Silly game! I tried but couldn't get into it. Maybe something for children, but watch out for the kids buying stuff with it. It is a trap for children to spend their parents money. Don't put this on your tablet unless you enable a pin for purchases.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I have enjoyed this game despite the fact that I have become stuck on one level. I keep coming back to it and making progress. It isn't as easy as you might think.
B004S3MB2U|3.0|Works pretty good, but it is a calculator. I don't use it for a lot, but what I do use works fine. What do you want? It's a calculator. has all the functions that the simple ones don't. It's just like my old HP that I use on my desk every day. Now if they could include concrete calcs and maybe feet and inches of fractional display, I could use it for work as well as play!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I heard a cover of Thrift Shop and thought the lyrics were catchy. When I finally heard the real thing I was really into the horns and though the band was probably a pop group that made a cool top 20 hit and nothing more. After seeing the reviews I decided to download this album and check it out. I was instantly hooked. The first song that just grabbed me was Neon Cathedral. A few of the lines caught my attention and I instantly found myself replaying. I then listened to Same Love and Wing$ and I took to social media to tell all of my uninitiated friends that if they didn't download this album immediately they would be unfriended (okay...that's sort of an exaggeration). But I did rave about this album, the quality of lyrics, the vocals, the instruments...basically everything.<br />It's feels like REAL hip-hop. All of the negative reviews I've seen further the point that this isn't the kind of ridiculous rap songs that have been flooding airwaves. This is what conscious rap sounds like. There are lyrics with a message, a great beat, catchy hooks and a little fun mixed in. I'm an instant fan of Macklemore!!
B00942X8PY|5.0|It's a great way to loose a few minutes, or even spend the time in a doctors waiting room, or restaurant waiting for your food to get there..
B00735HGQ6|4.0|I loved the characters, the story, everything about this book. I highly recommend this book. A wonderful book about healing a relationship and forming new relationships.
8186336141|3.0|Far too much for the average person.<br />Too much information and too long. A more brief tutorial on how to get started and so on would be more helpful for the person just trying to get started.
143353083X|4.0|It is a perfect Study Bible. I have carpal tunnel syndrome and it book is lightweight enough to hold with aggravating the condition. Print is a bit mallet than I'd like, but ok.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is an easy to use and inexpensive iPhone protector. I originally purchased the product to protect the phone while I searched for a designer cover, but I think this will be good for a while.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Very interesting and easy to relate to everyday expeirences. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the psychology behind personalities.
0451532082|5.0|My daughter needed this for school. It is priced very well and arrived very fast with Prime. I have not read it myself, but it is a very popular classic, so I assume it has some good points.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this story. I'd like to see it all from Peeta's point of view. I really recommend this book, you really fall for the characters.
B005URRCUY|5.0|There wasn't a song on the CD that I didn't like!  Great beat.  I can't wait for their next Cd to come out.
B00BEQZK5Y|5.0|Simply put I love it!<br />It's all there. Mr T... is there. Matias does'nt leaving any one standing starting @ his tones, to his rhythms, to his leads. Someone made the man mad and he's out for revenge! ;-)  Lets not forget Rolf...some drummers just keep time, Rolf is earning his pay!<br /><br />Yeah there are a few fillers, but all in all, this album kicks, and it kicks hard!<br /><br />In a day when I think its getting harder and harder to find good metal. This is a jewel. The songs are fresh, creative Metal.<br /><br />I say buy it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Bought this ebook as a gift for my grandson, an avid reader.  My grandson thoroughly enjoyed it and recommends it to all the 11-13 age group.
B005PK553C|5.0|This has to be the most creepiest, scariest program I have ever watched.  Ryan Murphy and his cohorts are really sick and warped....I LOVED IT!!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Very good! The actors are very good and make the characters of Holmes and Watson brand new for a new generation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was definitely a great book. Romantic, sexy, and a great story line all rolled into one. Can't wait to read the third one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to rate it this high because after a life time of reading few books, few can grab my interest like this.  I would call it a psychological drama and it may not be the best one out there, but, in the end since I could not put it down...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read the whole trilogy in 2 weeks. I wish there was more. I really do like Christian's story quite a bit
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a great book! I couldn't put it down. I love books with characters that have to come from less than perfect situations, notice the weaknesses in themselves, and grow from them.  These characters do not have the crazy 50 shades background, but they do have some issues.  Loved it! Wish there was a book 2!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|pizzzzzzzzza pizza yea! Pizza! I like pizza! piazza!  bxjhdjehcgd hdvuggegrvev.  ydhe. Pizza! everybody cheer for pizza! %$:%@:''%:&quot;&amp;?%:!'&quot;'?: B bxh. where's the pizza?
B00846REIS|5.0|If you've read all of the 50 Shades novels and don't know what to do then turn to the Crossfire Novels!!  Bared to You is awesome and I am very excited to read the next book!  It isn't nearly as devient however! More normal but still very sexual.  Certainly not for a young reader!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read this book for I am big fan of Nichols sparks. It's an inspiring love story. Although I wish it had more to the ending about Alex. When I got towards the last few chapters I didn't want to put it down.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|If you enjoyed The Hunger Games, you will love the Matched trilogy. Crossed is an awesome book that keeps you on your toes!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics &amp; a very fun game! I would definitely recommend this game if u like hidden object games. best one I've played in awhile.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After watching the movie The Hunger Games, I decided I should read the trilogy.  Well, it's WAY BETTER than the movie! I am so excited to see the next movie in November! The Mockingjay was a great ending, but I wish the books kept going!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Old graphics but good story lines for older show. If you like british TV and scifi, you will love this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my gosh!! I couldn't put this book down!!  I could not put Hopeless down. It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I kept forgetting that these people were supposed to be in highschool.
B00B52F278|5.0|My wife and I have watched it from the very first episode.  Totally sorry for the loss of the original Spartacus.  The New one is just as great. We enjoy it so much that we have purchased all of the existing videos of the series.  We will be sorry for it to end.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Even for those who consider any type of low-carb diet to extreme this book is worth a read. Some great eye opening info on how our body works and a change to stop and think about what we're doing to it.<br />I've been on Atkins for just over 2 weeks and have finished the induction phase 10 pounds lighter!<br />To be honest I was a little doubtful about it as I started. How could I possibly lose weight eating, of all things, the infamous butter? But I did. I lost the weight. And I didn't feel hungry, I didn't fill unfulfilled and had surprisingly few cravings so far.<br />It is by far the easiest diet to follow (even among other low-carb diets). I've tried the Dukan Diet and it did nothing for me. Even when I followed it to the letter. But with Atkins I saw the pounds dropping consistently this past weeks without feeling any kind of fatigue, headaches or any other negative side effects.<br />I do certainly recommend it. Give it a try. It my surprise you as it did me!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I was a bit concerned about all the negative publicity which spread before the movie even arrived in the theaters.  However, after seeing the movie I personally believe that most of the scenes and story line are as close as the powers that be will allow the American public to become aware of.  I loved it and will purchase the movie as soon as it becomes available.
B005LAII8K|4.0|A gift for a avid movie watcher.  He love it.  Received it quickly so it arrived in time for his birthday.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game.  I usually don't play games on my kindle, but this addicting!  And I love Jurassic Park! I recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its good, but when I downloaded it, I start to play it. When I'm done, I close it down. Then, later when I want to play it, it shows that loading screen. It starts to play the start menu music for temple run 2. But then it takes me back to my kindle menu screen without letting me play.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game makes you thing and plan in advance. The fact that yuo must use all of the space on the grid for the correct solution make it even more of a challenge.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this play/book/movie!  That's all I can really say because it's just so good.  Great story, excellent acting, and lots of spectical.
B0040I09RM|5.0|A great show about the inner workings of a bike club. Sons of Anarchy split there time dealing with the underbelly of life with gun running, drugs and murder! When they add in there personal lives things get even more interesting. From a Elvis impersonater to a new father who may want different things for his son. Love the show!!!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Happy up beat album, thought provoking lyrics. I can and have listened to it all day. Indie /electric/ hip-hop. Love!
B0063GORYU|1.0|I loved the game.  Ads recently have been continually popping up.  It' s too annoying to try to play a game.  I am dumping this one.
0066214122|4.0|i started reading crichton novels about 4 years ago. lost world was my 1st book i read and i really liked it then i read jurassic park. great too. good characters and interesting perspectives on scientific technology. there are some good things about this book, like the action and the description of the settings later on in the story. it really makes you feel isolated and claustrophobic. i think it's downfall lies with the slow beginning and annoying characters. it takes a while to get moving but when it does it's pretty exciting. there are 2 characters that i just hated reading because they are so stereotypical in a bad way. i'm sure you could pick them out right away once you come across them. all in all, i paid $3.85 for a hard back that is in great shape and it's good edition to my crichton collection. if you love inventive science (like in the jurassic park novels, or even micro) you'd probably dig this one. worth checking out.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I love this show, but am not happy with the way it has to pause to download via the Amzn Prime program. I'm going to buy it instead so I can watch without the hiccups.
B0085W09ME|4.0|Found this app very easy to use on the kindle.<br />it gives you a good range of dates to choose from<br />Together with times and prices.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|The Crue has always been one of my favorite bands. I read the book hoping for a glimpse inside their world. I ended up getting so much more. Get it.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|If you like GTA games you'll like this.<br />It is big and you'll need enough free space to play.<br />They did a great job bringing a game like this to the tablet platform.<br />The game controls have multiple setup options so you should be able to find one that is right for you.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Revamped!!!! Thought i wouldnt like it, but turned out pertty sweet. I would deff tell other people and watch it again.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I am a bit surprised these file search functions were not build into the android system.<br />You will  no doubt need this app at some point.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a very nice app.  It allows me to keep up with my friends on Facebook using my new tablet.  Super!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I didn't care too much for  this story. This story  should have been condensed into a \\"short  story\\".  The purpose for having 100 chapters with only 426 pages is ludicrous. Some chapters didn't even fill the page(s).  I hope the movie version is better.  I'm glad I didn't select this story for our book club.
B009D0KER2|5.0|Great app.  I love it.I read Le Monde when I am in France and this app allows me to do this when I am in the U.S.
B0061S073A|5.0|That's basically it. It locks the kids into a screen with only kids games. I wish I had this for the iPhone.
B001J32H6M|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is my least favorite movie in the entire Indiana Jones series.  It will always go down as a kind of bittersweet pill, a superbly visually and technically crafted movie, with a mediocre story, that can't quite decide whether it wants to be a horror film or a comedy.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark perfectly held the balance between comedy and horror, with brief \\"shock\\" moments followed by intense belly laughs.  In Temple, we are treated to gross-out moments at the dinner table followed by the darkness of the temple, where the movie, Indy and we the audience seem to go off the deep end.<br /><br />That said, John Williams' music to this movie is outstanding, some of the best he's ever written!  It is rich and textural, ethnic, with twangy East Indian chords adding flavor to the India locale and people, and some of the darkest male choral chants you've ever heard to symbolize the evil in the temple of the Thuggee cult.<br /><br />When Indy saves the day, you'll hear some fast, delightful music in the rollercoaster ride of the mine car chase, followed by \\"Water!\\" and various variations of high Thuggee priest Mola Ram's theme.<br /><br />Purchase this soundtrack as part of the 5-disc Indiana Jones set.  Disc 5 includes, along with great Laurent Bouzereau-directed interviews with key creative personnel, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and John Williams, on the development of the Indiana Jones music, many pieces from Temple that were previously unreleased.<br /><br />Buckle up and prepare for the ride of your life!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works great and is soooo simple to use.  When adding multiple things, multiplying etc, it shows you the work below the number so you can double check yourself.
B003KRJNBW|2.0|Shoot-em-up, shoot-em-up, blast and bomb-em-up, because the bible tells me so. Caters to the fringe of the right wing survivalists.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|It was exactly how I expected to get it in the mail. Very pleased with the service on top of a really good movie.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tarantino and he has truly outdone himself with this film! Christoph Waltz does an amazing job playing the charming and then terrifying SS officer. One of my favorite movies by far!
B008X8P8A8|5.0|ok so I have been waiting FOREVER for the total war series to come out for the Kindle. And it is finally HERE!! so differences is that it is a hex board not an open battlefield. but hey its a start. and at least they made this awesome game. great graphics for the kindle. but please Sega come out with another game preferrably anopen battlefield one thanks again deffinitly get this game.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I love every note that falls from Andrea's lips on this CD.  It is more than romantic...it is blissful.  I recommend this CD to all the lovers out there.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was very disappointed by the ending, and hated all of the characters, except for Go. I have never been so frustrated by a book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE this game. It is so much fun & never boring. It is a fast paced game &it is free! I am 52 years young & I play this game EVERY DAY!!!
B003YP7N9O|5.0|Solid remaster of a classic album (oops) disk. Plus a very well mixed 5.1 live concert. Great packaging and all around fine presentation.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I enjoyed reading about Sachi Parker's upbringing, I have to say that she definitely survived a very different kind of childhood and it is nice knowing what a wonderful mother and wife she turned out to be.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is, fun and addicting. I wish bonuses didn't cost money but oh well. I've never played Angry Birds before and now I am hooked!
B0094WK9EC|5.0|I love almost all the songs and can't stop listening to it. It is a great CD to workout to.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|From the moment I started this series, I could not stop watching it.  Wonderful storyline about the humanity of the servants and the upper class.  Historical and educational.  I am waiting to start the 3rd in the series. It shows like a good book reads.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I loved this book.  I enjoy Phillippa Gregory's books about English History.  A lot of real events told with a story.  Just after finishing this book they found the remains of King Richard.  Very interesting
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Very well written and cast story that is very well directed.  The story weaves carefully through making you almost feel like the main character and makes you think of what you would do if in the same predicament.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I loved it.  Have enjoyed reading all of the Bosch series.  Getting near to the end and anxiously awaiting the next new book.  Reading Mickey Haller now.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I never saw that ending coming. I thought I had the conclusion safely sorted out. I held my breath more than once during this gripping read.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not really my type of book.  Thought I would try it before seeing the movie.  Did not enjoy it at all.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great movies!! seen them like 10 times already!!! if you love batman, go for it now!! its a really cool box also.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love it!!!!! That's saying a lot from this elderly gamer.  Can't wait for sequel to come out. I thought the game graphics had a crisp resolution that was easy on my eyes and the screen shots were not too dark to see (which by-the-way is a big deal when your eyes don't see so well). The puzzles were entertaining and just difficult enough to be mentally stimulating without being debilitating. Keep up the good work.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Great bag<br /><br />I used for my nikon coolpix 510 and it fits great. I even put a small trippod inside the bag.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!!! I loved that is 2as  just so  REAL. I could feed the characters emotions really well.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This story is one that a lot of people will relate to.  How drinking can affect your life and everyone around you.  Denzel's last line ....even though I am here, I feel free for the first time......  I don't want to give away too much of the plot.  The main story was riveting throughout.  Hoping that things would go right for him.  I enjoyed the show.
B0086700CM|3.0|I've tried adjusting the sensitivity controls on this numerous times, but to no avail. No matter what I do, at certain points it doesn't properly register my movements and I go flying off into oblivion. Still fun for the younger kids who don't know better, but I'd hope for a better product from Imangi.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Even though this book is written for young adults it really has an amazing way of capturing how scared and destroyed a young girl can be by the simple acts of other human beings. It's awful how her life has turned and how she has managed to survive, and keeps you rivited to every word of her story.
8866137626|5.0|I love these notebooks, the ability to upload to EverNote is a plus, comes with 90 free activation code. I take this notebook to all meetings. The Moleskine Classic Rollerball Pen 07 Medium is a must include!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book....I always read before seeing a movie.  As usual, Nicholas Sparks can't be beat. You can count on Nicholas Sparks to never let you down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good game and it is very addictive but I think it is the best game around I think everyone should have it.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|My family loves this movie. It was not what I expected its funny and has action great for everyone to watch
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game to build with. It would be a good way to keep kids entertained with. The game could use more avatars though.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Awesome..I love the world the characters lived in. The collection was easy to navigate just in case you couldn't wait to see what happens.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|The movie was a great one to show to a group of mid level executives to discuss leadership and data analysis. I am coordinating a program with executives and we had a &#34;night at the movies&#34; and use this for our discussion.  The movie was entertaining as well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A wonderful story than takes you to a land of believable fantasy . One easily becomes invested in the characters and feels their joys and sorrows. Well written. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Overall I liked this movie but I didn't love it. It's well acted, well directed, well filmed, etc. But at the end I feel like there's needs to be a part II to finish the story.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Listening to Lincoln is like being in a time machine!  It draws you back to the scene of the infamous war and the hope this President brought.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|If youre a muse fan you need to buy this album. Just beautiful. It's just simply amazing.  love the whole thing
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Powerful is the absolutely right term to describe both the movie and the performance by Denzel Washington. Washington is so believable as a highly functioning alcoholic. A very compelling story with an ending I never saw coming!
B005PK56TA|3.0|Loved it until it started to sputter towards the end of the first series run. Women aren't shown as the most self-empowered people either. Then again anyone who does not split from this hunted house as soon as possible may be a bit lacking in the brains department.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Good date night movie, imho.  If you can spot them some grace for magic spells and a not-so-complimentary example of religious leader corruption, the rest of the movie -- including the good-over-evil ending -- was really good.  Humorous sidebars, no offensive sex scenes, moderately well done violence scenes, and decent acting, imho.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|I had not gone through more than a few puzzles when I encountered one that seems to be impossible to solve.  There are no directions that seem to tell you there are way to rotate the pieces or a &#34;give up&#34; that shows you the solution.  Being an engineer for 40 years I can't believe I can't solve one this low in complexity.  I think I'm being exceptionally nice giving it 3 stars.
B002RT5SR2|5.0|if you like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, you'll also like the Fountainhead....it was relevant when she wrote it; it's even more relevant today, imho.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Totally obsessed. Such a great story and acting. Very worth the $2.99 per episode to watch instantly in High Def.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I bought this app for my nephew and of course he'd show his old uncle how to play. He finished long before me. The game goes to the 4th level and stops...everything is locked. If I hit /tap next level it goes to my homescreen and its done. 4 quick levels for $3.00? Give me a break: its like a Jedi mind trick: \\"there's really a game, you'll really think you're past level 4, and ignore the droid and your home screen..\\" Fix the app or get rid of it. And the ads to buy more while you're in the app? Forget it. itsa great idea and as it says I'd like all the levels to play...
B001H1OUWU|5.0|I've had the pleasure of listening to this album before but as anybody should know the vinyl is where it's at. Amazing music that showed up at my doorstep well protected.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good product with lots of fun features.  It helps me keep in touch with friends that I do not otherwise see or hear from.
0439023521|5.0|Collins, Suzanne. The Hunger Games. New York: Scholastic, 2008. Print.<br /><br />  The Hunger Games is an addictive and worthwhile read in the way it confronts violence, humanity, and sexism through the adventure of a lifetime. The story begins as the reader is introduced to a young, female protagonist named Katniss Everdeen. She resides with her mother and sister, Primrose, in a dystopia called District 12, which is one district in Panem's society. Collins sets the story in Panem, a post apocalyptic North America ruled by the totalitarian Capitol, in which the twelve districts are subject to the rule and complete domination of the Capitol. Those individuals who live in the districts are forced to produce goods for the Capitol and rationed out little in return creating a very stratified economy. The society that Katniss lives in is heavily watched and guarded with electric fences, Peacekeepers, and other futuristic technologies used to manage the citizens of Panem. Because of a revolt that once occurred against this control, District 13 was done away with and the Hunger Games were instituted as a reminder of the Capitol's power and as a way to discourage any other rebellion.<br />  The Hunger Games are an annual fight-to-the-death competition in which each of the twelve districts must send two tributes: one male and one female between the ages twelve to eighteen. The tributes are chosen at random based on how many times their names are in the drawing which increases with age and based on how many rations they take out for their families. Though Katniss reassures her sister that she will not be chosen because her name is only in the drawing one time, Primrose is in fact chosen for as the female tribute for her district. Katniss selflessly and immediately takes her place and is joined by the male tribute Peeta Mellark.<br />  Prior to the reaping, Katniss would often venture outside of the fences, as her father had taught her, to hunt with her bow. Katniss is accompanied by Gale Hawthorne on her short, illegal hunting expeditions and together they experience a small taste of freedom as they pursue food to sustain their families. A love triangle unfolds over Katniss giving her the central power. Every move that the tributes make in the arena is recorded and played back for all of Panem to watch showing every gruesome death and violent action. Though the plot of The Hunger Games contains many violent scenes, they serve an important role.<br />  The violence in The Hunger Games is often very detailed. Because the setting is submerged in such disparity with forces that humanity today cannot relate to, there is distance from the terror of the gruesome atrocity of children murdering children. The violence is a statement of the pain that wars in the past have caused and also a warning against a path to more violence in the future. By having the setting in a future, post apocalyptic time period, it is inferable that it could be the path that is ahead if changes are not made. The Hunger Games are an absurdity for anyone to imagine, but it forces the reader to think of the contemporary world through a lens of antiviolence and examine the injustices that are going on today in the streets, schools, and behind closed doors. By recognizing its purpose for using violence, The Hunger Games becomes not only a desirable read, but a necessary one. It details the way that one person actually can make a difference and a life of oppression is not fixed.<br />  Collins does not allow for nonsense in her writing as transports the reader to another world. She creates characters with depth and writes Katniss as an example of strength. Katniss is not perfect with her sarcasm, stoicism, and hard-headedness, but her flaws are often only the result of her caring too much. It is important to keep in mind that she, as well as the rest of the citizens in the districts, is damaged by her society to her core and the oppression they face incredible. Her mother represents the way that many would like to behave after being so oppressed because it is easier to crawl back in a shell. Katniss, though, keeps going.<br />  The Hunger Games is a story of empowerment for both men and women because its gender neutrality allows everyone to find a way to connect to the story. Collins challenges the harsh barriers of sexism in past and contemporary cultures as she includes both males and females in the Hunger Games. With Katniss, she creates a new woman. One who exuberates the qualities both men and women respect and admire. Katniss is a hero and often this concept is lost because she also has to be a killer. Through her, the reader is forced out of his or her comfort zone into a situation that is surreal where right and wrong become blurred and it is up to the individual's inner conscience to decipher between them. Motives are tested and true character comes out in the choices the tributes make.<br />  The Hunger Games is an addictive read that is impossible to put down. The writing is intoxicating as Collins takes the reader down the journey of a lifetime. She does not direct the reader to fall for one character or chose one side, but she presents a story with a lesson about the value of life. If you are tired of the obvious allegories, this is the book for you. It has depth, but it is also enjoyable and quick. It gives perspective and looks at the greater picture. You may find it necessary to ignore the bandwagon and all the focus on \\"Team Gale\\" or \\"Team Peeta\\" because they delude from the heart and purpose of the novel. The Hunger Games is a story that will entertain, excite, enrage, and leave you starving for more. What more can you ask of a book?
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|The game is fun for children learning to spell.  I play with my granddaughter and it helps her spell words correctly.  I have not tried this with adults but I imagine it could be fun.
B003TH14H4|5.0|My favorite TV show.<br />Beautiful cast.<br />Great plots.<br />Exciting stories.<br />Nice twists.<br />Getting better with each season.<br />Sexual tension like the TV show &#34;Bones &#34; had in the beginning.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The Name of the Wind started the storytelling.  Now it is the wait for Day Three.  This is just a great, very detailed story.
B008X8RSTM|5.0|This app is very helpfull because you download the map that you need and without wifi or 3G, the satellite finds you and you can easily find your way or where you are located.  Excellent.  For me is a must to have it
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It is similar to the Fifty series, but after reading it awhile and into the next book, it finally became its own story.  I enjoyed the characters and their complex backgrounds.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|A bit remedial. And I'm not buying the love connection, or should say not happy about that part of it.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Ok reading - but there are too many repetitions or at least very similar experiences described. It does, however, give a good insight into something that few of us will ever experience (luckily)
0393342212|5.0|I strongly recommend this book!<br />Having two children of my own and also being a Therapist, reducing arguments in the house has been a challenge.<br />This book really gave me insight on how to handle sibling fights, how not to take sides, and how to get to develop their own problem solving skills.
B0014DW3OS|4.0|It is an action flick and Denzels characters is a bit over the top. Had not seen it in years. Like the subtle plot clues throughout.
B004R1Q296|5.0|I read &#34;A Distant Mirror&#34; by Barbara Tuchman years ago and was enthralled.  It still lingers in my mind as one of the most compelling reads ever.  So, I bought a Kindle version for my e-library.  It's amazing the wealth of information Ms. Tuchman found on a single Norman-French family.  It enabled her to provide a grounding element in her exploration of what it was like to live in the 14th Century that made you feel invested in the fate of the family.  And, yet, it is the odd little bits of information in the book that can make a lingering impact -- such as the small pot of indigo dye that was so precious that it was kept in the French King's treasury. I highly recommend this book.
B00BP4X3W2|2.0|I understand the historical importance behind the movie but seriously this movie is drag. watching people get shot for 3 hours is ridiculous, especially considering Schindler's story could've been explained from beginning to end in about an hour. I would recommend others don't even bother, spare yourself the excruciating boredom!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong games.  This version is different and at the same time it is great. I will play this version alot.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story line has been told a hundred times, a commoner who rises to be the hero but all the time the snobby nobles try to keep him down. Unfortunately the author doesn't come up with a way to make his version more interesting/intriguing. I lost interest in the main characters about half way through.
B007DIQAXI|4.0|When I saw the PINK vinyl color, I was sold. It is rare to find a good album that comes in a funky wax color. I had heard some of their songs and enjoyed it, so I thought why not give the album a try... I was not disappointed. It also comes with a free MP3 copy of the album for download which is also very convenient.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|Audio quality is good at the price range. One significant gripe: If you plug in headphones, you'll find that the big friendly knob suddenly become inconvenient for right handed people. Think about it... the headphone jack is right next to the big monitor knob, so how can your right hand come in from the right side? I'm right handed so I have to reach from over or under the headphone jack and cable (especially with the Sony 7506's longer plug). When you use a tool for hours, ergonomics make a difference for enjoyment of use. Regret not buying the Mackie Onyx Blackjack with better ergonomics.
B00005QG9I|1.0|This product is falsely advertised, it is not a vinyl. Please don't be mislead by the description on this listing.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A great novel of war, intrigue and entrails; A Clash of Kings has something to add to this already great series.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best Virtual Keyboard on the market right now. The competition is getting better but so is Swiftkey. Flow works well.... Tapping is accurate.... Word prediction is still heads and shoulders above any keyboard currently available.<br /><br />Worth the price!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter  loves this game. It is very easy for her to play. It keeps her busy for hours. I would recommend for any young girl to play.
B001UG56ES|5.0|The cinematography was phenomenal!  The little Aborigine boy was precious.  Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman had real chemistry on screen.
B0011Z5CV0|1.0|It was actually a lot larger than I expected but none-the-less decided to give it a try. First, I was disappointed because I expected it to do more...the problem with that was probably because some of the buttons didnt even work! Returned it...definitely not what I expected...and it was broke.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music just blasts me back into the heart wrenching movie.  I relive every moment of the wonderful film with the emotionally charged rendition of each and every song.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I always wondered why my remote did not work for the car.  Autozone wanted too much money for these batteries.  These are fresh batteries and a great price!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|I frankly do not like horror movies, especially movies like Texas Chainsaw 3D. They may cause laughter, but they make people insensitive to violence, and I do not like that.<br /><br />However, that said, the love a boy for a dog which leads him to dig up his dog and reanimate him with electricity, well, that can be forgiven. I loved the poodle with the bride's hairdo. Nice touch.<br /><br />Of the two best animation movies, ParaNorman and Frankenweenie top my list.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was quick paced and kept you trying to guess the next step.  Makes me want to read more by this author.
B000SVZIGC|4.0|Fun family movie for all ages! My 17, 16, 8 & 7 year old enjoyed watching this movie and my older 2 kids did research on the real Rasputin.
B008Q0D4MW|4.0|Although the movie was a bit slow and long, parts of it were very good, especially the battle scenes of 1700 European warfare and the duel between Barry and his stepson I found to be very realistic and dramatic.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Amazing game, I love it!  I have a lot of PC match three games.  This has totally absorbed me for two days.  You have a few different versions to play, so you never get bored.
0446547603|5.0|I buy all Nicholas Sparks books. His writings are so great and show so much emotion and depth. This is another must-have if you are a fan. I cannot wait for the movie! Great Job
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. If you like games that you play over time you will like this one. I have played many computer games but this is one of my favorites. I like the social aspect too. I like helping others with get the things they need and of course appreciate the help they give me. Great game.
0345803507|5.0|I was so hooked to this series, and was glad that the conclusion really fit it well.<br />I love that Ana and Christian are happy with each other and are starting their family. There was so much going on in this book other than the sex, lol. It was really great. I cannot wait to see what E L James writes next. I am definately a fan forever! :)
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|what little bit i played of the game if was okay but numerous apps on my kindle would not work properly after the game was loaded.  I got rid of the game quickly and all of my problems went away
0345803493|5.0|I love that this picked up where the other left off, and that Ana and Christian were able to reach an understanding of sorts. Alot of action in this book, in and out of the bedroom. Great addition to an amazing story!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have read the Hunger Games Trilogy. It's unusual for a movie to be as good as the book, but this one exceeded my expectations.<br />Her sensitivity and facial expressions were spot on. No wonder she won an Oscar.<br />Katniss and Peter make an unlikely couple while Liam Hemsworth is absolutely divine as Gale.<br />Cannot wait to see the next movie..
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|I was a bit bummed out there wasn't as much foreshadowing as there was in the book, and they left out a certain line about a bottle & some sunglasses! But other than that I was really impressed with Robert Pattinson's work and the movie as a whole.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is amazing and I love this book and I am a great reader and it's great to read the book it's a great way to read the book and I am in the end of this book and it's great to read more than I am unable to read.
1468161660|4.0|Don’t you just love that feeling you get when something really takes you by surprise. I mean, when you’re expecting something and you have all these scenarios run through your mind then when you finally find out what has been lurking beyond the next page, you’re completely and utterly surprised.<br /><br />Man. When Layken and Will got “slammed to the core” I felt it right along with them. My mind started racing; I wanted to find a way for them to get out of this situation. With every revelation Layken experienced, I found myself shocked. There are some deep seated emotions filling the pages of this book.<br /><br />Great characters. Exceptional story. Clever plot. Colleen Hoover should be commended for such an excellent work of fiction. She skillfully moves the story along using poetry and some, if not all, of the poems are powerful.<br /><br />I did have one teensy-tiny quibble: going by the educational system in Arkansas (the only one with which I have experience), turning eighteen in September means you’ve already graduated high-school, unless you’ve been held back a year. The cut off is the first week of October. This means when Layken moves to Michigan in September, she should be starting college, not her senior year of high school. I’m just saying… That’s the only reason I didn’t give this a five star rating. It gets 4.99 stars from me.<br /><br />Putting that tiny quibble aside, Slammed lives up to its title, poetically and emotionally. It even made me want to write poetry again. Something I hadn’t considered in several years. And, I’m thinking I might have to invest in some of The Avett Brothers’ music, if the lyrics that accompany each chapter are any indication, they’ll fit perfectly into some of my play lists.
0345803507|5.0|Have read all the books. Just about in the middle of this 3rd book of Shades Trilogy.<br />It is hard to put it down. What a couple!!! Very passionate!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I don't understand why this only has four stars? It's honest to the book (mostly) and more enjoyable than the other films. It deserves five stars... buy it now.
B00782O7IY|1.0|I'll be joining the few distinct users who weren't impressed by this movie. I had neither high nor low expectations for this film prior to my viewing, it was simply a curiosity to see how a modern film team would interpret an homage to the Silent Era and it really is quite eye-opening. I was hoping to at least have an enjoyable viewing, what I got was a painfully slow, predictable story with bland, washed-out filming. Although early B/W films of the Silent Era can be accused of blandness, the evolution of lighting was being explored well before the Sound Era to great effect, showcasing some amazing feats and effect in lighting. I suspect the effort and cost of teaching an entire crew how to properly light & dress a set for a B/W film was too great and it is apparent as this film really does suffer from some serious visual blandness, a la 1918 style rather than mid to late 20's. I suspect it may have been filmed in color, then toned out to B/W.<br /><br />Cue cards are almost non-existent, and while some films used a minimum of cue cards, this could definitely have used a sprinkling of a few more, especially for today's audience. We're treated to a full orchestra soundtrack that rips off other musical scores from other movies, unlike the audiences of the day who were more likely to experience someone playing an upright piano. The length of the movie is overly long for a silent B/W, but let's get to the actors.<br /><br />Most (or all) of the supporting cast is played by well-known American actors. I suspect it has to do with the overlaying point of the story (more on that later). The leads are played by two French (?) actors. The man has been likened to a mix of any number of charismatic stars from the time and the woman is described as \\"beautiful\\". Well, I hate to say it, but the guy has a big, wide smile that is fine in stills, but his overall demeanor lacks the poise & character strength so often shown by leading men of the day. Even when they are supposedly at their lowest in a film, they still manage to exude a quiet confidence and grace that you know will shine forth to save the day. This guy looks like your average loser who just keeps picking all the wrong choices and blames others for it. The woman is just plain unattractive in so many ways, but she is particularly unattractive for the time period being portrayed. I find it hard to believe they couldn't find anyone more suited to the roles.<br /><br />Aside from their looks, they simply don't act correctly, either for a silent film or for the period. They are over the top, and not in a good way. It's like watching someone impersonate another - in order to do so, they must accentuate any and all distinct characteristics. It comes off as superficial, even mocking at times. The most egregious flaw is the \\"dancing\\". People danced all the time, and it wasn't the flopping-like-a-monkey-in-the-zoo kind we do today. These were coming out of an era with some very strict and complicated dances, so people who danced, especially performers, had control of their bodies. Normal people were taught not to flop, or slouch (in fact the cloths really wouldn't permit this) and to carry themselves well (unless you were aiming to be a broom pusher all your life). When these two try to emulate dancing, it looks more like one of those kids toys where the jointed doll is banged up and down on a board. Even her \\"cute\\" jiggle looked embarrassingly ridiculous. These two were absolutely horrible, and you could see how difficult this was for the performers to accomplish any dance move, especially in the big dance scene. Just painful to watch.<br /><br />Onto the cloths, especially the actress's. I think it was her horribly ugly knees that first drew my attention to the costumes. The dresses were cut way too short. There were some beautiful and racy dresses of the day, especially on the film sets, but getting on a bus with your normal dress over 2\\" above the knee would have earned you, at least, thehairy eyeball, if not outright scorn. A \\"proper\\" woman aspiring to a career wouldn't leave the house like that. I'm not even sure a woman of the night would do that. Everything she wore just didn't look right for the era. It was small things like the cut or some accoutrement that just screamed \\"wrong\\". The male lead's suits were almost always cut too large. I don't know what they were trying to hide on him, but this often made him look unkempt or like a boy pretending to be a man. Maybe that was the point.<br /><br />People seem to think this is a simple, \\"cute\\" love story. I found the characters' story to simply be a vessel by which the entire purpose of the film was delivered in a ham-handed, insulting way. I understand this to primarily be a French endeavor. Given that it is silent, why not use French actors throughout? That was one of the advantages of silent films, the cue cards could be any language you wanted and many nations participated in creating films. This film isn't about the trials and tribulations of people during the transition from silent to sound films. It doesn't show how difficult it was for some people, after years perfecting and practicing certain performance techniques, to adjust to the changes required with sound. There is no exploration of the technology or the difficulties in adjusting the filming to accommodate the giant equipment. No, this film is about the false notion that Americans are uncouth racist nationalists who can't accept anyone who is \\"different\\" from them. At the very end, we \\"discover\\" our main character has a foreign accent (like we couldn't tell the way he flapped his lips during the entire movie that he was butchering the language) and THAT is the reason why the studios dropped him - he was deemed unacceptable to the public. Never mind all the born and raised Americans that were dropped because they couldn't adapt - this guy deserves our sympathy because he is an immigrant and we KNOW he was dropped because Americans have always been evil nationalists. They maintain that the actress is American by not allowing her to speak (she had work when he didn't) and everyone else speaks perfect American (they all made the transition too). He only becomes successful in America by hiding his immigrant status by becoming a dancer during the Sound Era and it took a courageous woman who financially fought the big, fat, corporate American film makers to do it. In a nation that continues to welcome legal immigrants from all over the world, in an era when there was great immigration, when just about everyone alive was either an immigrant or a direct descendent of an immigrant, when the \\"cultural\\" neighborhoods were blooming in the cities, we were just so downright nationalistic we just couldn't accept anyone with an accent. Unless they were British or Hungarian or something, but let's ignore that.<br /><br />For those of you who are wondering how this flop could garner so much acclaim and attention in Hollywood, remember this is a Social Justice film and that is why it is so important to laud acclaim onto it. It dares to show us what kind of jerks we were and are still today. The flaws don't matter, what does matter is that the general public, who probably has little to no experience with B/W films, believes this to be a masterpiece and a portrait of history, both of which it is definitely not. The reviews and general opinion of this film really is a testament to the power of suggestion and the desire to be part of a group viewed to be better, smarter, or more sophisticated that the general population. Such a shame, really.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written, interesting, and kept me guessing about how the book would end until the very last chapter. Have read all of Kate Morton's novels and every one of them is worth reading.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love it, always look forward to watching to see what Walter is up to next....and the dynamics of Agent Dunham and Peter!
1616202416|5.0|Religion. Oh Religion. In as much as religion has it's good side  it's down sides can be very damaging / ugly. It can easily deprive people the opportunity to think critically and lead them to look down upon their own selves as a people of a specific identity (denying their own selves).<br /><br />This book gives you the chance to see what religious Fanaticism can do to people. Highly recommend this book.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Very easy to use. After installing the software and getting an ambient light reading, takes about 5 minutes to run the routine and calibrate the monitor. Don't know why I did not get this earlier.
0374531269|5.0|Highly recommend this book to everyone. Makes you realize the seriousness of wars. Wagging wars is really not a joke. It shatters lives and I truly really hope all our political leaders especially those 'war drunk' will take time to read this book. They will definitely think twice before resorting to waging wars to resolve differences because this book is an intimate eye opener.

B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Es un libro del que aprendes mucho de los diferentes caracteres de los hombres.  Es increible que pese a la juventud de la escritora haya descrito tan fielmente cada caracter. Lo escogí porque es una obra clasica de la literatura Inglesa y porque antes adquirí con Amazon la pelicula y quería leer la novela.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I gave it five stars because it was highly entertaining.  The series is a glorified soap opera with really good acting.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good workout for the entire body in 30 minutes.  I sweat, struggle keeping up on a few things.  The nice thing is you can do your own intensity level and increase it as you build stamina overtime.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully written story about loss and healing. The language of flowers added a unique twist to the story line. Was sad when it ended and would definitely read it again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the different characters perspectives and how short the chapters were. It's great to get inside of the head of Auggie and to hear how normal he is. I have always been kind of scared of deformed people but after reading this I'm not. It also touches the romance, action, suspense, deep emotion that is really for everyone to enjoy. As a middle schooler myself I thought it was also very realistic and touching. F.Y.I. Listen to the song Wonder -- it goes along perfectly to this book!
B009CGGCSC|5.0|This movie makes me dance every time I watch it. It will cheer you up and put a smile on your face and before long your tapping your toes!

B000FC10QG|5.0|Even though the book starts off somewhat slow (due to the fact that they take some time to introduce all mayor players), the second part of the book is filled with excitement in every page. I guarantee you won't be able to put this one down until you find out how the biggest LBO of all time went down.

B004WGIXX4|2.0|Unless you want to break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend,,,whatever,,,don't assume this is a \\"date flick/chick flick\\"  It is just lame.  Poorly written, acted, etc, etc, etc.  Amazing what some actors/actresses will do for a pay check.
B004LROMX4|5.0|show what could happen after a invasion and the struggle of people fighting back to survive,starring noah wyle. i love this show
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This show is by far one of the best I have watched and always manages to pull people in if you give it a chance.
B0053O89KG|5.0|about and novelist who helps solve crime while getting insperation for the main character for his novels and finding out who the murders are
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Better than I expected.  Inclusion of Q-Bert and Tapper brought back great memories and nostalgia.  Turbo-tastic was definitely a kicker.
B00821OX98|5.0|It was suggested for viewing by my daughter and I really enjoy it, but find myself all clenched up and tense in the danger scenes.  It seems believable and I like all the cast members.  Noah Wiley is very different here from ER, but a good actor.  Hope to keep watching it on my Fire HD.<br /><br />Beverley McGraw
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Although this movie came out years after the first it was def. worth the wait. I love both actors Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph was a fun movie.  The nods to various video games were enjoyable to catch, even when they were fairly subtle.
0385349947|5.0|The publicity has been relentlessly negative,  but the book itself is interesting and funny and I'm winding up liking the author.  If you wanted to go negative, you'd describe the advice sequentially as  (1) go for it, just like a man; (2) but be aware of how men and women are perceived differently; (3) which sometimes means that you have to adjust your demeanor/actions accordingly;  and (4) oh heck,  here's how I walked the line and it seemed to work.<br /><br />On the other hand, she's making women aware of how they consciously and unconsciously do things differently, and telling them to consider those things in their professional life.  It's a messy world out there, and she's saying that there's no one correct way, but here's some advice on dealing with the mess. It's a smart and very readable book on a challenging topic. I'm a little irritated that people, particularly women, are jumping down her throat for being courageous enough to offer advice, even if it's controversial.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love this game. It is very good but the only thing is I can't update the game. Every time It asks me If I want to update it I say yes and when it comes up on the screen it says open instead of update.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie, as we've grown to watch the Minions as much as the other characters!  Let's have another movie.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|The description said this was good for kids up to 6, but my 5yo who loves playing veterinarian got bored right away.  The graphics are nice, but I think this should be re-categorized from education to kids because it didn't seem to teach anything despite being #1 in appstore for education when I bought it.  Also the belching garbage can is kinda annoying.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book as I do with most Nicholas Sparks novels. This one was a little different than his others in that it was more suspenceful which I enjoyed. My only major complaint was that the book ended very quickly - after so much build-up from the story, the ending felt like a little bit of a cop-out.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I was hesitant to sit down and watch this with my daughter, but it was a very entertaining film. The animation was spectacular as well.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I already had this on my Android and I like it very much. I found it to be just as good on the Kindle
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it never asks u ads it makes me calm down and it woo much fun hu have to play it
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The narrative is barely based on the real story, but the steamy love scenes make up for the inaccuraccies. Best of all is the beautiful set and costume design.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Although there are many great features I am very disappointed that I can only use the App if I am near wi-fi. I love all the functions I hate the fate I can't simply view the App unless I am online. Bomber!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004JK61K0|2.0|I dislike exchange, but I need to use it for work. I downloaded this app hoping that it would connect to my work exchange account, but it didn't.
B005HSL626|4.0|My granddaughter loves playing this game. She thinks it is fun and it keeps her entertained for a significant amount of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good FUN EXCITING game to play allot of the way to be a brilliant game player it's a fun good game better than temple run1 and 2 more adventure
B0071MQBX0|5.0|A fantastic production. It would have been a great loss not to record this one for posterity, and it translated beautifully onto film.
B00433SVP6|5.0|I've read all the Rick Riordan books now, and it's the best books Ive ever read. Huge fan of the Percy Jackson books!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I read the book when I was younger and I absolutely loved the movie! It has tons fantastic imagery. It's filled with tons of life lessons and makes for a great movie for family night.
B00AO3K05S|5.0|Anybody that wants to know about selling, in its current form, will have to read this book by Pink.<br />As you can now expect this author will surprise and delight you with good insight and a different take on a topic I thought I know a lot about. Bringing the practice and art of selling so close to home, even where I did not think I will find it, is one of the refreshing contributions of this book. The other reason to read the book is how Pink updates what selling is about and how to go about it in the current climate with the outcome of getting something from somebody.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Good docudrama, but when storytellers \\"exaggerate\\" it gets a little tedious. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this at the theater, but glad i saw it anyway.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Definitely boosts volume and clarity. That's what I wanted. Product is compact and easy to us. Look forward to enjoying it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for more episodes of this series. Wish there were more available now. The first three seasons have been awesome.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I recommend this season to all the Walkers and Biters out there.  Do not miss any part of the season.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Not bad but could be better. Sets you task that would take years to build up the coins to get there. And for the bit of land you get and the bits to earn extra you can't as it say it not in the bit you just used your coins for even though you can see clearly it in the bit you brought that needs to be sorted. As now it's t a taking days to get the coins up yet the task set are way out. So it's getting boating now. Time to remove of my kindle !!!
B009GXHOW4|4.0|Its a realy good game but the  Damage doesn't work please fix that so i can kill more mobs easier
B003G4W49C|5.0|The best book hands down. Absolutely phenomenal and a great book for all ages and all reading levels you can learn a lot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun and great for little kids! runs a little slow on the kindle but is still fun
B0086700CM|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. I play it all the time. My high score is 11,700,821. I love temple run.
B00AY5B9QA|5.0|I suppose it's a chick flick type movie, but I thought the cast was fun and I liked it.  It's a nice movie to watch if you're in a bad mood.  Loved Hugh Grant's role especially his dancing scene when he gets caught.  I like the idea of politicians who are more like the rest of us.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Very good book with a great story line, it keeps you guessing and made me not want to put the book down.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|These guys have turned the rap game out. Their lyrics are thought provoking and intelligent. I am forever impressed by these guys for writing about homosexuality in a positive way. You must check out Macklemore if you live for quality hip hop!
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Gross, bloody movie made in the likes of 1970s kung-fu movie, set against a backdrop of feudal China.<br /><br />I hastily went to see this movie at the cinema because I saw director Quentin Tarantino's name on the promotional poster. Turns out, he didn't direct this movie, musician Rza did. The cast of this movie probably saved it from being downgraded into a \\"rotten tomato\\". I'm giving this movie a pass grade because the storyline is somewhat funny.<br /><br />Take heed of the many 1/2-star reviews. If I had read them before going to the cinema, I could have saved over $8.50 (movie ticket) + $3.10 (medium-sized Pepsi).<br /><br />If you're looking for director Quentin Tarantino's famous master-pieces, try \\"Kill Bill\\" for a start:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007D5E7C2 Kill Bill: Volume One / Volume Two (Double Feature)]]
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|...then decide whether or not you like it.  I fell in love with it and it's the greatest thing I've ever watched on TV, ever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The first time I played Subway Surfers, I automatically fell in love. I know it sounds a little geeky to fall in love with a video game, but that's what happened! My opinion is that this game is way more addicting than Temple Run. This is a perfect game for all types of people. Whether you're 4 or 40, you will love it!
B004WESFZW|5.0|My thoughts are: have you ever thought about how lucky you are or why you are down on your luck? Watch this film and just maybe you will get your question answered, or not.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a really fun and interesting game. And while others claim it to be relaxing (and it certainly can be), it has it's moments where it can be a little frustrating. Ultimately though, it's a wonderful game with great graphics unique gameplay and a nice soundtrack to go along with it. I'm very picky with the types of games that I enjoy on my tablet (and phone) so to say that I actually dropped some cash for this proves that I definitely recommend this title.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It had differant smaller games through out. I don't think you could do this without the provided map. All in all this would be a game I recommend to my friends.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|it is still a good read.  The story moves slowly in the first half of the book because all the background information being provided.  This is typical of David Weber's other series that I've read in the past.  All the background info does pave the way for the rest of the story and subsequent stories though, which makes for a more interesting series.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Kind of funny seeing the &#34;new&#34; graphics, but it was at least tastefully done. Six more words required, so there
B001NHNG64|5.0|.  &#34;Die Trying&#34; struck me as a modern-day critique of the militia paranoia that swirls around any attempts at gun legislation.  I read the kindle edition and was pleased with the quality of the editing and would recommend  Lee Child to anyone who enjoys a fast paced yet well fleshed out tale.  I am currently rereading the entire series.  It is like seeing an old friend and reliving some old share memories.
B00871C09S|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection and Amazon had it for the right price.  If you love suspense and Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, this is a great movie to have!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I ordered a bunch of movies from my own and my boyfriend's childhood for a &#34;flashback day&#34;. Obviously the goonies is a great flick. It came quickly and in great condition, would use them again.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Excellent episodes... Measure of a man being one of the best. Continuation and refinement from season one. Makes me miss a current scify series
B001QC9PSO|5.0|It was in great condition and came quickly. As far as a review of the film....? Idk, it's TMNT2. I'm assuming you have seen it if you're ordering it. THEY'RE BABIES!!!
B005LJETYI|4.0|The plot needs a bit more explanation regarding the mechanics of the looping, but everything else is fun. Light, quick, and easy.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|I couldn't tell if they were trying to make a comedy or it was just horrible writing.  This was painful to sit through.  I hardly laughed.  Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast were terrible.  This movie should have never been made.
B001CTGQBK|4.0|Rented it for the grandkids  PIcutre quality was excellent in in regual SD.The grand kids l oved it.  The movie brought back a lot of memoies
B005PK56TA|5.0|CRAZY,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING BUT FUN SHOW!!! EVERY WEEK WAS A GOOD EPISODE NOW I WANT TO SEE SEASON 2
B005MMJ84K|3.0|This is where it all starts to tank for me. After the beautifully written first book, we suddenly switch from every other chapter being the present and every other chapter the past. A couple of pointless characters are introduced whose stories never go anywhere and Lena is betrayed by her own people.
B00123IATW|5.0|we just don't have bands any more who are artists at playing their instruments. Wonderful instruments with lyrics that make very little sense.
0061726834|5.0|This was an awesome example of dystopian literature.  Everything looks clean and contained, but is anything but in this romantic tale of forbidden love in an almost communist society. It has it all! Surprise, intrigue, and a little romance on the side.  All-in-all, a really great read!  It isn't until the third book that the story truly tanks.
B002R2B6NE|4.0|I've seen this 4-5 times and I never get tired of it.  Great acting (mostly) and good plot.  Would see again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Terrific initial scene for Season 2 Episode 1.  Getting to know the characters was fun and now seeing the interaction between them is wonderful.
B009EDZGY4|5.0|My son loves this movie! He has asked to watch it every day, he's a big fan of dinosaurs. one
B009EBLCK8|5.0|The characters are lovable, the stories are quite interesting, and there's still enough of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to appreciate (without the poor production value of previous attempts by the BBC).
1616550414|5.0|Very different and cool I am usually not a fan of these types of books but I love the Zelda series and had to give it a shot and was not disappointed! A lot of really cool pictures and information. A must have if your a Zelda fan!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend for having such crazy twists and turns. The first chapter was a little dry and I found myself wondering if it was worth continuing to read. Once I got into the second chapter I was very happy I stuck with it. Btw, the book only has 3 chapters, that came as a surprise after I had read several almost a third of the book and it finally said Chapter 2. I'm a huge Grisham fan but I found myself enjoying this as much as the majority of his books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so awesome since it is less costing than pc edition. Since I don't have the money to buy the personal computer version.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|A good movie-lots to hold the interest of adults and kids alike. The animation was top rate.  I think it had a very positive message for girls to be true to themselves but also had the moral of be careful what you wish for.
B009VA1FN6|2.0|Too many Gosh and Golly words for me. It was like Enid Blyton for grown ups. I read about half of it before I gave up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved the story.  Ready to find out what happens next!  What more could you ask from entertainment!?  We live in a world that is turning old abandoned silos into houses. How fun to imagine one big enough to hold an entire town!  Like a vertical aircraft carrier!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This story ambles along - much like his walk. Not exciting but comfortable meaning of life stuff. There were some really good quotes that you could apply to your own life.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Like the special edition series and waiting for the last set to come out in that.<br />Products were delivered timely and in great condition
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I have always enjoyed this book.  The kindle version makes it that much more portable.  I have always wanted to get this book on my ipad
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Wasn't as impressed with this one.  Definitely did not live up to the hype of the other ones in the series.
0758232225|5.0|Again I would recconmend this book to church members., You had to see something in this book thas you have went through doing this Christain walk
B00498YZFK|4.0|I was really surprised at how good this movie was.  Jennifer Lawrence was great in this.  All the other actors did a really good job as well
1452101248|5.0|I have added Plenty  to my copy of Jerusalem and am totally enthralled with both books.  Such a new take on cooking, so exciting and vibrant, not to forget healthy and fresh.  The recipes take you on a culinary adventure to new cuisines and ingredients, no pretentions here, just wonderful dishes to share, and get us back to the times when meals were a sign of welcome and hospitality bringing the family, friends and neighbours together for conversation and long, long meals.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had read this book before the movie came out and even after seeing the movie, the book is so much better and more detailed. He wraps you right up into the story and gives you chills!
B00005YUNY|5.0|Of all my concert videos, this is my favorite. I also bought the Live at Montreux because I wanted one with Rick Wakeman in the lineup. I didn't like that one as well. Symphonic would have been a died and gone to Heaven video if Rick had been there, but in life, I guess we can't have everything. To clarify, the keyboardist does well, but you just can't replace Mr. Wakeman for that true Yes feel to the music. Don't let that stop you from buying this one, you won't be disappointed.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Its another chapter in the Resident Evil franchise. It seems as though they are running out of ideas. Unless your a huge fan, I wouldn't bother wasting your time. For the hardcore ResEvil fans out there, its got plenty of the anticipated gore you would come to expect. There are however no real surprises in store.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is written in such a way that I believe everyone can relate and connect to it in their own way. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|a fantastic experience. I highly reccomend. its awesome. it was free and that was cool too. why does my review have to be this long? I just wanted to rate it and let you know how awesome it is.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|HD quality of stream is great. Doesn't beat Blu-Rays, but it's very close.  Convenience is much higher than waiting for it in the mail.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Ranger's &#34;I can make you forget about Morelli&#34; speech. Classic...  I wonder what's gonna happen next. Ranger or Morelli what a dilemma
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Great movie! Great performances and excellent message. Worth buying. Need to have an open mind when you watch this. It made me cry but felt great after watching it
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is one of the best Rovio games I have ever played with the new update there us a lot more to do. One of my favorite things to do in the game is the gravity circles because it will launch the bird and make it curve. Also I like the new birds powers to go to where you touch with your finger.
B005F82X48|5.0|Icon for Hire has almost immediately become one of the favorite bands currently playing today.  Their indy sound is something that is rarely found amongst today's pop-soaked, fake musical culture.  They have a great rock sound, with fantastic vocals and writing.  One of the few albums that i can listen all the way through and never have to skip a song.  One of my favorite albums and one more than worth the money spent.  It's about time that someone continues the actual trend of rock n' roll, without letting pop music pollute the sound.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Great show... This season was one of the years with Dr Pulaski . In the late 80's early 90's this was appointment tv!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|The FX were great, the story line not too cheezy, and I really enjoyed the movie. I'd watch it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Bought this because of ratings......big mistake.......the name says it all!!!!! Had the whole plot worked out about half way through, kept waiting for a twist, sadly nothing changed.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I love all of the songs on this album. They all seem to have some sort of meaning.  Great buy!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|It was kinda fun to play--alot of ads and you played a few (very few) levels and than you had to buy it. I un installed it from the kindle not worth $1.99
B009CCBCU4|3.0|This ended too soon for my taste.  I understand the author wants the readers to purchase the rest of the series, but this book was just too predictable.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I was not happy with this game for the simple fact that after playing once and clearing two of the rooms it would would not let me progress any further.
B0086213XW|3.0|Acting was good and I love everyone that is in the movie but I felt a little sad after watching it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is seriously one of the most addicting games ever. I started with the basic &#34;Cut the Rope&#34; and was so happy to see that there was another game available to play.
0143118420|5.0|Even if you don't get to travel like the character in the book, Elizabeth Gilbert offers a new perspective on moving from the stuck places we find ourselves in in life.  What a grand adventure this must have been!  Well worth the read.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|You are a blob that jets around and absorbs other blobs... it's easy at first, but gets harder.  Factors like the amount of food, space, and even gravitational pull affect the play. The music is nice, the game play is engaging, and I really like playing this game.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|I enjoy the spectrum of styles Sting explores in the music he presents.  When it comes to Christmas/Holiday/Solstice, I am always searching for something new, this album didn't disappoint.  I listen to it year round.  Love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really fun but one thing you should add to the PE version you should be able to interact with treasure chests etc. in creative mode and be able to change the gamemode on and off but its really fun so far!
0307887448|3.0|Pros: The online social aspects of this story are the best you can hope for. This is not a fake story of online life based on uninformed theories about online communities, attitudes, relationships, and culture. Instead we get the real people, how they conceive of themselves in virtual existence, and how many of these relationships heroically and tragically play out. Each of the players/characters is detailed with a rich and enthralling story of their own. For this reason, and because of the book's astonishingly grim vision of the future of consumer culture, this book kept me reading until the resolution.<br /><br />Cons: On the other hand, the larger plot is supposed to be about an easter egg hidden in a game like second life that somehow came to dominate world culture, which I found to be a real stretch. This leads our heros on a quest for outragious fortune left by the dungeon master, and most of the action you would enjoy in a D&D module or adventure game is left out. A more tired plot is difficult to find, and all the 80s referencing seemed good at first, then got redundant and annoying about 1/3 through. The wish fullfilment left very little wonder about; once the formula is established, like in an arcade game, you just keep playing through the same level with different rock stars, sit-coms, movies, and video games as the trivial details.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is good fan fiction because it has characters and subplots very worthy of a good story. However, it is not an homage to a particular designer or style, rather a cross-section of the 80s that might make some people feel nostalgiac for their Spielberg and Atari glory days. I was a youngster during the 1980s, read comic books, played games on primitive computers, excelled in school, enjoyed a lot of RPGs, and even watched Anime, so I caught nearly every reference and nuance. As I said before, this seemed awesome at first, but I got tired of it early.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing LIncoln, I really wanted to read the book.  It transformed my view of Abraham Lincoln.  Instead of a man who was mistreated, underestimated, and lucky to be President; I learned about one of the greatest men who ever lived.  He was the gift of providence at our nations most critical hour.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A story, well weaved with necessary facts and examples.  A compelling narrative, supported by expert input, that explains our need to retrain our run from the last half a century.<br />I highly recommended reading this before you get another running related injury!
030758836X|2.0|There were so many twists and turns and I was really enjoying the read. When I was nearing the end I didn't want to put the book down. When I got to the end I thought I missed a few pages. Very disappointing ending.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am downloading it right now I'v played it on my friends iphone and IT IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.Thats why I recommend it AND IM 9
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Disney did a great job coming up with a story that delivered on content and fun.  Good family friendly movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If there is a norm in Fringe this season starts moving away from it. Moving back and forth between universes and people is sometimes hard to keep up with but it adds to the strangeness of the whole thing. I'm really liking Astrid more and more, she puts up with Walter very well and helps out on every investigation. Of course the main 3 are excellent. But is their still 3? Stayed tuned to season 4.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Okay the guy who said that this game should be &quot;chiller&quot; Hahahahahahaha that's hilarious. I hope that was a joke. Anyways..... Yeah this game is freaking amazing.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I trust this source of world news more than some American sources.  Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great fun . Earn points and trophy. Runs great no problems on my kindle fire. Can also connect to Facebook account to add to your friends list. Free tournament daily play.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|The television show was amusing, playful and had good basic moral display of idealistic family values and qualities.  Happy to see Shannen Doherty leave to her calling of making online and bogus college commercials.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS APP IS SO LIKE THE REAL THING ,you should tots get it .it even has baby animals like PIG baby's it's amazing.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|The movie was definitely a fun movie with a slight twist of goofy and play.  The characters were welled played by the actors.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is, without a doubt, one of the best and most disturbing films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It was written, produced, and directed by the great David Lynch, and was his directorial debut, released in 1977. Due to a low budget it was filmed in black and white but I think that it improves the film's overall quality and makes the film look more eerie and unsettling. I actually think it wouldn't had been as good had it been shot in color. The basic plot follows a mild-mannered man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) who has a wild frizzy hairstyle that makes his head look sort of like an Eraser, hence the title. He lives in an industrial wasteland in a small apartment filled with odd plants and other objects. One day, when returning home, the beautiful girl across the hall (Judith Anna Roberts), tells him that his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) has invited him over for dinner. When he goes over for dinner, which itself is an extremely awkward and odd scene, he finds out from Mary's mother that she recently had a baby, although she says it's premature she doesn't tell him that it doesn't even look human. Looking more like a cow fetus, after they bring it home it cries incessantly, and this is where the film truly delves into a surreal nightmare of vivid dreams or hallucinations where the line between fantasy and reality gets thinner and thinner as the film progresses. Eraserhead is a true cinematic gem and one of the most original films I've ever seen. I've never seen another film quite like it, although a few, such as Tetsuo: the Iron man and Begotten come close. Not even David Lynch has made another film like it, although Inland Empire comes close, in reality it's a more mainstream film, at least as far as dialogue and characters go. Overall Eraserhead is a great surrealist film that would make directors such as Luis Bunuel and Alejandro Jodorowsky envious and I can definitely see why Stanley Kubrick enjoyed it so much, and the influence it had on his film, The Shining. As far as interpretations on this film go, it definitely varies. I've seen this film interpreted from everything from a dark comedy satirizing marriage and parenthood, to a psychological horror focusing on a man going insane, to a surreal nightmare, to a film focusing on the negative effects of industrial pollution, focusing on mental and physical illness and deformity . Personally, I see this film as a surreal dystopian film which focuses on a friendly, likable, sympathetic protagonist (Henry Spencer) who is trapped in a hellish industrial wasteland which he views as a literal hell, and many of the dreams and hallucinations scattered throughout the film are his way of coping with his bleak reality. In the beginning of the film Henry is miserable and lonely, he seems unable to smile or find any real happiness, but in his own way he seems joyful when he learns that his girlfriend Mary has invited him over for dinner, it is here when we get a clearer glimpse of just how bad things are for him and the other people who live in his world, all of Mary's family is just as mentally ill and disturbed and he is, although in their own way, and you often have trouble distinguishing what real and what's not. Things get even worse when Henry learns he has a baby with Mary, and just like everyone else in Henry's world, it is deformed to the point of not looking human. It cries incessantly, and both him and Mary seem truly unhappy and miserable together, after she leaves and Henry's reality is left even more bleak and miserable, he begins to hallucinate even more, imagining a joyful, oddly beautiful, innocent looking woman who represents or symbolizes heaven, he is eager to go to heaven, meaning he is actually suicidal, reaching out to touch her, but as he does, he sees the grotesque man in the planet, symbolizing hell or the devil, which could possibly be a religious reference, since it's a common Christian belief that people who commit suicide go to hell. In the end, regardless of how you interpret the film, it remains a thoroughly original, thought-provoking film of the type that is sadly lacking in much of today's cinema, obviously Hollywood but even among independent and art-house films. David Lynch created a true masterpiece with Eraserhead, and it's the first film I've seen of his and the reason why he's my favorite director. A well-deserved 5 stars..

B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Great songs and high quality recordings.  Some of his best songs are on this album.  The live performance CD which is included is wonderful to listen to.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this dragon game and it is a great way to just have a small amount of me time away from the kids.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|I've been re-watching the Shield and am enjoying it just as much as I did when it was on the air.  One of the best shows that's ever been on television and it really stands the test of time.  You find yourself rooting for characters who are really terrible people, but their humanity and good qualities are shared in a way that makes them people you can relate to.  Watch it!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love sci fi when it's well done, and in my humble opinion, this is very well done. It's hard to get my work done between episodes, and I am very much looking forward to the rest of the seasons!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good but no Mitch rapp--definitely worth reading as it does a good job of filling the void while waiting for Vince Flynn or brad thors next book
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I watched this after a recommendation from my theology professor.  It was incredibly moving and gets down to the core of human guilt and sin.
B00B6SI7TG|5.0|I loved this song.  Had an 80's feel for me. Can;t believe they have been around for three decades now.
0452289963|5.0|Great work by a beautiful man. I read it many times and will read it again. What would Eckhart do?
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I've been reading all the rocker books, starting with Keith Richards (the best one yet), Steven Tyler, Neil Young, and now Townshend. What they all share (outside of Keith) is a complete and obvious lack of editorial oversight. Never would these books have been allowed through normal publishing standards, where an editor makes shaping suggestions, cuts, etc. You can't read these &#34;books&#34; as books but as long blogs. Tyler's book, for instance, appears to have been spoken into a tape recorder and printed verbatim. Neil Young burdened the reader with two opening chapters about his garage train sets (the opener! and later with laborious descriptions of his antique car collection). It takes a lot of patience to read these things. But despite themselves, if you can get through it, you get a sense of the person. If it's not literature, it at least gives you that.<br />  And now Pete ( an ex editor himself). Inluenced by the spirituality of Baba O'Reilly, drags down the narrative with interpretations of Tommy, Quadrophenia, with interminable story plotlines nobody who loved the music knew or needed to know.<br />  The sweet surprise: He was a born geek, stayed (mostly) true to his wife on the road, cared about his family & friends. He, unlike our other icons, appeared to be insecure about his sexual prowess -- a welcome revelation!<br />  Too many pages are devoted to his infamous arrest on visiting a child porn website for &#34;research.&#34; Townshend is one of those people who suspect they were violated as children but have no memory of it. The space given this chapter of his life seems like overkill and raises more questions than answers.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I liked this book pretty well but I wouldn't say it was my favorite. The plot is interesting, but is a book for more advanced readers.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|\\"Salmon Fishing In The Yemen\\" is the kind of absurdist comedy that the British do so well informed by American style romance movies.  I have virtually no interest in salmon fishing and even less for rom-coms.  The fact that the film kept me engaged means it's a smashing success.  The romantic chemistry between Ewen McGregor as a stuffy fish and game official and Emily Blunt as a perky attache to the sheikh of Yemen is palpable.  Kristen Scott-Thomas chews the scenery with aplomb as an aide to the Prime Minister.  The film is virtually stolen by Amr Waked as the Sheikh of Yemen whose dream of bringing salmon fishing to his arid homeland isn't so much a personal pecadilloe but symbolic way to unify people of all backgrounds.  Not classic stuff but a great thinking man's non-think diversion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put this one down, Love these , &#34;wish it were me&#34; books, LOL. Who wouldn't?  Love, Money, Hot Guy and he only wants me and buys me a ton of cool stuff.
1592533868|5.0|I love the detailed instructions and all the different ideas, it is a great book for any paper crafter in my eyes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book, Great dream, wish this for anybody. Had a hard time getting up in the mornings, fun, fun, fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Great book and characters.  I couldn't put it down, I read it in 2 days!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This is about families but it is not for families to watch together unless you are ready to explain how and why birds and bees sodomize each other.  The story is excellent and action packed with lots of unexpected plot twists and turns.  The only problem is the seasons are way too short.  You never want it to end.  Great epic sets and scenery.  Must see tv
0060763280|1.0|I read this book based on the positive reviews.  Unfortunately I found that this book contains a lot of fluff, with very little substance.  Also, it seems that the author is trying to do everything to get you into his seminars.  He does offer some methods for positive thinking, and interesting stories, but would lack any direct relevance.  Overall, a rather disappointing read.  I would recommend the Millionaire next door (very eye-opening).  Also another very informative book I'd recommend would be \\"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns\\"
1595827684|5.0|Mass Effect is a rich universe with a plethora of visuals we only get to see with a passing glance; from the details of the Normandy, to the minute details that went into creating the armor and weapons, this book gives you a better look at at how starships were designed, or the possible paths certain characters appearance could have taken.<br /><br />If concept art interests you, then this is a book to have.  If like me you bought collectors editions of the games just for the art book, then you need this to complete the art collection.
B00B2DSIAI|3.0|I really wanted to love Wreck It Ralph. The idea for the story sounded great, the animation was great too. The first half of the movie flowed along well, great character development, but then when he gets over to the Sugar Rush game the momentum of the film grinds down.<br />When it was all said and done I did enjoy the movie, but when the story shifts from being about Ralph to being about Vanellope it took what seemed like a personal growth journey for Ralph and shifted it to being just another animated adventure mixed with MarioKart.<br />If you like the retro games, remember playing Qbert and Beer Tapper, if you love you some beautiful CG, than you should check this out. Wreck It Ralph has good heart, it has a great voice cast, and very subtle humor. I looked forward to watching and wasn't disappointed, but the movie wasn't all that it could have been. Maybe I had too high of hopes being a life long gamer starting in the days of 8-bits and terrible E.T. games so this movie was speaking my language, and I think that may have been my problem, was that it started out as a homage to old video games in a modern world and at some point veered into a standard animated movie. The add in of the old classic video game characters was great, and I loved all the humor and one liners. I just wish the movie stayed on its original line as a goofy classic video game movie about Ralph. I'd never say not to check this movie out but don't expect anything other than nostalgia.
1781164266|5.0|For any enthusiast of the game, this is a must.  Contains most conceptual art for all three games.  If you enjoy the series/universe, then this is a welcome addition.
B0015DRPJU|4.0|This book is a great read. It leaves you hanging. Cause you think you got it. Something happens that changes everything.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a great pass time for everyone if used wisely, the games the people, family and friends you can stay in touch with if not near you is wonderful to have.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is an awesome series! My wife is also now hooked, too bad its no longer being aired? I have enjoyed every episode
B0037QM8YA|4.0|I am a teacher and I would like to say that this film talk about similar situations in others schools with several students, more than we can imagine. The product and the service that Amazon provide me were good and I am pleased. Thank you.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great action and character development.  Stories have twists and unexpected threads. Smart sci-fi. And love the floating graphics. And it gets even better in the later seasons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although I wasn't always pleased with where the story went, I always came back for more. The acting is excellent and the period in history is fascinating. It's not exactly a documentary, or a soap opera, or a drama, but it's a little of all of those in the best way.<br /><br />You will enjoy, but you must start with season 1 and work your way forward.
B0050OMJIW|4.0|I have been meaning to read this book for so long and I finally got around to it. I wasn't disappointed! Though definitely on the weird side, the writing style did not put me off at all - I really enjoyed its quirkiness. At its heart, this book is incredibly meaningful and incisive, but it's also fun and crazy too.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|The only issue I have, is that I do not see Season 2 on my Xbox.... We (not couch potatoes) gobbled up the 1st season in about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Great show!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|amazingly excellent. almost accurate a nessesity. cant do with out.  really cool looking. really fun to just stare and sit and watch. very very very amusing
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|big fan of the TV series, becoming a big fan of the books.  Enjoy how they tie them in together.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You can do whatever you want to with your dragons.<br /> it is really fun hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B002PEP4SC|5.0|worth your time to read just for the enjoyment of an escapist time. great series, want to see more soon
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|overall a very good bond movie. bardan does a great job as the villan. g o o d flic k
B0030GJ50C|1.0|THIS MOVIE SUCKS<br />RED BOX MACHINE KEEP SPIT IT BACK OUT DO NOT RENT WASTE OF MONEY SO SO SO BAD
B00969PR18|3.0|Didnt love it. Decided to keep using the smart phone with the terrible reception than try to use this app on the kindle at home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 15yo daughter told me: \\"Mom, you need to try this game...it's really good!\\".  I did & now I'm totally addicted.
0547848412|5.0|Beautifully written story of courage after despair, strength of mind and heart bringing strength of body, a protagonist not just to remember but unable to leave behind.  I've read it three times already, and plan to read it again.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best Bond yet with Daniel Craig. He is my second favorite Bond after Sean Connery but if they keep making them like this he'll be at the top of the list.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My son enjoyed watching this movie. It was a nice movie for a family day.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for kids 4 and up.
B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|Where is \\"Something Stronger than Me\\", \\"Casino\\", \\"I Will Fall\\", and the best of the others???  I will not buy this fragmented disc.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really love this movie. My family and I laughed a lot. It kept us entertained. Really recommend this movie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like it because I can see at a glance how much battery life I have left, rather than having to go back in to the device and see.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book quite a bit. Ms. McKenna's descriptions--particularly in the first half of the book--are funny, spot-on, and beautifully written. Captivating characters, a welcome plot, a harrowing and interesting look at Magdalene homes.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|If you love Josh Groban you will love this, especially &#34;brave&#34; which is my favorite, but all others equally good. Enjoy!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Loved everything about this book! Can't wait for the rest of the series to be completed as I'm dying to read them
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a good game in all but l don t know how to play multiplayer<br /><br />p.s creepers creepy me out
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love this show!!  It's the best! I don't know how amazon feels like they can make you write a review of certain amount of words or it can't be submitted.  I've said what I wanted to say.  I  didn't purchase anything but again I  loved it! G whiz!!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I came for Thrift Shop, but found many of the songs to be awesome.  Powerful messages and excellent beats make for an incredible album. Will definitely be checking out more albums from Macklemore in the future!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it as much as the first!! Cant wait for the third! Extremely addictive series. Always sad when I finish reading books I love!
B007MU85D0|4.0|Definitely an album where you start out liking one song (Little Talks), but slowly develop an appreciation for the whole track list.  If you find the previews catchy then this is a great album that will be a great value in your library!
B00406O7YK|5.0|I loved this movie. Picture was very clear. Sound went out once and I had to restart the movie to get it back. I love watching old movies on my kindle.
B00A0R0CG0|3.0|Without over analyzing, I thought this one was the most intense of the Ice Age movies. Parents might want to do a preview before letting the kids check it out.<br /><br />Also, Crash and Eddie were mostly ignored, which made this Dad sad!<br /><br />Not a bad movie by any stretch and I realize that it's trying to evolve, but I missed the simpler storylines and smaller casts from the earlier Ice Age movies.<br /><br />My son still enjoys it, but there are a few scenes where he doesn't want to watch the monkey.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is an awesome book! It's kinda sad because important people die but it's romantic and the end of the book is happy!
B008476HBM|5.0|No explanation necessary, but this book gets even better each time I read it.  I love Jane Austen!  A must.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun and very easy to update. It doesn't post on Facebook without permission.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I am a 40 something mother/wife and when I saw this app for free on my Kindle I asked my teenagers if they ever heard of Slender Man, well they both got excited and told me I had to download the app because it was such a good premise.  My son even gave me the history lesson on how the Slender Man came about.  Well I downloaded the app later that night and as I am sitting alone decided to give it a try, bad idea - had to turn off my kindle because I was so afraid!  Later my son came up and I asked him to play with me so he did and as I watched him go through the game I was on the edge of my seat, it is exciting and very scary!  I don't think that I can play alone at night - maybe in the day time.<br /><br />The app itself is really very well put together.  If you enjoy being scared then I highly recommend this game.  I can only give it three stars because I really have not played very much and don't know how in depth the game really is.  I would give it five stars for frightening!!!!!!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I like Play tube which is much more like u tube. V tube does not work that way. That is it
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Good movie with a lot of action. The shooting skills portrayed in the movie were some near impossible shots. Mark Wahlberg did a great job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really addicting i would get the game.besides u yolo!<br /><br />Goodbye.<br /><br />Text me if you have any other info and look up subwaysurfers guide.
B000FBFM9S|5.0|A great read, commentary on everything from patriarchy, identity, gender, freedom, friendship, family, social stigma, religion, and much much more.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a dream of my life it is my favorite game to play.I even play with my friends with their kindle fire.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|1) Thank you Amazon for giving us free quality apps this year, this is among the best.<br />2) It drives me crazy how people mistake Darwins evolution with creation theories. Clearly this is a creation program because the same species gets smaller or larger, it Never morphs to Another species- again clearly dispelling Darwins theory of evolution. They can't even reproduce it in computer simulations.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Excellent job scripting hours of play no chance of boredom less u r one of the guys on big bang theory
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I finally decided to jump on the bandwaggon only to find everyone else already jumped off. The app is clean and stable on my Samsung Galaxy SII phone and Note 10.1, it's nice being able to check my friend's (singular) tweets once a week, but may not be able to justify the space on my devices vs. checking from a PC. If I have to make space decisions, this one's the first to go.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun an addicting I love playing with other people online. The only thing I do not like is how long some training takes for tournaments
B0095P33IW|4.0|I enjoyed Cpt America immensely, but thought the technology displayed for WW-II era times was way over the top - requires a major suspension of belief to digest. Well, you have to do that to believe that 2 minutes in a capsule can change a man's physiology and physic so drastically. So there you go. Suspend beliefs and enjoy the fantasy. Very adventure-packed. Nice romantic hints. Funny to some extent. Leads up nicely to The Avengers which I rated 5 stars.
B007HO392S|5.0|My first Carrie Underwood CD and it is amazing! Her voice is so beautiful and rich this is a must have. Highly recommend!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I got this as a birthday gift for my wife, who's already seen the entire series several times. I'm looking forward to watching the DVD extras during the summer, when we really need a DA fix.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|&#34;The Swerve&#34; is a stunning read, both in its subject matter and in the writing style of the author, Stephen Greenblatt.  It is also ironic that fairly recently in the news was the resignation of Pope Benedict, and as the media reported, the first resignation of a pope in 600 years.  Ironic because it is the resignation of that pope 600 years ago that allowed the subject matter of &#34;The Swerve&#34; to come about.  Poggio Bracciolini, Papal Secretary to the antipope John XXIII, found himself with free time on his hands after John XXIII's resignation.  He used that free time to unearth one of the greatest treasures of the ancient world.  I won't repeat Greenblatt's story here.  It's a must read.  I will say that Greenblatt's descriptions of the unwarranted slam the followers of Epicurus endured, the Catholic Church's embracing of pain rather than pleasure, and Lucretius' accurate foretelling not of Atomic theory, but subatomic theory as well as Darwinian evolution, are magical joys.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm a professional musician and I see these headphones in many studios. They sound wonderful and are very true. They are a good reference set of headphones. I own more expensive headphones but when I listen to my mixes in these it's just more &#34;true&#34; than my other big name more expensive German-made phones.<br /><br />Get them.
B001NZB5GO|5.0|A CLASSIC MOVIE WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL CAST. A 30S MOVIE THAT IS TIMELESS!!!! AN MGM PRODUCTION THAT DOESN'T MISS A BEAT.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy and captivating read. Great imagination and characters.  I saw the movie first and still enjoyed the book even knowing how it was going to end.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|This is a strange collection of songs. Some straight ahead blues and rock with some hip-hoppy R&B tracks mixed in. It seems Gary is trying to hedge his bets and appeal to as many people as possible but the result is disjointed and jarring in my opnion. It isn't that either style is bad or that he does any of it poorly, it just seems like it should be two different records. Also, the hip-hop tracks sound kind of forced and not as natural to me like Clark was just trying to improve his mass appeal without really committing to it.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|muy bueno el final de esta saga, y muy fiel a el Comic original, bien lograda y con mucha accion.
B0079NQZLE|5.0|I am kinda weird in the fact that I like this movie which is full of kids killing each other, but it's a step into an alternate world.  it arrived in perfect condition and quickly.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|The whole book confirms the known fact - anyone is able to achieve success with the idea he's passionate about. The passion about your idea, the vision of the product developed from that idea are the key factors in building the successful start-up. Simply written, easy to read and very inspiring.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|When you were an elementary student you were not allowed to end a story with the ending - &#34;And then they woke up and it was all a dream&#34;  This inane film uses that ending countless times.  If you like Kung-Fu sillyness, you will appreciate Inception.  If you like an honest story, forget wasting 90 minutes of your life on this mess of a story.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Total fun and hilarious movie!!! PERFECT for anyone!! It goes to show you that looks can be decieving and don't judge people before you hear them out!! :)
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This movie is wonderful. Finally an intelligent kids movie that you won't cringe when they say they want to watch it again. Loved it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I appreciated the action, the interaction between Pi and the animals, especially the tiger!<br />Amazing what can be done to bring animals into action!!  Also the double story ..which<br />makes you think.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is just a fun game to play on late nights, specially if your a horse lover ! I recommend this game :)
B008NB0SQO|5.0|Every year since my children were small we would plug in this movie and decorate the house. I have purchased this movie for every child dear to me. I have the audio playing in my car at Christmas time. It is just plain fun and every household with children will enjoy this movie. Very well done!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game. it is very addictive.  just bate. waiting. for my energy to restore.  just want to keep playing.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|For me I felt as though I was having to push myself to read it as he was in his walk. So much was such a downer. At times there was hope because someone else would show their faith. I have very mixed feeling about this book. I was glad true love was renewed. I am not sure who I would encourage Anyone to read this book because of the overall down and out depressing people in it.
B001LM1456|5.0|I was an avid fan of the television series, The Hulk, back in the 70's.  I don't know which storyline the comics follow, but it was fun seeing an up to date twist on the old show.  Even more fun to see the cameos of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferigno!!  My husband, my three girls and I all enjoyed it very much!!
B007STXHTM|5.0|At my age I don't dive but I do sometimes get out in very wet weather and would like to do some photography and video under those conditions.  One feature I really wanted was the large flat lens port.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Even though I have 3 girls (ages 12, 13 and 15), this movie was a hit with everyone in the family - my husband too!  He has been inundated with princesses and such over the years, so it's great to find a movie we all like and not just tolerate!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|From the Impossible Astronaut on, Moffat's stories and the direction for the characters make this one of the most engaging seasons that I can recall.  If these stories were just stand alone stories, they would be great.  But, the fact that they fit together in a really interesting story arc adds so much more to the viewing experience.  Great season!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|It's so wonderful to find a movie that the whole family can watch together and enjoy!!  So happy to find kid movie that are not animated.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Only people with diminished understanding abilities dislike this show. I'm so sick of the arguments from poltroons that keep asking &#34;Well what about the polar bear&#34; You idiots you are missing out on the complete brilliance of the show if you keep harping on an question that was already answered. Almost everything in the show can be explained if you think about it for a second if you have a decent iq for f's sake.
B009ZW9DU2|4.0|First of all, I love cats and secondly Bob not only was a cat but he did a remarkable thing in return for the home that he &#34;found', by bringing a man back to being a person who was an upright citizen
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters and backdrop of this time period make for an interesting plot. Characters are either appropriately lovable or the kind we all love to hate. Good show.
B0086700CM|4.0|Love this game...Especially when the birds are chasing me up close.  It is exhilarating, trying and frustrating all wrapped up in one. Also love all the captionings when you mess up a run.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best,  all three books.  Everyone should read them, especially the last one when you will know the reason for Christians ways.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Loved all of the Sons Seasons...Am waiting for when the Season 5 season will be available to be seen for Free from Amazon Prime like the others.  Sound could be a little louder.  I left a review previously on this.  It is one of my favorite shows to watch.  Addicting!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like this book because it shows with courage you can accomplish anything, especially with a friend, real or otherwise.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I was disappointed.  We were looking for a better storyline.  Lots of time spent on doing drugs and drinking alcohol and explicit nudity.  Not one of his better movies.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I play a lot of find it games and I do like this one. Keeps me interested and isn't too hard of too easy. I like the different worlds.
B003U4UPHG|2.0|Love the first season although man of the characters begin to do stupid things and become rather annoying towards the end of the first season. This is amplified in the second season and it almost seems like the writers ran out of story so they just began to make it up as they went. If this wasn't on prime I would not pay for it, I'm having a very difficult time finishing the second season as is.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was well written. it kept my interest, but somewhat depressing.  Not a great book to read on vacation.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE FOR ALL AGES. VERY FUNNY FOR A MOVIE MORE TOWARDS KIDS. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a quick read and nice story.....sad, but interesting perspective.  Definitely worth it to put on your &#34;to read&#34; list.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE AS I'M A PROUD TWIHARD AND I LOVE HOW FAST THIS MOVIE CAME AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Child is consistent with his wonderfully compelling character Reacher.  Each book is a page turner and the only negative for me is that they are over before I'm ready.

B00BESM14U|5.0|I watched this with my teen daughter and we both enjoyed it. Much smarter than your regular teen-type movie. It reminded me of Harold and Maude (but without the suicide).

B003SI605K|3.0|The movie left me somewhat disappointed after such an amazing book. I read the book in my high school class, and I was really looking forward to watching the movie. However, the parts that were so beautifully written by Amy Tan in the book, came across as pretty corny in the movie. And some scenes seemed to be just pulled out of thin air. Nonetheless, the movie was entertaining and kept me engaged for over two hours.
1400064627|4.0|Fried Green Tomatoes was one of my favorite movies growing up, although at this point, I probably haven't seen it in 10 years.  So I thought I would revisit the charming story in its original novel format, and it didn't disappoint.  The format was different than I expected, with chapters occurring during different time periods, whether in Depression era Whistle Stop, Alabama, or at a nursing home in Birmingham in 1986.  Some chapters are simply gossip columns and others are from the perspective of various secondary characters.  The book included more commentary on racial issues in the south than I expected, but it effectively portrayed the attitude of the time.<br /><br />The heart of the story of course is Idgie and Ruth, their caf&eacute; and the community.  Though there has been much commentary about Idgie and Ruth being lesbians, I never felt there was anything overtly gay about their relationship. There were no scenes with them making out or anything that specifically defined them as lovers.  I absolutely loved the interactions between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgood. Though the ending was dramatically different than the movie, it still worked. I recognized many lines from the movie that were taken verbatim from the book.  Because I have such high esteem for a movie that helped define my youth, there were some aspects of the book that didn't resonate with me.  However, that also enabled me to mentally visualize so many of the scenes and the characters. Regardless, it was the friendships portrayed on these pages were so authentic and inspiring.  Now I'm going to have to dust off the old VCR and see if my video copy still works!
B003WJQ74E|4.0|\\"He really pulled a Charlie Gordon that time.  I don't know why they say it but they always laff and I laff too\\" is what his co-workers would say in this diary style story of a mentally challenged 32 year old man who has many dreams and a lot of \\"motor vation\\" as he would write.<br /><br />The main character of this story is about Charlie Gordon. He tells us his journey through a series of \\"progris riports\\" that he writes. In this diary stylebook, Charlie Gordon is a mentally disabled 32-year-old man who wants to become a smarter/better person by becoming more intelligent. He takes \\"Special\\" classes at the \\"Beekmin collidge center for retarted adults\\" as he would write. He also was chosen for an experimental operation that would give him an intelligence boost and possibly end \\"retardation\\". Charlie decided to take the operation despite the fact that it could make him more mentally disabled than he was before the operation because he really wants to achieve his dream of becoming more intelligent and having advanced conversations like college students. But, he began to suffer from a series of recurring dreams about his past that ultimately leads him on a journey to find out who he truly is and what his past was as well before he became self aware about who he was before the operation.<br />The characters that are presented in this book are authentic and unique. Charlie, the main character, is unique and complex as well. He is unique because he is not the average mentally disabled man. I say this because he is full of integrity and is a very complex person who experiences many different and new emotions throughout the book that he has never felt before. Another unique character is the woman the main character falls in love with. The name of the woman is Miss Kinnian. She also has a great importance in the book because he causes Charlie to feel many new mature feelings in which confuse him and make him struggle on how to balance the new feelings he is experiencing.<br />The storyline of this book is very interesting. First, it is very riveting. It is very riveting because it keeps you excited and wanting more due to the fact that it gets really emotional and personal and Charlie uses these progress reports as a Coping mechanism and outlet to get his sadness and anger out. One if the scene where it becomes emotional is when he describes his feeling towards his sister.  Charlie writes, \\"I see now that when Norma flowered in our garden I became a weed, allowed to exist only where I could not be seen, in corners and dark places. Seeing her face in the newspaper, I suddenly hated her\\". In this scene Charlie writes about how in a way his mother discards him and replaces him for his younger \\"normal\\" sister and he becomes a shadow in the family that no one loves. This also has an authentic feel to it, which makes it very believable because we can relate to his feelings about his sister because we often have problems with our siblings and we can picture his anger and jealousy because we often have underwent the same thing.<br />The storyline is a little cliché because of the overplayed main character falls in love and so does the woman with him then they have to go through some problems with their relationship etc. But, this book is also set up in an interesting way that makes it amazing. The way this is set up is almost like a diary and through it you notice how the character changes. The way this story is told is through progress reports and they contain many spelling and grammatical errors. But as you read more and more, Charlie's child like writing turns into the work of a genius. This book gives a voice to the voiceless in a society who seems to love to discriminate and that are always there and are always going to be there but the human race seems to look at them as if they were shadows because they are always there but we seem to act like we don't seem to see or notice them. What this book also brings up is so many controversial and current problems in society. One of the main topics is Societies opinion in mentally handicapped people in our society and we seem to lock them away in mental institution's to \\"protect\\" them but in reality we do that to keep them away from the \\"normal\\" in society because in a way this reminds us that mistakes could happen to anyone and fear is what fuels this discrimination towards them of how this could happen to us or our children/family.<br />In the end, this book reaches its purpose to give a voice to the voiceless that, in the end, are still often ignored. Even while this book is doing this, it tells a great story that will want you to keep reading more and more even if you are not a fan of the classic science fiction novel.
1451627297|5.0|Being a Stephen King fan, I was eager to see what he did with this subject.  I found it enjoyable.  The overall theme was intereting in that one small change of events can alter numerous others (the domino effect).  King fans won't be disappointed.
0307346617|3.0|The zombies came, destroyed, and got destroyed. Now it's time to stop history from repeating itself.<br /><br />In World War Z: An oral History of the Zombie War, Max Brooks presents a recollection of testimonies from people who survived the zombie war. Unlike most zombie-related media, this book is about what life for what how responded to the zombie apocalypse and how their life is after it. Think of the 90's Twilight: Los Angeles but about zombie attacks and prepare for a zombie apocalypse themed commentary on society.<br /><br />In regards to characters, we've seen it all before. Although the reader is treated to a fairly large assortment of characters, ranging from everyday people to those who have been involved in the government's affairs, they're nothing new. The book's subject departs from traditions and clichés in its genre its genre but its characters do not. Some of them, though, are very relatable. A character most people will, and should, familiarize with is a mother who was worried about \\". . . my car payments and Tim's business loans. I was worried about widening crack in the pool and the new non-chlorinated filter that still left an algae film. I was worried about our portfolio, even though my e-broker assured me this was just first-time investor jitters and that it was much more profitable than a standard 401(k) . . . These were just some of my worries. I had more than enough to keep me busy.\\" Granted, many people don't have the luxury about worrying about some of these things but they still can't deny their own materialistic worries are a higher priority than some epidemic happening far away.<br /><br />There is no overall plot. The book doesn't follow a single character around. Rather, it has interviews with different people. Think of this book as asking a group of parents how their experiences with raising their children instead of going in-depth into the life of one child. Some of the stories feel very predictable but that is due to the fact that we all know they're being told by the people who lived through it so, it's obvious they survived.<br /><br />Due to the variety of characters, the book's prose suffers.. Keep in mind, though that this is a book about what life was like during a zombie apocalypse. There is a character that is in a rehabilitation home, one that was the former White House chief of staff, and someone who used to be and actor.  The book's characters have different, stories, backgrounds, and levels of intelligence so don't expect too much anaphora or symbolism. The best instance of figurative language one will find in this book comes from a young Englishman that took refuge from zombies in a castle. The dialogue and figurative language, however, and they are the whole purpose of this book. The dialogue is and authentic and the figurative language paints a really good picture of the environment the characters were in and of the zombies themselves. For example, a veteran of a battle against zombies describes his experience by saying \\"We saw bodies blown to shit, tossed into the air, ripped to pieces even complete heads, live heads with eyes and jaws still moving, popping sky high like freakin' crystal corks . . . The stream was now like a river, a flood of bodies slouching, moaning, stepping over their mangled bros as they rolled slowly and steadily toward us like a slow-motion wave.\\"<br /><br />The book provides an interesting look at how humanity might react to a zombie catastrophe and is, to the imaginative mind, a good allegory on how society is currently reacting to world epidemics. Despite that, World War Z will appeal more to those who already enjoy post-apocalyptic horror, or have already read The Zombie Survival Guide.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Its really fun and addicting. Cant put it down at times;) love the special rooms they add for different holidays

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story was recommended to me by a friend. It was cheap and sounded interesting, so I figured why not? This turned out to be one of the best stories I have ever read! An interesting but easy read that gives a terrifying glimpse of a possible future. Everyone should read this! I know I'll be getting the rest of these books!
0525478817|5.0|If you are ready to go on a rollercoaster of emotions were you often like to laugh, shed a tear or two and feel in love, why not experience all; The Fault In Our Stars is the best rollercoaster you can be on.<br /><br />In the book The Fault In Our Stars, Hazel who is a sixteen years old has terminal cancer and lives her life as a side effect until Augustus, her new social group friend, comes to change her way of life a little. Hazel, as she first starts to experience love, doesn't want to be a \\"grenade\\" to Augustus and her parents because she thinks she knows she is going to die and leave them all with a broken heart. But of course love is not a manageable thing when we are talking about a young gentleman and parents who really care.<br /><br />The author John Green does an excellent job at conveying an emotional tone where you are transported into amazing experiences. This is because there are often the times were the book is funny, romantic and tragic. As John Green says, \\"Books belong to their readers,\\" for me the theme was that things happen unjustly but it is up to you to turn the bad luck around and make your life worth living, this is even part of the quote used for the title of the book: \\"The fault in our stars\\" by Julius Caesar, were (even though it said that the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves) it is slightly incorrect because cancer for Hazel and Augustus was not their choice, it was not their fault.<br /><br />The plot of this story is very interesting and full of plot twists. It was not predictable for the same reason that whatever you think may happen does not end up happening, which enables this book to be majorly emotional. In one of the scenes Hazel wants to meet the author of An Imperial Affliction, her favorite book, and Peter (the author) comes out to being totally unpredictable.<br /><br />The character Hazel Grace is a very unique and complex character. In the book Hazel can be very fun and loose, but at the same time she knows whento be a serious person and an understandable person as well. She is unique because she is a very interesting person when getting to know her. At first you think she is just girl that feels sorry for herself because she has cancer, but she acts like a normal teen. She is finding love, and most people with cancer would not want to be with someone with cancer in fear of being hurt in the end.<br /><br />Augustus Waters is a very unique and relatable person. He is a relatable person because he cares for his friends like I do. He treats them like they are family, like I do with my friends. He is very understanding and he listens to friends when they are in need like if they are sad, or angry with someone. He is unique because he has one leg and acts like it is nothing, and he knows when to stop joking around and to get serious. He knows how to make someone feel better when the are having problems, and he cares for their problems before he starts to care for his own problems.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, dialogue is widely used. It helps the reader understand the character's thoughts of themselves and of each other. Even though there is a lot of dialogue being used, the author is still able to tell the story in an interesting way. He does use some figurative language but he keeps it at a minimum.<br /><br />I never really paid attention towards what cancer people go through. This book made me feel emotional. This book teaches many things and one of them is to value my life even if i face any health problems. It will take you to experiences you will never imagine..
B008476HBM|5.0|Dreams do come true in Ms. Austen's book Pride and Prejudice! Favorite characters? Of course, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy... Oh, the romantic tension that developed between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, even though they both tried to hide their love for each other because of their Pride and Prejudice, was splendid! A forever romance book for keeps for every \\"happily ever after\\" romantic who believes in true love no matter what... ~The end :)

0061743526|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is an American classic. It deserves to be required reading in every high school classroom. Harper Lee creates an intricate tale of suspense set in the South during the 1930s. The story makes statements about prejudice and justice that transcend time, speaking to audiences of the modern era.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|After 2 weeks spent with Jane Austin, Wuthering Heights was a rude awakening.  It is hard to believe that a character as evil as Heathcliff could be imagined.  There was no redemption for him even in death.  Read (and enjoy) at your own peril.

B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Got 2 of these for my 240 radiator.  WOW . . what a difference . . around 10 - 12 celciius actually.  on 50- 60% RPM, it's inaudible.<br />Around 75% i can start to hear it a bit inside my swiftech 820 case.  at 100% during stress test it's just a little louder than the pump but still not annoyingly so.<br />love the accessories it came with: y-cable, extension cable, low noise adaptor.  I can see some people needing the extension cable as the connector wire on the fan was almost exact for my setup.<br />All in all, you get what you pay for.  Def plan on buying a few more.  Not worried about making everything match inside my case.  So if the noctua clolor scheme annoys you, I guess you could always paint the fan as some people have done or just buy another fan of your liking.

B0080CKGZE|5.0|The Robert Pattinson character starts out poor. Dickens poor. But this is France, so, with an extra bit of haughtiness  on the part of everyone else. He meets an old chum from military days. The chum helps RP out. RP helps himself to everyone's wives. The women are quite willing and Pattinson sleeps his way up the social ladder. Then, the husbands, of wealth and position, get crabby about it and try to break Robert. But, heck, he has been a vampire and he knows his way around a plot line. I won't tell you what he does, but I approve. I actually liked this movie. I recommend it...

1439156816|5.0|I'd never read Stephen King before, thinking of him as something of a pot boiler thriller writer. Of course I'd heard he was a real writer, but still. Well he is indeed a real writer and this is a good writing book. I would have been happy with bio and more writing advice. I also like [[ASIN:0874771641 Becoming a Writer]].
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very addicting game. Plays well. Fun for kids and adults. Also very useful for teaching one to \\"think outside the box\\" while being inside the box. You may need a few tries to solve but you'll get it. Also the hint key is always a plus. In two words...GREAT FUN!  *****
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Fun and Superb Acting!  Let's you peek at a life and time that we would never otherwise know about or be able to relate!  The costume and sets are spectacular!  Just to watch Maggie Smith act is worth everything to me!

030758836X|1.0|Just finished this and I would consider it the worst book I have ever read.  I go through a lot of books and thought I would read a best seller.  Typically I read history, non-fiction and suspense books but thought, why not try something different.  As I got further into this mess of a book, I already didn't like the pattern of writing, but keep thinking something would break.  As I read the last page I actually had to go back to the previous page to be sure that was it!  Terrible, and if I could give it minus stars I would.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm looking forward to season four. Excelent acting, beautiful costumes and overall superb scenery. Can't say enough about the castle.

B009NYF2ES|5.0|We've waited a long time for a Blu-ray of Cabaret, but its been worth the wait. Not only is the film now presented in a correct widescreen version (rather than that ridiculous &#34;letterboxed into a 4:3 frame&#34; presentation used for the DVD) but the sound is now in 5.1 surround for the first time (The initial 1972 film release used a four-track magnetic soundtrack, so the original materials would have been available for a 5.1 DVD version).<br /><br />I'm not going to pretend that the picture quality is excellent, because it isn't. Film grain is apparent, especially on the Kit-Kat club scenes, but I put that down to the use of relatively low light levels during filming, rather than to any fault in the transfer.  I would always far rather have a bit of film grain showing, where that is present on the original negative, than an overly agressive use of noise reduction during transfer.
030759565X|5.0|Bought it for a gift - think I'm going to have to order one for myself. Beautiful, beautiful cookbook with a yummy assortment of recipes. Very happy with purchase!

B006AZZPCM|2.0|This did not help with viewing YouTube.  And be careful! Some programs may have viruses.  Luckily nothing happened to me.  It's best just to go on YouTube via the internet and watch videos that way.
B0012FHGCW|1.0|Worst movie ever, they built this movie up to a huge climax point and then just ended it without showing the climax, ridiculous
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This app is very useful; it is the best calculator app on the Android Market. This calculator is versatile, and great for any task requiring a financial, statistical, scientific, or basic addition and subtraction functionality. Thank you for this great app.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Its quite an interesting take on how to do a documentary.  It is half about the greats that created their records at Sound City, and half about the sound board that made the records so great.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great, I hated the concept though. The &#34;haves&#34; taking advantage of the &#34;have nots&#34;. Using the &#34;have nots&#34; as sport.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I really enjoied watching this movie with my kids.  There are happy and sad parts that make this movie truly enjoyable.  Even my 6 year old said &#34;Mom, there were sad parts that I really liked becasue they were happy too&#34;.  Once you watch it, you will understand.
B000MR1V22|5.0|I love this move and watch it every time I it comes on. The whole cast is just amazing and the story is both funny, touching, crazy, and endearing all at the same time. A great character study, but with heart.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Very informative, and it is actually  CLEAN MOVIE..Not many are made that have a &#34;PLOT&#34; and are &#34;CLEAN&#34;. I would recommend this movie to anyone..
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Great game for all ages.<br /><br />I have one problem tho...Bonus book star-level 9 won't unlock. I have 1-8 done.<br /><br />Please fix issue.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Only album can let you think of such deep things but present them to you in such a simple yet beautiful language
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Excellent reading!  Puts her in the category of must read authors.  A  difficult  subject, well handled,  presented in the form  of a good story.  I have started my next one already.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This one had me hooked from the beginning, the different realities are very clever.  OK, it is a bit obvious when the characters are in the alternative reality (could have been more subtle) but that isn't the point of the book.  Interesting characters you want to read about make this book.  Excellent.
B007G8SET8|5.0|A few core members left, Saxon give me a reason to grow old, not gracefully, but kicking as*.  Biff and the boys put on a show I guarantee bands 1/4 their age could not match.  Great Music . . . Great Show!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A nice twist in the middle. I kept waiting for a double bluff or two but I guess since I carried on waiting til the very end the story managed to keep me unsure and moving with it regardless.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|Apart from being a little irritating that the word &#34;guy&#34; is used over and over again, I found the plot a little thin; sometimes the plot strayed too far from reality and as a military man I found a few irritating issues such as senior, and I mean VERY senior personnel who were unaware of what IFF is?!<br /><br />That being said, I still finished the book and all in all I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I'll try another before I give up.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This is set as if the whole story is part of a theater stage production, but it made it had to follow. You get the story line but it was fractured in presentation.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Love that song great CD I recomened it to others and bought some candy to eat while listening to it HAAHHH
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|A little more limited than I expected. But it my be more fun for others. No musical experience needed to jump right in.
B0085N604Y|5.0|Snow feather touch , one amazing group although you do not look for fame it is on your doorstep open the door.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works good when your away from a calculator or just sitting and relaxing and need to add something up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice. I love the idea of the game. Just like having your own horse. But the feed and stuff could be less expensive.<br />But very cool :))
1401201911|5.0|Ok I couldn't help myself with the title but here goes: The book was awesome! The concept was unique and executed perfectly. The artwork was really sharp and probably some of my personal favorite. There was a nice spin not only on Superman and Lex Luthor but also on the cameos from Batman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern. I couldn't put the book down once I started and ended up reading in one sitting. Great story, awesome ending, pick this one up and add it to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I been playing this game since last year it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love love love love love it.Plus It is Rome
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|definately worth a watch.  was such a breath of fresh air compared to the garbage hollywood has been putting out lately!!!
B0086700CM|3.0|it was an OK game but after a while it can get verrrrrrry boring. Free app so yeah bye peeps
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Not as complete as Google on the PC but very handy for the Kindle. Take a little to get used to, but what doesn't with something new.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I enjoy this app. It allows me to get on twitter and it is easy to navigate.Some times the feed is a little old but I think it might be my personal internet connection.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I thought the acting was very good and excellent story and at times, kept you on the edge of your chair.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Sad ending<br />Really great writing...but hoped for a better ending..hopefully the next book picks up where this one left off
B003YL4LYI|5.0|These books continue to amaze me with their character depth and detail.  I have been hoarding this last book knowing that I will have to wait for the next one to be released.  A friend of mine just told me to start reading them again from the beginning.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Anyone who loves the supernatural, should own this series. Hands down, the greatest.  I highly recommend this  for your library.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|This Blu-ray transfer of one of my favorite movies simply blows away the DVD copy I've owned for a few years. This is a really excellent transfer and I highly recommend it to anyone that appreciates a great viewing experience.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I highly recommend this for your library.  Lots of awesome, intense moments.  A must have for any serious supernatural fan.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love game, but it stalled out on me after I bought scarlet fox. Your fix it team suggested pressing \\"force close\\" which didn't light up. Uninstalled, reinstalled but now am afraid it'll happen again. Lost all my achievements,but have rebuilt.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love them getting into the prison, all the twists and turns and surprises.  Can't wait each week for the new episode!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love Kate Morton! Her books are so descriptive of the era you feel like you are there! I love how she slowly reveals her characters, her books are hard to put down! If you love mysteries, you will love her books
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Who knew a zombie apocalypse could be so much fun!  This show is a perfect balance of gore and storyline.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Not that bad for a dictionary that is so long and so cool for people like my friends and me
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|...but this series ended at the right time. there was probably no room left in the story line for this to become another Harry Potter. Ms. Collins struk while the iron was hot and left us wanting just a bit more. perfect!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a very great book. No that doesn't even describe it at all. One of the best books I have ever read. If I could. It would be 10 stars
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It's a really good app. I use it a lot at school.it helps me keep notes and do lots of stuff. stuff I use it everyday!
1439130833|5.0|I rate this product a 5, because it changes people's lives. It basically transformed mine.<br />I did recommend all of Rhonda's items to my hole family as in my kids.<br /><br />Thank you Rhonda for your amasing books God should remain to bless you.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I've been a fan since the 70's. In my opinion, this is by far his worst to date. He borrowed every song, and his talents are not at all on display. There's nothing but old, tired music here. Cheesy raggae, uninspired country...even some Gershwin. Good grief! I think the name &#34;Old Sock&#34; fits quite well.
0374214913|4.0|I love the way the author has captured this moment in time with all of the hope and promise of technology, tensions that exist as a result of the technological revolution, and the effects of our current economic situation on the underemployed. It is a funny, inspiring, and entertaining book!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it, its entertaining and fun, my 4 year old also like it. Its difficult so no boring ok.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Such a nice friendly Parliament House Whip. So accommodating, with a smile for everyone. And so content with his place in the party hierarchy. But watch out -- everything may not be as it seems.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Okay, John McClain is back with his son and daughter. John is in Russia. John `inadvertently' gets involved with an international spy mission. John survives some of the most amazing visual feats of action and stunts that Superman is the  only other person that would be able to make it through.<br /><br />What am I talking about? Director John Moore (Max Payne, Behind Enemy Lines) takes on the 5th adventure of the New York ex-cop, John McClain, in \\"A Good day To Die Hard\\". (Actually the title is a derivative of a famous Star Trek Klingon quote, but oh well I digress.) From a script written by Skip Woods (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The A-Team) and using characters originally created by Roderick Thorp four movies ago, the movie is a series of things that happen one after the other and like the previous films our star, Bruce Willis (The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction) takes us on another rollercoaster ride of action and adventure set in Russia.<br /><br />Trying to catch up with his son because he doesn't know exactly what he is doing in Russia, it all becomes a foreign land to Bruce which makes it a little bit of the fish out of water story, but you can see the patterns of the old films roll out one by one. A convincing performance is done by Jai Courtney (Jack Reacher, Spartacus: War of the Damned) as Bruce's son with a hidden agenda.<br /><br />Sebastian Koch (Black Book, Unknown) does a great job as the Russian persona with a secret code that the entire cast of the film is trying to get a hold of, including Bruce's son. A little predictable in areas of where the characters were going, but one or two surprise were to be had. Russian actress Yuliya Snigir (Kokoko, Obitaemyy) is new to American audiences and does a fine job as the daughter of Sebastian. She too has a weird twist or two in the film.<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing, Scott Pilgrim vs The World) reprises her role as the daughter in this film, but isn't really seen much and doesn't have a to do.<br /><br />Now there is a little miss-direction too, when a `villain' played by Rasha Bikvic (Taken, The Heir Apparent: Largo Witch) leads the audience to think there is something going on when actually there isn't and the real `villain' is revealed. Sound confusing? It was to me too, a little. Then they unraveled everything fairly quickly.<br /><br />This movie is a little long and the best thing it has going for it are the amazing, yet unrealistic, John McClain Franchise style stunts and action sequences, especially a `chopping' helicopter finale. Other than that it was a little `ho-hum' for me - except again for the action sequences. I would wait for the blu ray or Netflix on this one.r /><br />Now there is a little miss-direction too, when a `villain' played by Rasha Bikvic (Taken, The Heir Apparent: Largo Witch) leads the audience to think there is something going on when actually there isn't and the real `villain' is revealed.

030746363X|5.0|Like many reviwers have said, not necessarily all cutting edge information but alot of it is very good and some original stuff included. Conversational style is easy to read and digest, and I'm currently trying the Slo Carb diet. Its worked like a charm so far but only 1 week in. If it continues at this pace the book will really have earned its 5 stars.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|HAS GREAT STORY LINE. THE GUARDIANS ARE ARE GREAT TEACHERS. THE STORY STAYS TO THE TITLE. YOU WILL LAUGH AND ALSO FEEL A LITTLE MAD. BUT ALL IN ALL, IT IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was better than I thought it would be. Love it. Much better than the movie. I highly recommend.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was great...got a little techy for me about all the kinds of guns but the story is amazing as was Chris Kyle.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|I had read Nikki's other book,which I very much enjoyed,so I had to read this one. It was a look into life on the road,and the deep spiral out of control of his life. Some parts where pretty disturbing,but given the title and his past you must expect it. It was a diary of his days and very well written I thought,it sucks you in and you can't put it down.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Oh, I am so glad I did not go to the theater and paid a lot of money. This was an okay family movie. My 9 yr old enjoyed it, but I had higher expectations. I really don't know what I was expecting, but the movie was a little bit boring at times. I did enjoy the scenary and the movie had a possitive message. Other than that, nothing unforgettable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the best shows on tv right now...........period!!!!<br />Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed!!
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Robert Pattinson did a great job of portraying a cad in the movie Bel Ami.  I would recommend this overlooked movie to anyone who is a fan of Rob's.
0756666937|5.0|This will give my Grandson lots to think about.  I'm looking forward to him using his imagination and seeing his creations.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|So far a nice game. ran down my battery playing this game. now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to playing it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My Grandson, told me about this game, and he wanted me to play along with him, so I got this game.  I enjoy playing with him,, and he shows me how to move, and build, and all the others things.  I like being part of my Grandson's interests.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is really fun! My 3 boys--7, 9 and 11 all love to play this. We've also enjoyed Temple Run 2.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Love this!!!  Works great on my kindle fire!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the air ship.  Can someone please tell me how to get the airship to move higher on the kindle fire?!?!  Please please help!!  Other than that love it!!  Need more rpg games like this to be available!  If you don't like the price then you are obviously not a fan of the final fantasy games!!  Want more!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Even my 4 year old loves to play this. It is very fun and simple! My son says, you can be a real ninja by playing this game!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My oldest son has been asking for this a couple of weeks.  Bought it two weeks ago and he is still going strong playing it.  We also have Angry Birds - Star Wars.  He prefers the Space version.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I purchased this watch hoping to be rid of battery power or a manual (finger) wind up.  The SNK809 worked great for the first six months.  After this period, the watch would not take a mechanical charge at night (sleep).  I guess I didn't move enough to generate enough energy to 'charge' the movement.  I would have to reset the watch each morning.  This worked for several months than the SNK809 stopped working completely.  I'm sorry to say perhaps this Seiko 5 is inferior to the standard Seiko.  I will not purchase another Seiko 5.
B0052VI2WA|4.0|Overall the album sounded pretty good in 5.1 surround.  Seems like some liberties were taken regarding more use of reverb for example in Mood for a Day.  Highlights include South Side of the Sky, We Have Heaven and America.  Roundabout was okay with the guitar sounding a bit too processed in the instrumental sections.  I was expecting a bit more on Long Distance Runaround but it didn't really get exciting until The Fish.  Also the general mix of Long Distance Runaround sounds better in stereo.  The same with Heart of the Sunrise.  It did seem like the guitar in almost every song was considerably louder than the other instruments.  Steve Howe should be pleased!  For the most part I think the engineers could have played a bit more with the surround.<br /><br />Otherwise good album to have in your SACD/DTS collection.<br /><br />Update:  With the new 5.1 remixes of Yes albums now rolling out this particular album should be interesting in comparing the two.  As of this writing you can compare \\"America\\" with the new \\"Close to the Edge\\" 5.1 album.  Both are very different.  In fact I've read Steve Howe being displeased with this particular release cause of the incorrect use of takes.<br /><br />My SACD setup: Sony BDP-S590/Yamaha RX-V373
B00BHMF578|5.0|I never liked Ben Affleck in the 90's.  However, he has really matured and this film is proof positive.  A must see if you enjoy true story dramas.
B00778GL0G|5.0|Received it just fine and it all worked. I'm not sure if my friend enjoyed it, but we bought season 2 to go with it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is entertaining but time consuming.  I like the graphics but I wish there were more ways to interact with the horse.  Overall I give it a thumbs up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is so easy to use.  The auto move feature makes your game fast fun and very stress releaving.  I do prefer the simple version of all black.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Its a good app. You can download any song for free. My only problem is that its sometimes slow but its awsome...
B006MW3V6U|1.0|The first part did a skip thing a few times but all of the first disk is ok.  I have not looked at the other two as I just got it last night.  But unlike the first season dvd's I got from Acorn, the case is not broken .Yea<br /><br />I watched the last 2 disc last night  and was sorrly dissapionted.  They have left out half of the story on 3 different characters.  I do not recomend this item.  I want to send it back so i hope i can  DON'T buy this item.<br /><br />I had a broken case on the first season dvd I bought from Acorn and they sent me another dvd and case of  the first season free of charge
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son and I spent a perfect snow day watching this movie - great show, cute for a 6 year old would-be gamer.
B005ES0YA4|4.0|This is my second pair and they are slightly smaller than my first, but not enough that they don't fit. They are also considerably less &#34;spongy&#34; on the bottom. Still very comfortable.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters and it is amazing so it's worth watching. But DO NOT get the instant video version. It's a terrible copy. It's really blurry & the sound is terrible. Very low def. I felt like I was watching a bootleg copy. I watched 3 mintutes of it and had to shut it off.<br />Either rent the hard copy version or wait for them to post a HD instant video. But don't watch this one. There is no way it's worth the money.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald said, \\"Show me a hero, and I will write you a tragedy.\\" Denzel Wasingtion delivers a five-star performance of a flawed man with heroic capabilities, but then the carefully drawn persona turns to mush when a PC ending in tacked on to the tale. Reviewers, I note, seemed to like and dislike this movie for wildly varying reasons. Personally, I wanted to see the anit-hero theme (which is seldom portrayed in mainstream films these days) carried through to the end, to see Whip beat the committee once again and then fly out over the blue Pacific in his dads' cropduster, vodka as a co-pilot, on the last heroic mission available to him. This ending most likely would have been depised by most audience members, but I think it would have elevated this Flight to art.
B0051OZ564|3.0|Sucker punch was full of appealing &#34;eye candy.&#34;  The special effects were excellent.  The actual plot of the movies was not as thrilling as the dream scapes.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I have to agree with those that don't like the controls.  There's nothing more frustrating than controls that don't do what you want.  You want to more the cannon and it rotates instead.  Or, you want to rotate it and it moves up or down.  Very frustrating!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|We bought this because it was rated as one of the top 3 Disney movies ever made.  It is a great movie for a collection.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|You have to love P.G. Wodehouse, his writing is British humour at its best.  Fortunately he wrote a lot of material, so there is plenty to choose from.  The Jeeves stories are the best known, at least in the US but the stories around the Drones Club and Angler's Rest are just as good.
0553382179|5.0|I read this from the library and kept checking it out to refresh myself on her ideas.  I finally decided I needed to buy this...I am the queen of decluttering but I really felt this book was worth keeping.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this season. It was addictive and thought provoking left you wanting more. Loveable and hateable characters you will love it too
B0091REZMW|4.0|time killer and interesting to a point. a little tedious but fun. the in app purchases are yucky but patience will payoo
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This is different from some of her other recordings,but very enjoyable. I would like<br />to see more of her concerts put on dvd
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I'm not sure why I was so drawn to this movie, but I watched it on Amazon for a sale price, and eventually, I was able to pick it up for $20.  Disney blu rays/DVDs never get cheap, and Disney's terrible for limiting the duration of a movie's release on a home video format.  However, Disney pulls out all the stops when preparing and cleaning up prints of their movies for release.  The picture on this blu ray is absolutely stunning with its lushness, and although I tend to pay a little less attention to sound than I do picture, I couldn't help but notice how beautifully it played through my stereo system, as well.
B009NX409M|4.0|I gave this a four because you never know when or how you are going to find love. Decent acting too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The end of the book is very disappointing that there's no more district 12 :(  although it's a great book to read :)
B005KELQEU|5.0|I have a larger version of this sleeve for my tablet and was delighted to see that there was a smaller version too.  I know it's marketed for Kindle, but it fits a Kobo Glo perfectly as well.
B00846REIS|3.0|I really enjoy reading books just like this one equally as good as 50 shades of grey . I can't wait to get started on the next book and to the last it's one of them books I can't put down for vary long . I like that it is keeping me interested
B005NSRNDG|5.0|I never realised how many old Sun songs I knew until I heard this recording...and likewise, I never realised how very peculiarly characteristic that room sounds; it carries through, over the years and into high fidelity!  Isaak, despite putting out a fine catalogue of utterly never-decreasing-in-returns original material over the years, has--with &#34;Beyond the Sun&#34;--surely put out his finest recording ever.  (And his own songs on this record do blend in seamlessly.  God, his talent is staggering.)  The quality of even the vinyl itself is something to marvel at--very heavy, and plays perfectly and silently.  The musicianship of the band is amazing.  The room sounds eerie and excellent.  The technical work is sublime.  And...tonnes of liner notes!  SO much fun.<br /><br />I'm not one to proselytise...but this is probably the first record I have ever heard which has actually, seriously tempted me to buy about ten copies and just give them as random presents to my friends of taste--or even complete strangers.  There is so much material which so many people already know and love, and the quality and dedication shown on the entire project makes it all the more marvellous.  Chris Isaak is so wonderful for having put this project together, and for having pulled it off perfectly.  I love it!!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great DVD and CD's ....So much fun seeing Led Zeppelin<br />back together again...I heard Robert Plant say he wasn't<br />doing anything in 2014...so they might tour again
1936891026|5.0|This book was recommended by a very successful artist in Tallahassee, who was commissioned to create a series of sculptures. You just never know who you might meet! I am still reading, but have already begun to understand the blocks to my own creativity. I hope to move past time and mental limits to create some meaningful paintings on canvas.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|The last disk skips, and since I didn't watch until after return, no deal. Same thing with the Leverage Disk from Amazon LLC. I buying disks from Target from now on.
B002APS61I|5.0|I even own this DVD and enjoy watching it over and over. Great love story, good acting, good story line
B002EMESSM|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and I still like it, even though the costumes look dumb. This movie is still a must watch.
B00006IU73|5.0|In a world of ordinary, Porcupine Tree delivers! Great song writing, delicate and forceful orchestrations, intelligent lyrics and beautiful melodies.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|What can I say....it is Tommy Lee Jones, Meryl Streep, and Steve Carell!  The trailer made it look more comical that it was. Yes there were some comical moments, but for the most part there were serious and uncomfortable moments about how life takes you in different directions from someone you love and what loneliness you can have with someone in the room next to you.  I could feel Meryl Streep's emotions and hurt in the counseling scenes.  What a pairing with Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep...I wasn't sure it would work, but it was wonderful!  &#34;A must see&#34; as the guy who does narrates the trailer says!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book, very sad at sometimes but also very suspenseful.  I would suggest this book over many others.  I would also suggest Catching Fire and the Hunger Games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 brought with it some new twists and turns for the Granthams and the McCarleys as well as the staff!  I loved watching each episode unfold and I do appreciate how the writers end an episode so that you know that there is more drama yet to come, but don't leave you hanging (i.e. see the final episode).  From the final episode, it appears to me that Tom will get much closer to the Granthams going forward.  Can't wait to see Season 4!  Also watched this with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet with HDMI connected to my TV.  Excellent viewing experience!  Highly recommend this series as I think the Brits do drama series better than Hollywood!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had this app for less than a week, and I am all ready using it all the time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't think I would like this trilogy as much as I did, but it kept me on my toes!!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|DID NOT FIND IT A GOOD READ.I'VE BEEN CALLED SAME.BUT THAN AGAIN WHO IS A GOOD READ.I CAN'T READ SORRY
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show since it came out! So nice to watch nice clean soapy/drama. My whole family watches this together and everyone likes it!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great movie to watch with your daughter, especially mine since she loves sports!  I liked the old school behind the scenes of an old scout with a not so old daughter!
B002PZC8BM|5.0|No wonder this show has been such a Smash! never thought I would be laughing out loud at a murder investigation. Nice, Clean, yet suspenseful drama.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good piece of work.  It is chilling as to how real the movie portrayed the real events.  I lived through it, so I can say that!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|As a huge fan of the books, I was almost afraid to watch this. But it would be great entertainment even if you hadn't read the books. If you have, fair warning, this is more like the movies, where they focus on the action suggest and allow the viewers to figure things out. so much of the Character's personal backgrounds which creates that investment in them, is missing.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|My nieces and my wife were glued to the movie.  It still is very entertaining and half the fun is watching the kids watch it!
B0024F08RO|5.0|I love this series. It provides plenty of suspense with great acting and great characters. If you like drama I highly recommend this to you.
B009S33I68|5.0|Same as We are Soldiers Still. Very accurate to the real events of that Battle. Recommended reading to all who want to know the facts as they were.
B007712XAU|5.0|The cast , the locations, the story, and time period are all excellent.<br />I am English and lived during the 1930's.<br />It needs no recommendation, it is widely acclaimed.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is excellent and I had no problems at all viewing it on amazon. It was quick and easy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well produced and cast, superb set and costumes. DIVINE acting and Maggie Smith! What's not to love? WELL DONE PBS
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best albums I've heard in years. Its a great collaboration and the sound is awesome.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 21. What I liked most was the suspense. The joy she (Ana)<br />. Felt. What I didn't like was Nothing.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Cool game, actually quite scary.  It has a glitch that is super annoying though.  You just fall off map in random places.  It happens about every 4-5 games.  Please fix.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am now eliminating wheat totally from my diet and have never felt better. No more afternoon extreme tiredness, no more gassy stomach, bloated and uncomfortable feelings , no more passing wind to the extent of being an embarrassment.<br />I can not believe the change and improvement just from eliminating wheat.<br />I now use Kamut flour to make bread as the einkorn is not available where I live.<br />GREAT BOOK
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I haven't read any reviews of this film as of yet, but almost everyone that I have spoken to has offered pretty much the same feedback. Many believe that the first half hour, the \\"flight in the air\\" segment, is terrific; but the reactions of most people to the remainder of the film, i.e., the \\"flight on the ground\\" segment, range from \\"just O.K.\\" to \\"a snore,\\" with many people putting the blame on \\"the television-quality script.\\"<br /><br />Upon further questioning, I have found that what seems to bother people the most is their belief that, drunk or not drunk, high or not high, Whip Whitaker would have landed the aircraft successfully, so what's all the fuss about Whip being legally drunk while piloting the aircraft?<br /><br />It doesn't seem to help that many people are cognizant of the fact that many alcoholics and heavy drinkers eventually reach the point where almost no one can tell if they are drunk because they don't act drunk; and if they don't act drunk, then they are most likely not significantly impaired, or so goes the reasoning.  So people ask, \\"How does the film justify Whip going to jail?\\"<br /><br />I surmise they have some difficulty dealing with the ambiguity and the complexity of what is going on.  That it was illegal for Whip to be piloting an aircraft with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit just isn't enough reason to justify Whip going to jail.<br /><br />Interesting.  In real life would these same people be concerned if, for example, they found out that a person driving under the influence went unpunished because a court determined that the person was driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit but  was not significantly impaired?  Of course not. But evidently they can accept this in a film.  They can handle the ambiguity in real life but not in a film.<br /><br />(I loved the \\"flight in the air\\" segment, but didn't like the rest of the film, upon my first viewing.  But I felt compelled to figure out why I didn't like the remainder of the film, so I watched it again, and came up with the above. This helped place the remainder of the film into proper context.)
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I have read most of the Sigma books and love them all. Never a dull second. This one takes the reader from Washington DC to a cruise ship in Indonesia to Hagia Sophia and off to Cambodia for a heart stopping finale. Lots of thriller romance, but no overt sex. One of the things I really like. This author sticks to the action and doesn't throw in bedroom scenes. His heroes are tough, funny, and gentlemen.<br /><br />This is probably the goriest of the books I have read so far so if you have a weak stomach you might want to pass. Sometimes it verged on zombie fiction, but he pulled it off. Just a lot of blood and gross description of carnage. And more profanity than I've noticed before. R rated rather than PG 13 like the other books.<br /><br />All in all a real page turner, full of biology, medical speculation, and as always, weird facts. A great read.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|I had seen all of the Spider-Man movies at the theater and like to have these for my own collection. Item was received in good time and in new condition. No problems and will do again.
B008Y73940|5.0|Good movie based on a very good book.<br /><br />Interesting to see the ADA who later was the lead in the Grisham TV series - he is good (tv show was not).<br /><br />Worth watching.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|If im in trouble on minecraft an need a material i can mine or i can just go to inventory editor and get it easy.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season was great - I like Donna - funny and surprisingly good.  David Tennant - he's my favorite Doctor Who, I think.<br /><br />Episodes in this season were light, serious, and dark but always very enjoyable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I rated this because I liked the words that are in the story and the character kattniss is a realy awsome hero for this book.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Ridley Scott is tapped out, time to retire. I actually felt sorry for the actors; imagine how excited they were to get on board a film directed by The Famous Ridely Scott!  This film is evidence of how even good actors can't save a disastrous plot and helpless script.  It's too bad Mr. Scott didn't consult with me prior to making this epic dog pile.  This would've been my advice:<br /><br />1) DO NOT do another Alien movie!  That signature franchise is tapped out. Do something completely different. Surprise your audience, come up with some fresh ideas or new approaches to old themes.<br /><br />2) You HAD the basis for something interesting during the film's five minute opening. It was beautiful, stunning and mind-blowing imagery up until the moment when the dude drank the black goop then disintegrated in the water.<br /><br />3) Make spaceship interiors look like REAL spaceships!  Aliens #1 & #2 were much more believable, as were the sets for Battlestar Galactica or Firefly.  Try visiting the next closest thing we have to a spaceship with a large crew -- an aircraft carrier or, better yet, a submarine. Maybe watch Das Boot a couple of times, maybe you'll get an idea of what it's like to have 100 people living in a 300-ft long, 30-ft wide iron tube for months at a time.<br /><br />4) Never waste a character!  ALL characters are important, even if they're going to be killed off half-way through the film; they all have stories, give them real relationships with other crew members.  I'm reminded of the famous squad of Colonial Marines from Aliens #2 -- their performance as a unit made the whole movie work, they made it believable. Professionals doing their jobs right up until the very end, not a bunch of panty-wastes sitting around blubbering about the terrible alien monsters.<br /><br />I'll give this film a charitable 2-star rating for its stunning imagery and CGI.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Parts of the games are challenging and parts are easier. Highly  recommended for children and adults. You can play in teams too!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|While it took a couple of chapters to get into, once I did I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written, plenty of good food for thought..

B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  It is definitely great for the family and can be watched over and over again.
B007V65R54|5.0|I've been a fan of Nate Silver's writing from his days at Baseball Prospectus. He has a tendency to view events from a purely analytical and objective standpoint, which is refreshing in this day and age where everyone in sports and politics tends to have an angle to their analysis. This book is yet another objective and easy to read endeavor into the statistical world of Nate Silver.
B005LAII12|5.0|I love Mark Whalberg! This movie is hysterical... Wasn't sure how I felt about watching a movie with a teddy bear, but it was def well made.

B002DJSBMA|4.0|I bought this movie because a friend who committed suicide watched this several times the week before. I wanted to see if it had any significance. It's a movie you have to pay attention to and watch more then once.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! I live outside the USA.  I do not have access to satellite weather maps. Can't tell when a hurricane is coming my way. This app has all the info I need at my fingertips.  I am able to program in the cities where my kids live or where I am headed next...it's like magic...15 day forecast or satellite maps come up. It moves with a fingertip. You can choose further details and video for weather in other countries.<br />ALL for free!!!! I am in love!!!!  Really...none of this is available in Paradise.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My 4 month old say me draw a figure and then was enthralled when I proceeded to play the game with this drawing I juts made. And I made a little drawing of her that I had to go save. I can't wait until she gets a little old and we will come back to this game and reminisce.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the battle scene. I felt everything the death to the victory Suzanne Collins has outdone herself. I loved the book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had ordered the first two seasons on DVD 2 weeks before the Season 3 started.  This is probably the BEST TV series I have even seen.  I am now in the Downton Abbey cult and had to own Season 3 although I had seen it on TV already.  I have lent all three DVDs to many friends by now so we can all be ready for Season 4 when it starts January 2014!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very logical progression.  Lots of games which get progressively harder.  This is for those of you who use the right side of your brain.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|great book could not but it down. can not wait to read more books by Suzanne Collins. try it you will like it.

B009I2UH2W|1.0|I purchased this product about 45 days ago. Worked fine for the first 30 days. Then completely died about 5 days ago. Of course it died just outside of the return window.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this charger.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I ended up giving this as a gift for a family member; but I love this movie and have since I was little.  I guess I am going to have to buy it again.  I was sad giving it away.
B0099116AY|3.0|Having watched the theatre trailers for this film I was ready for a comedy.  It had a few giggles in it but mostly I, and a friend who watched it with me, were uncomfortable and depressed,despite the uplifting ending.  If I had expected a drama I might rate it higher.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were, as always, great but who cast Steve Carell?
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I enjoyed Something Borrowed so much that purchasing Something Blue was a no-brainer. The story seemed a little too far fetched for my liking and very predictable, though it was still a quick and somewhat enjoyable read. Based on recommendations from friends I may still purchase Baby Proof despite being less than thrilled with Something Blue.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show because it shows how humanity even at the brink of death still struggles for power. It's amazing.
B0031R5K8G|4.0|Reading this book was great fun and it is a perfect read for a quiet afternoon in a comfy chair
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow is book is a roller coaster ride! So many twists and turns I think I have whiplash! The moment that he told her 'I love you' was so profound. They will make it though stronger than either of them ever thought. Now I just have to wait in agony for the next book.....
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The new season is sick. They picked up a few months after season 2 left of it looks like. The maturity of the group is apparent. They are more confident in their tactics and ability do kill the walkers and they are basically just super dominant now. Watch it. It's cool.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show is great mix of elements from other shows like Outer Limits and X-Files.<br />I am very impressed with the character development and storyline is intriguing. Well done.
B008578PRK|2.0|Couldn't figure out what to watch at the time. Saw this because of the interesting trailer. To tell you the truth, I watched it and can't remember it. It was that good, if you catch my drift.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|We are so used to the men in our books being strong, that it took me a bit of time to find Pat's rhythm and feel something for him. But as soon as I did, I was rooting for him as strongly as the eagles fans rooted for their team! It's a book of struggle on a background of unending hope, of regular people facing irregular but more common than we realise struggles with mental health issues. And the ending is superb ... happy but in an entirely fitting and entirely plausible way.
B00BESCJII|4.0|My 16 year old daughter saw this movie & loved it, so I expected a typical movie for teenagers.  I watched this with my wife & we were both impressed with the adult-level situations and excellent plot.  We liked it so well we bought the DVD.
B00992CF6W|4.0|super fun game to build on i really just wish they would add redstone and all that other stuff. great game though. They should put every block in it. It would be a great final update.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I waited until the third season before deciding to watch this show.  It is done quite well and the acting is very good.
B006LSZECO|2.0|&#34;I want my five hours back!&#34; was uttered by my DIL.  And, after closing the book, I felt the same way.  I decided to read this due to its overwhelming popularity.  Ugh-o.  The beginning of this had me hooked and I could not put it down.  But, halfway through; horrid.  The writing turns choppy and then, the fact that this couple ends up together is just ridiculous. This was waaaaaaay overhyped by the media and at best, is a third rate book to read if you don't have any paint that is drying.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Positive - innovative use of theatercraft; the focussing on the dramatic moments in the tiresomely long tale; and the beautiful cinematography. Negative - lack of cohesiveness between the acting and the story they were trying to portray. If they have to present an outr&eacute; version of a well trodden classic the various parts better be brought together more coherently.

Maybe I don't appreciate the humor, but it was not great.  It will be on a back shelf until kids are much older, or until it just..... disappears.

B00797MB0O|2.0|My daughter and I rented this because we love Charlize Theron but this movie was just painful to watch. It is not funny and her character is very unlikeable. You just end up being annoyed with her and feeling sorry for everyone and everything she comes in contact with.

B005C5A66G|5.0|Machine Head - Unto the Locust (Audio CD)<br /><br />Four long years after the release of Machine Head's 2007 incredibly mindblowing, and groundbreaking epic heavy metal opus that was \\"The Blackening\\", the Bay Area veterans returned once again in 2011 to unleash their latest blistering, and epic heavy metal opus entitled \\"Unto the Locust\\". I have greatly anticipated this album after having heard the song \\"Locust\\" countless times on YouTube and Music Choice Metal prior to the album's release in September of 2011, and when I finally got it and listened to it in it's entirety, I was immediately blown away by the sheer brilliance and epicness that is contained and possessed within this masterpiece of an album. In all absolute fairness and seriousness, \\"Unto the Locust\\" is exactly a masterpiece from start to finish, and even though there are only seven tracks ranging from over 5 to 8 minutes, and the album clocks in at almost 49 minutes, they are definitely some of the most epic, bombastic, and groundbreaking seven tracks that you'll ever be blown away by, believe me, it is that awesome.<br /><br />Each song here on \\"Unto the Locust\\" has it's own identity, and they all achieve such a timeless quality, as well as keeping clear away from sounding influenced by all the current trends going on in metal today, and that's exactly what a band like Machine Head does. Each song flows ever so perfectly and flawlessly throughout the entire album. The musicianship courtesy of the band themselves is more tight, precise, and focused then ever before. Everyone is definitely on top of their game here. Robb Flynn delivers in my opinion his absolute best and most powerful and focused vocal performance ever thus far. His vocals are as angry, brutal, relentless, and downright powerful as ever before, and also melodic as well in all the correct places. The guitarwork is also very outstanding as well, as both Flynn and Phil Demmel are both on the exact same page together, dominating through each track with an unstoppable arsenal of fast, heavy, lethal, and crushing riffs and awesomely blistering solos that will leave you breathless in sheer amazement. The rhythm section is absolutely tight, heavy, and relentless, as bassist Adam Duce just punches you straight in the gut with every hit and strum of his bass, and of course Dave McClain is in top fine form throughout with his fast, ruthless, punishing, and pulse pounding double bass drumming guaranteed to beat you senseless and have you coming back for more. Like I mentioned before, everyone is in top form on this album.<br /><br />The songs:<br /><br />The album's opening track \\"I'Am Hell\\" (Sonata in C#)\\" is absolutely pure bliss, and a blistering way to kick things off. The song begins with the sound of a boys choir which later progresses into a devastating breakdown section backed up with harsh, monstrous growls that will crush the inside of your ribcage, and then the song lashes out into an all out viciously brutal, and unrelenting full-on thrashing assault with a barrage of massive, rapid fire riffs, relentless, slamming, driving double bass drumming, fast aggressive vocals, and blistering solos that erupts like wildfire and burns down everything in it's path. Next we have \\"Be Still and Know\\" which is highlighted by almost hypnotic finger tapping guitar harmonies, plus more mammoth, crushing riffs and blazing soloing, and rolling double bass patterns, as well as an incredibly massive, towering chorus that is just downright addicting and extremely memorable. Definitely another highlight for sure. We then arrive to the third track \\"Locust\\" which is the biggest highlight on the album for me, and the reason that I bought this album in the first place. This track begins with some clean yet dark and ominous guitar plucking, and then the song thrusts into a beatdown of teeth grinding, bone crushing, and chugging riffage, stiff and hefty pounding drums, plus extremely catchy moshable, anthemic choruses, and an epic, winding, wailing, and ear piercing solo section is also featured as well, and there is also a monstrous bone crushing breakdown near the end too.<br /><br />The fourth track \\"This Is the End\\" is another blistering gem that starts with a cool harmonic acoustic guitar intro before erupting into another bombastic thrashing attack on your senses. This song also features another memorable chorus as well. Track five \\"Darkness Within\\" is another huge standout as well as the slowest song on the album that features an excellent blend of acoustic and electric guitars , as well as awesome melodic vocals from Robb, a pair of epic, winding, shredding solos, and a powerful and uplifting chorus. Then we have \\"Pearls Before the Swine\\" which brings back the brutality and aggression with pounding bass lines, along with busy, chunky, churning, bruising riffage, aggressive vocals, hammering drums, plus a wicked, ripping, whammy-bar guitar solo from Demmel. Then finally, we arrive to the album's final track \\"Who We Are\\" which begins with a children's choir with some, acoustic guitars, marching militant like drum lines, and violin strings backing it up, and then shortly Robb's vocals and more heavier guitars both kick in, and then from that point on, the song just kicks you straight in the guts and pummels your senses with awesome crunching riffs, monster grooves, hefty double bass drumming, and more dual shredding solos to boot, and the song ends with the sound of the militant drum line and violin strings to finish things off.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />All in all, \\"Unto the Locust\\" is just an all around epic, blistering, bombastic, and brilliant modern heavy metal masterpiece, and it is also in my opinion Machine Head's best and most focused release thus far. It just attacks you with it's incredibly focused power, passion, and proficiency throughout, and it also proves that Machine Head can truly outdo themselves, as they have done with their previous two albums in 2003's \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" and 2007's \\"The Blackening\\", and especially here with \\"Unto the Locust\\", and not to mention, they definitely know how to show the majority of today's metalcore and deathcore bands exactly how real heavy metal is done. Bottom line, if you're a fan of Machine Head or metal music in general, then by all means, you must buy \\"Unto the Locust\\"...Strongly recommended!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!n epic, winding, wailing, and ear piercing solo section is also featured as well, and there is also a monstrous bone crushing breakdown near the end too.<br /><br />The fourth track \\"This Is the End\\" is another blistering gem that starts with a cool harmonic acoustic guitar intro before erupting into another bombastic thrashing attack on your senses.

B007QXU0ZO|4.0|This is a terrific band and I am hoping for more CD's and concerts in the future. The problem Edward will have is keeping all 10 to 11 band members happy! I particularily like Jade. Edward---come to Las Vegas!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book was fun, but not written for an older audience. I was disappointed because the reviews compared it to Game of Thrones... So fun, not what I thought it would be.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|A complex web of intrigue. Just when you thought the mind games were taking a break, the author throws in a totally unexpected twist. A real unexpected ending that makes the reader wonder what is real.
B008476HBM|5.0|My all time favourite book! Never gets old and can read it over and over again. Beats any modern day love story by miles.
B005I4JG80|5.0|We have a lot to learn from the French in terms of parenting. Like, how to help your baby sleep through the night, not be a picky eater or generally be a little a**hole, and how to maintain a full adult life of your own. By far the best parenting book I have read (I have a 3 month old). The storytelling. Is fantastic too, much more fun to read than the manual-type books I have read.

B00B2DSK06|4.0|My son is nine and absolutely loves this movie! Very entertaining which is good, because he has watched it repeatedly for a few days now :-) I enjoyed the mix of classic arcade game characters with the newer, more violent and &#34;grittier&#34; characters of  today. Great movie for curling up with the family and a bowl of popcorn. Similar themes to Toy Story, but still, fairly fresh, engaging material :-)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect but I really liked this movie. I wasn't familiar with the true story. It is long but moves quickly and keeps your attention.
B00B23O96A|1.0|The songs sound like country western and some even sound reggae. A few are all right but for the most part they all sound the same, boring with few solos and nothing truly musical about them. Terrible.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I've heard good things about it, but once I got into watching it I was quickly hooked.  I recommend giving at least the first episode or two a try.
B000008I4Z|5.0|I realize everyone has an opinion and their are haters out there for everything but come on one star, this is a great album. If I had to pick something to compare too I would say very Pink Floydish. I like Fish too but I like Steve H a ton too  (so as one reviewer said just shot me whydontyou) and what he brings to the table and the band is awesome. Mark Kelly and Steve Rothery are so good and awesome live  So stop hating and enjoy their music. Because there is very little new talent coming up and out. And all the bands from the 70's, 80's 90's just go on tour when their checking accounts are getting low and play the same ol singles and what people grew up on. Marillion is still putting out meaningful, emotional, very good music. This album is a bit heavier than Sounds that can't be Made which is fine with me but I like it all and love newest Sounds that Can't be Made&#34;. I think I even read 1 review/hater saying album is too long, how does a album be too long. Good to get moneys worth and should have recommened Genesis Genesis and the 9 pop songs on it that run about 29 minutes to that one. Once again stop hating and enjoy the awesome music this increditably underappreciated band creates

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I'm about halfway through this book and I still have no idea where it's going. It seems to be a series of seemingly unrelated storylines that are moving inexorably (and painfully slowly) toward some grand conclusion but page after page of somewhat nebulous meandering and backstory can be exhausting.

B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I love Kakuro and was thrilled when I saw it was now available for the Fire.  It works great (there are various levels -- and you can easily put in all possible options).  There is, however, one bug.  When you finish a game (particularly when it's one of the more complex games) and you click on &#34;next&#34; - some of the time it brings up the next game.  But many times it does not -- it sometimes goes back to the &#34;wallpaper&#34; screen and you can then click on the menu and click &#34;resume&#34; (you can see the next game slide by while you're doing this -- and then after you click &#34;resume&#34; the next game actually appears.  Other times when you click on &#34;next&#34; after completing a game, the screen goes black for a second or two and tells you your score is something like 12 - and it brings up the most basic game.  You can resume the more complex game by selecting &#34;start&#34; instead of &#34;resume&#34; - and select the level you want to play.  Besides this one irritating bug -- it's a great game!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I loved this movie has everyone you love to watch in an action movie. Doing everything they best. If I were going to complain about anything in this movie WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!!  It would be that it is sold at from belief that Van Damme would not kick Stallones butt. However this temporary halt to logic aside this movie is a great action movie and a classic. My advice watch this movie only if you love action, big guns, and men wearing less makeup than most of the women in the movie.
0307596885|3.0|I read these short stories twice to make sure I wasn't judging them off hand or too quickly. This is just a depressing read!  Comparing Munro with Mavis Gallant ( another Canadian-- but living in Paris most of her life) shows that there is almost \\"no comparison\\" between the two elderly short story writers.  Gallant has it all, I think.  ( Read  Gallant's \\"Paris Stories\\".)  Munro relies upon coincidence and very little character development.  This is not enough to rely upon.<br /><br />Reading one of Munro's stories at a time might be the best way to find this collection satisfying at all.

After I tuned and clocked it Im pushing 30fps on the wither 2 on ultra. Minor tweaks here and there and I'm sure I can get it higher but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Packaging was beautiful. Very little fan noise, but mine is also 15 feet away by my tv. Pretty impressed in the quality of this. I'm sure the 680 does better, but I didn't want to drop that amount of money right now.

B005IS565S|5.0|FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH is exactly the kind of band that should be noticed. They're also one of the very few bands that can refuse to add anything new to their sound and evolve, and yet still retain quality. AMERICAN CAPITALIST is the epitome of this theory. This album, to me, seems to follows a certain theme, like the album before this, WAR IS THE ANSWER, which was obviously war-themed. This album is themed around capitalism and money. There aren't as many jabs at capitalism as you would think, but that doesn't mean it's not prevalent in some areas, such as GENERATION DEAD (my favorite song on this album) and THE PRIDE, which boasts clever references to Mickey Mouse and The National Football League (NFL). The band even does well on the more radio-friendly tracks such as the somber REMEMBER EVERYTHING, which is also a huge highlight. The only two tracks I could really say are not up to par with the rest of the album are BACK FOR MORE and IF I FALL. Other than those two tracks, this album is a instant masterpiece, and is proof that bands can stay the same and still present just as high a reputation as their peers.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars

B000E0LB8G|5.0|... of keyboards was obviously limited to what the instrument makers of his era were offering, specifically what we today call fortepianos. Would Beethoven have chosen a modern concert grand piano if someone had built one for him? I suspect he would have, with his well-known taste for furor and clamor. But that question is moot. It's a fundamental notion of \\"historically informed performance practice\\" that a composer of Beethoven's genius would have crafted his music to exploit the distinctive qualities of any instrument for which he was composing, and that therefore the composer's sensibilities can best be expressed on such an original instrument. Keyboardist Steven Lubin carries that principal farther than most, using three different fortepianos to perform the five concertos and three sonatas on these recordings, replicas of Viennes instruments built by Anton Walter, Johan Fritz, and Conrad Graf. In fact, the fortepiano was evolving rapidly during Beethoven's lifetime; the first instrument, built in 1795, has a smaller keyboard and different pedals from the last, built just over a decade later.<br /><br />Anyone can see that the fortepiano is much smaller than the modern B&ouml;sendorfer. Two men can easily pick up and carry almost any fortepiano. It's far lighter also, since the frame is wood, whereas the modern piano has massive metal frame. That frame is required to handle the much greater steel string tension of the modern instrument. The strings of a fortepiano were similar to those of a harpsichord, thinner, less taut, often made of two metals, brass for the higher register, iron for the lower. Fortepianos of Beethoven's times had a range of five to six octave, whereas the modern concert grand usually sports seven-plus octaves, with treble strings crossing bass strings at an angle. The fortepiano had a simple single-action escapement, with a significantly shorter \\"fall\\" for its leather hammers, while the modern piano has a double-action escapement. The \\"sostenuto\\" pedal of the modern piano had not yet been invented. Indeed, many fortepianos had only a knee-pedal that shifted the action from double to single strings.<br /><br />Anyone can hear that the fortepiano was not as loud as the modern piano. Its sweet softness makes it delightful to hear in a chamber but \\"challenging\\" to hear in a vast concert hall. Remember, however, that when you enter the acoustic space of a CD, volume is controllable; if you crave thunder in your Beethoven, just twist the volume knob. Far more significant for musical interpretation are the differences in \\"touch\\" and \\"decay\\" between the fortepiano and the modern. Because of its simpler action, the touch of the fortepiano, as everybody acknowledges, is quicker and subtler, and capable of exquisitely delicate pianissimos. Because of the much faster decay and the nature of the strings, sforzando accents are more prominent on the fortepiano than on the modern, differing in timbre as well as in volume. Since the decay is rapid, the player can let the notes he touches fade without constant damping, which allows a shimmering overlap/interpenetration of successive chords. Paradoxically therefore, a player can pound out furious passages on a fortepiano with perhaps more expressive contrast than on a modern. Steven Lubin exploits the Sturm und Drang of the fortepiano very effectively on the two tempestuous sonatas - #8 and #17 - included on CD2.<br /><br />Because of the lighter, never-crossed strings and its overall lighter construction, the fortepiano produces a clearer pitch with each note, having far less sympathetic resonance. If you enjoy that roiling resonance of the modern grand, you'll probably spurn the clarity and transparency of the fortepiano. The modern piano is constructed to maintain the maximum uniformity of timbre from its lowest octave to its highest. That uniformity was either unattainable or undesired by fortepiano builders. There are audible differences between the timbres of theupper and lower registers of all three fortepianos used for this recording, and such variations of timbres can be exploited affectively. It seems self-evident that Beethoven would have heard such possibilities and incorporated them in his music.<br /><br />There's also the vexing issue of temperament. A fortepiano COULD be tuned to modern equal-temperament, but it wouldn't stay that way long. In fact, fortepianos require frequent tuning, especially if they're transported. That can be considered an advantage, sinec most serious fortepianists tune their instruments to a temperament closer to what was normal in Beethoven's era, a modified 6th-comma meantone, making the consonances sweeter and the dissonances sourer. The affective characteristics of different keys and tunings were still prominent in the music of the 18th Century ... and Beethoven was an 18th C composer! If I were to write a thesis instead of a brief review, I might title it \\"Beethoven Was A Humanist, Not A Romantic.\\" And that would open a barrel of nightcrawlers, wouldn't it?<br /><br />Steven Lubin plays the delicate passages of the Fifth Concerto with breath-taking poignancy. It's in those passages where the special virtues of the fortepiano are most obvious. But, as I said before, he also thunders bravely on the two sonatas and on the deliberately bumptious-roisterous passages that punctuate all of Beethoven's concertos. To my ears, the choice of the fortepiano over the modern is more effective on the Fourth and Fifth Concertos than on the earlier works. I would argue that Beethoven had come to understand the full expressive capabilities of his instrument in his later works, ironically at the time when his hearing began to fail.<br /><br />Lubin dominates these performances in interpretation. Conductor Christopher Hogwood is innately a conservative interpreter - that's not a flaw in performance of Beethoven! - and subordinates his orchestra to Lubin's fortepiano assiduously. But don't try to listen to these CDs in a room full of ambient noise! The dynamics range, as they should, from ineffable pianissimo to blustery forte. Hogwood's \\"authentic-instrument\\" orchestra, The Academy of Ancient Music, is impeccable in tuning and ensemble. It's a pleasure to hear the distinctly individual timbres of the inner instruments and lower voices, rather than the rumbling tumult of the larger modern orchestra, especially the muddy muddle that emerge from most home sound systems.<br /><br />Okay, have I sold this set yet? I don't get a rebate or commission, do I? Note that the price is right. Consider that these concertos, especially the Fourth and Fifth, are among the greatest compositions of musical history, of which no single performance can be ultimate and definitive. Even if you eventually disagree with me about the merits of original instrument performances, you can't fail to enjoy Lubin's delicacy and elegance, or Hogwood's restraint.r and lower registers of all three fortepianos used for this recording, and such variations of timbres can be exploited affectively.

B005OZE9SA|2.0|I purchased the Scarlett 2i2 to use with my MacBook and rokit 5 studio monitors. Im running OS 10.8 and do all my music production in ableton live 8. When the 2i2 works, it sounds great. However, if you plan on ever letting your computer go to sleep or watching YouTube, don't bother. Audio completely cuts out about half the time my computer wakes up, causing all my applications relying on the interface for audio to freeze and forcing me to restart the computer. YouTube and other video sites also seem to effect the device, causing audio to come out in a very choppy, crackling fashion. This also is only fixed by restarting. Focusrite tech support could only advise to download a new beta driver which solved no problems. Judging by the many positive reviews, the 2i2 must work for some people. But if you're running 10.8 and like to use sleep mode, I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere.

I did not watch the HBO series but my son talked me into buying the first season set and I have finished it and am now watching the second season. It makes me want to go back and re-read the books again.
B00849F82E|5.0|This is one of those books that judge you—you don't judge it. Masterful in it's insight and writing style, Chesterton's Orthodoxy will continue to stand as one of the great works of literature, let alone Christian thought.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|I received Osmos as the FAOTD and, after just one day of playing, deleted the app. I am a fan of stress-reducing games that have casual structure, no time limits, few if any penalties, and a relaxed pace of play. I thought for certain after reading the other reviews that Osmos would be a good choice for me, but I was disappointed. Many of its pros are as others have described; the graphics and ambient soundtrack are beautiful, and the concept of being an intergalactic mote is unique. However, I found that playing stressed me out. If you make just one single mistake, you &quot;die&quot; and have to start over again... and even at just level three I found it very difficult to avoid making that one fatal mistake. I also disliked the lack of responsiveness in the navigation but understand that I'm supposed to be a floating mote, so I'm not supposed to have a great deal of control, yet I'm expected to deftly navigate obstacles coming at me from all angles. In short, this game is portrayed as soothing but I found it to be far from it, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else who was looking to try it for that purpose.
B005LAII80|4.0|It is cool although simple theme. I also redeemed the online digital copy and download it into my PC and have it in my Vudu. It is awesome to watch on my LG Cinema smart HDTV.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Received it free, really fun to play. After playing for a couple hours I can't stop. I would still recommend even if I had to pay a few bucks for it.
1451648537|4.0|I bought this book for my son, and I bought a used book at a very good price.  It was in excellent condition, and my son really enjoyed it.  He's an admirer of his accomplishments.  This book had a very honest approach to all of his work and of some of his failings.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Great graphics, no ads, easy to play, tilt or touch screen. Great game for the kindle fire! Full game for free!
B00999DFP0|4.0|Could have been less priced but love Big Bang!
B0082SU98U|5.0|Wonderful book for children. Very uplifting. Not as too good to be true as the movie, it has a nice shot of reality.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy Last Pass on my computers, yet it doesn't come up to the same level on my Kindle. Maybe I simply haven't figured out how to use its differences as yet.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is perfect for me.  The layout is simple and clean.  It displays the information in an easy to read font size, with just what I want to know.  This app was an excellent choice for me.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is a very nice case for the price. It could use a spot for the pen other than that very Nice.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and is great on blu ray!  One I will watch over and over againe.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great plot (for those who pay attention) and understand the messages. Also great action and plenty of sci-fi elements. A classic.<br /><br />If you don't like the movie, then you probably misunderstood the plot or it went against your belief system. To each his/her own. In any case, I hope you have fun watching it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Played it for a while! Great fun! As soon as I finish this review, I'm heading right back to my buggy!<br />What a hoot!<br />Can't wait to get back to it but I seem to be held hostage by this review!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is easy on the eyes. The numbers are big enough for everyone's fingers so that it minimizes keying errors. Simple enough that I don't need to think about instructions. This is my favorite calculator app.
B007SGM084|5.0|Now that I finished reading all 3 book I feel lost... I need more went more... And most of all I want me a Christian Grey of my own... Love these books.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It plays loudly and clearly on my cell phone.  It is transferred to the cloud.  I have to take some time playing it sometimes, but I always find it.  I don't do music often.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many great recipes and creative ideas.  A great way to find and share information.<br />Everything you can imagine it's here. Can't wait to try all the recipes I've found.  Always inspired by all the great ideas!  My favorite Kindle app!
0061438294|5.0|This book was referred to me by more than one person. They commented on how great the book was. I just had to purchase it and add it to my reference guides.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|Bought the book for work.  While the lack of crazy Puritanical overtones was nice, the premise is completely unbelievable (not to mention explained with little-to-no-detail) and the plot is virtually non-existent.  I honestly don't understand how this is a bestselling series...nothing happens for the entire first book.  It's not even very romantic!  The writer's language use is better than Twilight by far (and the characters more likable), but despite that I enjoyed the Twilight series more...terrible as it was, at least something happened (and if we're using the lack of action in Twilight as a standard by which this book fails, you KNOW we're in trouble).<br /><br />Save yourself and read Hunger Games instead.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was easy to watch and download. Thank you Amazon. Loved buying a show this way. I will do it again
B009O36EO0|5.0|Pop, but mature.  Pop, but dark.  Pop, but moody.  Pop, but electronic.<br /><br />Loreen's voice is full of character and emotion.  She uplifts on &#34;Euphoria,&#34; and pulls you back down on &#34;Everytime.&#34;  &#34;Heal&#34; is a heaping helping of single-worthy tracks as well as the most consistent (and not-filler) album tracks I've heard in years.<br /><br />This is the sequel to &#34;Ray of Light&#34; Madonna should have recorded years ago...too bad she doesn't have a voice like Loreen.  This album is an import that is absolutely worth every penny.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I was amazed by the number of different formations! Several were definnitely a challenge! I really enjoyed the entire experience!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who doesn't love Downton Abbey?  I love this show and can watch it over and over again.  Would definitely recommend to everyone.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|GREAT
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|i thought it was a very entertaining read and i can not wait for the next one in the series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome! much better graphics than the first version. I just wish I have better reflexes,  I get killed pretty quickly. ;)
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best Rick Riordan book I've ever read! I've read all almost all of his books, and this is my favorite! I recommend this book to people who love action and mystery!:)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is the best of the temple run games yet! It has great graphics! Both of my kids love it!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|It took a while for my purchase to be processed, but after it shipped and arrived, perfect.  If you love Micheal Jackson, this movie is a delightful treat that will arrive in pristine condition.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I love the movie and I look forward to watching more films using Amazon.com as soon as they make the Instant Video app available to ANDROID PHONES!
B004VOBIE8|3.0|Cant move files even though there is an icon to move files. Not really worth it if you cant move files.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great. it is just like on the computer. trust me if you love minecraft on the Pc,  you will love the pocket edition.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Tremendo reloj, muy buena maquina, muy hermoso, es elegante, deportivo, formal e informal, materiales excelentes. los recomiendo al 100%. Una buena compra.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|addicting..................you will be hooked. I watched all 3 seasons in 2 weeks time. I loved it!!!! so darn good I cant say it enough and im rambling on cause they make you write 19 words.........how stupid but anyway its a great show
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|It was inevitable that I would see this.  I love me some Russell Crowe, like in a deliciously BIG way, and so I was always going to watch this film despite the fact that it looked rather silly.  I had hopes that it wouldn't be.<br /><br />It is, and not even in that campy fun kind of way.<br /><br />Outside of Crowe, the performances are atrocious.  RZA has one look (that of constipation) and he uses it to express every emotion under the sun.  Poor Lucy Lui.  I love this girl, but her acting skills have plummeted over the years and she, quite frankly, gets lost in the clutter of this film.  I was hoping for her to pull out a total `Kill Bill' kind of crazy awesomeness and yet she's just there.  The stars of the film, Rick Yune and Byron Mann are just horrid.  I understand that this was RZA's attempt to pay homage to the Kung-Fu movies he loves, but he needed to modernize this, and not just in a trashy way.  He failed to pull this one off.<br /><br />The effects are surprisingly good, especially the use of makeup, and Crowe is hilarious, channeling Jules Verne and frolicking with prostitutes (the scene where he's face down in a bathtub only to `poke' his finger at another girl and then get felt up by Liu was worth the price of admission here).<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is kind of a mess.  Not kind of; it is a complete mess with very little to redeem it.  The storyline is clich&eacute; and the production is tacky.  I hate saying this about a fill starring God himself, but I have to be honest.
B0007939NO|5.0|I was happy to find this film. It brought back so many fond memories and songs. Superb acting, singing and dancing
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Jon Bon Jovi is  in my opinion is the best singer of all time and his love of music shows. This is a true showcase of his talent and ability to sing. His voice is heavenly..
B00006DEF9|5.0|I have always enjoyed the dancing and singing performances of Gene Kelley. Mr. Kelley's movies have always been a relief from everyday chores.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Not the best movie but certainly not the worse. I mean come on, Elizabeth Shue is in it so of course its going to be pretty good. This is more of a thriller than Horror. No guts or anything graphic. Story line was enough to keep your interest.
B002KECK1G|4.0|I found this film compliments later version by giving a different time period for filming technique. Though provoking in today's climate.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game, but WHY isn't the free update that's available from the play store not on the amazon app store???  If you don't support what you sell,  I will stop buying from you.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I LOVE this movie every time I see it on tv but I love it even MORE when I can watch it ALL the way through WITHOUT commericals! This is a very beautiful and well written movie of another and even MORE interesting view point of a Cinderella story! It's a truly wonderful movie to have because I will watch it over and over again.
0345803507|5.0|Yow....good reading. Fast moving and fun. What a ride...love the characters and the writer did a good job! Bought all three.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|after installing and configuring it, i found that it would not open the second time around. so after maybe 6 or 7 times of frustrating reinstalling, i was about to unplug this and delegate it to the relics box.<br />then, just then, out of blue, after i read about it maybe having conflict with other macros program, i thought, let me uninstall my kensington expert mouse software and see what would happen. so i was mousing around, trying to locate the kensington's software, and found out that it's located in the system tray, ie, to the left of the flag icon on the lower right side of the computer screen.<br />lo and behold, i saw the powermate software icon there, clicked it and it opened.<br />now here is the key. i pin the powermate software on the taskbar. i have to click it once to activate it. it won't open the software right away. the key is to go to system tray and click on the  powermate icon there to open the software.<br />hope this tip helps others.
