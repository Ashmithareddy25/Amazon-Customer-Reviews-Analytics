B004TI5N38|5.0|He always holds my attention from the beginning to the end. I don't ever get tired of reading his books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked Dr Alexander's scientific approach when describing his near death experience. It caused me to begin to believe there is an after life for everyone that is filled with total and unconditional love. When a reader completes this book they will undoubtedly have a stronger sense of spirituality. I know I did!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I always enjoy reading his books. This one pulled me in and didn't let go. It really held my attention throughout.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|Have been using it for years, integrates with my PCs and other devices.  Good support, regular upgrades.  Very please with the program.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is great it's packed with so much usefully information. Michael really knows his stuff. If your into<br />Fitness you need to read this book and follow it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are nice for killing time. Not too difficult, not too easy. Some are better for getting points than others. The background music is boring,but hey, the app is free! 8-)
B005IQZB14|2.0|I found this book boring, repetitive and tedious.  It was chosen by my book club so it was a must read or I would have stopped reading it on or before half way along.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|the story was easy to follow, the music and singing is great, I can't wait to look at it again.....
B0091REZMW|3.0|Does have issues with start-up, and sometimes it freezes. the graphics are good and the game is good to play.  Doesn't seem to have an end and it's not a game that can be completed in one day.
0553582038|2.0|I found this book to be a slog, particularly compared to the prior books.  I've read some of the other, more positive, reviews that claim this book had to be this way as it is a set up for future books.  Baloney.  It really felt like Martin was simply filling space in many spots.  Some of the descriptions seemed to only be there to add heft to the book and did literally nothing to further the story.  Yes, all books have some of that, but this one seemed to have way too much.  I have not read the books beyond this one, but probably will on the off chance he gets back on track, but I think this is the book where he really starts to run out of steam.  Hard to pass on it given how great the first three are, but it is a slog.  It is a shame.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I never read the book but my fiance did. She said it strayed a lot from the book but she liked this story better.<br /><br />I though it was a very enjoyable movie and worth the $5 rental
B0087ITBT8|5.0|I Laughed when My Son took me to this Movie for My Birthday...He didn't ..But he's a Great Son to Appease his Mom..Barbra was Funny..Seth was too...Predictable Movie but cute..
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's a great movie. I love the extra discs you get. Amazon gave you the chance to preorder it, can't beat 27 bucks for a 40 some dollar movie combo pack. Shippings pretty good, got the movie a day or two before hand. Overall pretty pleased with amazon.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|She is such a talent. Haven't watched this yet but I'm sure it will be Great. Just went to her Concert in Feb. 2013 and going to her return Concert in October 2013 ..out of ALL the concerts we have been to in our life..This one ..THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE TOUR 2013 ...was the BEST..She is So Personable..
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A very detailed story. I like the idea of how the author has focused on survival of the fittest. But some scenes are very detailed , very eccentric! I had a tough time to finish this book. I give 2.5 star because of the hard work, research & the effort the author has put. I really don't get this book!! Enjoy reading if u are into castaways, animals, gory details of animal meat etc. I still think Pi survived because of his vivid imagination or love for his life.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|You have to watch this movie in 3D ..Unbelievable Graphics..we are spoiled with 3D in our own home now..Love Tecnology.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm only fourteen and would stay up until 4:00 in the morning and have to wake up the next day at six i regretted it everymorning but one night i was bored and came upon this app AND IT WORKS MIRACLES!!! Now I can easily be out by 9 or 10 o'clock i recommend this app very much!!!!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Title of post says it all.  I mean it was a major league POS.  Hands down biggest POS ever made.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a awesome game get it I love it its better than the first temple run i don't care it you don't love it cause I do
B005SCSL56|5.0|This is an amazing first book about two kids who get sucked up into a magical world. They must find a way back to there world and stay out of trouble. They go on a fantastic journey to get back home and make some friends along the way. Chris Colfer is a creative writer as well as a singer and actor. The grammar and mistakes he makes are overlooked when you read the story. He is very talented and I can't wait for the second book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and addicting I love it I play it all day every day you should get it ill bet you'll like it no I garonte you'll love it
1400067936|5.0|I found my way to Professor Taleb's writing and lectures (video) though a friend who would constantly reference Fooled by Randomness as we discussed various work (software engineering) and non-work (mostly political) topics. It took me a few years before I finally followed his advice and read Fooled by Randomness. In a nutshell.<br /><br />If only there were a Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the computer industry we'd all be better off! An industry awash with experts, geniuses, visionaries, deep thinkers, thought leaders, keepers-of-the-sacred-scrolls... more likely, self-aggrandizing delusional snake oil salesmen. If there was ever a trial and error (currently we call it \\"iteration\\") industry where a lucky few find random success it's the computer industry in general, the software business specifically. If you are a software engineering professional, please read this book.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this story probably 20 years ago or more precisely, it was read to me.  What I find fascinating is how my perception on the events has changed but not my opinion of the book. It is such a wonderful read that should have you considering what freedoms you would like to give up for \\"safety\\".
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Hey, that's my fish is a great app. It s the option to play with friends, computers or simply by yourself. The graphics are smooth, the gameplay is addicting, and ot does actually promote strategic mind play. However it does not take long to unlock all the available levels. Fantasy Flight Games will hopefully come out with an update that adds more levels. This is a great app for young ones. They will quickly catch on and enjoy the app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The only reason I chose to read this book was because the movie was so great.  I wouldn't have picked up this book if I never saw the movie.  I'm glad I found it, and I would give the book to anyone who is in a difficult situation or needs a good story to read that actually means something.<br /><br />  I'm extremely alike to Charlie, the 16 year-old boy (at the end of the book). Which is a typical answer from any fan, but it's true.  I am not a fan of realistic fiction, but this is the best book that I have ever found of this genre.<br /><br />  I hope to become an author someday like Charlie, but I still don't know what  I would write about.
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|I downloaded this app prior to taking my driving test just to &#34;practice&#34; my parking abilities. This app has nice smooth graphics and superb colors that make it an addicting app. I recommend this to anyone who wants. Greatto &#34;practice&#34; there parking abilities. This app has several cars and senerios that provide hours of nonstop parking fun. Dualcarbon will hopefully update this app so that more cars and more senerios are available for playing. It would be quite nice if they even came out with a sandbox mode where the player could drive round an area and park in different places and explore a unique town, city, or back roads.great app for those who have or will have their liscense.
B0053TMP24|5.0|When Uncle Jeff toots the smell is so terrible that the gods can smell it all the way in Mount Olympus!
B00933JL0A|4.0|Townsmen is an alright app. It flips the ordinary gameplay and adds a spin to it. This is a fun app, but it does get repetitive and you soon loose interest. It is very fun up to that point. It is a unique app that should test out. It is fun, graphics are nice, and the general gameplay is smooth.
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|There wasn't really an ending. They never told you what happened with the married girl, and that's what we were waiting for. Although, the story was interesting, it was just a story, not really a plot. It was the intent clearly, but it still bothered me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever made on Android buy it it's free anyway and you get updates so you don't get bored(you will never get bored anyway)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|..can u tell I think this game is awesomeness !!!<br />Lol<br />Seriously , I actually enjoy this game more than I thought I would<br /> :)
0307341550|5.0|I'm starting with a warning-dont read this book! Unless you plan to be up all night and all day. As with \\"gone girl\\" this is a stonking good read. Camille Preaker is a (middle if the road) journalist in Chicago. When a child's murder in her home town of Wind Gap starts to make news, Camille's editor sends her off to get the story since she knows the town, and it's people so well. But there are many reasons why Camille left Wind Gap - Camille's a cutter-emotional abuse from her Mom ( who she calls by her first name-no mommy dearest here) led her not just to cut herself, but to carve entire words into her flesh. Creepy? Ah we're just getting started. Her step-sister plays the sweet baby girl at home, but the \\" most popular\\" girl at school, and there is nothing she won't do to keep her status ( to tell the depths she stoops to would be a spoiler). The local Sheriff is overwhelmed and the State Cop sent to help is playing everyone - including Camille ( though she is using him too). I could not anticipate the ending if you'd paid me. I could not put this book down-despite many instances of \\" dear god that is twisted!\\" I had to see what would happen next. Who was the murderer? What really happened to Camille as a child? Would she get her story and finally become a \\"popular\\" girl?  And why does she call her Mom by her 1st name?? A terrific page turner.  I just got \\"dark places\\" via Amazon-trying to free up a weekend for a, I'm sure, another trip on the Flynn roller coaster
0393343405|5.0|This book tells a lively and absorbing story, balancing solid scholarhip with a graceful narrative style. Greenblatt weaves the story of Poggio Bracciolini with the story of Epicureanism, as transmitted to Western Europe through Lucretius's De Rerum Natura.  One is left with a profound appreciation of the explosive power of ideas to influence the course of history.  First rate.
B00129H7VS|4.0|terrific and vivid resolution<br />great  product.wished they would have offered pacific at same time in a bundle.<br />price went down after I bought mine.shame!!!!!!
082300659X|5.0|If you're just starting out, and have been disappointed by the quality of advice you've been getting, you need this book. It approaches art the way it used to be done: no gimmicks, just learning to see, applying techniques that are known to work. Why is that? Because Ms Aristides teaches you the way you'd have learned sitting next to Caravaggio, Titian, Vermeer, and other great masters.<br />The included DVD is great, and tells you more in 30 minutes than you'd learn in weeks from most 'How To' books. Anyone can draw ... if they learn how to sight angles, measure apparent sizes and constantly check for (and correct) mistakes. Filled with good examples from other artists as well as her own portfolio, this is a book that leaves you with genuine skills, not artist envy. For book snobs: this is also a damn well-made hardbound book, with classy binding and paper, not the usual trade paperback.
B0006J28KU|5.0|My heart still pounds in suspense each time I watch this movie masterpiece. Loved the interviews and behind-the-scenes special features on disc two. Extremely satisfied with this purchase.
0544002318|5.0|An excellent autobiographical book on ultramarathons, nutrition and life in general. His first hand accounts on the races he has participated and won are thrilling; his vegan philosophy is not preachy or judgmental, which makes it easier for those of us that love eating meat. He delves into his life story and how he thinks that shaped him, from his mother's ailment that left her unable to speak, let alone walk, to his stern father who would explain things away with a simple \\"Sometimes you just do things\\", to his yearning for the freedom that his seemingly carefree friends had.<br />I found this book to be very inspiring and entertaining. If you liked Born to Run, you'll love Eat & Run.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is a really fast and fun game to do.You will really enjoy the graphics and the sounds. Highly recommend
1475143389|5.0|Speaking as an experienced weightlifter, this book describes the best method of lowering body fat which is to build muscle. It contains a variety of worthwhile exercises as well as helpful information on supplements and nutrition.
B0055S348W|1.0|Requesting a refund for the three apps from Amazon. none of them work.very frustrating. they cannot find my wireless printer that is in the room. All information was provided. guess I will not be printing from the two devices mentioned here. I went to seek tech help and learned that those print apps are not good. I read the reviews. Please send refund. than you. Ada
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is my current favorite TV show and I appreciate Amazon providing it to Prime customers from Season 1 and commercial free.  It's a great show!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is a quick read.  Well-written without being overly verbose.  Good for when you're looking for somthing fairly light  (though the subject could be a bit rough for some).  and FYI - the movie stays close to the book.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I can not wait for number five to come out. This game I think might be coolest game for Kindle. Although I wish you could get diamonds easier and faster
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|To keep this short, the book is pretty much about human relations and that we are moving to a more connected world. Overall the book flows well, and keeps you wanting to know more, and worth the try of applying most of the principles. A bit disappointed that it seems the URL to the free newsletter is not in use anymore...<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to push themselves in business and life, and that in Essenes it all about people.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love that I can carry the works of Lovecraft and a couple history books, and more, on my phone.  The app works great for reading.  A phone, even with the bigger screens on new phones, is not perfect, but since you have your phone nearly 24/7, this is a great way to kill any down time you get hit with.<br /><br />The synch feature is great if you have a kindle.  When you load up a document you've also read on the Kindle, it offers to move you to the furthest page you've reached.  This is the one flaw, however.  If you load up the app to check your position and update to where you are on a Kindle, you can't back out of the app without losing your place.  There's no quit option, and the phone's equivalent of escape simply undoes the synch, then lets you quit.  You're required to continue reading, I guess.<br /><br />Still, the app is amazing, free, and is a gateway to a great many books which are also free, in addition to whatever you might buy.<br /><br />EDIT - Touch the text of the book to bring up the various menus and symbols, then hit the Kindle symbol in the upper left to exit the book without losing your place.  Not exactly intuitive, but it works.
B002R25THI|5.0|Still as suspenseful as ever. Students enjoyed the comparison between &#34;old&#34; suspense and new.  Liked the twists and turns throughout the movie..
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is one of the best hero games! There's just something about playing as Iron Man that keeps you playing and playing. The graphics and sounds are great. This is one you need to get!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Too have such joy and heartbreak within the same characters can be quiet difficult. Christina McKenna has recreated true events and woven them with fictional characters that come to life.  A very enjoyable read.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over.  I am a  big fan of Clint Eastwood and this is one of my favorite movies.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Great book if you like rock music and auto biographies. It's an easy and entertaining read. And I don't own any Manson albums.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Have loved this movie since I was a kid, such a classic fun tale about vampires, family, young love and difficult adolescence haha! RIP Corey Haim.
B00BOUL9DM|2.0|It doesn't save puzzles that have already been solved! I have to always start over and I don't like it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting read.  Easy read too.  Not too technical, but gives another view from a 'medical/scientific' viewpoint.  I will be meeting him personally at a conference later in May at A.R.E.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Reading this saga for over ten years, and its finally done. It was a great journey and will be missed.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|iv only started playing this game, and its very fun.<br />I wanted to watch the movies and never got to<br />it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful game...can't believe it is free!  I love it...tons to do and I have always wanted my own horse so this is a great alternative.  Highly it recommend it to one and all!
B00B6DTIGW|5.0|this is a really scary movie, must see worth every penny. lots of suspence and jumpy parts. recommended to all.scary movie lovers
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's a fun game, but like the rest of the games like this, it will eventually burn you out when you can't play it unless you use real money. I'm not using money to play a game on my phone.
B00005LMBK|2.0|I had bought this CD after hearing just a sampleing from one of the song's & after listening to the whole CD found it just wasn't one I'd want to listen to again.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|This is really sweet techno pop WITH the added bonus of meaningful lyrics.  Any fan of Britney's production value who would also enjoy more substance should buy this album RIGHT MEOW!!  It might actually be unfair to bring Britney into the picture, since Charli's music seems way more mature than Britney's music even today.  Charli is like... if Lily Allen and David Guetta had a baby who then read up on Plato and Aristotle.  Meaning Charli seems really smart.  Meaning, please call me Charli!!  Please??  :)
B000002LJW|5.0|I feel this album has been very under rated as far as Clapton go's. One of my personal favorite's from him.
0785814531|5.0|My daughter loves her Kindle, but sometimes she likes the feel and weight of a book between her fingertips. She is now into Edgar Allan Poe works and while I could have paid about 10% of the price via kindle, it was worth the extra $$ to see her smile. This book is HUGE but it hasn't stopped her from lugging it around to school everyday. She got soo excited receiving this book, that she cried with joy!For those of you that enjoy Poe's works, this should become a main staple to your library. Thank you Amazon for always having the best prices and service - bar none. [[ASIN:0785814531 Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems]]
B00004W3L3|3.0|I had bought this because I liked the 1 song that I remember being a hit back in the 80's & although I do still like that song, I find the rest of the album ok at best.
B003VANOFY|5.0|i've been using them for more than a month now i think they are pretty good, good sound and nice design. and the battery life is very good too
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game is fun if u know how to move money and build buedness its s fun game to play
B00BYH6MZK|5.0|Great Movie!! Watch it. It is full of action and a very good plot. Very Entertaining and Exciting, Everything an action movie should be.
B004A7OQKY|4.0|&#34;Of course you are holding in those abs,&#34; she reminds gently and with a smile. Erin O'Brien makes the ideal fitness coach for pregnant women wanting to work out in the comfort of their own homes. All you need is a couch, chair and a wall to do this simple but effective workout. Erin understands the needs and concerns of pregnant women, reminding you of important health tips, taking water and bathroom breaks, and offering encouragement and realism. She even seems a little affected by the workout, but reminds us that &#34;you're okay!&#34; as we push through the tough parts.<br /><br />For a super fit, early pregnancy mom, this may not be very strenuous, but for someone advanced in pregnancy or a bit off track on fitness, the workout can be altered to be possible and helpful.<br /><br />This is not the fanciest production or the most modern music, and if you hate yoga or pilates or strength training, stay away. But if you want a simple, effective and rejuvenating workout with an encouraging coach, try it out!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Great Movie!! Watch it. It is full of action and a very good plot. Very Entertaining and Exciting, Everything an action movie should be.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I gotta think on the ending for a while. I'm not sure I liked the finale. Makes it more of a chick book.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|Really easy to use app. Great for bidding and watching your items. Recommended for anyone who uses ebay for anything.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I was a little worried whether or not they could do it.  Their last album was so good and so recent, I worried about the quality.  On top of that, they got a new guitarist - a very good one.  I was afraid that the amount of technical proficiency of said new guitarist would take away some of Volbeat's uniqueness.  And to top off my worries, the band has gotten quite a bit of commercial success in the ol' U.S of A.  That can break a band.  Many bands get that one hit single and their next album goes down the drain.<br /><br />I was wrong.  All above suspicions were horribly incorrect, and I'm glad about that.<br /><br />The song-writing is as strong as ever.  The avaunt-guarde, banjo-picking and thrash bits from the precursor to this album are amped up even more.  There's even a male/female duet on the awesome \\"Lonesome Rider\\".  I think the singer has improved, as if that were possible.  His range is so strong here, and the musicianship is great.  Oh, that's right: musicianship.  Now, that band has become more technical.  There are more solos, more time changes, parts that are just harder to play, but they don't overdo it.  And the chemistry between the guitarists is great.  There are lots of harmonizing leads.  The frontman gives the new axe-man a break and plays his more simplistic guitar parts with that beautiful tone Volbeat is known for (see the bridges on Heaven nor Hell if you don't know what I'm talking about).  The rhythm section remains awesome as usual.  So no worries there.<br /><br />My favorites on Beyond Hell Above Heaven were the ones that didn't play it safe.  Well, this album has maybe two or three songs that are single-worthy.  And those, to me, are still pretty awesome.  And there are two tracks that, to me, sound much like others from the last album.  Those are about the only negative things I can say about this album, although those really aren't bad things depending on how you look at it.  Because this album delivers the goods baby.  I decided to break this album in the right way.  My wife and I were taking a road trip to our hometown, and we listened to half of it on the way there, and the other half on the way back.<br /><br />We love it.  The album simply rules.  There is so much variety, yet the album holds up so well simply because the song-writing and musicianship are both so good.  The band is still experimenting and evolving it's rockabilly and country-inspired hard-rock / metal sound.  They are still having fun with making music, and man oh man does this music sound great on the road.  Good luck driving the speed limit listening to this one.<br /><br />My personal favorites so far are Pearl Hart, Room 24 (an awesome count from the singer's experience with sleep paralysis), and Lonesome Rider.  But really, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There are only three or four tracks that don't blow my pants off, and even those are far better than the majority of other songs I've heard lately.  On my little personal scale, this album trumps even the last one and is currently holding a boxing match with Rebel/Devil right now.  One more thing - the guest appearances on this album are all worth it!  Yes, it's that good.  Get it.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I purchased this as a gift and the friend just loved the disc.<br />they were really happy that I turned them on to this group.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great movie. Johnny Depp does a great job with this.  I watched this soap opera a a kid.  We had to get our chores finished before we could watch.  I wasn't funny then but the movie was and they still cought the characters.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I can't figure out how to erase items from my board or change interests.  Program and directions are hard to find.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I've seen this movie about 4 times, and still it holds my attention from start to finish. Who says you have to have crazy action scenes, or a lot of big stars, to make a great movie?
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|Though I wasn't as impressed by the movie as I thought I would be, it was exactly what I ordered.
B0017HEX76|5.0|This dvd is Korean and when I realized that I had ordered the Korean dvd  I got a little worried that it would not be as good dvd as the American dvd's. Lo and Behold it is a wonderful dvd clear and then Fantasia is just such a beautiful show. I love the fairy and the mythology wow! It's just beautiful, fantastic, wonderful and imaginative. I feel the money was extremely well spent. YAY!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The movie wasn't what I expected, but my family really enjoyed it.  It was nice to see the prequel to the Lord of the Rings.  We're looking forward to the next movies in the series.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|What's to say, if you are gonna tweet, you need this. Works like it should! Great way to stay in touch with the kids in college.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hard to put down--so real in our day of so much abuse and trouble.  It was heartwarming to see a good ending, not always that way in real life.
0399157565|1.0|OK; I tried again. I had promised myself several years ago I would never read another Cornwell book again. But I did, and I wasted several hours of my time trying to get through this one. BONE BED is terrible. There are pages and pages of filler, the story moves slower than a snail's pace and the main characters are annoying and un-likeable. I finally just skipped to the last 2-3 chapters and it ended just like most of the others; Kay kidnapped by some character and Lucy to the rescue.<br /><br />This is really it. Cornwell has sold out and gotten lazy. She needs to either take stock of her writing, or give it up completely.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like Bosh. This is very classical, nothing really surprising. But good neverthelss. Other characters are good too. Liked it
B000002QWD|5.0|Nothing like Christmas with Bing Crosby!  Brings you back to the times when life was simple, yet joyful, and you can't beat the voice of Bing Crosby.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It is very good for the price and fairly effective but it is made for very small blades or knives so don't think that it'll get ur kitchen knives perfectly sharp. It doesn't seem to be built for that.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries fulfilled all my expectations at an unbeatable price.  I would definitely buy them again the next time I need these batteries.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|I love John Grisham and this is just another of his fantastic books that sucks you in from the first page
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I installed it to be able to borrow books as a prime member. Found out that only kindles will allow borrowing. Not what I was told by Amazon customer service
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I don't understand these camera apps for the Kindle.  Why do you need this?  These is a camera app installed from the factory on the Kindle 8.5 and it works just fine.  I do think it sucks that Kindle did not put a camera on the other side of the tablet.  Hard to take a picture of something when you can't see it on the screen without looking around the corner of the pad.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is fantastic and the fact that it is free only makes it better. If you are looking for a fun time killer then this is the game for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's very much worth the $6.99 but only 1 thing WHERE ARE CAVES!!!! CAVES would make mining SOOOOO Much easier so please add CAVES if Jeb is working on this game right now I honor your work so please add caves.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|it is very entertaining game for young kids but the app has frozen and stopped working twice already. this has upset my daughter very much since she lost many &quot;pets&quot; already.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|A very complete and captivating account of something I knew little about. The political lead up from WWII and fallout and connection to Vietnam put it all together.  I'm reading The best and the brightest next.
B006FE83UE|5.0|A must read, must see for everyone.  Arrived in perfect condition and as described.  Super collector's edition for the classic movie lover's library.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app. The four people who said it sucks go and kick rocks because this app is awesome. Great quality for a dollar.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|This is in my top five favorite SF books of all time.  I could not believe my good luck when they released for the Kindle.<br /><br />Everyone that has an interest in ecology, ethics, and anti heroes should read this book.<br /><br />Hopefully, Mr. Martin will someday grace us with more &#34;Tuf &#34; stories.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|A great movie with spectacular scenes and fabulous story line.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes syfi!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|GREAT COMEDIC WRITING AND DELIVERY.  A WONDERFUL ENSEMBLE OF CHARACTERS, AND LOADS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENTS.  IT JUST GETS BETTER EACH SEASON
B009IEXKXI|4.0|As an astronaut wanabe I felt like I was there solving the problems right along side of him. Some interesting adventure
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I have long held interest in knots and tying. This book is the beginning of a new chapter in that interest. I see many late nights in my future.
B00CBBXOQ8|5.0|Olly Murs energy is infectious. His songs are filled with joy and true feeling. Frankly, I am surprised that he is not more popular in America. Great songs, great voice, fun times. Win.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is full of surprises! definitely shed a few tears reading it. Loved it and would recommend it to everyone

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway suffer could be better but is great to be a free game I don't like the fact that you have to buy coins and how some characters are high priced
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Travis Fimmel does  a wonderful treatment of his character. His sly smile and liting quality of his line delivery is very unigue.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|It's been awhile since I've found a truly captivating thriller. A couple of scenes are a bit too intense and some of the plot twists require a stretch of the imagination, this is great entertainment and a quality thriller that will stand the test of time.
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|If you like to see people hurt each other (and shoot dogs) by all means watch this thing.  Just one of many unforgivable scenes showed one young man deliberately shoot himself even though he knows his friend is coming to his aid and will be the one to discover the body (and suffer the rest of his life for being too late).  This movie isn't just bad, it is sick.  I bought it as a download and deleted it from my computer.  Just...Ugh!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game. I like the new save me keys really cool addition to the game. I really recommend it.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|A good movie.<br /><br />The tsunami and underwater effects were great.<br />The acting was great too with Ewan and Naomi<br /><br />Although a true story, some elements were changed.<br />The family reuniting back at the hospital might have been a little contrived
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app..don't usually have problems..just freezes but only happened onnce to me..can't complain when it's free. It's one of my favorite things to play.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Lots of explicit sex and it does get a bit tiresome by the second book.  But  initially I found it absorbing.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game helps your brain think a little bit. This game is really fun, I like it. This game will be fun for the whole family.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game is wonderful though it does not last long. I really enjoy games that are challenging and mind bending. I would be more than happy to recommend this game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wow the plot twists in this book is crazy, so much change happens in Westwood so fast I had to reread parts just to make sure I read it right
0307913090|5.0|Love the book, I purchased the audio version and the narrator was excellent!!  Highly recommend.  Martin is a fantastic story teller.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like the game. Though I don't like the Facebook, Twitter, Subscriptions, etc. That is just :-(. Also, there is high prices for invest points. :-( :-)
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I enjoyed the images and way the puzzles are done, but the game was a bit too short.  Nevertheless, a very interesting (and very beautiful) take on a &#34;jigsaw&#34; puzzle.  If you like jigsaws and puzzles, try this one and enjoy the clever take on an old theme.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I personaly think that the game is the best movie and game ever in history of iron man ever just the graphics need to be a little better
B006LSZECO|4.0|Scary that there are people like this living in the world. Too real for my liking, but kept me reading
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is an outstanding cookbook that happens to be vegetarian. The recipes are very accessible, and they range from the simple-but-brilliant to the complex-and-utterly-satisfying. I am not a vegetarian, but I always want to find wonderful new ways to integrate more vegetables into my diet, and, as a passionate cook and foodie, Plenty is an ideal way in which to do that. I highly recommend it.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This is another awesome album by a band that just keeps getting better. Although I love Slipknot, this band is more creative.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Claire Danes is an outstanding actress.  She has won awards for her major roles on TV, such as Temple Brandon and Homeland.  But this came earlier, and I can't think of a better way to introduce the little girls in  my life when it comes time for them to deal with teen age issues including sexuality.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|lots of fun keeps u thinking. cant wait for part two will update as soon as I can good job guys
B000H7JCIW|3.0|We owned the original video for many years. The quality of picture seems to have lost something in this copy process. Nevertheless, we will enjoy many times.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I LOVE this game it is so much fun and its a nice game to pass the time,me and my friends are big fans of iron man and I can't wait to tell them about it! Love it! It a fun game and is a lot like temple run except it iron man style! good work keep it coming!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Usually I'm a big fan of Seth macfarlane and mark wahlberg but this movie was weird and awkward and lacked depth from the initial scenes.  Mila kunis didn't even share any gratuitous leading lady skin shots.  Don't waste your time and money into this one.
B00C4QE04K|5.0|This was a very good movie, with Depp in a different kind of role same goes for the rest of the cast.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book .one of those books you will remember forever. It will make you laugh, cry and  completely understand  both viewpoints
B002RI9X8S|5.0|'The Grapes of Wrath' is indeed a classic. The themes are timeless and biblical in breadth and held my attention from start to finish (and what a finish!). Steinbeck captures the human condition in all it's generosity and abject selfishness with great sympathy and insight. The Joad family takes form and emerges out of the earth itself, the searing, wind driven dust bowl of the Oklahoma panhandle, and despite the ravages of their journey, or maybe because of them, grow in kindness and decency in inverse proportion to their poverty. But there are multiple 'levels' to be explored in this book, all still relevant today, which is of course a measure of it's genius.
B008M0UTRO|4.0|A well produced anime which captures this particular era in Japan from the view of adolescent high schoolers and reinforces traditional values of that time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this app on my ipod and its my favorite game ever. I love it more than temple run because I like how its not motion sensitive since I play my apps mostly in the car lol
B00116GHMM|5.0|Despite MGMT hitting radio popularity with their single &#34;Kids&#34;, they remain true to their psych rock style, delivering a solid album I would recommend to anyone you enjoys artists anywhere from Animal Collective to Arcade Fire.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|It's Mumford and Sons. What else need I say? Wonderful. The songs rock, the passions sizzles, and the instrumentation is dazzling.
B0006IEVFG|5.0|i was very pleased with this product. it was very very very very very useful.....until,of course, the sun went down. STUPID SOLAR POWER!<br /><br />update: i waited all night for the sun to come up and finally,like a pop-tart rising gracefully from the toaster,the sun arose. i lifted my wrist-watch up and screamed\\"by the power of grey-scull!\\" i was so happy as my watch came back to life!<br /><br />update: it has been two weeks and my watch has not run out of energy once. of course i did get a job that requires me to follow the sun constantly so i have no problem with charging it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is a very unique game. nothing is really like it:). (in my opinion) it is more fun than temple run and keeps me entertained for long periods of time. :) I will give this game five stars because it is worth it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Good game. Sisters breathing down my shoulder waching! Wish I could get coins faster. But was very cool.like the game templerun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my favorite series and I have read it many times. The plot is great with all of the twists and turns it takes. I also love how the author makes up this whole other world in place of how it is now. This book is great on the kindle because you don't have to worry about losing your place or wrinkling a page. Over all, this purchase will pay off.
1449410243|5.0|i laughed out loud many times whilst reading it.  am required to use more words but i have nothing else to say.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Loved this movie, it was very beautiful the way that it was made. It was hard to tell the real from the animated.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its very cool and worth 6.99.The only thing I want is it to have the same as on the Pc or xbox.other wise I recommend it to every one. I play it for a long time its addicting.
0553801473|5.0|That's what reading reviews on Amazon can do to you... I had been enjoying with strong enthusiasm the serie up to the fourth where I started struggling with lesser characters, too much of Cercei and a lack of the more interesting ones. Then I started checking about it on Amazon and a very good review started to give me doubts. It stated that the serie was very unlikely to end due to the very slow pace of writing of Mr Martin. As I was tired by my reading of the fourth, I did put the reading of the fifth on standby.<br />What a mistake!<br />In fact, \\"A dance with Dragons\\" fits in the serie perfectly well. I won't spoil anything which means I won't say much by consequence about the story. Enough to say that Jon, Tyrion, Daenarys, Arya are here again. There are many very nice moments where my heart started beating faster.<br />Let me assume that you have read up to the end of the fourth at this stage. I will state that \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is the complement of the fourth as books intended to set the stage properly before continuing with the story.<br />I do personally like the writing style of Mr Martin so I won't complain about him taking too long. I guess it is a question of taste, if you want a fast paced serie, this one may not be for you. I do enjoy when the story stretches, specifically when the characters are interesting. It creates a kind of intimacy for me with them.<br />Do not get fooled by believing that nothing happens in the book. The story develops itself in many different directions, some kind of expected and some absolutely not foreseen by me.<br />If my memory is correct and if there have not been any updates since the last time I checked, the six one is supposed to be a few years after the end of the fifth. I am impatientely waiting for it, I am still afraid it may take the author as many years to write the next book than for this one. This means five years!!! Hopefully, HBO's interest may lead him to increase his pace but I am just speculating.<br />Conclusion:<br />If you have come up to the fifth book of the serie, you cannot be anything else but a fan. Or you like torturing yourself... Anyway, if you were disappointed by the fourth and its lack of really interesting characters, this one will restore your enthousiasm. Good reading!r />Conclusion:<br />If you have come up to the fifth book of the serie, you cannot be anything else but a fan. Or you like torturing yourself...

B00B7PIRIE|4.0|The DVD's arrived in a package that was ripped open at the top and looked like it had been through a grinder.  The DVD cases were cracked and broken but I doubt all that damage could have come from shipping as it looked like the plastic container was very cheaply made and the DVD's don't even stay in place inside it.  The plastic container does not stay shut so I have to keep them wrapped up with a rubber band to keep them from falling out.  The DVD itself was in good condition despite being loose inside the outer plastic cover.  I will try to find another DVD holder for all of them to keep them from being damaged.<br /><br />This series is one of the best I have ever seen and I can't wait for season 4!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Not the best.  Worked for a month and broke.<br />I would just buy the brand you need and not this.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Its a fun game but if you don't want to spend real cash you run out of things to do while waiting for more money
B0046ECJBY|3.0|Ignore Henry's ego trip, his hagiographic defense of Richard Nixon, and the untruth that the US &#34;opened China&#34;  and you can learn some things.
6305212112|5.0|I love the movie. They matched the actors perfectly with the characters, and the music is beautiful. It's the perfect summertime movie that you love all year round.
B009POCG2C|4.0|A beautiful story of a dad and 30+ year old daughter, their awkward relationship and a deep passion for baseball.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to relate to their relationship. Eastwood and Amy Adams did a great job presenting a dad who wanted the best for his daughter and in so doing neglected her as she grew up. She responded by becoming a high achieving lawyer so she could be accepted and loved by her dad.<br /><br />The awkwardness of an elderly dad, unable to demonstrate how much he loves his daughter, and yet so whats too. A daughter who just wants to be loved by her dad. And then there is baseball.<br /><br />He, the talent scout who instinctively sizes up quality targets, and she who has unbeknownst to both of them developed the same attribute due to the many hours they've spent together watching the game.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake does a good job too. He's definitely improving as an actor.<br /><br />A little slow but one definitely worth watching even if you're not into baseball.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't say enough about this show. I just absolutly LOVE it. So entertaining! I love the old setting and the plots and characters are perfect. i could watch all day!ha
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Positive content and good performance of both leading actors and supporting roles. Could be a little shorter though. Definitely worth the purchase!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I didn't get to watch this but my daughter did and she loved it.  So glad Amazon had it  available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing I can get cool boards and cool people to run with u could also play on FACEBOOK. YEAH BUDDY
B000URWYTS|5.0|Thought this is a fictional account, it inspired me to learn more about this famous architect. It is amazing that this love affair survived. A quick interesting read.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Our book discussion group just finished this book, which I had thoroughly enjoyed. Much to my surprise, some of the book cub members did not like this book because they found it depressing. They volunteered that the book was very well written, the characters were well-drawn and well-developed, the story was not trite but rather had a number of novel elements, the story was distinctive. My guess is that, as Americans, we are drawn to lighter stories or at least stories that do not have a noticeable portion of situations in which characters struggle or suffer. So, for readers who like lighter fare, be forewarned that this story's protagonist suffers; much of his story (though not by any means all) is sad in a way that touches the reader. I rate it with 4 out of 5 stars because it was so well written and told such a unique story. My only hesitation for 5 stars is that, in the light of this story being fiction, the author could have interjected just a bit of humanity in the characters of the protagonist's youth; the unrelenting horror in the protagonist's formative years was a bit over the top, even if the author's research found it to be representative of the times and conditions.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Mostly good app. One major problem though is it at the very upper limits of the Kindle Fire's processing ability.  So it can crash on rare occasions.  Even still, mostly good.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I bought this to navigate around in solidworks. this works great for 3d model building on the computer. and a added surprise that it works in goggle earth also.
B004P7CNUY|5.0|dvd came in as desribed
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you love iron man you will love this game. It has an extra download but it is worth it.
B003DWG29A|3.0|I think this film was going somewhere but didn't get there.<br />3 stars for the action, but the black and white was not conveying the mood.
0307950689|5.0|The book was great. I am a fan of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series. Always well written. They are usually fast paced and exciting enough to keep my attention. And the lost symbol may be one of his best books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Mr. Alexander does a very good job of explaining how and why he had his near death experience and just how close he was to death. He deftly brings us into his family and professional lives. It is amazing that he lived to tell his story and being a brain surgeon he is the perfect person to have this experience and live to tell about it. The book should give everyone confidence that life continues after our bodies stop working.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Unfortunately, I read the book before seeing the movie & was so disappointed in the characters. They just didn't live up to their counterparts in the book. The acting is unconvincing & contrived.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I find this app very useful when accessing my work emails on the go from the Kindle Fire. Though I do wish it would just automatically open the documents and not have an extra step where I have to pick the Adobe app as my preferred app each time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is fantastic because like the first one, it shows that when you get faster, it gets more complicated.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I read the series because I heard it was good. How wrong they were. It was very depressing. I will never read it again.
B0055OG2BC|3.0|enjoyed seeing the legendary actors in the film.  Dumb movie, but I left my brain elsewhere. worth watching once or twice.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Am enjoying the book as I read it. It is an eye opener to how things really are in DC.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game way better than temple run. It is fun and challenging, not to mention free! A must get.
1609421019|4.0|I had hoped the flat blue picture of this volume on the Amazon website was an error and it was really part of the Overlook Press set of Wodehouse books. I'm collecting those. But the publisher is otherwise and the picture is faithful to the monochrome cloth cover. The volume has no dust jacket. It's an okay book, but I gave my copy away and will replace it with the Overlook edition when it's available.<br /><br />Naturally, the story is good (see the dramatization on disc 2 of the first season of the Fry/Laurie \\"Jeeves & Wooster\\" series). Bertie is a bit out of sorts in it -- a little envious of the attention Jeeves gets for his schemes -- and to me doesn't come off as the lovable idiot he is in a lot of the other stories. An idiot, still, but with an unfamiliar edge. If you're just looking for another Jeeves story to read and haven't read \\"The Code of the Woosters,\\" I'd recommend that one over this. That story is also on a disc from the first season of the TV series.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It was an amzing app but one day my baby brother deleted it and i got sad so i tried getting it back but it wont download. i tried turning my device off and then back on. i miss this game it was awesome.
1440503257|5.0|The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook was exactly what I was hoping for - a very practical British cookbook with lots of receipies I want to try including meat pies, desserts & much more. This is a cookbook that can be used for every day cooking & not just fun occassions like parties.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Yet again another excellent book from Suzanne Collins.  I truly enjoyed the last book in the Hunger Games Series..Like the 1st 2 books the 3rd book had me glued from the start. I only wish there was more..Bravo
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a good mix of entertainment. Not to hard but did require some thinking. Enjoyed the story line the only part I wasn't thrilled about was the puzzles. Worth the money.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I love this series.  The digital transfer looks very nice.<br /><br />However, the subtitling leaves much to be desired.  Sometimes it is fast, sometimes it is slow, sometimes it's for the wrong episode!
B00BZOFUI2|2.0|I loved Deep Purple and I think its great they are still making music together.<br />I just can`t stand the guitar sound Steve Morse has. I love Ritchie Blackmore`s Fender Stratocaster sound.<br />The MRK1 purple with Rod Evans and Nick Simper was also great.<br />Steve pickup a Strat please!<br />Great song material here and God bless those who love it. I can`t get past the guitar sound.<br />Steve Morse is a great guitarist but he just doesn`t sound right for Deep Purple.<br />The ghost of Ritchie Blackmore strikes again.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I'm a big fan of fantasy and some sci fi in both books and movies. I liked this movie so much I just had to buy it. The cgi is really wonderful. I enjoyed the plot (because at heart I'm a tree hugger) and because the protagonist sees the plight of the native people and realizes that they have a right to live their lives without being decimated by big business for something that they have no use for themselves.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|How are husbands and wives to know how to keep relationship alive after honeymoon. We've been living together/married for 40 years. Kids gone facing retirement, something was missing. Went to Life Coach/marriage counselor and she directed us to 5 Languages. So glad she did. Brought number of things to our attention. All Good!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very addictive. I love the different dragons you can breed.<br />You raise each Dragon with food you grow on the farms you build.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Have liked all of Nelson DeMilles book. Could not put this one down till done. Keeps you guessing till the end. Really like having John Corey in it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Interesting and enjoyable flick.  Kind of Romeo and Juliet and Gladiators and future shock all rolled into one.<br />The costuming was great as were special effects, We thought it was good  enjoy!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I enjoy this . Watch video that other places can't get . Enjoy it very much glad that I can watch video that you-tube can get.

B004GYY714|4.0|Best App I've found for Radio Surfing. Can tune in to Podcasting and other Venues with a click of your mouse.
B002HXR542|4.0|Having seen the remake QUARANTINE, I had heard and read that the original was a far better film. I couldn't agree more. This point is actually tragically unfortunate do to the fact that the two movies are almost exact replicas. [REC] was done in a far more fan pleasing method. The acting was more believable, the characters were more likeable, the pace was faster and the movie was just overall more enjoyable. This returns us to my original comment of how unfortunate it was that I saw QUARANTINE first. Since these films are replicas, I knew exactly what was going to happen which really took away from the suspense and tension of what should have been a great watch. Another Hollywood remake ruins a, should be, classic film. So for people who haven't seen QUARANTINE this is a 4 star flick. Otherwise, this is only 2.5 to 3 stars.
B003VPOXAE|4.0|A book group that I belong to decided to read this book.  Many of us had read it before, but a number of years ago.  It is definitely worth picking up again or reading for the first time.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|SOME SPOILERS IN HERE BUT NOT REALLY I love a good revenge movie! And this is one! Good story and an interesting M-O. I loved the idea for this movie. It chose a controvertial topic and really ran with it. The judicial system has been known to have its flaws and sometimes if people want justice they have to take it. A man (Gerard Butler) goes ape s*** for ohhhhh ten years plotting and scheming over the death of his family. Hell bent on his lack of justice after the main culprit of his family's death gets a ridiculous plea bargain. Well, this man decides to enact revenge not just on the killers, but on the whole judicial system. Because, you see, he is a war device inventing genius who has been helping the special forces for years. Sweet! Action thus ensues and you are left wondering, how the hell is he doing this stuff. Well you gotta watch to get this little tidbit. There have been complaints about the ending and while it is tough to make a truely satisfying ending to a movie that starts out so strong, it isn't that bad. But I also say judge this one for yourself and give it a watch.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I sought this band/album out after repeatedly hearing \\"Radioactive\\" on at least two of decent & available \\"commercial\\" stations, and finding myself curiously hoping to hear it again.  Not that I ever want to have to actively succumb to FM.  Found (t)hem on amazon, listened to the 10 second clips and really wasn't sold on the rest of the songs.  Old school as I am, I do have to buy CD's of artists \\"new\\" to me that grab my interest for some reason.  Been burned a few times, but most often am surprised by overall content.  I do have to say that the clips here do not at all properly represent what is available on this album.  No, I didn't know the \\"hit\\", to be honest didn't know they had one prior to the one I got hooked by.  Not all so dark as no. 1 track, but it's all a good listen.  Almost \\"all over\\", but the spectrum is rather enjoyable.  Well worth buying the entire album.  Great work!  I'll be following this band from here on out.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|As equally bad as the first 2! I don't know why I keep watching to see if somehow it would be different this time. It was not. A whole lot of nothing and then some. This one actually makes the first seem better? So I'm assuming you've already seen the first 2 so you are well prepared for what you get. A bunch of household cameras filming a lot of nothing. This time it was the woman's turn to doubt the hauntings. Completely ridiculous! Especially with the videotaped evidence that was caught in this one? The reactions of people are completely illogical, unbelievable and totally unbearable. Three strikes and you're out! At least I am positive that I will never waste my time trying to watch another one of these movies again.

B002ZG99TK|4.0|Just starting his job at a Pennsylvania railroad company Will (Chris Pine, \\"Star Trek\\") is met with the usual cold shoulder treatment from a lot of the veterans that have been with the company for years. He is paired with a veteran engineer named Frank (Denzel Washington, \\"The Book of Eli\\") to learn the ropes, the ins and outs of how to be an expert train conductor, it starts as a routine first day at a new job. However after two other conductors \\"somehow\\" lose their train (spoiler alert, pretty dumb on their part how they manage to lose it), Will and Frank are told to intercept this runaway train and stop it from speeding through, rolling off the tracks and wrecking a populated town in Penn.<br /><br />Oh did I forget to mention this runaway train is carrying a ton of dangerous chemicals? Cause that's kinda important. Once Will and Frank are told to find this train it becomes a race against the clock and also there's some people at the train center to advance the movie, the usual person who wants to just knock the train off the tracks no matter the damage to any nearby countryside, the one person whose on Frank and Will's side and a few other bit characters thrown in. Where this movie really shines is the pursuit and eventual catching up to the train, the whole concept of the movie sounds simple, even perhaps hokey but thanks to actors like Pine and especially Denzel this material works.<br /><br />I was very impressed with how the train sequences were done, Denzel was equal parts subdued and intense depending on the situation and Pine does show some acting chops here too. It's definitely one of the surprise movies I've seen as I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did. Also starring Rosario Dawson among others. *** out of 4 stars.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. All of his books show LOVE and compassion. This is something the whole world needs. While you read his books you come to believe there is hope if you will only  try to make a difference.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this last book of the Wheel of Time book.  Brian Sanderson did an excellent job of pulling all the characters into this summation.  It was one of those &#34;can't lay it down books&#34; because I was so anxious to see what happened next.  He will definitely be on my &#34;author to read&#34; list.  He describes enough detail to let your imagination get into the scenario and pulls in enough of the  characters from past issues (that I had forgotten) to complete a history of the entire series.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Its fun when you teleport to dark forest and Windsome woods.  At the end, if you got enough gems you can tap something called save me and you will pop in a bubble where you left off
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was one of the best ones I have ever seen. Well worth watching again and again. Can't wait for a sequel...and the entire trilogy!
0880796863|5.0|This is a great product to purchase if you're new to or just curious about the world of Tarot. Not only was it a deck of cards but also a helpful booklet to teach you everything you need to know about Tarot. Definitely deserves the 5 stars.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is very useful I use it for homework all the time it's easy to use I love it!!<br />-softballboo07
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was truly fun. I did have to start over once due to the runes, but when I did it was smooth sailing. What I enjoyed most was this wasn't like the kiddy hidden objects games.  It was geared with more mature theme.  The graphics were also good. I was surprised by that. I look forward to the next game.
1938469011|5.0|This is a great book that builds on books like John Palmer's.  I love this series of books.  I have the Hops and Yeast books.  Cant wait to get the Water Book.  I'm waiting for them to come out with the Malt Book.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This was my first Nesbo book..it will not be my last.  I could not go to sleep until I finished it last night.  Incredible.  I am not a fan of this genre normally, but thanks to Book a Day calender I thought I would try it!  don't miss this.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I've been a long time fan and its GO GREAT that I have access to all the episodes from all the seasons!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|NO need to connect to the same Wi-Fi as you computer just download this application to you phone and to the computer and make an account. Easy as that. This is amazing I love it so much. It's easy to look at my files and easy to go on Microsoft word. This is one of the best ones out there.
0345528581|5.0|This is easy to follow and easy to implement the exercises that are right for you.  A clear path to building muscle no matter where you are starting from.  No expensive equipment needed.  No monthly gym fees!  You can put together a workout that really works for you and can fit your schedule.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game once I start playing I cant stop playing get the new updates u download. I reccomend it
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Something for every Tolkien fan of any age.  This prequel to the Lord of the Rings is both great visually and honors the original work  and the other works of Tolkien, while at the same time is entertaining and tell the story in an engaging way.
B008J34466|5.0|To be honest, I ordered this CD for the one new song (with FUN singer duet).  Then I was surprised to find that I like nearly all the songs on it.  It was inexpensively priced, delivered quickly, & packaged well.<br /><br />High Note Singer
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The series has been effectively cast; the writers provided subplots in each episode that really hold interest- in addition to the larger one. There's something to ponder and learn about human nature in each one. It's a nice mix of comedic and tragic elements.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Oh my gosh, I loved it. It had a few unexpected things and that made it a thriller. It kept me turning the pages until 2:00 and I read it in less than a day. I wish she would write a 5th one. READ it !!!! It's super good. There are things that my words cannot describe about it so if you want a good book read it
B001CDD84Y|3.0|I'll admit, going in, I was prepared to hate this film.  I figured that it would Jump the Shark completely.  Well luckily, I was able to make it through the film without being devoured along the way.<br /><br />You know the synopsis, so I won't bore you with those details.  And you know that this is a high-concept thingamajig, so I won't give you that one-liner that somehow drew some producer in to greenlighting this project.  OK; so I lied.  \\"Well, there's this dude who has some genetic anomaly that allows him to 'jump' from place to place!\\"  \\"Wow, that's a really cool idea.  I like it!  Get me the script!\\"<br /><br />I did have a problem or two with this movie, of course.  First of all, how was it that Hayden Christensen was able to \\"jump\\" from place to place, but never seemed to end up in, say, the middle of a wall?  He always seemed to land in the middle of the room.  If he hadn't been somewhere before, that seemed impossible to me as he wouldn't know where to \\"land.\\"  Furthermore, this guy was supposed to have some genetic predisposition to being able to \\"jump.\\"  Now, that's all well and good -- although they don't really explain that genetic anomaly in the film, they just wave their hands about it all -- but how did he, and other \\"jumpers\\" then move other objects as well?  How did they even \\"jump\\" their clothes?  I mean, after all, I'm assuming that clothes don't really have DNA (well, the cotton is dead if it does).  Jumpers should have arrived at their destinations, well, naked.<br /><br />But I did somewhat like the love interest here; I often complain about films having a love interest strictly because Hollywood, and Americans, mistakenly believe that you always need one.  It did allow the filmmaker to use the old-and-trusted dramatic irony here and there; we knew that Mr. Christensen could \\"jump\\" but his gal-pal didn't.  (Potential spoiler.)  And a nice little cameo by Kristen Stewart at the end gave me a very good chuckle.  I wondered, \\"Who would win ina fight between a Jumper and a Vampire?\\"<br /><br />You won't be a complete Patsy if you watch this film, so I'll say this film is mildly groovy and give it a minor \\"Eh!\\"
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Loved the adventure and relationship with the animals. It was one of those books you really could use your imagination with to visualize ! Would have enjoyed a more thrilling ending!
B0063M22QO|3.0|Nice and clear tiles. Don't seem to be able to set to landscape or see how many times I've played each layout.
B001TODCII|4.0|This is NOT normally the type of movie that I gravitate towards (lots of violence), but it was easy to be taken in with the good guy/bad guy plot and rooting for the good guy. The basic storyline is that a retired anti-terrorist type of guy's daughter gets kidnapped and he goes to rescue her. In the context of that story, I was able to cheer when all the murder and mayhem happened.<br /><br />The action NEVER lags. Even though the movie is largely about \\"beat up this guy, kill that guy\\" the way in which it is done is entertaining. Since dad has 96 hours to find his daughter, you always have the sense that time is running out. This makes the movie move very fast.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is always good. The other actors are also good. The weak link would be the daughter though. She acts goofy (running everywhere with her hair flying), but it doesn't detract too much.<br /><br />If you like action and violence, you'll like it.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Great to have Rebus back - as irreverent as ever!  Some good interaction with his nemesis at &#34;The Complaints&#34;  Look forward to more books about both these characters.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who desires change, personally or professionally, and wants clear and simple support. The metaphors are great and the stories are inspiring.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I finally watched it. Hated the second half of it.<br /><br />I simply wanted to watch the Hobbit...not some Peter Jackson film which should have been called Thorin or Thorin and Gandalf Part 1: \\"Things that happen in Middle Earth\\".<br /><br />Since Bilbo is writing the story (as shown in the opening scene), how is he aware of everything that is happening in the world as we are shown over and over again with rabbit chases and albino Orcs who have no place in the Hobbit?<br /><br />The ending was atrocious. I was embarrassed watching the whole Goblin cave \\"sequence\\" (loooooong sequence) and the drama\fight scene with Thorin in the end. The troll scene was also forgettable as was the scene with Gollum. Ridiculous. Tolkien was rolling in his grave.<br /><br />Rabbit chases, cheezy orc villains, rings that accidentally fall on fingers, lots of reasons this film was a huge dissapointment for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love it! It's a fast paced game. I can't get off my kindle with this game. I definitely recommend it.
B001GMQALY|5.0|The movie features two extremely sexy actors, and their characters in this performance fail not to satisfy my expectations. I have watched this film at least 7 times, and I look forward to the next time. The relationship dynamics are powerful! Well worth the time spent to watch this movie. And besides, seeing the old technologies makes it all worth it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't read many books but my wife reads more books in a few months than I have in my life. This series I couldn't put down.  Many people find it disturbing the child cruelty concepts, but this didn't bother me. I found the story line intriguing and never a dull moment of reading.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I absolutely adore Ellen. I wish I had cable so I could watch her show. This book was the next best thing though. It was so funny, and it sent a positive message. I would recommend this book to everyone I know.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Light hearted comedy. Brilliant read, though maybe not in public unless you like people giving you funny looks for snorting with laughter in quiet cafés. Highly recommended!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I rated three because Internet wastes battery. j don't think its necessary for temple run 1 &amp; 2 to have to use Internet to run. Boo
B007RCJNDE|3.0|I found this final book to be over-long (a description that applies to the series as a whole). I felt there was a lot of hyperbole and far too much descriptive text. The events of the book took place over a short period of time but we got every event analyzed from several POVs.<br />Overall though, the book closed the cycle well and is a must-read for all of us who have read the rest of the series.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|great way to ease around the kindle fire's apps. wish all apps were this easy for the kindle fire Hd
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app does everything I want it to do. you can bring simple to vibrant and bold to antique. SOOO easy to navigate through.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I was stuck at the airport due to weather delays, and I downloaded and watched this whole movie. It was exciting and very good. I highly recommend it
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Loved reading this with my kids...a fantastic way to stir the imagination.  Plus we can visit Twain's home and see the town related to the story and characters.
B000062X90|5.0|What an album! To me it was what I would call a complete album...meaning every song is good. From beginning to end there is musical adventure, sometimes soft stuff and then suddenly rocking with those famous twin guitars. It's also good to see that the band is still rocking on in 2013.
B00005176F|3.0|BLUR. OASIS being one of my favorite bands and yes i prefer OASIS over Blur, but not here to argue about and old topic. Blur has and always will be to me one of those bands that you go ehhhh.. in my opinion some songs sound good some just dont to me, However this collection changed my opinion on the band it has some great songs &#34;UNTIL THE END&#34; is now  on my list of greatest songs of all time the sound the musicianship is amazing. There are some songs that i am not a fan, just like any album you get. But overall it is a great collection of songs and good listen.
1451668945|4.0|I've been reading Mary Higgins Clark's books religiously since the 1990s and I always look forward to her new ones coming out every April. My favorites are really the ones written in the midpoint of her career and there have been a few times in the later years when I haven't enjoyed the book as much. Daddy's Gone A Hunting, however, has much more in common with the earlier ones than the later ones, which made me very happy.<br /><br />The book centers around two sisters, one of whom was gravely injured in an explosion in the family's antique furniture reproduction plant on Long Island.  This book has more characters than some of her others, which meant that for the first few chapters, MHC was constantly introducing new characters.  It was a bit difficult to remember everyone at first, but I quickly learned who they were, although I still think there were at least two that didn't need to be included as main characters in the story.  I noticed that MHC was trying to incorporate more modern elements in the story - a few books ago, I began to think that her protagonists did not really look or sound like women in their late 20s or early 30s today (based on their dress, interests, and speech), and MHC appears to be trying to address that in this story.<br /><br />I did figure out the plot twist before the end of the book, but that really didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. I read the book in a day because I still couldn't wait to see what happened to everyone. Recommended for all MHC fans.
B000AMUU94|4.0|DAVID M**** F****** BOWIE what else is to say. The first disc is the best , it really is BOWIE at his best the second disc is a little different and not much of a fan of that bowie face but its still great and the same with disc 3. Bowie has an awesome collection of great songs all over but at the same time he's got some songs that are just not my taste. But it's bowie and he is a true artist overall. GREAT collection of his music just click purchase NOW!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I have been looking for a remote desktop that is easy to use and doesn't have a subscription tied to it.  Jump met my requirements.
B000Y2WAKM|3.0|The Eels to me was a band that was just there having some songs here and there that were pretty good and some were just not great. Therefore this collection of 96-06 is and okay listen. Some songs are skipable at least for my taste and some songs are enjoyable. I recommend you youtube their music or listen to them a bit before you purchase its not bad but not great. IT'S OKAY
0446547646|1.0|This type of story is not why I buy and read love stories.<br /><br />I think the author is a very talented writer.  I very much enjoyed the prose.  Until Chapter 19, that is, when every lovely aspect of the story started to become skewed.  And then I just knew what Sparks had in his mind to do to the ending.<br /><br />There may be some folks out there who may enjoy this type of love story, and yes, it is a love story. But I am not one of them. I buy and read love stories to feel good, not horrible.<br /><br />The love story books that I buy and love to read may be formulaic, but the authors are just as good and they know most of us read them because of the endings.<br /><br />Enough said - I do not want to ruin the ending for those of you who may like this type of book.<br /><br />My advice?  If you like to cry, and if you like to feel happiness is just a hopeless dream and never happens in real life, then Sparks and this book are a good bet.<br /><br />But if you like to laugh at life's foibles, cry at life's tribulations, and rejoice in the hope that love can and does win in the end, then stick to other authors like the following:<br /><br />Susan Elizabeth Phillips<br />Barbara Bretton<br />Suzanne Brockmann<br />Connie Brockway<br />Robyn Carr<br />Maureen Child<br />Pamela Clare<br />Julie James<br />Joan Johnston<br />Robin Kaye<br />Deborah MacGillivray<br />Susan Mallery<br />Cathy Maxwell<br />Judith McNaught<br />Teresa Medeiros<br />Marliss Melton<br />Lucy Monroe<br />Carly Phillips<br />Jill Shalvis<br />Roxanne St. Claire<br />Robin Wells<br />Barbara Freethy<br />Brenda Novak<br /><br />And there are just tons more authors who write better stories than Sparks.<br /><br />Sorry for the poor rating, Mr. Sparks, but I call them like I see them.<br />You should consider writing in some other genre.
B000003TA9|2.0|PERSONALLY DIRTY IS SOMETIMES UNLISTENABLE SOME SONGS ARE TOO NOISY AND KARENS VOICE I CANT STAND SOMETIMES NOT ONLY ON THIS ALBUM BUT IN ALL THEIR CDS, IN SOME SONGS IT SOUNDS DESCENT IN OTHERS YOU JUST PUSH THE SKIP BUTTON AND THAT IS ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS CD. ONE THING ABOUT SONIC YOUTH I FOUND AMUSING IS THE GUITAR WORK, THE SIMPLE MELODIES AND THE POOR SOUND QUALITY THAT MAKES SONIC YOUTH WHAT THEY ARE. DIRTY IS MOSTLY KAREN SINGING AND IT IS MY LEAST SONIC YOUTH ALBUM FOR THAT REASON. MAYBE IT WILL GROW ON MY BUT AT THE MOMENT I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH THE ALBUM WITHOUT SKIPPING A SONG.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I really like this game. The only thing I have noticed about these games I don't like, you don't move up in levels. You do move up, but you always start at the beginning and keep going. It's hard to explain, but I would recommend this game, besides it was free.
B0063GORYU|5.0|U never gets tired of playing it I lost track of the time it keeps my company when I gets bored im trying so hard to reload it
0385349831|5.0|I just bought this book yesterday and i'm almost finish, I will re read the book again, its like the LORD is talking to me through book and teaching me how to live life, great book
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|He is even better (if that's possible). Loved even some of the lesser known tracks like Strawberry Bubble Gum and others.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I have learned a lot about how to talk with people. I had a stroke when I was 36, my 'filter' somehow got turned off. This~AwEsOmE~ book taught me how to communicate with people again. I cannot wait to try these SIMPLE techniques out! Thanks!
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|The effects superb, the re-imagining excellent, the script wonderful, the acting...<br /><br />Rachel Weisz was excellent as the witch. She was great with her portrayal, Williams and Kunis? mmmm I'd say bad. Kunis is not a hot actress, she is not a good actress (especially for Action/Fantasy movies). She fits more into comedy (that's what ballooned her into recognition after That 70's show). Williams didn't fit into this movie.<br /><br />Then come Franco, I like Franco. He is a good actor but in this one he wasn't at all. Can't put my finger on it but it wasn't attractive nor captivating his performance.<br /><br />The movie could have been better and in fact, it could have been a whopper of a hit but...not this one.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|It is so great being able to use OpenVPN to connect to my home network and Jump Desktop to connect to my PCs and Macs there! It is like bringing my whole home network with me. Jump Desktop just works with a minimum of fuss and has a great interface for using non-touch desktop OSes on your touch based phone or tablet.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great movie. Rented it first at Red box to make sure that my son liked it. He LOVED it. It's a good story with great characters. Kidszandxadults will relate with this story.
1932735410|5.0|Love the book.  Goes hand in hand with PMBOK.  Lots of information in regards to the PMP Certification Exam.  Enjoy how Rita explains the answers to the questions.  Very helpful.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love this series!  Robert Jordan is a fantastic writer, and Brandon Sanderson was the perfect choice to take up where Robert left off after his death.  Anyone who likes a good fantasy series, I highly recommend you read these books.  It's my favorite series of All Time!
0385535147|5.0|This is now one of my favorite John Grisham books.  For a while he went through a slump (in my opinion) but this has already become a favorite.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The answer to immortality lies within.... one of the best books I've read since HP .... yes bigger than potter.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|How can a girl resist long-haired, muscular men with all of that action and drama and a little history thrown in there?  Blood, guts, sex, drugs, love, lust, crazy twists, sacrifice (in many dimensions...)  Can't. Stop. Watching...  TEN stars.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I tend to read fast---too fast.  I've found that with books such as GOT I miss a lot.  The audible books force me to hear every word.  I read this book years ago and didn't care for it.  After listening to it, I find it rich, well written and incredibly detailed.  Thumbs up!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Not only was it fun and entertaining, but challenging enough to keep me busy. I could barely put it down!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This is a fun game to play.  It is kind of like a puzzle to solve. It's not hard but makes you think at times. My daughter, a tween, enjoys it.  And so does her mom!
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|This is not a feel good story.  The characters do bad things and there's no apology for their actions.  However, the acting of Peter Mullan and Olivia Coleman is brilliant.  This is not a movie I could watch twice, but I'm glad that I took a chance and watched it once.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Warning: Data thieves<br />Slow game<br />Takes personal information<br />Developers writing fake reviews<br />I suggest to either delete or just avoid buying this game, its spyware.
0307476073|3.0|Oh the tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.  Glad this tall tale is sold as fiction.  Don't forget that Oprah bought into A Million Little Pieces until the author was busted.  In this case Cheryl Strayed, not her real name - for example, protects herself against a fraud claim with a cleverly written disclaimer right off the bat.  Yet reviewers seems to believe each word as though it were a documentary.  Take it in as a creatively told journey of what might have happen when a miserable young woman tries to swap one form of self-inflicted pain (say, heroin and random sex) for another (say, tight boots and near starvation) in order to heal some deep developmental wounds.
B001TW68P4|5.0|Just went to a &#34;concert&#34; entitled &#34;Happy Together&#34; which was put on by the Turtles and included many other artists from our era ~ back in the 70's! I didn't have an &#34;album&#34; of their music from back in the '70's, so looked to Amazon to find a CD with the &#34;best of&#34; to buy! I wasn't disappointed! Great old songs that bring back MANY memories! Thanks!!!!!  Just Love it!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I would give this app 10 stars if I could. It is so fun. The only problem is that u have to pay Fitzgerald but other than that it is awesome for kids and adults
B000092WD8|5.0|Not quite the Jack Nickelson movie, but an awesome musical. I would highly recommend it for teenagers and up. very well done.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The actors did a wonderful job with the strange characters, but there was no chemistry between the leads. I thought the book was better, and the book wasn't that great. It was just ok. De Niro and Lawerence carried this one.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It's so addictive and I have a hard time putting it down.  I love playing it and it is a great way to pass the time.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I hope I don't get sick of it!  It is just the right amout of distraction to help me relax. I can see that visual~eye x hand coordination is &#34;my thing&#34; so I hope you will be recommending other similar games.
B007V65R54|5.0|As a chemist and a fan of Bayes, I love this book.  Also found out why I've never been interested in gambling or poker, and why I was not that good a chess player.  Well written and easy to read (especially if you're at all interested in science and/or statistics)
B008HI7BMW|4.0|I am a fan of movie soundtracks and villian themes in particular and this one stands out for having two unique themes that I really like. The music used for Bane/League of Shadows is why I bought it. I would fast forward through the movie just to listen to the scenes where that music stood out. Catwoman's theme is also very good with the simple piano. It really is enjoyable to listen to. An excellent choice if, like me, you enjoy original themes from movie scores.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|I'm not familiar with the Watchmen outside of this movie, so I did not come with any expectations.  The was easy to follow along and the characters strong and yet not memorable.  With the exception of Dr. Manhattan, of course, who exudes a dark Super Man-like charm.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Do not miss this series! I watched all 5 seasons in one week! So hard to pull away from it.
B00BCV3HGU|1.0|I don't want my one star rating to make the statement:  &#34;Ugh, I hate this! &#34; but rather &#34;Wow, am I disappointed!&#34;  The most famous track &#34;Scream and Shout&#34; towers above the others in terms of lyrics, melody, thoughtfulness and production values.  And that's saying a mouthful as Scream is a hardcore dance song.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|anyone who loves a good story about the CIA and Washington and great characters will love the series. Baldacci is a great story teller and has a great imagination.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|They come close to running a promising premise into the ground, but it picks up about halfway through the season.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I'm a girl and I'm absessed with iron man(there's nothing wrong with that cause my sisters friend is absessed with captain America)  but I love avengers and I love iron man
B0043RGXJS|5.0|Just really tuned into Buble recently and I just can't get enough!  This crooner is fabulous.  So glad this style of music is making a comeback.
B001K3K5MO|4.0|a lot of action scenes along with some somber ones.  Excellent fighter flying combat scenerios in this movie.  enjoyed watching the script unfold for this good piolit
B001O1O71C|5.0|I work at a school and my students started reading this as a class. I started reading ahead and was quickly sucked into the book. It made me very emotional to think of how these people lived during the holocaust. Glad I bought this book and might even read it a second time. I finished it in two days.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I just want something to do with my hands while watching tv.  I don't want to play against my friend on facebook or whatever.  I don't like that I run out of lives and can't play anymore for a while without buying more lives.  I probably won't be keeping this one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|number one iron man game in my book<br />play it you will enjoy it<br /> it's fun different suits better graphics play online
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The subject matter was difficult but the characters were interesting and the book was a very fast read.......just the way I like it!
B004LROUNG|3.0|I love myself some John Grisham but his storylines are all beginning to sound the same. I found the story line is this book is also in another one of his books (Suing a large pharmaceutical company). But all in all, I still love reading his books.
B00433TO52|5.0|Astoundingly concentrated eloquence !<br /><br />Nothing more needs saying, but since you require sixteen more words, this should do it I hope.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I remember playing this with my mother when I was little. I play it when bored like waiting for flight that is late taking off. It doesn't need any wi-fi connection which is nice. I taught my grandson to play it last week and he helped me a lot. I enjoy using it at my elderly age as it helps with memory recall.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game and extras are reasonable cheap.but the game tends to not go in your cavorted when just about to solve tasks

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|the is a great free game with good graphics and story. the puzzles were different and challenging. I really enjoy the game.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's just like Diablo 3, I love Diablo! Very fun game. But my only con is the dragons are a little OP
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game. Everyone should play it. I LOVE IT. It is cool. It is so much fun. Please don't doubt me.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Not only is this a killer of a show, metaphorically and literally, but they release an amazing special edition for season 2, and top it with the season 3 special edition, one for the shelves.
B0087X728K|5.0|The brand and the model are well known, so do not hesitate to acquire one for you, is a great termic paste
0375758992|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book!  It is witty, sad, insightful, horrific, educational, and raw, and it tells an important story of Africa.  I became enamored of Fuller's writing style that was neither too intense, nor too breezy.  She struck just the right note in the telling of her childhood in Zimbabwe, and that telling leaves the reader wanting more.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best love stories I've ever written. At some points it made me want to cry. The love between them is like no other I've seen told in a story.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Simply amazing!<br />Kiera Cass is truly a visionary when it comes to writing these amazing novels. Two thumbs up for me!
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|BUT not a great game the good guns cost way to much glu money I'm not paying 20+ real dollars for a fictitious gun. I give it 5 stars though for gameplay well done<br /> I give it 2 stars it cost real money to get the Thompson.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun game, really good graphics. I've been playing for a few hours and have yet to be bothered to use real money.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|it was just awesome ive been a lotr/hobbit fan since I was 13.It brought out my inner geekness.it rocked. .
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Umm I really didn't understand this but it was cool to be real we have  to try something new so I did and it help out
0425252868|1.0|Simply one of the worst books I have ever read.  The author may have had enough interesting material for a magazine article but not for a book.  Then it's filled with a tedious recounting of the day-to-day adventures of the German pilot.  But worst of all, it glorifies the German air force.  Time after time, it talks about their \\"honor\\" - how they wouldn't shoot Allied pilots in their parachutes but the American and British pilots were known for doing just that. And how the Germans were just defending their homeland against the Allied bombers.<br /><br />These German pilots didn't know anything about Nazi's - \\"I Know Nothing!\\" - but their behavior didn't change after one of their number told them about Buchenwald.<br /><br />Avoid this book at all costs!!!
1449410243|5.0|I got this as a present for my 13 year old brother. He loves it and since it got him to spend 30 minutes not on a computer screen it was totally worth it. Plus, I found the book funny too since I peeked at a few pages before wrapping it up.
B005FITIIC|5.0|For me, the most satisfying movies are those that start with a great, intelligent script and match it with outstanding performances.  MARGIN CALL fits that tough standard very well indeed.  Writer/director JC Chandor has crafted a fill that makes the Wall Street machinations in the hours before the financial meltdown into a thriller that's character driven and as tense as a top-notch spy story.<br /><br />Late one afternoon, just hours after 80% of the department he works in has been laid off, a data analyst at a gigantic trading firm (Zachary Quinto) discovers that the very foundation of the products his firm has been trading has been based on faulty assumptions.  It's too late to reverse the damage...the collapse of the firm is literally at hand.  He tells his boss (Paul Bettany) and the corporate damage control begins.  In many ways, MARGIN CALL is about how the news is received by each layer on the organizational chart, up to the CEO (Jeremy Irons)...all in the wee hours of the night.  Great drama is created simply by watching the realization sink in.  The posturing and maneuvering to cling to a high paying job is always there as well, and it's fascinating to watch.  I've spent a few years working on the lower rungs of \\"corporate America\\" (not in banking/trading) and really enjoyed the attention to detail in the corporate touches.  How as the next highest level person appearing on the scene makes the previously powerful person just a step down suddenly behave like a scared college intern.  And when the CEO arrives (by corporate helicopter, no less) you can feel the fear sweating out of these men and women as they a) break the horrible news to the man who can destroy them & b) work to maneuver the situation to their advantage.  It's a sinking ship, but each person wants to go down with it rather than be thrown overboard.<br /><br />The performances are outstanding all around.  This movie is mostly talking, and it's mostly about fairly dry material.  But the script is so clear and crisp that it hums right along, and the actors all tear into it with gusto.  Kevin Spacey steals nearly all his scenes, but he's matched by the oily, riveting Irons.  Bettany is effective, and I really enjoyed Simon Baker in his role as an upper executive.  Also on hand in a smaller role was Stanley Tucci, who simply is unable to give an uninteresting performance.  Demi Moore has a small role, and I was reminded of what a great corporate mover and shaker she can be...thinking back to her role in DISCLOSURE nearly 20 years ago.<br /><br />Sometimes, the script has to find ways to make the somewhat obtuse details of the financial collapse understandable to the viewer.  These are sometimes well handled, but sometimes a bit clumsy.  When your CEO says \\"Explain it to me as though I was a child\\", you know that's meant for the audience not the CEO.  The occasional inelegance of this device, as well as the annoying presence of Penn Badgley (a far inferior performer compared to the rest of the cast) as a friend of Quinto's who has nothing really to contribute to the events of the film keep this film just below the status of classic in my book.<br /><br />But it's still an important film and it's riveting.  Even if you don't care about the details of the financial collapse, the film is well worth seeing.  When you've got Irons, Spacey, Tucci & Bettany all at the tops of their games...it's easy to strongly recommend MARGIN CALL.
B006LSZECO|4.0|....to literary exposition.  A fun way to unravel a mystery plot.  Interesting and somewhat unusual plot.  But with a &#34;meh&#34; ending.  Certainly worth the read.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved this series.  I enjoy all of the characters and the twists and turns.  Can't wait toread the next one.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|ever since patch came out I am having issues with playing the I get to play on land sometimes and when I try to go to under water park it kicks me off.  I have tried reinstalling however it didn't work this is on my kindle fire where I am having the issues
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Interesting from start to finish - great acting, a few laughs with the serious topic.  His movies are always violent but very good
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Wow -- this movie was so bad.  I was so disappointed -- I love Mark Wahlberg and was looking forward to a suspenseful movie.  I just kept waiting for the suspense but it never appeared!  I would NOT recommend.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I've played in a long time.  Very challenging.  Absolutely can't wait for the next one!
B00BGBHOS8|5.0|Great album!! I purchased both of these &#34;lp's&#34; back in '62 when I was 13 years old. I'm now 63 and both these compilations sound even better on this CD! Plus the bonus tracks &#34;Georgia on my mind&#34; make it even better !
B008D4AKYQ|4.0|Great relatively new band that is still growing. Now it is even better with Nick on the drums (late of Spock's Beard) !
B009AMANBA|1.0|This movie was such a big disappointment. With all the great reviews I couldn't wait to see it but I must have missed something. It was nothing like I expected. All about politics and passing the 13th amendment. Thought it would be more about Lincoln. I like Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field and I give them credit for the good acting they did along with the other big names, but that doesn't change the fact that this was a long, dark, boring movie. And I paid $20.00 for the DVD.
B00BDPW7XE|4.0|Even better than Part One.<br /><br />Tremendous band that has refined and sharpened their song writing and playing along with creativity over their catalog.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie, poor streaming quality.  Well acted.  Great value to have an awesome movie like this on streaming.  Poor streaming quality is a bummer.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this book (although, I was visiting Paris at the time I read it, which could have improved my capacity for enjoyment of a good book)! In it, Jill Bolte Taylor tells her amazing, first-hand account of her journey through a stroke and the recovery process. I'm a bit of a wimp and the part of the story where she recounts a vivid experience of having her stroke was a little intense for me (and, being the same age as Jill was, when she had her stroke, made me relate to the story a little too well).  But, again, I'm a wimp when it comes to stuff like that.  Some of the things I gained from reading this book include: (1) a better understanding and awareness of how my brain works, (2) an understanding of the symptoms (and recovery process) of stroke, which will be very helpful if I, or someone I love, is experiencing them, (3) a perspective on how to think about and relate to people who's brains (or bodies, for that matter) work differently (and not better or worse) than my own, and (4) a deeper connection with humanity and the world around me. I'm very grateful for having had the opportunity to read this book and for Jill's hard work in her recovery and sharing of her story with the world. Go read this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If u want something to occupy little ones or even yourself this is a fun game and it. I give it 5 stars
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was never predictable. The story took you on a thrilling ride. I felt the characters were well developed and interesting.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very fun and enjoyable. A lot of people compare it to Temple Run&trade;, but there is no comparison. Instead of just running around obsticles, there are wepons and health and damage and special moves and enimies and pretty much everything. Stark Credits&trade; are extreemly easy to get, while the jems or whatever are a little harder. The game has both comic and movie referances, and will please fans of either form of media. Most good superhero games are not free, but this is just as good exept mostly free! Some people might not like it because its chalanging and frustrating for some people, but its worth a try.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was tremendous.the story line took you on a terrific ride. The characters were brilliantly developed.<br />The way the story was told was suspenseful and intriguing.

006114665X|5.0|Ever since I received Barbara Tuchmann's classic \\"The Guns of August\\" in my youth I have been intersted in the beginning of the tragedy that was World War I. That horrible war slaughtered millions of persons and set the stage for the worse horrors of World War II. Dr. Christopher Clark a professor of European History at the University of Cambridge is a brilliant young scholar whose knowledge of the antebellum world of European diplomacy and politics is profound. It was a very complex world!<br />The major players in the deadly chess game were:<br />a. Germany-Led by bellicose Kaiser Wilhelm II who wanted Germany to expand its territory via colonies and the building up of a major sea fleet to rival Great Britain.<br />b. The United Kingdom-The British had to deal with problems of Irish Home Rule and keeping peace with continental rivals France, Germany and Russia. The Entente Cordial signed in 1904 drew England, Russia and France into a mutual pact of defense against the Triple Alliance nations of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy. (the triple alliance was formed in 1882). England would be drawn into the war following Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia.<br />c. Serbia-The Slavic nation was involved in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie on June 28, 1914. in the Bosnian capital of Sarejvo. The Black Hand and nationalistic groups wanted Serbia to expand in the region. Two Balkan wars involving such participants  as Romania, Bulgaria, Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire stirred up trouble in the Balkan region.<br />d. France-The government of President Ponicaire was oppposed to Austria Hungary and Germany. The French declared war on the Triple Alliance following the assassination in Sarvejvo. The French were able to draw Great Britain into the conflict on their side as well as Russia<br />e. Russia-The vast nation was ruled by the last Tsar Nicholas II. The Russians defended Serbia and was the first nation to mobilize for War.<br />  The book is not an easy read! The first part \\"The Road to Sarejvo\\" describes the events in the Balkans in the beginning of the twentieth century which led to the assassination in Sarejvo. Part II deals with European diplomacy in the years prior to the outbreak of World War I. Part Three deals with the tense weeks from the assassination in Sarejvo in June until the outbreak of world war in August.<br />  The book is a rich repository of little known information which will be an eyeopener to many American readers. The same secrets, dirty tricks and terrorism of that distant time are still with us in the 21st century. A collation of pungent quotes will give you a \\"feel\\" for the prose :<br />\\"After 1903, the attention of Serbian nationalists was focused mainly on the three-way struggle between Serbs, Bulgarians and Turks unfolding in Macedionia.\\"-p. 33<br />\\"Nevertheless a war between Austria and Serbia did not appear likely in the spring and summer of 1914.\\"-p. 113<br />\\"In the mid 1890's,after a long period of stagnation and relative decline, naval construction and strategy came to occupy a central place in German security and foreign policy.\\"-p. 147<br />A description of Kaiser Wilhelm II: \\"He was an extreme exemplar of that Edwardian social category, the club bore,who is forever explaining some pet project to the man in the next chair.\\"-p. 182<br />\\"...the positive depictions of military conflict to be found in newspapers and the books read by boys of school age.\\"-p. 237<br />\\"Serbia was now Russia's salient in the Balkans.\\"-p. 279<br />\\"In the summer of 1912, it was not at all clear that France would support Russia in a purely Balkan conflict.\\"-p. 293<br />\\"...the protagonists of 1914 were sleepwalkers, watchful but unseeing, haunted by dreams, yet blind to the reality of the horror they were about to bring into the world.\\"-p. 562<br />  \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" is an excellent history book which is a difficult though important book.

This is the most convenient way to watch HD on the ps3/xbox  the price is a bit high, but I'll treat myself every once in a while
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Her best work so far. The low soulful thrown over, what essentially is, hip hop beats make great tracks. Give her a shot.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love it!!! Worked well in carrying my stuff to the beach and Chicen Itza in Cancun Mexico. Kept it clean of dust and made it look inconspicuous to others so I didn't have to worry about it getting stolen.
0634049011|3.0|You learn the fretboard, but not really how to read music. It is helpful, but you will need additional instruction to become a good guitarist. I think this book has something to offer guitarists who already have a reading background but want to add more fretboard theory.

This is NOT the case with this one. I opened it and was drowned with recepies I wanted to try out. And I was not dissapointed with the outcome. Finally my vegan baking had been perfected. It had been good before but these recepies took it to a higher level - without any extra work! Its fantastic! This is by far my no 1 baking cook book! I love it!

0385737955|3.0|In the Maze Runner Thomas, our memoryless protagonist, wakes to find himself in a community of boys (cringe) trapped in an ever changing maze-like structure. Horrible half-metal creatures stalk the structure day and night - and no-one has found an exit.<br /><br />The tale mostly covers Thomas' rise to popularity and acceptance by the team and inevitable confrontation of the maze's creators.<br /><br />The story is well done in action and mystery, although the latter gets a bit cheesy at times. In total the Maze Runner is nothing stand-out, but at least isn't a poor read.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I know they had to build the story for us to understand the characters, but it became a little slow and hard to follow.  I also was disappointed that they left out the practice that the solders did prior to the attack on the compound, made it seem like they were not fully prepared which was not accurate.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times.  One of my favs!  I would recommend it to all age groups.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The movie is good at keeping the tension level high.  I did not like some of the &#34;artistic license&#34; they took with some of the historical facts of the case. The original facts of the case make for a superb story and they didn't need to change them in order to make a compelling movie (such as the implausible chase scene on the runway towards the end of the movie).  However, overall it was a very good movie.

B005VMVUAQ|3.0|Trespass(released Sept/11)was directed by Joel Schumacher and stars,among others Nicolas Cage as Kyle Miller and Nicole Kidman as Sarah Miller.It is a film with alot of promise,as Cage is quite convincing in his role,as is Kidman,but as the film rolls on it becomes just another average watch,typical of its type.<br />The story finds Cage as a diamond buyer/seller.As he rolls home to see his wife and daughter whom he hasn't seen in a few days,he is on the phone to a potential client for whom he must dash out later to clinch a deal.After a fairly brief stay he is going out when the \\"police\\" show up at his gate wanting to see them about burglaries in the area.When they open the door three men and a woman burst in and the game is on;they're there to steal his stash of diamonds and/or cash.<br />As the heist progresses we learn that one of the burglars has more than a passing interest in his wife and in fact was in the house posing as an electrician of sorts and casing the joint.While they think they know Cage's m.o.,it eventually comes out that Cage is in fact broke.He lost his permanent job and has been just eking by with little sales now and again which barely keeps their heads above water.After much torture and threats Cage finally opens the safe to them and nothing is in there.By this time the group are starting to get antsy and time is running out,as it seems one of them owes their boss almost $200,000 from drugs that were stolen off of him.<br />The end of the film comes down to a confrontation in the still under construction part of their new house.A well placed scuffle later and a hidden wall is opened which reveals a huge amount of cash Cage hid,so if the bank repossessed the house they would have at least something.But now one of the men is going to shoot Kidman and the other shoots him dead.A fire breaks out and the last man is burned to death.Kidman holds onto Cage for dear life who has two gun shots in him.Fade to black.<br />The cast is certainly a good one and as I mentioned Cage and Kidman both did good jobs in their respective roles,but it just wasn't good enough to offset that been-there,done-that feeling.There just was nothing distinctive enough and/or atypical to elevate this flick above any others of its genre.<br />Technically speaking the film is crisp and clear in its 2:35:1 w/s a/r.Extras include three featurettes and a cast a crew interview.<br />All in all a disappointing effort from Schumacher,from whom I would expect more.His end product is just an average flick for its kind and it fails to excite at all.e and as I mentioned Cage and Kidman both did good jobs in their respective roles,but it just wasn't good enough to offset that been-there,done-that feeling.There just was nothing distinctive enough and/or atypical to elevate this flick above any others of its genre.<br />Technically speaking the film is crisp and clear in its 2:35:1 w/s a/r.Extras include three featurettes and a cast a crew interview.<br />All in all a disappointing effort from Schumacher,from whom I would expect more.His end product is just an average flick for its kind and it fails to excite at all.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|My child loves it. It was great for family night. We watched the whole series. It was great. I loved it.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Fun game a bit spendy. Easy to play..can't get to far without paying. More worth 2.99. Recommended as match 3 game.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I love the movie. I love the actors in the movie. I have watched it more than once and still can't wait to watch it more.
0988936402|5.0|I started this book with very little experience reading fantasy novels and wasn't sure what I was going to think about it. From a couple of chapters in I had lots of questions I wanted answering and couldn't wait to find the answers. The author wrote the book very well, it was a great story and a fantastic read. I really enjoyed it and was totally engrossed in the book to the very end. The descriptions throughout the book was good and painted a vivid picture in my mind. I finished the book with all the questions I had at the beginning answered. I look forward to reading the second book in the series. I would totally recommend this book to YA and adults alike, I think it is a good book for all to read. It definitely ignited a new found love for fantasy novels.
0761169253|5.0|This was a surprising book! It is full of deep little quotes that hit home.  They are little mind clearing ideas!
B008602KQI|5.0|Very suspenseful. The lead character, Katniss, impressed me enough to name my new Siamese cat after her, Catness. The alternate spelling seemed appropriate.
B00000J2PH|5.0|These songs remind me of yesteryear. I loved the music, loved the lyrics, very soothing!  Kind of lyrics you want to sing along with
B008CIUS72|2.0|When downloading this app. Thought I could read all kinds off apps with news books.  Did not world.  So needless to say I was kind of upset.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I bought all three seasons o Blu-ray and it was definitely worth it.  The quality is wonderful and the story is one that is timeless and canbe enjoyed by anyone who loves British productions.  I am sure that I will watch this series repeated times.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I have had many laptop bags and this one is by far the best. The tablet and laptop sleeve is great. The hard shell on the front is nice for cell phones, sun glasses, or other items that need some extra protection. There are many pockets and compartments to fit a lot of items into. Some people have complained that the backpack is too big. I am 5'8&#34; and 145 lbs. and the backpack does not feel over-sized at all, even for someone of my size. The shoulder straps and back are well padded and it fits very comfortably, so I don't know what they were really expecting. This is probably one of the most well produced bags you will find and I would highly recommend it to others. Even though it is a little pricey.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an awesome site. I get so many ideas. Some of which I've used several times & others I'm waiting till I have time.
B009A87X80|5.0|What an amazing voice.  I have listened to this CD over and over.  It is soothing after a rough day.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is a good game but it doesn't have the same play time that the Mahjong on the computer does. Not enough challenge.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Very good. Enlightening. Did not the relationship between president Johnson and president Nixon.  I liked the camaraderie between Bush 41 and president Clinton.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It was based on a true story that I hadn't previously known.  It was fascinating and very well acted.  I highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|OK, so this is a Googlish/Kindlish kind of app.  It isn't the link you normally think of with Google.  This one is a entirely different styled page and heavily censored.  Better to save the memory and just save the original Google link in your favorites.
140271453X|5.0|How many times can one continue to re-read Conan Doyle's classic stories--lots. Nothing I can say can add anything to these famous, witty, thought-provoking, puzzling vignettes that, while full of archaic London yet remain currently compelling. They're simply delightful and none of the film versions have done them justice. This particular book is well-bound, of convenient size and heft, and has a handy ribbon attached to hold you place. I'll go out on a limb and say every good home needs a copy of Sherlock Holmes.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Excellent watch for the money. Delivered on time and is great then on picture. This is my first automatic and I love the fact that I never have to replace a battery
B000E33W1W|5.0|The DVD was fine and it has been played over and over by my grandson. I have ordered many DVD's through Amazon and have always been completely satisfied with all the merchandise. I look to Amazon before I ever think about going and searching at the stores. They are so much cheaper and the quality is always just what I expect.<br />Thanks<br />Sandy
0064430170|2.0|The fanfare for Goodnight Moon is significant, and perhaps the educational psychology behind selective item repetition between pages is too complicated for me.  Be that as it may: bowl full of mush on one page, then bowl full of mush in a room, then goodnight bowl full of mush.  Yep, my kids are ready for Yale now.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Right from the beginning, I had to keep reading even through it was very sad.  But I liked the ending.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Got it so my wife and I can share shopping lists etc. We each set up accounts - me on my PC and Android; and her on her lap top, I-pad and i-phone but we can't share without upgrading.  We will continue to e-mail each other as we did before trying Evernote
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely amazing, so many great characters and none of them safe.  Just as good as the first two books in the series.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|Gave this review one star because the CD came to me scratched. I can't listen to a large portion of it. Love the band but only if I can hear them.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This will be a perfect addition to my collection. Recommended to everyone who is a collector of good movies and enjoy watching them.
157421327X|5.0|There are no Certified Zentangle Teachers nearby so I was very pleased to find this book which explains the basics of Zentangles and provides easy examples to follow.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a very fun game despite being a very baybyish game.I would recommend it for 3-11 year olds. The aim of the game is to run away from a policeman while jumping over barriers and trains.it does get slightly boring so you come off and you want to go back on. Thankyou
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have only viewed the first two episodes so far and it is living up to its reputation.  It is just as much as season 1 to watch.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|After watching every single episode of my little pony I love this game everybody should have it best game ever I am all ready level 17
B001MM28JG|4.0|I've been a fan of Galaxy Quest for years and found it on Amazon Instant Video for 5 bucks!!! I watched it the same night and its just as funny as I remember!!!
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Been listening to DM for over 25 years. If I had reviewed this CD after the first time I listened, I would have given it 2 stars. I was terribly disappointed on my first time through. After listening a second time, I still hated it. Now, less than two weeks later, there's not a single track that I dislike.<br /><br />If I want to hear Violator, Black Celebration, or Music for the Masses then I'll go listen to those. I own them already.  Delta Machine is not a rehash of what has already been done before, yet it is not so foreign as to alienate me.<br /><br />Before writing your review, give it some time to see if it grows on you. I love it when a CD challenges me with something different. This one does, yet it is still completely Depeche Mode being Depeche Mode.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is my new favorite book. It had me laughing, crying, hopeful and heartbroken. What an unexpected treat. Thank you Amazon prime, I wouldn't have read it without you. Will recommend it for my book club. Loved the Irish phrases and accents, kind of a challenge to decifer at times.
B00CMT54DA|4.0|\\"Mud\\" (2012 release; 130 min.) is the newest film from writer-director Jeff Nichols, who just last year brought us the excellent \\"Take Shelter\\" thriller (starring Jessica Chastain). As the movie opens, we get to know two young boys, 14 yr. old Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan) and his best friend Neckbone (played by Jacob Lofland), in a small boat on the Mississippi river, on their way to an island where they have found something incredible: a boat that somehow ended up high in a tree. The boys think the boat is abandoned and want to make it their playground, only to find out that someone is living in the boat: Mud (played by Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a refuge of the law for killing a man who got involved with Mud's on-again, off-again girlfriend Juniper (played by Reese Witherspoon). Mud gains the trust of the boys and convinces them to assist him in getting the boat lowered from the tree. We also get to know Ellis' family, as his mom and dad are going through tough times and are contemplating divorcing. This frightens Ellis as it may lead to having to move away from his beloved house on the river. At this point we are not even half-way through the movie. Is Mud really who he claims to be? Will the boat be lowered from the tree? Do Mud and Juniper find true love? Will Ellis find a way to save his house on the river? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: this movie feels like a tour-de-force from Jeff Nichols. Even though \\"Take Shelter\\" was itself quite good, \\"Mud\\" feels like a quantum leap forward, both in the writing and the directing. The Mississippi river and surrounding Arkansas landscapes play a huge role in the movie, and at time it all feels quite surreal, or at least there is a sense of magic-realism. McConaughey plays another great role (although for me not quite as career-defining as his role in last year's \\"Killer Joe\\"). But as much as I like McConaughey, the film is stolen by young Tye Sheridan, who acts and has a screen presence far greater than you might expect. In that sense, and as the movie ultimately is more about Ellis than it is about Mud, the movie could've just as easily have been called \\"Ellis\\". Jacob Lofland in the role of Ellis' friend is great as well. The two boys take up a huge amount of screen time, and hence this movie reminded me of that great movie \\"Stand By Me\\" from the mid-80s, starring a then young and unknown River Phoenix. Sheridan surely looks to have the talent and the chops to build a long and rewarding acting career.<br /><br />This movie premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, to generally great acclaim, and for the life of me I do not understand why it has taken almost a year to get the movie finally released in US theatres. The screeing I saw this at this weekend here at my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati was very nicely packed, I'm happy to say. Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a top quality indie movie that is miles away from the standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. \\"Mud\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!y, the film is stolen by young Tye Sheridan, who acts and has a screen presence far greater than you might expect.

B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I haven't used this calculator much, but will probably keep it, for future use.  After all it's a free app
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|A very interesting concept that could have been reduced to a silly kids film. Doesn't take itself too seriously, but just a really feel-good, nice movie.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I may end up deleting this one from my Kindle Fire as well.  Again it was a free app, so no money lost.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a well written film and concept that is PERFECTLY cast. Bud Cort & Ruth Gordon were made for these roles.
B004GYY714|3.0|Honestly, I haven't tried using this app.  I may end up deleting it from my Kindle Fire.  It's a free app, so no money lost.
B005LAII12|5.0|Whether you're a Family Guy fan or not, this is just a great film. Funny, sweet and unabashedly vulgar is all part of its charm.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Love pretty much anything with R. Crowe, but this beats them all!! Everyone should watch it, esp. Americans, to remind ourselves of honor and sacrifice for our country's original values.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Tongue-in-cheek, dated and a bit silly almost...this is still a fantastic film with a great concept. Kurt Russel's character (Snake Plissken) is a joy to watch. Just as an aside...the soundtrack by John Carpenter is a must-buy on CD.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very interestng.  I had never heard of this chapter in American history.  I especailly enjoyed going back and forth between Molly's story and Vivian's.  I would - and have - recommended this book to many friends.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Awesome book and worth the read.  I think all of the critics haven't actually read the book!  She isn't saying everyone should work, but instead hope that everyone (both men and women) should be able to pursue their passions, be respected for them and lean in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it. It Very fun but if u have to work a lot then don't get it because it is addicting.some times when it gets faster it gets glitchy but it's still good
2090338628|5.0|Can't praise the Grammaire Progressive du Francais workbooks and corrected exercise books enough. They give you plenty of practice figuring out the ins and outs of French grammar. Highly recommend them if you are serious about becoming fluent and want to master French grammar.
B000063DHL|5.0|In my opinion, and I know many may disagree with this, Somewhere in Time is the highlight of Iron Maiden's career.<br /><br />I like how it is a departure from their previous sound on Powerslave. They use a lot of synths and guitar effects making the album sound much fresher. Unlike a lot of 80s rock albums it hasn't dated too.<br /><br />It's a shame they don't play more of Somehwere on Time live. The band have only really played Heaven Can Wait and Wasted Years live, but pretty much everything on the album is of at least reasonable quality.
B000PUB9I2|5.0|Many times singers really make it difficult to understand their lyrics, but Ms. Cabrel's lyrics are hauntingly beautiful and understandable. I am a French student and I use his CDs to help me master understanding the spoken language.
B00009L1UP|4.0|Although Operation: Mindcrime was probably their most critically acclaimed album Empire was Queensryche's most commercially successful. Propelled by the hit-single Silent Lucidity Empire went triple platinum and was backed up by more chart hits like Jet City Woman, Another Rainy Night and Best I Can. However there is much more depth to the album than these singles. Anybody Listening and Della Brown are just as thoughtful as anything the band had done before (or since) while lesser known tracks all have their attraction - Resistance, Hand on Heart and The Thin Line for example.<br /><br />Empire is a very consistent album that you could listen to right through without wanting to skip a track.
0345803493|5.0|I already had books one and three, and read the entire trilogy over a couple of weeks. Truly a fantasy, but with enough &#34;mystery&#34; to keep you intrigued and involved. Erotic, of the soft-porn variety, and somewhat whitewashed in that regard. Loved it. So did my husband!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This was my first custom build ever. Ive had laptops before and as we all know those things get hot! on my laptop i would usually average like 50-60 degrees while idle and 90-95 while under heavy load. On this processor i average 30-39 idle and 40-45 under medium load (I say medium load because I've only so far played games on it and surfed the web). I am also on the stock cooler! so i would expect much lower temps on an aftermarket one. definitely recommend if you play games and do a lot of things at once.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Neil Gaiman is not pedestrian and does not follow formulas.  You want to know and understand his characters.  The story is always interesting.  This story brings in the gods we think of as belonging to Greece but in fact they are part of all of us and seeing their character through the eyes of America is very thought provoking and quite enjoyable.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I wish I had known about this diet years ago as it really does work. Most of my friends are also on thois diet and are all losing wieght steadily
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Books written by this author are for people that want to know and understand things.  It is not just a mystery; it is a veiw into a real world that few people actually get to see.  Kathy Reichs never gets on a soap box but she does make you question the injustices in life.  This story takes you into a previous unseen part of Canada and opens a new window.  If you like this author and her writing you will not be disappointed.  I look forward to the next book.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book should get one thousand awards. Funny, cool, awesome and super this book is.Perfect for people who love Percy and Greek Mythology.
B000SGSU58|4.0|I enjoy the character Harry Bosch.  It does not matter if you read his saga in order, they are easy to figure out where you are in Harry's life.  This one shows how messed up the judicial system has become and how the press manipulates details to make stories bigger and better than what they need to be.
B0033TI4BW|3.0|The books gives some good references for what motivates people, however since it is a recopilation of good expericences it can't delve into the different topics it covers.
1616550414|5.0|It has tons of cool concept art, spanning across the entire series! I'm a big fan of Zelda and art, so this is a perfect book for me!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Slow at first. But in a few minutes you're up and running. Lots of fun. Great to pass the time.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|i love this, outside of the movie. Sorry, this is short and sweet to the point. Great insight for different perspective of any sort of disorder.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Very good surround sound and comfortable to use. However did find that the drivers and software that came with the head set is abit buggy. Anyway still a good product overall.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Lots of fun if you like match three games. The graphics are beautiful and I like how it gets more difficult as you move through the levels. I would definately recommend.
0071766588|4.0|I liked it because you can see your weaknesses when you do the practice test, and is good to be prepared and realistic about the real exam.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game because all the suits and flying and the weapon's and how you can upgrade I love this game I play it like all the time
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|An amazing picture of and story about contemporary India. Despite the newly educated middle class, chage for the lower classes is going to be agonizingly slow.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This was a very different type of perspective for me to read. The book had some very REAL GOOD HIGHLIGHTED FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
1484844858|5.0|I read this book as a little girl.  I forgot how much I loved it.  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of my all time favorites.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game its so fun to challenge your self in by trying to beat your score but the only problem kind of is that it can be late on updates and freezes on the kindle fire,other than that its a great game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is  a positively outstanding production.  The acting, the scenery and the continuity of all the subplots has me<br />spellbound in every episode!!!!  Leave it to the British to create such a Masterpiece!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a book that has an incredible ending. This book has a lot of twists and turns. It is an incredible story.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. I love the music and the levels and dang does it get challenging. So much fun on my Kindle. Love it :)
B00B22IJXK|3.0|Not a bad app. If it had a few more options it would great. Fun to play with and will keep on my phone for future updates.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series.  Only gripe is that the story is so long that I can't remember half the plot of what I already read.  Can't wait to read the next 2.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Wish there'd been some help in the game.  Got stuck a couple of times and had to go to the web to find answers.  Otherwise, it was fun to play.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is not my typical kind of reading. I felt that is was slow but interesting enough to keep reading. It is set outside of USA so some of the language was unusual but entertaining. I was able to predict the ending about 2/3's of the way through. I liked the ending. I enjoyed this book.
B00BPA6XUK|2.0|Not being familiar with the composers at all, I didn't know what to expect from this soundtrack. However I didn't expect it to be such a huge reworking of the Zimmer / Newton Howard score for the Dark Knight trilogy. Although the music is very well arranged and performed, there's no doubt the movie was temp tracked wall to wall with the Dark Knight scores and the composers had their orders to deliver the same sound. Which they did. There are a few nice tracks, but the constant references / reworkings of that distinctive Dark Knight sound was so distracting I could not enjoy the score on its own.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The most heart rending and inspiring book I have ever read. Adam Brown is the definition of a great man in every aspect of his life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome that's is all I got to say the graphics are great as well as the character
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I'd passed this recommendation by a few times because it sounded kind of lame and a little too much like an Oprah special. Finally I gave in... and I'm glad I did!  The young woman's journey from foster home to the real world and her salvation through flowers was intriguing and well-written. I didn't love the ending -- a little too predictable, a little too sudden, a little too saccharine -- but overall this was worth the read!
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This movie was awesome. Great throwback to late 40's early 50's all the suits, guns, scenery, and cars were authentic and cool. The story and plot were basic but pretty good.  A group of good hard cops form a unit to get the gangster bad guy. (similar to untouchables) There's lots of great shootouts and action to be had. The story is complimented with a slight  twist of romance but not so much that it ruins the movie for us guys. All the cast gave good performances and overall it was an excellent movie.  If you like gangster movies I think this is one you'll enjoy.
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|While I agree that the permissions and spyware inclusion are awful, Liquid Entertainment is (or maybe used to be?) a reputable game company.  The iOS version of this game won a number of awards, such as Best of 2012 from Jay is Games -- a reasonably well known not-fake review site.  In short, it's a fun game if you like the qualities other reviewers have listed (running, cute graphics, upgrades, level-based, etc.), and they screwed up by using Flurry Analytics.  They do have a history of listening to customers, however, and I remain hopeful that they'll release an update that removes the spyware.  Until that happens, though, I'm not going to reinstall it.
1423140605|5.0|My daughter got the 1st book from the school library and was instantly in love with the story.  I ordered this one for her and she loves it.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I was curious to see this move since it had so many oscar nominations.....just didn't really enjoy the storyline at all.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very emotional and drags the reader into the story which creates a dramatic involvement to the characters. One of my new favorites!
B005R32L66|4.0|Easy to install, easy to use. Like the app, it was a good choice to download. I recommend it to others interested in face to face calls
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game seems to e very hard to play against on campaign mode<br />Computer seems to be far superior<br />However very good strategic game.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I rate this more then a 5 star.. very touching movie<br />Some parts are very sad and then in the end very touching
B001EBV0OY|5.0|this movie is based on a true story. The things that it shows actually do happen, People don't want to believe it because it's cruel hard facts. Most people don't care for the truth because the truth hurts them. I have seen this type of thing happen myself and I do know it's so very true, Harsh yes, but true. Most would like to deny these things don't actually happen I would like to think they didn't, but I do know they do. I always thought it was supposed to be innocent until proven guilty? Somewhere along the years, It's changed? Now Guilty until proven innocent? That's not what I was taught in school?
0061950726|5.0|From 1854-1929, orphaned, abandoned, and disenfranchised children were put onto \\"Orphan Trains\\" that rode out into the midwest depositing children and giving them to whomever would take them.  Older boys and babies were most welcome.  Older girls were often not taken.  The older boys were often taken for farm work, and the babies were taken by couples.  Sometimes older girls were put into service sewing or watching younger children.<br /><br />Niamh lost her parents in a fire in New York.They had arrived not long before from Ireland.  She was sent on the orphan train and was placed with a couple who had her sewing in their small dressmaking shop.  Her name was changed to Dorothy.  Then when the Great Depression started and the shop went under, she was placed with a \\"white-trash\\" type of family.  After being attacked by the husband, at age 10, she fled, and then was placed with some shop-owners who renamed her Vivian.They treasure her, having lost their only daughter to illness some time before.<br /><br /> The story changes back and forth from that time to 2011.<br /><br />Molly, a part-Indian girl placed in a series of foster homes, is assigned as community service to help now 91 year old Vivian to sort out her possessions saved over the years.  A friendship grows, and their stories are compared chapter by chapter.  This was a very well-written book, and has historical significance.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is actually excellent movie. I ordered this one because I've watched it so many times the one I had before was on VHS getting worn out and I wanted it on DVD. Excellent movie. I think every family should watch this movie Dustin Hoffman played this so well. It's funny, heartbreaking, tender and complex! I can see why it won 4 academy awards including best picture
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It started out slowly but emerged into a heartfelt journey with the young man.  It made me think about life in the end.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I hate veggies but I read the book and got started and it has been two weeks and I am eating lots of veggies with dressing and bacon and eggs and baby spinach salad.  I am loving it. I have lost around six pounds.  I have done everything and wrecked my metabolism. This makes me feel great. I use the bars so I do not feel deprived of so etching sweet. Love this book!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is fun and let's you relax and just build. I am a R.N. and When I get off work. I relax with this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is fun I love it my sister loves it. It's great I say it's five stars I think you would like it.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Incredible book. If I could I'd send a copy to all of my friends. Mind blown, excited to read more. On to Sagan now!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is OK, nothing special.  I don't play it.  I played it once when I down loaded it and it just wasn't what I expected.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|This album is not as good as her newest one.  My whole family loves Adele even my two year old.  We were disappoint in this album.
B00433SVP6|5.0|This book is awesome. Really well written and a fantastic story. Can't wait until the rest of the serie is out.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|This album may not be anything new but that's why I love Volbeat. If it ain't broke don't fix it!
160774273X|5.0|&#34;All good things come to wait! - and the wait was worth it!&#34;<br /><br />The book was put to use almost immediately.  Thank you,<br />the delivery was as promised, priced reasonably, and in<br />the shape advertised.  Thank You
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|What a foolish and irresponsible requirement. Because of the Facebook requirement, my kids will not be purchasing or playing any of these games from this company for now on.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book was a great read in my opinion. It talked about a lot of things I was able to relate to in life and how and why I do things and how I can actually change it. I would actually read this again and again just to reinforce the things I have learned from this book.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a very special movie and one that, in a day of so much uncertainty, warms the heat and allows a person to have hope.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll just start by saying I absolutely HATE the story. The plot, the characters, and the setting is the most ridiculous and least creative I have ever seen.<br /><br />That is not the reason I disdain this book so much, though. No, I hate this book because of the \\"author's\\" (If that's what you'd call someone with such LITTLE knowledge of literature) complete lack of talent. I mean, even when using Word on my papers for school or emails, you simply right click with your mouse on the word and this nifty option shows up for SYNONYMS! You do not need to repeat yourself 15 times per page. Like seriously, we get it. She blushes. He's hot. And perfect. WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT 5,000 TIMES!!!!<br /><br />Also, am I the only one who realizes how completely UNLIKELY it is that a completely healthy, normal virgin in her 20's who has not been through any type of sexual abuse of harassment would possible want to sign a CONTRACT saying this dude can beat the crap out of her? I mean come on. It takes quite a few sexual encounters before you really get the hang of what it is you like or dislike. And I feel like a fetish such as this would take even longer. We're not talking about hair pulling and a bit of spanking. We're talking whips and ANAL BEADS. NOOOOOOOO! that doesn't happen.<br /><br />I'm glad people who usually don't read are picking up a book and reading. But, why on earth does it have to be this one. I'm so disappointed in it, and so completely irritated that someone so dumb could make so much money off of something when many talented, intelligent, DESERVING authors don't. It's a shame. GET YOUR EROTICA FOR .99 OFF OF AMAZON LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. jeeesus...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Anything about it rocks it's got depth and meaning of how our world will turn out to be it's fantastically intreaging 5 stars definitely
B009NZQDW2|4.0|I watched this because Q.T. wrote it.  As with all of his movies, it was great. If you like Q.T. AND 90s, watch this movie
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Okay im guilty... love this movie along with all its counter parts.<br /><br />its full of action, suspense, drama. love... it has it all.<br /><br />BTW iron man 3.... AMAZING!!!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Great beginning but started to go flat.  Didn't keep my attention. Great cast, too bad the movie didn't live up to their talent.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|good plot and story idea.<br /><br />its a move worth watching.<br /><br />taking off a star because the film lacked in some acting areas.
0989254607|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  It was well-written, suspenseful, and a complete joy to read. I look forward to another book by this wonderful, new author!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Terrific!  The beautiful colors and special effects had me on the edge of my seat. Outstanding film for the whole family.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this show and keep hearing there are going to be additional shows made. Until that happens, I don't mind reviewing the Season 1. (As to new shows in the making, 'when pigs fly' is probably right -- sigh!!!)
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I really liked it. It has an amazing beginning and kept you in the story till the end. Highly recommended for an easy read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game.  But sometimes too hard to get what you need to finish a room.  Have to use credits you have before you get more.  But am addicted so I hang in and play.
0385349831|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a trusted person. I got it, read it in one sitting and told a friend. She took it, read it in one sitting and I gifted it to her. Now I have to get another one. Rarely do I tell everyone about something but I am telling all my friends and colleagues that this is a must read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family and very addicting.  Grandparents to 7yr olds play it at our house.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Considered getting the SB900 or the SB800 models. The SIZE of the SB900 is HUGE and considerably more expensive. It has a little more power, but for my purposes I don't need a MAX power system. I'm not trying to light up a school auditorium or sports arena.  The SB800 was an option, but it is an older model. The SB700 had good reviews, and after seeing that it has a KNOB on the back to set it for \\"remote\\" or \\"commander\\" to wirelessly control other wireless flashes instead of having to drill down through menus to make those settings it was a no-brainer to choose this model.<br /><br />I use the SU800 wireless controller to control the SB700 wirelessly as well as the R1C1 macro lights. No cable running anywhere to get tangled up, short out, fray or develop loose connections. The flash has a built in wide angle diffuser that stores INSIDE the top lip of the flash head as well as a mini-bounce flash card. Handy. And it comes with custom molded color filters for incandescent and fluorescent lighting. There is a micro switch on the flash head that these filters activate to communicate with the camera to set white balance accordingly. (nice touch)  Recycle times are FAST, especially if you turn the output power down a bit. Rarely do you really need FULL flash power... instead you are relying on the metering to cut OFF the power with iTTL (Nikon) metering. So... why not turn down the flash a little in the first place. Makes for MUCH faster recycle times and extends battery life.<br /><br />The flash head swivels almost 360 degrees on the body and tilts from a DOWNWARD angle of about 15 degrees to slightly over 090 degrees vertically. That covers almost every conceivable angle you'll need for a flash.<br /><br />I use this flash primariy with a Nikon D7000 body. But, it also works fine with the other bodies I use... a Nikon D70, D90 and Fujifilm S5PRO (which is actually a Nikon D200 with Fuji sensor and firmware). It works flawlessly with the SU800 wireless controller for off-camera use as well. Or, you can run it via a corded cable system like the SC series cord with or without the infrared focus assist module.<br /><br />I like the size and light weight. Plan to run NiMh rechargeable batteries in it. Some models of NiMh batteries now have a 15 quick charge capability to have one set in the flash and another set on the charger when shooting a major event (like a wedding or other event where LOTS of flash will be required).<br /><br />Summary: Similar feature set to both the SB900 and SB800, but better layout of buttons and knobs instead of relying so much on menus. Is smaller than the SB900 and similar in size to the SB800. Maybe a tad less power than either the SB900 or SB800, but not enough to be a deal-breaker for my purposes. Don't forget that it comes WITH the MOLDED COLOR diffusers for different lighting and will auto-set white balance with they are used. Nice unit.
1592332803|5.0|it's a joy to own such a beautifully written and printed cookbook. The recipes and pictures rival \\"traditional\\" methods in taste, I'm proud to share it with others, knowing they will never be disappointed.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|This app is spyware. Period. The developer ruined the reviews box with totally untrue reviews and lies. Don't believe me? Scroll down.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book even read it a second time couldn't help myself... recommend read. You'll fall for \\"dark & dangerous\\" too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like Temple Run 1 and experience Temple Run 2, you will immediately think Temple Run 1 is a bore. Now you venture in to hills, stone steps, ropes, and forest, waterfalls, and a mine. I don't know how it can get better!!! =3
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I was very disappointed with the attempt at humor and a lot of the acting. It seemed they tried to emulate what they did in LOTR and just fell short.
0786956291|4.0|The beginner book is a walk though for a little game that they start you with and it's a great way to learn how to play.  Very easy to get along with and very easy to pick up.  The DM book is a little more difficult, but completely manageable.<br /><br />Comes with a map, Player book, DM book, a set of dice, and some token markers.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I started out with the free version and bought the premium game. I can't stop playing it. Nice game for adults or kids. Play it, you won't be sorry!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|you guys just..... I mean this app is awesome thank you notch you're the best you are epic epic epic and epic
B005HED08I|5.0|Blast from the past or is it the future? Classic episodes that I remember and enjoy! Beam me up Scotty!
0062238868|5.0|My son loved this book! He is in the AIr Force and really enjoyed reading this book in his time off.
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|One of my favorite books.  The video us very hard to hear. I watched it on my kindle which is where I watch all of my Amazon movies.  The volume was at maximum and I could barely hear the movie.  Ear phones worked best. I thought the remastering of the film as very good.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|Whether you are a fan of Dylan or not - this is the greatest rock music documentary ever made.<br /><br />I found the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing by Dylan's manager Albert Grossman rivetting. Grossman doesn't pull any punches. His reaction to the Hotel staff's complaints about noise in Dylan's room is priceless.<br /><br />Dylan himself comes across as a precocious talent, who doesn't suffer fools gladly. A bit of tact and humility wouldn't have gone astray, but I guess that's the downside of genius.<br /><br />I felt sorry for Donovan. That scene where Donovan performs \\"To Sing For You' in Dylan's room is cringe-inducing. It's a nice enough song, and Dylan says so (albeit in a flippant manner), before launching into a gripping rendition of 'It's All Over Now Baby Blue'. It felt like Dylan saying 'yeh, nice try - now let me show you some real talent!. After Dylan finishes the song, the camera pans to Donovan's face. He looked like he wanted to crawl under a rock. I wonder if Dylan regrets this scene?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. After some time, you get addicted to this. Everyday, I play this every second I get. I made stuff like a mansion, a Mcdonald's, etc. Its a game that everyone should have.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I'm not sure what all to say in a review because this movie is just plain awesome!  Worth seeing and definitely worth the money to own it!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|it's better than Sims plus you can create your own world for free so if you're looking for a free good game get virtual city play ground
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I have NEVER been someone to play games but I love this game! I can start playing and totally forget the time. I find I would rather play this than watch reruns of the same thing on TV at night. It's fun to see how quickly I can get to the next level. So far, I've made it to the 5th level and can't wait to keep climbing.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|A formulaic Hollywood rom com that pretends to be deeper and more substantial than it is.  Generic acting by Jennifer Lawrence, who was better than she was in the equally overrated Hunger Games, but that's not saying much.  Even De Niro seemed to be dialing it in with a cliche role.  A real disappointment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it before and it's fun and it's even more funner on the coumputer when you get mods for it thanks
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|Some people panned 2061 and 3001.  I don't understand why.  I was sad to have finished the saga.<br /><br />Oh well, I'll pick the books up again in a few years.  I will begin reading Clarke's other stories now.  If I have read any of them, it was years and years ago.  Clarke has rekindled my love for thoughtful science fiction.<br /><br />btw. Thanks to Kindle I can afford my voracious reading habit..
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|it was not an oscar winner but it was very entertaining and the actors really played off of each other fabulously
B004JK61K0|5.0|Worked on my new Kindle Fire HD.  Easy to setup and use with different options. Would recommend it even if it was not free!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I originally had this app on my kindle fire about six months ago. I tried re-downloading it &amp; an error pops up everytime I open it. Honestly, it wasn't even worth the time downloading it. THUMBS DOWN.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is a wonderful concert video and I am enjoying it every time I watch it, over and over and over.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is fun. If you like it, I recommend dragon story and bakery story. They are kinda like this, except dragon story is mainly about dragons.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I had recently read several memoirs, all of which I enjoyed because of the author's voice. Tina Fey's superior tone was difficult to like, and  I was not able to read past the first chapter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the real minecraft not some rip off game. My friends an I love how we can connect with each other. Best game ever!
0767821769|4.0|Always enjoy Julia.  It was a movie that I had seen a long time ago.  Still nice to see it.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I got for 99&cent; and do same again and again and like the only way to attack is to punch and takes almost a full GB
B000J103OI|4.0|Thought this was a take off of another TV series that I liked and is no longer on TV.  It hurts to see people yelled at.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game in any form I can get it! Some of the tasks are simple and some are quite challenging. It makes me think before I act, which is something I, along with tons of other people, could really learn to do in life. The great thing about this game is that if you mess up or don't get a high enough rating on a task, you can redo it! Every one of 'em! It's cute, funny and makes you think.....what else could you ask for in a game?
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I can't type adequate praise on my Kindle 's qwerty.  To merely say that this was a magnificent page turner that I could not put down, minimizes how awesome this book really is. The book read in the third person but feels like first person accounts.  I started out watching a movie ( I love stories that read like movies) but very quickly I got lost and to my dismay and utter delight found myself emerged in this town with this man.  You go from these to bystander to feeling like a side kick  ugh it was mesmerizing how unexpectedly I became submerged. I was not only emotionally invested in the character I was WITH him. I was confused with him, angry with him, tired with him, scared with him, exhausted with him.  You go from watching at a distance to  close ups back to aerial wide shots to looking through his eyes and  not just his the other characters as well.  Every time a had to close it felt like a cliff hanger I couldn't wait to get back to.  I found myself  thinking damnit there'd better be a happy ending.... can't talk details without giving away spoilers.  I will say, Burke is with the CIA that should be enough for the key to the city, especially if he's assigned to an official investigation, but his credentials and his mission don't carry as much weight as you'd think it should in this small town ideal suburbia USA and you find yourself wondering wtf?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and her friends love this game. It gives her a lot of pleasure. We will definitely give it five stars.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|a really great action /thriller great dvd nice and clear she is a great action they should make part 2
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was a Margulies fan after enjoying her portrayal of Nurse Carol Hathaway on ER so when The Good Wife came on I always wanted to watch it, but due to another show conflict I wasn't able to. When I saw the series on my Amazon Prime I finally seized the opportunity to check it out. I LOVE IT! I wish I would have opted to view this show from the beginning, because now I can't even remember what show it was in the first place that I chose over it. Thank you for making this and other fantastic shows free to Amazon Prime members.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie was great. The cast was dead-on and played well together. I have watched it more than four times.
B00BF11STU|3.0|A good movie. Scenes where the Navy Seals hunt for Bin Laden are well done. Tedious at times. Beginning scenes<br />are difficult to watch. Jessica Chastain is good.

0767802470|5.0|Excellent transaction and video quality. I recommend this video to anyone interested in German history and politics. The video was tense and riveting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like the combanations of games. the games can be played any age group. some are challanging some are easy and I love how you can go back and replay games once you bet them to earn points to open up other games
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Does what it is suppose to do. Monitors my tablet and warns me when suspicious bad sites to not go on. Would recommend this app to anybody looking for free anti virus protection.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It was alright.  A little slow in some places. It was a typical Southern movie about power.  It was a sign of the times.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the game. It's fun on the kindle. I played every now and then. But when I do it's fun.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|I'm a big Chili Pepper fan but I would have liked this story regardless. Anthony Kiedis is very honest in his book about his struggles with loneliness, drug abuse and feeling alienated at times. Yes, the story of a junkie can get tiresome with its endless ups and downs. Sometimes you just want to shake him! But reading about how the band's sound and really innovative style developed is more than worth it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have this on all my devices. It tells me charge rates and discharge rates. Would recommend for tabletsand phone.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|I bought this to read on my way to Istanbul to get myself into the mood. I love these old Agatha Christie novels. Some of the attitudes and viewpoints expressed by the characters are shocking by today's standards. But then, I suppose we would shock them, too, if they could read our novels! Highly entertaining and an easy read.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was such an amazing &#34;stay on the edge of your seat&#34; movie.  In most movies, you usually don't cry until half way into it or at the end (happy or sad), but with The Impossible, I was crying within the first 20 minutes of the movie.  It was one of the most family-centered, touching movies I have seen in a long, long time.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I am a Tarantino fan, and this film delivered on every level that I have come to expect from QT.  The movie is a fantasy, of course, but it contains more grit and heartbreak than any antebellum era picture I have ever seen.  The language is offensive to the ear, but compromising in that respect would have been even more offensive to the history portrayed therein.  The violence is lightened by the humor, which is delivered by an astonishing cast of actors giving Oscar-worthy performances.  My only complaint--and the reason I gave this Blu-ray package 4 stars rather than 5--is the the paucity of bonus material contained on the disc.  There are no deleted scenes, and there is no director's cut.  I realize QT doesn't really believe in the director's cut concept, but I have read interviews where he discussed some of the material that was left on the cutting room floor.  For example, the Zoe Bell character is a total mystery.  Something could have been added to inform the audience who she was any why she wears a mask.  Likewise, some of the men in Candie's retinue needed a hint of back story to explain their prominence on his plantation.  If that didn't make it into the film, it would have made a nice bonus feature.  Overall, an excellent movie but not the best package of movie and features.
B004T340QY|4.0|This is a good movie.  Sometimes the southern accent is challenging, but it is really funny.<br />Four more words written (sorry).
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game was extremely fun in general, would've given five stars but it takes for ever to earn coins to buy things.

B009AMANBA|5.0|I've spent 25 years or more researching Abe and the War of the Rebellion.  I knew he wasn't the bumpkin his contemporaries assumed he was.  This film shows the political machinations that took place at Lincoln's behest in order to get the 13th Amendment to The Constitution passed.  However, politics aside, Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Abe in a masterful and fully believable way.  He was bright, tortured, savvy in the ways of politics and he was a family man.  For me, the most mesmerizing parts of the film are when Abe is being himself at home....allowing Willie and Tad to race around the table and wage little boy wars in Cabinet Meetings.  His interaction with Mary transfixed me.  The tension surrounding getting the votes for the Amendment was the overarching plot.  But the film showed us glimpses, vignettes of Abe's personal struggles and loves.  My suggestions for the producers' next film would be a study of Lincoln as a young lawyer, his periods of depression, his own God, and the story of the Lincoln family.  Mr. Day-Lewis brought Lincoln (warts and all) to life~~something we have never experienced.  I want more!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What a great history lesson woven into a novel. Can't wait for the final book in the trilogy. Hats off to Ken Follett!!

B007N85ZXY|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend who is a huge Neil Young fan. He said he absolutely loves this CD.<br /><br />If you're a Neil Young enthusiast then you know that he is ever-evolving musically. I had also purchased Neil's last CD which my BF was not as in love with. He says this CD is rockin'.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Best version ever in terms of voices.  I used to watch this all the time when it was on You Tube, then because of the new version they took this down so I bought it.  I was glad I had seen it on You Tube first though because I wouldn't have thought a filmed concert would be that great.  This exceeded my expectations.  It is amazing.

B001AKTZPK|5.0|I know I know,  picking the best Creedence album is like picking the best Michelangelo painting.  A virtually impossible task.  CCR's Willie And The Poor Boys is yet another flawless masterpiece in a string of masterpieces to be released by possibly the greatest American rock band that ever existed.  The band is incredibly tight on this record and Fogerty continues to impress with original and totally inspiring lyrical content.  There are different styles and moods to be heard on this LP.  Down On The Corner is probably the most recognizable track and opens the album.  John has commented about how he to defend Down On The Corner's upbeat poppy vibe.  It is now a staple in the bands vast catalog.  The second track, It came out of the Sky is a brilliant satire on an extraordinary event happening to an everyday man and the fame and eventual exploitation that ensues.  Its a rock and roll number that is deeper subjectivly than the upbeat groove would suggest.  Poorboy Shuffle is competent little ditty that is really just a precursor to what I believe to be Creedence Clearwater's best track ever to never be released as a single.  Feelin Blue Has an unbeleivably sweet groove that I just love to crank up on my stereo every time it comes on.  As if this album could not get any better, Fortunate Son comes pounding through the speakers.  Cliffords steady drum beat, Cooks chunky bass rumble and Fogertys Twangy guitar hook and suddenly an absolute hurricane of sheer Rock and Roll that is not only amazing to jam to but also has to be the most scathing indictment on the war that has ever been recorded.  Fortunate Son was a keen observation on the frustration of the times that is just as potent today. As political as this track is however, Fogerty felt a real disconnect with the whole hippie movement.  He is quoted as saying \\"There were things going on in the country that upset me, but having grown up in the hippie generation, there were a lot of things about my generation that upset me as well.  The song Don't Look Now was trying to address that.  It wasn't that I was a fence rider, it was just that some stuff was getting out of hand.\\"  don't look now is an old sounding country tune that calls out everyone who complained about the times but really didn't do anything to change them.  The midnight Special returns the album back to a lighter tone but is just as effective musically and lyrically.  A song like this is why I think John Fogerty is such an amazing storyteller and poet.  When he opens the track with that slow guitar strum and begins to wale what sounds like he's singing from a distance, \\"Weeeell you wake up in the morni'n, you hear the church bells ring,\\"  is so simple and yet so brilliant.  The song continues with all kinds of swampy southern imagery, \\"She come to see the Governor, she come to free her man.\\"  There were no other mainstream bands that were as compelling lyrically at the time.  Side of The Road comes next and is a throwback to Booker T insturmental jamming, (The band were huge fan's of Booker T and The MG's).  The album ends with the truly haunting song Effigy, the polar opposite of the albums bouncy feel good opener, Down On The Corner.  This one also has political undertones and is arguably the bands heaviest sound as far as atmosphere goes.  Fogerty shreds during his guitar solo at the end of this track.  This album is timeless and is a must for anyone who claims to love great Rock And Roll.
B003Y5H556|5.0|An impressive rendition of a classic tale. Well done, and scary/fun for those who enjoy the genre. Not for seven year olds. Put the kids to bed, pour the Merlot, slice the french bread and the Swiss and Cheddar cheeses, snuggle up and enjoy this with your favorite person. If you don't have a favorite person, enjoy it anyway, sleep with the lights on...Just kidding. Enjoy.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom was recommended to me by my friend Mary Beth. As she has always had exquisite taste, I knew this book would be a read I enjoyed. And it was.<br /><br />It was also a read that exhausted me, spent me emotionally. Life during the late 1700's and early 1800's was terribly hard, physically demanding, and racked with illnesses they could not treat. I found my heart pulled through my chest and drug through the same tobacco fields the people of the time period worked, caked and baked in sugar dust, doped with laudanum and laced with love. I cannot tell you it is a happy story, but I can tell you it is a shockingly true story. While not based in fact, but in fiction, the picture painted by Ms. Grissom is of details you simply know are true.<br /><br />The Kitchen House chronicles the journey of a young Irish girl, Lavinia, striped from her deceased parents and brought to America as an indentured servant. She is sent to live in the kitchen house with Belle (the Master's mixed daughter) and her family. Although she is white, as a child, she serves the house and the family as one of the slaves. [Side note: I was unaware of the amount of Irish people brought over to America to serve as slaves. I find this detail interesting and extremely thought provoking. Research will be done.]<br /><br />As Lavinia ages, because of her precocious nature, her wild red hair and her hazel eyes, she is given an opportunity to become educated, to live as a \\"white\\" person in Williamsburg with her Aunt and Uncle, by relation of the Master's wife. Her fortune proves to be good for her academically and socially, but Lavinia longs for her family, for Papa George and Mama Mae, for Belle, the twins she befriended as a child, and the babies she's helped raise - a myriad of mixed children forged via rape from the young Master's son, the field keeper Rankin (talk about a character that will disgust you!), and other white men looking to sow their wild oats.<br /><br />Throughout this painful, yet endearing novel, a story of tolerance, of struggle, of heartache, and of hope  pierces the reader's soul. It's historically accurate and fictionally sound. I loved the details, the history, and the characters, all drawn in real life accuracy.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is the kind of book that stays with you, with characters connected deep within the root of person, down to the very essence of humanity.<br /><br />A definite five stars. A must-read.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is Kathleen Grissom's first novel.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|The main character is very complex, clearly troubled but you are drawn to her, as concerned with solving her problems as you are with solving the obvious mystery.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|. . . and so does my mom. Once I saw the film, I knew she would enjoy its dark philosophical seam. She refused to screen it. I purchased it for her and left it on her counter. A few weeks later, I received a text from my mom, &#34;Batman Begins is AWESOME.&#34; My mom is 78. Although I own my own copy, I like to rent it when I am away from home and need to prove a point about the cinematography (which is AWESOME).

B0027BOL4G|5.0|My students screen this film as homework when we study food and the environment. I get a few new vegetarians every semester! A number of students even go on &#34;The Fast Food Diet&#34; where they eat NO fast food for a month. That usually cures them (and for economical as well as health reasons).<br /><br />Although some parts of the film are graphic (we now know what happens to day old &#34;boy&#34; chicks), its message is not &#34;in your face.&#34; Nor is it &#34;extreme veganism or else&#34; (in the opening scene, the narrator is having a huge burger and fries at a diner). It provides an honest exploration of the BUSINESS of food. It gives the viewer a clear picture of exactly where he or she is in this business model.

0765334798|5.0|I almost didn't read this one.  The reviews aren't quite as glowing as they are for some of Scalzi's other books.  That would have been a tragedy, as this book is my favorite by Scalzi.  There seem to be two camps of Scalzi readers: those who got into his work through Old Man's War, and those who got into him through Agent to the Stars, Fuzzy Nation, or The Androids Dream.  If you, like me, fall into the later camp (found Old Man's War underwhelming, and love quirky sci-fi), please don't skip Redshirts.<br /><br />For me, it was all about the codas.  I can't disagree more strongly with the people who didn't enjoy/read them.  The actual novel just felt like a set up for the codas, where all the really interesting questions about reality and meaning and purpose were actually raised.  Without the codas, it is a fun novel that plays with a silly gimmick.  With the codas, it's a touching, fun, thoughtful book that poses some odd questions.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me about this book was the title!  I really wish he hadn't called it Redshirts.  The joke about redshirts is pretty common in geeky circles, so I knew exactly what was \\"wrong\\" on the Intrepid from the beginning.  With a different title, I would have been able to enjoy that first surprise.  Fortunately that twist is not really the main one of the novel--the more interesting parts involve how Scalzi really fully explores the meaning and repercussions of this type of scenario.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|First a disclaimer: Even though I have written a vampire-themed novel based on traditional Balkan folklore descriptions of vampires, I deliberately put off reading \\"Dracula\\" out of a desire not to be influenced by Stoker's interpretation of the myth. Stoker's descriptions of 19th century Eastern Europe, i.e., Transylvania, Romania, Varna, seemed to ring largely true, and it seemed he had done some reading on the local folk traditions.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The plot of the book is quite a bit different from most films that bear the title \\"Dracula\\". Why? Probably because Stoker's ending is rather lame. The story gradually builds and builds and builds, and then they drive away a bunch of mangy gypsies from around a wagon and stake the Count in broad daylight in his casket. That's boring.<br /><br />Troubling Questions:<br /><br />How did Jonathan Harker escape from Castle Dracula? That was never made particularly clear?<br /><br />Why did Van Helsing have to import garlic flowers from Holland? The flowers don't repel vampires: the garlic itself does.<br /><br />I don't quite understand how the three sexy female vampires in see-through gossamer dresses fit in, other than to titillate the 19th century audience. And why did they stay in Transylvania? Why didn't they accompany Vlad to London? Certainly they would have wanted to do some shopping in Kensington or at Harrods. And wouldn't they have been jealous that Vlad was running around making new female vampires? Certainly they would have been powerful enough to leave Castle Dracula.<br /><br />Why did Vlad choose to travel by boat? Why not by train? He would have arrived everywhere far quicker and with greater ease. That illogicality is driven home at the end, when Van Helsing & Co., rush back to Transylvania and get there before Vlad, even though the Count had a healthy head start.<br /><br />If Vlad can walk around during the day, why didn't he rise from his earthen-filled box when the wagon was surrounded and try to defend himself. Certainly he wasn't that sound a sleeper.<br /><br />How could they kill Vlad by cutting his throat and impaling him in the heart with a Bowie knife? Everyone in Eastern Europe knows that impalement must be done with a stake made from a very specific type of wood. If you would like to know which type of wood, read my book Kiss of the Butterfly. <br /><br />Style:<br /><br />Stoker's style is difficult for many 21st century readers to follow. It appears that he never met a run-on sentence he didn't like, nor did he let grammar get in the way of his narrative. He is extremely wordy, and uses thirty or forty words when one would suffice. Although this style was sadly all too common at the time, Stoker is a particularly bad offender, even by Victorian standards. He uses the flowery politeness of genteel English upper and middle-class society until the reader is reduced to stupor. If one were to remove all the superfluous compliments, niceties, and praises sung to the virtues and nobility of the opposite sex, as well as completely inane references to how much each of Lucy's three suitors truly loved her and how she was the paragon of womanhood, then the novel \\"Dracula\\" becomes a short story.<br /><br />The characters are so busy being excessively polite and complimentary to each other, and so busy hiding trivialities from each other out of fear of offending someone that they fail to see the obvious, i.e., that something dreadful is happening to Lucy. I mean, come on, Lucy gets blood transfusions from four separate men, and they still haven't figured out that something unusual is going on?<br /><br />Mina is certainly my favorite character, as she is level-headed, practical, and usually seems to figure out what is going on before the others. She can also take shorthand and has all the train schedules memorized: what more could Jonathan Harker want from his bride? Van Helsing reminded me of two old professors of mine, but Stoker's attempt to write aDutch accent is so comically bad that it detracts from the story. Arthur, Quincy, John, and Jonathan all seemed like one-dimensional cardboard characters out of a Dan Brown novel. After a while I began cheering for Renfield, as this fly-eating weirdo was at least well-developed. The Count, too, also showed promise, although only as seen through the eyes of Dr. John Seward.<br /><br />Stoker tells the story entirely through diary entries, letters, telegrams, etc. This seems to work at first, until you realize that nobody puts that much information in a diary, unless they have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.<br /><br />Having said all that, I liked the book. It was a fun read, which is what matters.Dutch accent is so comically bad that it detracts from the story.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Such a sad remembrance of a time of turmoil. The accounts, although fictional, transport the reader into World War Two. Viewing the war from multiple perspective in a single book was really interesting. Maybe it's just me, but I found the time keeping methods odd. Overall a great read; I can't wait for the end of this trilogy.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|The first 25 minutes of the film sets it up for the action. We return to 1999 when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) ignores Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) a young genius in order to spend time with a conquest (Rebecca Hall). Years later a terrorist called Mandarin (Ben Kinsley) appears on TV. Meanwhile Tony is working on a device to call his suit to him. Stark comes under attack as the subplots collide.<br /><br />On the scale of films I rate this above the second feature, but below the first one and &#34;The Avengers.&#34; In this movie there are references to the Avengers, or &#34;super friends&#34; and the worm hole, but they don't play a role. There were lines in this film written for us older guys such as &#34;You like that West World?&#34; something even the hip youngsters might miss. Iron Man is aided by Don Cheadle and a kid from Tennessee (Ty Simpkins). I was also glad to see Gwyneth Paltrow's role expanded.<br /><br />A good one to see on the big screen and a must addition to my Avengers collection.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

B004FN16DS|3.0|As a huge protectionist, I believe in the American School of Economics. (Please wikipedia the American School of Economics) Our country was founded on Alexander Hamilton's beliefs of how our country would run The Federalist Papers, Report on the Subject of Manufactures. Now, I do have conservative views on most topics especially protecting our Second Amendment rights and other social issues, I do believe Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman screwed this country up with their so called free market economics. Ha-Joon explains that there isn't any such thing as a free market. People like me who love our guns though have been duped by politicians who have preached the free market. What does that mean?? If you produce in China, we as the US government will make it easier for you by not charging you tariffs. In fact, we will subsidize your corporation by giving you lower tax rates. I'm the type of guy who prefers it the way our country was in the 1970's. Yes, I love the muscle car era, and the reason the US manufacturing was so popular was because of protectionism.<br /><br />Now, the part I didn't like is when Ha Joon brings up Social Darwinism. I felt this had no place in the book, and pretty much advertised to a more liberal base. This is why I believe protectionism is seen as a liberal belief. Why couldn't he keep his political views out of it? This had nothing to do with protectionism.<br />Instead, I think he could have brought up the fact that a Democrat Bill Clinton was the cause for the demise of Haiti. Why didn't he?<br />Most people would be stumped by my prior statement about Haiti. Haiti is/was an independent country that was doing fine up until Clinton preached Milton Friedman's free market nonsense. BTW, I was a big supporter of Ross Perot at the time, and saw it coming. There isn't any possible way that a small under-developed country could compete with a heavily subsidized agricultural base like the US. Haiti was growing organic crops, while the US stole their base away with cheaper crops. The soil in Haiti then wasn't used and later became worthless, and Haiti then became dependent on the US. This is the recipe used around the word to create a global economy, or simply globalism. It makes me wonder why Ha-Joon didn't bring this up, but it was clear to me that Ha-KJoon is clearly to the left, which I felt showed bias, and took away from his objectivity.ir base away with cheaper crops.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|Wonderful!  If anything, watch it for the music.  The casting was quite good as well.  An excellent, excellent version of this story.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|This film makes the most sense if you appreciate it as a sort of \\"Showgirls of Ballet\\" (\\"Showgirls\\" as in the so bad it's good 90's film). It also makes sense if you think of all the female characters as spiteful drag queens.<br /><br />So, Natalie Portman does a good performance as a frail ballet dancer, who essentially has no life except for ballet and her overbearing stage mother with zero boundaries. She portrays a character who is on the verge of a breaking point at all times, physically, emotionally, mentally. Yet somehow - she is chosen for the lead in the \\"new\\" version of Swan Lake. The other dancers in the troupe are spiteful, competitive, undermining(because that's just how women are, right ?). The director of the ballet is a sexually harrassing cad - all the women know this yet it is implied that the other dancers will perform sexual favours to get ahead (again, those crazy women !).<br /><br />The film portrays all of this in such broad strokes : her bedroom is pink, full of child-like stuffed toys and ballerina artifacts. Her mother gave up an allegedly promising ballet career at the age of 28 (so old !) to have her. Her mother's color in the film is green - green like envy ! And the kitchen has wallpaper with a crawling ivy motif = symbolic ! And the ballet boss cad's office is all black and white - just like his apartment - full of mirrors, art like Rorschach tests, and more black and white. This is the way that we are to understand that he is a MODERN artistic man, who is very BLACK and WHITE in his thinking and behavior - and the film is all about that tortured white swan trying to find her erotic/demonic black swan.<br /><br />So all the women in this film are treacherous, undermining, spiteful, weak caricatures = this is a very tired way of imagining women's reality/experience. The notion of a lead ballerina being so tortured by her drive to perform/succeed that she is a weak, hallucinating, bulimic wreck is just so messed up. Ballet is incrediblyphysically taxing, and the people who succeed are driven and VERY STRONG. Try to imagine this film with all of the women's roles played by men, and it will be obvious how misogynist and stupid the plot/writing is. The part where she begins to dance her performance as the black swan, and feathers begin to poke through her skin is just laughable - as though she is growing werewolf like hair at puberty !<br /><br />The film is artistically shot, but this is undermined by the cliches that hold it down like cement boots.<br /><br />So wrong about ballet, mental illness, art, drive, female relationships. The \\"Mommy Dearest\\" of ballet films.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|my daughters aged 6 and 8 were thrilled to receive this game. They havent stopped playin since. Great product for kids.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This is Spielberg's best movie so far!! Yes, the central plot revolves around a horse, but it is the characters that really make this film so special. I originally thought that maybe it was based on a true story then I discovered that it was based on a London play.<br />WOW!! It would be interesting to see the play. If you're a fan of Spielberg's movies (E.T., Close Encounters, Jaws, Color Purple, etc.) as I am, don't miss this little gem!!
B003Y5H5C4|1.0|it just a really bad movie not saying it is not funny cause it is just written really bad and does not make you want to watch more
B000SW2F8K|2.0|Really lame movie.  No depth, not much character development, ridiculous story line and miscast actors all around.  Glad I didn't see this at the theater -- I would have wanted my money back.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It need less download time and more fighting and it like fruit ninja but ironman and it ok likely that it nice
B008JGSM6G|4.0|lots of levels with thefreeversion.  it's a fun game and not to hard.  I would get it again.<br />get this app
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|nice game.  not to slow to grow without cash. many options. fun. but you waste hours playing this game. not bad.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I didnt like this because after downloading it, I went in the app to start downloadint the videos it only let me watch them! I can do that on youtube!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is definitely worth the wait, it took awhile for it to download, but this game is so fun and i love the graphics!
B002SRQ214|4.0|This CPU absolutely kicks butt for the price and I would highly recommend it for anyone trying to build a gaming PC on a budget. It absolutely runs like a dream and have zero problems with the processor itself.<br /><br />I do have big problems with the stock fan. Once I installed everything and started running games I noticed that my computer was heating up WAY faster and hotter than with my previous 2.2 ghz processor playing games at the same settings as before. Needless to say I was a little confused. Over time my fan started to get loud. Like REALLY loud. I nicknamed it the banshee. I got sick of that really fast and got an aftermarket cooler and now it's quiet as a church mouse and is much cooler. Even so, the black edition does pump out a lot of heat so be wary of temperatures
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is great. It's like having your own town. Even if you don't  have a Facebook  it's still fun.
B00000F214|5.0|This movie has been out for a long time.  Still a great movie and worth adding to your collection.  These reviews should be shorter...
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I always enjoy  MPs writings. His detailed research and background is excellent.  Writing is so well done, intellectual w/out being dull or over my head.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This movie has been out for a long time.  Still a great movie and worth adding to your collection.  These reviews should be shorter...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The iron men 3 is a pretty cool game including exciting flying and killing enemy with very gorgeous looking 3D suits which is upgradable. But I was expecting this game to by some kind of fighting 1 vs. 1 game but turn out it wasn't. Overall, I still like it but the only error is it is pretty laggy. If there is Iron men 4 the game I hope there would be more upgradable level of power, HP, special or equipment for the suit. But it is good to deserve a 5 stars.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Its one of those books which I never tire of. Love the writing -the way it transports you to another world!
0785814531|5.0|I didn't expect this book to have all of the stories and poems for such a cheap price.  I love how it looks on my shelf.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Great, awesome, funny movie!<br /><br />Barbra n Seth were hilarious! I would recommend this movie to all my friends and family!
B008200LHW|4.0|I am a fan of Delorme maps.  I was really disappointed when I found out I had to purchase the BU-353-S4 separately for W8 because the BU-353 which comes with the mapping program will  not work with W8.  This seems silly to me.  I don't know if this is Delorme's fault or GlobalSat so I'm not giving them a 5th star for not working this issue out and passing it along to the customer.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|Love the whole album (are they called that anymore?)  I was blown away by Joe Bonamassa's guitar skills.  Beth Hart is an amazing singer.  You know when the music is SO GOOD that it gives you goose bumps.  This album is a goose bumper :D  LOVE IT!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is excellent for people who love horses. There is a variety of horses to buy. You can earn money and buy neat accessories for your horse and rider. This game is great for kids too.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm a little addicted at the time. love the color and matching type games. I've had no problems with my kindle fire and this app..
B005HED11Y|5.0|Even though you realize how the original series was sorta cheesy with the side effects, etc., it's still a classic and I did love it.
B008MM9630|4.0|I really really like this game. It's a lot of fun and great for my daughter. I'm quite addicted myself
B001CDD84Y|2.0|The whole idea of Jumper sounds great, but the way the movie was executed makes you wish you could get a do over.  The lead character is never likeable, and comes off as a control freak.  On top of that, I can't say I like Hayden Christensen.  I don't know, maybe it is Stars Wars fallout, but this guys just seems annoying.  Griffen was way more interesting, and likeable.  Samuel Jackson rocks as always.  Millie was cool too, but she could have been stronger character.  David treated her like crap.  Special effects were good.  Over all, Hayden, and the story, kills this movie.  Another cool idea for a story, f'd up by the people making the movie.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|This book offers a rare and fascinating look into North Korea and life in their prison camps. It is different to others as there is not the same level of propaganda. The inclusion of history and other facts make the read even more satisfying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEAT GAME EVER!! It's worth $6.99!! THIS IS THE SAME THING AS MINECRAFT ON THE COMPUTER!! ALL IT IS IS YOU CAN PLAY IT WHERE EVER YOU WANT!
B000FBJG04|5.0|You WILL enjoy this book. Obviously, you're interested in World War II, military history, and E company. More details than the video but still focused the personalities and experiences.<br /><br />The Kindle version has very uninspired formatting, bordering on annoying for headings...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!!  Buyer beware: It is highly addictive. I like that updates for the game include scenery changes and challenge differences. Mindless but fun.
0345505387|4.0|Nice artwork, good story. From the story we know from the novels, but fills in a few 'behind the scenes' details, as it were.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book was bound out with a whole section out of order - about 20 pages from later in the book, stuck near the front.. Amazon customer service (located in...?) didn't believe (or understand) me - they were convinced I'd misunderstood a memory sequence... which was NOT the case.<br /><br />Apparently, there are very few books printed with the giant balls-up... so I'm lucky, I guess :-/
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This one is added to one of my favorites ... I honestly don't understand any of the low reviews on this at all.  It's better than most of the movies released this past year.
B0015346OM|5.0|You'll enjoy this book too. Lots more details than the movie but the focus is still on the experiences of those involved in this story. With the movie in mind, it's very easy to visualize what the book is describing; occasionally though, the details differ and you can see where Hollywood went for drama over facts. A little bit of history to the conflict adds to understanding the situation.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Great movie
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Few words are needed. This is the BEST series I have come across in a very long time. Characters, story lines, could not be better. I could watch it again and again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am very pleased with this game. I don't have to be connected to the Internet to play. The down side is too many popups too often.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story. Unpredictable and thrilling. A unique twist on the age old idea of time travel. I am in fact a crying person and I cried during this reading. At first it's about saving Kennedy, but this book is really a spectacular love story told in a way only King can tell it.
1608871452|5.0|IT GOES THUR EVERY SEASON AND SHOWS YOU THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW. WITH A LOT OF EXTRAS AND FUN FACTS
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Mostly I love Alicia, and the character she has, and the way she struggles to be a good mom and a good wife.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Brandon Sanderson is my new favorite author. Looking forward to the stormlight series as well as more mistborn books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great end to the series. I really enjoyed finding out what happened to everyone. I think these books have a great storyline.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This video is great if you love music. The singing is terrific.  There is also a story line so it's not just music.<br />This would be great for the whole family
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series is addictive. The suspense, intrigue and twists keep you on your toes. We can hardly wait for one show to end to get to the next.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie really surprised me.  It was not at all what I was expecting - it was wonderful!  Having grown up in &#34;Lincoln Land&#34;, I've always been interested in any movie or book on the subject.  This was so well done it knocked my socks off.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I listened to audio book over a couple of months.  The story was so good that it was easy to pick back up anytime and reinvest interest.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I loved it.  And the ending?  They couldn't have done it better.  Very logical, very in line with the theme of the entire series.  Well done!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Well written characters who were complex, shaded and believably real people. Living in a universe that is a plausible extension of our current world. Loved This Show!
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|I was thrilled to watch this beautifully remastered DVD of one of my favorite John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movies.  I'm so happy to have it in my DVD collection.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|Very strange but entertaining movie.  I understand why it is a &#34;Cult Classic&#34;.  Definitely one that can be watched over and over.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to be released!  I watch it while working out on the treadmill and the time just flies by.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Loved this movie, it helped to wrap up stuff left hanging in the series. I wish they would bring the series back!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|You can slice the Zombies and pick your character. You can summon allies to help you defeat the Zombies and win.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the few books I have read where I really felt I got to know the main character and really liked him.  Humorous (laugh out loud at times) and touching at other moments, this book is intelligently and cleverly written.  You follow the saga of Mark Whatney, an astronaut left behind for dead on Mars, and cheer, laugh and cry at his struggle to survive as he awaits rescue.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|This movie itself is excellent and after watching the original I decided to purchase the video.  In most cases the best edition, whether book or video, is at the top of the list. Not in this case.  The video arrives in a envelope similar in appearance and consistency of a Hallmark card.  The disc is simply dropped in the envelope and allowed to slide around during shipping.  The clearly labeled Sony DVD was probably purchased at a local Wal-Mart and the title handwritten with a black marks-a-lot.  The aspect ration is very narrow giving it a pretty thin letter box view.  The content appears to be complete and the sound good, but this does not explain why this video is at the top of the list.  Contact Amazon to find the movie in its original packaging.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is PERFECT for a series! Love love love this book! I love things that are different and this is perfect for that! I never wanted to put my kindle down! If you're reading this, get this book! Don't just sit there and stare, GET THE BOOK!!!!!!!!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I watch Castle on television , I liked most of the scenes except the make out scenes.  The tv series is much better
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Very entertaining movie. Enjoyed every minute of it. Music and the dancing was great. I would recommend this movie everyone.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is very well done. Graphics are excellent. I've found myself playing for hours. The 6 y/o who this was originally for,  also loves playing this. We've figured out tho,  that the reason this app is free is because you do need to purchase extras to get further. I have to have spent $30 on this so far. If I had known that before downloading this, I probably wouldn't have bought this....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|By far the best game i ever played! Its so addicting . I meant to play for  a few minutes,then i ended up playing for a whole hour it is so much fun!!
B003GK21OE|4.0|King and Maxwell are great characters and featured in several books by Baldacci.  All of them are very good and I have read all of them twice.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|its just a flying game where you collect coins and shoot robots. totally not what I expected. I thought it would be like a shooter.
B00511QI4A|5.0|This book is fantastic and I have read it twice.  It has unlimited action and drama.  It has great characters and is a great story.  It is a page turner.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This is a great show. I just love Simon Baker in this show. I give it five stars. a great crime show.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Shouldn't have been surprised by nudity and orgies; was after all the story of Caligula..  ;)  Now I got to add a bunch of words to make this program accept my rating
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is a great movie. I just love christina ricci and rosie odonnell in this movie. I give it five stars. a great  movie.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Just an overall great imaginative movie, a lost art of the imagination. Recommend for any age and especially for adults.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I bought it for a Nikon mount/off brand lens that had a loose rear cap.  This on fits perfectly.  I recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My son and I are enjoying this game.<br />Fun to play for anyone.  Just the other day I was walking and was about to jump
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I followed the series on TV although it kind of went south in the last year or two.  I think the writers lacked a long-term story &#34;arc&#34;, if that's the right term, and were caught unprepared when it kept being renewed.  Anyway, it got more and more confused and bizarre and then they sort of dropped the &#34;other universe&#34; theme and turned the &#34;Observers&#34; into the occupiers.<br /><br />Since I didn't buy it, I can only assume Amazon has recognized my superior reviewing skills and that's why I've been asked to review it.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|Great conclusion to the two part movie. Gonna have to pick up the graphic novel and compare the two. A must watch if you like part 1.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Product arrived on time and in excellent shape. Brand new, wrapped, CD set with no issues when played.  Great example of British humor and John Cleese and troupe are in top form.  Saw these shorts on a trip to New Zealand and had to get my own copy.
0688014291|5.0|This book should be read by everyone, from Mom's to Executives.  Be a more efficient leader and lead your life in the direction you want it to go.  This book is the ultimate in working smarter and not harder.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My three year old grandson cannot get enough of Cars.  We have Cars and Cars 2, we have bed sheets, pillows, sneakers, flip flops, sandals, and a jacket.  The movie is just precious!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a very compelling book as it started in one area of the country and while most of it took place there; other parts of the country were also involved.  It was honest in a time where slavery was rampant and most people saw nothing wrong with it.<br />The characters were real and you coluld feel their hopes, dreams, pain and suffering.  How they chose to relieve this was different in each of them.<br />  I would reccommend this book to those who want a better feel for the South during this period.  You cannot finish the book without feel some loss on both sides and shame on past alliances.
1592332803|5.0|This is the fourth book I own by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau and it is a perfect example her love for animals as well as cooking. My family and I have been busy baking this weekend and enjoyed the peanut butter cookies, fall crisp and sugar cookies. As it is really difficult to purchase vegan baked goods in Australia, we decided to have a baking day each week to make treats for the week. Colleens recipes are healthful, tasty and support the vegan lifestyle. Many of the recipes are great adaptations of well loved classic recipes like choc chip cookies, making the transition to becoming a joyful vegan smooth and sweet. The book is also full of useful information regarding nutrition, animal rights and other tips on living a vegan lifestyle. As usual, her compassion shines through eloquently and I am glad to add this book to my library.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I think that we can all relate to this in some way.  We all have expectations of life and of ourselves to some degree and sometimes it is when we loosen up our preconceptions about ourselves that we find out the most about ourselves
0307743659|5.0|Read this first, then watch Kubrick's movie, then read the above book by Paul Whittington. Compare and contrast. Hey, did Paul take a class in Junior College English? Film? Was this his term paper or project?
B001LM1456|5.0|I watched this several time with my grandson. Great each time. He wears his Hulk gear when he mimics the green guy.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I have found Fifty Shades of Grey, although not very well written, has a reasonable story line, with enough 'hooks' to entice me find out what happens next.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Read this book over the course of two days because it was so much fun. Despite its length there is plenty of time to become attached to the characters. This is the first book I've read by Scalzi and I plan on reading more!
B00BD07SGU|4.0|Those who like Amorphis for at least their latest albums will surely like the new Circle album as well.<br />It offers nearly everything we know from the earlier stuff, so it's a nice follow upper on The Beginning Of Times.<br />No big chances in any sense.<br />The overall albumsound obviously feels heavier this time, thanks to the works of producer/deathmetalcrack Peter Tägtgren.<br />Well deserved credits on his account, especially for the fierce and upfronted guitars. Some brutal production!<br /><br />However, after the many listens I've had up until now I definitely enjoy their previous album much more. Songs as good as<br />Three Words, My Enemy or Mermaid are tough to beat to begin with. And I believe there's no such a song on Circle, although The Wanderer<br />comes close. Into The Abyss also one of the better songs.<br />Perhaps I will grow into it more in time. I hope so anyway.<br /><br />Still, in all, Amorphis will consolidate easily with this release. Way above average!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I went into this series not knowing anything about it. By the third episode I was hooked. The stories and characters were both serious and funny. There is some violence but nothing too harsh. The special effects are good and the acting I thought was also real good. For &#34;Castle&#34; fans, you will enjoy seeing the younger Nathan Fillion. I was sorry to find out that there was only one season to this program but glad that I watched it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I liked the fact that the weather channel app works at all. I have one of those Pandigital tablets and most of the apps don't seem to work on it very well if you can even get them to download. I didn't realize until after I bought it that it is a discontinued model so you can't even go to their site for help. Weather Channel works great though. Yay!!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|found it to be mostly faithful to Tolkeins book and the 3 d gives it an added kick.  Wish they would have started with it first.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I am a visual person -- and I love how well this app works as well as how nice it looks!!  That's key to me and calendars -- make it look nice!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Of course, Ellen is hilarious in this book and she talks about good life skills and how to be happy...watch her show if course! :) amazing!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|THE POP IN'S THAT COME FROM THE GAME DRIVE U NUTS. PLEASE LESSEN THEM. ALSO I WAS UP IN THE 200 RANGE N THE GAME WHEN I HAD TO REBOOT MY KINDLE FROM SCRATCH. THAT WAS AWFUL LOST EVERYTHING. HAD TO START FROM SCRATCH. THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED. WHY WORK THE GAME TO LOOSE IT ALL. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT HIGHER BUT WAS UPSET.
0060507772|4.0|Since it wasn't a true full length discworld novel it did feel a little rushed which is the only reason I'm not giving my normal 5 stars for this incredible series of books. However, the beautiful illustrations and oversized storybook style of the book almost make up for it. In this book we get to follow Cohen again and we also get to see Rincewind from the earliest books in the series. It's delightfully silly in how it's written and althought it doesn't progress the overall story in discworld it's a great side story which mocks the space program in a way only Pratchett can. Great!
B005KELQEU|1.0|This cover did not fit my Kindle. It was about an inch too short, no matter how hard I tried to zip it shut.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|The Clone Wars is an amazing series that takes place in the Star Wars universe between episodes 2 & 3 I believe. My husband loves it and I enjoy it too. The themes in the episodes are more adult and offer a much more in depth look at the characters in the universe. It's fantastic for any fan!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I loved this series and can't wait for the next season. I watched the entire 3 seasons in less than 3 days!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Such a new fandom to explore. I wish there would be more to add to this captivating world. I thoroughly enjoyed every word.
B00ATK02WM|5.0|This is a very well done version of  Les Miserables. Most of the details were correct according ot the novel and that made me happy as most of the details have not been done well in past films.
0374533555|5.0|Thinking, Fast, Slow by  Daniel Kahneman (Pulitzer Prize, winning author), is an incredible journey into the human mind.  How a human being thinks, acts, the psychology of decision-making.  Exceptional writing, research.  Daniel Kahneman (author) enlightens the reader about two systems that make up what is called \\"the machinery of the mind.\\"  System one: fast, emotional, subconscious.  System two: slow, thinking, not fast,conscious, logical.  Kahneman provides in depth research on how each thought process works, by documented experiments.  System 1: is the process of recognizing things and highlighting the unfamiliar with the familiar, like a grown man saying he his pregnant.  Expert intuition: that is fast thinking, in system one.  System 2, is different than system one has to do with structure, rules, computating.  If you asked to do a complex number times equation like 77 X 53 in you head, that when system 2 kicks in.  How an individual operates in regard to his/her monitoring of thoughts, actions, vocal vocabulary are all within system two manner of thinking.  The function that comes to mind in system two, does not allow for the individual to say, do, act on everything within their human mind.  System two, is very easy to access, it is automatic. OUTSTANDING CONTENT!<br /><br />Fun to read, incredibly insightful.  System one on the other hand, is not deliberate.  Much of the most fascinating activities in life are within what the author explains are system one activity, thinking.  It is very quick, automatic, the unconsciousness human mind at work.  You see someone but are not aware what cues you to recognize him/her, your shockingly surprise but unaware as too why.  Essentially, these two forms of how the human mind work, is explaining to the reader that each of us has two ways of making decision in life. Human decision making has very small window.  We focus on one thing at a time, not in line with what economics call rational economic choices.  The author, provided in depth analysis into both forms of human thinking, effects, so forth.  #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER, MILLIONS OF COPIES SOLD!<br /><br />Well-written, flowed well.  The second portion of the book after learning of this twofold nature of thinking, takes the reader into how human beings struggle with statistical analysis. Part one is the two systems.  Part two of the nonfiction book is biases, Heuristics.  Part three of the book deals with the topic of overconfidence in the mind.  Part four is more about choices.  The theories, context, time- tested experimentation, within the pages, involved: Anchoring, Availability, Substitution, Optimism and Loss Aversion, Framing, Sunk-Cost, Decision making, Happiness, Human Rational, Two Selves Framework. The nonfiction book highlighted - several decades of the most in depth, world renowned academic research, producing excellent insight, such as how the human mind has over confidence in daily human judgement.  Essentially, how the two systems' work in conjunction within daily life, psychological, economic parameters within daily society.  Thinking, Fast, Slow by Daniel Hahneman (Nobel Prize recipient) is an excellent nonfiction book, a must read for anyone interested in psychology, economics, and business.  The content of the nonfiction book produced in conjunction with Amos Tversky (author), is a discussion about how we think, how we use that information, and/or the ultimate result. Money well spent, it is incredible how much I learned reading this book.  Mostly, psychology, mixed with economics. The everyday mind in action in the world today! Unrivaled content. Recommended reading, for sure!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book,it was a good story, easy reading.I didn't want to put it down.I can recommended it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when I thought th he story couldn't get any better....<br />These books pull you right in ad hold on for dear life. A l treat it pulls at the heart strings. The bravery of these young souls who would risk their lives to free a  the districts from these terrible games that they have to send their children into every year. I can't wait to read the last one
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great place to find and organize ideas, content, favorites, recipes and more.  Craft ideas, repurposing ideas, cooking recipes.  Wish I could pin from Facebook
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This book is that first of its kind that I have read. I enjoyed each page, even if I did not grasp exactly how complex the plot was at the time. I picked up this book because it was assigned reading for a class. I now recommend it to people who enjoy good books.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's very educational (which is a plus over IAV). Who knew there were so many different kinds of coral! As a mom of a 7-year old I highly recommend it!!
B009VMN3RA|3.0|After reading this bio by Sachi Parker, I will never watch a Shirley MacLaine movie again. Talk about child abuse! Hats off to Ms Parker for moving forward with her life.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If your an iron man fan this game is for you. You can collect many gems and work on your iron man suit. You have weapons, specials, and HP. It reminds me of sonic the hedgehog where you weave in and out of obstacles trying to gather tokens but at the same time defeating the villains. There are some bosses like sonic the hedgehog and you will not be disappointed  best game I've gotten in a while.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My husband loves playing this game with me.  To make it challenging for two players we used blue painters tape to reduce the size of the board by two rounds,
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I absolutely love this film! Saw it twice during its theatrical run before seeing it on Amazon video. Though many short-sighted individuals have written this story off as &#34;just some fool getting himself killed,&#34; the plot and characters are much more complex than that. If you are familiar with the book, or otherwise familiar with the actual events, do not let that interfere with having such a rich cinematic experience.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  I had heard this middle one in the trilogy was not as good as the first or last, but I disagree though I haven't read the third yet.<br />The basic premise is so disturbing, but I am compelled by the characters and how they survive in this nightmare of a reality.  Imaginative, creative, and quite masterful really at the twists and turns and surprises.
B0091VTISO|1.0|Though I expected this to be bad, I thought it might be amusing trashy late-night fun. Ridiculously inept filmmaking. Unfortunately, there is not one scene that makes this worth watching (it should be noted that I fell asleep, but I feel certain that the scenes I did not stay awake for would have any positive effect on this review).
0375836675|5.0|I got a rave recommendation for Zusak's \\"The Book Thief\\"  but couldn't get it right away so I picked up this book. There aren't many novels that if read at the right time may give a new direction to your life, but this is one of them. It's about a young man with no ambition and a fatally low self-confidence who begins receiving mysterious messages and tasks in his mail box. His job is to unravel the messages and then do something about them. Intrigued, he begins to implement the tasks and as he succeeds in each one his confidence and enjoyment of life grow. Some of these tasks require courage and he is badly beaten a couple of times, but he soldiers on. But who is this mysterious person sending him these messages and how does he know so much about him? And why should he want to do this for an insignificant loser as our hero, Ed Kennedy, believes himself to be. The tasks lead Ed to a profound understanding and the author gives an unusual explanation on who the mystery person or persons were. I loved the ending, which kind of jerks you back into reality. Some readers wanted a more conventional explanation. But the author lets us know from the beginning, with an absurd though funny bank robbery, that we are in the realm of fantasy rather than realism. The publisher is marketing this book toward teens but I am a senior and I thoroughly enjoyed it. God bless Ed and his creator.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Since \\"28 Days Later\\" came out there has been a zombie renaissance that I expected to fizzle out several years ago. When this show aired, I was skeptical. Like many people, I thought, \\"haven't we milked this genre for what it's worth?\\" Apparently not. \\"Walking Dead\\" deals with the nuts & bolts of surviving the zombie apocalypse -especially the dangers of dealing with the living. With the exception of the sagging middle that was season 2, this show does not disappoint.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Got this for my son and he really likes it and play with it all the time.Nice product for him at 10.
1878424319|3.0|The problem I have with this book, and all in it's general is they are written for people with an IQ of twelve. The author repeats over and over again the same concept, even wording it similarly. This book should be 12 pages long. That being said, I think the info in it important.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Got this for my son and he really likes it and play with it all the time. Nice product for him at 10.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought this for my granson because he saw it on televison so I got this one for christmas for him and he love it.  Will buy the next one for his birthday.  It gives him something to look forward to.  Thanks
B004U52VPS|5.0|Got this for my 10 year old son and he play with it all the time. Nice product for kids.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My grandson loved it  and so did his mother they watch it together, so I will continue to get the rest.  Thanks
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This is a movie about a dysfunctional Philadelphia family. The family's son is sprung from a mental hospital too soon on a legal technicality and proceeds to become a menace to himself and others. His family is supportive but the genetic trail of dysfunction from his father is clear to see. After much flailing about the son finally connects with a needy new girlfriend and provides the only positive 5 minutes of this unpleasant film. Wish I'd spent my 4.99 on something else!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|I just saw Tom Keifer in concert last night with my son. I bought the CD after the show. Considering the age, this album is a refreshing change. Tom Keifer is a true musician who, in my opinion, cannot make a bad song. Sure, I prefer the harder edge of Cinderella, but as a solo album in this age of computer glossed mediocrity this among the best NEW albums (the entire CD) I've heard in a long time. This CD is highly recommended...as is his live performance (Outstanding!).
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was a very amazing book loved every page of it.. I was lost in th work of twilight and forks
B00B8WXEXO|4.0|Although I prefer the earlier music slightly better, this was a very solid album that easily stands well on its own. I listen to this album often and I look forward to the bands future releases. Definitely better than most of the blended trash passing for music these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun game for kids. It has lots of fun things that kids can do during the day. I love this game!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is inspirational, well thought out and speaks to all walks of life. The topics Sheryl discusses should be read by both men & women! I've already recommended it to two friends and will continue to do so!
0205191584|5.0|This book, recommended to me by my editor, is the single most important book you will read on writing. It has improved mine tremendously.<br /><br />My favorite line in this guide, which I believe to be the defining line, says, \\"This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.\\"<br /><br />Read it now.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|A good movie for what it is. Less action then was expected but still a good movie, I would watch again.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a fun infinite run game that nicely utilizes the Iron man character. Plenty of<br /> upgradeable armors and some cool boss fights make for a nice overall experience.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Great all around cast and story. I figured I would enjoy it and ended up find it better then expected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story is told with awesome detail. The characters are real and complex. Wish two main characters didn't die but I understand why they had to. Great ending that makes you want more.
B00BGIC170|5.0|Judd always makes everyday awkward into great movies. Helps having a great cast with the likes of Paul Rudd, watched it twice already.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the erotic scenes,but also loved the relationship of the two main characters. Grey was growing to know about himself and growing in knowing how to treat and love a woman not just as a sex object. I loved all three books, He didn't know that he had met his match.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Never been a huge fan of Tom Cruise but sometimes you can't deny even crazy people make the best actors/ actresses.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books twice. I loved the characters and the story line. Very erotic,but a good love story also. I loved the way the characters grew and changed and found out about themselves. I plan on reading them again!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The kind that adult or child can enjoy. Along the lines of Animated movies like The Incredibles, Brave, Nemo, How to Train Your Dragon and so on.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Anyone wanting a good love story will love this book. Erotic,but touching and love filled. Most readers will love this book.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a great app cause it brings me a lot of the TED conferences talks. The folks at TED are a gift for todays' thinkers
0446547638|5.0|I don't know how this author keeps coming up with these stories -- but they ARE great and this one is no exception.  The characters are so different and just \\"interesting\\".  I read this in one stormy, lazy Sunday and was so grateful I did not have to put it down until the end.  Highly recommend it.
B006RXQDH8|4.0|It's really weird, but it's a great movie. Definitely not for those who don't like a lot of blood. The swordfighting scenes are great, and a nice departure from Hollywood's usual gun battles. I like Volume 1 a lot better than Volume 2.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|To call Redshirts \\"fan fiction\\" is to insult all fan fiction.  Scalzi took a very cute idea and turned into something less than pleasing.  I guess that's appropriate since I feel he's more imitator than author, and much of his work copies Heinlein and Haldeman.  In my opinion, with Redshirts, Scalzi is paying tribute to Star Trek \\"writer\\", Brannon Braga.<br />Back in the 70s, Bantam released a collection of fan written Star Trek stories called \\"Star Trek: The New Voyages\\".  [[ASIN:0553246364 The New Voyages (Star Trek)]]<br />One of the stories, \\"Visit to a Weird Planet Revisited\\" by Ruth Berman explored a similar concept to Redshirts.  You can read that story for free here ([...]) and use the money you would have spent on Redshirts to buy some Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, John Ringo, John Hembry, David Weber, David Drake, Jerry Pournelle or some other legitimate writer of military science fiction.<br />On the plus side, there were a few cleaver ideas in the book,  but he never went anywhere with the ideas.  Like the teenage ticket scalper in \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\", Scalzi is very impressed with his own cleverness and expects us to be also.
B006SAR83I|2.0|Volume 2 is slow, with unimaginative backdrops. Volume 1 is just the opposite, with tons of action, and rich backdrops behind great action. It's weird how totally different the two movies are. Then again, it's Quentin Tarrantino, so who knows what to expect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome love it! Its really addicting once you get really good scores and when it statts challenging you with tbe speed
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show is so addictive and catchy. I didn't think I would like it at first since it was a high school show and I'm 22 but I loved it!
B009M1QRM8|4.0|.... though the whole concept/series is being strained.  Certainly an interesting development in wrapping up the whole Helen story.  On the negative side Agent Ps &#34;narrow escapes&#34; are really stratching the logic to new limits.<br /><br />Hence my minus a star...
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|Voices from a golden age and a reminder of the style in which Wagner was performed in the good old days. I love almost all of these performances but have particular affection for the Szell, Vinay, London, Varney,Harshaw Tannhauser and the Reiner, Schoeffler, De los Angeles, Hopf Meistersinger. One sad reminder if the good old days is how many deep cuts were made in Wagner's operas. I find it hard to believe that audiences would have had a difficult time sitting through uncut performances by these great artists. After all, we sit through uncut performances with less stellar casta today!
B003FC3LQK|4.0|i lke this movie warm and lots of dancing the stars are very good amovie that you can see many times
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|They killed off the most interesting characters, plus Lady Mary and the other one are so boring. It will be interesting to see how season 4 plays out. OH, and I hate the twirpy new young relative who is coming to live with them.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|If you're a fan of the Foo Fighters, it's essential that you see this film. Getting a look behind the scenes of this incredible band really brings them to life and makes them more real than you probably gave them credit for.
B009R659L8|5.0|Kept me engaged until the end.  Start trying to solve mid-BOOK, and am always surprised in the end.  Loved it!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|In my opinion the game was very short and thus not worth 2.99. IMO the storyline,graphics and mini puzzles did not add enough to the game to make it worth the price. I think adding an expert mode would be a good thing since the game is very simple and short. I like G5 game but this one was not my favorite. If G5 follows through and makes a sequel that would help raise my opinion of the game as too many things were left unexplained causing the player to think a chunk of the game got left out. So a nice game but nothing spectacular and far too short.
B009O07NDY|4.0|It's a gift to my daughter. She likes it. I'm not sure about the price is fair or not, anyway.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|This is hands down the worst album Michael Buble has ever released and I never thought i'd ever say that. Michael has released classic after classic, each album containing songs that give me goosebumps... such as \\"Cry me a River\\" , \\"I'm your Man\\" , and \\"Moondance\\" ... the crooner music that he's always done just suits him... It's obvious he's attempting to branch out to other genres (pop/rock and Motown) but it's honestly not working for him or his fans. I have been a hardcore Michael Buble fan for years since I was 14 years old (I'm 25 now.) I am just super disappointed with this album and it's the 1 Michael Buble album that won't be in my car playing over and over... I'll stick in the \\"Call me irresponsible\\" album and reminisce of the unbeatable 2007 tour. I will definitely be going to his 2013 tour, because I'm in love with his persona and stage presence, but this album is an absolute DUD and I can only hope that he'll do more old stuff rather then mostly new stuff.... 2 THUMBS DOWN.<br /><br />The only songs I can listen to on this album is \\"Come Dance with Me\\" ... \\"Young at Heart\\" .. \\"You Make Me Feel so Young\\" ... the other songs, i can't even tolerate.
B008MX7Z32|4.0|it is smaller than I expected, but nice one.I adore the possibility to charge from USB, but the plastic from which it was made is not really good
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I found Season 3 to be rather boring and, depending upon what happens in October, I might drop Walking Dead from my watch list.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is as good as free games get. It's an &quot;endless runner&quot; game, but it actually has a story line behind it. The best part is adding and upgrading your collection of iron man suits (which I recognized most of them from the movie.) GET THIS APP!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good suspense, easy read, and I enjoy the way the author`s writing style. It didn't end the way I had hoped, but overall a good read.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found this quite helpful, but it could have been a little simpler for a simpleton like me :) It describes very well indeed what the process is, even for someone as tech-illiterate as me, and has some very good, easy-to-follow steps. Buy it for your stable.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Easy to setup and easy to use.  Just make sure you are connected to WiFi unless you are on a good 4G conection if you want it to be usable.
B003GSLX5Y|5.0|Whenever I have a minute or two on the subway, I read a short portion of the book. It is an easy way to improve your writing skills which is so essential for business.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian is a character driven story of a non practising Jewish boy who looses his leg before WWI!<br />This loss impacts him personally and also ensures that he is not drafted for the war.  His mother Vera, a woman<br />who coddles her son and with a nervous disposition gets involved with a group of Jewish woman!<br /><br />Thus far the story seems clear does it not?  A boy-man with a leg lost a non-practising Jewish mother meeting up with kindred spirits... But your wrong. In essesance this book is about prophecies and personal beliefs that hinders and shape our characters in ways unexpected. Self-fulfilling prophecies makes Sebastian loose his girlfriend and unborn child?  His own family has little to do with this particular set of events but in their own way, with their own beliefs they set events in motion!<br /><br />Most of this book is about growth, and the ending was filled with hope!  I kept wondering if these peoples lives would have turned out better if their inner dialogues and belief systems were positive instead of paranoid and negative!  What I liked best?  The way the story made me think and the setting in Vienna that gave me a glimpse into unexplored territory for me.<br />WaAr
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Fascinating account of the couple years immediately preceding World War 2, with the Isolationists, led by Lindberg, tried to keep us out of the war raging in Europe; and the Interventionists, hesitantly and uncertainty led by Roosevelt, attempted to aid England.  The battle featured slander, co-operation, and accusations of both sides being unpatriotic.  A real eye-opener as to the angry divide in the U.S. before World War 2; and obvious parallels to today.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I just like this program because it is suspenseful and not a lot of sex and violence.  I like the main star. She is great.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book was ally terrific in helping me identify my target audience. Mr. Locke applies this to ebooks, but the process was easy to apply to my field of training, workshops and speeches in the mental health field. Clear, easy to absorb, and helps you stop flailing around by getting your material in front of the folks who want to buy it. I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Purchased this for my 8 year old daughter. She is having a great time with it. I like it because she can use her imagination.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I remember the original Footloose with Kevin Bacon when it was released in 1984. I saw it with a friend for my 12th birthday and Bacon was a brand new name back then.  This remake is a fresh update on a classic original and definitely worth the time to watch. Hough and Wormald do a wonderful job as the young teens; Quaid and McDowell are wonderful as the preacher and his wife. It's a rollicking good time!
B00BZODDYU|2.0|Not real scary, had some great potential though. Unfortunately the story wasnt enough to keep me engaged.  Kind of stupid ending.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show! The class structure, the toll of war on everyone, changing roles of &#34;ladies&#34; and &#34;lords&#34; . . . it's fascinating to watch. The acting is top notch. Dame Maggie is superb as the family matriarch, clinging to the old class structure while also being open to change for the sake of her family. There is a real sense of family between the upstairs and downstairs of Downton and watching the drama unfold is a wonderful journey.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|If you like Bejeweled Blitz, you'll like this too. This is a little quicker and faster though. You need quick reaction to get high scores. It's a good game to have.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very intriguing show I knew they were corrupt in Chicago and this just reinforces what I have believed all along.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|A clever take on when your wife takes the every day minutiae of your relationship... and turns it into tabloid fodder for her mass audience... and how you face up to the challenge.
0894803123|5.0|I bought a Cuisinart Ice Cream maker and this book... Wow! We can make ice cream at home now that is as good as any. If you have or are buying an ice cream maker, this book is a must!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a really good version for the kindle. Its not like the computer one completely but i think its fine, with how i use it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is one of the most enchanting pictures of human experience of both tragedy and hope sadness and joy. Also gives great insight into the War War 11 experiences of people on the Channel Islands. Wonderful story!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Helps feel in a lot what the move leaves out. I like this book. I'm going to trade the others
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Silver Linings is proof that with a sufficiently stellar cast you can still sell an utterly drek script. It is actually Painful to watch for the first 45 minutes as you see a marvelous assemblage of actors doing their best with truly aweful dialog and an equally poor plotline. One can only imagine how good it would have been if the inept producers had spent 1/10th the effort that the casting director did (the true unsung hero of this movie) finding an actual script.<br /><br />One wonders if this production was the result of a bet among the studio big wigs after indulging in too much wacky weed. I imagine the scenario as something like this:<br /><br />\\"You know, put the right stars in a movie and you can sell ANY story.\\" \\"Really...? How about a bi-polar loser straight out of a psyche ward after he messes up his otherwise sub-par life.... and we'll make him a self-absorbed jerk...\\" \\"Oooh!.... an Obsessive self absorbed jerk!\\" \\"Really? Does that even exis.... OK sure! why not?\\" \\"Then he bumps into a traumatized girl that will attach herself to the first loser she sees.....because this is about damaged people.... and that's how she's damaged...too contrived?\\"  \\"Who cares? Right! Cool!.... (pass that joint back here)... And let's see if we can get some of the Best names in the acting business and give them some seriously two dimensional characters to play just to see if they can salvage this mess.\\" \\"OK then! That's settled..... I think my 10th grader's available over the summer to write it..... or maybe David Lindelof...\\" \\"Hey! Time to cut you off dude! Let's not go Nuts here!\\"
B005UKJX4E|4.0|Terrence Malick in his mid-range offerings, is a noble failure.  &#34;Tree of Life&#34; is a beautifully created and operatic ode to life and loss, but is also a mess.  It is so wonderful, and so profound in many ways, but head-scratchingly, film-schooly, show-offy silly in almost an equal number of ways.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|My 10-year old could not put this one down. Another great read in the Percy Jackson series<br /><br />If you are looking for good Greek mythology type books for the younger reader try James Warburton's Jake Johnson And The Half Bloods (Quest 1) [[ASIN:B00A92YC2G Jake Johnson And The Half Bloods (Quest 1) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods)]] or its sequel Jake Johnson And The Journey To Olympus (Quest 2) [[ASIN:B00AR7MEWS Jake Johnson And The Journey To Olympus (Quest 2) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods) (Previously Published as \\"The God Of War\\")]]
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|In spite of some pretty dark ideas and frustrations in play, I don't think I've ever seen a happier movie. Jennifer Lawrence rocked it.
B0033807E0|5.0|Rick Riordan captivates his audience yet again in this book. My 9-year old could not put it down and we had to take it away from him at night or he would have read it all night long and forgotten to go to sleep!
B00BESM14U|4.0|It was a really, really, really well made movie. It had a great story, on the nose humor, and enough emotion to have you laughing and crying at the same time. All the actors were great. BUT, and this is probably a complaint that only I have, it seemed to sway too close to some issues while ignoring consequences and jumping over stuff. There comes a point where a movie isn't entertainment because it reflects too much reality, and that's where I found it. The dialogue was great, it just scraped on over some real issues people face when it could have embraced them head on. It seemed the issues were fairly one-dimensional (with one HUGE exception) despite the billion dimensions of characters.
142312166X|1.0|Most of us will look at the Title of the book and the author. Nowhere on the front cover does it say anything about short stories or interviews. When you are up to book 4 or 5 in the series, you don't look carefully at the book description anymore. A few words on the front cover alerting the reader to the fact that Rick Riordan was doing something different here, would have been more honest.<br /><br />Some Percy Jackson fans will no doubt enjoy this book as long as they are aware before buying that despite the LARGE words PERCY JACKSON on the front cover, this is not a traditional Percy Jackson novel in the style that we all know and love.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|What can I say? It charmed me. It seemed quirky just for quirkiness sake and had an infectious rhythm throughout. I liked it a lot, but I'm not sure who I could suggest this to. Eh, it was pretty fun anyways.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|My 10-year old took a little bit of time to get into this one (after reading all the Percy Jacksons), but soon could not put it down and begged me to buy the next in the series as soon as he had finished this one! He enjoyed it so much, that it even inspired him to do a project at school based on Egyptian mythology!<br /><br />If you are looking for good Greek mythology type books for the younger reader try James Warburton's Jake Johnson And The Half Bloods (Quest 1) [[ASIN:B00A92YC2G Jake Johnson And The Half Bloods (Quest 1) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods)]] or its sequel Jake Johnson And The Journey To Olympus (Quest 2) [[ASIN:B00AR7MEWS Jake Johnson And The Journey To Olympus (Quest 2) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods) (Previously Published as \\"The God Of War\\")]]
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I got hooked immediately on this.  I began my job at Boeing in 62 and can totally relate to the attitudes.  Had forgotten certain things but, this show reminded me of male chauvenism at its finest.

B00AA0U05A|5.0|I saw Emmy on The View and liked her style.  I would buy another of her recordings.  I keep looking for them.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A somewhat different take on the standard post-apocalypse movie in which the victims are also the bad guys. A little cheesy but very well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun and addicting. I have played and could never put it down. I loved how you can connect it to Facebook and go against your friends. I love it a lot. &lt;3
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Very funny, timeless, superb script and acting - I never guessed that Hook was Dustin Hoffman until I saw the credits.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this version of Jane Austen's novel. I only wish it was longer and included more scenes, but it moves quickly enough that you can't get bored. This one and the BBC version are tied for my favorite.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I'll skip the plot review, since those are easy to find.  This movie is absolutely fabulous (girl power!), and I love that it focuses on a girl and her mom learning to appreciate each other's strengths, rather than her physical appearance or need to find a guy.  Plus, it's filled with Scottish accents and Celtic music/legends, which are both enchanting.  This film might be a bit scary for younger viewers, but it's a great family movie!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful graphics and interesting challenges. Easy to earn enough perks to add characters and landscape to your reef without having to &quot;buy&quot; anything.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This book had an interesting premise--death by poisoned cupcakes--but I have to deduct a couple stars. The characters were likable, and the plot was fast-paced and somewhat predictable, making this a great quick read for travel or an afternoon by the pool. However, this book features some of the worst editing I've encountered in a long time. When books get &#34;kindle-ized,&#34; there's usually a few typos or formatting glitches. I cut the authors some slack because I know they don't have any control over those glitches, and even the best editor misses a mistake occasionally. This book goes way beyond that, though. We're talking multiple mistakes in the same sentence, misuse of words (e.g., &#34;to&#34; instead of &#34;too&#34;), an obscene number of run-ons, and a complete lack of understanding of apostrophe usage. Poor grammar (especially in something professionally published) is one of my pet peeves, so I found the errors to be distracting. That being said, if grammar mistakes don't bother you, and you're looking for something light and fluffy (think Hallmark movie), this book is probably worth trying.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am a confirmed Sherlock Holmes aficionado. This book let's me have my fix whenever I need it. Well done!
B005HSL626|4.0|I really liked the app it had lots of bonuses . I liked that you did not have to pay for things, you got earn money in the app.

B001TH16DI|5.0|A great collection of the original movies in hi definition glory! great quality with the restorations the dts master audio is devine
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really don't like rating this book when I couldn't even get past the 3rd chapter.  My sister recommended this book as a great read...said she couldn't put it down.  I had no problem putting it down and moving on to other books.
B001KZG99A|5.0|My kids and I look forward to watching the Iron man movies with Robert Downey Jr!! We rented the first one again to refresh ourselves befor seeing the third one!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a fairly entertaining book incoporating a lot of basic science about living on Mars.  I found the style entertaining and the occassional jokes hilarious.  Modern aspects of being stranded on Mars were also smartly included in the book.  It also isn't too deep; there isn't any self-exploration of the inner psyche.  Just the straight forward portrayal of somone stranded on Mars.  The price was right also at 99 cents!
B005LAIGWS|3.0|Because of the so-so origin film, I went into the sequel expecting the worst and while not a great film, it's an improvement over the first one. With a little more humor and over the top action, this Ghost Rider is at least more fun and the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sound great adding to the enjoyment and the supplements are OK. If you're a Ghost Rider fan, this is a step in the right direction and should appeal to fans who aren't expecting Spider Man/ Iron Man quality films. Fans of the first one seem to hate this one and vice versa, still there is a great Ghost Rider film to made and neither of the films are it. ..at least they didn't release two versions of the film on separate releases with this film.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|This movie has it all. Sci fi, comedy, action, a little romance (although one sided because of Kirks ego). This is one of the better scripts these Star Trek films ever had. That in turn was very well directed and performed. The cast here all shines with each one getting memorable lines and performances. Loved it!
B001DRF84W|3.0|Going back over some Marvel films that I saw in a theater that I've seen on home video a few times now. When I went to see this film I wanted to love it, but ended up a little disappointed. The story is interesting enough, but the film's pacing is uneven. It captures some of the feel of the comic book and the CGI Hulk looks good most of the time and while I didn't mind the Hulk being CGI, I didn't like a lot of the changes in the original story.<br /><br />Changing Dr. Banner from a meek book worm into a troubled anger management patient was not the wisest decision. There was no contrast between the two personalities and this could have been used to there advantage throughout the film. I also felt the story was a bit convoluted and long sometimes even tedious. Making the hulk grow to 15 feet was also a bad decision, it made it even harder to believe those purple pants could stretch so much and where does it end if he keeps getting madder, will he become a 500 foot Godzilla Hulk?. When the Hulk is on screen, the film is exciting and full of great Hulk action. i.e. a favorite scene, the desert when The Hulk is running towards the tank! Hulk dogs, his father is a quasi Absorbing Man?, all of this seems to be thrown together, but I didn't hate this movie.<br /><br />In the end, while I liked this film, it left a lot of room for improvement. There was enough going for me to overlook some of the flaws, but this could have been a really good movie with a few tweaks here and there.<br /><br />I had envisioned a movie like the original Frankenstein or King Kong with a misunderstood monster that just wanted to be left alone, the sequel, is an improvement, but that is another review.<br /><br />The 2 disc DVD is nice with some interesting extras, but the Blu Ray is the way to go for video and audio for best film experience.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game because you never know what is in the mystery boxes when you get one.  I also like how you can change characters.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Who would have thought? One of Marvel's more difficult challenges to bring to the live action film turns out to be their best effort since the first Iron Man film. I know purist will have a hard time with Dr. Donald Blake not being anymore than a name and nothing to do with the God of Thunder here, but with the way this film ended, I can see an interesting way to introduce him as he should be.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Now that the bridge from Asgard to Earth has been destroyed, maybe the only way for Thor to return to earth is to project his being into a earthling who is worthy? and that someone will need a a certain item to conjure up the Norse God.(a staff maybe?) It would be nice if they could introduce Blake as Thor's alter ego to add some dimension to the role and give \\"old goldilocks\\" a breather.<br /><br />******END OF SPOILER******<br /><br />Now on to the film, it works! Mainly because the three H's (main actors) are exceptional in their roles. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins are completely committed to their roles and they pull off what could have been a disaster. Portman is also very good, but I didn't feel she was irreplaceable, though quite nice to look at, she isn't given as much to do as she could have been if Thor's alter ego was involved.<br /><br />The action scenes are big and believable as well as Asgard's design. The action is a little too sparse for my taste, but Thor's Mjolnir his impressive weapon of choice is pretty great, seeing some of its signature uses i.e. the helicopter spinning hammer, conjuring lightning etc.<br /><br />Hemsworth seems born for the role and followed through in The Avengers movie.. I can't wait for Thor's sequel to hit theaters.<br />Thor isn't perfect, but it is everything it needs to be and more. It is one of the most entertaining comic book films of all time. I saw this at IMAX in 3-D and it looked great, I'm not completely sold on 3-D, but it has improved a great deal.<br /><br />The 3 disc Blu Ray/3D, DVD looks and sounds great with some interesting extras.Blu Ray/3D, DVD looks and sounds great with some interesting extras.

B000OVLBIU|2.0|Being a huge Marvel comics fan from the 60's through 70's, it is really disappointing for me to see such a great comic hero get such a mediocre movie. The FX's are cool but the story is confusing and tedious. Cage and Co. are bland and don't appear too interested in what they're doing. It's not terrible but it's far from great. The extended edition is an improvement, but this could have been a better film.<br /><br />Why did Ghost Rider get two films and Daredevil just one? The Daredevil movie is better than either of the two Ghost Rider flicks?<br /><br />The bigger slap in the face is that they didn't include both the theatrical and extended cut on one DVD/Blu Ray set. The Blu Ray looks and sounds very good, but which version to buy?<br /><br />Since I found both in the $5.00 bargin bin I bought both, but is it worth it? That depends on how much you want to own this film. If I were going with one I would go with the extended version, but there are more extras on the theatrical. It's bad enough they make mediocre films, but to try to make more money from fans by releasing two versions separately is just ridiculous and greedy. The Blu Ray version does have some extra stuff not on the DVD. My rating is 2 1/2 stars for the film with a 1/2 star deducted for the cheap trick they pulled with the two separate releases.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is the best compound invented. You don't need much for CPUs this stuff sticks like cement. I'd recommend this for everybody.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I never read the original Captain America comic from the 40's, but considering this is the first of at least two films for \\"Cap\\" I think it was handled very well. Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies. It's a little light on \\"Cap\\" action, but origins usually are. The story is pretty easy to follow and the  Red Skull the perfect choice for the villain. Excellent FX  and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans. Also sets up The Avenger's film with Thor, Iron Man and The Hulk films.<br /><br />The three disc 3-D/Blu Ray/DVD combo is loaded with good bonus stuff and an excellent looking Blu Ray transfer.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I'm not a sci-fi fan, but even I liked this (my husband bought it). We saw it in the theater, but it plays well at home, even on a 32&#34; screen.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|This film was not too well received by critic and fans when released in theaters, but I liked the theatrical released of Daredevil. It wasn't as gritty and violent as I thought it should be, but it was pretty solid adaption of the comic book character especially if you go back to the early years of the comic book. Ben Affleck ..well I'm not a hater, but he's isn't the greatest actor, but I don't find him nearly as horrible as a lot of people do.Now that there have been misfires for The Hulk, Electra  and Ghost Rider etc., this film grows on you and the addition of a director's cut enhances the viewing pleasure a great deal.<br /><br />The extras on the theatrical release are worth the purchase alone and now with the Director's Cut we get a much improved version of the film, plus a whole new bounty of extra material. It appears that the Blu Ray of the Director's Cut has carried over all the extras from the Director's Cut DVD (for once!), but I'm not positive about that. If so, keep the theatrical cut for the extra material and to revisit the theatrical release once and a while and buy the Blu Ray Director's Cut for the superior version and the new extra material. If you don't own any versions of this film and are thinking of buying this movie, buy the Director's Cut. This version really improves on the rushed feeling and sometimes hard to follow theatrical version.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love Daniel Craig as Bond, more than any other.  Used to fall asleep when my husband would watch these but not with him!  Good movie, too!
B001DHXT2A|4.0|While I didn't hate the first Hulk film there was plenty of room for improvement. Ed Norton is better suited for the role of Banner, but still not quite right in my opinion.....especially now after seeing Ruffalo's take on the character (NUFF SAID!)  This is a quasi sequel to the first film  so we don't get an origin story, but an already in progress Hulk story. Which is probably a good thing since the films are only 4 or 5 years apart. Hulk CGI is better this time and we get to see some new signature moves from Hulk like the super clap!, gone are the 3 mile jumps and Hulk dogs, replaced by a much better foe The Abomination!<br /><br />The Hulk is still to large for my taste, ......The Hulk in The Avengers proved that and has set a new bar for Hulk standards. This is an improvement and worthy installment especially as a lead in for The Avengers and solo outings for the group. The 3 disc DVD edition is sweet, but the Blu Ray has better video and audio.
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|Wow! One of the cleaninest blu-rays i've seen to date (of an older film being reissued from the master copy).  i already loved this movie, but now somehow i love it even more!  The upgrade sound and picture quality thoroughly enhanced its pleasure.  Who do i contact to get more films done like this?
B002ZG9846|5.0|I had wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer a few years ago. What looked to be just another \\"by the numbers\\" comedy turned out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.<br /><br />This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for children, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.<br /><br />As far as the violence involving the young actress who plays Hit Girl, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic and serious, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.<br /><br />There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.<br /><br />Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays \\"Red Mist\\" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as \\"Big Daddy\\" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. \\"Hit Girl\\" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.<br /><br />While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.<br /><br />In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!he wants to fight crime.

B00CDT41RY|4.0|Packed with stars (who don't last long enough sometimes) great story, lots of gore...yep it's a Quentin Tarentino film! I admit I am a &#34;star&#34; gazer and this movie is peppered with actors that have been around awhile. The plot requires that they have limited screen time but because it moves quickly you don't get bogged down in the whole, &#34;wasn't he in such and such&#34; exercise that so often detracts from the rest of the movie.<br />It was also very nice to catch a look at Tom Savini, (special effects make-up artist). He is such a hottie and is a master of make-up and I truly admire his work and his acting shots.<br />I love period pieces and this one didn't disappoint. Costumes and sets were really good.<br />Christopher Waltz played his role with humor and energy and Jamie Fox? Awesome as ever.<br />Check it out!

B005FITIGO|4.0|This movie was interesting to me from the beginning.  May not be your thing if business, stocks and cover ups don't interest you, but I enjoyed it.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Loved the story but the jumping around so much kind of annoyed me, plus the author uses so many words I had to look up that it became a bit of a chore.  Also lots of words that aren't in the New American Oxford dictionary.<br /><br />But the book makes me eager to see the feature film.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|Just couldn't get into it. I really can't say why I ordered it.  The trailer looked really interesting, but after seeing the movie I would have to say that I just didn't care for it personally.

B00000D9TQ|3.0|Like Sting, PC's solo music has aged far less kindly than his group work with Genesis.  I bought his first album, Face Value, when it came out and really liked it (I still do).  After that he was a constant presence on the radio in the 80s but that material never grabbed me so I never bought any of the subsequent albums.  Finally I saw this on sale for $4.99 last week and thought \\"why not\\"?  Honestly, most of this music is pretty banal. In The Air Tonight is by far the best song.  Take Me Home is very good but it sounds so much like Genesis that you have to wonder what's the point of doing solo work.  If you were to purchase only one PC album, I would strongly recommend Face Value over this hits package.  It had only one hit on it but the album was terrific from start to finish.  This one just isn't.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|Audio was very poor and thus could not enjoy the movie. Good performance by De Niro and other actors. not good.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Just when you're ready to give up on the state of popular music, a band like Alabama Shakes comes along. Performances on SNL and the Grammys made sure that this band's popularity would bust wide open.  It was with some trepidation that I played the CD for the first time.  Was this going to be just another band that had two great songs but not much else?  One listen was enough to get an answer:  Clearly not.  To these ears, the best thing to come out of the south since Kings Of Leon.  In fact, if Janis Joplin were the lead singer for Kings Of Leon, that could be pretty close to the sound of Alabama Shakes.<br /><br />For some reason, when female singers front a band, most of the attention is on the singer.  Britany Howard is terrific but, make no mistake, this is a real band, a very tight band.  This is one of those rare must-have CDs that still finds a way to get made.

B0091QSNEE|2.0|This is a fantastic concept but unfortunately it's technical issues are too frustrating to get past. In all Dr Panda apps you click on the characters to open up their specific game- or what they need (from groceries in one app to a nail trim in another). All other apps work just fine- just not this one:(<br />When you tap a character, it's only going to work about 1 out of 15 times- SO FRUSTRATING. My poor 3 year old taps and taps and taps and then finally gets so upset that she has a meltdown.  I tried to delete in and reinstall it hoping that would fix it but it must be in the app itself since we don't have any issues with anything else.<br />I've had to delete it permanently.<br />Don't waste your money on this one. Go with Dr Panda's Hospital, Dr. Panda's Beauty Salon, Dr. Panda's Supermarket... those are the BEST :)

The plot is mundane--rich guy hitting on the servant girl, the trials of Welsh miners, and I perceive the beginning of WWI.  I am not even sure I'll finish it because I have endured through the first half and nothing is improving or gripping my interest.  Frankly, I'm bored and I have a lot of other books I'd rather read.  Too bad.  He is generally an excellent author and perhaps if I had nothing else to do, I'd read it, but----.

0062183591|5.0|This is a great book whose author took the time to do studies of how normal people reacted ethically under certain conditions where they were solving problems and being rewarded monetarily for the results. Many different scenarios were set up to see what level of dishonesty would occur with different variables mixed in.<br /><br />What they author uncovered was very interesting. It was very rare for any test subject to just go all out and cheat completely under any condition so full blown criminals are rare (or at least in university test settings). Also the game theory of people just doing what was in their best interest when they had no chance of being caught was not found to be true. What did seem to happen was that test subjects wanted to cheat enough to get a little edge over what they deserved but not enough to feel bad about themselves.<br /><br />The amount of money that could be won and the probability of being caught did not inspire more cheating surprisingly. This is not what the researchers expected.<br /><br />Making test subjects take a pledge of honesty, sign their name, giving moral reminders, and direct supervision did decrease dishonesty.<br /><br />The biggest drivers of dishonesty discovered in the research studies were that dishonest people had the the ability to rationalize what they did. Conflicts of interest drove dishonesty in many professions when monetary gain was at stake.<br />Dishonest people were more creative.<br />One immoral act was dangerous and could lead to a waterfall of dishonesty with the 'what the hell effect'.<br />Being exhausted lead to bad decisions about dishonesty and health.<br />People actually increased cheating when others were helped by it, 'The Robin Hood effect'.<br />Watching others be dishonest increased dishonesty of the employees,peers, or audience.<br />When people in high places are seen to be dishonest it has a cascading effect down to everyone else.<br /><br />This is one of those great books that you will learn from and can change the way you look at the world. The book tells the story of why the above principles are true.If you are curious about the underpinnings of morality you will find this book informative and interesting.l learn from and can change the way you look at the world.

B006FE83UE|5.0|Excellent in every fashion.  An all time American Classic movie for all to see.  Clearly one of the best movies every made.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I  intensely love puzzle games and am often disappointed that I spent money on one. LOVED this one though. I wish it was longer and I wish it wasn't their introductory game because I want more!! Beautiful, challenging, wonderfully creepy at times, and just a creative, independent theme.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|reads smooth, no issues and would recommend this to others to use. If you need a great reader, then get this app
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is very fun and addictive. The graphics are amazing and the new effects like the mine are awesome. I`m hoping that imangi studios makes an even better version than this one. (though that will probably be very hard to do.)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it was awesome other than making u pay to finish or see the end....wow.just.wow<br />id love to see the ending..trick to spend money.smh
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the game and the rewards u can earn after and the mystery part of the game and the title.
084313335X|5.0|I grew up on these books , so when my preschooler became interested in them I was so excited! I love them!
B008458O3S|5.0|Good learning curve, and interesting puzzle design. My only minor gripe was that only the last two levels really took some time to solve.  A lot harder than the generic &quot;Cut The Rope&quot; style games,  though. Great game.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|This is how I see this book, I liked it but not as much as I liked The Selection. I gave the 1st book 4 stars so The Elite gets 3 stars. I even liked the novella, The Prince, more. I was really irritated that America and Maxon did not have a real conversation about their relationship and their feelings towards each other until 88% into the book! I'm a Prince Maxon fan all the way so I didn't care what was happening between Aspen and America, even though not a lot happened with their relationship either. I almost feel like The Elite was a book meant to stretch this series into a trilogy when the story could have been completed in two books. I will still read the third book, The One, to see how the story ends.
0810970686|5.0|My grandsons really enjoy these books and having their own copies makes it even better.  The writer definitely appeals to kids.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|The best movie I have watched recently. 6 stories. Past, present, future. Drama, action, comedy. Frigates and space ships. Rock climbing. Philosophy. Reincarnation. Cannibals and Matrix-like guys. All in one. \\"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\\"
B008220C38|1.0|I have been a fan of Tolstoy's literature since I was young.  I've read the book &#34;Anna Karenina&#34; several times and loved it each and every time.  When the movie came out I was elated at the prospect of watching, rather than just reading, a fine piece of literature. Wrong!!!!  The movie is piecemeal, and it does not quite follow the book. Its lavishness is lost through scenes that seem put together out of sequence. The movie is made as a theatrical play and lacks the depth of the story as depicted in the book. In many aspects of it, the movie fails to grasp the nature of its heroine, the drama of her self-inflicted dilemma, and the hurt and upheaval caused in the lives of others close to her by her selfish decision. In the movie, Anna is portrayed as a &#34;victim&#34; not as a woman who lacks moral character that leads her to the poor choice of choosing a sexual relationship over love of family. Her lover, after a while gets tired of her incessant moodiness, does not care about the child conceived, and, as this type of relationships usually go, the lust dies down. Her suicide is an act of revenge as well as a desperate &#34;out&#34; for a woman who lost it all (reputation, security, social status, family),to the ill-conceived idealism that choices have no consequences. I love the book. I absolutely hated the movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I do NOT normally play ANY  games however, this game rocks. Do not like the ads that pop up between games.....
B005ER6STG|3.0|I was draw toward this film because of the hype I had read about its contents.  A number of reviewers cautioned against getting a cut version if you wanted the full effect of the original.  I guess I goofed going for a lower-priced DVD.  This film does hav its moments but it's a bit difficult to grasp the context of everything.  Perhaps the truly uncut versin would plug those gaps.
B00992CF6W|4.0|In the game mode you can't sleep and there are beds, the weather doesn't change, and there are no animals in the game and in the survival mode you have to get all the blocks ,build beds ,chest and different things but, if you die you lose all your work in the game and have to restart.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|The quintessential definition of &#34;turn-about is fair play&#34;.  Well cast, well acted, great cinematography.  Keeps you engrossed from start to end.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was great! I think anyone could read it now  I need more words to submit it so I'm just going to type a I in it is
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use the iPad mainly in educational settings, writing/drawing apps for little kids. This is the perfect size, feel, and nonfussy/indestructible design for use by very young kids and other sticky fingered types prone to clumsiness (me). I've only had this a few days, but am already a huge fan.<br /><br />Ease of use was my number one concern in picking out a stylus. It shouldn't be harder to use than your finger. The cosmonaut can actually be EASIER and more reliably registered on the iPad touch screen, at least for my 1st gen oldish iPad whose screen has seen a lot of wear and tear and for the kids I happen to work with, whose fingers can be less than spic and span. Less pressure is required than when using a real life crayon or pencil, and movement is smooth and effortless! Very pleased so far, though time will tell if it breaks or not...
B007N8RULO|5.0|thought this would be simple and as mindless as regular solitaire....no way.  So Much fun and helps to keep me sharp
B008N9AASC|3.0|Ok but not as good as baraka. I think I was expecting a more visual presentation and something that captured a lot more places. For someone who hasnt travelled then I think it probably would be very interesting. One needs to view for oneself to judge this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The different games that have been made for subway surfers are cool!!!!!!!!! I love it. I hope they make many more
B001CDLAT4|4.0|Found this by mistake but really think everyone should take time out to sit and view it. It has beautiful nature views and very creatively mastered.
0446572985|5.0|Excellent suspense, I had trouble putting it down.  A hit man with a conscience and empathy towards those in trouble or in need of help.  I read 2/3rds of the book in one day and had to force myself to stop to do other things.  David Baldacci's new character has flaws that make him not a hero but more a rescuer of those in need.
1592332803|5.0|The Joy of Vegan Baking has saved my baking life. I've been a baker my entire life, but over the last few years as I've steadily worked at improving my diet, cutting out meat, then dairy milk and eggs, I kept trying to substitute out the ingredients in my old recipes and it just wasn't working. I've always loved baking, and it was getting depressing not being able to make decent cookies, cakes or pie crusts anymore. I didn't want to resign myself to a life of granola bars for dessert. Thankfully I was directed to Colleen Patrick Goudreau's podcast by a Facebook friend, and from there I decided to take her online 30 Day Vegan Challenge. That was my first exposure to her recipes, and it wasn't long before I decided to get her Joy of Vegan Baking cook book. Thank you Colleen, for not only figuring out how to make vegan versions of all my old favorites, but also sharing your own favorites. I am excited about baking again, and my house is once again filled with delicious smells and flavors. And the icing on the cake has been getting to know Colleen through her writing and podcasts and to have gained a new appreciation for how important a plant based diet is for the animals, the environment and ultimately us. She's a gem and this book is a must have for anyone looking for healthy baking options.

1423113462|5.0|I have learned that Rick Riordan is an excellent writer, so when I found out he continued the Half-bloods story I had to get the books. This book is well written, and if you enjoyed the Percy Jackson books you will enjoy these as well.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was very good. Almost as good as the book.<br />A good young adult/ teen movie.<br />not recommended for young children
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Great movie - found out information I did not know - very educational.  A must watch for all - especially students of American history.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have no tips and guidelines...just enjoy the book...Kathy Reichs is a great author!  She has other great reads, as well.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|We all make up our own definitions to fit our own needs. Clarity breaks down the false rationalization while giving us a way to grow and move forward, maybe even to bloom. This story combines a correction of perspective with a real life struggle that goes untold about too often. Nicely done.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|UFO's Strangers in the Night is an incredibly under-rated live rock album. It does not get the recognition of some of the more common live albums (Frampton Live, Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder, etc.  But it should!!! Michael Shenker really shines on this album....he's an incredible guitar player and the folks in Chicago (where the concert was played) saw one hell of a show.  The Song \\"Rock Bottom\\" is an absolute masterpiece of live guitar playing...Shenker is really showing off on that one.  All in all, this is a fabulous live album....track after track will have you playing this one at full volume!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot.  The actors interact very well togather and the story line is easy to follow.  The Language was a little strong but i realize that Movie makers feel that people real people talk like that because they do.  All in all I really liked it
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|really??? how low can a company be to fake review itself without even spacing them out. not to mention the spyware attached why is amazon allowing such apps.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book back in junior high school but it was one of the few books that stayed with me through out the years.  Now 20 some years later I'm reading this again with great pleasure now that a movie is being made.  What really captured me especially reading this again is how deeply this book places you inside Ender's head.  The character is so well written you almost forget you're reading about a child and how he deals with the different challenges deliberately placed upon him.  The action is smartly written, the characters developed nicely, and conclusion is one that almost pulls at you emotionally.  Overall a great read for young adults and old.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|we playing it a couple times a month. It's still fun. I hope to play it for many more months
B00873GRU4|4.0|This is the first Hugh Howey book that I have read and I have to say I liked it. Clearly a lot of work has gone into it. Kept me interested from start to finish. Particularly like the unpredictability of the characters and their fates. My only comment would be that it felt rushed in places. Not quite enough explanation or substance behind why certain events take place and as a reader you are asking yourself whether within the context of the place you have been taken to, would those events be likely to occur so conveniently (perhaps the writer was already preparing the story for film adaptation).
B007JMW46U|5.0|I liked this 150 page short story of Sherlock Holmes. This is a book that can be enjoyed by adults ANC also younger readers. I'm sue both my grand children would have liked it, (from11-12 yrs. & up).
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Most sequels fail to live up to the original movie.  Iron Man 2 does not disappoint!  Great action and RDJ is awesome.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Too complicated for me. Don't like to play games that end up on Facebook etc. I'm bored and could care less about other people's scores and games. I like to play them for myself.
B005I547ZG|3.0|Wasn't up to Michael Connelly's usual standard. Feel he just couldn't be bothered to<br />make a decent story. Read most of his books will give him a rest for a while.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Not even just for a free app... I am just genuinely impressed altogether with this app! I have comp programs and paid apps that Don't work this well. I wish there was a computer program I could use.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was a fun and entertaining movie. It was a change from the usual character played by Rogen. I highly recommend it for a nice movie night.
0446672653|1.0|The author is dealing in fantasies of a past life in the people he proposes to help.A waste of time. Stupid story line.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|My second introduction to Dan Brown wasn't as impressive as the first (Deception Point), but it was still OK as light entertainment. He has a formula that works, but I guess his style annoyed me a bit this time (If just for once a character could just climb into a lift instead of, say, 'entering an Otis XB17 Elevator with a capacity of 2000 kg, manufactured by the Otis company in Prioria Illinois, which was started in 1907 after a need was identified for an elevator which could...' you get the point...<br /><br />Again, it's not literature, but it doesn't pretend to be
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Once I seen the reviews for Beautiful Disaster I knew I had to read it; it seemed like one of those books that if you hate it, you absolutely HATE it and if you love it you swoon over it. I just KNEW I had to read it... and had a suspicion once I seen the comments on Travis Maddox that I would be on the opposite side of the views: that I would love him. And I did.    Let's start with Abby Abernathy. I disliked her. A lot and especially for the first 3/4 of the book. Towards the end of the book I started to like her a bit more but I just wanted to slap her most of the time. She could not get her head straight. She led Travis on, made stupid decisions and for someone who was supposed to be so smart, acted quite stupid for a large part of the book. I loved Travis. I know there is so many strong feelings about how he treated Abby and woman but I honestly liked him. I do think he was slightly possessive, but not in a scary way... more codependent if anything and Abby absolutely was as well. I also love bad boys, especially ones with tattoos. They will always be my weakness  I adored America and Shepley through and through.. the two of them had 20x more sense than Travis and Abby combined plus they both adored their best friends.    I loved Travis's family. They were so sweet but with tough exteriors and had a great family dynamic, but not without their past struggles. I found it realistic as well and that was refreshing. Abby's situation.. not so much. It wasn't the fact of her actual family life, that was fairly realistic, it was the fact that she grew up around mobsters, had the balls to go to Vegas to face off with them and actually could get away with strolling through casinos in Las Vegas like she owned the place. Now, I have never been to Vegas nor have I ever been around mobsters but I'm just assuming... it's not entirely that easy to stroll into a casino as a minor and get away with half the s*** she did. That part was strange to me... and felt a bit random to me.    Towards the end of the book I really tired of the back and forth Abby and Travis had though. I felt it dragged on a bit too long and that is what made me not love the story entirely. I knew they were going to end up together, it was just a fact of how so I was just waiting for it to happen. I enjoyed the ending a lot and felt it completely summed up their relationship: irrational, spontaneous and just a bit weird.    Despite the character flaws, and me not liking Abby I loved their relationship. It was just as addictive to read as it was for them to experience it. As I try to write this review, it's so strange because I have so many problems with the book but I really loved it. It was so addictive, I could not put it down... literally; I read it in one sitting. I know I've listed so many problems with Beautiful Disaster but I enjoyed it all the same. It's just a strange review to write... you really do need to read it to experience it.    It's definitely one of my favorite New Adult novels and I immediately went and picked up Walking Disaster... I absolutely need to read this from Travis's POV!
B0096PAA6E|4.0|i really liked it. I bought two copies cause i let my little brother listen to it and he also liked it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is, in a word, AWESOME! It is really fun to play,  challenging, and addictive. The objective is to make a glowing thing grow by absorbing smaller glowing things, and without being absorbed first by even bigger glowing things and antimatter. Play it - it's fun. :-)
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and I really like it.  I think it is a fun, brainless movie.  Maybe that is why I like it.  But Daniel Craig rarely smiles in his movies.  He is always a serious person.  I think that is why I like him.

0307476464|4.0|This is the second novel that I have read by Murakami. The first one being A Wild Sheep Chase. I found this novel satisfying at several points throughout, but I was so aggravated by the repetitiveness. I also kept thinking as I was reading how many times can you get to this point and have nothing happen, or how many times do you have to mention this and have it not be fully explained. I give it four stars because I thought it was a good novel, and to end up in another world that parallel's your own world. It was just that the fact that it was repetitive and the fact that we never got to learn the truth from certain characters, and never saw characters we were acquainted with throughout the whole story at the end.<br /><br />Like someone said before the beginning was slow, but still interesting. The second half of the book picked up, but began to wane ad carry on way too long. It could've been wrapped in less pages than more than 11 hundred.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|I've never been a 007 fan, but I love Daniel Craig's acting.  He makes 007 believable. Daniel Craig is an awesome actor.

B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I have not (yet) read Tolstoy's novel and maybe that is why I could love this movie so much compared to so many who simply hated it.  I *never* purchase movies but purchased this one from Amazon.  I've now watched the film 3 times and am on the 4th as I write.  Each successive time I catch new bits of mastery and genius by director Joe Wright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard.    The movie has so many layers it is hard to adequately describe.  I can only say watch, and watch again.  After the third or fourth time you will start to see how the pieces of this movie fit together like the pieces of any exceptional puzzle -- the blend of flavors by a great chef, the interplay of notes and themes of a great composition, the design of a beautiful garden.    What is it that grabs you and just doesn't let go?:    *DANCE & CHOREOGRAPHY are THE star of this show. You don't quite know if this is realism, camp, vogue, ballet, broadway, or what.  For me it worked beautifully and I typically don't like musicals.  There is no singing, but the combination of realistic dialog and story with the fantastical dance and choreographed movement of the actors worked stunningly.  My favorite scene of the movie -- the waltz scene -- is just mesmerizing...all of the dancers became frozen in time until Anna and Vronsky waltz past and pull them whirling into their vortex.  In particular Aaron Taylor-Johnson's dancing left me slackjawed.  All I can say is watch for yourself and see if you've ever seen a man dance like that.    *SCREENPLAY.  Brilliant.  Each time I watch I see how the screenplay brings certainly not all of Tolstoy's plot, but surely a great deal of the meaning and larger themes he brought to the novel (I've since read several novel summaries).  The screenplay is layered -- each time you watch again you see and understand more.  These little bits step out front when you have watched several times and are no longer so distracted by the gorgeous and fantastical spectacle that is going on.    *SETTING.  As others have noted; all the world's a stage in this movie.  For the first 10 minutes you don't know if you are watching the characters watch a play, but then you realize they *are* the play.  I remember feeling very off guard my first time watching...is Stiva going to be murdered by the barber?  Is the giant pear a bomb?  Why is the barber like a toreador?  Why is a couple dancing on the theater floor and another woman wandering playing a concertina?  What the HECK is going on??? After about 5 or 10 minutes you get it, settle in and it no longer seems strange... you truly feel that life *IS* art.  You never stop marveling at the beauty and ingenuity of it this bold directorial choice.  The juxtaposition of reality and theater setting, the model trains segueing to real trains and back -- these things seem like they could not possibly work in theory.  But they work.  The choreography and dialogue of the actors at cousin Betsy's society party and her firework surprise were visually stunning and just magical.    * COSTUMES.  Lavish, gorgeous, over the top.  Wright uses color like no other.  Vronsky is all blond youthful curls, bright blue-eyed, and wore white and light blue, while Anna has deep dark burden of an older woman who has never loved -- she is dark haired, eyed and skinned, and wears only black or dark colors.  Wright made the unusual choice of using a lot of redhead and very fair-skinned men throughout and film, which was quite beautiful with the film's coloring, and yet cast olive skinned women as their love interests.  Very rich, visually interesting film.    * ACTING:  Jude Law as Karenin, Matthew McFayden as Anna's brother Stiva, Domnhall Gleeson as country landowner Levin all had scene-stealing performances.  Olivia Williams shined as Vronsky's mother.  Ruth Wilson's delightful turn as Vronsky's bad-tinkerbell cousin Princess Betsy made a new fan of me.  Keira Knightly -- I'd give a maybe little pat on the back but nothing special.  Shelooked exquisite and handled her part quite well and maybe that was enough. While everyone says Aaron Taylor-Johnson was miscast as Vronsky, I suppose that is only if you expect the character to be true to the novel.  I thought Aaron brought a rakish vulnerability to the character that I've never quite seen on screen -- now that I think of it perhaps only Richard Gere in his youth -- rather like a desperate child on the one hand; on the other an arrogant cad, stopping at nothing to embroil a married woman in his torrid lust (or is it love?) affair.  I think he will turn out to be one of this generations most gifted actors.  You know the saying \\"so handsome it hurts\\".  Well he's that too.  Just as exquisite as Keira...so in that sense they are well matched, though I thought his depth as an actor was far greater.  Their almost impossible beauty adds to the pain of the relationship.    Any more and this review would be too long.  See it for yourself, stick it out, and if nothing else, see something like you've never seen before.

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I've been a huge fan of this band since their first album release. I have loved every single song they put out, so of course, I was excited about their new album. I pre-ordered it and got day of shipping. It arrived just on time, perfect condition. I put it in and listened and was SO AMAZED by the variety of sound on this CD. Paramore was clearly exploring, because no song on this album (with the exception of the interludes) sound the same. From &#34;Fast in my Car&#34; all the way to &#34;Future&#34;, this album gives you a great new Paramore. I can't wait to see what they do next. They never fail to disappoint!
0385738781|4.0|I've read all three of the &#34;trilogy&#34; (now reading the prequel) and I really enjoyed them all.<br /><br />As with most books in a trilogy, the third (The Death Cure) was not my favorite, but it was still really good.<br /><br />The characters are developed well and the story comes to a satisfying conclusion. A must read if you've read the first two books, (The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials) or if you like sci-fi, dystopian worlds, etc...
B003UYUP58|5.0|The Emperor of all Maladies is an astoundingly beautifully written book about a chilling subject.  Mukherjee traces a history of cancer and cancer treatment 'throughout the ages,' although he spends the bulk of the book on the past 100 years, and maybe even a third of it on the last 50.  He gives even time to cancer treatment, prevention, and advocacy, and also describes a few of the cases he himself treated.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about this book is the depth of Mukherjee's research abilities in both the sciences and the humanities.  He recounts the experiments and theories that led to new cancer studies as only a scientist could do, allowing the reader to understand how new developments in cancer medicine are discovered and tested.  The explanations are as sophisticated as it is possible for a lay person to understand.  Mukherjee is also, however, aware of how important the descriptions and images of a disease are; he gives a cultural historian's account of cancer as an idea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all readers.  It is beautiful and interesting.  Although it is not overwrought or saccharine, I cried more than once reading it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Well first of all  there is no monsters and you get like 1 minecraft day to play  and I only had one dirt house
B00288KNJU|5.0|Received very quickly & was in excellent condition. We were very happy with our purchase and would not hesitate to order from th again. My daughter loves this movie & after losing her other one she was so excited when she open the package. Thanks again
0061998885|3.0|I read Shutter Island and thought it was a great book.  I saw the movies Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone and thought, &#34;This author is among the best&#34;.  Then I read Moonlight Mile based on that reputation and was shocked how terrible the book was.  I thought this can't happen twice so I reached back to an earlier book, Prayers for Rain.  Unfortunately, I was met with the same disappointment.  The book's characters are boring and I don't care about any of them.  When I imagine them, they are just cartoon characters - no real depth.  The main character's best friend goes around killing people but never has to answer for it and our hero - the main character, who is allegedly solving cases to right the wrongs done - don't seem bothered by this at all.  The most unfortunate part of this is I still have two more novels by Lehane that I bought at the same time.  I'm sure I will read them in hopes they are better but I won't hold my breath.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|but this alarm clock is wI have tried four other alarm clocks this one is way above the rest.  it is easy to. Use and looks great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for kids and adults alike. Graphics are cool and characters are funny and anyone can learn how to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.I love playing this game just to have fun and beat my friends high scores.you get to jump on trains.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The movie was really not very interesting. It was slow-moving and dim-witted. We turned it off and did not finish watching it.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This last book in the wheel of time series was rushed and all around not as good as the books written by Robert Jordan.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Doesn't work on ICS. Crashes every time you try to search. Absolute waste.  Looks like it might be nice if it worked properly.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I really like this game, when I can actually play it. It's getting really really frustrating because I paid for the upgrade, but can't even play the game. Every time I try it shuts down on me.....please please please fix!!!!
B005F2BBLK|5.0|with our 3 year old grand-daughter. Parents, grandparents and children all love it.<br />I don't get tired of it. Rango is awesome. He is flawed and humble and doesn't feel like a hero even though it's always been his dream. Being a hero takes hard work it's not all glory. He should be every kids role model.<br /><br />You are a human being with weaknesses but stand up for yourself and what you believe in.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Streisand and Rogen did a convincing job of being mother and son, and playing the love/hate relationship. I thought this movie was pretty entertaining. Watched this on my Wii at home with the Amazon Prime Channel.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I used to like the app - alot.  However the most recent update (version 4.0.1.3) broke the dictionary function and now the Kindle app is like the other 3 eReader apps I have on my Android tablet - no reason for me to use Kindle or buy eBooks from Amazon.  Your support people, while being well-meaning, were of no help.  So unless you have better software controls and testing, consider me an ex-Kindle fan
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I can tell this movie is going to be a classic. Such a moving story. The character development was very impressive.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Though I appreciated the message that Cheryl gave about us encouraging young girls and women to lead and aspire to the highest offices, and while I have my own personal commitment to remove barriers to success for women AND people of color, I think this message is &#34;nothing new&#34;. It was interesting to read about her carrier and what tools/resources that she felt contributed to her success, unfortunately it is not a magic &#34;just add water&#34; potion for success for all women.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I chose this book after a friend recommended it. I was more interested in the organizational level habit development, but after reading this book I see that the pattern is pretty much the same whether you're talking about personal, family or workplace habits. The best description I can give anyone considering this book is 'a lot of stuff you don't know that you know'. I gave it five stars not only for the great content, but the overall layout of the book. Very well put together, great flow to it.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zep classic rock music .... the fabric of my life<br />I need 9 more words to submit ... so buy this album
0451457994|4.0|A classic book is like a little black dress--it never goes out of style.  This book is that little black dress, modern and edgy even after all these years.  Except for a few dated references, this book is still weirdly futuristic almost 40 years after it was played and written. True sci-fi fans might find it a bit tame by today's comparisons, but it was perfect for a newbie like me.<br /><br />The book opens on man's far genealogical past, with a galactic monolith and an ape who instantly gets much smarter.  Flash forward millions of year.  Another monolith has been found on the moon and some type of alarm deep within it has been triggered.  Spacecraft Discover is dispatched to the moon to see what's up.  HAL9000, uber-computer, is in total control so this mission should be no problem.  HAL has been modeled after humans, so there is a problem.  A big problem.  Unfortunately, HAL is a neurotic, paranoid mess before the ship can even make it to the moon.  David, a scientist sent to figure out the mystery on the moon, first has to figure out the mystery of HAL, if he wants to survive.<br /><br />I am not a huge science fiction fan but I do love a good alien conspiracy story. The book is based on a screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, which is the complete opposite of what I usually do--book first, then the movie.  Apparently, it was only a short story by Clarke until Kubrick got hold of it.  I'm glad he did.  I have seen the movie so long ago I'm not even sure how it's relevant to the story so feel free to do one, or the other, or both.  This is the first in a series but stands completely alone as a complete story, which is nice.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zep II ... This is what rock and roll is made out of ... This album is the fabric of my youth ... It was huge music made by a small band of talented musicians ... It is timeless ... buy it ... buy it now!!!
6304493681|5.0|This is a classic movie and a must for an anime library.  It is timeless and the DVD I received portrayed it fully.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|a fish is a fish, ico and shadow of the colossus are the way I remember them, beautiful stories to play through and experience.
1594202842|2.0|What struck me most about this book was its repeated theme of familial conflict. I am a parent and have quite high expectations of my children. I didn't necessarily disagree with most of the author's aspirations for her children. What I found disconcerting was her method of reaching such goals. I think she could have approached child-rearing in a more compassionate way while still maintaining high expectations. I cannot imagine the perpetual stress those girls experienced throughout their childhoods.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I don't even remember the movie I was watching when I heard the song at the theaters.  When I purchased this album I knew there would be a language barrier, but after the first thirty seconds or so I just let the album ride.  It's an amazing product and the production is spot on.  I can't wait for the opportunity to see this artist in person or to hear some new music.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing this game. It keeps your mind working on trying to find the matches. Keeps you guessing all the time
B008B1VYP0|4.0|This album is good pop music, but I miss the Maroon 5 of old; the Maroon 5 that produced songs like &#34;Hands All Over&#34; (on repeat on my iPod), &#34;Give a Little More&#34; and &#34;Sweetest Goodbye.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Overexposed&#34; is a good album; there wasn't a song that I could say I didn't enjoy--as a matter of fact, I purchased the album for &#34;One More Night&#34;--but I wish they didn't have to fall victim to the fickle listener and traipse into trendy pop music. I'm sure they would beg to disagree--after all, this album fared better than their previous effort and I'm pretty sure all of the singles have made it into the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, which is more than can be said for their prior records.<br /><br />I'm hoping thanks to their resurgence, they'll return to their roots (&#34;Songs About Jane&#34; is one of my all-time favorite albums), but I refuse to not give credit where it is due; therefore, I have to say this is a good album and I'd recommend it.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I used to play this game when I was younger. I always love playing Pacman, For anyone who used to play this I would get this game

B00127RAJY|4.0|I love that I feel like a get a good work out in about 20 minutes. I only wish Jillian Michaels wasn't in the video as I find her annoying. I am familiar enough with the routine now that I can mute the tv and follow along. This makes the workout much more pleasant.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Nice to find a story of our time that does not succom to cultural indignity. Relatable story with real characters.
B0058O84G0|4.0|I liked the book as a lesson in Europ´s history in the 20th century. Hope to read sequell. I do rate the book as a 3,5 stars.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|Plain Jane version of temple run. Good challenges and fun to advance. Overall ok for a sit in the airport pastime.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I gave this book one star because the size of the charts are smaller than a playing card.  Totally useless under any circumstance.  Not sure so wrote the other reviews but there is no way this guide was used be anyone with any field experience.  I own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 which should replicate the size of the original charts.  I do own the spiral bound copy.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|All the greatest hits in one download!!!What I want when I want it.Threat way to start the day.Way to Go Flea!!

B0089LOKHG|4.0|I loved this finale! The only reason for me giving it 4 stars is because it does cuss.... not as much as Pandemonium, but it does have some words!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series; I only wish it came on throughout the year rather than having to wait months and months. It is an excellent series.
B009C7JS14|4.0|It is a great app. I do not want to give it a bad reveiw. But it only gives u 2 locations. Get weather live.
B004UHPU5E|5.0|Dear fellow Crimson Fans: When has Robert Fripp and company EVER done what you expected? When has he ever catered to the whim that \\"Crimson is supposed to sound like such and such\\"? If you will listen carefully throughout, you will here the sonic colors that are the hallmarks of Robert Fripp's musical vocabulary over the past two decades (especially on 'The Other Man'). What you will hear that is different is a different amount of restraint and control. Stan Kenton once said his group had gotten so progressive that they fell of the edge and had to start over again. I don't think that happened here, however, having Mel Collins does harken back to Crimson's early days where their albums had sax and flute included in the ensemble regularly. For those of you who persistently always refer to a Soprano Sax as \\"that Kenny G sounding instrument,\\" may I humbly suggest you listen to John Coltrane's \\"My Favorite Things\\" albums so you no longer embarrass yourself by revealing the only place you have ever heard soprano sax is on your Kenny G albums. My only disagreement is with Fripp's assertion that this is not Crimson, but a Crimson ProjeKCt. There is no reason why this isn't King Crimson. Listen Deeper Friends.
030788743X|5.0|The Book is Awesome! Ernest Cline is a Genius! and talking about the edition it's quite beautiful and the pages are made in a good quality.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Very well done.  I was prompted to purchase weekly episodes. This has become my favorite tv show.  I hope ABC recognizes the show's quality.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The presentation and the music were great!  I have watched selection several times and plan to show it to my grandchildren.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I watched both the Colin Firth and Keira Knightly versions.  This one is a truncated version of the miniseries.  They cut down some of the sub plots that were featured in the miniseries. However the main story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is essentially the same. Beautifully acted and the chemistry between Mattew Macfadyn and Keira Knightly is palatable. Matthew Macfadyn pretty much lived up to the shadow cast by Colin Firth.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable movie. I was sorry to see it end!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read all the Harry Bosch novels and all the books by Connelly.  This was very well done and worth the price.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This series really takes you back to some calmer times with a great deal of emphasis on the family.  The settings are very detailed and the countryside is gorgeous.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|From the very first moments into the film my husband and I kept thinking &#34;We hope the lighting of the scenes improves.&#34;  At first the darkness of every scene appeared to be for a &#34;scary&#34; effect.  But the unlit rooms went on and on and on and on--to a point wherein we got the impression that the film was deliberately shot without good lighting so that the producers could save some money on backgrounds.  After 20 minutes we stopped the film, very disappointed, and feeling cheated.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book ever! I absolutely loved it!<br />It was so exciting and it made me tear up a bit at certain times!<br />:)
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|excellent game<br />love the daily challenges and the multiplayer.  i only wish there were more to do in the single player.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It took about half the book before things started making sense. And the last quarter moves very quickly. The words paint a beautiful picture of the circus. I'm glad I read it on my kindle in the stark black and white. Now I'm dying to knit a delicate red scarf!
