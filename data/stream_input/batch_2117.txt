B005MMY5RK|1.0|I hated that the movie stopped all the time and then wouldnt resume and I had to watch this movie for school!
0613173503|2.0|I thought I ordered a book and it came to me in a mini book. I am going to keep it. but I wish you would put somewhere that it is not the actual size book.
B001OKGV6W|4.0|This movie was okay.  Was not exactly what I expected, but was not bad at all.  Would probably watch it again.
B004PGO25O|5.0|A quick and concise manual for smashing that enemy of a dynamic life squarely in the kisser.  Read it now!
0316236535|5.0|I tutor young children in how to read and have found that finding books that interest them and are fun to memorize as well as interactive are a great way to get them to start being interested.<br /><br />i wore out the first copy and so I had to order this one and I am hoping that the new students will love it as much as my former ones did.  I enjoy it too.  So clever!
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic. I thought I loved &#34;Glee&#34;'s Chris Colfer to begin with, but this book has brought it to a new level. His witty sarcasm made the already fantastic story all the more enjoyable. Carson Phillips is so relatable on so many levels, and his triumphs and tragedies are the epitome of the high school experience.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|That perfect blend of an easy yet captivating novel.  Really loved learning about the flowers and the meanings associated with them.
B005LAII08|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this movie. I read new software was used to make Merida's hair more life like and it worked. Her hair is what made me fall in love with her right from the beginning. The story itself is not what I expected. Without spoiling the story, this movie is not simply a teenager rebelling against her parents. It may start that way but stick with it and I think both sides can learn something from the story, especially parents (and I am an adult saying this). And of course there is fun mixed in with a serious message. The triplets are hysterical, I just want to hug them as I shake my head at them. They are like a puppy - so cute you can't stay mad at them. I haven't watched the blu-ray version yet but the dvd picture is crisp and clear. This is a top notch movie from head to tail. Something you can enjoy with the entire family, even if you have to tie down the teenagers I think they will enjoy it. Merida has a spunky spirit that I think many teenage daughters can relate to. I think I would if I was a teenager again.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great little story and movie. Grand daughter watches it over and over. Such clean little movie for the 3 year old.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because it is Adam Sandler and animated. It is better than I expected. It is a lot of fun and a really cute story that I think adults and kids can enjoy. It has a love story and chaos rolled into one. But chaos that won't drive you nuts, at least not for me. This is a movie I've already watched over and over, almost daily.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|A great story;A young boy finds out he's the son of the sea god persiden who was forced to leave him when he was just A baby.And soon finds out that he's been accused of stealing ZEUS Lighting Bolt.So with help from friends he searches for the bolt return to ZEUS or there will be war among the Gods.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I have come to love Kate Morton stories!  Love the way this story plays out - flashbacks so detailed you forget they are flashbacks, but then the story picks up and you go on.  Absolutely NOT predictable - it will keep you reading far into the night!  Another time in history, another view of life.  If you like Kate Morton, you will not be disappointed!
B008133MDK|5.0|Reminds me of psync but much more intense!  Love the settings!  Sherlock attitude is right on!  Hope the series continues!
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|Everything was great. The tokens feel good and the cards are all well made. The only problem was that the board was slightly ruined at the end of the crease. This was easily fixed with some clear tape, and you can barely tell it was messed up when I first got it. Other then that, I love it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is all the Matrix movies along with hundreds of hours of extras. I have the set on DVD but needed the Blu Ray version. Very pleased.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for 20 years, and it did not disappoint! i highly recommend this series.
B0036UW09U|4.0|i always loved this movie, no one can compare singing to b. streistand..she is incredible, and i have always been a fan of kri.  love the two together
B0088W4YTK|4.0|I started with Stargate SG-1 and went through the whole series.  This has more inter-personal relationships than SG-1.  Some continually irritating issues with one of the characters being a know it all, who is often wrong, but that is life, so...
B002KGEORM|5.0|i am a big fans of sons of anarchy.  the story lines just keep getting better and better and i am glued to my seat.  love all the characters and the parts they play.  sons of anarchy rule!!
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is a Blu-ray set from the UK.  They are great!  They auto-play function is great!  No adds, trailers or junk at the beginning!  Put the disk in and the movie just plays.  Great price and auto-play, really worth it to me!
B004XGA3KE|5.0|He is the next big Star, His music well be big next year at the grammys.I love his music, I play this CD EVERYDAY.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|This brief, two-season series (5 episodes in season one and 3 episodes in season two) introduces a new aspect of the talent of Judy Dench. If each role she plays is a single facet of the sparkling crystal of her career, this one is on the completely opposite side of her role as James Bond's boss M.  In the Cranford stories, she is kindness personified, and you root for nothing but her happiness. I only wish there were more.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Another great group from the UK, their music is so great, its so exciting to hear in the car, puts you in the best mood for the day.LOVE IT&#62;
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept my interest the entire read and led to a great discussion at our book club. Will look forward to read another of Flynn's novel's.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Super fun and addicting,your kids will love this game. Totally worth the 99&cent;! Fun. If your kid likes Perry the platypus, they will love this.<br /><br />Bottom line: yes, I would recommend this to a friend
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Loved the ending, had no idea! And I love it when I can't figure out the ending. Really good movie!
B000067FP8|4.0|I think the first Gremlins is much better but my 7yr old son has been re-watching this since I bought it for him. It arrived quickly and the price was great!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I couldn't wait to see what The Thing was, and I guess I needed more explanation. I enjoyed it. Will have to watch it again.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love the soundtrack but I will give it one caveat: see the movie first.  The director and actors in the movie take the Les Mis stageplay with near-operatic numbers and tell the story in its raw form with minimalist singing and literally putting all of the pain and struggles of the characters in your face.  Once you see the movie, you can fully appreciate the soundtrack and will want to listen to the numbers over and over again as you recall the intense moments from the movie as I do.  Check out the movie - it was awesome and the soundtrack fits it perfectly!
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I think I may have to watch this one again for a more favorable opinion. I felt a little disappointed when it was over.
B00821OX98|3.0|No Battlestar Galactica (new series) but enjoyable and entertaining family based SCI-FI. Characters are likeable but no stand outs. All that said defienitely worth a watch.
B00005LE0E|5.0|This movie really surprised me at the end, I LOVE it! But the copy I bought can't be read by my DVD player. I need to return it. Someone should check for that before they ship them. The error I got was actually listed as a reason for return, so they KNOW this is a problem! Very disappointing!
B0098460O4|5.0|I chose this raiting because they proved to be such a great dluo at such a young age.  I hope they make more music together.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|The characters were believable and gripping from beginning to end.  A veritable page turner. Nicholas Sparks doesn't disappoint.  I can usually figure out endings but this one was suspenseful and had me guessing.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Still reading it but its very good book ... and having my kindle is a great way to read books on the go

B00942G4UA|5.0|Interesting documentary.  Although you may not want to it is good to know where the food you are eating comes from.  It definitely makes me think people can make a difference with the food choices they make.  One surprising thing for me was the respect I gained for Wal Mart, normally I am not a Wal Mart fan, but they did listen to their consumers and opted to stock more organic products.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it most fabulous game.......................love horses amazing addictive prices for upgrades are too high though.....the parents that play this game are never gonna earn enough cause were too busy being parents
B00005K3NY|4.0|Im still amazed that everything was &#34;discovered&#34; in the 60s-70s.... Movies like this one are no longer issued anymore, today movies are not so good enough
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Cool game but need a reward. To be able to jump higher. Sometimes. You get stuck in between. The trains and there's. No where else to jump a lot of the time. A lil direction. At the beginning. Of the game about how to play and what you can win. If there. Are any moves or jumps you can win. A train that you can suddenly fall inside sour be great!
B0091V6TF4|2.0|Practically Id expected more in disc 2. There are some melodies missed and it only seems they appeared in a &#34;long-play&#34; dated on 1982 aproximately
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I play it all day I am addicted. To this game I'm not a game freak. I will give you a 100 percent for this game the best game in the world
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great series ! So glad to have &#34;Prime&#34; so I can see many British series.I prefer this system.Fun to watch
B007ZXK08C|3.0|When i started reading this book, i wondered where it was going. Boy meets girl, both writers, ordinary middle class life, and i thought, I read it all before. I was told to keep reading by others who has read it before me and the point would come to light. After the first few chapters it did! I was hooked into it immediatly. Seems he's not such a nice guy at all, particullary according to his wife, who is called &#34;amazing Amy&#34;. She is high maintanence and her revenge is going to be the most amazing thing ever! Sure enough it is. He finds himself in a nasty situation, so that he has to beg forgivness from Amy, so she can rescue him. Good interesting, detailed, stories of things that had happened in the past in their lives that blend in well with the story. Gripping reading till almost the end. I was waiting for some sort of justice to be done to the real villan in the story, only to have it fall flat.
B008EG700U|5.0|Jens Lekman is, to those in the know, unquestionably the catchiest and strongest songwriter in the indie-pop galaxy ... or at least that's my opinion on an undecidably subjective question.  He is often compared, stylistically and (to an extent) lyrically to that of other pop-inflected acts like Belle & Sebastian or The Magnetic Fields's Stephen Merritt, and as an inveterate sampler, he's not especially concerned with obscuring his influences.  But to my ears, at least, his tunes are stronger and easier to listen to over and over again than those of the aforementioned acts, or of other competitors in the same retro-indie, hook-driven market like, say, Vampire Weekend.  The key is often the lyrics, which manage to be so flippantly specific and universally authentic at the same time that you have to believe the Swedish Lekman made a shady supernatural deal at some point in exchange for his lexical brilliance.  I know a lot of native-born anglophones (myself included) who would sacrifice a limb to acquire such facility.<br /><br />Lekman's most recent effort, now five years old, was the exquisitely baroque, grandiosely-arranged Night Falls over Kortedala.  The songs on that album were drenched in classical strings, brass sections, and ripe, at times danceable samples.  So exuberant was the previous work that the first thing you notice about I Know What Love Isn't is how pared down it is: whereas Night Falls over Kortedala begins with a full orchestra and Jens singing in a suave baritone, only to leap a Broadwayish octave for the chorus, the new work starts instrumentally, with Jens picking out arpeggios on an upright piano in \\"Every Little Hair Knows Your Name.\\"  Where the last album was Technicolor, this one is sepia.  This is not to say that its (still incredibly catchy) tunes aren't sprinkled with more instrumental color (from saxophones, flutes, recorders, etc.) than the somber grisaille of some acoustic indie.  But it is certainly a more somber soundscape, which reinforces and is perhaps dictated by its post-break-up subject matter.<br /><br />The songwriting and the excellent lyrical craftsmanship are still in evidence, still transmuting mundane conversation topics into poetry.  For instance, in the title song, we get the following dialogue: \\"Hey do you wanna go see a band? / No I hate bands / It's always packed with men spooning their girlfriends / Clutching their hands / As if they'd let go / They would lift from the ground and ascend.\\"  It's simple, eloquent, and approaches the post-breakup world obliquely, not whining but simply showing the subtle, pervasive effects of heartbreak.  \\"Become Someone Else's\\" contains a lot of subtle Lekman wordplay, and he can also be quite blunt: but whereas on Night Falls over Kortedala he was the one being blunt (\\"I am leaving you / Because I don't love you\\"), here he is the recipient of a similarly difficult truth: \\"... there is no lover / She just don't want to / Be with you / Anymore.\\"  In the end, \\"Every Little Hair Knows Your Name\\" returns, but this version is for voice and guitar alone.  It is a simple and beautiful song, based around a poetic subject that could easily be clever, but is wistful and mature here.<br /><br />If you like the rest of Jens Lekman's work, you definitely need to have this.  However, give it time to work on you.  I heard him play through the entire CD live before buying it, and while I was able to appreciate a lot of the work intellectually, it's only after playing the CD a few times that I've come to really love the songs.  What you get here is simply the excellent structure that underpins his previous work, without the blatantly gorgeous trappings.  You will miss them in the same way that Jens seems to miss his lover, which is exactly where this album wants you to be: in the same clear-eyed and bittersweet fugue of nostalgia that pervades each song.

1449410243|5.0|I must confess I didn't have a cat when I bought this item. Much like I'd never seen a zombie when I bought the zombie survival handbook. Well lets just say that now I cannot go anywhere without the constant fear of kitties!!! If you look they are everywhere, with their cute cuddly little beady eyes of death. I heard that one time a guy in Kansas City forgot to pet his cat and BAM 6 years later he was struck by a car! And one time my friend forgot to feed his cats, and his roommate goes missing for 5 days. They found him in a Tijuana prison, With a cat tattoo! This book has me scared my friends. I know how to fight off zombies, but how do you fight off an internet full of kittens? Simply put you cant. My suggestion is to read this book, love it, live it, And some day when the evil cats overthrow our government and rule us all maybe you will be privileged enough to be one of their staff, and avoid the fiery dog pits of doom!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is fun however it constantly freezes up on you. Takes your bingo chips which pi**es me off because you have paid good money for them and when you let their customer service department know you do not get your money back. Not even a quarter and they do not give you any bingo chips either.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|NY Times says:<br />Behold the lord and master, forever springing up from behind his newspaper, spurred to action by news of some fresh calamity befallen his trusty valet. Or his cook. Or the girl who dusts the grates. Or the farmer down the road. For a man of equanimity, Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham and lord of Downton Abbey, is surprisingly prone to fits of temper — nothing sparks his ire like an injustice done to a social inferior in his employ. You half-expect him to tear off his dinner jacket and reveal a spandex unitard as he rushes to succor an admiring serf. When a young woman accuses his footman of cowardice, the master leaps to the man’s defense, chin quivering in righteous indignation. When his shellshocked interim valet tells him people look at him and wonder why he’s not in uniform, the master bellows, “You refer them to me and I’ll give them a piece of my mind!” Earlier, when Bates, his original, beloved valet, resigned without an explanation, the master reacted like a spurned lover, hurling threats and vitriol, only to collapse in a puddle of remorse and apologize for the “low shot. ” He blames himself. He always blames himself.<br /><br />Related<br />Behind the Scenes With the Creator of ‘Downton Abbey’ (September 11, 2011) Readers’ Comments<br />Readers shared their thoughts on this article.<br />Read All Comments (70) »<br />With the valet gone, he’s like King Pellinore without the Questing Beast. He mopes around, purposeless. “Any news of Bates?” he asks. “Any news of Bates?” (Each time the question passes his lips, I imagine that thousands of TV viewers toss back tequila shots in unison.) When Carson the butler informs him that the valet has sacrificed himself to protect the family from a terrible scandal, but won’t say what it is so as not to trouble his lordship, his lordship barely registers the patronizing impertinence. There’s something puzzling about the interpersonal dynamic between the earl and his butler. The mutual affection overpowers it. It’s hard to get a handle on who’s fondly condescending to whom. Their exchanges seem likely to end with noogies.<br /><br />Later, when Bates is discovered working in a nearby pub, the earl dons a village-appropriate costume and goes to him. Across the darkened tavern, the square-jawed nobleman will lock eyes with the dewy-eyed manservant, and for a breathless moment it will seem as though he’s going to scoop him up into his capable arms and ferry him back to the castle, where they will live happily ever after. That last part doesn’t happen, but still.<br /><br />Has a fictional aristocrat as upright and honorable, as tender of heart and noble of spirit, as humble, forbearing, magnanimous, solicitous and totally ludicrous as the Earl of Grantham ever graced the screen? Supermodels playing rocket scientists in Nicolas Cage movies put less strain on my credulity. It’s not just that the earl takes his role as steward of the British class system seriously; it’s that he’s positively messianic in his flock-tending. His noblesse is all about oblige. In fact, save for an uncharacteristic, but not at all inconsistent, indiscretion toward the end of the second season, the earl’s behavior is a model of self-effacing forbearance. He simply cannot do enough. You can’t help wondering what gives.<br /><br />None of this is to say it has detracted from my enjoyment. I love “Downton Abbey” all the more for its confusing world view. But there’s something about his lordship’s interactions with his staff that makes them seem to be encoded with secret messages I can’t quite decipher. At first, and for quite a while, I labored under the impression that his character was written with an ear to contemporary liberal sensibilities — as if, in order to aid us in the proper enjoyment of our identificatory fantasy, the guilt of indulging in such a fantasy or even entertaining its point of view would have to be assuaged somehow. (One friend remarked, “Isn’t it how you would like to imagine you would be if you were in his place?”) Ergo the feudal overlord as a corporate manager, a devotee of Tom Peters, subscriber to the method of management by walking around and listening. I came across a description of this managerial style in a management publication. It was described as requiring “personal involvement, good listening skills and the recognition that most people in an organization want to contribute to its success.” Some abbey-worthy suggestions included “wandering about as often as you can, but recurrently and preferably daily”; “being responsive to problems and concerns”; “swapping value and legacy stories”; and, naturally, a prod to “share your dreams.”<br /><br />This fantasy of enlightened management is comforting, especially in its portrayal of a system in which knowing your place was pretty much all it took to remain in your place. What does it take, after all, to get yourself sacked from Downton Abbey? Staff members have lied, stolen, slipped bars of soap under the delicate foot of the lady of the house and conspired to dump slop over the head of a famous general. So far, except for the thief and the pregnant maid, all have remained in the earl’s employ. And even then, the thief is brought back to run the house after returning from the battlefield (earl to butler: “Is it honorable for us to hold Thomas’s sins against him when he has been wounded in the service of the King?”), and it’s not long before the maid is extended a helping hand.<br /><br />I’m not the first to observe that for a show set in a world in which people are grouped by their inherited privilege or ineluctable servitude, the popularity of “Downton Abbey” seems paradoxical in these times of Occupy protests and presidential candidates who aren’t concerned about the very poor and who pay less in taxes proportionally than does Warren Buffett’s secretary. Clearly, something about this show appeals to our deepest desires, granting us the cake-having and cake-eating satisfaction of indulging in a fantasy of a bygone era that we’re actually thankful is gone.<br /><br />Granted, it’s rare that we don’t go nuts for lavishly produced Edwardian costume dramas with beautiful clothes, houses and manners; with their delicious tensions and upheavals and their tendency to squash lowly clerks under enormous bookcases after they enter into ill-advised romances with impulsive, intellectual upper-class girls. (See the tragic denouement of “Howards End.”) But that’s just it — the pleasure we take in these period dramatizations are located precisely in their delicious epochal tensions and cataclysms. If we’ve learned anything from the collective oeuvre of Merchant-Ivory, it’s that seismic shifts in social systems can be tricky to navigate and harder to digest. Caught up in the flux, you can get slightly ahead of yourself (as in “Howards End” and that squashed clerk) or be left behind to ponder the larger implications of a lifetime of blind obeisance to the wrong person (as in “The Remains of the Day”). When I first encountered “Downton Abbey,” I had just come off “The King’s Speech” and was casting around for more stories about the humanizing effects of middle-class forthrightness on well-dressed but out-of-touch aristocrats. Yet the familial relationship between the Earl of Grantham and his servants doesn’t really open up his world at all. It doesn’t make him see things in a new way or make him a better person. He was never not a better person to begin with.<br /><br />Edward Gorey, that beloved and prolific purveyor of doomed Edwardians, once told an interviewer that his mission in life was to make everybody as uneasy as possible, because, he said, “that’s what the world is like.” What “Downton Abbey” offers, by contrast, is a utopian version of the past that’s custom made for the present sociopolitical morass. It presents a system so perfect that it can weather any upheaval, smooth out any wrinkle, absorb any shock. It refers incessantly to the coming collapse of the social order and then sets up its conflicts like bowling pins to be swiftly knocked down and neatly swept away.<br /><br />Two seasons in, it’s clear that its central love story isn’t the cow-eyed, star-crossed liaison between Lady Mary and her moody cousin, Matthew; nor the vaguely hostile and passive-aggressive flirtation between Lady Sybil and Branson, the resentful chauffeur; nor even the ardent yet relentlessly unfortunate relationship between Anna and Bates. The idealized romance at the heart of “Downton Abbey” is the symbiotic, interdependent bond between master and servant.<br /><br />Consider, for instance, the way Lady Grantham remains blissfully oblivious to all the schemes and collusions of O’Brien, her sour lady’s maid; in fact, Lady Grantham is so unfailing in her protection, her indulgence and her bovine looks of love and appreciation that her maid, shamed and humbled, repents all on her own. As for the Dowager Countess, she continues to avail herself of the superior attitude that is her due, but her snobbery tips so far into parody that it’s reduced to a harmless quirk. Cousin Matthew’s initial atavistic horror at acquiring lordly habits has eased, though he remains circumspectly humble. When they meet in the trenches, the lying, thieving footman Thomas makes Matthew a cup of tea and remarks, “What would my mother say, me, entertaining the future Earl of Grantham for tea?” Matthew humbly waves away the deferential compliment: “War has a way of differentiating between the things that matter and the things that don’t.” His own mother would be proud. After all, it has become her mission to turn Downton into a museum before its residents are properly embalmed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the kitchen, the proletariat won’t be kept down. Carson finds himself continuously swatting back chatter about revolutions and future brilliant careers. If it weren’t for Carson, staunch defender of the old social order, the whole apparatus might collapse into something like a coed dorm or a Swedish commune. Maybe part of what makes “Downton Abbey” so broadly appealing is that it’s so ideologically confusing, at least to American audiences. Much has been made of the fact that Julian Fellowes, the creator of the series, has been named a peer in the House of Lords, but he grew up observing the world of the landed gentry from the periphery as “a poor relation” on the debutante circuit, and his grandmother reportedly worked in a housemuch like Downton. (This makes his portrayalof the self-made Sir Richard as a villain even more interesting.) In its own weird way, it’s the perfect show for the present moment; a fantasy in which an enlightened overclass and a grateful underclass look deeply into each other’s eyes and realize that they need each other, that there’s a way for them to live together in perfect, symbiotic harmony. It’s a Hegelian fable in which master and servant recognize their mutual dependence and give in to it, realizing that in the grand scheme they are equal. It’s not so much a portrait of an era as it is an advertisement for an imagined ideal of an enlightened aristocracy whose conservatism included a sense of responsibility, not disdain, toward those dependent on it. Which, at this particular political moment, makes it just about the weirdest thing on American TV.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong. It has several different options on it and levels. It is definitely a good free game to have.
1476712042|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, read it in less than 2 days. The story line is good, a lot of love, but not as much heavy intercourse as in 50 Shades. I would recommend it!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not for everyone - lots of gore and things jumping out from around corners. Definitely a big hit all over the nation though.<br /><br />Love that I can watch the show the next day by signing up for the subscription - great for those of us without cable
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I love that the story is written through the Dog's point of view. It was a really nice read it just wasn't the most amazing of all times. I would still recommend it.
0375851569|5.0|My son who is 25 months loooves having us read these books to him before bed.  His favorites (so far) are Hop on Pop, Green eggs and Ham (or hammy as he calls it!) and One Fish, Two fish.  I'm sure he is a rarity in the toddler set that can sit still long enough to read all three of these.  He likes to point out pics and say what they are.  His newest favorite game is in Hop on Pop is to point to the dog on the page and call it a cat to be funny. What a nut. Last night, very clearly he pointed to the author and said \\"Dr. Seuss\\"...adorable!<br />Anyway, this a great set and I would like to get the second set in the near future.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I have already seen this movie enough to start quoting from it, but the wife was a non-comic movie watcher, and had an absolute blast. Of course the one seemingly non-critical death seems like the largest moment of regret in the movie. The acting is great there is awesome pacing, and of course, Joss really manages the camp with the quality all the way through. Can't believe this was made under the Disney roof.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|I'm not a big fan of blu-ray. I don't get excited by CGI. But to see Citizen Kane in glorious black and white, crisp as the day it was printed, was a real treat. The booklet is a cinephile's dream. The extras are pretty good. (The doc is little de-rezzy, but the great content makes that a sin you can forgive.) Overall, a real deal. I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the graphics!! So much better than the first temple run!! If you fell in love with temple run, you won't be able to put temple run 2 down! It's so freakin addicting! A must have for everyone!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Wonderful. The length is exactly what I wanted, and it works with my Kindle  as well as my Motorola smartphone.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Well acted, follows the book pretty closely.  A real joy for Austen fans with nice period sets, horses and homes.
030758836X|2.0|This was an easy read, which gives it 2 stars for me and not just 1.  I'm trying hard not to judge it too harshly...<br /><br />I did not enjoy the characters, the setting, or the backgrounds of the characters.  I kept reading because we lost power and midway through the book I actually started to wonder what happened to them.  I did enjoy the twists to some level, but it was overall disappointing in delivery.<br />Each person was so very simple, even the main characters.  It was like the author could imagine such people, but couldn't exactly get in their brains.  Like she was writing about terrible people to us \\"regular folks\\" and trying to figure out what they think in their minds, but missed the mark.  And it was just so stupid simple!  Not to overuse that word.  But for a person that is described as a sociopath and extremely smart, the chapters for that person did not ring true.  The issues dealing with men vs. women were stupid.  And, no, not just the issues themselves, just the way they were written.  It was on the level of casual bar talk, and this was supposed to be what an adult was thinking!<br />I don't know.  I bought this book because it had a good ratings and it sounded interesting, but maybe they should rate the books on a different level so you know if you are dealing with a fluff book like this vs. a book that you can really sink your teeth into.<br /><br />Biggest pet peeve of the book:<br />The author totally missed many opportunities here.  It was slow, slow, slow and then the ending just sped up and skipped over many great opportunities.  What is not said about their relationship was more interesting than what the author actually did say. It was ridiculous to miss those great writing moments. The parents and twin sister needed more attention at the end, as well.  Lazy...
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn's novels are always the best.  It has been wonderful following this characters in all of his stories.  The plots are always spellbinding.
B00005JSGK|5.0|John Wayne and lots of wild animals in the wilds of Africa (and a show stealing cheetah)<br />Hatari was my favorite movie as a child.  We obtained a copy of it in the 80's and my daughter wore it out, she loved it so much,  She now has two children.  Both love John Wayne movies and my grandson asked for Hatari for his 6th birthday.  This copy will probably be worn out too!
0399160450|5.0|As always Tom Clancy has written a marvelous novel.  The constant intrigue and action makes this book a collector's item.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|A lot of People in this world today preach the same crap that you can find yourself on the internet. Mark Cuban is a visionary - pure hearted and one of the brightest minds of the 21st century. If anyone who is lost in the works of business- read this book it will help you find your way back.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe is like the new X-files - we greatly enjoy all the mind-bending story elements, the charm and chemistry between the characters, and phenomenal acting!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Starts out really slow but gets very interesting.  I was hooked about half way through and wanted to finish it fast but I started getting annoyed.  Too many things were happening that were just too hard to believe and then it just ends.  I hate books that end that way, I need an actual finish to the story.  Not worth reading in my opinion!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A new perspective on success.  Gives the reader something to think about, but take into perspective.  I found it very interesting.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Having seen the movies first,the book was still a good read.  The pace was good with enough details to be interesting, but not too cumbersome.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Probably should buy this movie.  Streaming from Amazon is easy and it's nice not to have DVDs all over the house.  Nice long rental, was able to watch several times from various locations in the movie.  When you watch from home, you tend to move around and then need to rewind a lot.<br /><br />Don't need to think about a intricate plot.  Just a fund movie to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the most fun game I have ever played. I spend hours on this game every night.if you are doubting this game, go see a doctor because you are insane!
1439181780|5.0|A positively delightful book. I could not put it down. It's a book that will leave you uplifted. It's all about the amazing power of LOVE. After all Love is the greatest energy of all.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|When I bought the hardcopy there were 3 books. This ebook is one big file and the book covers are missing! Looks bad. Knowing that I would have rather bought each book by itself.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|This writer has obviously been there, done that.  His international settings are fascinating and the non-stop intrigue and action will keep you glued to the novel.  Don't miss this one.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was rather slow reading for me; however, the book was excellent and very well written I thought.  I enjoyed and appreciated the quality of the details illustrated.  Despite the complexity and the dynamics involved, the story was absolutely believable and thrilling.  I also enjoyed the characters and their interactions enormously; they were very well developed.  I watched the movie first, so there was no real surprise in terms of the progress as well as the ending unfortunately, but I truly enjoyed the book.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Mr. Martin seems to be diverting too much in endless plot twists and new characters storylines. I almost feel that he is getting tired of writing about Westeros and is losing his focus as a result.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I like it. It's something like Mario brothers and very addicted. My kids can play it to bc its that easy
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I am amazed at Jonathan's and Charlotte's talent.  I am enjoying their music and recommend them to anyone.  I have added them to my short list of favorites, with other talented artists such as Josh Groban, Il Volo, Russell Watson, and Susan Boyle.  I am looking forward to more from Jonathan and Charlotte.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I'm a big Steely Dan and Donald Fagen fan.  I think Sunken Condos is his best solo album yet- and that says a lot because I really like his others too.<br /><br />Pros: full of amazing songs<br /><br />Cons: I've listened to it so many times in 1 week that all the songs are stuck in my head (actually, this is a \\"Pro\\" too- there are no Cons)<br /><br />But it, play it, love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Any game that makes me think and think correctly I love. This one does this. Slow and easy at first but when it gets going it is very challenging.
1881273377|5.0|This audiobook was given to me many years ago by my parents. My boyfriend and I (now husband) both listened to it and it provided a lot of insight in to the way were wired. It gave us a common language to be able to speak to each other and communicate our needs. I highly recommend it for any couple at any stage in their relationship. It's also great for single people so that you can understand and be aware of your own love language.<br /><br />If you're like me and don't have time to read, this is the perfect type of book to be able to listen to in the car and still get a lot out of the message. I also really enjoyed the underlying spiritual principles and have purchased the children's versions for our boys.
B003297I1U|5.0|Although it's pricey, we have two boys and know they will get a lot of use out of it. There are a lot of moving parts which makes it more realistic. We can always count on Bruder to make a quality product.
B0084670FU|1.0|Thought since Brad Pitt was in the movie it would be decent but don't be fooled. Even though this was free on Amazon it still isn't worth wasting your time.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|Great story and actually rented it on Movie Channel first and decided I had to have it in my collection after watching it.
B009POCFTG|5.0|Strong sexual content but very well played.  The actors were great as was the plot.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I never saw the show in the beginning so it was fun to go and watch Season 1.  Now I'm hooked!  Can't wait to watch Season 2!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could have tweaked the ending a bit but otherwise, great reading!  Hats off to Gillian Flynn for a great book.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|A little smaller than what I expected but happy that I received it a week after my order. As most of us know, this set is hard to come by with the high demand and low inventory of this particular item...the kids love it.  It is a more challenging LEGO set to put together due to the high number of smaller pieces it uses.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a great listen or to have just as background music while doing work.  I Hope you enjoy it
B003H4RDZQ|5.0|The book shipped fast and well packed. The book comes with six new stories, the description says it does but I didn't see it so it was a nice little surprise. Great price for a great book.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Simply alluring and enchanting and at other times heart pounding. Such a wonderful range of emotion on this soundtrack. The movie really truly benefited from it. Great job Ian Shore!
006197806X|5.0|So perfect. Though I saw the 'twists' coming a mile away, when they did happen it was still pretty awesome! I really enjoyed this book and Requiem is only a month away. yay.
1455502758|5.0|I just finished reading Hitchens' fine last book. I have been an atheist since the age of 10, with a few detours into agnosticism. I am still in fairly good health for the age of 69, but I can feel my body slowly breaking down. There is no empirical evidence for the existence of the being described as \\"God.\\" There is more and more evidence that the universe and our existence as sentient self-aware beings is a cosmic accident. If God existed, It would be a monster of the worst imagining. (The insoluble problems for those optimists who want to believe in a benevolent God and a happy afterlife) are the obvious existence of evil and suffering. I suppose it is irrational, and truth is difficult to discern, but my value is to seek truth and eschew delusion as best I can. Many religious believers seek to convert people as they are close to death and take sadistic delight in getting people in fear and pain to say, \\"I believe! I believe!\\" Hitchens was a brilliant and admirable man. Certainly not perfect. Certainly did not pretend to be be perfect and free of error. To the very last he strove for truth and exemplified his values. I hope to do the same when my sad last moments arrive.
0553801473|2.0|Why did this series have to turn into such a let down and drag? It was seriously \\"out of this world\\" good when I was introduced to it over 10 years ago. I have no idea how I actually finished reading A Feast for Crows, don't remember nor want to remember any of it, and absolutely will not re-read it. The feeling was as bad as shoving classics down a high-schooler's throat many of us can quickly relate to. I remember telling myself surely this is just pain we all have to endure to get to his next great book, hey no problem I can live with that. Then my hope was lost again in this \\"dizzy\\" dance with dragons. Since when did this series need a bunch of filler and fluff, that goes off into unnecessary tangents while at the same time slowing down the progress of the important plots, to simply advance the foundation of a great story? Why Why Why, when so many people were captivated by such a rock solid fantasy world that was imaginative yet seemed so real with believable plots and schemes. It was hands down the best series I read and owned, definitely the cream of the crop in my collection, even boasted to friends about it. Now the only way I could keep my eyes open were short spurts of excitement of limited sections following Jon's developments and Stannis' actions, can't remember much else because it hurts to try and even care to. Between both books, following Bran, Arya, Jaime and Tyrion among others have lost their luster, because their developments and lack of progress equate to simply uneventful. I never thought I'd have to take a timeout from a series that used to be so solid, to the point of a \\"good riddance\\" feeling to finish these last 2 installments. And after spending so long toting it around and muttling thru I'm afraid I've lost my excitement to watch season 3 of GOT nor read anymore of this series until it's actually wrapped up.<br /><br />If this keeps up we're looking at a turn for the worse like Jordan and I'm concerned Martin won't live to finish the work himself either if he continues down this path. But Fortunately that can be avoided if he reads these reviews and complaints from his fan base we can only hope, to respark fantasy storytelling in its finest form again. I'm definitely not getting roped into buying multiple mediocre, senseless, filler material upon their release dates if this continues. Nor am I giving up on this series entirely, but I am disappointed into what has become of it, and like others really hope it turns around. Sorry if I spoiled any moods here, fix this Martin!
B008MEM24S|5.0|The game is fun, always entertaining, and sometimes challenging.<br />My 4 year old loves to play it for hours .
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie was way better than I thought it would be.  I'm not a big MMA fan but the acting and the story were powerful.  Highly recommended!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great series.  I can't believe I missed this when it was originally broadcast. Highly recommend this and the following seasons.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|For the Kindle dependant-the Battery HD is absolutely invaluable. Not only does it briefly interrupt my activity to notify me when my battery has reached a level(s) I set, but it also estimates the remaining usage for various activities: surfing, downloading, streaming etc. I love it!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I chose this book because I love historical books and movies.  I am half-way through this book and I have not read a thing about Osama at this point.  I am not really interested in his history in the Seals.
B001I8A76A|4.0|If I was familiar with Pink's music my rating would have been a 5. I enjoyed listening to all of the songs.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I loved the movie at the cinema but I have not received it from you as a DVD as yet.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was caught up in the characters from almost the first page. John Green has an excellent ear and flair for getting the tone of teenager thoughts just right. And even though the lead doesn't always behave the way you hope, you can't help but love her. The first two-thirds of the book flew by, and it was hard to stop reading even for a minute. The last third got caught up a bit in trying to resolve the plot, and it wasn't quite as effective, though still able to pack an emotional punch. Adolescent love, parental love, aging with regrets are all covered here, and as well and effectively as I can remember. Great book.
0783230079|5.0|I actually bought it for my son as one of his Christmas presents.  It is a fabulous movie and Robert Downey Jnr is unreal.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have always liked Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels. This one is a thriller from start to finish. I will most likely read it again. Good story line, a tiny bit twisted plot. You really do not know how it will all work out, but it does in a most unpredictable fashion. I like the parallel story lines and how he moves them all in unison without missing a beat. Great book...this one would have moviegoers at the edge of their seats (Is Harrison Ford still available?)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A  very interesting and fascinating account of one, very unusual, but true story born out of WWII and the meeting of the adversaries many years later.
B008OE05IG|5.0|I had heard of this documentary before and kept it in my queue. Just loved the dedication of Jiro in coming from humble beginnings to truly perfecting the art of the sushi. Its a testament to the man's dedication to become the best there is and is truly inspirational. Definitely worth the time.
0765356139|5.0|The Well of Ascension picks up on the same high note that The Final Empire left off on.  However, Sanderson has significantly improved his writing between the books.  While it's not quite on the same level of character interaction that more established authors have reached, he falls more towards old hand than novice now.<br /><br />While one would think that the death of Kelsier would hinder the book, but it actually proves to be a bit of a non-factor.  Vin and Elend are able to drive the book forward, while the secondary characters provide for welcomed changes of perspective.  They don't merely repeat what we already know, instead they add different perspectives about events as well as details that may have escaped the notice of other characters.<br /><br />However this is only half the books charm.  The rest of it comes from the continuing development of alomancy as well as the never predictable plot.  Allomancy continues to be one of the best and most intriguing magic systems in all of fantasy.  The realism involved with how it works, as well as the uses for specific areas of it make it incredibly fun to read about.  When taking into account the expanding uses and descriptions that we are given, it shows a lot of promise to be one of the best out there.<br /><br />The other significantly bettered part of this book is the plot.  In the first book it seemed a bit of a tried and true formula.  Evil emperor A has to be killed by Hero A.  Hero A gives his life in order to try and help the cause, and this allows for Hero B to emerge as the savior of everything.  The Well of Ascension though really adds another dimension.  We begin to learn a lot more about the Lord Ruler, and discover that he might not be such a bad guy.  Elend faces the trials and tribulations of being a king, and Vin is left to discover what her place is in all of this.<br /><br />Overall, The Well of Ascension is a huge improvement upon the Final Empire, and that's very impressive.  I enjoyed the first book of Mistborn very much, but the second could hold a special place as one of my favorite books.<br /><br />5/5rst book of Mistborn very much, but the second could hold a special place as one of my favorite books.<br /><br />5/5
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves it. It has step by step instructions that even she can follow. She was very proud of herself that she was able to build the same house that is on the picture, all by herself. And that is what toys should be for help her learn to do stuff by herself. Very happy with the purchase.
0765350386|4.0|Where to start, where to start.  The Mistborn trilogy as a whole is by far one of the most impressive series I've read.  Made all the more impressive by the fact that Sanderson is new to the game.  However, he clearly has a true passion for the genre which makes it a delight to read.  There's a difference between people who like the idea of writing a genre, and people who are head over heels in love with the genre, and write to fulfill what they want to read.  While this might sometimes lead to poorly thought out stories with self insert characters, you can rest assured that this is not the case for Sanderson.<br /><br />Instead, it results in one of the most realistic \\"magic\\" systems that can be thought of.  Instead of physics being defied because \\"it's magic\\", the two work together.  A common instance used throughout the story is that when using allomancy, if you push on metal then there is an equal and opposite push against yourself from the metal.  If this doesn't make much sense to you, it's probably because you are still reading this review and not delving into the world of allomancy.  Shame on you, and hop to it!<br /><br />Now that I've gotten all of my gushing out of over The Final Empire, I do have to admit that it isn't perfect.  The characters can be a bit shallow at times, and the dialogue stilted.  It does improve as Sanderson seems to find his groove, but there are phrases and situations that jar the reader out of the immersive world that he's built.  It's by no means enough to make me want to stop reading it, but it can be annoying.  The book also takes a little while to get built up.  The backstory is extremely deep, and as such the first book takes a little while to get off the ground.  We find out about a variety of characters without ever really getting a feeling as to who they are or why they're important.<br /><br />By about a third of the way through the book though, this issue is long gone.  Instead the focus is upon the wondrous system of allomancy.  The premise of allomancy is that \\"burning\\", or digesting metals, allows certain special individuals to gain specific powers associated with that type of metal.  E.G. Pewter makes someone stronger and heal faster while being burned.  The refreshing part of this system though is that the magic is not based upon individual capacities.  Instead, those who are able to do it are all of the same \\"power.\\"  Now, there are a few exceptions to this later on in the series, but as a whole Sanderson does a good job of making allomancy a tool and not something that changes.  In addition, it works with physics instead of defying physics.<br /><br />Overall Sanderson's first venture into the Mistborn series was a giant success.  It sets up the next book very nicely, and was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />4/5lomancy.

0307895475|4.0|Before I bought this book, I used the wiki as a primary source of information for the game. Overall, it compares quite well as a resource.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good organization (consolidated charts/tables of enemies, weapons, armors, unique items)<br />-Detailed maps with important locations identified<br />-Thorough walk-throughs for areas/quests<br />-Character creation guide complete with skills and perk trees<br />-Bonus full-world poster/map with all locations marked as they are in the book<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Index is somewhat difficult to use, especially for finding the \\"primary\\" page for a person/quest/item (as the book is huge and most topics are mentioned on several pages at least)<br />-No mention of potential bugs (or fixes) that can sometimes be game-breaking<br />-Often not as easy to quickly search for something (especially something relatively minor like a sidequest reward item or minor NPC) as the wiki<br /><br />Overall, it's a very solid book. It's well put-together with nice thick pages and good binding. It's an interesting read even while not playing the game, and the maps above all things are invaluable; I don't know what I would have done without the Soul Cairn map from Dawnguard, for example. Nothing in that area is quest-marked in the game apart from the primary objective (there are several side missions there), so the book's detailed map saved me potentially hours of wandering about.<br /><br />Also, the price here is about $10 cheaper than retail store price, which is definitely worthwhile. Recommended for big Skyrim fans, but probably not so much for someone who is just playing more casually and isn't that invested in the game/series.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|Came with the purchase of my Kindle<br />Did not read the book for two years until I got curious...<br />Why did I wait so long, it was a real treasure to read.<br />By now most would know the plot but the intensity and beauy of the style with which this book was written puts it in my top ten favourite books.<br />A must read !!!!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Great movie with non stop action!  The language is a little rough but otherwise a fabulous movie! I highly recommend it!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Family and friends love this series. Shows you nature in all its glory. Animals spring to life on the big screen. Photography on earth and below the oceans is as magnificent as it is educational. Absolutely spectacular.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is amazing. There are great graphics and its a lot of fun but it takes longer to load and glitches a lot. but it is still great!
B000E5KJD4|5.0|Boy, do I love the leading lady. What a fantastic musical DVD. Colourfull and detailed with music to die for. Costumes, sets, acting, all wonderfull. I would never part with this DVD and have watched it many times with family and friends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great graphics.  intriging. story.  you can go to hints when you are really STUCK to show you where to go next. it was a pleasure to play
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book with amazingly descriptive detail. This  book was not  only interesting but a source of history all in one.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv! I never watched it until it started on TNT but I have fallen in love with ALL the characters!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great music  Pay attention to the lyrics...very poetic and heartfelt.  An exciting group.  I would love to see them live.  I also loved Sigh No More their first cd.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As always, Downton never disappoints!<br /><br />Wish there wasn't such a long break in the season!  The finale is a shocker for season 3!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|We enjoy the Christmas Carol renditions every year, but I had never read the original to see how they all stack up.  It's been great!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Such an interesting and fun book to read.  The bits of wisdom make so much sense and I am not sure where else I would have gotten this information.  I plan to try some of the ideas on my youngest son, with hope that they might work on my older children also.
B005LAII80|2.0|I don't get why this movie gets Hugh marks here in amazon.  Rented it last night. It was definitely reminiscent of an 80's Robo Cop, but without all the nudity. If you're on the fence, pass.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|My 6 and 9 year old girls received this as a present and they love it!  Swift keeps it clean.
B00683JK9K|4.0|The graphics are great. The choice of puzzles is good. The choice of difficulty is good. The only downside is the rotation choice of the puzzle pieces. It is very aggravating to get a piece to rotate. Also, I started a master puzzle and wanted to finish it later. I reopened the app and all my progress was gone. This happened on several occassions.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one of his best!  Enjoyed!  I could not put 'The Racketeer' down until I finished.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was so entertaining and a pleasure to read i really enjoyed it and im looking forward to reading more of his books
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I expected high quality. I was not disappointed.  My wife and I look forward to your future productions.  Excellent quality in all areas. We are great fans of Maggie Smith!
1416594795|5.0|I own a few of Dawkin's book and this one, by far, is the best.  Why?  It's written so the average person can read it.  i.e. The Blind Watchmaker, is over my head.  This one traces out evolution in an undeniable way with color photos to boot.  If you're reading this review, then buy the book.  I'm very glad I did.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Film had potential till the end, where DW shows his human side and tells the truth, landing himself in jail.<br />Turned out to be a boring morality play about the evils of excessive drink.<br />Could have ended much better, by having good-guy DW lie with the others to get off the hook, then agonized privately afterwards.<br />The viewer could then have been left in doubt as to whether he might have confessed after the fact.
0765325950|5.0|Finally, the end of the story. Great finish to the Wheel of Time Series. I was satisfied as to the ending. I would highly recommend to others.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|He is a particularly good author who always presents good ideas in an understandable way. Once again he has done this in this novel.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Keeps you turning the page.  Great story with intriguing characters.  Very satisfying and would highly recommend to avid historical romance readers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Although nobody believes I find this show extremey comical, also Maggie Smith does a great job in infusing the smart comments
B009UX2YAC|3.0|great game and kids fight over who can play.,but it will lose all the save data. all coins And characters earned will reset randomly. still fun to play.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain intersperses research figures and real life stories in an informative and entertaining read. My wife read it first and said, &#34; I saw you in there! You are a 'poised introvert' &#34; After I read, I had to agree. Almost everyone else thinks of me as an extrovert. You may be surprised at where you fit in the spectrum from extrovert and introvert.
0765365278|5.0|When I bought \\"A Memory of Light\\" last month I believed this will be my last book order overseas. Martin is great, but I can bear waiting for my language version a few months and avoid paying for shipment. But along with the last Wheel of Time novel, I also purchased this.<br /><br />And so it seems I am still going to be an amazon.com customer.<br /><br />The vision of a new world that emerges from the pages--and imagination of the author--is powerful. Vast. \\"Original\\" does not do it justice. Amazing, how it leaves you eager to discover more.<br /><br />Against this bacground we have fascinating set of characters and enthralling plot--though I am hesitant to judge it, as the book is obviously only the first installment in a long series. But so far, it does not lack anything.<br /><br />I have read some other reviews and I agree that there might be slightly too much exposition of Kaladin (one of the main characters), but other supposed flaws - \\"too long\\", \\"not enough action\\" \\"black or white\\" or \\"elements of racism\\" are either outright lies or they were written by critics temporarily [ok, edit: indisposed]. It is not too long, though true, it is slightly difficult to read without at least one night's sleep around page 500. It has plenty, plenty of action. It is *not* black and white, but neither it is only about 'lost' characters who can never tell right from wrong (as if that were realistic!). Racism - lol...<br /><br />5/5<br />Buy it. You will enjoy it.
B000SZK41M|5.0|As a cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, McClain does the near impossible without appearing super-human, just super motivated. Willis' glints of humor shine through often enough to make you think that you would like to know this guy.
0765325950|5.0|I understand why hundreds of readers voted 1 star for this book. It had to do with the kindle version being rescheduled for later--but even if Mr Jordan's wife turned out to be somewhat greedy, I cannot, will not, in good conscience rate this any lower than 5.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson did wonderful job finishing the series and I honestly doubt Jordan himself would do much better. Judging from how he got lost in the VII-IX books of the series, perhaps he would do worse. As it is, we have a wonderful and satisfactory ending to the series that accompanied many of us since the early 90s, We get to say 'farwell' to all important - or not-so-important, but loved characters. Yes, you could say that some things were not fully resolved, some answers were evaded. But not many. Just enough to give you a feel that it was an entire *world* that we are saying farwell to.<br /><br />Prepare for hundreds of pages of battle and action. Prepare for answers. Prepare for a few sleepless nights!
0399160450|4.0|A mess of interlocking plots featuring evil geniuses, amoral mercenaries, not quite innocent pawns, betrayals. The worst part is the suspicion that this could happen with todays technology.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This was one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down. Love this author.
B000244EMO|3.0|That's basically it, i mean i like WIDESCREEN movies but this is NOT widescreen... still a great flick though. The film quality like people are saying is dated but i still love it, that's part of the reason why i like to watch older movies. To see how they looked before i was born.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I wrote this right as i started the film, but as the film progresses i realize how BAD the audio is. Its either too hard to hear or too loud. Three stars now.
B001URCM44|5.0|Yanni's music is so soothing and just lovely to listen to.  It's the kind of music you just want to sit and enjoy.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Original and spellbinding, this is reading time well spent.  Similar in texture to &#34;Water for Elephants,&#34; this book weaves a spell and is extremely hard to put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game so far. Interaction is great and fun to play. Can be a little confusing at first. But has been alot of fun so far.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|I LOVE THE HUMOR, THE ROMANCE, THE ACTION.  MATHEW BRODERICK IS FANTASTIC, MICHELE PFIEFER IS ANGELICALLY BEAUTIFUL - LOVE IT!!!!!!
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Increíble, la verdad.  A mí me encantó.  Soy maestro de español en una escuela secundaria y esta película no es para estudiantes de ninguna forma.  Pero bueno, la miré yo sólo y me encantó, creo que la actuación es impresionante.  Hace mucho tiempo que veo a Banderas en una película española y es genial.  Te recomiendo que mires esta película con buena Rioja y que te pongas a mirarla.  Vale la pena, es buenísima.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Brooks' ethnographic format created a realistic portrayal of a fictional event: an apocalyptic zombie war.  In fact, it could be downright disturbing at times--but I kept reading.  With Brooks interviewing key players in the war, but looking back, it was easy to imagine the scenarios presented by each person.  In some of the interviews, you could replace zombie war with any major epidemic or cataclysmic event to see how society deteriorates.  While reading the book, I was constantly asking myself, `would I be able to survive?'  Hell, after witnessing some of the things described, would I want to survive?
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Great book. Been telling everyone they must read this book. Gave me a great sense of peace and contentment in challenging times. Glad to have it in my library to reread.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful book. It made me cry. I'd recommend this book for sensitive, young readers in 5th through 7th grades. Also a wonderful book for parents to read to their children before bed, with themes of kindness, greatfullness,and humility woven throughout.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|What ever happen to the real Denzel, I see why his wife did not care for this.<br /><br />I want my money and time back, I purchased this movie thinking it was going to be a thriller/ mystery which the back states \\"nail-biting thriller... No way, I would rather watch Scooby Doo..<br /><br />The nude scene was pure trash and uncalled for. There was no need to have a scene so distasteful. There was no need for the all the bad language, over kill on the drugs and alcohol use. Story line/plot the dots did not connect.<br /><br />Yes pilot's who drink are a problem, but I would rather see a solution focused movie on how to solve that problem than one that shows the nude, drug etc.. Pilots drinking and using drugs is a real problem. And this happens in real life, nothing to play with.<br /><br />Addiction is real, and nothing to play with, yes this shows what an addict looks like, goes through, etc. However I would have rather have seen something more tasteful. Denzel performance was great as usual, which is the reason we purchased the movie as it has a great cast.<br /><br />I tried to give this movie to a family member and they told me no thanks.<br /><br />Denzel is one of my favorite actors and we own most of his movies. We liked him in out of time, unstoppable, the good movies.<br /><br />Denzel don't lower your standards for a movie roll, you are top quality keep it that way. This was way different, we understand the addiction, but the nude scene was distasteful. Keep it classy and not trashy.<br /><br />Would not want to leave a movie like this behind for generations to see. Legacy is everything.<br /><br />We should have purchased Taken 2, Skyfall, Avengers, etc.<br /><br />Yes the movie has rated R on the back, many movies do, but the content is not like this.<br /><br />Keep your money. This movie is not worth renting or streaming either.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Wow. The art is seamless, the music is unobtrusive... definitely innovative. I'm not so sure the young ones will be quick enough (with some of the \\"maneuvering\\" that certain levels require). But it's by all other means kid friendly if they want to play. As an adult, I enjoy the game play- I even found it relaxing.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Very good gameplay, very original, good music, awesome free app of the day, I would recommend this game, for all ages
B007M45PMU|4.0|Buy it! This is a great album from a great band. If you don't own it yet you should! I love them!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Although it seems like a long read, Martin tells the story via short chapters with a focus on a single character- so even if you find one chapter less exciting, you're still reading on to continue another thread of the story line. I'm a total fan of the series, and the HBO show- you never know how the story will change next! It's dramatic, suspenseful, triumphant, sad, happy and dare I say sexy (?) all at once. Just take the plunge and read it, you won't regret it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone to read. It is a great read, flows well and has great perspective on life.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|It starts off with an amazing airline crash.  The rest is the story of a person who is destroying himself, because he thinks he can control his demons with no one's help.  In  the end, though,  he redeems himself and tries to help others. I love Denzel and I'm sure I would have watched it just to see his smile, but the movie is great, full of suspense and many surprises .
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First off - this is a great movie.  Everything from the characters to the plot to the graphics is great.  I love the combo pack because of the versatility and I didnt realize until after I had given this to my fiance that this also came with a digital music download.  Just one of those awesome  perks.  This was definitely the best deal out there for this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was exiting and that kind of book that has you at the end of the seat every time. It was awesome.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Gripping story of it is never too late. Realizing how you can reclaim lost connections.Once I started reading, I could not put it down. Started reading on take off from Philadelphia airport, finished when I landed in Las Vegas.
B001OSIV62|2.0|We know he survives the adventure, so this is not a spoiler. The ending after this great triumph fell so flat. Chalk it up to human selfishness.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I was recommended the Reacher series by a friend. I was told it would be great holiday reading and she was right. Knocked it off in a couple of days. Great page turner. Not deep, but we'll written for the genre. Tom Cruise just doesn't cut the figure of Jack Reacher. The book has ruined the movie.
1118109791|4.0|I am a math tutor. I wrote a GMAT test-pre book on amazon and very familiar with the test. This official guide is a good resource for tutors and test-takers. Some of the math solution explanations are unclear and hard to understand by my students, even myself. The GMAT math covers only the basic math areas with arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and word problems. It is not necessary to emphasize the ranking of difficulty on each math question, just need practice, practice, and practice.
0385344228|2.0|This story started off well but I never could relate to any of the characters or the story itself. It is a disturbing story that is never fully developed. Why would Jacob even possibly kill his classmate is never fully developed. No character was believable and I truly felt the author had written the story during the wrong time period.  With numerous references to an 8th grade student using Twitter and Facebook in 2007, it just did not make sense in many cases. If I remember correctly, MySpace was more prevelant in 2007 and who heard of Twitter in 2007?  I was very disappointed in this book, unfortunately.  Good premise for a story but not believable or fully developed.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Love blue ray love this movie loved the price!!!!!! couldn't have been happier!! got it two days before it was even suppose to be here!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I are really enjoying this show.  It slowed down a little halfway through season two, but it has been picking up!
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Usually I can't find the same fulfillment in short stories as in novels... but Lahiri's writing is beautiful and accomplishes in several pages what other writers need many chapters to do--she makes you care for her characters. As a grown woman with three children of my own, I marvel that Lahiri is able to take me back so completely to my relationship with my parents, my childhood, my culture... it is not surprising but still unifying to realize how much Indian culture has in common with my own European family back story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire was my favorite card game when I was a youngster.  This game is easy to play and challenging.  There is a hint button on there in case you get  stuck.  It is very enjoyable to play.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I like the ebb and flow of the story and the thought provoking way that the character lived out his life in the past.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Fun & silly.  Good when you need a laugh.  Very cute and a good way to make someone laugh when they need a good laugh.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Middle school is a challenge for anyone, but if you are a little different than the average kid, it can be filled with a lot of downs and few ups until you find your niche.  August is the one who is challenged in one sense, but everyone else is challenged to accept him in spite of his obvious differences from other kids. A Fun and cheerful book to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome to play and escape the cops as you dodge trains and sign was you race to get coins riding hover boards
0143119680|4.0|\\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is about as high quality as paranormal (meaning it includes supernatural beings like witches and vampires) romance/fantasy gets. At rare junctures stilted writing or overly contrived plot developments pulled me out of the reverie, but I found myself largely lost in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is really fun and entertaining. I play this game almost every single day as. You also earn coins to get other characters. I love subway surfer.
B003YOMNCM|4.0|Nice playing but the piece is an example of academic classical music.  The third movement is worth waiting for but Hahn's tone is a bit too thin at times.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|i read part one and thought it was amazing. Even though the length can be daunting, you will find your self anxiously turning each page. I read a lot of Ken Follett but i like his sagas the best. Can't wait for part 3.
B005H29GSI|4.0|My kids love Angry Birds. They would play all day if we let them. So, of course, they love playing with REAL angry birds.<br /><br />This set had the red angry bird, the yellow angry bird, and 3 pigs. (Each pig has a different face.) There are also 2 hard hats for the pigs. This set comes with several breaking blocks (ice) and a TNT box the pops open. You also get a big slingshot of the birds.<br /><br />My kids don't like playing by the actual game rules. They prefer to take turns setting up the blocks with the pigs on them and then knocking them down. They occasionally use the cards to set up their block formations, but they usually wing it. And no one ever keeps score.<br /><br />The pigs faces are stickers in this set. So, they can/do come off if you get them wet or the toddler decides to munch on them. The pigs in this set are hard plastic and the birds are soft \\"rubber ducky\\" plastic.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This one is worth the time. We enjoyed it from beginning to end. Great performances by the actors and a storyline that hasn't been done to death already.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like season three because there is more of the household intrigue that was interesting in season one but absent in season two. Now we have a better understanding of the characters and their strengths and weaknesses so it's even more interesting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is completely addictive. I've played for hours. Just  did not want to put it down. Can't cheat or be cheated. Lol
B0007LGCA4|5.0|Product is great.  My husband has worn same exact shoe for 7 years.  Needed to re-order.  Unfortunately his foot has widened over the years and it was too narrow.  Wanted to exchange it but does not come in a wider size so had to return.  Sorely disappointed
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first game both my husband and I tried with our new Kindle Fire HD!  It's fun and challenging.
0761169431|4.0|These are very cool but more difficult than they might seem.  My son has difficulty completing them on his own, but once they're done they're pretty cool!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was turned onto this game by a very intelligent 7 year old.  It is a lot of fun and when you get to the harder rounds it makes you think.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just can't get enough of this book, the characters, or the emotions. Each book leaves you wanting more and more!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I like the high production value, the complicated story and fast action.<br />I'm not particularly fond of Tom Cruise, but in a context like this, he is competent, if not totally believable in the role.<br />I give it an A-.
B0030B624E|5.0|this is one of my favorit zombie movies, the rules make me laugh every time, and Bill Murry is the best.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The story started very well. It then became a cheesy, harry potter wannabe and I could barely bring myself to finish it. And the whole glorification of Google got very tedious as well. I mean come on, Google working on the secret to eternal life, time machines etc? Over the top.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|this book was not the best i have read bout at least you tried.good luck jeff kinney on the next book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy read Not too many characters As always a surprise at the end Not your typical lawyer vs some big company
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|i consider this one of the best book ever for kids. great job jeff kinney on the best book ever.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|I have nearly all of Nelson DeMille books and I have always enjoyed them and particularly the John Corey stories, however this one was really disappointing. Whereas before Corey would make the occasional humorous wise crack now he comes across as a know-all xenophobic smart ass. If you're not from the good ol' USA you might as well be a neanderthal. Besides that the book is about twice as long as it needs to be. I probably will buy another DeMille book in the hope that he can return to form, but if it turns out to be as bad as this one it will unfortunately be the last.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW. I.m reading this again.Now! I think that says it all. I have never read a book twice! So good!
B005H9B44A|4.0|When they announced this film was coming I could not imagine how they would turn on Thor into a workable, cool character that people would identify with! I was very happily surprised at how well this script allows him to be both the foreign, yet familiar with various aspects of the human condition. Lots of great action, and a beautiful romantic story as well. Everyone should enjoy this movie.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Because it was simply one of the most insane truly frightening books I have ever read. I have been reading king since I was nine and first stole a copy of It from my mother. I was terrified for weeks but never told anyone. I thought I had read everything king had ever written even as Bachmann but I missed this one book now it is complete.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's a fun, simple, cute, and free. This is definitely a game to play and recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Boring, predictable, far fetched! Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring. Absolutely boring!
B007SGM084|1.0|Only kept reading because it was already on my Kindle. Not a very interesting series. Probably would have been much better as a single book. The actual story line was actually pretty good, but totally buried.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Enjoyed very much and plan on reading the rest of the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I was able to figure out the story about the 2nd chapter.  I really liked how the spirt of the deceased wife plyed such a powerful role.
B009K916ZK|1.0|I'm going to return this.  It stopped working after three uses.  We'll see how the replacement does, but I'm not impressed so far.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book leaves you wanting to know more about Gideon's past but hopefully it will soon be revealed in the 3rd book.
B0085OELXK|5.0|Far more erudite people have written reviews of this movie, and I have nothing new to add.  The effect on me was riveting, electric, disconcerting, distinctly ill-at-ease.  Yet it is an exceedingly well done movie from all aspects: lighting is carefully fit to each seen. Cinematography is superb; acting beyond Oscar-worthy.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie, especially since I was very non-committal about it after reading some reviews.  I think I agree with Roger Ebert's review most, and he loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can you say about a classic to pass time away and that works your mind at the same time to solve the game.
B0097L29KM|5.0|(VINYL)<br /><br />For those who, like me, listened to Zuma, followed it with On the Beach, then back to Zuma, you'll think you hit heaven.  A few of the songs on this album are reminiscent of the best of those two, and you'll feel a great sense of continuity.  Me, I feel a sense of gratitude that Neil decided to make this available on vinyl -- and audiophile vinyl, for that matter.<br /><br />I needn't go on about the music, because it's all a matter of taste.  So I'll restrict my review to the sound of the record.<br /><br />It is superior.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|It does not have a subject. It's not even entertaining. I don't understand why Denzel accepted to do this movie. I love his movies but not this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought I had it figured out 1/4 of the way through it.  Then I had doubts...Lots of twists and surprises.  Scary character.  You figure out which one.
B00APJLX8E|1.0|I can't stand movies where they focus more on the animation than the story - not very good and acting was so- so
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Excellent 1080 streaming quality and I love the Amazon interface.  Being able to stop and start the show as needed sure is handy.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Action, Humor, Great Dialogue, Thought-Provoking concepts and story-line.  Cowboys, Spaceships, who could ask for anything more?  Definitely worth having in your collection!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's A Great Season So Twisted And Its Suspenseful. There Are New Characters And New Stories To Be Told In This Season.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|What a great book!  While the Toltec imagery and approach had me raising an eyebrow now and then, I took a breath, relaxed and gave myself a chance to learn something new.  I'm so glad that I did!  I have recommended this book to several people already, and will continue to do so.  Currently I'm reading its follow-up, &#34;The Fifth Agreement&#34;.  That's another winner!
B00271HAK8|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies.  We have watched it over and over again an never get bored with it!
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I bought my copy locally, probably based on seeing TV ads since I missed it in the theaters. The story is actually pretty good, especially for teen fiction, I've watched my copy more than once and don't get tired if it.<br />Resemblance to the book &#34;I am number Four&#34; is the usual Hollywood adaptation, much of each (book or movie) has nothing to do with the other- but the story has lots of action and impressive FX work.<br />I wouldn't mind a sequel, actress Teresa Palmer (in one of the extras) evidently thought there were hopes of one- but I doubt that we'll see one- I haven't heard word of anything. The way the book series is progressing a movie series would've grown increasingly expensive to produce anyway.<br />Good set of extras, well worth watching, the DVD (haven't  watched the Blu ray) has excellent color and clarity.<br />Easily worth spending a couple of hours watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never thought I would read this but so glad I did.  Can't wait to see the movie next and can't wait to read the sequels
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Very nice stylus.  It has a removable cap with pocket clip.  There are 3 different size tips, one on each end of stylus, and one on end of cap.  I had been looking for a stylus with a smaller tip and this fits the bill.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|twitter is the best way to connect and interact instantly and share interests. Its totally entertaining and you get to see what your fav celebs are doing!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I never got to see the first few shows so watching them this way is just great. I have a Sony Bravia and strteaming to it is almost flawless. It does have to buffer sometimes but that is probably a local issue with my cable provider.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|well if your like me and you like to see everything at once to save time than this app is for you!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|The movie was great!  Even though Mel is a little out of his mind at times, he can still make a good movie.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is one of my very favorite series on TV and I love watching it each week.  I've purchased all the seasons so far and am waiting for the newest to be released.  Hope this continues for a long time.
B008N2Z1L0|3.0|It looks like I'm in the minority, judging from so many glowing reviews on here, but for me this new album by the Wallflowers was a disappointment. A frustrating mix of great songs and mediocre ones. My least favorite song on here is the opening track, \\"Hospital for Sinners.\\" Interesting lyrics, but the musical composition is just boring and repetitive. The two cuts with Mick Jones (from the Clash and Big Audio Dynamite) are better, but they sound out of place within the context of the other songs on this album. But then on track 6 --- finally --- the Wallflowers deliver a truly great song with \\"Love is a Country\\" and you wonder why the rest of the songs couldn't be this potent and wonderful. Really, that song towers over everything else on this album. They hit the mark again with \\"Constellation Blues,\\" another track that ranks with one of their best, but for me those two outstanding songs don't redeem the dullness of many of the other tracks on here. Okay, maybe that's too harsh; the rest of the tracks aren't all dull, but compared to some of the truly impressive songs that the Wallflowers have recorded over the years, many of these new songs just don't reach the same lofty heights. And I was hoping for more of that old magic on this new album.
B001FW58D6|5.0|Why?  Because of the characters.  I can't say I was ever emotionally invested in Scully, Mulder, or Skinner, but you grow to really care for the characters in Fringe - Walter, Peter, Olivia, Charlie, and even Broyles.  Several episodes even made me cry.  It's a show as much about human relationships as it is about science fiction (with a dash of humor thrown in).  Anna Torv is outstanding in her role as Olivia Dunham, which turns out to be quite a versatile part.  Dr Walter Bishop is such a complex character - at times exuberant, vulnerable, humorous, and even menacing - all aspects are masterfully portrayed by John Noble.  I'm so addicted, I'm racing through the episodes like there's no tomorrow.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|I really enjoy the game. I wish there was another type of level to play like Super Monsters Ate My Condo for the android products
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, it is crazy fun. Im still learning all the tricks to play this game have enjoyed it. I hate to put it down.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this App. Makes it so easy to carry a good book with you. No need for a paper book or a tablet
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is a typical Denzel movie. Gritty and harsh at times. In the end, an interesting story that I'd recommend to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subaway surer is a really fun game.If. you want to entertain your kid get this game.We let my daughter play an she is silent when she plays.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed The Guerney Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, thought it an interesting way to tell a story through letters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book!!!! OMG it's the best thing i have like every read!!!!!! I can't wait to read the rest of the books!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|First person is a strangely difficult way to write, but Mme. MORGENSTERN has done nobly.  More important, the characters are intensely interesting and fun to get to know.  The scenes are charming and the charms are scenic.  I found myself caring very much how it would turn out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I bought all 3 of these books and have read them twice. All I can say is WOW..I have suggested them to all my friends.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Just another unbelievable thriller with heros doing impossible things in a boring and an unlikely fantasy scenario.  The novelty is that this time the hero is a girl with amazing forest survival skills. Nothing interesting int he story, not badly written, it is a pitty that the author did not find a more interesting or credible story to use in her saga.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is the only thing I play on my kindle now I just got it and love it but could have more description in direction that could help but kinda don't get the  point of intuitive to make the building any way I like I mean buildings
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|simple, powerful, good. No problems whatsoever. Installed it and was browsing my phone files. Very much enjoyed using it. Thanks
B0093FNZT6|4.0|a good read and one to make you think. There is no where that the Lord can not go even when the doctors say 'no hope'
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best series in a long time This is a must watch. Start from the beginning season one you will be hooked
B005D63ICI|5.0|Five episodes in and as addicted as ever. Can't wait to watch the rest and see how the season unfolds.
B00632HWOG|5.0|love the fact that the junk mail goes straight to spam and don't have to open and just delete it. allowing large files to be emailed is great
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched this on Amazon Instant and the service was great and the story was a good continuation from season 2.<br /><br />My wife and I can not wait until season 4.
0399157565|5.0|Have not read yet.  But I have read all of her book except this one and the Scarpetta Factor.  Looking forward to getting into it.
B001UG56ES|1.0|The movie is not good and my playback was terrible. The plot is really patchy with big big holes.visually it looks like a dusty Instagram filter was put over everything
0446580848|5.0|Reading it now.  So far - greatl.  Again, I have read all Nelson DeMille's books.  Wish they would come out closer together!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, it is hard to put down!  I can't wait for the next one.  Vince Flynn tells an amazing story.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I don't have it yet. Loved the series.  Hated for it to end.  Missed the first few seasons.  Then got hooked on it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good Movie. Lot better than the Arnuld version which I never understood because at the end you wonder if it was all a dream or not. Mightve been cool if they did the same thing here - was waiting for it- but they didn't. Good action too. Not the greatest movie or all time btu defn worth renting for $3 if you like action adventure movies.
B00479SVBU|2.0|The signal was strong and it seemed to work alright playing USB files BUT the RDS information transmitting didn't work, I tried in Multiple cars and it would send out the text for a second then it wouldn't transmit the song title anymore. Return was easy, had to pay for shipping.
B004QX07G4|1.0|Bummed! I absolutely adore Ellen and was so anxious to read her book. Admittedly her humor is so spot on you can literally see and hear her in every word. That said the book is pointless. I kept waiting to care about it even slightly but it never happened. I finish nearly every book I read but couldn't find any reason to continue this one.
B005P89F1C|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who is a huge Justin Bieber fan.  Grandmas love to make their granddaughters happy.  What else is there to say?
B005CRQ3RK|3.0|AS :) HAD GGGF GDP REST OF US AND CANADA RIGHT OF US AND UK GOVERNMENT TO DO WITH THE FIRST TIME
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who is a big Adele fan.  She loved the CD and I loved making her happy.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I can't find directions on how to play this game so I don't find it &#34;user friendly&#34; so will not be playing it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Really good storyline, very fast read, I couldn't put it down. Soooo disappointed in the ending, not sure what I was expecting but that wasn't it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I bought this movie for my 6yr old son, as he has the other 3 ice age movies, and let me tell ya this one is as funny as the rest of them......has hidden adult humor in it to keep the parents awake and interested in the movie whilest watching it with the youngins. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is definitely addictive.  I can't wait to see what will be next.  The characters are absolutely great. I have my sister hooked on it now.  Those who havent seen it do not know what they are missing.  Really, its the best TV fare I've seen in ages.  I love the way the show addresses sensitive subjects.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season is just as compelling as the first.  I limited myself to one episode a day, but it was hard.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|The 2011 version of the Footloose, bring a classic to live for a new generation. The production took the oportunity to mix new elements into the movie to try to appeal to the younger generation. MP3 players and cell phones are some of the few elementes introduced with the intent to modernize the story. Besides that, the drama and the main idea still the same as the original. Although with some scenes that brings some currents issues to life (violence against women, overprotective parents, and peer pressure) the movie is good to see as a family together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game! Easy to play and you can progress easily without buying gems if you don't want to. You can also earn gems which is a rare treat in games like these. Very lifelike graphics on both the look and movements of the horses. I am sure I will be playing this game for a long time to come.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|If you have seen this movie, but you have never seen the series, I suggest that you take sometime and watch Firefly series. The movie is a stand alone storyline by itselft, but there are many things in it that would require the knowledge of the series to understand many of the little picklines, sides stories and jokes that go around. I have it always available to watch it every now and then. A good combination and balance of action, drama, space exploration, comedy and justice makes this movie one of my favorite ones. I recommend it!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Liked the first Season way better. Like the movies of the 70s, NOT showing all the gore is scarier. Thanks<br /><br />Mary Brady
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I love this show and there is so much going on that i want to rewatch them to pick up on the things I missed the first time around.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I loved the original trilogy. I only like this follow-up. Renner is good. The story is adequate, but the action in the cities in the first three was better than the action in the wilderness.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Was challenging in a fun way, didn't end quickly and didn't demand more money! I highly recommend.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|He loves it!!  But he has played it so much he is getting bored with it.  Will keep it tho because he does like it so much.  Thanks
0307719219|5.0|It is a very interesting book, however the theory is explained almost only with examples. It is also easy to read and it will shou how the history of economics is related with the theory exposed.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it! Was absolutely crazy and intense. I usually don't like horror but this really was an interesting series. Would definetly recommend seeing it.
B001UAX56A|4.0|I love this album, brings back great memories. One was scratched and another walked away without me knowing. Still remember the snap on nothing really matters.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I've been a fan of Led Zeppelin since about the age of 12.  Seeing this concert and listening to the music demonstrates the talent that the group possessed.  If you consider yourself even a casual fan of Led Zeppelin, you won't go wrong buying this set.  Spoiler:  'No Quarter' is the best performance of the night.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really intuitive and fun to play, this version of Spider is one of my favorites. Nice graphics and simple poke-to-move action (rather than drag and drop) makes for quick and fairly competitive gameplay.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Wow just wow is all I have to say amazing had me on the edge of my seat the whole time great book I would recommend it to anyone

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I am Fred M Jory's wife.  Because he is severely handicapped with Peripheral Neuropathy, and loves to read but is unable to turn pages, his family decided to try a Kindle.  I started by order cowboy stories which he enjoyed in the 30s and 40s.  Then seeing that they were successful, I ordered<br />Phillip Margolin.  They too, were enjoyable.  All of these, including the present Tom Clancy have been so enjoyable for him which is thrilling.  And all of them have been on my account of  Laura Jean Jory , because that was the &#34;order name&#34; under which the Kindle was purchased.  Fred is not mentally able to give you a critique because his speech is sadly affected - but he is obviously enjoying reading and &#34;turning the pages&#34; and I do the rest.<br />I apologize for being so lengthy, but I wanted to let you know why we are using your services as we are.

B007QPFGJW|2.0|A repeat of many characters and themes.  Violence overdone for effect.  I find myself more and more put off by the main character.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Enjoyed this one. Challenging and yet not too difficult. Graphics were well done., which is normal for G5 and can't wait for the next new game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best television series EVER!  From the casting to the writing to the acting...never disappoints!  I can't wait for Sunday evenings...
B001EBWITA|5.0|Although it's a cult film, I really do think that Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role. I really wish that they would make more with him.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this cd..  Its upbeat and makes you want to dance.  I didnt think my son would enjoy it as much as he did either!
1400049628|5.0|Very informative on not only how to survive zombies, but really how to survive anything! If the zombie apocalypse actually happens I will be well prepared!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great music! I love every track!  Cant wait to order more of their cds.  Hopefully they come around to tour here
B007URVZJ6|2.0|This book does a fairly good job of explaining how to go about getting your book ready to publish as an Amazon eBook. However, it also leaves a lot unanswered, such as whether to single-space or double-space, what size margins and typeface to use, whether to use right-justified or justified text, etc. The book also neglects to mention the version of Microsoft Word is used in the examples. Hey, I'm still using my Word 2003, thank you very much, so this book isn't much help. A more specific, nuts-and-bolts approach is needed.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a good game without the popup ads to distract you.  Really do enjoy the different levels of the game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love dis game. I would totally recommend this game for horse lover's. I love this game its so cool.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's almost as thought two novels were joined with a confusing transition in the middle. I must say I enjoyed the two parts individually.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|based on case-studies, the author explains how a solid statistic inference can be developed. It's not about statistics, but rather about the way of thinking statistics.
B007N85POS|5.0|What else is there to say about Angry Birds....this game is addicting just like all the others.  I have a hard time putting my Kindle down every night.  I use the game to unwind after a long hard day!  Please come out with more levels!!!!!
0871404133|4.0|I sometimes found the book hard to read, no background in insects, but very intriguing.<br /><br />I agree with Wilson that modern society does look a lot like an ant hill, division of labor, competition/ cooperation some members self sacrificing, others exploiting/dominating, most individuals dispensible and dwarfed by the whole, world domination, the need for enemies or threats to create mass unity (seems a little self-deluding to call this \\"eusocial\\", eu-anti-social more like it). I also think it may be more than coincidence that both are \\"exoskeletal\\" (ours being the car & other outer casings made of very hard stuff from mines) indicating perhaps we have created an environment as dangerous to us as the world is to tiny insects, also interesting ants and modern humans both seem to spend a lot of their time on busy highways.<br /><br />But Wilson does not seem to realize there are human societies that barely have this, hunters and gatherers have little or none of these things, it would probably be better to say they share the fruits of individual work than cooperate (become tiny cogs in a vast machine) even sexual division of labor is often flexible (eg, the Batek of Malaysia see Anarchic Solidarity. Autonomy, Equality & Fellowship in Southeast Asia\\". Gibson, Sillander 2011).<br /><br />It is also interesting to note that social insects complex division of labour and global dominance is not the result of intelligence or conscious decisions. This raises the question of  whether we modern humans have a global division of labour because we are super-clever (seems to be the unexamined orthodoxy), or because of unconscious processes of cultural selection as much outside of our control or comprehension as the shaping of ant society is to ants. A scary idea, but maybe we should be scared.<br /><br />I also lack his faith in the ability of \\"eusociality\\" in humans to save the world, I'd suggest its great power, lacking any kind of comparable brain, is what's destroying it(this book has made me question 'Peak Oil' analysis (that oil is destroying the planet) now, thanks to this book, I suspect oil's destructiveness is just one symptom of literally mindless \\"eusociality\\").<br /><br />I do like the book very much, it's broadened my view of life & I like Wilson, find his (most famous)critic Dawkins suspiciously & conveniently reinforcing of unexamined social orthodoxy (not saying he's wrong necessarily, just hope so)
B005HED11Y|5.0|I always liked to watch this series when it was first shown on tv.  The space race was young and so wsa I.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game! it is so fun to play and to beat your own records I love the first one but this will make you play for hours
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Enjoyable, predictable reading.  Sparks writing is easy to read with beautiful people as his protagonists and villains.  He needs more substance in his writing.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I dropped my phone in a lake and downloaded kik because  I was bored and wanted to meet new people it's amazingg! Download it asap and if you do kik me:)  I am light skinned (carmel) I have shoulder length brown hair and I'm skinny with largish eyes (not really) my username is jordinleighh
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have seen every episode of this series since it began. I find it very entertaining and am always looking forward to the next episode.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Have enjoyed other books from author. Found this educational and entertaining. Highly recommend. Great points and history throughout the book.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|It's 2012 which would make this album 8 years old to date an as a metal head I'm still headbanging to black hearts still reign,Zombie autopilot everything on this album is pure gold. The great thing about unearth they kept the same brash sound all these years an haven't changed. If you need something that will wake you up an get moving pop in unearth
B0056CUZRA|5.0|THE NOVELS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO HISTORICAL FACTS HAVE A BETTER AND MORE INTERESTING STORY LINE SOME OF THE OTHERS WANDER ABIT
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love, love, love this show and so glad I could order the entire season 4 on Amazon.com.  Had no problem loading the episodes to watch and I loved that I could watch them for anywhere when traveling.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love DA.  It's great fun and I've become hooked on it ... like the rest of the world.  I don't care if it's a glorified soap opera, the characters are so engaging that I feel like I'm right there peeking through the keyhole.
B003CBVU30|5.0|this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. wonderful, kid friendly.  just made me laugh, when i really needed to laugh!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Well thought out product that appears to do a good job of automatically backing up photos from my Android Galaxy Nexus on Verizon.
B000FCK65W|3.0|I like the book but after reading a few chapters I realized I had seen the movie.  I couldn't keep the faces of the actors out of my head.  There were many stories of this nature at this time in history and my own life was reflected in many ways in this book.<br />Susie
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie, with lots of action, and funny one-liners.  I highly recommend. It's not a movie I would normally watch, except that it was recommended.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I wanted to fly to Miami to find out what was the hold up on the next season. It's selfish of me but once you get hooked you never want it to stop. Dexter season 4 just as amazing as all other seasons. Purchase the season, streamline it and enjoy uninterrupted edge of your seat suspense. I would never recommend something I didn't believe in, so don't worry. I have yet to find someone who has watched Dexter, say that they hated it. Never, not once. Horror, suspense, science, forensics, police investigators, murders, gore, all make for a complete exciting package. You will not regret it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to several people.  It had some wonderful &#34;life lessons&#34; learned by an ordinary man, doing something extraordinary.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The best thing, in my humble opinion, is to be able to watch back to back episodes without commercial breaks and having to wait a week to find out what happens next. I like to wait until the season is over and then purchase the season online and watch at my leisure. It's fast, easy and inexpensive. The quality is crisp, and this show will entice all horror movies lovers, such as myself. Enjoy!!!
0345525558|5.0|This book was something new and fresh. I felt so many emotions while reading Victoris's story. I felt sorrow and disappointment towards her and Elizabeth. I wanted to cry for everone especially Grant. I was greatful that the story left me hopeful for all the characters I had grown to love.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Spread the word, purchasing Amazon streamline HD videos is the way to go. No, I don't work for Amazon, I am just a very pleased customer and want everyone to enjoy the benefits. The quality of the picture was crisp, no commercials, just awesome. Now I own the season and I can watch it anytime!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|great documentary. you never know who anyone is online and Nev's experience really shows you how you can be fooled.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I did not have cable for a while and heard a lot of hooplah about The Walking Dead. I discovered I could download the entire season at a very reasonable price (less than the cost of a months worth of cable) and I was hooked. I'd watch one episode...........then had to watch the next...........then would say ok just one more tonight...nope I almost watched an entire season in one sitting. Great show, highly entertaining. Go for it!
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I have enjoyed The Big Band Theory for some time. This just makes it much easier to watch some of my favorite episodes much easier than waiting for a rerun. funny stuff.........
B0028KF4M4|5.0|As long as there is a Dexter season, I will watch and purchase the entire season. Great show, just ask anyone you know who watches it. Again, the benefits of back to back episodes at your fingertips along with the absence of commercials is a movie lovers dream.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I wish it would work on my kindle all the time though. It freezes sometimes. Maybe it is just my kindle. But this is a very good game.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Any questions? You can't go wrong with Dex. The show always keeps me wanting more. My own secret addiction. If you have never watched Dexter, what are you waiting for?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! There's no way you could read 1 & 2 and not read 3. But they're all easy to follow and entertaining.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Melody Gardot's album, \\"The Absence\\" was a lucky jag buy for us while we were touring through France last September-October.  We have both of her other albums and have had the pleasure of seeing her in concert in Australia, so when we heard her \\"La Vie En Rose\\" playing in a French cab early in our trip, I asked in a music store soon after for a recording of that.  Initially disappointed that that hadn't been released on CD, we were offered instead \\"The Absence\\" and in no time it became the theme music of our holiday. Now returned, we have played it at least once every day now for four months.<br /><br />And its magic shows no signs of abating.  I can't think of any other album in my life that has ever stood that sort of relentless playing. There isn't even yet a track I am tempted to skip, either. This is great road music - especially \\"Amalia\\" and \\"Iemanja\\", great cooking music - \\"Mira\\" (love that opening trill!!) , \\"Impossible Love\\" (celli / double-bass yum!), \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"If I tell You I love You\\" particularly, and great quiet evening music (\\"My Heart Won't Have it Any Other Way\\" and \\"So We Meet Again My Heartache\\").<br /><br />And the mixture of bells, street sounds, \\"clicking\\", and other backgrounds simply add an extra depth that transports you to another cultural, geographical, musical space.  Each track sounds like it was produced for a single release, it is so tightly orchestrated and Melody's investment of herself and her emotions in each song draws you in as much as the pureness of her voice and the delightfully chosen musical accompaniments.<br /><br />I'd be interested in hearing other people's interpretations of the backstory to \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\".  To me, it seems Melody is singing the part of a telephone sex-worker, with her \\"so many men on the line\\".  The timing in the delivery of her words in this, plus the teasing and the \\"setting the boundaries\\" language of a practised business woman, and her sultrily spoken \\"Ah oui, je t'aime\\" are the mark of a performer who knows what she's about.<br /><br />The Absence is so different from her first two albums - and that's great!  I'll be lining up for the next one, but this one, it must be said, will be a very very hard act to follow. Brilliant.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|My wife and I were looking for a cute romantic diversion after getting snowed into our house over the weekend and picked this flick after thumbing through the romantic movies section of Amazon's instant streaming service.  I had gotten a glowing recommendation from my brother, who likes things that are a bit more on the independent side of mainstream, so we knew that the movie might be a bit strange.<br /><br />We were not disappointed.  It was strange, and beautiful, and extremely cute, if occasionally disturbing.  Equal parts dark and uplifting, the cast was superb, the camera work was deliberate, well thought out and occasionally brilliant.  The effects budget was obviously small, which resulted in an emphasis on storytelling that I found refreshing.  For better or worse, it seemed more stage than cinema.  My wife's reaction was &#34;That was great but I'm kinda glad I didn't see it in the theater.&#34;<br /><br />I found the story itself addressed a number of deeper issues, from social justice, to depression, to marital strife, responsibility, parenting and small town life.  It addressed these issues seriously, but often using the viewpoint of a child, though I would be aware that some of the themes may require a good deal of explanation to be understood or appropriate for younger children.<br /><br />The movie is definitely worth watching as a primer on finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, both in terms of people and places.  Go and enjoy it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun game to play and easy to use. fun picturees to play and responds very well multiple piece puzzles per picture
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the third book because not only does it have a twisted love story but it capture the true big brother setting and overcoming the issues at hand.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great book. Learned many things I didn't know about Germany and its Air Force during World War II . I think most people<br />would enjoy reading this book. You can't put it down after you start reading, wondering what is happening next.
B005LAII80|5.0|The movie does really well with drawing you into the futuristic world of pain and sorrow.  The visual effects are superb (especially during &#34;Slo-Mo&#34;).  Karl Urban did very well as Judge Dredd.  The overall acting cast was good, not great.<br /><br />But be prepared...it is a very violence and bloody movie.  This is not a friendly superhero movie.<br /><br />The movie was accurate to the comic books and I hope they make a sequel.
1400032717|4.0|I found this book to be very intriguing when you are able to detach yourself from your own mind and put yourself into his. But at the same time I do feel that the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was very repetitive and felt that near the end, the writing styles started to feel like beating a dead horse. But definitely worth the time to read. :)
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was good however pretty slow. Hard to keep focused at times not to walk way. But in the end good story. Great acting!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Addicting and thrilling  and I couldn't stop turning the pages! I can't wait to start the next book and see what happens
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The Blue-Ray format really complements the visual richness of this series.  The extra features are nice to have to get additional info on the characters and locations, and are unobtrusive when moved to the limits of the screen. Great stuff- I'm waiting patiently for my pre-release purchase of season 2.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a great read, making your really think about how we take so many people for granted, epecially our children, with really knowing them!
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|This album is typically great Shinedown music and production values.  None of the songs really stand out like on previous CDs, but it definitely belongs in the collection for any true Shinedown fan
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love having Facebook on my phone! I can easily keep in touch with friends and family, rather I see them frequently or not!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm addicted!!! I can't wait for season 4. There is not a lot of good TV shows any more. I love the storyline, the actors, the castle....everything! I find myself talking with an english accent at times!! LOL!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I was really excited about this mystery game but I don't care for the fact that you are practically shown the answers!
0670026603|4.0|Louisa (Lou) Clark loses the job she's had for years as a waitress at The Buttered Bun tea shop. Worse than losing her job is how much her family needs her income. She's in her twenties and still living at home with her parents, an ailing grandfather, her sister and her nephew. And they all need her to get back to work immediately.<br /><br />In desperation, she accepts a temporary position as a caretaker to a quadriplegic, Will Traynor. Will already has a nurse to care for his medical and physical needs - Lou has been hired to keep him company. Her sole purpose is to spend all day every day trying to make sure he's doing okay emotionally. As she comes to find out, that's a huge job to take on.<br /><br />Will hasn't always been confined to a wheelchair. As a prosperous businessman, he was the one in charge. No matter what he did - from a business deal to extreme sports - Will was always in control. And now he doesn't know how to deal with being confined to a wheelchair and unable to do anything for himself after a devastating accident.<br /><br />His frustration and feeling of helplessness have made him bossy, moody and incredibly rude. Until Lou, no one has dared to challenge him or demand to be treated better. In being real with him, Lou is able to earn his trust and become his friend. Everything is fine until she overhears a secret about Will's plans for his future, which sets a plan in motion to show Will all the joy that can be found in life, despite his limitations.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book was how well the story flowed, as you can probably tell from the fact that I read it in one sitting. Will and Lou's friendship, conversations and adventures are compulsively readable. I eagerly wanted to find out more, see more and read more. I would have thoroughly enjoyed the book even if that was all it was about - the relationship between this man and woman who change each other for the better. They have a camaraderie that just leaps off thepage and makes you care about them as if they were real.<br /><br />I adored the banter between Will and Lou. I loved seeing Will come to life through conversations with Lou, and it was wonderful to see how Lou's horizons were expanded because of meeting him. The tone of their conversations and the wittiness throughout really sold me on the book because it felt authentic and believable. Me Before You was funny, thought-provoking and sad. I thought it was very well-written, and it managed to be heartbreaking without being trite.<br /><br />But there's another huge component to this novel, and it's one that sparks both moral and ethical debates. You may already know from intuition or other reviews, but I won't spell it out here. I will say that regardless of which side you fall on in the debate, this is a book that makes you think. It makes you question. It's controversial without feeling political or heavy-handed. What would I do if...<br /><br />Another thing I loved was that it opened my eyes more to the life of someone in a wheelchair. Reading about the challenges in Will's day-to-day life, and then the added challenge of actually trying to leave the house, made me so much more aware of something I hadn't necessarily thought about before. Even more heartbreaking was reading about he is treated by others. It's definitely a thought-provoking book on many levels.<br /><br />No matter what you think about the controversial topic addressed in Me Before You, I am convinced you'll find the book engrossing and memorable! There's just so much to love about it. We're barely in to 2013, and yet I feel confident in saying that this is absolutely a book that will top the list of favorite reads at the end of the year.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My nephew had this game on Nintendo, I would play it all the time. When I saw it for the Kindle I instantly downloaded it for me!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I enjoyed the story format. The story actually allowed my imagination to believe this was plausible. Great story telling by the author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is almost mindless which is a great way to unwind from a stressful day at work. It is a<br />viable substitute for Ambien!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy reading and also  been read too, this is great way to follow someone else and enjoy alone.
B007REV4T8|2.0|This Bond film was pretty good for much of it, until it turned into a remake of HOME ALONE. The only thing missing were Joe Pecci and Daniel Stern as the villains.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, love it that I can get it on Amazon! I was very pleased with the selection. Not much more to say.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|good diversion I consider it equal to the US masterpiece theater series an enjpy watching the series when time permits
B00009EJC5|2.0|I got this cd because of a certain song but the cd was ok it is what james brown would make
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I watched the original and could'nt get enough.  Found this that restarted the series, was not as good as the original.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Boy i like this show it hooks you right in if your into period  shows the acting is great and customs are great
0141345659|5.0|You couldhve made a little more action in the book.  Overall it was an outstanding book about life.  I would try to get people to read this book because i changed my piont of veiw.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|No words can truly do this Wayne Shorter compilation justice. He and this group just simply continue to evolve in a grand way. This is pure art at its best and most creative. I dont know enough of the technical aspects of music to delve too deeply here but am a lifelong lover of jazz and can appreciate that this is something special. Thoroughly enjoyable. Will be playing this many, many times. There should be a 6 star category for this.<br /><br />Update 2/13. After my third listen I did find the words that may best sum up the brilliance and yes, the passion displayed here and they're right there early on in the midst of \\"Pegasus\\" shortly after Shorter begins a solo, when someone (presumably from the audience) is captured exclaiming \\"Oh my God.\\" There is an almost spritual quality here that puts it on a par with Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\".<br /><br />Update 3/1. After my umpteenth listen now, words that come to mind: inspired, intense, incredibly energetic, perhaps one of the best jazz recordings EVER. All musicians here playing at their finest and blending together spectacularly.<br /><br />Update 4/5. The 2 star review by Michael Quinlan on 4/4 is so off-base as to be almost laughable. This is no sellout. There is nothing here in this music that makes for mass appeal. Far from it! I think its safe to say this group has been on an artistic trajectory over the past decade that has set a new standard for jazz improvisation and their contibution to the art form will prove to be timeless.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  I love Kate Mortons books and have read several of them, however with this one It was just somewhat boring.  It took the entire book to get the whole story of the characters involved while really nothing was happening.  The end was O.K. but again somewhat boring as well, not sure I would recommend this one.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|Fantastic music, I loved the behind the scenes footage, classic and powerful performances by some of the greats - still stands up today.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was one of the best Kate Morton books I have read to date.  It was one of those books that you just can't wait to get back to!  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story with the mystery of how it will end.....it kept me guessing throughout the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season is even better than the first season.  And I love the convenience of streaming in it via Amazon Prime.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, you need to! It is quite possibly one of the funniest shows on right now. Witty and quick, these girls show what it takes to keep up in the fast paced world of the men's shows where it seems the males have dominated with the biting sarcasm and snarky lines. Monday nights at 9 on CBS.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I truly do not understand the 5 star reviews on this one.  I bought it due to the high rating (and low price) and wish I hadn't.  I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to romance novels, but there was nothing remotely romantic (or even good) about Hopeless.<br /><br />I'll start with the main female protagonist, Sky.  I could not figure out how someone could be so utterly stupid.  For the majority of the book, her choices made it seem as though the author was making them to further the plot, not as though they were choices the character herself would make.  The book goes on to say that Sky is supposed to be a smart, well adjusted young woman (as so many other characters point out), but her actions go completely against that line of thought.  As for Holder, I found him to be obsessive and creepy; definitely not someone I could romanticize in my mind.  The whole time I wanted to yell at Sky to just stay away from him.  The other characters seemed to be staples with no real development throughout the story.<br /><br />The writing style is horribly boring and, as someone else's review said, robotic.  It pained me to get through the book, but I stuck with it in hopes that it would get better by the end.  It didn't.  Only more dumb choices and lines that didn't belong.  The characters' reactions to events made them seem like they were much older than 17-19, which would've been ok if they didn't use the language of 13 year olds.  The whole thing seemed disjointed and as though the author didn't really know what she wanted to convey.<br /><br />In the end, I wish I hadn't wasted my time.  I'm putting this review out there in hopes that I can help save the time of a few others who look past the one line, 5 star reviews in order to read this.
B000059GEI|5.0|I received a bad DVD and it was far too late for me to return it by the time I opened it. It had a glitch in the scene where one of the characters walks Monroe to her place and he dances around the water fountain. I thought for a long time that it was my player, and realized when I played it in my computer, it did it there also. Very disappointed.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|What was that ending aboutl. I really dislike movies that dont have an ending... are they expecting us to see PA5... not worth it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a superb show, Sci-Fi or otherwise. Very well written and acted and the Chemistry between all of the main characters clicks very well.  It takes an episode or so to figure out where the series is going, but once you do, you're hooked.  My wife and I could not stop watching the show and in no time at all have almost completed the entire series.  If you haven't watched Fringe, then be sure to give it a try!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids absolutely loved this movie. The story was funny and kept them laughing throughout. I would definitely recommend this movie to all families is was great for all ages.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Once the characters were set and the story lines got moving in typical Dan Brown fashion it Rocked to conclusion.
B0053F3I5Q|5.0|This to date is one of the best albums Ive ever heard ; def one of the craziest ; in my opinion MM's best album ; being their first album too. IT arrived in great condition ; brand new and with a t-shirt . It was like bringing an old shirt back to life . Thanks alot
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game<br />Rele Good if needed to waste time and need it to go by fast it makes you mad but also makes you wanna keep playing lol
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is way better then temple run and u can us it on any device  and I don't know what else to say
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Love the way it changes their voices. This is one they will probably keep forever. The voice can get a little loud and obnoxious after a while.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love being able to get solo many radio stations on my Kindle. I can carry it wherever I go in my hous<br />e and listen to my music.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am thoroughly captivated by this show.  The acting is wonderful as is the portrayal of England during that time period.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Unlike the earlier Stallone film, Dredd wastes little time on flashy costumes.  The film has the dark gritty feel you'd expect from a place like Mega City One, and Karl Urban plays the role of a gritty street judge perfectly.  His helmet almost never comes off, but that doesn't stop him from delivering an excellent performance as Dredd without getting too one-dimensional.  Olivia Thirlby plays his psychic rookie Anderson, on her evaluation day.  And Lena Hedley plays a convincing, if somewhat over the top, gang boss.<br />The film does a good job of explaining Anderson's past, and throughout her first day she has some good character development moments such as her first execution.  CG is good, and the movie starts out with several very graphically violent scenes to remind you that this isn't a fun place to live.<br /><br />Overall this movie is definitely worth your time to watch.  My only complaint is that the story is somewhat self-contained, and it leaves you wanting to see more!
B007UWBQEU|2.0|Carrie's newest album pales in comparison to \\"Play On\\". From the title track \\"Blown Away\\" to \\"Good Girl\\", it seems like she's in a rut. She continues to play music that doesn't suit her personality -- nobody believes she's a man-eater like she portrays in \\"Good Girl\\" and \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\"; these are much more suited for people like Miranda Lambert or Gretchen Wilson. Her best song is \\"Do You Think About Me\\", something sweet and well-recorded that brings out her personality and her incredible vocals. She needs to find her identity in order to get back to her roots and make an album that is more consistent and isn't full of filler songs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awsome great second effort never thought they could improve on a simple yet fun as hell graphics are spot on I do not like however that the objectives are not all available but what can ha do
B005GFPZYK|5.0|That sums up Chris Kyle's life.  With the recent events in Texas it is hard to express my feelings.  Chris was murdered by a man he was trying to help.  What a lose.  His book was excellent and put you on the front lines in the hottest conflicts in Iraq.  Most of the time it was in front of the front lines.  They banter the expression Hero in the newspapers for people that are not.  Chris was.  A must read.  How many tridents were pounded into his coffin?
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I saw this movie and, frankly, I was disappointed. The singing stinks, the camera is too close to the actors' faces, and they cut out 20 minutes of the musical for the movie. What saved this movie for me was Samantha Barks and the fact that they went close to the book in several areas that can't be done during the stage show. For those two reasons I will probably buy it when it's released.<br /><br />Updated 3/27/13:<br />I bought the movie and watched it with my uncle, who loved it. My parents also really liked it. I thought it was better the second time around when I knew what was coming. The acting is very good and the singing is tolerable.
0670026603|4.0|I was enthralled with this story-line from page one -Sure, we know it's a theme that has been done before, i.e., Beauty and the Beast, My Fair Lady, Whose life is it Anyway...but for some reason this was written so beautifully and with so many thought-provoking prose.  The ONLY reason I gave it a 4.5 instead of a 5 was because I felt the author didn't take advantage of the change in narrative voices. We heard from Will's dad, Will's mom, Will's caregiver and then of course our wonderful and endearing protagonist.  Why they didn't give a voice to Will is a curious thing and perhaps would have helped some of the critics better accept the ending. For me, I became so invested in the characters that I couldn't wait to get back to the book every evening.  Of course, I knew what was coming and still cried to the point of hiccups - a rarity for me.  I will recommend this to all my reading friends.  It ever so slightly changed my view of the world and human nature.  Kudos to Jojo Moyes for a stunning piece of writing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great for my needs!  I have not experienced any negative issues. Also like that I can see a history of my recent calculations.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I  feel en reality when I read this author, is permanent entertaining, thrilling and contiuous new situations, it is really good. I am reading for 2nd. time Red Storm rising.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What can you say, if you like Star Trek this is the best way to see it if you don't own your own theater. The picture quality is superb. The extra disc is just more good stuff.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As a Civil War buff and the great great great grandson of William Pitt Fessenden, I found this book to be very well written and certainly felt I had come to know Lincoln better than any other book I have read. I loved the book and even though I knew the ending - I mourned the president as if he was recently assassinated. I also had the unique opportunity to know more of my great great great grandfather.<br /><br />2-11 - 13<br />Conz11@comcast.net
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I enjoyed it very much, who said animation is for children? I really liked the story line and it held my interest all the way until the end. Very good. Thank you very much.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I'm a SA therapist and will buy and show this movie in groups shows the progression of the disease of addiction.
B000002P72|4.0|Excellent recording captures BB in full command.  Good song selection, fine singing and great guitar.  Essential for anyone who likes the blues.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love digital jigsaw puzzles. I am sure I will be buying all the various packs of additional puzzles. As a person who is always early for meetings it is fun to have something like this to fill the waiting time until everybody else shows up.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|mostly a good movie; overdid it on the hallucinations, perhaps, but I guess something was needed to stretch it out . . .
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. I like putting together the puzzle originally but I don't really care for the speed round. It is easily skipped, so I am not forced to play through to get to the next set of puzzles. I tend to get addicted to games like this and play until I exhaust all the fun. I have to put it in the cloud every once in a while and then pick it up a week or two later.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So far I've only played the first five levels.  I've found that the graphics are a great improvement over the original game and enhance my enjoyment.  The game play is smooth and responsive.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the original or who, in general, enjoy physics based games.  My only caution would be for parents.  This game encourages buying power ups so protective options should be engaged to prevent any accedental purchases.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I enjoy this game when I have a minute or two to waste. I find myself playing a game after spending some time reading before I shut my Kindle down for the night.
B0025T65GC|4.0|When I first got into Devin Townsend I was under the impression that all his music was SYL-esque.  So when I picked up Ki I was expecting a brutal assault on my senses.<br /><br />I was not upset to find the tracks on the CD were not \\"metal\\" as we know it.  It's a journey, a soft pitter patter of feet on sand.  Devin's voice becomes an unholy narrator to the sonic travels you will embark on.<br /><br />I love this album, though in a sense of experimenting.  Thus, the 4 stars.  It's a great album nonetheless.  Devin is in prime form.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was hard to read with too many tragic characters. It seemed to meander without much direction and changed who was telling the story so often that it was hard to get a clear picture of an overall theme. I thoroughly enjoyed every Potter book. It's hard to believe this book was written by the same author.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So freaking sad and heartbreakily beautiful. John green always manages to make breathless and impressed. Favorite author for sure. A+
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great story as expected by John Grisham.  Interesting characters with  some twists in the story.  The story is slow at first but becomes fast paced at the end. A quick read.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a rollercoaster ride! Could not put this book down...So many twists and turns. Worth the money! I don't want to give anything away so just buy it already and find out for yourself :)
B008B9JSD2|4.0|An always gentle (yet brave) Italian comedy that has perhaps an added poignancy these days with Pope Benedict XVI's announcement of his resignation, that asks the question: What if the Cardinals held a Conclave and no one wanted the job?  I liked writer/director Morretti's earlier film \\"La Messa `e Finita\\" (\\"The Mass is Ended\\") about a young priest's struggle with staying or leaving the priesthood perhaps even better.  In the earlier film, the reasons why the priest was wondering whether he should leave the priesthood were _none_ of the typical ones discussed here in the United States.  Instead, it was simply: \\"Would anyone really miss me if I was gone?\\"  A similar question underlies Habemus Papam as well even if it plays out on a larger stage.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really fun im really addicted to this game.i love this game so so so much i never want to stop playing.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Excellent teenage film (PG-13 though borders on R) about a shy and somewhat troubled suburban kid entering into high school (his best friend having committed suicide, shooting himself, in 8th grade).  It may become the current generation's Breakfast Club.
B00B99QTM4|4.0|Here's a movie that provides some humor, some romance, and an uplifting message.  I think it would appeal to almost anyone.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|For kids this film is not (definitely an R-rated story). Still, honestly 3 seconds into the film most adults will probably understand why the story deserved to be told.<br /><br />Mark O'Brien was a quadraplegic due to polio, needing an iron lung to breathe, since the age of six.  Despite his disability the opening scene shows news-footage of him, smiling, BEING WHEELED-OUT ON A GURNEY, receiving his master's degree in journalism from the University of California-Berkeley.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about an assignment he gave himself after being asked to write an article about \\"the sex habits of the disabled.\\"  (Again, this film is not for kids).<br /><br />However, Marc O'Brien's own article \\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\\" (Google him and the article) about this adventure is  _definitely_ worth the read and his closing thoughts in that article would honestly impress more than a few Confessors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm not usually much for sequels, but wow, they really stepped up with this one. You earn points a lot faster, and there are a lot more rewards, but you need them because you are no longer running in a straight line. I find the mines to be the most challenging parts.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|Set somewhere in the chaos of 19th Century China of cinematic folklore (brothels, warlords, secret societies, opium dens, still really cool medieval looking armor/weaponry and martial arts tricks, etc) if one can get past the needless gore of this Tarantino wannabe, it makes for a decent enough \\"genre film.\\"  But did it really need all that blood to tell the story?
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Gracias! Genial!!! Muy buena publicación / Guía<br /><br />Pulgares arriba!!!!<br /><br />Buena propuesta para los estudios de la etnografía: Usuario Final.<br /><br />Gracias!!!
B00A8LYYI0|3.0|Based on a Japanese video game with the same name, it's about \\"a sleepy little American town\\" called \\"Silent Hill\\" that's, well, also a \\"Gateway to Hell\\" and the film bounces between this world and the other one. The film MAY take itself more seriously than it should at times (which I did find annoying...), but as a \\"virtual haunted house\\" (err... haunted town) ride it's actually kinda cool. Dante could have enjoyed it ;-)
B007TK77QE|4.0|My only encounter with JK Rowling was a brief attempt to try &#34;Harry Potter&#34; - I couldn't get interested in that. But this was quite different.<br />So many characters and all so very well drawn. Small town politics and the network of families that are linked. A casual Vacancy is created when one of the Parish Councillors drops dead. The two opposing factions within the town recruit candidates to stand to replace him. There are insights into the Medical Centre, Social workers, the school and several of the teenagers who attend, the delicatessen and the lawyers office. It deals with bullying, racism, drug addiction, computer hacking but mostly just general town gossip.<br />There are no murders and no great mystery to solve but it is a jolly good read and a page turner. None of the characters are very nice but we find ourselves sympathising with several of them all the same. I ended up wishing there was another JK Rowling book to read.
B007REV4YI|4.0|A great Bond film, certainly worthy of the 50th anniversary of the release of the first one (Dr. No). Personally, I could have done without some of the \\"back story\\" to Bond's character (Most of us really don't care any \\"struggles\\" he might have had \\"growing-up\\").  However, Javier Bardem played probably the best/creepiest Bond villain in years.  And the film bravely asked about the relevance of a James Bond-like \\"field agent\\" \\"with an exploding pen\\" in the age of hacking and cyber-terrorism.  It's a great question and the film gives the audience a great ride for an answer! ;-)
B00846F1YW|4.0|There is a lot of conversation between characters that I think could be lessened. Good<br />help available and the games were not overly difficult. The graphics are nice and there are<br />lots of them. Good variety.
B000Y0S7VU|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is series that never fails to entice your imagination. The diversity of the Stargate allows an incredible amount of various scenarios, through which SG-1 is able to continuously display their incredible morals. Each member is put through a hard lesson in this season, from Daniel to Teuok, allowing them to show their ability to prevail in a tough situation.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Definitely worth all of the praise. Sandra Bullock was amazing and the rest of the cast was top notch. A good family movie when not many are around anymore.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I saw it at the movies when it first came out . I watched it on TV and I thought they had cut out  a few parts thats why I ordere it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the ui, I used to use catch, this app is a lot more malleable for my needs even considering upgrading!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It was pretty good full of action I like the fact they brought in catwoman and robin.However did not like the way it ended.
B009VB97EY|5.0|The story line was well played out and kept your attention throughout show.  Actors were well cast for their charactors.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Well, I think I've become a fan of Brad Bird. Not only did he direct The Incredibles, but he also did this movie. I really loved the added bits of humor that he threw into the movie. Some might not think it fitting for the MI series, but I really got a great chuckle out of all the characters and failing technology.<br /><br />There were just a lot of moments that were just very fun and cool to watch, definitely a perfect movie for when you just want to have some mindless entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book could not put it down.I love his books. I have been reading his books for a white
B00846REIS|5.0|Didn't think I could find another quite as comparable to 50 shades, but this delivered... pretty dang good !!! Thank you !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really good and enjoyable and amazing. It was a great book. It is a real winner. Go read it
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This has been useful in determining signal strength from my router and additional access point in various rooms of my house.  Also shows what channels my neighbors are using and their signal strengths.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome app.  players gain access to games by earning money.  you get money for beating a game, and when you don't beat a game the points you did earn get turned into money for your game cash.  also, you get rewarded for effort.  I know its corny but it's like the game cares.  rarely does an add pop up.  great great great app.  appropriate for all ages.  :)
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I got the orange one,  but there are other colors available too. What a lovely case, it keeps the screen from being scratched, and it keeps the Kindle Fire safe. It looks like a notebook so it deters people who may want to steal it. It is a nice looking case and it has an auto-on function when you open the case to use the Kindle Fire. The quality is very good, it is well built and does not come apart or break. I recommend this case to anyone who owns a kindle. Marware also makes other cases and this is not their only model. I recommend searching for the models that are right for you. The quality is just right for the price I paid.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game.  I wish it would keep track of points on a running tally.  However, I haven't really read all the settings options.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I have only watched the first 2 episodes, I can't wait to watch more. The show can hold its own and it keeps me engaged. Great show.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Usual excellent PBS historical series.  Compelling characters and beautiful detail.  I watched all of the seasons - it was like a feast.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|This reminds me more of how Star Trek started. The were lost and explored different areas of space. My kids are watching it and they find it fascinating. What a great show, it always has been and continues to be. Janeway is one of my favorites, and the characters are multi faceted. Great show!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Usual excellent PBS historical series.  Compelling characters and beautiful detail.  I watched all of the seasons - it was like a feast.
0425263916|4.0|I enjoyed this book emensly, but it was not as good as the Grey series.  It will definetely get your blood warmed up though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was one of my favorites by Sparks! An ending that was surprising and sob touching. I can't wait to see the movie!
B009G41CG2|4.0|This a a very challanging game, will require alot of thought, but it is fun and enjoyable. I play it regularly.
B00746TURW|4.0|A very sensitive book, perhaps over-philosophical. I enjoyed the part in Saskatchewan but found the leap to adult life a let down.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app several times a day....accurate and easy to use.....not bad for free!!  what more can I say
B009EBLCK8|4.0|This is an excellent show! I highly recommend checking it out. Great characters and intriguing plot lines. Too bad there are only 3 episodes per season!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone I know who watches Downton Abbey gets totally hooked after the first episode. This is hands-down one of the best Masterpiece Theaters shows I've ever seen. If you enjoy British period movies, you will love this mini-series.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Dr. Who is an excellent show and season 5 is no exception!  Every detail is planned and each episode takes you on a different ride through space and time.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game easy to chase onto.....even without instructions or having ever played it before. I am looking forward to playing all the versions
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It is a rearly nice book and I really enjoyed it. It is recamened by me! It is a book for age11+ because there are so rude languages.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I love it because it was gripping, and it explained really deep into the action bits!!! you should really try it!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The free trial ended right as the game was getting really good. Five dollars for the full version. Worth it kind of. Game play was fun. I enjoyed the mini games.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Changes your perspective on life and what you should be doing with it.  Very inspirational if you can open yourself up to that type of thinking.  Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I must say I really like this game.  It is exciting and for any ages.  I would recommend that if you don't have this game you get it.  It's very addicting.
B004HD61KE|3.0|I enjoyed the plot and the way it played out, but it seemed that it was too wordy or something.  It proved to be a slow read for me.<br />I had not read any other Sigma Force novels, so it was hard for me to get my head around the cast of characters.<br />I would recommend that this book be read only after one of the early Sigma Force novels.
B000035Z3K|5.0|This has been my favorite movie for years.  Now I finally purchased a DVD.  Thank you.  I will turn out the lights and watch the movie.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My grandson plays with this a lot.  He likes it but it frustrates him, he's only 5!  A little more information on how to play or &#34;Tips&#34; would be helpful.

B0094K1QR8|5.0|This was an entertaining movie. Did enjoy it. I do recommend it for adults.  It is not recommended for children.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|No words can describe how perfect this book is. Read it in 2 days. GREAT BOOK. It felt like if i was just in that situation. Well done, well done.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Had thought this would be annoying. I give most movies a chance - at least in the beginning, however, and only watched this in it's entirity due to the soundtrack grabbing me early on, especially after hearing Bishop Allen (click click click). I'm glad I gave it a chance, it's pretty funny and Ashton is at his very cutest. Highly recommend. Giving four instead of five stars because I find female lead annoyingly cute. Prefer the working woman digging on Ashtons character, and was secretly rooting for her. She's a more interesting character who is intellectual, creative and basically babysits idiots for a living, far more interesting and relatable than the generic, cutesy cliche successful hospital worker / doctor he wants to be with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Being a college student and a mother, I am always on the run. It's great to have this Bible on the go and it offers many additional features.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Like James bond; always enjoyed the campy bits in previous movies; Daniel craigs productions come across as much more serious action films. As such; I was surprised at the old school approach of a traintop fight complete with tunnels to start the movie. Not much new here in regards to action films.  Repeated references to age of many characters segued into actor changes; but was a little heavy handed.  The finish of the movie was coontrived. Driving to Scotland only worked in the bit of incorporating the gamekeeper and his comments.  I do think the glamour in bond movies helps with the overall effect and this was missing to the extent it usually bouys along bond movies.  Not a miss but not a purchase option.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this  arcade are  my favorite<br />  Its very addicting  and keeps my  mind busy<br /> Will  tell  my friends !
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Just love Christmas music and this is one of the best that I have.  Good selection of songs<br />great arrangements
B000TETC6A|5.0|I was inspired to go back and see what old vinyl LP's I used to have when Bowie released his latest. This is a brilliant classic example of Bowie's artistry. If you only ever bought one of his albums, I'd recommend this one.
B0081336FO|5.0|Best remake of anything I can think of. Really enjoyable. You should start with the first season, but season 2 is even better
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really like this software and I have no complaints about having to pay for something valuable, including adding software for fonts. Like any software of this type, you need to take some time to  learn it, but it allows me to integrate my MS Office 2010 Suite to my Kindle Fire HD. One nice feature was how it linked its files to my DropBox cloud, (along with several other cloud providers), allowing easy file sharing between devices including my main business computer. Like most software of most any type, it could have a better manual through its help app.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Some great ideas and intense moments. I would have liked o get closer to the characters.... i found myself skipping whole sentences to get to the next bit of creative zombie action.... Overall though, a great genre piece...
B001D52XO2|5.0|Quiet, quality music which thrills the soul and relaxes the mind.  Today, we should insert all the discs in your player and just listen and share with a friend.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Really good vocalists, with a silly story for supporting the vocals. Just what you  would expect, except, as I said, the vocalists are excellent and that pleasantly surprised ,me
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love breeding the dragons and playing against my friends.  We try to see who can breed the epic dragons first.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So glad that I lived long enough to see this type of social media and all the technology that I use so much.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 has really hit its stride.  The show's first two seasons were a bit scattered and confused, but Season 3 is television perfection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game isbso addixlcting and I play it as much as i go on the Internet or even more. I am very glad I got the extra double coins feature. That was also worth it.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|WALL-E is the most fun I have had with an animated film in years.  Almost as good as UP.  Amazing how animated robots can have more a realistic romantic relationship than a chick and her vampire beau.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Couldn't even get past the part to find the room keys. Found them all &amp; the gsme re-set. Tried again,  &amp; at the same point in the game, it crashed my phone.  UNINSTALLED immediately.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I am not sure I will be watching next season at this rate.  I found some of the storylines and characters to be engaging, but they tended not to work well together.  I was hoping for a more moody, gothic horror story, but the sci-fi elements seemed really out of place.  I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching it, but it certainly did not have much of a pay-off.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Definitely a good start to this series. It gets you wondering about many things in our universe and leaves you asking many questions about where this series is going.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|My girls really love this film.  I cannot say that it is really my kind of movie, but I don't think that I am really the core audience.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Brilliant varieties of sub-plots immerses one to continually be amazed within the clandestine environment that one is rapidly involved at a rapidly increasing pace. Very easy to read from cover to cover. I would highly recommend this book.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, even though I am often not thrilled about scatalogical humor in many movies. This one has a bit of heart along with the laughs and the raunchy bits.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very well written, and an excellent read. It was an assigned book for a book club I am part of, full of adult women. We loved this book!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I have loved the Bourne series and this one does not disappoint at all. It makes you want to go back and watch the 1st 3 again.  I have some friends who never seen the series but were ready to start the Bourne identity after watching the deleted scenes.  I was a bit taken back by Jeremy Renner as a super spy until I saw him as Hawkeye from the comic book series.  He really does a great job in making you believe he is his charactors!!
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I began watching this series years ago, stopped & then picked it up again streaming on Amazon Prime.  I have always enjoyed medical shows.  I enjoy the interactions/ relationships among the characters in this series.  I LOVE the benefits associated with my Prime account.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. I know the weather where I am going and the weather at home., also at my friends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was randomly chosen for our February girls book club and it was great!  There was a good story here that really spoke to the heart of this HS student falling in love for the first time and learning how to let go and allow herself to love, even though it's not always easy and fun.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Heartwarming hilarious nostalgia that is timeless. Speaks to the need we all have for a small dose of whimsy in our electronic, fast paced, practical and reality based contemporary lives. A less edgy precursor to the movie 'Ted' .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Each book gets better than the last!  This series may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it and had trouble deciding what to read after I was finished this trilogy.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Paul McCartney sings no Beatles songs on this DVD (although there is a nice number he wrote called &#34;Valentine&#34;.) Trust me, the absence of songs by the Fab Four is no problem. Here, Paul sings the &#34;standards&#34;, the pop songs of the 1940s and 50s, mostly, and it's a wonderful experience. Backing him up are Diana Krall and her group, plus Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder and a number of other talented musicians, including a small orchestra. An experienced technical crew and dedicated producers also lend their talents. The program is filmed in black and white and was made in the old Capitol Records buildings in Hollywood. There is a fine intimacy here, with many tight closeups of Paul alternating with close views of the musicans. There are many moments where you really do feel you're a part of the whole process and it's a truly memorable performance. Among the songs are &#34;I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,&#34; &#34;Accentuate the Positive,&#34; &#34;The Glory of Love,&#34; and an especially lovely song called &#34;Home,&#34; and a load of others. In between numbers are commentary by Paul and different musicians and technicians who worked on the program. Even if you're not familiar with the songs on the DVD, you're still likely to enjoy it. I love it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is the book everyone talks about putting down and not going back to.  If you can get through this one the next two are a better read and have more in them then sex.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of the better stories. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the Jack Ryan series.  Jack Jr. is definitely following in his father's footsteps.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read all three books and each got better than the last.  I could really relate to some of the emotions, frustrations and tenderness written in this story.  Some sexual details are hard to read but you can get through them and keep the story in the fore front.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I was invited to take the Whole 30 Challenge and ordered the book, which is the life style change that one can follow both during and after the challenge.  The book is well written and contains excellent information.  I am now three weeks into the challenge and am sleeping and feeling better.
1583334386|5.0|What do you want to improve in your life? Improving your self-control will likely help. Maybe you want to save money or lose weight (checkout [[ASIN:0345526880 Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think]]). Kelly has many tips to help. Even better, she has excellent case studies and explains the why behind our actions. I found this book more enjoyable and practical than [[ASIN:0143122231 Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength]].
B008JJM88Q|3.0|it's ok... works fine and all but gets on my nervs really quick... dont know why it just does. It also gets old really fast.<br /><br />It's good for showing it to someone that does not know how it works!
B0002X1JKU|3.0|Warren Buffett says The Intelligent Investor is \\"by far the best book on investing ever written\\". That's reason enough to read it.<br /><br />With classics, the real value comes from reading the original (which was from 1949). This revision already feels dated.<br /><br />This book didn't change my life but may impact yours. You may get more investment insights and satisfaction from Warren's biography, [[ASIN:0553384619 The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life]].
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Numerous plots within plots make this an interesting and provocative story. Tom Clancy is at his best with another Jack Ryan novel. I can't wait for the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's pretty fun but don't recommend to people who don't like temple run. I play it day and night. Never stop!
B00APUYN0I|2.0|This movie couldn't decide if it was earnest or ironic. The script and characters were flat. Pales in comparison to other female centric comedies like bridesmaids, which we watched right after to get the bad taste out of our mouths.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moWKQFY78MWROD]]I have done a video review of three of these Belkin Cases being tried on three different tablets.  The Blackberry Playbook which is the same dimensions as the Kindle Fire Original.  The Nook HD, and the iPad Mini.  I also explain the ports, the feel of the case and a few other things.  If you have any questions I did not answer in the video,  feel free to ask me in the comment section below.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|The kids picked this out for a Friday night at home movie.  Very cute.<br />Don't know if I'd spend full movie amount though at a theater.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Greta great book! I can't wait for the next book to come out and see how the lives of the characters lives Finnish out
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|So substitute &#34;witty&#34; for &#34;funny,&#34; and it's a bit more accurate. But the first three quarters of the way through this book was a pure delight of teenage angst and wit. There are great literary references, a bit of a surprise with the revered fictional author, and an honest perspective of a teenage girl that just happens to have an oxygen tank, cancer, and the guilt of not outliving her parents. Sure, the sex between the two teenagers is unbelievable, the ending is completely expected and almost drowns out the wit that came before, but I knew it had to be there. It is, after all, a book about teenagers dying of cancer. It is also completely worth it to read the wit and honesty.<br />To say this book surprised me is honest. To say the ending disappointed me is true. To say that I like it anyway may still be relevant.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Over all good watch. Stop few times but that could be from any thing. Had not see the old star trek in some time and not back to back like this with them having 3y of the star trek
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Honestly, the reviews comparing this to Catcher in the Rye were probably the reason I decided to read this in the first place; although, honestly, I never liked Holden Caufield. This book is about a boy who is less a wallflower and more a doormat. He chooses to allow himself to be hauled along by whatever his friends want, and never makes any decisions himself. True, the ending of the book is the reason as to why he is this way, but at no point does anyone ever wonder why. It trivializes the &#60;spoiler alert!!&#62; abuse he suffers at the hand of a relative. Even the drugs he does is never intended to self-medicate. Instead, they are just because his friends are doing them. Even his making out with his male friend is based never on his own sexuality, but simply because his friend is lonely and hurting and probably, I don't know, needs to make out.<br />At no point does he understand, even when he is told by a friend, that he needs to make decisions based on what he wants or needs. Overall, there are some humorous parts, some very &#34;real&#34; moments, but they are surrounded by a jellyfish character that makes decisions by not making any decisions.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Man, what a book. This book is simply fantastic. That's the only word I can think of for it. I'm deeply saddened for the loss of Chris a few days ago but I know he's in a better place. Probably in the backroom as he states in the end of his book lol. I would recommend this book to anyone who truly wants a glimpse inside of war and inside the life of a SEAL and a hero. Just an amazing book about an amazing person. Rest good Chris you've earned it brother.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|versitile and practical, well designed to circumvent rolling over and ignoring the alarm.  lots of choices for the alarm sounds.

B000FC146C|4.0|The Thorn Birds is a frustrating story for the modern world, being female myself it's just hard to get inside the mind of a woman of this era!  But then it brought back stories from my own mother who grew up in the 'dust bowl' and un-ruffle my feathers.  This is a wonderful well written story of family, love, relationships and difficult times.  I hope this book is a literary requirement for every high school, because every one should read it!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Maybe I'm getting old, but I just want to see sci-fi without blood and gore and sex and political aganda's and this fits the bill perfectly.  If you just want sci-fi, with an interesting story line (not sure how we humans will ever be able to come back from the brink) and good special affects, then check this series out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book!  It is so imaginative but also so believable that three quarters of the way through the story I had to check to see if it was based on true events.....Get ready for an adventure!
030758836X|5.0|There's not much I can comment without potentially giving something away.  Let's just say that for me, it lived up to the hype.  It was a slow start for me in the beginning; I wasn't thoroughly engaged until about 100 pages in.  After that, I couldn't put the book down.  I dare not use any more adjectives because anything I say may ruin your experience.  You're just going to have to read it and see.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Once again Rick Riordan has woven a fantastic story of Percy Jackson's adventures. This story ends on a cliff hanger that leaves you grasping for more. I can hardly wait for the next installation of this awesome tale.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Loved it Loved it Loved it
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Have always enjoyed this period of history and the story of the Tudors is written so well, made so believable.<br />The actors are fantastic in their roles.  Costumes, sets, scenery, all fantastic.<br />And the focus on the eyes of the actors is amazing...as if you can see into their souls.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard about Downton Abbey from so many friends, decided I'd better check it out. I was going to have to pay $2 per episode to watch it on Comcast On-Demand, so was very happy to find I could watch the first and second seasons for free with my Amazon Prime membership.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I really enjoy this series. Anyone who is a fan of X-files or Stargate or even Star Trek's Mirror Universe will love the ideas presented in this series. It's a very entertaining ride and I can not recommend it high enough.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very useful app! Not only does it tell you how much battery life you have left, it also gives you an estimate (given your current battery level) of how much time you'd have available to use various modes (i.e. Video Playback, recording, reading, playing games etc.) I absolutely love this app!
0307592731|3.0|I must not understand what piques a publisher's interest. This isn't a book about hiking or the PCT. This isn't a book about redemption or self-discovery. It's not a memoir of someone who has affected our lives. Not good fiction. It's not a self-help book. It's really nothing more than something I'd expect to hear from a maudlin acquaintance who has had a bit too much to drink and who has lost their \\"too-much-information\\" governor.<br /><br />The author is a train wreck, and chooses to perseverate on her issues throughout the book...which really aren't all that remarkable or interesting. She enjoys dropping salacious tidbits in the middle of otherwise serious topics. (Dear Lord, did we really need to know about how the nurse's penis looked in his pants while your mom was dying? Why? Why!?) She seems a bit maniacal as she discusses shooting her mother's horse in the head (repeatedly), and describing its lingering death throes. (Again, why!? Why!? How did any of that add to the story?) She describes her s***, handling her menstrual sponge, and other cringe-worthy topics. And none of it adds to the story. The author isn't nearly as interesting at the PCT, which I didn't learn one significant thing about in the entire book. Sure didn't make me feel like heading out on the trail, which is what I believe most people look for when they open a book that appears to be about...hiking! I'm not even sure she ever \\"found\\" herself, either. Maybe she grew up, but most grown-ups don't still feel the need to pick at their scabs in a public fashion in order to prove they are now okay.<br /><br />I came to the conclusion somewhere in the middle of the book that the author might be of a head case who really, really wants people to talk about her. And it seems to have worked. Golly-gee, even Oprah picked her up for her book club. But anyone who knows about Oprah's track record with book choices would take that kind of recommendation with a million grains of salt.<br /><br />So, why did I give this book 2 stars? Because I found what I felt to be one honest, perceptive statement in the book, written about Crater Lake. I won't cite it here.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this book? No. I don't see much in the way of socially redeeming value in it, much less entertainment. Do I see what others find so fascinating about it? Yes, but I also think that speaks to what appeals to the masses these days, which is a sad statement about our society.?

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Like the rest of you I was rolling my eyes at a serious version of judge dredd. After growing up with the Sylvester Stallone version I didn't think it could be done. But I as so wrong they managed to make a better movie that was more serious and treated you more like an adult. I hope to see a sequel in the near future.
B0060AY85C|3.0|Beautifully written but the storyline is somewhat boring.  Lacks the grab of her previous work.  Great characters,  unfortunately you spend the entire time waiting for them to arrive.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I heard about this shoe from a youtube reviewer so I decided to check it out. From the pilot to the finale once I started watching I couldn't stop this take on the Victorian character in a modern setting is absolutely wonderful.
030758836X|2.0|...but it really wasn't.  This book had potential, there were many twists and turns that keep the readers interest.  However, the author must have been in a hurry at the end because the story had a weak ending.  Not great.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Apparently people didn't like this ending which I can kind of see, but on the other hand it fits in my mind. It's and ending that let's you create your own version of how the main character lives out the rest of his life. Normally I hate these kind of endings but for this show it works. It didn't tie up every loose end which did annoy me but it was still better than other final seasons I've seen.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Everything I expected. Good voice, alot of hits to move to my iPod, cheaper then buying each song off iTunes
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game gets kinds laggy after a certain point. Sometimes that game wont even start. other then that the game is the best game created for kindle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have really enjoyed Downton Abbey that I tell everyone about it if they haven't already heard of it.  I would recommend it to everyone.  The acting and the characters are remarkable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This my favourite game ever I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys fun Best game ever ........ ,,,,,, .......
B004DM0UII|5.0|Fantastic quality and great selection. This is a must have for radio enthusiasts. Comparable to other Internet radio apps like iheartradio.
B001KWTBVQ|3.0|Another version of a Cinderella story.  I enjoyed this one because I am a big fan of Drew Barrymore.  I liked this one because it showed how close she was to the other &#34;servants&#34; and the lengths to which she would go for them.  Anjelica Huston makes a perfect wicked stepmother.
0439023513|5.0|This is one book you cannot put down.  Enjoyed it from the first page to the last.<br />Yes, buy this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|What a great story.  It is hard to put down, once you begin reading it.  The characters are intriguing.  I will be reading  more books from this author.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|This woman is a very interesting person but this movie did not do her justice.  Merle Streep as always is one fantastic actor.<br />But I would not recommend this movie if asked.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins does a great service to all managers in sharing his quantitative analysis on what makes companies great.  This is a must read for any executive.  Leadership is a key to greatness and Collins walks the reader through all the components of a great company very methodically.  My favorite business management book of all time.
0307454568|5.0|Love the supense and story.  It is one that when you start, you can't seem to put it down.  Buy it.
B008745B32|2.0|I did not need to get far into this book to realize this was definitely NOT my reading genre.  I do not enjoy reading about War or Post War eras.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I love musical's.  The music is great and the story is cute.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes musicals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is rellay thrilling especially.when you add it to facenook and you can have a compaction with your friend to see who has the highest score
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works good adds correctly, no problems so far easy to use. User friendly app that is good for beginners. Facebook
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a fun game to play it has many improvements that the first one but the second one needs more charictors.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids all love this game! Lots of giggle time to occupy them when have to set and wait. This is their fave!
B001BANK32|5.0|Fantastic! I cant believe i waited so long to finally read it!!! Remake that horrible first movie and get it right!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a wonderful book it keep into the story.  If you are looking for a good book it is one.
B008Q08EV8|2.0|Couldn't get into this movie at all. Maybe another day I will try again. I typically love these types of movies I just can't put my finger on what was missing
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Good game but I would say my opinion is I like the first one better cuz this one is waaay harder. A few newer rules
B008PV5G2S|5.0|Loved it all the way around! Has a great lesson and story line. Actors played parts well.  my kind of flick! Loved it, loved it, loved it!
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Okay, I love this game but there are things that need improvement. After a while the pets, houses, and fun houses become expensive. I don't want to spend real money on a virtual pet. Which you would lose if you switched to a new phone or tablet. (This has happened to me) Gameloft, please stop making all of the good stuff cost gems, and SO many gems at that! Also, sometimes when I visit a friend's town, the whole thing is black and I can't see houses or pets.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is a great app. Since I have started playing I have gotten my friends and family playing. The game designers are constantly creating new dragons so the game never gets old. You are able to visit your friend's land and see what they are doing plus give game gems to others to help them improve their land.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love being on FB and now on my kindle fire hd even better can't get enough going to enjoy this a whole lot
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Less than 10 hours after downloading this app it crashed twice and restarted my game back to level 1. This app isn't worth the free download until the bugs are worked out.
B004EF8ARM|5.0|This wonderful British \\"lit\\" film was well-acted well-written and beautifully filmed. So glad that I decided to spend the time and view it - I'm a Jane Austen fan, and this was definitely as romantic and touching as any of her novels!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Used to run fine on my G2X, but now crashes before the game even starts on my Galaxy S3.  Fix please!
B00406TRU4|5.0|Great not to have to hear vulgarity or see expicit sex scenes. The acting is great and the action is riveting. Love the show!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|cant find my printer on the list and can't find anywhere to put it manually.  says printer test page, but don;t know where,
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful series!  My only complaint is that I wish there were more episodes per season, which isn't really a complaint, as much as a testament to how much I enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A friend suggested I read it.  It is fast reading.  It is a bit gruesome at times.  The hunger games was pretty much science fiction.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|pure 80's goodness. The real thing- not a pseudo interpretation of what the music sounded like three decades ago. Seriously.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I used it to catch up since I missed the first few episodes.  Plus one DVD has special features with more info about the castle.  Stunning cimema.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Is the best weather apt i found. Simple to use and accurate!! I have tried almost all the other weather aps that at least all with three or moore stars and AccuWeather is my fav.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I LOATH games that urge you to post your achievements to facebook and other social media.  Make it a subtle option not a friggin' road block.  Even when given a chance to opt  out (which this game does in an almost imperceptible way) I still hate it.  When a game is designed like this I don't even give it a chance it gets deleted immediately.  Although, If the publisher were willing to pay me to make ridiculous marketing posts on my wall I might be interested.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good, fun game with cool characters and graphics, very very very enjoyable. I think it's really fun and keeps you occupied for a while.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|When I ordered this DVD, it was like 19$.<br />Now it's 10$.<br />What is going on?<br />The price shouldn't change that much!<br />I guarantee that it will go up soon again. Grab one when it's 10$.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie was hilarious and I don't feel regret purchasing it in 19$.<br />I bought it in DVD because the Bluray price was a bit high.<br />They only reduced the DVD price.<br />Hope the Bluray was closer to 20$.
B009CPES4I|5.0|The scenery is marvelous, I feel like I've been to India and never left my seat.  This is a great story of new beginnings.  Highly recommend for the over 50 audience who will really appreciate it.  I love Maggie Smith, she's my favorite actress and she's great in this movie.
B007I1TFK0|3.0|I like all kinds of musicals.<br />But not this one.<br />I forgot that and bought the Bluday.<br />The reason I hated this one is because<br />1. Madonna doesn't fit the roll since she was already too old at that time.<br />2. Antonio's commentary like singing bothered me a lot.<br /><br />Also I prefer music + dialogue better than all music musical.<br /><br />The picture is perfect. It's pure HD.<br />The sound is HD too and seems very well transfered. But not well divided into 5 channel.<br /><br />If you like this mobie, get the bluray.<br />If not, don't make a mistake like me.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|This is a good story and would recommend this for the over 50 croud who can appreciate arriving at this part of life.  It's great to see how ordinary people can build a new extraordinary relationship!  Loved the scenery.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Use it on my Kindle Fire and it's so easy and convenient. Have tried others and this is the best!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved this season and just when I thought all was well and we'd get on the the new building of Downton.......  I can't wait for Season 4!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a beautiful book. It's suspenseful yet romantic and everything in between! I loved it!! I hope everyone reads it
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Very interesting.  I'm not hooked like with Downton Abbey,  Could do without so much nudity and sex.  Don't see where it belongs quite so much,  I love Mandy P and glad to see him back in a series.
3836532441|5.0|This book is great for the coffee table.  Guys and girls alike will flip through the book when they sit on your sofa.  Its a great conversation piece and well put together.  Awesome price for a hard cover from Taschen.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I thought there would be more action flying a damaged plane. It is a sad story and hard to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. Kids love it to. A lot cheaper than owning your own but the joy of watching and interacting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I did an &#34;all nighter&#34; with this one,  8 at night to 4 in the morning,  Just couldn't stop watching to see what happened next!  This story is so interesting.
B007HO392S|5.0|We all love Carrie Underwood at our house and this CD is awesome!  We were very pleased with it and recommend it to other people too!
B008M36EEI|5.0|I love movies with happy endings!!  If you love Downton Abbey you'll love this.  Beautiful scenery, I felt like I was there.
0765325950|3.0|The book was good.  It's a shame to need to buy the book because the kindle version doesn't come out until March.  I guess it's all about money.
B003YTLKTE|2.0|This is not my type of movie.  I would say this is for a younger audience and people who enjoy this type of music.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|This was such a great read. I didn't want to put it down. Not your typical love story. It would be a great book club book.
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|this version of Jane Eyre was mediocre.  I found the acting okay with the woman playing Jane dull playing her role.
B004WKI204|3.0|I still cannot get my head around this book. Not what I expected at all. I felt most of the stories were over exaggerated, and the order in which the stories where written was very odd. I regret not getting the audio version.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Return to Cranford continued to be superb.  The acting was enjoyable as well as the story line.  I loved the setting and costumes.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Loved it!<br />Couldn't put the book down at the end, as I wanted to see when and how Pi was going to be rescued.<br />What a twist to the story!
0739366408|5.0|Listening to all of the different readers made this book very enjoyable. If you love Zombies and have a long ride in to work this is worth the money.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love this show.. Mark Harmon is absolutely the best.. Without him there would be no NCIS...I have all seasons on DVD and watch them over and over..
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm no snob but the writing in this book combined with the stupidity of the main character made it almost impossible to finish
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have always been into military style games, but this, this is FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!!!! I love being able to make allies and train your army to attack others, not to mention the campaign
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Makes you think. If you like a challenge  you will like this game. Give it a try. It is a lot of fun.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|This has been his best album by far. I'm not a very huge fan but believe and believe acoustic are way better compared to his other albums . He's a talented guy and very generous ! He should keep doing what he's doing and \\" Believe \\" . (;
B00B19DMUE|1.0|I really did not like it that much. It was just, ok.  The acting was decent and the effects were alright but that is about it.
B008KRBTU0|5.0|my son is 4yo and finds this game enjoyable as he is learning new words.  i take it with us to restaurants and on car trips.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|The kindle fits nicely in the case and makes traveling with the unit nice.  I wish it had a place to store the pen.
B00846F1YW|4.0|loved it.<br />wonderful and clear items with a little bit of puzzle solving. keep updating .tomake even more challenging. great
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I couldn't believe how easy it was to set up a e-book.  I have written several unpublished books and had no idea how to get them published.  I will be uploading the first three this month.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I felt even though there were twists and turns, that it was just too easy and predicatble.  Just didn't ring true for me.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Loved this book, love Nicholas Sparks. Definetly worth buying because you will want to read it again and again. :-)
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I bought this for my mom as the stylus I gave her for Christmas was too narrow and the tip was too flat. She really liked this one from Cosmonaut. The only gripe she had is that there is no mechanism to attach the stylus to anything while not in use. A clip on the end or a chain of some sort with a large lobster claw or key ring would be helpful.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|nice classic to read, the story of course is an old one but well portrayed in this book<br />rate it highly
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|This CD is awesome, great original blues.<br />DVD selection of songs from the CD are the best.<br />Would recommed this CD and DVD to all blues lovers.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I have every garbage album and this is my favorite. Catchy tunes and great lyrics make this recording excellent. Rock, pop, beautiful ballads and dance songs grace every inch of this great album. If you dont have any Garbage in your collection this is the one to get! Shirley's attitude really comes across here, she is a true rocker, not a wanna be. Big bright world is my favorite:)
B00008BLAS|2.0|I've been gradually replacing all of my older CDs with digital remasters, so when I purchased this Grand Funk CD, I thought I was going to get one that was whisper quiet when it was supposed to be in a song and between songs.  Yea...right!  If this CD is what Capitol records is trying to pawn off on the customer as a \\"remaster\\", then these clowns need to learn what \\"digitize\\" actually means when reissuing a studio album.  I'm sitting here listening to this CD and I'm EXTREMELY disappointed at the quailty of sound.  If I had known I was going to get a professed \\"digital remaster\\" of such obvious poor quality, I wouldn't have wasted my time, effort or money searching for and purchasing it in the first place.  Hopefully, Capitol will step up its game and begin offering true digital remasters in their catalog in the future.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I didn't like this game too much. I don't like the way it does not give you time to play your game, by the time you look like you're about to get bingo the game is over and other players win. who are the other players, by the way
B00296A4F4|5.0|I will eventually buy the season. I loved it that much. My boys and I could not get enough of the show.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas tag on my Father in laws present, he really got a kick out of, It does work and the light shines pretty good for it being small. the legs fold in for easier storage.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Though it was my intention to stop after completing the first book of the trilogy ... I was encouraged by a colleague to at least read the second to obtain answers to some of the questions unresolved in the first. I was not disappointed. The author masterfully provides quite plausible hints and clues as to why Christian's personality has evolved as it has without becoming maudlin in the process or painting Christian as a victim. Anastasia is the classic \\"innocent\\" caught up in the gravitaional pull of an irresistible force. All of this notwithstanding - for me - both remain caracatures. I identify with neither and don't particularly care what happens to either of them. Given this, I am a bit surprised at my compulsion to complete the work.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I am  very very very happy with this and i recommened this to anyone who like this type of thing.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|If you love Halo and the story surrounding it, this is a Must Watch. I know you can get this on YouTube, but in 1080p its so much better.<br /><br />This is what District 9 was supposed to be. (Well kind of, not really)
B000000I3O|5.0|I am  very very very happy with this and i recommened this to anyone who like this type of thing.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon wrote this novel to show the love and bravery of main character Christopher. He is an autistic child that has a love for mysteries and puzzles. Christopher discovers his neighbors dog dead in the yard with a pitchfork stuck in him. Christopher's father tells him that he not allowed to find out what really happened to the dog. Christopher finally gets fed up with everything that his father has put on his plate and decides to go on a journey that will change his life forever. I give this book a two thumbs up. This was an excellent example of love and bravery in a novel.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The quality was great.  You felt like you were at the Broadway play but in the convenience of your home or car.
0316056898|3.0|First, let me say that I am an admirer of Tina Fey and consider her work for television to be demonstrably intelligent and palpably funny, both rare and refreshing for that medium.  The book is a different matter, especially if you are male, like me, because this book is not written for you.  You might enjoy it but IT IS NOT WRITTEN FOR YOU.  A good chunk of the book is written about things a male cannot possibly relate to.  It's not a bad book, though the style meanders around a bit from purely informative to very funny.  Tina's characteristic sarcastic humor sometimes leaves the reader wondering if you just read fact or funny.  Also, Tina regularly uses profanity in this book, which much surprised me.  What's the need?  Is she deliberately wanting to communicate her \\"earthiness\\" because she's afraid we all think she's a lightweight?  And I hoped the book would contain lots of delicious tidbits about her time in The Second City, SNL and 30 Rock but there isn't much of that.  I kinda sorta felt like I knew Tina Fey via her Liz Lemon character, SNL Weekend Update work, and her stints on various talk shows, and I never, despite hearing rumors to the contrary, felt that Tina was a Feminist with an ax to grind. - she's done plenty of glamor photo shoots.  Well, this book convinced me I don't know Tina Fey. Long story short, I recommend this book to women - there are plenty of comments on menstruation, motherhood and how unfair the world is to women. To a man only if you are a hard core, die hard, a few episodes away from stalking, Tina Fey fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes, there's the occasional ad. They don't interrupt play, just click through them. The game plays smoothly and it has simple, but great little options, you can even play against another player using the same app. The auto finish even has a bit of flash. Totally worth downloading!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|i was late finding out just how GOOD this series was/is. Watching it now i was crying tears of joys at how very excellent it all comes together. If only real high schools had glee clubs like this one
1616550414|5.0|It was what I expected, have so many details fo the world, the chronology is great.  I an not finished with it.
1400032717|5.0|So this was a very swell book I usually don't like mysteries but this one caught my attention, Christopher and I are similar we both are ADHD and get easily distracted I liked how he would be talking about one thing then switch to a completely different topic some people didn't like it but I thought it was cool I would deff intake recommend others to read it.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Just ok. I should have gone to Red Box and paid $1.50. It was not as good as some other choices that are out right now.
0385474547|5.0|It came in the mail within the days it was suppose too; it was in good condition. I felt like it was worth what i paid for it so i consider to anyone that purchases products off of here to trust it as long as they pick one that is suitable for them.
0316224588|5.0|This was vintage Rebus, and it was a pleasure to welcome him back, even as a retired officer, along with his criminal \\"friend\\" Cafferty and good old Siobhan.  The story concerns the disappearance of several women over a ten year period, and Rebus' involvement in the \\"cold case\\" unit of the station.  The story evolves slowly, as Rebus has difficulty convincing the higher-ups that there is a connection between  the different disappearances.  The story takes place all over northern Scotland, and this is one of those books where a simple line drawing map of the area west and north of Edinburgh would have been very helpful in following the narrative.  I found Google maps useful in getting an idea of what was happening, and where.  A couple of criticisms might be noted.  We learned that  within twenty-four hours of the authorities finding some long buried bodies that their DNA matched that of their probable parents.  Twentyfour hours for a conclusive DNA test?  Hmm.  And the conclusion comes a little too easily with the helpful confession of the fellow Rebus had suspected for a long time was the murderer.  Still and all, great Rebus reading, so thanks to Mr. Rankin for giving him to us again.  And, the ending makes it look possible that Rebus may be joining the force again.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|Pochahantas meets Dances with Wolves - one of the more boring movies I have ever seen.  What a waste.  I felt I was watching a futuristic version of Dances with Wolves.
1400032717|4.0|This book is a great read. The first person view of a kid who deals with what seems to be a social disability gives you wonderful insight to the mind of Christopher. The off-track rants of math and science truly show Christopher's thought process in vivid detail. The book has a detailed, real, and uncensored story and is a must-read!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|wasn't bored by this movie like I am with so many others lately. Classic Denzel, I would definitely recommend this movie...but maybe not if you're planning an upcoming flight like I am. Not feeling to great about that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't generally get hooked on shows but this one hooked me from the 1st episode. I immediately wanted to watch all 3 seasons! There are so many different plots going on, you're sure to find at least one you are interested in. It is mostly clean entertainment. There is hardly any sex, violence or bad language yet it still manages to entertain. Imagine that! (Sarcasm)
B009MO5960|3.0|In a nutshell, this movie fits well with the rest of the series, though it's one of the weaker ones. The first and third stand out in my mind, this one doesn't. The plot is convoluted and had potential but, as with the rest of the series, it wasn't fleshed out. The director instead decided to devote most of the time to action sequences, some of which are nice.<br /><br />It's not terrible like the Silent Hill sequel, so I was mildly entertained while watching it. Rent it or get it from the bargain bin.<br /><br />As a sidenote, people seem to forget that the games this series is based on also had terrible, convoluted plots and poor acting. The movies are much closer to the games than our nostalgia will let us admit.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book is great reminder that you don’t need a lot of stuff to in your life to be happy. There are sever great tips that past generations would have considered common sense but new generations may find hard to do given out addiction to things.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I appreciate a free book. This is a classic so I downloaded it for my kindle ap on my Ipad
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!  Ended up reading it the entire 5 hour flight home from my latest traveling adventure, then came home and didn't put it down until I finished it that night.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it, may be my favorite Sparks book and can't wait to see the movie.  I loved the unique ending .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful way to spend time enjoying the look and basic historic framework of the society of that age.  The way the actors embrace their characters just breathes more life into the series as a whole.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Very good book with an intricate weave of characters and fantastic story line. Easily piques your interest.  Not bogged down with overly done explanations of nonessential background.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|While struggling to find time to read this english version, I've been through the Gujarati language version of this novel earlier and reading this novel even partly from the beginning again - has been a good motivational experience.<br /><br />All stars to Victor Hugo and a big thank you to Amazon.com for making this available!
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now gave me a whole new perspective on my life and life in general. It has been a tremendous help in reducing my anxiety and stressors. It will be taking up permanent residence in my bookcase to refer to over and over again. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Now starting on Practicing the Power of Now, which my husband tells me I will appreciate even more.  Looking forward to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved Minecraft on the computer, so I got it on the Kindle. Don't just buy some knockoff to save money, I learner that the hard way.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A beautiful story with an unexpected ending, throughly enjoyable read. Certainly left me thinking about how life can take different paths
1575666286|5.0|I bought this for my mother who has cancer.<br /><br />This is a powerful film that documents the underlying reasons why the medical establishment  pushes drugs, chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of cancer and not only dismisses alternative healing but the medical insurance companies won't even cover alternative therapy. The reason? There's no MONEY in treatments that actually eradicate disease!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love it . It is so good.  If you have not tried this game you really should try the game.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I liked Bruno Mars, his music was great in my mind, enough to buy an album? I wasn't so sure, then I saw him on the 2012 Grammys, I needed the album after that. It was better than I asked for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game ever, its amazing and I love the fact its free. I got a different horse app and this one not only cost less its a lot better.
B00136JQMI|5.0|the album holds up. Released in 1959, I could still listen to it all day long. Simple, yet complex as hell.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is awesome and I knew that I would love it.It's more clear than on a phone screen.and it still has all the same details.That's why I gave it a five star rate.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book flowed so beautifully.  Not a sappy love story, but great story of real love.  Never slow and the read was wonderful
B006LR0XLM|5.0|On my iPad.  Didn't work for me on my Kindle so I took the Kindle back.  But I still have dropbox!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The first scene has sex drugs and alcohol. At times the film is slow and lost my attention. I did like that he finally admitted the truth and welcomed the consiquences.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Watch this movie with children. The will along with adults believe in Santa. What a great Christmas movie. Great Blu-Ray edition.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The fact that this device show the numbers that were entered along with the total is very helpful. Especially when doing long lists of numbers.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I don't usually like theis games but it was the free app of the day so I decided to try it and to my surprize I liked it. A lot more intuitive then other apps of this genre. Nice and solid no bug gameplay. But I do want to suggest a bigger X where u can post your trophys online because it took me a long time to find it. Thanks
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is a very useful app. It helps me know how long my batteries will last doing certain activities. I absolutely give it a 5 out of 5
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is amazing. It is very reminiscent of Braid, and quite similar in a lot of respects. The biggest difference is that in this game, you control the environment to guide the player instead of guiding the player himself. Very well thought out gameplay is only slightly marred by its steep learning curve. The first level would have you believing this game is too easy to bother with it. The difficulty quickly ramps up as you are shown more and more gameplay elements. Unfortunately, so far add I have played, that is its only failing is that some levels become extremely demanding, while others seem much more a breeze. That would be fine if the difficulty were incremental, but as you play more levels in the beginning, the difficulty fluctuates rapidly. Despite this fact, this is a very well designed game that is very responsive and extremely artistic. A definite addition to any touch-gamers' apps. This is a game I could see winding up on Xbox Live Arcade.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a good app and I like it but I think it could use a bit more boosts I liked rio version and New York version
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow, never saw that coming.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn writes beautifully.  I read the first section slowly, highlighting many sentences and marveling at how well she expressed ideas.  Then I got sucked in and read sections 2 and 3 in one sitting, barely believing where the story took me.<br /><br />A great treat!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the series and Season 2 has lots to interest everybody.  The backstairs and the upstairs stories are well written and performed brillantly  Invest the short amount of time to watch the whole season and series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Terrific sequel and kids loooooove playing it. Gameplay is better and the presentation is just right. The rewards system is well built too.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical Harry Bosch stuff -- as expected it's a great read that you don't want to put down and Harry is his usual loveable self.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Game is very enjoyable!!!!<br />I would recommend this to all ages! Coins replenish in good time. Can play or two at anytime then come right back.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I kind of wish I'd had a game like this available back when I was studying public health in college. This game goes into a nice amount of detail when it comes to setting up the elements of your disease and really gives you a feel for what it takes to make an epidemic truly worldwide. It's pretty educational- and, yes, pretty disturbing. But I suppose that's the point of the game, isn't it?<br /><br />I've given it four stars instead of five because I was a bit surprised to see that nobody ever recovered from the disease on their own- you can take a very long time to make your disease deadly, because an infectee is an infectee until they become a corpse or until the plague is cured. Also I'm unsure why it pops up a note saying you've killed 75 million people, more people than the Black Plague, when you're not yet at 60 million deaths. Other than that I'm really quite happy with it, so add another star if you're good with that.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love the app.  Makes checking email on any device easy-breezy.  I can even manage my folders with absolute conveniemce from anywhere anytime.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Well written and directed. Each episode holds the viewers attention with witty dialogue, intriguing plots, and mind stretching logic. Hope it runs 10 years!
B007PVHANM|5.0|\\"Marley,\\" the most recent documentary about the life and work of Bob Marley, is perhaps the best documentary so far about the reggae superstar and Rastafarian missionary, and an absolute must-see for all reggae fans.  Interviews with Marley's family, friends and close associates provide rare insights into his life and character, not only as a world-famous entertainer and musical evangelist, but as a human being.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Marley\\" omits one of the best radio interviews with Bob Marley, the one done by Mumia Abu-Jamal for WUHY in Philadelphia during Marley's 1979 \\"Survival\\" tour.  Unlike corporate \\"mainstream\\" journalists, who recounted Marley's multiple relationships with women and sensationalized Marley's sacramental use of ganja (marijuana), Abu-Jamal focused on Marley's lyrical messages of African unity and resistance to oppression, and traced the spiritual roots of the Rastafarian movement in Marcus Garvey's back-to-Africa movement and the culture of the Maroons, Jamaican slaves who fled the plantations and established an independent society in the mountains.<br /><br />Although it is always saddening to be reminded of the tragic end to Bob Marley's too-short life, perhaps the most disturbing moment in the film occurs when Rita Marley mentions that the cancer in Bob's foot developed AFTER SOMEONE STEPPED ON HIS FOOT WITH A SPIKED BOOT during a soccer game.  This suggests that, rather than merely succumbing to a deadly combination of genetic and environmental factors, Bob Marley may actually have been murdered.  Considering the previous attempt on his life, and the murderous history of the CIA and American imperialism, this is horrifying but should hardly be surprising.  As Marley himself said (in \\"Redemption Song\\"), \\"How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very intersting novel. It draws you in and then it's hard to put down. I thought the ending was very provacative.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The subject matter of this novel is physical abuse on the main character and female sex slaves. It was just too disturbing.
1586638491|5.0|its great book. breaks down Shakespeare very well. left pages are the original text, right pages are the modern translation.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|that's all I have to say about that (if you haven't seen this movie, give it a try - very cool)
0060922583|5.0|After reading this book, I am really beginning to believe anything is possible. The book is not quite what I expected,but turned out to be more incredible than 90% of the books I have read. Several people have recommended I read this book, so I got a copy from Amazon.  I plan to read it several more times to make sure I really &#34;got it&#34;.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Never heard of them but just a single song on the radio and decided to buy the whole CD -- excellent band! I really like all of the songs on the CD, except maybe one or two (and even those I still like enough to listen w/o skipping). Will buy more of their albums. My wife and even the kids really like this band. A lot of passion and force in her lyrics, and what a voice!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My two daughters ( 8 & 5 years old) love this app! We give it two thumbs up for sure! Highly  recommend
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Book was heart breaking and heart warming! I loved it from page one!! Its a must read!! Could not put it down...grabs ahold of your heart!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great book. I woud highly recommend it to others. Great for high school students through college, I think. =]
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Good book but needed to move a little faster and include more of the characters from previous books.  Going to get book five to see where this is going, I hope.
B0019N95IK|5.0|FINALLY ON BLU RAY, CAN´T WAIT TO HAVE IT.<br />STILL I'M MAD BECAUSE IT ENDED SOONER THAN EXPECTED BUT ANYWAY, HERE IT IS ON HD.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I have just \\"purchased\\" this app ----- the double tap is supposed to rotate the puzzle piece but it doesn't work for me what am I doing wrong?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A great evolution for Angry Birds. The graphics are great and histerical, the addition of the story line is entertaining.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I will look at baseball with a new understanding. YOU WILL TOO!  It was a  fun read, entertaining and educational at the same time.
B0035S996U|5.0|great movie with a truly crazy antagonist.  The gangs they encounter are both colorful and dark and will make you laugh for a moment then absolutely disturb you
B007TNS6JI|5.0|good game i enjoy it and it keeps me entertained<br />i dont like that u need to buy jems to get the good stuff. but i guse all free games are like that so what do u want
B00881VLCE|4.0|A fun and colorful collection.  I enjoyed it very much. What a pleasant diversion when waiting on a doctor's<br /> appointment.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a fun novel to read. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. I found myself feeling giddy when the romance began. It brought a smile to my face, so Sparks must be doing something right. And the chapters from Kevin's POV were really intense, in a good way. I almost felt as crazy as he was feeling.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because of the big twist at the end of the book. I felt it was greatly unnecessary.
1881273156|4.0|I knew about this book from one of my friends from Germany, I bought it, read in a while and meditate, It is very interesting and useful if you want improve your marriage from good to best
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|No problem downloading onto my tablet and it worked fine the first time. It also has many feature that i'm still learning to enjoy and will be using in the future.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|i love this teen genre ... Riordan takes you on a great ride through greek mythology ... i really recommend
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome if your questioning to get this it has great graphics,one thing charging u, and there are levels,more than one person. So your choice but consider it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This app is super cool and I love to play it. When I get out my kindle fire this is the first thing I play.
B007M45PMU|5.0|the lumineers are a quite feat of their own uniqueness. this endearing album of songs are like the salvation of folk / americana galore. i cannot get enough of the song \\"dead sea\\" --- purely a gem! the beautiful \\"stubborn love\\" is like a chanting anthem for the life-love stricken, so memorable, i could take the line \\"keep your head up, my love\\" as a motto. all songs are great, i very highly recommend this record!
B005LAII12|5.0|I don't ever purchase DVD's for my home use but this movie was so funny and entertaining I had to buy it. This is one I will watch over and over again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the most riveting series I've ever watched! Many nights we watched 2 or 3 episodes, even though it got very late.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool if you do not have, you can not live with it, you must have the game the first I got I could not stop using it
B005K17RU0|3.0|Tells the weather.  Love it.  Kees me informed and has ads.  Its as accurate as Sam Champion on Good Morning America
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This book was excellent.  Although I did not see the movie I would recommend reading it if you haven't already.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love always having a bible with me. I like the availability of the audio versions. It helps get past some tough names, and allows me to listen to my reading plan on the way to work.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very engaging and well done.  I was a little up in the air with the ending.  Rather a dark novel.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a very moving emotional experience.  The scenarios and experiences that are conveyed are very intense and unsettling.  However, there is an almost childlike naive, but clear, view of serious adult themes and emotional issues that is refreshing.  Not for people who cant deal with complex issues, but is very insightful for those who want to look into some heavy topics.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|We were hesitant to rent this, since it seemed like it would be cheesy. But, our 12 year old has been watching the old series assiduously and we decided to give it a try. It was well worth it. Funny and a good cast.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have really been enjoying this game. I have always liked to play hidden object games and this one goes above and beyond. Drama combined with crime solving using hidden objects found along the way has incorporated a fun twist on the usual!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|What a fun movie. Worth watching over and over again. Oh yeah, the kiddies loved it, too. Gotta love the talking dogs (and the cone of shame).
B008Y78M60|4.0|We loved this movie - the cast was awesome - no big names but they did a great job!  I feel like I learned so much about Lincoln's assassination that I never knew - makes me want to learn more!
B00797MB0O|5.0|The plot line is amazing. If you liked 500 Days of Summer. You'll like this movie. Very similar type of dry humor. Great acting and great dialogues.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|this album has the privlage of landing The first Grammy for a female in the catagory of Best Hard Rock/ Metal Preformance for The song Love Bited(SO Do I)Amazon fails to mention this on there grammy winners and nominees page. again amazon drops the ball. But way to go to Halestorm for breaking new ground with their nomination and WIN of a Grammy!! i just hope it wont be their last.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Perfect - it is just what I needed for the GoPro Hero light add-on and it worked well. Just wish the bottom screw construction was a bit easier for ensuring the camera is fixed tight in the correct forward-facing position without too much effort required. But other than that, it makes me very happy being able to add light and audio accessories to my GoPro Hero camera. Great, thank you!
B00846F1YW|4.0|i like this alot.works very well on kindle fire.. quite the entrrtaining app. very nice. easy to see and easy to read
B0055SWM08|1.0|here's the thing it gust a button u press and get money out of.Also u cant play with other people
B000SC245E|5.0|Cheaper than new unit.  Have had much luck with this product in the past. Great service, ships in one piece.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry does it again. Slow, unrelenting investigating is his style that rarely fails. I've followed Harry Bosch since he was a rookie and have watched him mature into a cop,s cop and a family man. Loving every chapter and still unfolding conclusion to his life as  a detective. Hoping his daughter gets on the force before he retires.
0385484518|5.0|Excellent information, recipes, charts, etc.  Have shared book with several friends and all comment on the great information and how it's helped them.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My kids love it but Michelle love it more because she got to play Tinker Bell in the school play.
B0044IABFS|5.0|I don't really watch television, but this tv series had me hooked and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next after every episode
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My brother and I loved it. I would recommend it and I think that Shia LaBeouf did a good job in it.
B00433TO52|2.0|Yeah, all the works are there. If you are not experienced in reading shakespeare, this is NOT for you. The annotations that it claims to have are there, but there are not at the bottom of the page like they are in a book, you have to go search in the poorly designed appendix for the annotations.<br /><br />NO LINE NUMBERS. If you buy this for a college class, you will be lost. You may be able to search and find, but its hard.<br /><br />Formatting is often off and not always uniform, making it harder to read than necessary.
B003DT19F0|5.0|My kids love it but Michelle love it more because she got to play Tinker Bell in school. Thank You.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|One of King 's finest works.  So timely for a generation that has all but forgotten the precarious tightrope the world walked across to arrive at today.  And I fell in love with Sadie too George...
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I love all of the Resident Evil movies.Yes I would recommend it and I have recommend. I am looking for the next one.
0425252868|5.0|I'm not a big history buff, per se, but when a dear friend (I'm indebted to you, Mike!) lent me this book, I was immediately drawn in by this larger-than-life tale! What makes it interesting is knowing that you're reading a true story, and not mere fiction; it rivals any fictional story you'll ever read in its richness of characters, action, and story line!<br />  A few years ago my wife and I had the opportunity to tour the aviation museum (name forgotten, but easily located and enthusiastically recommended) in Palm Springs, California. We enjoyed perusing all of the vinatge aircraft there, but the most compelling aircraft there was a B-17!! A veteran of WW2 took us on a tour of the plane, and as a result of that visit, when I read the book, I had those memories to draw upon, making the book come to life even more!<br />  Buy this book, read it, and see for yourself what everybody's talking about!<br /><br />PS: GOOD NEWS! As of 2/11/13, I understand there are ongoing negotiations with several studios to bring this wonderful story to the big screen!! It has all the makings of a blockbuster, if it's done right!!<br /><br />Enthusiastically,<br />Michael Allen<br />The latest fan...
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I other it for my brother I did not see it. He liked it but wanting more action. Thank You.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I purchased these videos not expecting or knowing they would be packaged within a Jeannie bottle.  I was not pleased but they were a gift and the person I purchased them for said the dics being contained in a Jeannie bottle was alright.  I would have preferred a disc packaging.
0761163808|5.0|I saw this book promoted online and thought it would be a neat addition to our HS library.  I was not wrong.  The technology behind this book is amazing and my students have been enthralled with it.  I love the photicular aspect of the book.  The information included is also very interesting.
0385512058|3.0|Some good ideas but not quite what I was looking for. It turned out to be more of a self-help business manual on How are you? To cultivate contacts as friends and vice versa - rather cynical (I felt) but maybe that's the American Way...
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|take my word for it this game is GREAT my brother showed it to me on gjr computer for free buts its worth three dollars to have s portib
1439190275|4.0|Excellent updates if you're looking for some quick results - at least you get to eat fruit and veggies this time! However, in the light of Dr Mosley's BB Horizon program Eat, Fast and Live Longer - I would say go for the 5:2 diet and use Atkins for the 5 days only...worth a try.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is so awesome. It gives more of a challenge with more obsicals than the first game I love the ziplines! it also has WAY better graphics. you djoild get this game'
0670020745|4.0|After watching Jill's fascinating presentation on Ted Talks, I Just letting you know had to read her book. She writes simply and clearly and I learnt more about her background. Not the best narrative read though.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Characters not interesting and story sometimes difficult to follow. I don't like to not finish a book but I was close to giving up on several occasions
B00992CF6W|5.0|so much fun love it best game ever so worth the seven bucks love love love love love love love
B009NX409M|3.0|Just ok in my opinion.  Like both Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro so they were actually my draw.  Well acted by not a great movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I couldn't wait for this show to return. Watch an episode, but remember to breathe !!  One of the best shows on right now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series once you start watching you cant stop.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who loves watching a series based on history.
B002N2LEVM|4.0|This I think was a good enough show just the fact that it was canceled after about 2 seasons sucks
B004G600A4|5.0|As always, Disney does a great job of story telling in this version of Repunzel.  THe kids love it. The grand kids love it and I love it. Lots of fun for todays girls who like to combine adventure and romance.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Great book with in depth stories that don't make the front pages or typical history textbooks. Well researched and informed. Put new light on the nation's leaders and nuanced my view of others. Definitely worth the read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie.  But if you haven't read the book first, then you will miss out on lots of little but important details which give clearer meaning to the unfolding plot and the relationships in the movie.  Lots of action, emotional ride through to the end.  Well done with believable characters who remain pretty true to the book.  I can't wait for the sequel to come out next year.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was a great novel. It held my attention all the way throughout book. This rarely happens because I have short attention span. I would recommend this book to all fiction readers. I loved this book!
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|As a big fan of the first three I was leary of no Damon. However I was immediatly of with the premise as I started getting into the movie. But the movie really dragged on for me, especially the final chase scene. It was way too long and boring and unecessary. Bottom line, the movie bored me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game I get hooked on it for hours, I would recommend this game to everyone I know which I already did.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books - some more than others.  I liked The Black Box but not as much as some of his other books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of the greatest books in the world. It is so passionate and romantic. You should read this book and love it.
B009NX409M|4.0|I love the story; it's a tearjerker for me. Meryl is one of my faves and De Niro has great rapport with her in this movie. Seeing the fashions from the 80'a is always fun too :)
B005HYNCTK|5.0|As noted by at least a couple other reviewers -- and as is so often the case with Celibidache's interpretations -- it's not so much that his renditions are better or worse than others as it is that they are simply different. They wander into another dimension; it's like comparing apples and oranges, except that we're talking about he same score. Celibidache simply turns apples into oranges, which are neither better nor worse than apples, just different. I agree that you have to get acclimated to some of his recordings, while others seem perfect from the very beginning. His recording of Schumann's Rhenish Symphony is for me a case of the latter -- it struck me at once as a revelation. Here in the Bruckner symphonies, at least from No. 3 on, I've had to get used to a shift in perspective, and I must admit that over time I've come to gladly embrace that new panorama. It's not that I reject the other interpretations I was used to; rather, that I'm now including Celibidache's vision as a worthwhile and \\"correct\\" one -- along with other \\"correct\\" ones. If you want Bruckner that lifts you above the fray, even while it goes on all about you, this is the set to try.
0525952926|5.0|Like all of Ken's books focused on history, Ken  displays an excellent means to sustain keen interest in the way that he moves through events while using the human experience to retain captivation of the reader.<br />Having quit HS to join the U.S. Navy to go to Korea, I have learned considerable history through Ken's books.<br />Serving 32 years in USN combat aviation through the cold war and Viet Nam,<br />I Iook forward to the final Trilogy publication..<br />Joe
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|well written and very erotic in a guarded and interesting way. Suprise and interesting ending witch I didn't see coming
0547884591|5.0|When this book arrived, it was very poorly bound. Pages were falling out and the binding was set in crooked, and looked like every page would be separated from the binding in a week.<br />So I called Amazon immediately, and they Fedexed a replacement overnight.<br />The replacement book is excellently bound. The first one must have been a fluke.<br />I can't wait to thoroughly dig into this book. Already I see several things I want to try.<br />Thanks Amazon, thanks Tim.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Bad ending.  I was very much unimpressed with the way the movie switched forwrd and backward and frequently lost track
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I had never thought about dominating societies, but that is what we live in.  Never considered that we lve in a societal sctructure in which each has a dominant or subserviant roll of sorts and we treat each other that way.  Rosenberg describes a remote tribe in which  the term &#34;you are&#34; does not exist.  In other words there is no way to say &#34;you are wrong.&#34;  In our culture we so often talk to each other in ways that imply goodness or badness, guilt or innocense.  We blame issues and consequences oneach other.  We do all this without descriging our feelsings to those around us.  This is an amazingly idferent way of living with one another if we are willing to conside it.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Love the CD as well as all his predecessor CD's by Josh.  Could listen to Josh Groban's voice all day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Placement of the numbers on the calculator align the same as my regular one making it very easy to work quickly and accurately.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love Josh Groban and I have all his CD's.  This one is really special, and if anyone is out there that hasn't yet purchased one of his CD's this is the one to buy.  He is reaching out to a younger listener with the uplifting sound but he still retains that wonderful vocal sound for those of us over 50 who have come to love since I saw him on Alley McBeal years ago and got hooked to his voice and music.  Great job and continued great success to Josh......
B006LR0XLM|5.0|too bad very few free storage.., but it works great on my different pcs, keeps them always sincronized all the time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. It was free. It is like Temple Run but with a bit more to it. I really enjoy this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It fun and it has mission and thing to complete and daily challenges for us to do and the more win these mision it helps our score go higher .
B0090SI42Y|1.0|I guess I want to hear Quentin Tarantino tell me that this film merely reflects the flaws in our society, and its violent nature. Then he wants to remove my right to defend myself in my own home, after he supercharges some poor mentally unstable soul with his orgasmic violence and dismemberment scenes. Nothing like giving the up and coming Jeffery Dahmers of the world a little encouragement and a few more warped ideas.<br /><br />This is violence for violence sake, and I found no entertainment value in it. In light of the rash of recent mass murder sprees peppering our psyches, you might think Tarantino or Universal would hold back this heap of violence vomit. Oh no... that's right... they wanted to make a \\"two-fer\\" with this one, and some even hated the shorter version.<br />Spare me...
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Thsi is by far the best batman movie to come out.  Dark but not so dark.  Great villain and fight scenes.  Good ending.  It keeps your attention.  It deserves a second watch.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|We always enjoy Josh Groban but liked his first CD best.  I have a difficult time hearing (understanding) the lyrics.
B006IND5M8|4.0|The western theme was an enjoyable twist to a flick about alien invasion. Special effects made the movie work.  I would watch it again.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson.  I was so excited when this CD came out.  She is such a pure voice and a down to earth person.  Love most of her songs.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie was entertaining but not as good as the original.  Plot was confusing and acting was so,so.  Special effects were good. Lots of action scenes.
1401235417|5.0|I had never read comics before getting this. I've always been interested and have a working knowledge of a fair amount of characters but I've never owned an actual comic until now. All i can say is that this book is amazing! I would highly recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in batman or comic books in general, I will be purchasing more new 52 books including the next batman volume when it becomes available. This book is a gem.<br />P.S. - the artwork is fantastic.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love this show and I love the music.  The only down fall is that I feel that a lot of the songs are missing on the c.d
B0000024JN|5.0|Anyone who likes the Beastie Boys should definitely purchase this album, even if you've heard it all already. If you haven't, strap in and prepare for great rhymes, clean beats and some thick bass. I strongly caution anyone who leans toward cheaper headphones as the basslines in some of these songs will wreak havoc on lower quality drivers.<br /><br />Complete Track Listing:<br /><br />1. Rhymin' and Stealin'<br />2. The New Style<br />3. She's Crafty<br />4. Posse in Effect<br />5. Slow Ride<br />6. Girls<br />7. Fight For Your Right (to Party)<br />8. No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn<br />9. Paul Revere<br />10. Hold it Now, Hit It<br />11. Brass Monkey<br />12. Time to Get iLL<br /><br />Most of these tracks have pretty good bass, so I'd say make sure you have something that thumps pretty well. Enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've EVER read, hands down!  I could not put it down.  I got so emotionally invested in these characters and shed many tears.  I know for a fact I will remember this book for a long time.  It is a story that really makes an impact.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is free and fun!I hope u all like this app!You can take care of your pets like baths,food,and play!
B009NXV2RK|4.0|A great read. Action packed across several fronts.<br />If you enjoy Clancy you'll definitely enjoy this one.<br />Read it in a week.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This is the funniest book I can remember reading, I laughed out loud through the whole thing, have read Marian Keyes before and this is her best so far. Can't wait to read about the rest of the Walsh sisters!
0812416503|1.0|I have not read the book yet, but I am very disappointed in the quality of the book, it's junk; I bought the hard back to add to my library. The print is tiny and goes from the top of the page, I mean the leading edge of the top of the page. Several of the pages are skewed and print is blurry. Do not buy this edition of this book.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Do not waste you time with this app!  Literally every minute the full screen goes to an ad which you then have to click the return arrow which goes to the restart screen then you can resume play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While  I would not give this five stars for actual writing ability, the author is able to catch your attention and bring you in to the world of two extremely opposite personalities, background, moral fiber, temperament and more - Christian and Anatasia.  Bought book 2 with anticipation that Anatasia can bring Christian closer to her world and understand the true meaning of love and nurturing each other.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Excellent story line played by top notch actors fit for the parts. I got this as a gift for my dad. he loved the story but wasn't too keen on the MMA fighting style. I guess he's a die hard Rocky style kind of guy. All that said I recommend this move. It will win your heart and have you jumping on the couch with excitement.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this book was easy and delightful to read. I think it could of had more of a suprise at the end.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Filmmakers pulled a fast one on this. So afraid were they to tell us what kind of film this really is, an alcoholic spiraling downward, that it's no wonder so many people are turned off. And it's not that it's even well done, it's not. As for the title, unless those involved want to imply it's Denzel's flight from responsible behavior, it's really just a con job. The love story is shoe-horned into the plot, likewise the gratuitous nudity, the ridiculous presentation of people with faith is an eye-roller, the John Goodman character is from another type of film and the addiction scenes we've seen in other, better films. And don't get me started on the unlocked connecting hotel doors! And how did the filmmakers manage to lose the audience's sympathy for Denzel's character? I'll give it this, the plane sequence was spectacular (but so was the plane sequence in CASTAWAY, also by Zemeckis). Denzel's great, but the script and direction are working against him. Proceed with caution.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|My 7 year old loves this. All lego is well made, fun and I swear, it creates future engineers. Ever engineer I know was a lego freak.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|Robert Pattison plays a role of 28 year old billionaire who has made his fortune playing the stock and currency market.  Almost the entire movie is filmed inside of his long, stretched limo where he seems to spend most of his time: meeting his business partners, hookers, friends, random people.  They talk about anarchy, money, information, art, music.  It is almost as if this young man with so much money has nothing better to do but prove that anything and everything can be bought.  As he plays the (stock) market, he suddenly decides to go across town and have a haircut in the old heighborhood where he grew up.  The old barber happens to be his father's friend and that is how we learn that this billionaire's father died when he was only five years old.  One cannot but wonder if his mathematical and methodical mind in an attempt to make sense of his fatherless childhood, prove that one can be successful (financially) even without male role model in his life.<br /><br />However it seems that this young man has something that he cannot buy.  His wife comes from old money and as crude and raw as he is, she is refined and cultured.  They are at odds because they seem to live on the opposite ends of the world.  He drives in a stretched limo, she takes a NYC cab around the city; his entertainment are random people that enter his limo while her world is solitude in the local bookstore; he is busy making love to women who are of questionable character while his wife goes to the theatre, elegant and quiet and the only hint of her distress is her attempt to smoke a cigarette which she does not even seem to enjoy.  His life is life of excess, her life is more measured, calm and orderly.  Their devide becomes apparent when he admits to her he is about to loose all of his money to the bet he made on the stock market against chinese yuen currency.  She  quietly offers him money so he can start fresh - in exchange for freedom (read divorce) he seems to crave.  It is only the expression on his face that makes viewer realize that this man would do anything to keep his wife, but the nature of their relationship give a whole new meaning to the term \\"irreconcilable differences\\".  For her, it is easy to explain her stand.  She says to him: \\"I am not indifferent.  That makes me susceptable to pain.\\"<br /><br />As film progresses it almost seems that main character's internal turmoil is expressing itself with riots happening outside of his limo.  No one can make sense of it and other than anger and despair and resentment towards polarity that surrounds all protagonist - nothing particularly original.  It almost took me an hour before the film grabbed my full attention.  One action that the main character does changes the entire course of story and of course his destiny.  Seemingly with nothing left to loose: his marriage is over, his money is lost, he committs an act that is a statement that he gives up on his life; he finally decides to confront his stalker (played by Paul Giamatti) and that encounter I found somewhat disappointing.  However, the end will let you hanging and you can make you own choices on how all of these characters end up.  Subtle references to Erik Satie, Mike Rothko, anarchy and monks who set themselves to fire in order to make a (political or ideological) statement all leads us to one conclusion.  Here is a 28 year old man who has it all with nothing else left to prove.  For a man like that is there anything left in life he has not done, felt or experienced yet?  You be the judge.sion on his face that makes viewer realize that this man would do anything to keep his wife, but the nature of their relationship give a whole new meaning to the term \\"irreconcilable differences\\".

B00APUQRPC|4.0|This is a good baseball movie. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams were stellar.It is interesting to see what the low minors are like in the daily grind.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love the game. Everyone said they could not get past level thirteen. I had no problems. . I am on level seventeen. Love the graphics sound is great. I usely cant get very far in this kind of game. It is not to hard to fine the objects. The only part I am not fond Of is the dark rooms. The spot light makes it hard to find if you have a problem with your eyes. But I am glad I got the game. Will get more of their games.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Little slow at first but I still couldn't put it down, there was just always a mystery at every turn of the book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Ms Collins drew me in and kept me turning pages from the minute I opened the first Hunger Games book!  I'm not a great fan of this genre but I immediately took to this series.  Mockingjay was excellent, but I wouldn't rate it quite as high as the first book in the series.  I think she worked too hard to wrap up every little detail instead of letting the story flow.<br /><br />I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it, though.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Well written with some lovely prose and pithy descriptions of human emotions. It did drag a little in the middle for me,<br />and was a very dark view of Barcelona (cold, rainy, depressing) which was a sunny, warm vibrant city during my visits.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I chose this because this is one of my favorite movies; I'm SO glad to be able to see it again! (Flashdance)
B00821OX98|3.0|Part 1 was stop & go action, and part 2 would never start (I'm talking video streaming from Amazon). The show itself might be pretty good, if we could watch it...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I now speak with a British accent. LOL. The story continues to captivate me. Congratulations on a successful story telling venture!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't love angry birds? This a great game to pass the time.  My kids love to play all the angry birds games
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is fun - but if you've gotten bored of the first one, this probably won't renew your thirst for stealing idols and escaping mutant monkeys.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Who doesn't love angry birds? It is a great way to the pass the time when waiting in line or if you need to keep the kids quiet for a bit :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Could not put the book down.  I loved it.  The end left you hanging but will read other books from this author.
075669812X|5.0|My son absolutely loves Legos, especially Lego Ninjago! I got him this book as a Christmas gift and it is one of the only things that he keeps going back to and re-reading. This book is filled with lots of fun facts about different characters and even comes with a minifigurine.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|A real page-turner. Be prepared to lose some sleep. I started reading it without expectations, but was gripped after the first 30 pages.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just ordered the trilogy.  I have not began to read it yet.  I'm saving it for a rainy weekend read.  I've read previews & know that I will love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was so much fun to watch. The characters, the costumes, the acting are all superb.  I cannot wait for Season 3!!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|First the negatives from my perspective:<br />It's written in the first person - this is merely personal preference, but I generally don't like novels written in the first person.<br />He uses very short sentences, at times making the story feel very choppy.<br />Other than that, and its really not a major criticism, it's a great read.  I couldn't put the book down as Child had me hooked into the story from beginning to end.  I specifically chose this book because I knew it was the first Jack Reacher story.  I now consider myself a fan and have read two more since.  There is a clear improvement in writing style in subsequent Reacher novels, but this first one is a great read!
B009A9EYUO|5.0|Not much to say about this album that hasn't been said before. An all time great album, Rage's best, and that's sayin something because their next two are excellent as well.<br /><br />I purchased this on vinyl. Not a lot of extras or frills with the vinyl, but it sounds good and Amazon packaged it well.<br /><br />Buy it!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|The House at Riverton kept my attention by immersing me in the families and the time period (early 20th century) and especially through the author's use of narration. Told by Grace, a servant, from a perspective both past and present, this novel invokes the intrigue and drama of the lives of the characters...much like Downton Abbey keeps me eagerly tuning in to PBS each week.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|After trying to play this several times, i just removed it from my kindle because it would not load at all.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I may not be fond of John Mayor's as a person but as an artist he is incredibly talented. This album is defiantly one of his best.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was meant for a much younger audience, the dialogue was unnatural and the ending was predictable. Truthfully, the author lost me the first time the protagonist fainted. I'm not a big fan of women fainting as a plot point. There were some enjoyable parts, but overall I felt it could have been developed further.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime is a great read, with lots of twists and turns. It was a very insightful look into the mind of a boy that thinks differently than me. A book that you don't want to put down because you want to know what will happen next, it is very worth your time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Five stars in a book review tends to raise people's suspicions but in this case it's well worth it. Fantastic character development, fantastic plot that went in directions I never suspected. I like a dark read and this was dark!
B0088TG252|4.0|I wish there was a little more selection on your current movies, but this is a good start.  Decent show
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. highly addictive. one of the best free games I've ever downloaded for my kindle fire!! extremely fun and creative!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a great show and I'm glad I'm able to watch it so soon after airing.  Keep up the good work!
B004XN3FHA|2.0|It uses something other than a bulb.  It is very bright and came in handy during hurricane sandy, but stopped working after 1 week of use.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|It is tough to replace the first season, but it was an okay end to the series.  I do like having this selection available.
0525478817|5.0|in the \\"suggested buys\\" portion of the page is The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, and like, yeah...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show and I'm glad I'm able to watch it so soon after airing.  Keep up the good work!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I gave this as a gift. We watched this three times through. A nice bonus to have all three dark knight movies together.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is a great show and I'm glad I'm able to watch it so soon after airing.  Keep up the good work!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I read the bible, it makes my life so much at peace.  This app is one of the best  ones I have on my tablet.  The bible version is the same as my hard copy bible.  I now don't have to worry about torn pages or carrying my bible around, this app covers everything, its easy to use and its easy to read. I recommend this app for anyone that keeps God in there lives day to day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show and I'm glad I'm able to watch it so soon after airing.  Keep up the good work!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Got the game for my daughter but me and my wife play it way more.... I do wish more characters would make cameos but then it would alter the premise of the game.  My kid is almost 3 and plays it fine, doesn't get all the gnomes but can pass the levels efficiently with some explanation (lasers and such).
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Was very easy to read. It had characters you wanted to follow. I read it cause the first movie was alright, so wanted to see how the characters continue on.
B00846F1YW|3.0|relaxing so far. I take it as the game progresses I will see more of a challenge. I can not wait.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|This is a really cute little game. Not too difficult. What is awesome about this game is the illustrations!! What a beautiful background. It was the free app of the day so how could I really go wrong?
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It was great to see all the hero's working together in this one..A little corny, but after you get over that it was ok..
0790729393|1.0|Fortunately I did not buy this overlong piece of crap.  I recorded it from TV and was glad it was to an RW disc (which can be erased and written over).  I forced myself to watch the whole thing to see if there were any redeeming segments.  Nope.  Some of the following may be story line giveaways, although I wouldn't expect anyone to care.  Sleepers is a good name for this since it becomes so tedious.<br /><br />This is an all-male sleeze fest despite the token mop-head Driver, who didn't belong in it.  I won't go into the whole lurid mess since others have already done that.  There are no redeeming characters and none with whom you can identify (I hope).  The guards in the reform school are sadistic homosexual perverts with a preference for boys.  After the four boys get out, two of them shoot the guard that molested and tortured them the most.  The second half of this sleeze-fest is about the trial in which one of the boys, who has become a lawyer (Brad the Pits) perverts the law with the help of a lying priest to get the killers off.<br /><br />This movie tries to show there is no absolute truth, the end justifies the means, and \\"proves\\" the theories of relative values taught in schools.  All this takes place in the arm-pit of America, NYC's Hell's Kitchen, which is appropriately named.  Why some reviewers here say they like to see this crap over and over I cannot imagine.  Some have said they will remember this forever.  I would assume they meant they were permanently scarred psychically.  The two killers die violently before age 30.  The \\"candid\\" photos of their bloodied corpses were added graphically at the end of the move as if to \\"improve\\" this garbage for those fond of \\"reality TV\\".
B009K86D86|5.0|This was my second time seeing it, had to show it to my wife. Contains information on how the majority of the protein we eat is raised in poor conditions and being fed things nature did not intend. Not just protein though, good info on produce also.
B006U1I2MQ|4.0|This was a long book (for me) but a quick read.  Gaimen has a knack for storytelling and what I would call a consistent and original imagination.  Both are fully on display here.<br /><br />I think, though, that I was disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe a book like this can't sit a dozen years, waiting for a reader to get to it.  I think I missed the significance of the imagination, and have trouble judging it, in a market saturated with the ideas.<br /><br />I have to assume those ideas, flooding our imagination market for a dozen years, put out by weak and derivative writers, owe much of their existence to Gaimen's imagination.  Still, I cannot put myself back so far in the past and experience the thrill properly.  So, much of the color of this novel gets missed.<br /><br />Lesson learned:  A Pulitzer can wait, but when a book wins Hugo and Nebula, read it warm.
0788859544|5.0|I bought this video for my toddler grandkids.  They love it, and I love snuggling up and watching it with them.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Kept our interest. We liked the surprising twists. The part John Goodman played was perfect for him. Would recommend to friends.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My little toddler granddaughters love this movie.  After the first time of &#34;talking through&#34; the scary parts, they were not afraid of the beast anymore.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|You cannot just open this game and play once.  You will play over and over, trying to better your previous time.  Great game for filling idle time.  It is also a time waster..ha ha.  I have suggested this to so many people and now they all hate me because they are addicted too.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I think its ok cause when you get all the pots it doesn't let you go on I'm like seriously!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have both the Quell games and loved playing both of them.  Challenging, but not impossible.  Great game concept and definately makes you think.  I like the reset button, as it is hard to get a game perfectly the first time at the higher levels.  Beautiful graphics.  I have gotten several people hooked on this game, even my elderly Mom.
B005VPRDAY|1.0|I didn't know you could purchase the same item at a whole variety of prices - depending on what &#34;page&#34; you happened to land on.  It sold for 14.97 one place and I paid 32.00 for it thinking it was an upgrade.  It was actually the same exact product..Amazaon was good about taking the return.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Only knew a little about this movie from trailer on TV and Washington being nominated for award(s) for his acting. I found it so-so. Other than exciting in beginning, mostly is a drama about alcoholism, which is not a bad story but I am not sure I needed to see or \\"feel\\". I do not know, perhaps other movies have dealt with the subject or perhaps not. I guess it is an important topic to address and Washington being an airline captain puts emphasis on the danger. So in the end, not an action movie or love story, a drama, slow prodding drama that is predictable. Would I watch again? NO. Oh, and Washington for an acting award? I don't see it myself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app for the christian soul!!! Will recommend to anyone growing in the faith of catholic because of the free bilbles and tools!! Daily study plans readings are the best!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As title, the book is awesome. Moving on to book two. Filling in the blanks. . . . . .
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandson loves this game and plays it a lot, he loves to get the piggies and watching them while he plays!
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I'm afraid the &#34;Bourne&#34; series has had it's run. Most everything was predictable and the ending was at best disappointing. The chase scene through Manila was very good, (Not Great). This is a good rental, nothing more.
B000002VMD|5.0|A great Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner movie.  What there not to like if you singing and romance this is it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The twists and turns in the plot were great. The housekeeper rocks as well. I am a prime member so I got the movie for free but I would gladly pay for it. I am not a big fan of horror at all but this one had me riveted.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is the best in the world.  Anything you are looking for you are able to find it in Google.  Need help go to google there is nothing like it.
B003MC5N28|3.0|This book isn't bad, but is a bit, well, boring at parts. The deep meaning is very good though. So, yeah.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so challenging and so intense.  You have really got to pay attention to this game.  It is fast and can really frustrate you when you are trying to get so many points and not able to do so.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Maybe the hype was just too much, but for us this was short of the 'best Bond ever.'<br /><br />Better than Quantum but not as entertaining as Casino Royale.<br /><br />That said, Craig is the best Bond in my opinion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a 3 year old grandson who loves to play this game.  I like the game but have not had a chance to play it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was spellbound by the first season. The second didn't disappoint. This show is a classic that will be viewed over and over again. I hope it goes on forever. I felt like I was a fly in the wall watching the pagentry of the gentry, the contrasted lives of the servants, all entertwined with the social and economic changes of the early 1900's.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this over Christmas at the urging of my daughter. The first few episodes were tough for me, but now I'm hooked. Just purchased streaming for Season Three. Try it, you'll love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The World War I era is fascinating in itself, but when you add the drama of the impact of the changes taking place in one of England's great estates, it makes for great entertainment I couldn't stop watching until I had seen every episode of the first two seasons. Then, I couldn't wait for the third season to start to catch up, not only, with the lords and ladies of the manor, but the staff &#34;downstairs.&#34;
B005BOHYW2|5.0|A wonderful and moving challenging read during which I learnt so much about realtionships, flowers and staying the pace in relationships
B008B68IV8|5.0|this doll is a cheap and wonderful addition to any collection big or small! Whoever receives this as a present should love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The thing is more realistic looking than the first version. This is one of the best games out there. Buy it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game and it is better than the original. I did have a few issues where getting saved crashed the game. The update has fixed this issue though and everything is great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I liked how it followed the first book. I immediately borrowed the third book after completing this one.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its very creative and I enjoy it because its one game I can play without internet all the time and you get to play with animals
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This is the first book in about 10 years that I finished. I loved that it was so long. I was so engrossed in this book that I would dump my friends while on a luxury cruise liner to go and read my book. I recommend anyone who loves suspense should read it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Technically believeable and well researched!  The story reads very well...so well in fact that sub-vocalization can kick in and the good mental images are formed from the descriptions.  A good blend of humor and drama and a story pace that keeps the reader engaged.  Well done.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|A frank autobiography of the trials and tribulations of living under a fatwa in the UK, Europe and the USA. He comes across as a somewhat self-centered person and is incilned to overdo the name dropping.
0307387178|5.0|Great book to read but there is one thing that really bothered me ....it was a gradual effect .....I found myself very depressed after reading this book..................The movie is good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Such a fun game... for all ages. I'm 15 and I own 6 real horses, but having this fake one is so cool :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its really fun and since I cant have a real horse this is the next best thing......you should really get this app
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I gave this Season of this show the four star rating because its<br />very exciting and well thought out anyone who loves<br />suspens and the feeling of fear and American Horror Story Asylum deffantly provides<br />That rush a thrill seeker is looking for
B000ICXQXS|5.0|This movie is a classic not only for the superb acting but also for the soundtrack of Scott Joplin tunes.
B004GFN11A|1.0|Tried using it three times-each time it locked up my Kindle Fire HD. Don't know what the problem is and, frankly, don't have the patience to troubleshoot and fix another developer's item.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I recommend Rick Riordan`s books to to almost every one I meet . I really like the Greek Mythology books by Rick Riordan. I think everyone should try reading these books.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|There are TWO versions of this: the version I bought had both the DVD and two CDs and cost the same as the DVD-only version. Check the details. DVD-only version is still worth the price!
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Here is an easy note-keeping app that makes it easy to jot something down with a finger or with typing.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|What I like best about Downton Abbey is the acting and the social history it opens up to my child, who isn't familiar at all with any of it. And of course, it's done in a most entertaining way - entertaining enough to keep an 11 year old intrigued. What I like least is the script's tendency to devolve into soap opera, but I think many people, including my child, love this aspect. The actors themselves are not in the least deficient!<br /><br />The costumes and setting are glorious. The streaming experience here is not as good, however, as it is on a streaming platform with which most of you are more familiar. I think Amazon will iron out the kinks, but the viewing experience for Season 1 was seamless, while our new source, here, is rather clunky and not invisible at all. I'm sure this must be something Amazon is working on. We look forward to continuing to watch it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this whenever I'm on my KindleFire to peruse the other interests of my family and friends. Always interesting ideas.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched this on my Kindle and loved it. It is so bizarre and strange and scary and I couldn't wait to down load the next episode!
B003O86FMW|5.0|So easy to read and keeps you engaged. Hard to put down. Would consider this a must read series for teens and above
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am so happy that I found this.  Now when I need a calculator it is right beside me on my kindle and I do not have to get up and search for the calculator.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Liked this product. Not a name brand but the price is good and the quality is decent. delivered quickly. serves its purpse well.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.
B003THJA1G|5.0|One of the best shows on TV...the entire Family loves it....we just found it and are pleased to be able and go back to catch up on previous season
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is nice to play. I use this app in kindle fire and I don't find any bugs and the app works fine. This can be rated as one of good games that is free
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app for the puzzle difficulty paired with the mindlessness of playing.it's a great way to de-stress while at work or waiting for an appointment.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game to help improve your sense of observation. Has many different levels and skills needed. Must be careful on what tiles you move.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|The book has an interesting premise.  Unfortunately, it is chock full of made up cuss words.  These were distracting, at best, and really were unnecessary for the story.  I did get caught up in the story and was hoping for a satisfying ending, but I was disappointed.  I had no desire whatsoever to get the other books.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I haven't been able to get this game to open on my Kindle Fire so I haven't played it.  I have tried several times
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My utmost favorite show on television.. hands down! If I were to recommend one show you invest in .. this is the one!!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Love the adventures of Ivan. And a great way to see how everyone's fav characters are doing thru the eyes of a new character.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Overall, Downton Abbey as a series has lived up to all of the hub-bub!  There were just a few loading issues sometimes using Prime.  Occasionally it would freeze but usually after closing out some programs and starting it over it worked just fine.  Prime free streaming is awesome!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will not go see the movie.  I cannot imagine it could capture the emotions, thoughts, or imagery in the book.  Hate the premise but loved the books.
B00A5052YE|1.0|This was a good song till Niki Manaj ruined it by talking about god in the middle of the song.<br />I hate it and wish I had bought the original version.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Could not put this one down. Edge of your seat not only for the description of the action but for the respect and worry and concern you feel for the men on the mission.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book started off a little slow and I was tempted to set it aside.  I am so glad I stuck with it.  The plot was quite unique.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|There are many twists and turn for Ethan to find Lena again and it takes you deeper into the Caster World....I Loved It!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Strings you along on to a sweet predictable ending. Nice reading, just didn't connect with the characters. what happened to dad People. IS HE STILL reading historical novels. He was forgotten in the book. I expected more, but enjoyed several quotes. Read it, but don't rush out to get it.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR mindless reading SUCH as a beach book.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|A thoroughly well told and engrossing story which I consumed at two sittings.  Mr Connelly is still writing at the top of his form and Harry Bosch remains, to my mind, the pre-eminent character in modern crime fiction. While Harry is ageing, the plots and the characters remain fresh and engaging. If Mr Connelly has more stories in him, I want to read them all.
0385360177|5.0|The 2 book is better than the 1st but the 3 rd book is better than the 2nd book . The whole set was great
B0034G4P1W|2.0|I guess I was expecting this movie to be as good as &#34;Chicken Run&#34;.  But it was really lame. I should have rented it first. I will always was a movie first before buying.
0385360185|5.0|I would be so involved in listening to the book I would take the long way home to finish listening to it
0199535906|5.0|this novel is wayyy better than harry potter !! if your into magic and sorcery stories this book is a must read!! full of action, love, and drama ! this book is perfect in condition also !! worth the read!! :-)
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I can say this was the best purchase I've made in months.  There is not one bad track on this album.
1427210241|3.0|The key was Mat Caldron for me, the new guy just did not understand Mat, and he was a key to the humor part of the story.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|just what do they have in common? occasional sexy romps lead to true love and a complete change of attitude?
B000VZBCWE|5.0|This is one of the best Queen shows of all-time. If you are building a concert DVD collection and want to add Queen to it, I would totally recommend this one. It's got all the great songs, and they have a lot of energy.
B0093ST02E|3.0|Boring life, boring wife with boring husband,then grahic sex with new man. Then back to boring.Then it ends with her going back to whatever she was dreaming about.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|One of the few games that keeps my son who has autism focused and makes him laugh... It's very helpful when we have to take a long ride  in the car or wait for an appointment.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This is the best take off from a movie I have seen ! I would indeed give the movie and the series a 5 star rating, as well as the movies that followed after the series ended.<br />I would also suggest people consider watch Star Gate Atlantis as well .<br />Did not like how they ended STA , but still worth watching .
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The movie is easy to watch, although don't watch it if you are about to fly...<br />Denzel is good as always. Good movie to watch on cold winter night,
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It need a little more work. The most important part of the movie was Will Smith character finding out about his father.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Free version gives all the clock you need but you wonder what  the upgrade would add.I have already used the alarm and the timer(for grilling) &look forward to using when e travel. Should be a standard feature on Kindle.
B009T3AHDE|1.0|In all honesty I started playing the movie and after 20-25 minutes took it out of the Bluray player never to put it in the machine again. In Aussie language BLOODY AWFUL should draw and quarter everyone associated with it. Has the distinction of the worst movie of viewed in 25 years.<br /><br />Please no-one else be as stupid as I was to believe a couple of reviews and bought it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|The plot is fun and Tintin is unique and quirky. Graphics are colorful and fluid. 1930's settings cars and planes feel like an episode of Poirot. I'm looking forward to the next episode.
B004XC5LP0|4.0|As usual Pierce Brosnan does a stellar job with an interesting and truly believable plot, no fantasy stuff involved and he's ably supported by good acting.
B00873GRU4|4.0|Great read! A fresh post-apocalyptic dystopian novel that had me frantically turning the pages. Apart from a drop in pace in one section it moved along quickly dealing with lots of themes like social control, freedom, friendship, and whether ignorance is truly bliss. One of the most satisfying pieces of fiction I've read. Some great characters. Looking forward to more by this author!
B000OVLBFS|4.0|A good series that has provided Tom Sellick an outlet to provide some good acting whilst keeping the suspense to the end as a whodunit thriller.
038572179X|5.0|I think I've attempted to read \\"Atonement\\" about four or five times. Each time, I would get a few chapters in and sigh in boredom. What made this book so amazing? Why was it on so many lists? Why did people gush about it? It was incredibly slow-starting, didn't seem to have any real plot, and the writing, while gorgeous, didn't exactly move at a hurried pace. This time around, I was determined to stick with it, and I now understand the magic of this book. It's only in losing yourself in the detail that you are able to really comprehend the message of this book, the innocence (and loss of it) that is portrayed, the richness of the characters and the true meaning of its setting.<br /><br />Briony Tallis is a thirteen-year old girl who has written a play for her older brother Leon's homecoming. Unfortunately, due to an impending divorce in the family, her cousins from the North, fifteen-year old Lola and her younger twin brothers, Jackson and Pierrot, have come to stay and will therefore star in her theatrics. Frustrated with their lack of effort to the project, Briony decides to shelve the play idea and is determined to become a writer - a true writer. The idea of a ten-minute performance that is about love and lessons is too simplistic for her; she is going to write about something real, something important. When the maid's son, Robbie Turner, hands her a note for her older sister, Cecilia, she reads it. And when her cousin Lola is raped, she jumps to horrible conclusions in her quest to create a drama that is worthy of her new adult status.<br /><br />It is Briony's testimony - despite her lack of evidence - that allows an innocent man to be convicted of a horrible crime. Before he can return home, though, World War II breaks out. We go from Briony's misguided intentions straight to the evacuation of Dunkirk and experience retreat through the eyes of Robbie Turner, who has served five years in prison for something he didn't do. What is it like to become immune to dead bodies piled along the road, to see people doing whatever it takes to survive?<br /><br />But the war changes more than just Robbie. Both Briony and Cecilia become nurses and experience different things in the weeks leading up to the London blitz. Briony is determined to set the record straight and clear Robbie's name, but it's something easier said than done. Will her attempt to do the right thing even matter in the end?<br /><br />With vivid language and an absolutely heart-gutting ending, \\"Atonement\\" is indeed everything it was promised to be. Yes, it's a slow starter. But once you get over the initial hurdle (aka 'Part 1'), it is a page-turner that has you hoping for a happy ending that may or may not be meant to be.
B0070BG10U|4.0|A thoughtprovoking piece of music that made me imagine myself on that beautiful ship,and all that followed.<br />  The late Robin Gibb and his son R.J combined to make Titanic Reqiem a lovely piece of orchestral music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a totally awesome game that I think everybody should play and experience:)!Subway Surfers is also appropriate for kids.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It works perfectly in my house when all the computers are connected to the same router but is not working from outside when I am trying to connect from my office
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had been hearing about this show online for a while but didn't check it out until recently.  Watched the first season on Netflix and loved it.  Got the second season here and it's even better than the first.  I can't wait to see what Season 3 holds.  Definitely worthy of the hype.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nice little app with a variety of fast playing games. Little to no bugs and runs smooth. Levels are easy to unlock.
B00AXVH8KQ|4.0|Although my husband doesn't care for them (and he's arguably the more discerning between us), I love this disc!  I can't wait to put it on every chance I get.  It's catchy while being different than anything else, certainly anything else on the air these days!  The whole thing has a very retro vibe owing - as others have noted - to some riffs that were no doubt pulled wholecloth from other times and bands (one chorus *is* \\"Suspicious Minds\\" with other lyrics).  It's a lot of fun to listen to, I think, and stands up to repeated listens.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. My friend raved about it so I picked it up- I found that it took a bit of time to get into but once you get about 20% of the way in, you can't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I think this is one of sparks best. The story is truly captivating. I felt myself always wanting to read more. I think this is the best book I've ever read. Strongly consider this book. It is amazing.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I found Iron Man to be very entertaining. Robert Downey Jr is such a impressive actor. He is such a relax,action pack hero. I love the chemistry between Gweneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. It was a fun movie. I highly recommend it.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game drains my battery quicker than any of the other games on my Kindle. I like it, it's fun to play
B001EBYM8A|5.0|The Fugitive keeps you on the edge of your seat. The derailed Train scene is phenomenal. The story line is good. It has twist and turns as well as a lot of action. It is a must see.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I like this game and have played several hands in one sitting.  However, 1) the computer prompts you much too soon to draw a card before you've had a chance to review your hand and decide on your own to draw; 2) the computer forces you to use your special cards when it's not part of your stratge, don't want too use for that round. I like the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. The story is so deeply effective to the reader, yet it still plays in humor at just the right times in an otherwise serious topic of cancer. This is a must-read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sooo fun. Makes you want a horse. This game is surprisingly addicting and entertaining.<br />I would definitely recommend for kids!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book had a very appropriate way of addressing the sensitive topic of suicide while creating a realistic, moving story for reders at a middle school + age level to read. I thought the writing was excellent.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I've only played it a couple of times, but found it fun.<br />I'm not sure it is as challenging as I would like, but still fun.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Great Movie, Oscar should go to this one.  Loved it.  Thank you for making it available on VOD, really appreciate it.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Baseball scenes didn't quite line up with reality (front office dynamics and stats vs. scouts was contrived), but interesting characters and enjoyable scenes made up for lack of realism.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I often think big-budget Hollywood movies fail to meet their potential. Considering the millions of dollars invested to produce a film, the hundreds of people employed, the endless weeks, months, years of revising the script, I guess when I press play I expect something pretty spectacular. But like a lot of movies I see, Flight left me wondering why it wasn't.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the subject matter really. Of course alcoholism is something that touches the lives of a lot of people. The problem is that any film that dares to tackle this kind of story has a pretty impressive act to follow: The Days of Wine and Roses, Leaving Las Vegas, Factotum -- just a few of the better films about alcoholism that come to mind. I would think a new release would at least attempt to meet the bar set by these earlier examples. Unfortunately, Flight seems perfectly content with its more shallow treatment of the topic.<br /><br />Actually I think this film would have fared better if alcoholism had been left out of the picture completely. The flight trauma scenes in the beginning are top-notch Hollywood movie making, and are strong enough that I think the entire film could have taken place inside that plane (Airport 1975?). Instead, Flight uses a plane crash early on to simply set the stage for the rest of the story, which in its own way seems chaotic and out of control.<br /><br />A good example of this is the character Harling Mays (John Goodman), an overly-comical, overly-stereotyped drug dealer straight off the pages of a Quentin Tarantino script. It's a horribly awkward transition whenever Goodman enters a scene, and makes me think that Flight was probably rushed through production without much thought about what really makes sense in the movie, and what doesn't.<br /><br />Can't knock the performance by Denzel Washington, though. I think he's a stunning actor who can make even the most unbearable movies somehow worth watching. I hope movie lovers are familiar with his better films -- The Book of Eli, Malcolm X, The Hurricane.
0786955570|4.0|The D&D Castle Ravenloft board game is a fun game to play when you're stuck inside the house.  You can play solo or with others and features infinitely changeable environments so no two games are the same.  There are 13 adventures to be completed and each adventure takes a few hours to finish, so there is a ton of replayability and story to this game.  You don't need to be a D&D or fantasy fan to enjoy this game.  It even features a limited level-up capacity for the character(s) you choose, making this of interest to those who are used to standard RPGs.<br />The only drawback I see is the order of actions as stated in the rules can get a little confusing and complex, making this a game you won't necessarily be able to just open right up and dive in with.  It takes a little while to get used to the mechanics.  It also takes a while to unpack and sort all the little pieces that come with this game so the first time you play this make sure you have at least 4 hours or so to really get prepared and play through the first adventure.<br />I recommend this for anyone who likes board games and is willing to try something original, just so long as you're okay with taking an extended amount of time the first playthrough for physical setup, organization and getting used to the play mechanics.
0062127241|3.0|I almost wish I hadn't read this book. Before I read it, I had a generalized opinion of Pete Townshend as a great songwriter, singer and rhythm guitar player. Those opinions haven't changed, but I think much less of him as a person now. The callous way he glosses over the death of Keith Moon, the breakup of his marriage to  his long-suffering wife Karen, and to a lesser degree the death of John Entwhistle, is pretty jaw dropping.<br /> If you buy this book looking for a detailed history of the Who, you'll get some of that. But the majority of the book is about Pete and nothing but Pete. The last third of the book, if not more, features a dizzying chronology of \\"I started this project, I bought this boat, I bought this house, I built this studio, I started writing this book/play/opera, I went here, I saw (blank) star/author/musician, I chased (blank) hot chick\\". On and on. The sheer immensity of his self-indulgence/agrandizement/absorption is staggering. Did I mention narcissism?<br /> It was a relief to finish it and put it back on the shelf. Read Life (Keith Richards' autobiography)if you want to learn about a real rock God.
B003Z6WFWC|4.0|The movie was great, it had intricate sub plots and great consistency. I thought it did a good job of dramatizing the issues and got you to think about the period of the piece.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like it but I had forseen the plot from page 20, so although I enjoyed the reading until the end there was not any suspense anymore, just some curiosity for the details.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|version two improves the graphics and adds some new obstacles. the mine train is really cool. it did freeze up once and require an uninstall and reinstall which kept it from getting five stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Machiavelic. The story starts very well, holds you for a while but my interest kind of faded through the end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this new update to Temple Run, my husband and my two children love this game and play it all the time. We actually try to see who can get the higher score in our home.  Love the graphics on the Retina screen on my son's new IPad, the rest of us are always wanting to use his IPad because the colors on the screen seem like a 3 D effect, it's gorgeous.  Whomever updated the graphics and coloring on this one did a great job, the only thing I do not like is the cart ride, I always get slammed into a tree!  I love this App and would highly recommend it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly seems to always find the story line to move Harry Bosch forward. His character development of Bosch and motivation of the character to solve each new crime truly proves that \\"everyone counts or no one counts\\" in Harry Bosch's world. What a \\"novel\\" concept (pardon my pun)!
B002VWNID6|5.0|I wanted this so bad. You have to flip it.over to play second half. Srill a great deal. Also a really great price and fast shipping
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the weeknd! It is nice to have all of these amazing songs on 3 HQ discs. Every song has plenty of replay value. I'm so glad I finally purchased this.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|Well I was really surprised,thought the movie was  good.Not a Oscar contender,but it was a fun movie to watch.I like action movies and this one is just that.
B000JQUQZO|4.0|I enjoyed reading his outlook on life. He sees things in black and white / right or wrong terms which is refreshing in this ever growing shades of gray world.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I hoped this would be a challenging game of mahjong.  Unfortunately, since I am an adult, I find that is not the case.
B0028ER4QE|5.0|The album arrived in perfect conditions and the audio quality is excellent! So glad to have this in vinyl again!
B000W93CHC|4.0|For Pillars of the Earth fans, this book is Part Two of the story. Perhaps not quite as engaging as volume I, but very enjoyable reading for one interested in the historical setting. Current events in Catholicism and fundamentalist religion are presaged by events in the story, to say nothing of the politics, the legal system, the current &#34;longest&#34; war and &#34;enhanced interrogations&#34; of our own period.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! Currently using the reading plan to read the Bible in one year. It even has a reminder. Search function is a wonderful help with study. I adore the sound function that reads to you.  Best of all,  you can share your notes, and see the notes of others on the scripture you are studying! I hope you enjoy this app as much as I do.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I have a 65&#34; Panny 3D Plasma to watch my movies on.  This one has an outstanding video transfer.  Stunning example of a 3D Blu-Ray!  You'll love it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is absolutely the BEST show on television, or DVD!!  We love the show, the actors, the intrigue, the scenery, etc.  Everywhere we go, when the subject of Downton Abbey comes up, that's all people can talk about, and how much they love it, too!!  Thank you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I had just watched the movie and I wanted to read the book.  Interestingly enough the movie follows the book very closely with a few tid bits extra in the book that readers are sure to enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Even though it's been many years since my teens, I can relate to fitting/not fitting in in High School.<br />The secret at the heart of this novel, though shocking, is not that unusual. Many children are abused<br />by people they know well and whom no one would suspect.<br />The characters are all out-siders who find each other. The wall flower is a good listener and observer.<br />He does need to be shown that he does fit in some where even if it's Rocky Horror Show.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a real fun book. Quick read but also very entertaining. I liked the introduction of all gods I had yet to hear about.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Wow what can I say. I'm a ZZ Topp fan from way back, and LA FUTRA is great. The trio has done it again with some different sound and a spin on the song Flying High-just COOL! It's still ZZ TOPP and you got to have it with your collection. Don't believe I've heard even one of the songs on the radio yet. Gets a 5 from me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book! Love, love, loved it! Ended up buying her two other books! New favorite author for me:)  give this book a whirl
B00187MXNQ|5.0|Wow, what a great album from such a powerhouse team! I heard on SIRIUS XMU recently, and I didn't realize the album was a couple of years old. You got the lead singer from Arctic Monkeys here w/ several other musicians from indie bands. Awesome, fresh sound!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the greatest game ever. Better than when I was a kid I absolutely adore dragon vale!!! It is the best.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching this movie we streamed from Amazon Prime. The movie had a lot of action that kept your attention from the start to finish. I would watch it a second time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is a really fun game and the graphics are awesome.<br />It is way better than Bloons TD 4and the heli pilot is really cool to.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it wont even open. it slows your whole device and it stops and freezes in the middle of a game so you cant play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like how you can get this game on the kindle.  Fancy graphics makes the trees look more realistic and I like how it adds the clouds.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|But not in a dirty way.<br />While there is some very erotic scenes, the story is not all about sex but about the love that allows us to move beyond our hangups and get away from the vices we use as crutches to get through our lives. Great love story and real characters. LOVE this book!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|You get NO cool clock faces with the freebie version. Only a small digital display on the top edge of the screen and the rest of the screen is an ad to upgrade to the paid version. Also, there is NO preview of alarm sounds... Very thoughtless. Technically is IS an alarm clock, so I gave it two stars. But if they think Im gonna upgrade after this lame looksee, they're nuts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|But not in a dirty way.<br />While there is some very erotic scenes, the story is not all about sex but about the love that allows us to move beyond our hangups and get away from the vices we use as crutches to get through our lives. Great love story and real characters. LOVE this book!
B000J2DAYM|2.0|Not worth seeing. The plot is clear and you can guess who the &#34;bad guy&#34; is from the beginning, but I had no idea what they were saying 70% of the time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|But not in a dirty way.<br />While there is some very erotic scenes, the story is not all about sex but about the love that allows us to move beyond our hangups and get away from the vices we use as crutches to get through our lives.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun and very fast sometimes it's hard but then I just becomes easy how I dont but all I know is I love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love solitaire to begin with. Now, when I am waiting for my kids at dance, taekwondo, tutoring, etc...., I can play solitaire on my kindle.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I kept emailing a friend (who faintly resembles the heroine) \\"you have to read this\\"/ \\"No, forget it\\"/ No, do read it\\" etc. etc.--it is so good in some ways and so sloppily cobbled in others I felt, well, see title of my review.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I&#34;ve finished the first book and i was amazed at the story line. Now i see what all the fuss was about. Couldn&#34;t put it down. Can&#34;t wait to start Fifty Shades Darker.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would not even write this bad review if I had not just spent over an hour trying to resolve how to get this problem resolved. I ordered this as a gift for someone out of state, it came with a disc missing and a duplicate disc in it's place. The person received this as a gift and is a collector. To try to get this replaced...even just one disc...has been a nightmare. Because I bought the gift Amazon will only generate a return label to my address which is 3 hours away from this gift, they will not send a return label to the person who received it. Not sure why as the label is needed to get the gift back to Amazon for a replacement. So now I have to get the label to print, if my printer will work, mail it out of state where he will box it up and take it to wherever they can find a UPS drop off and then WAIT for a new item to be sent to replace it. Amazon never used to make this so difficult. I priced this item at Best Buy at the time I was gong to buy it, next time I will choose Best Buy, returns are much easier and my son could have taken it to the one near him and walked out with another one. Amazon I am DISAPPOINTED you sent an incomplete item and then made it so hard to fix your problem.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love authors that fall off the box. This is the case. Using scenarios and situations that we've experienced in other novels where a post apocaliptic world is the base, Suzanne Collins has given an original twist and produced this gem. I've already read the trilogy and It was one of the best investments on reading in the last year. Thanks Suzanne and keep writing!.

086571701X|5.0|If you want to get started with or are experienced with aquaponics, this is the book for you. The information in this book, coupled with a bit of handyman plumbing knowledge is all you need to start your own set up.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I recondition the blade of my Kershaw Ken Onion Blur in a few minutes. Not quite factory sharp, but better than I expected for the effort and price. This little guy fits in your pocket and is very easy to use. Basic instructions on the package.
0880796863|5.0|I received this deck as a gift, and it's served me for two+ years. I decided to pick up a deck for my sister, because she wanted some for Christmas. They're serving her well too. Cards are well-made, and solid.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This can be fun... keeps me &amp; my kiddos entertained. I don't like that tasks are timed. But its fun.
