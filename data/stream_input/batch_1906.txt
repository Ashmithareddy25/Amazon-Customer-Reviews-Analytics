0399250573|5.0|Book in good condition.  In fact, I gave it to my local school library for others to enjoy next. Thank you.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|There are very few people for whom I'd recommend this book, but I personally found Colin to be easy to relate to. Green's An Abundance of Katherine will probably appeal to those who both like teen love stories like Flipped (Wendelin Van Draanen) and Stargirl (Jerry Spinelli), as well as nerdy books like For The Win (Cory Doctorow). The use of coarse language may offend younger readers.
0786958731|5.0|This board game will be easier for those who had played the RPG D&D before, The idea is similar where the heroes(you) goes into the dungeon and battle monsters. A random tile will be selected and added to the board as the Hero explores the \\"dungeon.\\" A new monster will appear with each new tile. It can be challenging if the heroes starts flipping more tiles and made more than one monster appear at a time. You roll on behalf of the monster and yourself in a battle, so if you are bad with dice, then the monster would share your good share of roll too.<br /><br />You will have to pay attention to the powers and items that your Hero has and this could be the like it or hate it thing for people who never played any D&D before. You will have at least 6 cards that you can choose from for your Hero each time it goes into battle and being familiar with them can be hard for new players.<br /><br />Overall, it is a fun game. The random monster and tile that comes up (also curses) adds fun to the game as you can never predict what will happen when you go further into the dungeon.
B009E3EY38|4.0|Why would the set not include a DVD version of the actual concert as well?  The rehearsal is good, but would have liked both options. Why did this take 5 years to be released?
B00APUQH0W|4.0|We watched this movie when our family was home for the holidays. It was great entertainment for everyone, from age 12 to 75. Clint Eastwood is always great. Amy Adams was very good, too.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Disappointing and boring.  If you're interested in what's happening with your favorite characters from the first three books don't look here.  Chapter after chapter of new characters introduced who add nothing to the continuation of the story and GRRM fails miserably in making any of them interesting enough to want to read about.<br />I kept going to other books and coming back to this one in hopes it would get better.  It never did.  The book simply goes nowhere.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much better than spending real money to play this game! I could play it for hours. I can't wait to look for more game like it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  im alil addicted lol. my kids enjoy it. its like I'm in the movie graphics are great.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wish I had the words to describe how much I loved this book. The time it took me to read it was filled with thoughts of \\"just one more chapter, and I'll go to bed.\\" But that of course always was repeated about twelve times before I would finally give in to sleep. The characters burrowed into my heart (especially Sadie, and the jump rope girls) and there were quite a few times my eyes filled with tears.<br /><br />Kudos, Mr. King. This truly is one of my favorite reads of all time.
B003AVMUSG|5.0|A gift that can be passed on to future generations.  It is a classic that tests creativity and fun for both boys and girls/
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Such a page turner. Perfect for those who love a good thrill!<br />Gillian Flynn is an amazing author. Don't miss out!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Don't open the cover if you need some sleep. Fast read, entertaining, and a real page turner. Mystery,bullets and love
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Entertaining story line &amp; great puzzles! I enjoyed it and found some puzzles challenging . Another good one from G5.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Terrible terrible acting, no story line, and terrible acting. This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|All around great story for any age, over 50 and I loved it!  Watched it with my granddaughter who is 13.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I have been a black keys fan for years and when I learned this produced by then, I gave it a listen and find it to be a wonderful cross between their style and that of Dr. John.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Being a true dog lover this story is very touching and heart warming.  It made we start thinking twice when I thought I knew what my pups were trying to say with those very expressive eyebrows.
B0012GMW34|5.0|Atypcial Santana but very much in line with McLaughlin at the time.  I have had the album for years then got the CD.  I got this for an x-mas present for an up and coming guitar enthusiast.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|As a longtime Beatles fan, I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know about my favorite, George Harrison. But this film really opened my eyes to the depth of character of this genuinely gifted, remarkable man. Through images, music, and interviews with those who knew him best, it paints a contextual portrait of George that will make you wish you had been one of his friends.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Downloaded this game twice on my sons nabi and it would not work. The message said that Ice age village quit working. Maybe I will try it again another time.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Okay, I was really shocked I loved this.  But it was great.  I thought it was cast perfectly and I love Ted.  It's silly, funny, romantic, and heartwarming with foul language from a bear all mixed in :)  I will watch this again and again.
B005SCSL56|5.0|Who knew that Chris Colfer had this in him? at first the only reason i bought this book was because it was written by chris colfer. he plays kurt on glee my favorite tv show. so, i started reading it and couldnt put it down. the story was so wonderfully written with very relatable and different characterd. i hope he writes a sequel to this amazing novel.<br />oh and this is not your average fairy tale story. surprise ending!!!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The acting was a bit poor, once you get past that, and being a tech nerd, it was rather interesting to see.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter.  Since opening the gift, she has been watching non stop almost.  She loves it!  Great service through Amazon, quick delivery....happy kid.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was beautifully written and the story kept my attention throughout the entire novel. Mr King has written some incredible novels during his illustrious career and this one is right near the top.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good it will take you a very long time to build up your base. The energy is very trust cos you have to keep having to buy more power plants
B008GFI4KY|4.0|Taking serious cues from the rock gods of the 70's this third album by the British camp brigade known as The Darkness is very much a focussed collection of sonics that aims to hit your hard rock sweetspot. Their first album was basically a gimmick rock pastiche with those joke falsetto vocals that provided some great novelty hits but didn't necessarily point to any hopes of longevity. The second album was, conversely, so obviously created through huge amounts of focus and desire to make every second of its length a perfect 'The Darkness' experience that, regardless of the controversy surrounding its sales figures pointed to a band that could really make a living out of this rock schtick.<br /><br />So after a well publicised hiatus the bands third album provides what? Well, a toning down of the limiting falsetto schmaltz for starters - which is a good thing. Secondly we get another focussed effort. While the band have eschewed the more expansive Queen style references of their second album here they have however cranked up the courting of the 70's hard rock ethos while retaining a lot of their core sound in terms of songwriting and funny bone tickling lyrics. Which means that this is the third album by the band that sounds different.... while still sounding like the same band.<br /><br />Some versions of this album have a range of extra tracks tacked onto the end. I can't claim you are missing a heapin' helpin' by never hearing acoustic demo versions of some of the songs on the album proper though it amused me to hear Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull fame doing is flautist thing on the long version of Cannonball.<br /><br />All up this album sports good production, solid songwriting, amusing lyrical couplets and a more restrained approach to certain aspects of the bands signature sound. The songwriting stays within the milieu of the 70's and the whole release has an upbeat vibe to it. A good album for your car.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Meyer raps this saga up fantastically! Best book ever!<br />The details and words are emotional and raw. This is a highly recommended book for people who like this series!
B00867GHS8|5.0|We have purchased our 1st HD television and went all-the-way by getting a 3D, LED, Samsung 60&#34;.  We decided on this classic as our 1st 3D experience.  Loved it!!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoy point and click adventure games, so I was thrilled to see a new one come out. This one was a lot of fun. I found it challenging enough to make me think, but not impossible enough that I spent more time looking for walkthroughs than playing the game. The in-game hints were done well. They took a 2 layered approach, so if you just needed a nudge you could still solve the puzzle without having the whole thing spelled out for you. I will definitely buy the next game from this developer!<br /><br />But what really made it 5 stars for me was the prompt reply from the developer. On my kindle fire HD, the game would crash whenever I would access the map in either the second or third scenes of the game. I did email the developer, and within an hour on a Sun night on a holiday weekend I had a response. The fix is in and has been uploaded to Amazon and should be available in a few days (for those that have also mentioned this problem in their reviews). For me, it's not that a company has a problem (because problems always will happen!) but how they respond that's important. So I won't have any worries buying from this developer in the future!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have built 2 PC's and use this every time. Never have any thermal issues. I always make sure the top of the CPU is completely covered. You can buy cheaper thermal compounds but if you are going to spend hundreds if not thousands on your build, why risk it?
B004TFZYNK|4.0|I admire Hugh Laurie as an actor. I had read that he is an accomplished musician. I thought this would be nice to collect. I was however disappointed, considering the price, about the size of the book. The description led me to believe it was like a cofee table book. Otherwise if you are a fan of Hugh Laurie its nice to have.
1416594795|2.0|God vs Dawkins? Who will win in the end? Will Dawkins be able to persuade God He doesn't really Exist? Will God lay down His undefeated title as God of the universe? Well, to answer that all one has to do is go to what the final authority in the universe says about ultimate reality. Genesis1:1 `In the beginning GOD created the heavens and the earth....' Well, it seems to me God has the final say and Dawkins is delusional.
0062073486|5.0|Excellent book. There have been a few movie versions. The best being the one with Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Houston. I could see and hear the characters from the movie as I read this book. To me its Christie's best. But to each his/her  own favorite.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow free kills time. I use this app when waiting at the dr.s office.<br />Try to pass each level as fast as you can.
0062073494|3.0|As I said elsewhere I am not a Hercule Poirot fan. I bought it because this was made into a movie. But unlike my experience with Death on the Nile. I could not get into this book. I saw the movie but I could not hear them or see them as I read. It was different.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy read and if you think you have problems.....jeesh. Wacky twist and lovable psycho characters. Two words for ending: What the...? ( in a \\"didn't see that coming\\" kinda way!)
0062073559|5.0|Not really a big hercule Poirot fan. I bought the book because it had been made into a movie. Seeing the movie first really made the different when reading it. I saw and heard all the characters from the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was well written and kept me interested the whole time  surprise ending too and you just want to finish it as fast as you can! Read this book

B004FRX0MY|4.0|Choosing the right \\"cloud\\" solution for my music collection was a journey of trial and error. The complication arose out of my cross platform use.  I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go.  If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store.  I buy my music from Amazon.<br /><br />Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device.  The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.<br /><br />itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.  I highly recommend Amazon's Solution.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good trilogy, but very bad ending, no matter what it seemed that katniss world will be a dark one. Filled with traumas and fears. Seems to me that snow got the last laugh. Very anti climatic...
B007X4ECMI|5.0|It was a very good movie.  Non stop action.  It is a movie I would watch more than once.  Movie did not come with a case though.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think the first book and the last book better but you have to read them all to make sense. Overall it was a great book.

B000FC146C|5.0|I read this many years ago and decided to rediscover it.  Such an interesting cast of characters and the descriptions of the landscape are compelling.  Definitely worth a second read!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Have used Merriam Webster all my life. Great reference to have handy on my Kindle for reading books as well as when typing sermons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game! One is trying to earn enough coins to get Elf Tricky. But, does anyone know if they will keep this character after the limited time Christmas theme ends? She may not try to earn if it is only gets that character for a day or two.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm going to love this new season. I so much enjoyed the other 2 and have watched them more than once.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I read the reviews between the G13 and the Nostromo and decided that I would try the Nostromo instead of the Logitech, but after 2 weeks of use, I decided to give the Logitech a try.  The G13 was better in every dimension that counts to me.<br /><br />1) The Logitech software is better.  The Logitech software allows you to label your commands so instead of having to do a two level translation (from gamepad to keyboard and from keyboard to action), you can see what action you are assigning to which key on the gamepad directly.  The set up was MUCH easier because of this.<br /><br />2) Logitech Joystick is better.  The Nostromo joystick was difficult to use.  I found that I had to move my thumb off of it in order to change directions that I was moving.  The G13's joystick is easier to use.<br /><br />3) Logitech is move stable.  The Nostromo would rock back and forth and slide around my desk.  I found myself taking my pinky off my the keys and using it to hold the gamepad in place.  The G13 does not move on my desk.<br /><br />4) The backlighting on the G13 was better.  The Nostromo backlighting does not shine through the key itself, but shines around the key.  So in the dark, you can see WHERE the keys are, but not WHICH key you are pressing.  The Logitech backlighting shines through the key so that you can identify the key.<br /><br />So perhaps I am not hardcore enough of a gamer, but the clear choice to me is the Logitech.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Brave was an outstanding movie. The quality of the animation done by PIXAR gets better and better every year. This movie was not short on quality. The sound and pictures were simply amazing. There were times during the movie I wanted to say, \\"Wow... isn't the scenery beautiful?\\"<br /><br />The plot of the movie was good, and it was nice to have a heroine take the lead role. In addition, the movie was hilarious! There were so many funny parts. Although a Disney movie, there were quite a few scary parts that young children would find frightening.<br /><br />The major downside (and the reason it's only 4 stars) to this 3-disc Blu-ray set was the special features. I was very interested in the Scottish accents and the actors that did the voices (they were all native Scotts), but the special feature on them was only a few minutes long. The rest of the special features were not much better. With a separate blu-ray disk dedicated to the features, I was expecting a lot more.<br /><br />In all, I was quite pleased with it, and definitely recommend it.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|Highly addictive and fun Shark dash is a time consuming distraction. Amazing visuals and fun replay value. Well worth the buy
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I think this is Nassim,s best book yet. It is much more accessible to the average reader: despite the fact that some sections very technical in nature. Buy it.
014241722X|2.0|Grisham should stick to adult thrillers. It ended without an end, in the worst kind of way. Like a TV show that says \\"to be continued\\" and leaves every single storyline hanging. Sadly, even that is not enough to get me to pick up the next one I just don't care what happens.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The added changes and up grades are great!  Seeing the old stuff on Blu-ray is beyond belief.  If you were ever a fan, this is worth the investment.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was romantic full of action and adventure. Pulling you into the games making become one with Katniss. It makes you see the games from her view, how she got there from her prospective. Falling in love with Petta the way she did was so engaging making you want to cry at the end when she says she has to let his hand go not really knowing when they will be together . I guess I will have to find out in book two and three if they come through or if Katniss goes to Gale.
1594487154|5.0|You probably don't consider yourself a salesperson and you might not even like \\"sales\\" or salespeople, but as Dan Pink points out, 80-90% of us \\"sell\\" every day - even stay at home parents! Whether it's our jobs (about 1 in 10) or its part of the daily persuasion almost all of us engage in (about 8 in 10) with co-workers, bosses, clients, parents, spouses, children, neighbors, etc. we all sell! Dan Pink has done it again, he's hit on a topic that is at once universal, deeply important and right on time: how in the 21st Century, when everyone has access to so much information about any person or organization, do we \\"move\\" others to mutually valuable outcomes? I read this book quickly the first time and am about to start it again. The examples and exercises are especially valuable for anyone who wants to learn how to influence others in ethical ways that create win-win outcomes. Really, the book is about communicating - especially listening so that you can identify the other person's challenges or problems before jumping to solutions. Pink not only describes how \\"sales\\" are different today than a decade ago, he helps the reader understand how \\"moving\\" others first requires an understanding of their perspective. Like everything else, one size no longer fits all. \\"To Sell is Human\\" might turn traditional sales thinking on its head, at the very least, it will help all of us - salespeople, negotiators, persuaders or parents - arrive at solutions that serve all parties better and therefore achieve longer-term buy-in while strengthening relationships.
B003NX75B8|2.0|This was a really quick read. Enjoyable, but very simplistic. The characters weren't very complex, and neither was the overall plot. However, for a quick and easy read, it's good enough.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Zeptolab does it again!!<br /><br /> You play as cute little one eyed jello PUDDING things. Alone you are weak and the humans are going to eat you but together you become quite gross actually. Your one eyed blob joins another then another turning you into a larger blob with little hats and mustaches and buttons and eyes all over. Honestly no one will want to eat them then.<br /><br />Anyway, the goal is to unite them as one. Getting them together is fairly easy. Collecting the stars (which you have to land on, not pass through) can be quite challenging. Each level gradually gets a little more difficult at either collecting or connecting the little...puddings<br /><br />It gets easier when for a level whenever they teach you something new like a new PUDDING or method of connecting or some sort of contraption that helps you out. That keeps you from flying off the screen. P.S. they don't stop unless they hit another PUDDING or wall or some sort of solid object. Towards the end is hardest. When you have to connect the eye to the blobs and then connect them.<br /><br />All together though it is a really fun game for most ages. Like older kids to adults. It requires some serious thought on some levels.. I definitely recommend this. It works great on the kindle fire is. No crashing, freezing or blips of any kind. Plus you can't beat the price. Oh and one more thing. This is the whole game not a pain in the but demo that you have to buy to finish. It's fun, free and you'll love it.<br /><br />(honestly they are more like like jellos than PUDDING. The kind you put in molds and make rainbows and put little fruits in and no one really wants any but it's pretty so everyone makes one and then you have all this stuff than nobody wants but it's okay because it only cost you like $3.00. That's why you made it in the first place. Because you didn't want to spend a lot. That's what they are like. Jello. Not PUDDING.<br /><br />I don't know why my spell checker keeps capitalizing PUDDING. It doesn't  do that when I write puddings. PUDDING is good! Puddings, not as much. Hello isn't even a word apparently. Whenever I type jello<br />unless I correct it it types hello. Unlike PUDDING!! Which it cap locks.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|I finally got a copy of this set so I can write an actual review. I find many reviews on Amazon are negative because of item availability and aftermarket pricing. So here is an actual review of the set, not the market. Please see the customer image gallery for my build uploads.<br /><br />Design: This set uses a modular design. If you follow the instructions, you get eight distinct modules, four above ground and four below ground. You can arrange these in dozens of different ways to create tiny cave networks and a multi-layered effect. The caves have several different kinds of hidden resources that you can only see when you take the top layer off. The overall effect of the design is a pretty good representation of the Minecraft world.<br /><br />Build Quality: Pretty solid, I'm happy to say. This set does not sacrifice build quality for detail (which many LEGO sets unfortunately do). You may find that the tree tops pop off when you're rearranging the different modules, but everything else sticks solid.<br /><br />Fun Factor: This was a really fun build. Because it is a microworld, you can easily tell what each piece represents as you are clicking them into place. Once complete, it's really fun to create different arrangements with the modules. Even with just eight modules, you have quite a few options. I hope I can get a second one to customize the microworld even further.<br /><br />Value: I was happy to pay $34.99 for this set. For Minecraft fans, I don't think you'll be disappointed. For Minecraft/LEGO fans, it's simply a must-have. You get 408 pieces, which is about $0.085 per piece. For a licensed set, that's actually below average. Of course, that's probably because it relies so heavily on 1x1 tiles and plates. Still, you get eight 6x6 plates, quite a few bricks, and a brick separator. I thought the brick separator was a nice touch for separating all the tiny plates. There are only three exclusive pieces for the Steve and creeper heads. You get an extra Steve head, so if you add a red brick (or whatever color you want), you can make a second adventurer. To piece this set together on BrickLink dot com would cost about $50-$60.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you can get it for MSRP of $34.99, it's a buy. I wouldn't suggest paying collectible prices, as LEGO will undoubtedly be producing more of these, and will probably create different Minecraft sets in the near future. At least I hope they do. I would love to add more modules to this set, and I'll be interested to see tiny zombies, skeletons, and mob animals.<br /><br />A note on aftermarket sales: This set is incredibly popular. I imagine that LEGO was surprised by the demand. The aftermarket prices have come down to ~$60, which is still way to high. But that is how a collector's market works. Lots of people on here are rating the set low because they paid 2-3 times retail for it, which is the buyer's fault as much as the seller's. Many people are also upset with the behavior of sellers who list these sets at high prices, which seems really weird to me. It seems like buyers who are willing to pay those prices should be happy for the fact that the sets are available at all. Buyers that pay that much and then get bent out of shape about it need to look to themselves. Prices go up on collectibles like this because enough buyers are willing to pay for it, simple supply and demand. If you or your kid is wanting this set, just sit tight. There will be more available at retail price soon. If not, just get some LEGO bricks in Minecraft colors and make your own. You'll be a lot happier.<br /><br />ehead, so if you add a red brick (or whatever color you want), you can make a second adventurer.

030758836X|1.0|I just purchased this book on the recommendation of &#34;The Week&#34;.  I'm only on the fourth chapter, but I'm hating it.  It is so poorly written, I am gritting my teeth - literally.  The author either is incapable of literary writing, or is too preoccupied with hipness and gimmicks to write well.  (Amy is a quiz-writer who wants to be a real writer, so each chapter told from her point of view is a diary entry in which she is supposedly honing her writing skills, yet she can't help including a quiz - really???)  If &#34;The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo&#34; gets a B- for literariness, this book gets a D.  I can sometimes get past poorly written suspense if the plot is sharp, but judging from the other reviews, the plot is very weak.
B000B8QF14|5.0|This CD offers so many interesting and original music that is sure to be rock classics. Buy it today and enjoy!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Could not put down! Really enjoyed this book in the series , I will definitely read the next one unexpected  it to be as great
B003O85W3A|5.0|My son is very pleased with this album and the sound quality is excellent. Buy it today for your listening pleasure.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|one of his best cd's was worth the money only brought it for one song but I like the whole cd
B000FC13E0|4.0|This is not the most mentally stimulating read ever - I was not very attached to the characters and it didn't blow my mind. However, it is an excellent way to pass time on an airplane or the beach. I'd much rather read this than watch tv. I didn't regret the purchase.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I brought it for the New York song but I found that the whole CD was very entertaining worth the money
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I purchased because I want to see the film, but I'd rather read it first. It took a bit for me to become invested in the story, but it is beautifully written and full of vivid imagery. I like the story and  that the book makes the reader consider how his or her own perceptions affect our own lives. I was sad when the book was over to close it and leave the characters behind.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I love Linkin Park but this was the only CD that did not have any of the songs played on the radio, but still as good
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|There were definitely funny moments in this movie but I'm glad I waited for it to come out on rental instead of seeing it in the theatures.  I have a friend that absolutely loved it but most people I talk to feel the same way I do - a few laugh out loud moments with a cheesy &#34;feel-good&#34; ending.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|music you have to be in the mood for it, nothing on the radio but the sound is still good
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Great app.  Have had a ton of fun editing pictures.  Unfortunately the post to FB and email options don't seem to work for me so I have to text the edited pic to myself and then post it to FB or email it to myself via the text.  Otherwise - lots of fun.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I only brought it for one song but found the whole CD to be relaxing and smooth music making it worth the money
B007VUCAVO|5.0|To know the actual status of your battery on an electronic device that you actually rely on regularly, to me is well worth $2.00. This app does exactly that and, just in case, even more.<br /><br />It certainly beats the tiny battery icon that comes with the Kindle Fire. And this, as with many other similar situations, begs the question of why not charge two bucks more for the tablet and put it on.<br /><br />This is a PC, for all intents and purposes, Google ought to outsmart Apple by coming up with a more comprehensive O.S. and they would still be cheaper than an iPad. Even if adding this battery app...And remember, it's a Battery App; not some program to take you to Mars. Yes, there may be other good ones and for a dime less. My point is simply that we should not have to buy one. This is plenty good and should be part of the of O.S.<br /><br />Update: I just purchsed a Samsung Note II Andrid phone, and this was the first app I bought. I use it and as a result have yet to find myself with a dead battery on a phone that reminds me more of a tblet and it is mavelously loaded,
B00004Z459|4.0|I am a fan so all there music is worth  the money This is not as good as the others but still good
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead started me on a zombie craze that I have no interest in quitting!  First it was the show then I got my kindle fire which led to a zombie book fettish that doesn't seem to want to end.  This show was created from comic books.  I am not a comic book lover nor have I ever been interested in any form of sci -fi, so I find it a little odd that I am so hooked on this series.  It is just so well written, and so extremely well acted that you could actually see yourself living in this zombie apocalypse.  The writers are very bold, they are not afraid to kill off a main character or to turn a good guy bad.  You just never know what is going to happen and that is part of what keeps me hooked.  I don't see how anyone could watch an episode or two of this series, this is one of those shows that people arrange their day around, thankfully it comes on late in the day and if somehow I miss it I make sure I can download it.<br />On an extra note I think it is going to show in full as a marithon on New Years!!!  Yeah!!!
B000002MX7|5.0|I always liked Chaka Khan but I never liked all her CD's but this you only get the hits, making it worth the money
1616960922|4.0|I don't know if the shorter (about a quarter as long as his others) format made a difference for the development, but it wasn't as good as the previous novels of his I have read.  I still enjoyed it but something felt lacking.
B004FOA84A|2.0|at first it was fun but then it got kind of boring. I didn't really like the game. it should be free!  :(
B0086700CM|5.0|once I started playing it I never stopped. it has a little thing I don't like its the ads that pop up. but its a very fun game.I play every day on it.
0756686970|5.0|I ordered this for my Grandson who is absolutely nuts over both Star Wars and Lego's.  This was perfect book for him.  He opened it Christmas morning and loved it.  That made Grandma's morning.  It arrived quickly after I ordered it and is a good sturdy book that will hold up for him and his younger brothers.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I liked the look of this cover as soon as I saw it, and I was not disappointed when I received it.<br />I've had it for over a year now and it has traveled the world without any issues. It still holds my Fire snug and looks great. I'm still getting complements on it and when it's not in use it looks like a leather bound book on my coffee table.<br />The microfiber liner is soft and easy to clean, and the leather-look-a-like material the cover is made out of looks fabulous and holds up great. Although the inside pocket only comfortably holds a small stack of folded paper, it's adequate.<br />If this one ever wears out, and I'm not sure it will, I'll be buying another one just like it. It's a pleasure to use and look at. I would highly reccommend it to anyone that likes the look of a hardback leather book, but the convenience and technology of the present.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I just received my Kindle for my birthday/Christmas gift so I definitely had to add Facebook to my APPS!<br />&#62;
B008NB0SQO|3.0|Again, I purchased this for the picture quality as we have been watching a DVD recorded from the original VHS tape. The original is dark, but acceptable. The only problem I have is the missing song, &#34;When Love is Gone&#34;. A stupid idea to have it cut.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Bought this the same time I ordered my Kindle Fire.  I read the reviews and picked this one.  Love the color although it is not as bright as the picture (purple).  It is more of a dark purple but its okay.  Seems to be sturdy enough to protect my Kindle and I like that it snaps in.  I think I made the good choice.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My son and I have battled this thing for a while. Provides hours of frustration and also avoids the computer.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I wish it were free. But it's so worth 99 cents! I love to play this game! Who ever made this game is a really smart person.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Starts slow, but starts to become kindle interesting. I can't wait to read the third book if the hunger games!
B000A59PMO|5.0|currently on a veronica mars kick...wish there were more than 3 seasons, but the first season is my favorite!  s
B002ZG976U|5.0|The movie is such an awesomely, great movie. Christina has an amazing voice and it's a fun movie. The product was in good condition.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|The cord indicators move either too slow in Beginner Mode or too fast in Apprentice Mode. I don't even venture to try expert!!! Got it mostly for my 7 year old granddaughter, she gave up after 2 tries and asked if we could find something else. It would be nice if you could just play melodies on your own, but it's the  programmed songs or nothing. Will most likely delete.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Realistic storyline. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep VERY believable. My sister and I watched this and discussed the parallels in our own relationships. Could be a great conversation starter if you could actually get a man to watch it. Better chances to watch as a rental. It did inspire hope for exploring reconnection with a spouse and bringing back the spark.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was transfixed!  The best I've seen on TV in years!  I was glued to my TV!  I even had my meals there!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|a very original game, excellent graphics, a great soundtrack, superb playability, all you need a PERFECT GAME, and for all ages, kids and adults
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game.  its a ton of fun and hard to put down.  the tilt controls are so easy l.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so in love with this book. I found this book through a recommendation and I am so glad I did. My heart fell in love with Sky and Holder and it also broke with Sky and Holder. I will recommend this book to everyone!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a fantastic book. Loved every page of it. Couldn't put it down. It made you happy and it made me cry at times. A must read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Difficult enough to make you want to cheat but you can finish without doing so.  Worked great on my original kindle fire.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This product was excellent, It gets stored in my amazon account, meaning I can access it from anywhere! I absolutely love this show and it played with no issue whatsoever!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so fun but it takes a long time and its hard to get coins
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved all of the twists and turns ans how it all came together.  5 stars all the way!  Movie, please!
B001NB545Q|5.0|Even if you are just a casual listener of the Who, this will not disappoint.  There aren't any track skippers on this one-
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great Show, Great Actors, Great Service! Nice to see more of Claire Dane...she's a great actress!  Storyline keeps you wanting more!
B0014EVO4M|5.0|Eddie is always surprising me with his ability to create.  These are moving and inspirational songs.  If you love this, check out his Ukelele album...awesome!
B005AERS74|3.0|Not the worst, not the best but good for a lazy day. What were you going to do anyhow? Yep, it's good for that.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show!  Our friends persistently strongly encouraged us to watch this series and we heard many many great things about this show before watching it so we began with very high expectations. We were not disappointed.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love this app.  I find that having the ability to work from my cell phone is so important in today's business world. Office Suite allows me to take my documents with me and work on them from anywhere.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For every beautiful girl like Sky, I wish a beautiful boy like Dean Holder.<br /><br />Beautiful, sweet, pure, heart warming, heart wrenching, and inspiring. I loved this novel.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|This was as offered..Good service and good product..The person has watched all of them and was very satisfied with the quality..
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this in just three days. Might seem like a long time but as a mom of two small children it's hard to find the time.I just couldn't put it down.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Easy to use......I use it constantly.  It was a fast download....and a quick, accurate resource. I Would load it again.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|this was a christmas gift.  my daughter was so excited to get this ultimate collection along with the others that she received.  It's hp for goodness sakes.  who wouldn't like it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|need offline version when you are not near WiFi  live in rural area well I hope you fix this issue
B001L83PLQ|5.0|The story alone is very compelling and moving. The fact that it is based on true events makes Half a Yellow Sun that much more gripping. I was a child when Biafra was being formed and never really understood what caused the war. I only knew about the starving children.  Adichie gives us a compelling history lesson as well as a profound view of the resilience of people.  There are examples of both powerful compassion and also inhumanity.  Although you can't know how the story ends until you get to the end of the book,  it is sad that you can't change how  the actual events ended.
B0081J9OWC|4.0|This sophomore effort is solid. The tunes may not be as immediately catchy as several track off Up from Below, but the album as a whole is immensely listenable, and I've enjoyed it more each time I revisit it. Recommended!
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I can't get the game to work right and am getting frustrated with it. When I pick my icon and hit OK it does nothing.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|I discovered David Garrett on a special PBS broadcast.  PBS has brought many entertainments to America during their fundraisers.  Of course I didn't want to contribute $120 to get the DVD (I am already a member) so I went to Amazon and there it was.  The DVD and the CD so I purchased both.<br /><br />He is a fantastic violinist and performs with a huge orchestra and his playing and arrangements are something new.  It is fast paced and nothing like symphonic music (which I love) and is really a new and thrilling sound.  You won't be disapointed if you like fast-paced exciting music.
B003719GGS|3.0|I rented the wrong edition. I'm sorry It was. My first time. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS BOOK please.
0780619587|5.0|Portrays the tragedy of physical abuse combined with over expectation on human beings. The resurrection of a human soul is awe inspiring. One of my favorites. Purchased for a friend with somewhat similar experiences.
B0010OIN90|5.0|One of the biggest hits of the holiday seaston.....My grandson put it together in no time and loved it. He took it off only when he went to sleep and it was back on his wrist as soon as he woke up.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this show. At first i was not in to it, but as time went on i started to like it.  Wish it moved faster, but then again, the plot needs to be set.  Great Zombie series.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I'm a serious lover of the Bourne thriller movies. Santa brought us the The Bourne Legacy DVD, and we watched it tonight. I gotta say...WOW! I mean...just...WOW! Fantastic plot. Loved it! Talk about holding your interest from scene one to the final act. It was perfection.
B009GENZ12|4.0|Loved the suspense, but i need to watch it again to figure out the plot.  When it ended i was confused.  It seems very close to the Movie &#34;The Village&#34;
B004QX07G4|4.0|Great read. Funny just like Ellen. Flowing free style thoughts are when she is at her best. I would definitely recommend it.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Love this movie glad to collect it was good to watch with the whole family can't wat to get more Disney
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie keeps you on the threshold of drawing you in and having some fun but it never happens for some reason. It miss's the mark and I can't tell you why other than it just jumps around so much and so...SO....many things happen that can't really happen that way.<br /><br />It's neither comic book or anywhere near the way things would actually go down. The voices are horrible throughout the film. Batman's voice is terrible and irritating, as well as the voice of Bane never ever came close to fitting.<br /> I liked the parts about taking back from the rich crooks and making the playing field even for a while again but truthfully, the movie never hit the mark for me as a story. Good affects and pretty good action though. Hand to hand fight scenes with all characters were terrible. Just terrible how bad cat woman's were as well as Batman's. YOu can actually see the misses as they play with each other and look so fake and phony.<br />Anyhow....Like I said a pretty good film but no where near a great film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  I never thought in a million years I would be interested in such a genre.  This show keeps you on the edge of your seat and each episode ends in a cliff hanger.  The writing and the acting a great.  Rick Grimes is the man.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down!! I love it! This book was very time consuming and addicting ! I can't wait to read the other books
B005FISBTO|5.0|I'll start of with .... OMFD! MUTHER OF F. SOB. Cliff hanger! Yes, showtimes did something stupid to put the ending snip of the season in that mandatory advertising for showtime.... -_- really showtimes? really. Dexter season 6 is necessary as a setup for season 7 and the grand finally of season 8. It reminds me of season 1. The master piece of Dexter is slowing gaining back it's reign, and season 7 will be good. I can feel it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First off, I watch movies to be entertained and tune out the outside world, which is why i gave this 5 stars.  Lots of action and a fun ride throughout the whole movie.  If you want a deep emotionally story with lots of character development pass on this.  But if you want to watch stuff get blown up, this is a must have movie.
B000GBEWHA|1.0|Every time there was a musical number, it sounded as though the singer had a bucket over there heads.  Unfortunately, this was given as a gift and the cost of sending it back to me and then returning it to the shipper is not cost effective.  I would not recommend this provider to anyone.
B002ZG9774|4.0|Not the best acting in the world, but my wife is a huge fan of Christina Aguilera which is why she likes it.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I thought this was an amazing book.I will recommend it to anyone that asks for a good book to read.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Bob Marley is still alive and well deep in my soul.  I get &#34;positive vibrations&#34; every time I listem to his music.
030746363X|3.0|I feel this book was hyped a bit and promises a little more than it delivers.  It is like a list of personal experiences with his own results.  Some of it was right on target and some was a little out there.  I'm sure you can find something beneficial for everyone, and it was interesting, but I did not take anything residual away from the read.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a very creative and fun game. Has a very silly and interesting concept. Definitely one of the better android games I have played so far.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I especially enjoyed learning that these pilots have honour on combat. The lone we shoot for the planes not the pilots had to be one of my favourites.  Seeing how the war really was in this book was great!
B008OTTRXU|5.0|If you love &#34;call me maybe&#34; you should like this cd. She has a beautiful voice and every song shows it. She has the  pop girl sound similar to many of the girls in the past decade such as avril levigne, pink, beyonce, and the not as successful hilary duff, selena gomez, and the disney and nik girls.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well this is the best game ever but it really needs music and sounds.Otherwise I &hearts; this game!<br />  A lot. Hope you love this game!
B004UID2LC|1.0|This is the worse YouTube app every made, you can't sign into your profile and it's badly made and hard to figure out. It looks like the didn't even try to develop this app. It honestly doesn't deserve a star.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was an okay book. I don't like how neither of the characters ever seemed sure of anything until literally the last page. Even though there were some things I didn't like, there were also many things I did like. I liked how Mira Lyn Kelly writes. I like her style how she leaves out nothing and has no barriers to hold her back. I do think that Connor was quite annoying at times.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game. The unlockable characters are bogus. I hope that the makers consider make these characters worth our time in the future.
0062101897|5.0|This book is great for any Harry Potter fan!! Great pictures  and posters! It has a lot of fun facts and information.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|I loved it. It was very entertaining ,very emotional , uplifting I would recommend this film to the masses. Great
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  He has the whole set and we enjoyed watching it on Christmas day.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|First time was not so sure because I loved the first album so much.<br />However by second listen was addicted !<br />Get it ! He rocks ! Glyn
B004X8W4A4|5.0|My daughter-in-law had the first book they put out and when I saw this, I just had to get it for her.  She was so surprised and thrilled to get it.  She said she didn't know they had put out any more after the first one.  I'm looking forward to reading it after she has.
B001T6PXFG|4.0|We don't get enough movies that highlight people who make a positive difference.  This movie is entertaining and has the elements of a good movie-intrigue, suspense, etc.  it also has a great message.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|Great service and excellent product. Shipped on time and bluray DVD quality was perfect. I recommend this product to anyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I fell in love with the characters right off the bat.  I'm so very  sad it is over and will definitely read it again. I loved it!
B0083Z614S|4.0|Good book to purify your soul. Very delightful reading experience. A happy journey to go together with the children through the garden.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very addictive. highly recommend! I didn't want to put it down. even my 5 year old was enjoying the games. one of the good free games out there.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I've down load many kids Apps for my daughter but this is the one she is always using .... It's colorful and keeps her drawing for hours
B001JIFYSA|2.0|This movie was recommended by a coworker as a great little Christmas movie to watch every year. We're not big movie watchers so we enjoy finding good movies to watch if we're going to watch one (even if we are ten years behind). With all the big name stars in this one, we thought that it had to be pretty good, so we took the recommendation and rented it.<br /><br />We were very disappointed. The very loosely- connected stories were so transparently just a way to get that many big name stars in one movie during their high popularity era without having any one billed higher than another that it made you wonder why the writer didn't just make more movies out of the best of the subplots. Then the subplots...many were blatantly meaningless excuses to get the highly-rated actors into the movie, and added so little to the overall picture or the main plot that they were distracting from the few subplots that did have some depth. And depth seems to be the thing the movie lacked the most of... It was mostly a lot of good actors doing a good job of portraying their typical \\"movie self\\" in an otherwise weak movie. And while British movies often are laced with enough British humour to keep you chuckling, this movie had so little of that that you quit waiting for it. Add gratuitous nudity and bad language just to try to keep the watcher's attention because there's no other reason to watch this or that particular scene, and this pretty well sums up the two-plus hour long movie. If you just wanted to see some of your favorite actors/actresses all in one movie, here ya go.
0446580848|2.0|I didn't think this book was up to DeMille standards.  The book was over 800 pages and probably could have covered all it should in about 300 pages.  Won't read anything by DeMille for a while.  Very disappointed.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Definitely recommend! We were looking to upgrade since one of them had died on us in DVD format! Loved the additional booklet! This box set definitely met our expectations.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I played this game a lot when I first got it. When I tried to exit the game I ran into the first problem. There is no proper way to leave the game. And when I came back I found out that the game didn't save most of my progress, which was really frustrating. And when I started building things in the game, the amount of time it takes to build something also got me frustrated. You shouldn't have to wait 8+ hours for things to build. I am asking Gameloft to fix these issues so no one else stops playing the game like I did.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Probably not of interest to a younger audience, I find this movie about a group retirees to be very well done.  I like the movie far better than the book!
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I absolutely love this cd and all of Avril Lavigne's music. The disc was in brand new condition when I recieved it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Easy to play! A lot of fun! It took me while to remember how to play. Totally worth the dollar!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Ever since ...&#34;Red October&#34; I have been a TOm Clancy fan.  Later, there for a while I seemed to have lost interest in his later books, but it seems as if he is back in the &#34;groove&#34;.  This book seemes to have the same thrill and suspense of his original writings.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome. you should totally buy this game it is so much fun you would love it. Buy it

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a very good book and can really inspire people to do things they may never think of doing
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is my favorite movie can't wait till the new comes out in January 2013, so glad I found it on Amazon my last one got stolen by my cousin and I was without the motivation for Weeks in the gym
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I think many people had overly high expectations of this. It was enjoyable, and I hope the franchise continues, with or without Damon.
B007PZ2BEG|5.0|Fast action, unsuspected surprises in the fights. Around every corner you never knew what you'd run into.  A must see for those like action movies.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I won't be able to say anything new here so I won't try but this movie is a must see every Christmas.

It teaches us not only how to recognize if we are having a stroke, more importantly it taught us how to treat and HELP people who have suffered with a stroke.  Dr Jill is a brave, strong and amazing woman.  I am so glad she shared her story with us all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome...Amazing....loved it...I finished the whole trilogy in less than two weeks...can't wait to see what they do with the movies
0316228532|4.0|Nasty, self-absorbed, petty people living in small-town England.  Ms. Rowling seems to have done what she set out to do:  prove that she is not only a great writer of young adult literature, but also a talented writer for a more mature audience.  The writing is excellent.  Her way of creating a sensation of the smallness of Pagford by having one character's vignette segue into another's was very well done.  My only criticism is that each time she wrote about a character's baser behaviors it was though she was trying to show how un-Harry Potter she could be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing trilogy...I finished them all in less than two weeks...I don't know what I'm going to do now...waiting for the movies
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Without a doubt this book was one I did not want to put down. The author skillfully weaves an air of suspense that keeps you guessing along with extremely descriptive writing that allows you to imagine the costume and scenery of all time periods in the book. The story tells of a granddaughter attempting to solve the mystery of her lineage. It jumps between three time periods but manages to flow smoothly. Along with the reading guide in the back it evoked a great discussion for our Book Club.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love the story lines and how they all interplay among the episodes yet stand alone in case you miss one.  You aren't ever lost.  Didn't think i'd like watching on the computer but it was really great experience.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have always enjoyed these books by Mr.Clancy. He is a great writer and also does a good job of current events.  Cannot wait for more.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|Book is pretty solid from an IT perspective and has fairly good suspense.  The plot is very predictable and has a bit too much love subplot.  There's a quite a long build up before the plot unfolds and becomes interesting.  Overall it held my interest and I'm not much of a fiction reader, so I have 4 out of 5.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great movie! Wish I' d seen it sooner. Watched it with my grandkids and we all couldn't' t stop laughing.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|A movie with an unusual twist. The title is perfect for the movie. It makes you think about who are the savages in the movie.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I don't Skype so camera is worthless. You can only take pictures of yourself. Only teenagers do that and not the general public
1419705849|4.0|She started reading it almost immediately after the presents were unwrapped.  I asked her if she was enjoying it.. she was.  I'll be getting more of this Series for her.
1401322786|5.0|A deeply moving book, as is all of Album's with some perspectives that will make you gasp at the truth of it (like &#34;The Shack&#34;).
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie!!!! A good movie for &#34;the girls&#34; and music lovers. Would watch it again and again.!!  If you liked GLEE you  will love this.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Brings the book to life in a very scary way. This is well produced, directed, acted and it's a story to watch and share with others.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I take my Kindle to church with me every Sunday because this App is so simple to use and convenient, love it!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A person would think that the last book in a series would tie everything up with a nice little bow.<br />Not so fast...the ending left the door open for a).  a continuation or b). letting you imagination take over.<br />I liked the ending of the book it held surprises to the very end.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Jewels Star is addictive!  I play it till the battery in my Kindle dies!  There are some great graphics and animations.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Good life lessons.  Good thought process.  The Secret has always been around but I've never seen it put in words before.  Loved it.  Inspirational and DOABLE.  A go to book.  Positive and hopeful essays.
0764141201|4.0|I like it it is really a Phrasal Verb treasure chest but I don't like the layout too much it is not easy to read. I use bits and pieces of it for my exercises
B006M3JVD6|4.0|Very interesting reading, storyline went into great depth of Jaycee's life whilst held captive.  Would recommend this book to everyone
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very well made game. I just stayed up waaaaay too late trying to destroy humanity in different ways. If you like strategy games, this is a must have game.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Bought this for my Mom who is a Big Fan !  She loved it.  If you like Rod Stewart, you'll enjoy it too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Sooo disappointed in Nick. He was human, made mistakes but should have chosen a better life. So many twists and turns in this book. Real love/hate feeling about it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather channel, nice to have when you need it.  Stupid to have to complete a word count on a review
B004J4WV3C|5.0|These are without a doubt the best running shoes I have ever had.  They are light and protect my heels and legs
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|You will be blown away by the vocals and their choice of music spans all ages. Not just for the. Teens.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|While I appreciated the special effects, the change in plot left me wanting a true remake rather than an homage.
0385528752|4.0|As a mother who tries to screen everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I usually pick out books I think said daughter would enjoy before reading them and then passing them on once they pass muster. In the case of \\"Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard\\" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, though, said daughter had the benefit of *Daddy* screening it before requiring her to read the book. :-) Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\" 'Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard' by Chip Heath and Dan Heath was actually pretty interesting, for a book that has exactly zero dragons, magical wizards, crazy Greek gods, or even the occasional hobbit.<br /><br />\\"Basically, the book tells you how to change things in your life, from changing something in your job to making your new diet stick. In order to change things in your life, you must appeal to both your logical side of the brain (the Rider) and your more emotional side of the brain (the Elephant). The Rider sits on top of the Elephant, and has to control it. Unfortunately, it can be a bit difficult trying to control a gazillion-pound elephant 24/7. That's probably why we often intend to have *just one brownie* and end up gobbling up a whole batch: the Elephant rebels and takes charge. However, you *can* control your personal Elephant - by, in a sense, bribing it. That's what happens when you end up raising $10,000 for people hit by a freak hurricane: your Rider has persuaded your Elephant to go onto that particular road, and with the usual enthusiasm of an actual Elephant, it does.<br /><br />\\"I would probably give this book four stars: two stars for the plot, and two stars for the writing, which showed that the authors have *some* sense of humor - even if they inhabit a world devoid of dragons and hobbits.\\"
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a Scientist, and this book was very eye opening.<br />The author did a great job with the biblical and scientific presentation.<br />This book should be read by anyone who does not believe in GOD.<br />This book will change your life.
0345472322|3.0|As a mother who tries to screen everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I usually pick out books I think said daughter would enjoy before reading them and then passing them on once they pass muster. In the case of \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\\" by Carol Dweck, though, said daughter had the benefit of *Daddy* screening it before requiring her to read the book. :-) Of course, Mummy me already knew everything written in the book ...!!!! In fact, I could have written it myself, right?! I think said child would have enjoyed this book more had it not come so close on the heels of \\"Switch\\" and \\"Make it Stick\\" by Chip and Dan Heath. Ah, to be a child in our family ... Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\"'Mindset: The New Psychology of Success' by Carol Dweck was a very boring book for me personally, though I am sure that, for others, it is absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />\\"The whole entire idea behind the book is that if you just *think* a certain way, you'll almost automatically become better - better in school, better in your chosen career etc. And just what, exactly, is the genius mindset? Well, basically you have to:<br /><br />*Stay optimistic<br /><br />*Try harder the next time<br /><br />*Actually *enjoy* what you're doing/learning/teaching etc. If you're interested in something, it will stick to your brain. My own example: just ask any teenage girl the names of the members of One Direction, and you'll see what I mean. :-)<br /><br />*Never assume automatically that you can't do something, or something is too hard. One example the book gives relates to some students who were in one of the worst high schools in LA. However, then a teacher came and began teaching them college calculus - and they not only *learnt* it, they *excelled* in it and their results shot their school up to one of the best high school in Los Angeles. Another example was when some so-called retarded three and four year-olds ended up learning Aristotle and Shakespeare when regular high-schoolers didn't even know it.<br /><br />\\"Pretty cool, huh?<br /><br />\\"I would give the book three stars, though: one star for the plot (because, to be quite honest, I have had the \\"genius mindset\\" drilled into my head since I was old enough to stand up), and two stars for the short stories and examples, which were actually pretty cool.\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book (obviously) expands among the series. But, has a different feel to me.<br /><br />  BEST SERIES EVA PERIOD. :) ever
0393334988|5.0|As a mother who still tries to screen everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, it's been a while since I picked up a book *I* wanted to read, just for myself. When I started reading \\"The Railway Man\\" by Eric Lomax, I had no plans to let said daughter have it. It's a book written by a WW2 veteran, about his capture and subsequent torture by the Japanese Army. It's located in the \\"Adult\\" section of the library. It's been made into a movie. It's probably filled with graphic and stomach-churning descriptions of torture that only human being can inflict on each other and the language spoken in dire stress by desperate men. I. Was. Wrong. \\"The Railway Man\\" is one of the most moving books I've come across in a very long time, and all was achieved with none of the gratuitous and self-indulgent writing that comes with trying to sell a book. This must have been some kind of a cathartic release for Mr. Lomax, who clearly possesses more humanity than the average human being. The book is life-affirming, hopeful, and a true gift from a gentleman in the true sense of the word. I am so grateful to have read it, and so proud that said daughter found it similarly enriching. Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\" 'The Railway Man' by Eric Lomax was interesting, sad and memorable.<br /><br />\\"It is 1941, and young Eric Lomax has just joined the British Army. Little does he know that World War II is more than a simple skirmish that will soon end.<br /><br />\\"When the Japanese invade Singapore, Eric, as well as 250,000 men, is captured and forced to work on the infamous Burma-Siam railway. When he decides to make an illegal radio, though, so that the men may know what is happening outside the prison, he is caught and tortured, starved, catches many deadly diseases, loses his teeth, and many other things besides. The only Japanese he remembers vividl,y though, is the interpreter who told him exactly what his torturer was saying.<br /><br />\\"The war ends. Eric gets married, but their marriage breaks down due to Eric's silence and coldness, and his nightmares - all results from being a prisoner of war. He marries again, this time to a lady almost 15 years younger than him. Throughout it all, Eric is haunted by the memories of the past, and because of this, is sometimes extremely difficult to understand.<br /><br />\\"Then Eric finds out the Japanese interpreter is still alive. He, too, is haunted by the past, and has spent his entire life trying to atone for the mistakes he made during World War II.<br /><br />\\"Then, they meet - and forgive each other.<br /><br />\\"This story was a lot like what I always imagined the sequel to Anne Frank's 'The Diary of a Young Girl' to be like. Instead of a young Jewish girl getting sent to a concentration camp and dying, though, a young British soldier is horribly tortured and doesn't die. Then, he forgives his tormentor.<br /><br />\\"I would give the book five stars: two stars for the writing, two for the happy ending, and one for the fact that it is a true story.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like minecrart and I bought it for my kindle fire but it doesn't download. it says &quot;Thanks for purchasing your app will be downloaded&quot; then half way downloading it says &quot;sorry your app is unavailable to download&quot; something like that. what's the issue?
1400064287|4.0|As a mother who tries to screen everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I usually pick out books I think said daughter would enjoy before reading them and then passing them on once they pass muster. In the case of \\"Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die\\" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, though, said daughter had the benefit of *Daddy* screening it before requiring her to read the book. :-) As the case is in self-improvement books, though, too much from the same author(s), and it all starts to sound like a nag. My husband is a much more patient person than I am! Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\" 'Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die' by Chip Heath and Dan Heath was a very boring book compared to the other book I read, also written by Chip and Dan, called, `Switch: How To Change Things When Change Is Hard.' Okay, I'll take that back - it wasn't *very* boring, but I still think `Switch' was more interesting.<br /><br />\\"This book basically tells you how to make something popular or make something stick. One of my favorite examples, out of the many that they give, is actually a true story. Some people found out that movie popcorn is bad - *really* bad - for you, and they decided to tell the whole world. Unfortunately, they had absolutely no idea *how* to tell the whole world that the coconut oil in the popcorn was making them fat and unhealthy.<br /><br />\\"Until one guy solved the problem by making an advertisement. The advertisement basically said that one bag of popcorn is equal to eating a whole banquet of fatty foods: Big Macs, milkshakes, cookies, etc. Well, the ad worked and soon the movie popcorn business was so bad that pretty much all the movie theaters had switched from using coconut oil to *not* using coconut oil - hurrah!<br /><br />\\"So, *how* exactly are you supposed to make an idea stick? Well, I c-o-u-l-d tell you, but maybe you should just pick up this book and read it yourself. :-)<br /><br />\\"I would give the book four stars: two stars for the plot and two stars for the writing, which was still pretty funny.\\"
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As an engineer myself I found this book extremely entertaining<br />and almost impossible to put down.  I give it 11 stars out of 10.<br />I can't wait for another book from Mr. Weir.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Hands down, great movie. Looks good in blu-ray, songs are awesome, story is sweet. Just buy it, it's worth it. End of story
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The o<br /><br />nly one that has the kindle and I think it would take to set the first place of birth club is the unwanted and a half hour and aria and I love it is a few years back to root out of this is unwanted TeenS who really cares about the unwanted user experience and hxbhxj
B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a surprisingly fun, quick game.<br /><br />Quick because it's quick to learn.  Graphics and sound may come from the days of Super Nintendo, but what do you need when you're killing off otherwise useful time on your smartphone?<br /><br />Quick because it really performs great on my Galaxy Nexus - no waiting, no delays loading or while the phone thinks about what do do next - a welcome change from many of the games out there which tax the device's resources heavily!<br /><br />I'm keeping it on the phone for those moments when I need a little distraction.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game was interesting and fun and had a good story to follow. I couldn't just fly through the whole game it was nicely difficult a time or two. definitely can't wait for another like this
B0094K1K42|5.0|With the bad reviews, we were a little wary about watching it, but glad we did! Very dark humor, so you've got to be up to that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Beautiful. Thrilling. I couldn't set it down for a second. I've read it twice now and I think I'd still love it just as much the third time.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read it in 2 days, it was good but I could see  how it might not be for everyone
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This astounding book is highly recommended for all ages looking for an action packed romantic drama from it rich vocabulary to cossette
B005JR3Y5W|3.0|It's okay, funny, whatever.  With Hulu, there is really no need for me to purchase seasons of anything.  Besides I'm not a huge TV watcher.  If I miss it - oh well.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Megan and Connor are perfect for each other. It's got it's humor, romance, and sex haha. It's a great book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was drawn to this book because I was recently engaged to be married for the second time.  My first marriage lasted 22 years.  If I had known the \\"primary love languages\\" at that time I may have not gotten divorced.  Well, we can't change the past and I am going to try very hard to make my second chance at marriage successful!<br />The book helped me identify those areas that make me happy and those of my fiancé through simple exercises.  It was written in simple, easy to read format using different scenarios that I could identify with.<br />I have shared it with my fiancé and family. Although some were hesitant at first, they have taken an interest in how it works. It was great reading and would recommend to anyone who is involved in a relationship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it's my favorite and I don't even like books this book also inspired me to read other books too
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was referred to this book by a blog I follow and trusted her judgment and gave it a whirl. I ended up delighted at the steady read, the interesting pictures and how the story grew as I read. It enveloped me in a world that I found myself wanting to be a part of. Great read. Great fun. A unique new idea.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|RICK RIORDAN  did it again adding action with many different twists.. Love and action made this book awesome 5 stars all the way

B00632HWOG|1.0|After the upgrade, I can't get my messages at all on Kindle Fire....just a loading screen that never loads! I've. tried for days &amp; absolutely nothing is happening...
B00000JL86|5.0|I consider this right up there with the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast...a wonderful fairytale the kids will love.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I watched Dr. Alexander on OWN's Super Soul Sunday and I became curious enough to purchase the book for my cousin and myself.  I read the book in a very short time and learned a lot about the subject of NDEs.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the afterlife.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|When I read Fall of Giants, I could not wait for the sequel, and Ken Follett did not dissapoint!  I think he did an excellent job of providing historical context, without turning it into a history textbook.  I loved how all of the characters tied into one another in a subtle way.  His descriptions are vivid, believable, and I felt like I was right there in the action. You felt sympathy, desperation, laughter, agony, disgust, hate, elation, and joy. I do not care for the characters out of Russia - but it by no means is to say that I thought he did a bad job writing their story - I just didn't like the characters. I of course cannot wait for the 3rd book to come out, and I have actually started reading Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth series because I have enjoyed his writing so much.  If you enjoy historical fiction - Winter of the World is for you, excellent read - and my top pick for the year.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very good book and the story itself was a page turner.  I enjoyed it very much !
B000V39KDO|5.0|This was a great gift, my son-in law will enjoy watching it, thank you Amazon for making my Christmas shopping easier.
0440178002|5.0|I don't have the patience to write long reviews but I want to say that this book is one of the most intensely interesting, emotional, awesome tales I have ever read.  This book is deep and will affect you emotionally.  I read a lot and have enjoyed many books but this one was different, I would never forget this book and will read it again in the future, and again and again. If Shogun is not already in the all time greats of books, it needs to be, you don't have to be an expert to know you are reading a masterpiece here.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i am playing on the kindle hd. i am truly enjoying myself. the grafix are crisp and the music is quite soothing.
B007TR1R22|1.0|There are many parallels with Tolstoy's masterful work in this movie, but masterful is not an adjective to be applied here.  The movie drags heavily; one needs only the first five or ten minutes to establish the characters and their situation. About one-third of the scenes are comprised of Hester smoking and staring unhappily into space. \\"The heart<br />has reasons that reason does not know,\\" as Pascal famously said; yet I could find no reason to find this movie interesting or worth my time.
B00A3CVFMM|4.0|Fabulous music, but missing what feels like some of the key pieces of music from the film. I don't know of they're in the extended version or not. But I love this soundtrack!!
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I liked it but , in my opinion none of his book as can top The book Thief . I felt this book assent long enough, like they sorta of had to rush or, like it skipped over time a lot.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My 15 month old daughter has limited television time.  We have realized that she prefers either an episode of Sesame Street, an animated movie (like The Lorax), or a Disney movie.  The Lorax is by far her favorite thing to watch on the television.  When mommy and daddy put on The Lorax, our daughter will sit in her tiny toddler chair and watch the entire thing without moving a muscle.  Part of me wonders if this is 'healthy', but the far less neurotic and over analytical side is overjoyed by watching my daughter enjoy something so much.  For halloween, I sewed her a Lorax costume and she was a HIT!  Thank you for making this movie.  Now it's time to make it into a musical!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was concerned about the length of the book but the pages flew by! Loved the storyline and the characters. Stephen King's best ever.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|From the guy that brought you family guy comes a mildly amusing film about a bear who comes alive. The premise is ridiculous yes but I expected that the script would echo the absurdity of it all. How is that a teddy bear comes alive and NO ONE is fazed by that in the absolutely ridiculous world that is built around it.<br />The bear sounds like Peter from Family Guy, which is understandable as its the same person who wrote and created the characters on the show.<br />The movie played out like some of the Family Guys as of late, the potential to be funny is there, but it misses its mark. Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, one of the original writers of Family Guy, wrote some of the best episodes that I can remember about the show and she should have had her hand in writing this script.<br />The movie was unimaginative and totally predictable in a 80s theme style movie. Down to the childhood hero appearance. What a waste. I got 3 laughs out of the movie and they were just chuckles.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|The problem was my fault, not the product.  The product was nice and would have been great if I had order the right one, but I did not.  This case does not fit the Kindle Fire HD which is what I purchased it for, but Amazon took it back and I was able to order the correct one.<br /><br />This case will work great on the right Kindle, so don't over look it because of my error..
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Alright..OK... This movie has nothing Nothing NOTHING to do with wolves. Seriously, do not listen to the 1 star reviews who complain about the inaccuracy of the wolves in this film or the the cgi quality.. Blah Blah Blah... This movie is not about that at all. The wolves could be replaced with polar bears, being  lost at sea, or a tornado of piranhas... Whatever!!! The negative reviews are only complaining about the finger pointing to the stars. Look up!!<br /><br />This is a brave, honest, beyond moving meditative piece about male spirituality. This is existential psychotherapy at its absolute finest. This movie is everything Rollo May, Irvin D. Yalom, and Viktor Frankl were talking about. This is us facing our mortality ( and overcoming our fear of it) and finding meaning and purpose in our life, even in the direst of circumstances. We all walk into the den at some point. We have to find bravery and purpose in our marrow.<br /><br />This is the film that made Roger Ebert leave (shaken up) after watching (unable to review the next film)[...]<br /><br />Jesus, why are there so many 1 star reviews?I can not recommend this film enough. Yes it has some flaws, but what doesn't? I thought this was one of if not the best films of 2012 (Ok, I just Cloud Atlas... The Grey is in second place)

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always loved Stephen King, particularly the Dark Tower series, but I'm not as keen on the pure &#34;horror&#34; stories.<br /><br />11/22/63 blends many fiction themes together, and it works very well.  You have time travel and all of its associated quirks.  You have the JFK assassination story, and some of the theories surrounding it, and (I assume) Stephen King's version of how and why it happened.  And then there's the uniquely Stephen King twists and turns, spookiness and drama.<br /><br />This may now be my favorite Stephen King book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. The whole family is enjoying playing with this game. Thank you so much!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book kept me interested from start to finish.  I particularly liked the main character's regrets from the past intriguing her daughter to find resolution and forgiveness in present day.  It teaches the reader that keeping secrets traps you, whereas the truth often sets you free.  The bond that ties daughters to their mothers is, as always, impressive.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very fun game to play. We passed it around so that everyone in the room could play.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it! Couldn't put it down but I also wished it ended differently. Wanted to see if Alex and Katie got married.
B005XN3150|5.0|I love the modern spin that is on all of our favorite fairy tales. The actors are perfect. I just love the evil queen & rumplestilskin. It is an action-aventure/romance. If you like any story that start with once upon a time & ends with a happily ever after you wont be disappointed. Enjoy...

B008EKOO46|5.0|There are two basic reasons that I enjoy reading Jared Diamond's books.<br /><br />1. The first is that Diamond's intelligent objective way of taking in his experience and measuring it objectively and without prejudice is an exercise in how to think objectively and dispassionately ... a skill that is sorely needed in today's world.<br /><br />2. The value he imparts to the reader from doing #1 ... that is, we learn from his experience and his training how to look at societies and times different from ours.  Diamond imparts the core of anthropology in a way such that the reader hardly knows it's happening.  In short, Diamond is a force for how to naturally reinforce a scientific, objective way or looking at the world and informs while he is doing that.  What more can you ask from an author or a book?<br /><br />The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies follows in the progression of his other works that I have read, \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\", \\"Guns, Germs And Steel\\", and \\"Collapse\\" in that Diamonds uses the history and experiences he has gained through his career to fill a lot of the voids we all have in our understanding of what humans are and what our common experiences on this planet have been and to encourage us to think and question.  I find Jared Diamond's books all to be treasure in that they expand my conceptions of myself, of people in general and the history of this planet and most of all the way we think about all of those things.<br /><br />The book opens with some thoughts about the world today that most of us take for granted.  That we can go just about any place in the world and meet peolpe from almost everywhere in the world and \\"be tolerated\\" as he puts it.  Why this is astounding is that it is a total change from the way most human beings that have existed have lived.  So one aspect of the book is that Diamond makes conscious some of the things we are around so much we do not even see or think about.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book, from the title is how different groups and solved different problems, and why.  What is the range of human behavior in as many aspects as he describe.  Diamond explains  that \\"traditional societies in effect represent thousands of natural experiments in how to construct a human society.\\"  There are all manners of societies included and many aspected of life, child-rearing, spanking, parenting, trade, violence.<br /><br />This book is relevant and important because now that we, human beings, have grown conscious and can all be in one room so to speak, we have a chance to look at ourselves, each other, and our history and question and criticize why our societies either work or do not work and why and what might we do about it relative to how other humans have solved similar problems.<br /><br />What I like about Diamond is his thinking style, which is informed by both both science and well-analyzed experience - but all that style and experience would not be as useful if it were not given to us in the way Diamond presents his facts and ideas ... without propaganda, scientifically, pro and con.  Instead of writing to convince or persuade Diamond is writing to empower people by making them aware of who social spaces they probably never thought about or had occur to them.<br /><br />This is in evidence in \\"The World Until Yesterday\\" with implications for today of many of the ideas from his previous books but some new ones as well, for example Diamond talks about the functions of religion in societies.  Religion which has gotten so much bad press from all directions lately does have a function, and that function may have gotten stuck or be a void in many current societies in their clashes with modernity.  The first point Diamond makes is how fast time is moving relative to our species now and how are beings are more or less totally at sea without a map relative to all the time that has gone before, yet we never have any discussions about this.<br /><br />Ithink Diamond wants to illuminate and make conscious some of the principles that applied to people and shaped our historic course to broach the conversation of now that we are not driven unconsciously by events, can we bring some of these ideas to bear to make life better - and in measured scientific ways than otherwise would be just regimented by those on the top of societies ... which from \\"Collapse\\" are often the marginal force in NOT changing and adapting.<br /><br />Any effort to accomplish what Diamond takes on in this book would be admirable, but especially by Diamond and with the foundation of his previous books is really building a valuable toolkit of ways of looking at things, how to think, how to keep and open mind, and how to question.  A style that I first encountered with another favorite writer of mine, Carl Sagan.  Jared Diamond is one of a few superlative authors that have proved themselves valuable to me who shares his experiences and knowledge in ways that make me never want to miss one of his books.
B000S6UZE2|1.0|i received my item and when i opened it i noticed the inside case was cracked then i attempted to play it but i mistakenly i bought a dvd that could only be watched in the UK and they thought it was ok to not let me know that i would not be able to see it in USA were im purchasing it from.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is story of a life. It really is one of the best. Read it, and you will feel the same way.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|5 stars says it it all  a must read for teacher fans. Leaves u wanting more from Jack. Ready for next book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|These games are great and I have all of them.  This particular game only needs one thing...an option to turn off the facebeek interface.  Not everyone wants to post a million stats on facebook or social media.  We should be have a way to turn it off if we choose.
143911000X|5.0|How can you not love this book. Absolutely amazing. It is a joy to read and an amazing experience to relate to in personal life. I have gifted this book to close friends and we enjoy quote the code every day. A must have for all people who have those childhood friends with whom you never have to pretend and anything goes.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am obsessed with this game I play it almost all day long! I highly recommend this to anyone, great for all ages too!
1439181780|5.0|I have read this book twice and have given a copy to several friends as a gift. Gives a practical guide to staying the course for introducing love into your daily routine and giving an entirely new outlook on living your full potential.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Good movie. I feel the plot action and pacing are a lot better than the original the hulk movie with Eric Bana.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I usually don't like giving low scores but frankly the Sci-Fi network could have produced a better movie than this for less than 1% of the budget. Colin Farrell showed up to the set I assume but he must have left his acting ability in is Escalade Hybrid. Jessica Beil umm she's pretty. Kate Beckinsale plays herself in the film.  Woodbine's Harry was the only interesting character in the film and he got shot in the head. Mabey this film should have been shot in the dark with no sound.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game is great.. the story line is good. the graphic is good. the game kept me entertain for hours.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Loved this book. Only took me a day and a half to read it all. Couldn't put it down for long! Highly recommended book. Ellen is a very likeable person in her writing and also on TV. Always doing something good; for people, animals, etc. Keep up the positivity!
0307361012|4.0|When a Norwegian girl is murdered in Australia, the Norwegian Police sends Harry Hole to investigate the matter there. Away from his normal playing field and in a completely different country, Harry has to overcome quite a few hurdles in order to get to the bottom of the matter. Soon he connects the crime to series of others that lead us on to realize that there's a serial killer on the loose.<br /><br />This book has the most wonderful narration I have read in recent times. Seriously, I think even if the plot had lacked strength, which it doesn't, or the characters turned out to be crap, which they aren't, I am sure, even then I would have enjoyed reading this book. So club up that narration with an awesome plot and strong characters, this book was a total rockstar.<br /><br />Mostly in mystery/thriller genre when there's a series dedicated to a particular character (Hercule Poirot / Alex Cross for example), the protagonist somehow always end up standing out very distinctly from the other characters. I mean - with Hercule Poirot it is always `grey matters' and there's probably not a single supporting character or antagonist who can actually stand shoulder to shoulder with him. But again there are a rare few characters, like a Professor James Moriarty, in the Sherlock Holmes series, who make as big an impression on you as the protagonist himself. So, it was refreshing to read about a protagonist working together with a very strong Australian counterpart. Though Andrew is no Professor Moriarty, he has certain strength in his character that I admired Jo Nesbo for.<br /><br />From the summary on goodreads, I realized thought this is the first book in the Harry Hole Series, it wasn't the first one to be published. I have only read The Phantom (the latest one in the series before) and so I was somewhat a blank slate - with a few scribbles at the very bottom, when it comes to Harry Hole's character. The Harry we see in `The Bat' and the Harry we see in `The Phantom' are so very different! While this glimpse of a younger and less burdened Harry was something I enjoyed, I am really intrigued about and would love to know the twists and turns that his life takes to take him to the point where he is in `The Phantom'<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? Yes! Yes! Yes!o very different! While this glimpse of a younger and less burdened Harry was something I enjoyed, I am really intrigued about and would love to know the twists and turns that his life takes to take him to the point where he is in `The Phantom'<br /><br />Do I recommend this book?

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Great movie if you like Seth Mcfarlane. Not going to win any cinematic awards but you will have a good laugh.
0399160450|4.0|Mark Greaney's second effort in writing Tom Clancy's books for him. And this is an improvement on the excellent Locked On. While it is a shame that Clancy no longer writes 'his' books, in Mark Greaney he has found a very good writer who is able to take the Clancy style and give it his own voice.<br /><br />In Threat Vector the Chinese are the bad guys, advancing a shooting war over the South China Sea with cyber warfare to weaken and confuse the US. So while Jack Ryan sr does things at a Presidential level, son Jack Jr is involved with \\"The Campus\\" an off the books intelligence and assassination organisation. So both Jacks follow their own paths to the same conclusion, the US is under attack and even The Campus might be exposed....<br /><br />It's the Clancy style of old (before he...er..'lost it') with the blend of geo-politics and human agents and intelligence on the ground. And both Jacks have more logical characters this time, Senior shows leadership while Junior is less of an action hero and more considered and logical. And it works.<br /><br />Once the action hots up, the pages started to fly by in a very enjoyable thriller.<br /><br />If Clancy and his advisors have any sense, they will be begging Greaney to write another.
B00A757EFW|5.0|You don't have to use a joystick.  You can take it with you.  The sound is irritating.  I would recommend pac-man-lite to a friend.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I appreciated how they continued the movie from where the last movie left off but did it in an artistic manner that included viewers that were new to the series.  Each movie in the series ends with unresolved danger but I think that the movie prior to this movie ended with the heroes in a much too specific dangerous situation almost like the movie was cut at that point.  This movie had to resolve that conflict at the beginning without seeming to be &#34;Part 2&#34; and I think that they did a marvelous job doing that.  And of course as usual the zombies and action sequences were top rate.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I grew up seeing the first Conan, and loved it. It was a classic. This remake was like most remakes good, but not great. It could have been better. Rose McGowan seemed a bit off in her role as the wicked witch. None of the other characters even came close to sticking with me after watching the movie, unlike with the original which stuck with me for years. The new Conan was good looking, but not really that good an actor.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing love story but sad at the end. I think I wanted to cry but couldn't bring myself to do so!!!
B005SZAEYO|5.0|I fell in love with this after Episode One. I loved the family. I loved the Haunted House, and the ghosts, and the twists. I'll be on board for season 2.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have been curious about Angry Birds but couldn't find it until I got my Kindle Fire. Cute, addicting game. Chose 4 bacause nothing is perfect.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The movie was very moving.It did not go in the direction that I<br /> thought it would go. It had a great ending. I purchased the movie, &#34;Courageous&#34; for a<br />co-worker as a gift.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I play this game when I have nothing else to do. I love all the cute pets!!! I definitely would recommend it.
B008602KQI|5.0|May the odds be ever in your favor!<br /><br />Loved every minute of this flick! Can hardly wait for the next ones.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Have played several HO games on my Kindle and this is the best. Difficult enough to keep you interested but clues when you need them. Zooms in to help you look for objects. Graphics are great. Well worth the money! Hope they have more games as good as this one!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|its challenging enough that you may need to find a few help videos to beat a level, but not so hard that you lose interest in the game. it made a great free app of the day, but is totally worth the purchase.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I watched the unrated trailer before I rented this movie, so I was not surprised at the content. It is offensive in a funny way. A man and his come-to-life teddy bear and their childish ways. Worth a watch, but don't complain at the content!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I purchased two of these as gifts for my daughter and sister for Christmas.  Both recipients really love the music!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a nice app that I can use all the time. Thanks for making this app free to download
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was my families favorite out of all three MIBs. The actor that played the young K was spot on! Great job.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I have loved this game for years & I was excited to find it for my Kindle. It will keep me busy for hours!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is an excellent book -- could not put it down. I felt like I was right there with the characters
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is very nicely made, high quality case that fits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly.  It is also a bit on the bulky side but that is okay since it was for my 10 year old son and I like the extra protection.  It is really cool how it rotates so it can be viewed vertically or horizontally.  The one issue we found was the cutouts.  Basically there is only one way to put it in the rotator case that will allow the power usb port to be accessed, which is fine, but that also happens to be on the same side as the notch that would lock the case in on a horizontal viewing angle for sitting it on your desk, which means that when you fold the kindle into the case that charging port is no longer accessible.  So basically you can either rotate the kindle so the port faces out when the case is closed (but now so does notch, or you can charge with the case open.  It is not a hige deal, but it is a slight design flaw so I am knocking off one star for that.  Overall, it provides excellent protection along with a versatile design.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|this movie is a tribute to friendship, it teach us to be better people, to keep our promises, to give value to the stuff that really matters.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This cast made the movie for me. John Malkovich is hilarious!!!! Morgan Freeman!!!! I was going to gift this movie, but decided I couldn't part with it. The family member got another movie instead.
B005VPRDAY|2.0|Quality is good and the box is nice box is WAY oversized for the number of pieces you get. It hardly covers the bottom of the box. Many are tiny round or flower pieces.<br /><br />My son loves the purple bricks though. It would be nice if they had a box with ALL of the colors instead of \\"pink for girls blue for boys \\" why cant they both have every color? I ordered another set with more colors to add to this one
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I love this CD. It's a must have for all Josh Groban fans. I will also be ordering his new one with the single Brave. I can't wait.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect really was pitch perfect. I really enjoyed the storyline of this movie and the singing was great. I enjoyed the songs so much I got the soundtrack and have been listening to it quite a lot. I really like Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow, so I wanted to see this movie when I found out they were in it. Rebel Wilson is also incredibly funny, and the Lily, played by Hana Mae Lee is a pretty interesting character as well. I really want to watch this movie again, but I think I will purchase the DVD instead of renting it again. If you're thinking about watching this movie, go for it!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|You can't go wrong with Johnny Depp. If you are a fan of the TV series you shouldn't expect the same thing. It's a good movie though.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I love Katy Perry. That being said, I waited a while to see this movie because I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I watched this movie on a flight from Las Vegas to Seattle and I was entertained the entire time. I wish I would have seen this movie sooner. Katy is an awesome person and a great performer. I hope she stays around for a while!
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a wonderfully different take on the traditional puzzle experience. Gorgeous photos...varying sizes to choose from...and the new take on the jumbled up puzzle makes it even more fun!
B0085YNML2|5.0|In the same great vein as Cut the Rope,,,great thoughtful fun. Many levels of ever more complex solutions for hours of fun.
B00AI7G2YS|2.0|Does not work on the iPad<br />Ihave over 100 empty pages<br />I've tried downloading several times bit the same problem occurs<br />What I can read is great - wish I could access the whole book via kindle  on the iPad
B003JTHS5E|4.0|Very easy to read and informative.  It should be required reading for all adults!  Although it won't fix bad relationships, it will certainly help many.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It's a lightweight case for a Kindle and can be propped up.  It was a perfect match for what I was looking for and the price was just RIGHT!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was afraid the second book wouldn't be as good as the first, but it was actually even better! Can't wait for the third.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Downloaded this morning. This is a really fun game. I think this may be the one that stays on my Kindle Fire for awhile. And it was free. It is worth the money though. Good job dev. I find no complaints yet except I can't seem to save my place without restarting the level. Not a big deal, just makes me spend more time playing!
B007EW9ISM|3.0|Just didn't work for me. I just had to press WAY too hard on my 10 inch tablet to make this thing register. Maybe it's designed and tested for smart phones which have much smaller screens and thus require  much less pressure to register with the glass screen. I don't know. The impression I had was I should not have to press THAT hard to get it to register a pen stroke.<br /><br />It's clearly well built and from the other reviews people are clearly happy with it, thus, 3 stars.<br /><br />I don't think I like these things generally because I feel like they won't let me select nearly a fine enough point on my screen to be useful. The tips on all these kinds of things are thick and hollow, not at all pencil like, and they need to be depressed using some considerable force -perhaps depending on your screen size- and quite some distance before they finally register with your screen. When they finally do register, the tip of the thing is now just a fat, smushed face against your screen unsuitable for, say, precisely selecting text which as it happens is about 90% of what I spend my time doing. I can do this easily with my finger, so the issue is with the stylus.<br /><br />If you just want to stab at big application buttons on a smart phone's screen, then maybe this stylus is just the thing for you and you'll love it like a lot of the other reviewers. For me, I gave it to someone with a smartphone who tried it and thought it was just awesome.  So there you go.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great for travel and hotels and grandma's snoring. Get it today for you and your children. It has lots of options and you can turn off the kindle to save peer and it stays on!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This was a great buy. It is in perfect condition with all the extra leaflets in the box. Very good quality and worth every cent,
B0015XHP4K|5.0|The item was shipped on time.  It is a great Rambo box set for a gift or just to own it yourself.  For the price the box set is cheaper than buying the movies seperately.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is an awesome tool for getting God's word out of the pages and into your heart. It is easy to use and really keeps you on track
B004GGQMRY|4.0|The movie was shipped on time.  It is a great movie that is available on blu-ray.  It is a good comedy with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cuirse.
B00136RZUI|5.0|I have listened to this almost everday. He is such a wonderfully talented guitarist. I would love to play like him.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This is a great movie . For those of us that grew up in the 80`s this was always a favorite
B002M9WW30|5.0|This was the best deal ever for one of the great movie Franchises.  I look forward to my moive marathon.
B00008K7AM|5.0|We had recorded this off of NetFlix, and watched it several times.  But somehow it got deleted (by my son) and we missed it!  My daughter put this on her wish list so she could share it with her friends.  LOVE THIS FILM.
B000I8ERVM|5.0|This is based on a true story. If you believe in the denomic spirts.  Then I would recommend this movie.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|I got this as a supplement to the others in the series.  Great show - love it!  Package arrived safely and on time.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is funny.  It is a must own movie.  After renting it I will be purchasing it for sure now!
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about the Terminator movie.  Loved it in the theatre and love it on DVD.  Good choice.
B00AIGQTEC|5.0|Classic!  As always Prince is on point! It's good to hear instrumentation and vocals on a track.<br /><br />Keep it going!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Nothing less than one has come to expect from Adobe.  Their products set the world standard for creating portable documents.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Just finished book two ready and sad to start book three. If you've not picked up the trilogy stop what you're doing now and get it!
1439152802|4.0|While I'll read any novel that Kate Morton writes, they are starting to seem more than a little formulaic. Still, as with Morton's other books, this one kept me enthralled. Deju vu, it's true, but great characters and imaginative plot twists kept me reading and reading into the wee hours. Plus, I experienced a new admiration for the brave Brits who experienced the horrors of WWII.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best one yet I hope you come out with another one these are my favorite books to read they are very funny and pretty hard<br />Once again please come out with another one please Jake seliga
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a book you won't be able to put down I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />I can't wait to start the next book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a  very well written book. It made me laugh out loud, cry and shake with anticipation. I loved the characters and I have to say that it may be my new favorite book! A must read for sure!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love his game!! It is so much fun!! It is really fun to play in the car, if you are having a long ride!! :) &lt;3
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like the book because Greg keeps on getting dumped in really dumb ways. I thought it was really funny.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I will admit that the author is very funny and loves the humor. This book is truly very amazing. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh A LOT!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|1. Creatively written by using different point of views and through the tapes<br />2. Relatable to a teenager because things that occur in the story can actually happen.<br />3. A controversial topic that makes  you think about life<br />4. Suspenseful enough to make you want to keep reading<br />5. Easy to follow<br />6. Author uses fantastic writing  skills to portray the feeling  of the characters<br />7. A lot of different ideas come together in a \\"snowball effect\\"<br />8. Many characters make  the story more believable<br />9. Doesn't take long to read<br />10. A classic use of old  technology to show new age problems<br />11. Dual perspectives make  it more interesting<br />12. Has a deep message that what you do can have a big impact on other people<br />13. BECAUSE ITS REALLY GOOD.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoy seeing almost everything Judy Dench does, and this was no exception. This was a movie about facing realities and adapting to change. I enjoyed all the characters and loved hearing the music.....definitely not a disappointment---not academy award winning, but very thought provoking and enjoyable!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that more ppl should read the book and its good for u to know some garment and spelling
B00594XOZU|2.0|I didn't realize this only worked if you have other people on the same app. None of my friends have a kindle or anything, so no one I know uses this app. I deleted it from my kindle.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The most fun I have had since assasins creed 3 don't listen to the idiot who gave this app 1star he's not a brronie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I haven't had any issues with this app on my kindle fire hd. It works great and doesn't freeze up my system.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This is a must have set of Led Zep for everyone. It will be hard to find a repeat of performance in a live setting by this amazing band!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very good quick read book.  The plot was a little predictable but i enjoyed the chase. Will enjoy reading it a second time.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I have a FireWire 400 iSight camera and needed an adapter to connect it to my new late 2012 Mac Mini.  The options appeared to be this pigtail-style adapter, and a couple of rigid adapter options.<br /><br />I prefer the pigtail style for 3 reasons:<br />1.  Doesn't stick straight out so cable management behind the Mini is easier<br />2.  Less strain on the FW800 port on the back of the Mac<br />3.  Small FW800 connector doesn't block or interfere with adjoining sockets (this could be even more important with a Macbook than with a Mini or iMac)<br /><br />Works great, no complaints.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|I've been wanting to see this series since &#34;Justified&#34; first aired, because I love the talent of Walton Groggins.  Keeping in mind that this series is 10 or so years old, I still must only give it a 3 out of 5.  Perhaps I've seen too many great series along the way?  Or, perhaps my expectations were too high?  But I found this series to be unrealistic.  No police district would keep such a band of rouge cops.  I will not be watching the remaining seasons, when I can watch &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, &#34;Homeland&#34;, &#34;Justified&#34;, and so on.
B009P13RQY|5.0|The thing that has always stood out to me about The Sword is their unique sound that creates a mood every time you put on one of their albums. Apocryphon is yet another landscape of songs that is refreshing. It is an album that you can put on and not feel a dull moment. Even on the special edition, the live cuts sound incredible and their cover of ZZ Top's \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" hits it right on the mark. Is almost like the bands have been neighbors forever.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten into The Sword yet, Apocryphon is the album you should check out.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is no different from being on my desktop. I have been a Yahoo user for years for my email.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This is a nice collection with a LOT of songs.  There's a good mix of material from across Van Morrison's career.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|By far the best television series I have ever seen.  You know when you have a program that attracts all ages, both male and female viewers, you have a winner.  Brilliantly written story line, intriguing character development, outstanding acting by the entire cast, breath-taking location and costumes.  Love every minute of Downton Abbey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book! It was hard to stop reading it. I look forward to reading the next two. I would recommend this to a friend.
B005PV81MS|4.0|My husband is from the UK and I am from America. So, I am fairly familiar with slang and such. But, I admit, I had trouble with some of the dialogue. Even with that I really enjoyed the story and acting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so mush I play it every day I unlock lock a new level at lease every day
B004G6009K|5.0|My six year old cannot get enough of this movie. The story is so much fun with Rapunzel being able to stand up for herself and find her place in the world. Even as an adult, I can enjoy the humor. I really hope to see more if Rapunzel in the future.<br /><br />We first watched this on Netflix and I have to tell you that the quality of even the regular DVD far surpasses what we saw there.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I saw no redeeming qualities in this book.  It was not believable and rather depressing. I read it for my book club and was very disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Literally just finished Hopeless. What an amazing read! My head is reeling from the story still. It was incredibly well written and filled with so much \\"living.\\" I actually think it's better than slammed and point of retreat - which is saying a lot! Just a breathtaking book. And yes, I love Holder!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this game. I'm a big fan of the hidden object games anyway, but this one had some fun little twists. great game for the price in my opinion!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Definitely a fantasy.  Good book that was more that just sex.  Looking forward to reading more from E L James
B000Z27HLS|3.0|Enjoy all Masterpiece productions....this one I had missed so glad to have it in my collection..worth the watch....keep them coming....
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Nice easy read.  Made me laugh.  I am now a Janet Evanovich fan.  I do love my easy reads and hers are it
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Not one of my favorites...but well done...I will be on the look out for more Amanda Root productions....keep them coming...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Definitely a fantasy.  Good book that was more that just sex.  Looking forward to reading more from E L James
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A good book, but it has some of the key elements that 50 shades has, minus the graphic erotica. Still a good read.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I've used other apps for the weather but this is the best one. It looks great on my Kindle Fire HD. Worth the $1.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Keeps the kids occupied for hours.  Very challenging for all the kids.  They love it and use it all the time.
B007P7UF0G|1.0|It is unplayable.  The music is there but none of the singing or talking.  Only the music.  I am very disappointed.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Wanda Sikes (Granny) rocked this film. And how can you not love the squirrel story?! Great party soundtrack -really made it fun from start to finish.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Great game, simple and fun. I think they probably could have done more graphics wise, but otherwise a great game.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I rented this movie for my husband and ended up watching it too.  It was very entertaining!  Very highly recommended.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My 4 year old daughter watchs her brothers play with legos often and she too will create things. I bought this set for her as a surprise and its one of her favorite things! Perfect small size and cute colors. Makes a few different things as well.  Perfect for any little girl. Compliments the other Friends sets she has as well.
B008Y6TD5A|1.0|This film is ULTRA boring and the plot is ridiculously implausible.  I kept waiting for the action or drama to start but it was boring from start to finish.  Skip this rental it is not worth the money.
B00280LYIM|4.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth is an exciting journey through an underground maze in Percy's continued attempt to save the world as we know it. In this volume we learn more about Nico, add in a new friend Rachel Dare, and delve further into Percy and Annabeth's relationship. Grover continues his search for Pan, which is evermore important now that he is put on a tight deadline. All of this, plus the threat of Kronos returning to power, adds up to a fun and exciting journey!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|well designed and fun story line.<br />games were not too hard to solve and navigating was easy. liked the plot twist.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great action sequences! Love the humorous dialogue throughout the movie by Robert Downey, Jr. Story was well-written and captivating throughout.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|great cd  Very clean sound Harrison's sweet voice really comes through on this  demos and pre recordings are great  songs
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast and furious<br />Finished it in two days<br />Couldn't put it down for fear of missing something.<br />Looking forward to the next two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is wow! This was an amazing read. The feeling and emotions made me feel like I was in the book. I felt all of Sky's heartache and sadness and how amazingly strong she was. This book gives hope to anyone in any kind of tough situation.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read the book twice and saw the movie 3 times.  I am glad the author wrote the book as it made a fantastic movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This a good book.  You have to read it. It is the best Jeff Kinney book I have ever read
1451648537|1.0|This book arrived in bad condition.  I could not give as a gift.  It is a hard cover and came without the paper cover.  Very dissatisfied.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|No one in our family had seen this....now we just need to get a blue ray player to enjoy the rest of the disks.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've liked all the \\"Bosch\\" books and this one was no exception. Bosch is my kind  of cop hero; older, wiser but not the macho, super hero kind of guy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best novels I've ever read. So good, that I immediately read her two other books in the same day.  Will recommend to everyone. This is a book and characters you don't easily forget!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had my attention from the get go! I'm ready to start reading the next book! It's very addicting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|IT'S GREAT AND EVEN BETTER WHEN YOU TURN YOUR TEXT ON SO IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND SINCE YOU CAN READ WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. NOW WAITING FOR SEASON 3 TO START.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is a game were you run around trying to solve puzzles and save a freand and things like that meaning of speach.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You won't want to cook dinner or do any other type of domestic duties until you have read each page. OMG! a page turner.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A fun yet simple game that can easily be enjoyed again and again! Easy to grasp controls and fun theme make this game fully enjoyable in my book!
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Do not buy this Lego set, I was sucked in as my 8 year old son loves MineCraft. Very small box and not any where near worth the money. Should be a $12-15 Lego set. Very disappointed and money thrown away......Triple UGH!!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I purchased this because I loved the song &#34;the A Team&#34;, but discovered the album is even better than the song.  I found many hidden jewels they don't play on the radio, and I listen to this on repeat.
B009E3EY4M|4.0|Well, if you couldn't make it London, England to the '02 .....This is the next best thing! The boys N A I L E D  I T !!!!.
B007TMON8M|5.0|I love this game.  It is engaging, and accurate at the same time.  Some of the levels are really difficult, but I appreciate that, and I would recommend it to everyone.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This was a gift for my mom for the holidays, she had aleady seen it and loved it.  I hope to watch it soon.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Fun movie! It's not trying to be an Oscar contender... My wife and I enjoyed it for a simple fun movie night at home.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This was a gift for my friend, she turned me on to the show and I fell in love with it.  We have both only seen the the fist couple of episodes of this season. Can't wait to see the rest!
B006RXPTNM|5.0|My wife and I had few expectation when first viewing this movie. We were so taken with the story and acting we HAD to own this title.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This was a gift fom my gandmother to my mom for the holidays.  They both love the show, but have not seen the ealier episodes and both were super excited to see them.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I found it odd that this game makes you escort each customer to the toilet after feeding them. It is also too fast-paced to be relaxing and adorable.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This was a gift for my mom for the holidays.  I don't think she has seen it yet.  It looks interesting, but I'm not sure if I will watch it because Kristen Stewart is an awful actress
B005LAJ23A|1.0|I haven't even received it in the mail yet and it was ment to be a christmas preasent u guys suck
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I only started watching this show about two years ago and wanted to catch up on the old episodes.  I got the first two seasons seasons for the holidays last year.  This is a must have for any How I Met Your Mother Fan
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think that this was an excellent book I enjoyed  it a lot. I recommend this book to anyone who can read.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|was not sure about the style of the book however it has hooked me and I found it to be amazing.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|5stars. It kept me wanting to read and see what going to happen next. It was a really good read.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad since he loves Michael Jackson and he couldn't be happier!!
0671578642|4.0|Read this in PB yrs ago and want to revisit yhe series on Kindle, but only in order. Hence my question, when? For this book.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|Arrived on time - - great gift.  Grandson LOVED it!!!  Packaged in such a manner that he was able to assemble it without a lot of help.
B004LQI0HE|4.0|Good, but hard to quite replicate the book itself, even thought the author was one of the producers.  The movie had to give away the &#34;secret&#34; of Hallsham too early.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love simple yet challenging games like this. It has many levels even with the free app! Thank you Big Duck Games LLC.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Sunshine is not a fast-paced, surprise around every corner sci-fi movie. As in any space-based movie some of the visuals/events don't quite match with our knowledge of &#34;what's out there.&#34; However, it's not worse than most and a whole lot better than space-based &#34;action&#34; (vs sci-fi) films. What Sunshine is (or becomes as you watch it) is a reflection of our existence. For sure, it finally gravitates toward a simplistic 'what-if' view, but the journey getting there is filled with genuine moments of reflection. Everyone takes this movie seriously, they obviously wanted to communicate a message and viewpoint. Whether or not you agree with that viewpoint, the questions posed along the way are worth pondering upon.
068817776X|5.0|The book was easy to read. The story was very intense. It covered many perspectives of all the characters involved. This is one of the best holocaust survivor stories and I've read many.
1559408898|4.0|I first saw Robocop in the theater as a first-run movie -- felt like barfing after the opening scenes. Of course, payback is coming and it is ultimately satisfying. All the stop-action effects were brilliant...back when it was first released. Today, it is still impressive and fits the &#34;robo&#34; nature of machines -- but I guess expectations for some might be higher now. Nonetheless, the characters drive the movie and like any older classic sci-fi movie, you easily accept the logic of the limited movie technology.<br /><br />The social commentary in Robocop is obvious, no need to think too hard. Unfortunately, some of the motivations behind the privatization of public services is still with us and gaining ground. In the movie, good guys win and bad guys lose -- at least for a while. In real life, it's not so easy.
B003THJA1G|3.0|The reception is great. There are slight pauses were commercials were. I like being able to watch it anywhere. Worth the money - in fact it was less this way.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I cannot play this video on linux despite having a very fast computer with a very good nvidia graphics card. The video starts playing and then a retarded amazon notification pops up saying it can't play it because of my flash player and it is unfixable. Well if it started playing and then stopped due to a pop up that has to be DRM. Amazon you need to knock it off now.<br />The movie is fine.
B007HACDLK|4.0|there are just certain books i read and flynn is one of them...  character depth, locations outside my home town, a fast read...  if you haven't read flynn.  start w/ his earlier books.  you are drawn in... and read to the last page
B005H9B44A|4.0|I cannot watch any video free or paid for because of amazons DRM insistence failure on linux.<br />Thor the movie is fine.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|of course i chose because it's a ludlum book.  gritty, good, fast paced, typical ludlum fare so I consider it a good watch.  actually this character is probably closer to 'real' than pretty boy matt damon who did a good job as bourne.  if there is a sequel?  I'm there.
B0010SEN18|5.0|Lighting and situations that's what it is all about.  Joe does a beautiful job talking about each scene and how the lighting affects the scene and what he did to get the affect.  Really great to see it done from a master.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very handy to know the weather when your out somewhere and need to know what the weather is gonna be like. Nice to know if you need that rain coat or those sunglasses.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|The author seems to know his subject and presents the information very well. I especially like the pictures. Would like to have more of them
B009UX2YAC|2.0|the grand daughters tried this game and quickly switched to a different game - perhaps other games were just more fun for them
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a great novel to read. It really went deep into a high school experience and everything that goes with it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|the little one liked this game OK. the music that accompanies it is very catchy will keep this one even though i won't personally play it
B004MC8CA2|3.0|The app itself is great.  However it moves slow and sometimes it will freeze up. Doing that causes me to shut it down and start over. A little frustrating.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I have been meaning to read this book for a long time have not finished the book -- it downloaded very quickly
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this product very much since I am a Facebook fan. I recommend this to all people that love Facebook.
B000Z45PEC|4.0|My son is obsessed w t h e m o v i e so finding this  toy for The price was great! It i s definitely meant for an older child..not a product to rough play w..
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I can sum this book up in two words...Life Changing! It captures the very essence of why we should value every moment of our lives, good and bad. I found myself in one of the characters in this book; that played a major role in the way I mentally accepted this book. I definitely recommend this book to EVERYONE! Very user and reader friendly for all! YOU WONT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!
B004QX07G4|3.0|Read this book and had a few laugh out loud moments. Most of it was rather lame. It was worth the $1.99 I spent, but would probably not recommend it to others.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|What I like the instant video is that once you own you can watch multiple times. The quality is great.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|It's a cute clever little idea. Some parts are also little confusing but not to bad. Super simple. I have already recommended it to friends and family.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've down loaded both free flow games.. &amp; both games are pretty fun.. I think the bridges one might be a little more tricky, but for me both are fairly easy.. That's not to say I don't refresh the board a few times, sometimes, to make sure I get perfect each time ;) Fun &amp; I play a lot!
B005FISBTO|1.0|I pay for a product and they decide to have un-skippable ads on every disk with a major spoiler for the season you are watching.  Thanks a bunch.  DO NOT BUY.  Don't support this kind of garbage from the industry.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|We received it sooner than expected.  The price was 75% less than offered in the stores, and it is the same item and manufacturer.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent plot. Keeps readers interest . A real page turner.  Reacher is an almost realistic hero..Another success added to Child's list. Would recommend to anyone.
B009EANE3M|4.0|It seems a little heavier than the other album and has more rapping in it but it's really good and i would recommend it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an AMAZING read!  I couldn't put it down.  I was laughing, crying and completely feel in love with the characters.  I wish she would write more about Sky and Holder.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game. It keeps her occupied while I prepare dinner or clean up a room in the house. It is easy enough for a 5 year old to play, but, also a tad challenging to keep her engaged without being bored.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|We own two new, popular makes of printers.  This app is not compatible with either the Samsung or Canon.  Therefore, we cannot rate the program itself, since we have been unable to use it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I truly loved this book it was just a perfect fit to the harlequin family, the characters and story were engaging and delightful to get attached to. I was crying, laughing, and sighing threw the story getting caught up, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a romance with amazing depth, and captivating scenes.
B000AQJPQE|3.0|This is only ok.  Kind of cheap.  The wires are very thin and bend to easy.  They get stuck and than the thing won't turn.  Wouldn't get anain.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Worse book I have read in a long time. I stayed with it to the end but I would not recommend it to anybody.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Liked the book book a lot, could have had more detail though but maybe my having seen the movie first affected my perception and feel of the book. We will soon find out when I read the next one which I definitely am.
B00A3OTNTC|5.0|I listen to anything and everything ranging from classical music, to classical rock, to hardcore rap and pop music. I'm Pitbull fan because his energy is contagious, and shines through on every track. This album is no exception to his norm, and far exceeds my expectations.<br /><br />With an eclectic array of featured artists ranging from Chris Brown to Christina Aguilera and The Wanted, each track has its own unique sound, and even touch on Pit's roots in the track &#34;I'm Off That&#34; with a gritty hiphop sound JLo's accompanyment on &#34;Drinks for You&#34; has a fantastic loungey vibe to it. &#34;Tchu Tchu Tcha&#34; is one of my favorite tracks that I can't help but dance along to.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great, versatile album - a must for any Pitbull fan, and enjoyable for anyone who is a fan of contemporary pop music.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|He's Carlos--what more can you say?  Have loved his work since the '60's.  Keeps getting better with age--like good wine!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This has been a staple in our family's Christmas since it was released. Sadly, when we moved a few years ago, we apparently lost the physical copy. My brother had never seen the movie before, so we purchased it Prime out of convenience, and he absolutely loved it.<br /><br />This is a family friendly movie, engaging for both youngsters and adults alike. Some of it would be a bit weird/spooky for younger kids, but the claymation is mesmerising. My brother is functionally 7 or 8 (he has Down Syndrome), and there were a few moments he looked at me pretty wide-eyed, but he wanted to watch it again and again. We ended up buying a physical copy for him, and he is currently learning all of the songs to drive me nuts.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very good game. I really enjoyed playing. It held my interest. I would recommend this game to any one who enjoys search and find games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautiful book. Tragic and heartwarming. Well described pain of lost loved ones. The morale of the story is to not take things for granted.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|I wanted to see this when it was in the theaters but it wasn't there long. Love M Knight...but this was not one of his best. It was quite a stretch for me to buy into it and it didn't include the usual &#34;slightly humorous&#34; installation of his other movies. It's worth watching a couple of times and I will still go see his other movies. This just had a &#34;Can't afford to get out of the elevator in this movie&#34; element to it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|When my son brought his lovely fiance' and her Dad up to visit us for Christmas, that was gift enough.  Jim (Dad) is an ole' hippy like me & we had long talks about many of the great classic rock bands/ those still together, those disbanded & the unfortunately passed away.<br />One night I came back in the room to sit down & saw \\"CELEBRATION DAY\\" across the screen of my television.  I figured it was Jim's copy but still....couldn't believe I was getting to watch it Right Now (I asked my son to go get & hook up my speakers; it sounded incredible!).  I started crying uncontrollably (silly, I know but I never got to see them; the year I was old enough Bonzo died).<br />I am still a big Robert Plant fan and see him in concert whenever possible.  Ok, now I'll get to it.  Christmas morning I thought I'd opened everything & they handed me a disk-shaped package from Jim.  Yes, of course it was my very own \\"Celebration Day\\".  Unfortunately he couldn't get me the Deluxe but it's great for now.  There is no question any fan of Zep/ any rock MUST HAVE THIS :)
B000VOC90Y|2.0|Will try to keep it short.<br /><br />Pros- many pockets, many pouches,not an eyesore it is pretty low profile, fit a HP probook4730 (just barely).<br />thought i loved it, that brings me to cons.<br /><br />Cons-broken zipper almost immediately<br /><br />Opened it, my laptop fit, score. Went to stash the power supply cord in another of the many compartments, hey this zipper isnt very smooth, it should be smooth for a 60+ dollar bag. Maybe it will break in after a few zips, that seems reasonable. Nope it did not break in it just broke.<br /><br />It seemed like a nice bag for 5 minutes, but for the price I want something to last a good long while.<br />Put in a return ticket a little while ago, will most likely edit once i find out how that goes.<br /><br />For now it gets 2 stars, I almost hate it, I really want to. If the zipper would have broke on my way to or from somewhere that would have secured the hate,<br />for now it will sit in its shipping box in shame.<br /><br />Thanks.
B006O6F932|3.0|This item is ok my daughter likes it cause its monster high of course.but I feel its not a steady or strong house it scratches easy and not as easy to fold back up like its suppose to.yes it's worth the money only because my daughter don't know the difference of something made good to something made bad.abd she loves it, but yes defenitly not worth money out of my pocket.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|I was very unhappy with this app.  The advertised games were not there but needed to be downloaded at a cost.  Not happy at all.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Awesome game. Especially for free. Really worth it.  It's fun to slaughter waves of zombies gradually upgrading your guy, attacks,and troops.
1451695195|5.0|THIS IS REALLY A WONDERFUL BOOK TO READ<br />I'M ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH AT THE MOMENT<br />SO I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE<br />HALF.<br />THANK YOU VERY MUCH,<br />  RICHARD.
0307275639|5.0|This is one of the most well-written and inspiring books I've ever read. I rarely read a book more than one time, but this is one I've already read twice and expect to read again when the time is appropriate.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I rate it 3 stars.<br />Kept me interested and I could not stop to return to read the next chapter.
1451629192|4.0|Although I reviewed A Stolen Life before beginning to read it, I am now about 50 pages into the book. I have suddenly encountered a repetition of pages (approximately 10-12). This interrupted the flow of the story; therefore, I hope it's a one-time occurrence in the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An exciting and thrilling sequel to the hunger games.  Can't wait to begin the third book to find out Peeta's fate and the outcome of the rebellion!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a really great game with amazing details and graphics! But what can you say, just another great game from game loft.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Kept me interested. . .a different type of fairy tale. Easy to read. . .relatable character's.  Well thought out storyline.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Jack Reacher never fails to amaze me. As usual Lee Child keeps your interest and as usual it's very hard to put the book down.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm hoping for the next one soon. Rick riordan!!
0060872675|5.0|my three children are married now & two have children of their own & the third has my next grandchild is on the way.<br />this book was bought for my son's to read to their children each day so they have a special part of every day that is &#34;da time&#34;.<br />Some things are beyond important ...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Completely intriguing. I literally could not put it down. Awesome! Can't wait for Entwined in you in May. This series makes you feel so involved
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|This is just another crap let's-cash-in-on-a-classic part of a franchise.  Lot's of money and talent was poured into this effort with a so-so waste coming out of the spout.  Good special effects that don't really mean all that much in the end.  Story didn't strike me as particularly interesting.  I could have had a perfectly fine life without having seen this movie, but seeing it didn't ruin my life either.  It just wasted my time.<br /><br />I know.  This is a halfhearted review, but it's all I need to say about PROMETHEUS.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|As you hit the glowing white ball into your opponent's goal, you will ask yourself, \\"Why didn't I get this game earlier?\\" Because you are missing out if you don't get it. It is, after all, pretty awesome. I mean, when you can play by yourself, with other people, and play in championships, you'll have trouble putting it down, I guarantee.
B0086700CM|4.0|I just started playing Temple Run yesterday. It's a bit of a throw-back to the Pitfall game from Activision, but with modern 3d graphics. I have to say, although there's not a whole lot of variety, it is fun and hard to put down.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As we all know, Mockingjay, by Suzanne Collins, is a rather popular book due to the earlier books in the Hunger Games series. But popularity does not ensure good literature. (For example, we all remember when the Twilight saga was popular, and how that turned out.) However, even though, as a fifth grader, I find it hard not to love the books I read, there were a few points in this book where I felt like I was only reading it to get through it, which was kind of disappointing. But it was well described and beautifully thought out, especially towards the ending where the true meaning of the stories come into view. Interesting, touching, and though my star rating might tell you otherwise, a book not to miss.
0670023329|5.0|I did not receive the book.  But, I did read it elsewhere and it was a must read on a place we need to hear more about.  It is a remarkable odyssey and was happy to purchase copy for local library.<br /><br />I am assuming the book was good quality as it was shipped directly to county library.
0446554995|2.0|I read through the Pendergast series finding the books -first- amateurish, then extremely interesting albeit fantastic and -lastly- lame. Two graves just gave the series a down-the-drain finale.<br /><br />The plot borders on being CHILDlish (forced by the author's surname perhaps?), certainly preposterous and obnoxiously rambling. The book is filled --littered, more accurately- with long, useless and ultimately opaque descriptions, that leave the reader lost and confuse.<br /><br />A fatal and inevitable ending that could not be resolved in fierce battle, defused by a lame piece of speech two sentences long? What kind of stupid readers is this aimed at? If I was expecting a decent closure to the dwindling series, whose characters had obviously exhausted themselves several issues ago, I was force fed something seemingly written by a high-school kid for feeble minded peers.<br /><br />The two sidebar stories, highly promising in themselves and probably more interesting than the main one, were left unattended and, more so, thrown in as, what, a filler? page count padding? They are so totally unrelated that the reader can jump the over the chapters and end up with the same main plot intact.<br /><br />Fare thee well Preston & Child. For serial character based novels I shall go back to solid writers like namesake Lee Child, David Downing, Philip Kerr, Michael Connelly and John Sanford.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|Movie was too short and felt rushed. It could have used a better back story and plot. I hope they continue franchise though.
1594487154|5.0|If you've always hated the idea of \\"selling\\" because it feels slimy and pushy, Dan Pink has another one of his surprising revelations for you: you're right.<br /><br />Selling, or more precisely, moving others, is a human activity. We all do it, all the time. It turns out that the techniques which are effective at getting kids to do their homework or your significant other to watch that amazing movie they're not sure they wanna see -- that's all the right stuff for selling, too.<br /><br />Pink teaches us about attunement, buoyancy, and clarity, the new ABCs of selling. He explains in simple terms, backed by solid psychology, why listening and caring matter more than pushing; how to stay afloat emotionally in an ocean of rejection, and why the elevator pitch is dead, long live its 6 successors.<br /><br />I hate selling. So does every entrepreneur I know.<br /><br />This book will change all that, by showing us how to move others to action (whether it's selling, or what Pink calls non-sales selling, the endless persuasive efforts involved in everyday life) and how to do it like a human being, with generosity and good old common sense.<br /><br />Put away the plaid polyester sports coat. This isn't your father's Oldsmobile sale.
0061692042|5.0|A number of things stated by other reviewers about Richard Ford's CANADA are true: Ford does have a habit of repeating -- or having his narrator repeat -- information or observations. And the pacing is not brisk.<br /><br />But this is a case where the whole is far more than the sum of its parts. CANADA is a compelling, beautifully written tale of a young man wrested from his life by the wrong-headed actions of his foolish parents and thrust into another life where he will observe the fatally misguided conduct of yet another adult.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1960s Montana and western Canada, the two settings connected by two unrelated acts of violence, and Ford uses the isolation and bleakness of the setting to show the actions of his characters in high relief. I have read other Ford books, about unhappy men in barren lives, and the barrenness of the landscape in CANADA is misleading: this is a masterful book, with memorable if heartbreaking characters and a beautiful reflection on life and the way unexpected or unplanned incident can change our life course forever.<br /><br />I was not put off by Ford's \\"foreshadowing\\" of events -- he doesn't foreshadow them, he tells us what will happen. What happens to the other characters in the book is not the point of the story. How these things affect young Dell Parsons is the point.<br /><br />An evocative and strangely beautiful book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie rocks on every level. Great casting, writing, direction, effects, acting - it's transcendent of the 'superhero' genre.  And finally, finally, finally they got The Hulk right!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Tame Impala - Lonerism<br /><br />  Kevin Parker just keeps getting better and better and better all the time .  Lonerism is the 2012 release that is one of my favourite albums of 2012 !  With all songs written and mostly played by Kevin Parker, \\"Lonerism\\" is a strong follow up to the mind bending debut Inner Speaker album which I loved.<br /><br /> Kind of interesting that he writes and plays most of the instruments and the album is called \\"Lonerism\\" eh !<br /><br />  Tame Impala is an imaginary world where the Beatles meet XTC and you might just think that Andy Partridge just took a Magical Mystery Tour!.<br /><br />  \\"Lonerism\\" is a much more synthesizer infused album than the heavy guitar laden debut album.  There is still lots of guitar on this album too but just seems less pronounced to me.  No question Kevin Parker has a John Lennon-themed voice and at times you kind of do a double take on his voice.........<br /><br />  Lonerism is really a fun album of 12 pop-psych infused songs that definitely take you on a musical  adventure.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Nolan's Batman run and this was a great movie. But in the theater, I have to say that I was disappointed with the improbable scale of the second half of the movie. It was impossible to suspend my disbelief, and I really wish they hadn't used Manhattan as Gotham - bad location choice. The idea that the island of Manhattan could be taken hostage for months is ludicrous.<br /><br />Watching it again on DVD was a breath of fresh air. I knew what I was going to witness and was able to suspend my disbelief, and just enjoy the movie.  Much better the second time around.
B0072V394E|4.0|This is a great movie. I will recommend this movie to anyone. A great performance by Franco Nero. Well done.
B005Q1W0ZQ|2.0|Contrary to two reviewers' published comments, this version -- the UK version -- does NOT include the Christmas episode. Only the US version has this special episode. I am in the process of returning the UK version to the very cooperative and helpful seller. If the information had been correct this would be a 5 star review.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Very good Green Day album.  Way to end this trilogy! I really enjoy all the songs on this album.  Nice
B0036OS3G0|5.0|I bought these boots for a ski trip to wear around the town and so far they've been great. They're super lightweight, so very practical for traveling. They're very warm, have walked through snow without socks and my feet have remained warm. Best of all, after wearing ski boots they're a welcome relief as they feel like you're wearing nothing. I haven't had any problems with them getting wet, and of course they're easy on, easy off.
B000B8QF14|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CD/DVD,,, I JUST LOVE THIS GROUP...

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  I am most anxiously awaiting the next one in what I think might be a trilogy.  If so, I will definitely be reading all of them.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I would like it so much more if it allowed more than 56 pieces!  I deliberately got it from Amazon rather than the play store but still won't allow more pieces.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|To call this movie \\"awful\\" would be a compliment.  I like Seth McFarland, although even some of his jokes on \\"Family Guy\\" can go a little too far for my taste.  McFarland did the voice of Ted, but it sounded like Peter (dad in Family Guy), so that was distracting throughout the whole movie.  But it was the crude jokes and language that went way too far for me.  I especially didn't appreciate the gay bashing or the \\"retard\\" reference.  I kept thinking it would get better, but that never happened.  Nothing made me laugh or even crack a smile.  It's a shame I watched this movie because it has really turned me off on McFarland now.
0061906220|4.0|This is a really great preschool book.  We bought this book, along with the Pete the Cat stuffed animal, for our 4 year old.  He adores his Pete and &#34;reads&#34; this book to him all the time!
081299471X|3.0|I'm still working my way through this, but I have a stubborn bias against fiction that on its surface is inherently difficult to read. What's the point of that? To differentiate it from genre bestsellers? To advertise the cleverness of the author? Why do you need a Ph.D. (which I happen to have) to enjoy a novel? Can't a novel be intellectually compelling without being in the form of a puzzle or a labyrinth? Ultimately, all literary judgments are questions of personal taste, and so is this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good, I would recommend to anybody who loves to read. As soon as I started reading I was unable to to put it down.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing! You can understand the characters well, and you grow a strong connection to them. Biggest. Cliffhanger. Ever.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Would have loved to have seen this on the big screen and in 3D, too!  It was definitely worth the cost!
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Start with Grace Kelly, James Stewart, the inimitable Thelma Ritter, Raymond Burr and Wendell Corey.  Add the whole Fifties thing.  Get totally into voyeurism as you watch other people's everyday lives in a hot Manhattan summer, all from an apartment window. It's classic Hitchcock. Not a thriller by today's standards, but you'll care how it ends.  Special effects at one point are lame compared to today's film technology, but you just have to accept it as part of the package.  It's one of my favorites.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Excellent movie-captivating because it had a few important differences between it and the original movie. I liked the differences even tho I am a big fan of the original cast. Cast did a superb job.
B008J05EL8|1.0|When you buy a product you expect it to be complete.... no extra charges for things that should be included LIKE FONTS! To add insult to injury you get only a few fonts with your additional purchase... BUT YOU GET WINGDINGS! EVERONE uses those! Really? The Office Suite Pro is just a big fat turd and the requirement that you pay extra for the use of fonts that should be included with it only add to the stench of the product! You are better served using Kingsoft Office for android and the price is better! NO HIDDEN CHARGES!
0545323126|4.0|I got the first 5 books in the series in paperback for $30, in which is decent price for the product. As for the series, each book is written in journal format with cartoon drawings. A quite unique setting for a comedy. The series follows story of the main character Greg Heffley's life and his struggle as a middle school student, middle kid in the family or hopeless individual who tries to fit in. All the stories happened in the book are not meant to taken literally, they're what I consider twisted version of reality. It is certainly not educational. This is a pure comedy. I'm sure a lot of teachers, parents or kids share the similar concerns like the book, however, which family doesn't have a few of problems? That's why I like this series, it's really about a big dysfunctional family. Personally, sometimes, I felt like this is a list of complaints from a kid's perspective.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Purchased as a gift along with seasons one and two and my daughter was thrilled to get them all! She loves the series and can now watch when she wants to.
B0045NDVFE|4.0|Really liked most of the songs quite a bit. Great harmonies, instrumentals come through. I think this music could be performed live and sound just as good, unlike most of today's popular music. And you can even sing along to it... Congrats to The Band Perry.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|My kids love the super hero movies and this did not disappoint. It was a Christmas day hit. I got it for a great price too.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I bought this for my 17 year old, but all of my kids (ages 15-23) love the Doctor Who series.
1451695187|5.0|From the perspective of somebody also in medicine, this is one of the few NDE books out there that approaches the subject as objectively as possible. Dr. Alexander writes about his experience objectively, and also documents his medical condition so that those of us in the medical community cannot dismiss his experience as just a &#34;dumping&#34; of neurotransmitters into his brain. He goes into depth into both sides of the NDE, explaining the lack of a clear medical cause for his experience describing the inability of his cortex to function (which is responsible for higher level functioning, and for what some describe a consciousness) and also detailing what he experienced without a religious lens.<br /><br />His career as a very accomplished neurosurgeon in the highest echelons of academic medicine give this book even more weight and is a book that I highly recommend to those that may have lost loved ones, as I recently have.<br /><br />My apologies for the brief review.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Purchased as a gift along with seasons one and three and my daughter was thrilled to get them all! She loves the series and can now watch when she wants to.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy never dissapoints with another great addition to the series. I love hearing about the near factual aspects of us interacting with our worldly neighbors.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This flash works great with my D60. I also have a diffuser unit which I use with the flash most of the time - no harsh shadows and the flash has plenty of power for most room shots.<br />Before I used the diffuser, I used the bounce off the ceiling and that worked most of the time; but I would need to adjust the angle to get the right results.<br />The cycle time is very good and the communication with the camera is excellent.

B008D28HYS|5.0|The addition of color makes solving these puzzles a different experience. I have to work on at least two or three at each time I play with the Kindle Fire. This is one of the best. Highly recommended.

1401322786|5.0|My fiance gave me this book for Christmas and I have to admit, I was skeptical. I'm more of a murder mystery/tragic love story type of person. Once I began reading, however, it instantly grabbed my attention and I finished the book in two days. First, it's really well-written and an easy, elegant read. Second, the stories reflect what is happening in the most recent years, including all that nonsense about the Mayan calendar. We've all had those moments of wanting to be able to control time. While we can't abandon how to world works according to time, this story is about appreciating the time that we have on this earth and having faith that your life, however long or however short, has meaning and purpose. It's also a tale about how to think of yourself as connected to all those around you, even if you don't know everyone, and that you are never completely alone, that you are loved and needed in ways you may not even realize. I think those concepts are all worth knowing and remembering, especially in times when things can look so bleak. Great story.
1594135592|2.0|Agree with the other reviewers that this book was way too long, overly cliched, hackneyed, and generally poorly executed.<br /><br /> I couldn't help but think how cool it would've been to have Jake Epping stop the infamous Clutter murders (which of course were chronicled in Capote's classic \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  The timing was nearly perfect: the Clutter family was murdered in November 1959, and Epping starts his time-travel \\"voyage\\" in September 1958. After saving the Clutters, he could've maybe taken Jack Kerouac to some AA meetings. Or convinced Buddy Holly and the gang to go by bus to the next gig. King choose the dullest ways humanely possible to pass the 5 years from 1959 to 1963. Yawn.<br /><br /> Adding a second \\"historical\\" murder-prevention would've been much more interesting than the contrived nonsense with the fictional crippled janitor and the crippled hunting-accident girl. It would've been a great side-story and much better than dancing lessons and being a freakin' SUBSTITUTE TEACHER in Texas for pages, and pages, and pages.........I'm surprised no one mentioned Jake's annoying habit of correcting the student's grammar during conversations like some stuffy old Grandma. The more I reflect on it, the more putrid and downright awful this monster was to slog through. It sorely needed an editor's red pen (or maybe an editors paper shredder, now that I think about it).<br /><br /> I can't help thinking that if this story was submitted by a newbie/unknown novelist as a first effort, it wouldn't have gotten a second look.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|He's my favorite artist and I'm very, very happy that he finally made a Christmas Album.  He made great choices of songs.
B005HSL626|4.0|Its a good game to pass some time. The features are good and you can switch which swords you use.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple, very strait forward game. Reminds me of the old Windows version. My favourite part is the undo button for the impulse moves. Wish real life had one of those ;)
B0060D15AK|3.0|I don't know.  I haven't got the movie yet!  I would love to rate this but I don't have the movie yet!
B003274QH6|4.0|...however interestingly, I left off for a couple of seasons, came back, and it was as though the series picked right up where it left off.  That is the core, the teacher 'Breaking Bad', the slow, easy migration into his new self, living a life he never intended. That which I missed was easily made up for by quickly adapting to their latest endeavors, and projecting what must have happened (which is not earth-shattering) while I took a break.<br /><br />I never got used to his partner in crime, something just doesn't work for me there. But the series has enough depth and subplots so that to some extent he's tolerable.
0553801473|3.0|Despite the widely varying opinions on the book, I think the 3 stars the reviews have settled on gets it right. All those complaints about a lack of resolution? They're dead on. Dance with Dragons is well written and enjoyable, but I did feel let down by it.<br /><br />It's not that I, or, I suspect, the other readers who've voiced similar complaints, expected all of our questions answered, but a book that devotes so much time to characters going to a particular location (Mereen) and talking about the cool stuff that's gonna happen when they get there, shouldn't end with those same characters still traveling and talking about what will happen when...<br />That's why people say nothing happens in this book. It creates the expectation that Victarion Greyjoy (remember him from book 4?) will get to Mereen and encounter Daenerys. Never happens. Victarion is still sailing by the end, 959 pages later. If the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, moved at this pace, Ned Stark would never have arrived at Kings Landing.<br /><br />Some of the best chapters in ADWD involve characters who get the least page time, like Arya, Bran, Sersei, and Theon. Having Bran go from an equally important character to a 3-chapter afterthought was particularly frustrating, as he actually got where he was going, and where he goes is COOL. Cersei still doesn't have her trial unfortunately, but her few scenes are compelling.<br /><br />There are 13 Tyrion chapters in ADWD, and for all his amusing adventures, none of it moves the plot forward significantly, and by the end he's doing the same thing he was at the beginning.<br /><br />John's story -- also 13 chapters -- feels even less eventful. When something finally does happen, it comes out of the blue, and it's over and done in less than half a page.<br /><br />The third most featured character, Daenerys, spends much of the book caught up in bureaucratic wrangling. Ugh. Hope you paid attention to all the names of the different sword companies and their leaders from ASOS. There will be a test. It's called A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />HOWEVER, all these criticisms didn't put me off continuing to read the series. I still love it and I eagerly await the next installment.<br /><br />Although...<br /><br />I just watched George R. R. Martin on youtube reading an excerpt from the as-yet-unfinished 6th book. It was a Victarion chapter. He's still on his boat, doing the same sorts of things he did in the last book, talking about what he was gonna do when he gets where he's going. It didn't inspire confidence.
B0000026UV|5.0|Produced by Mark Knopfler, this album (even to a jazz lover like me) is a real \\"feel-good\\" piece of work. The guitar work of Chet Atkins has that very special sound that made him a legend. The arrangements are wonderful; the interplay between the men a real treat. There are also a number of vocals where the guys harmonize, & a couple of solo outings by Mark on a couple.<br /><br />The tune that really surprised me was the totally instrumental on \\"I'll see you in my dreams.\\" They have a bass & drums with them, & each shows a moving approach to the tune. Mark does the single note solo work with Chet's unmistakeable classical influence in his playing, both in accompaniment & as a soloist. In \\"The Next time I'm in town,\\" they take a solo vocal approach for a chorus which I found charming.<br /><br />Other favs on the album are \\"Poor Boy Blues,\\"Just one time.\\"  I recommend this album very highly, & if you get it, I promise you'll like it as much as I. Thanks for reading my review.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It is just as told in the popular visual media tales but has the richness of DIckens portayal and pace.

B004HD61KE|5.0|THIS WAS A FAST PACED, EXCITING NOVEL.  THE CHARACTERS WERE. BELIEVABLE, AND WELL INTERWOVEN.  A WELL WRITTEN MIX OF HISTORY, REALITY, AND FICTION.

0547884591|4.0|A very unorthodox path to learning and appreciating the finer points of culinary art. Ferriss's book is intriquing in that it is not just about recipes,  but about challenging the fears and untrodden paths one encounters in life. Having read the whole book and digested its many sections,(excuse the play on words), I appreciate the emphasis on &#34;Less, done well, is more&#34; which keys his recipes which only incorporate a few ingredients with maximum effect, to learning mind games involving basketball 3 pointers, memorizing decks of cards, as well as highlighting the challenges of a dinner party with friends. Having already accumulated a small library of culinary digests, I am going to keep this on the shelf for cross reference and a handy meal conversation piece.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I really enjoy books like this. Kind of magic and not.I havent finished this book but when I do I will order the second one!
B000F8O35U|1.0|this is a pirated version of the movie. No meneus and the bonus disc doesnt work at all. Very unhappy
030759565X|4.0|I like Deb's blog so I was pretty sure I'd like her book and I do. It's a great read as well as a cookbook. Lots of easy, delicious recipes. I actually bought this book as a gift and a few days later my brother sent me my own copy so guess he likes it too.
B009CG29RK|5.0|The soundtrack is awesome - Pharrell did a GREAT job.  The movie is engaging enough for both adults and children so that it's a joy to watch over and over - which your children will undoubtedly have you doing.  The Minions are adorable, as are the three girls and of course even Kyle and Gru come around and have changes of heart.  Awesome, sweet, funny, family movie.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I am rating the product and notthe quality of the voices. Cameron Mackintosh: I do not like being swindled. Yes, I spent $5.00 on this soundtrack, but on iTunes it's $15 and its a HIGHLIGHTS track. Most of the best songs are left out and now, whenever you deign to release the full soundtrack, I'll just have to buy it again. You should know that you don't need to swindle money from us.<br /><br />At least give us the date that you'll release the full album. Get with the program. We are not amused.<br /><br />But good job on the film.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This game is awesome! I had loved Hello Kitty forever! I had searched &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; in the App Store and this came up. :) I love it so much! It is very fun. You rush to serve your customers, then at the end of the day, you can decorate your resteraunt. I reccomend this app for HK lovers! Enjoy! :)
B0094K1K42|2.0|I watch movies purely for entertainment and don't worry much about who directed it etc.<br />This movie was really slow, boring, and character development wasn't great.  I found myself picking up a word search and doing other things while watching.<br />I wouldn't recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My sister had recently downloaded this app and she is already obsessed with it!! She plays it all the time! I had recently downloaded it myself. It is very fun, but you gotta learn technique! Hope you will enjoy this app like my sister and I do! :)

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The movie is a bit of a downer,  3/4 of the way through it starts getting a little better.  More on the serious side and less on the funny side.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to play on my Kindle Fire HD, only wish you could turn off the ads that pop up when you start a new game.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I didn't really know what it was about ahead of time, maybe if I knew more what I was up for it would've been funnier.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Every time the game gets interupted, by a phone call for example, you have to force close the game because when it returns to the game, after the phone call, the game is all glitchy and impossible to play...<br /><br />Reminds me of the old NES games when it would get all these glitchy blocks on the screen, and you'd have to blow the dust out of the game cartridge and the NES console itself...<br /><br />I just don't know which end of my phone to blow into...??? Or maybe I need to have the dev blow into his computer? I don't know. I'm confused here... I miss my old 1980's technology. Things made sense back then! Lol
B001VFTYWI|3.0|I enjoy the books and look forward to continuing the story. It's now like reading about a friend.<br />Wonderful &#34;Who done it&#34; reading for pleasure. Wow! What would Perry Mason have done with<br />Kay on his team?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was very well written, and while its for adolescents, its themes are very adult. No point in the story lags, and I felt compelled to read until exhaustion, hunger or work forced me to stop. I highly recommend this book to teens ages 15 to 99!!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Watched this movie on Amazon Prime three times in 48-hours - so funny!  My daughter is only 8 and this is PG-13.  I watched it first and then deemed it pretty safe for her to watch.  Then we watched it together twice.  I will definitely purchase this movie. I was told if you like Glee, you will like this.  I don't like Glee but I still loved this movie.  The songs were fun and entertaining and it was a fun movie.

B005VPRET4|5.0|At first my 8-year old daughter was overwhelmed.  I started to build it and as she saw it forming, she got more interested.  The instructions in the book are real simple so once I showed her how to follow-them and she saw it forming into the cafe she really loved it and at the end she was very proud of herself.  A big confidence builder.  This was her first time building legos from a kit and it was a succcess.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love seeing this movie every Christmas holiday!  It depicts hiliarious family dynamics and all those crazy relatives that you really don't want to be around.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|If you've got a choice, why anyone would watch the American version of this is beyond me!  While channel surfing before I went to bed one night, I ACCIDENTALLY caught this on television late one night, could only watch maybe 15 minutes of it because I was so tired....as I said, late night!  From just the opening credits you sit there kind of mesmerized, watching that little casket travel around, smirking to yourself thinking WTH?!?!?  So because of the first 15 minutes I decided I had to buy it, if it was funny in the first 15 minutes it had to be funny throughout!  I was not disappointed!  I bought it to take to the beach for my sister and I to watch...I was a bit nervous about all the language, but everytime I looked over at her she had her hand to her mouth trying to keep from laughing at the pure hilarity of it all!  You are just mortified for the poor family but you can't help but laugh about all the goings on!  I do, indeed, love British humour so I found it truly hysterical....I will pull it out time and again to watch when I need a laugh!  As a matter of fact, my sister has requested it for our NEXT beach vacation...LOL!
B000I0QL82|3.0|If you like the concept of White Christmas and the classical musical genre, then you should like this.  But it is not White Christmas.  I thought Holiday Inn was ok,; my mom kinda hated it.  I appreciate a 1940's musical, love these cast members but didn't like Holiday Inn.  I love White Christmas and own it but Holiday Inn would be more worth a rental

B001NVIZ3E|5.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland is the BEST Robin Hood movie ever created.  Great action sequences, Claude Rains is a superbly suave villain and Basil Rathbone as a sneering Sheriff of Nottingham are just wonderful, but the lightness and humor evident throughout the film is the thing that brings it over the top!  If you've never seen it before, you have an incredible treat waiting for you, if you've seen it before, you're getting together with your BFF!  This is a good DVD treatment, I had no problems with viewing it.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Taken is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat, thriller that will hold your attention from beginning to end. Liam Neeson's portrayal of a father out to rescue his kidnapped daughter and get revenge from her abductors is excellent. The actors, Paris backdrop, and photography add to this heart-pumping thriller.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game.  Alot of fun and very addiciting.  Enjoy this game alot. Have not been able to put down since downloading.
1419705849|4.0|I bought this for my 11 year old son. He said he'd rate it 4.5 stars. He has the entire Wimpy Kid series and loves them all. He didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't the best of the series but said it was still very funny and good.
1451696191|1.0|I finished this book quite let down. There were chapters in the first part where his expression, his plain speaking (that I think sometimes sounded too simple) sounded like a total rip off of Holden Caulfield's sensitive, philosophical sort of style.<br /><br />But I persisted, since it's engaging to read. And before the last chapter, was glad, since how his friends and their relationships are described, I thought, was pretty vivid.<br /><br />Then it comes to the climax, in the last chapter. I knew something fairly big, some sort of revelation had to happen to end the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was brought back to finding this book just TOO much of a rip off of The Catcher in The Rye. Namely, the main character having been molested as a child.<br /><br />Holden Caulfield doesn't state this out right, I don't think. But then, The Catcher, is true originality and brilliance. Whereas this book takes that brilliance, copies it, adds some charming on their own descriptions of teen friendships (I will give it this) and really just gets rid of the mystery and subtlety whilst copying more than one key aspects of the original story anfpd book.<br /><br />Actually, having slept on this... I am actually quite disgusted by what this \\"author\\" has done, and how he's been permitted to get away with it.<br /><br />He should be sued for having stolen Salinger's character. Having read this \\"work\\" by Chbosky, I feel cheated and moreover, like my emotions have been exploited. Just as he stole the tragic history of the main character from Salinger, he's effectively used the tragedy of sexual abuse of children as a device for gaining sympathy. The fact that this was already done, and so very much more intelligently, just makes it seem like a cheap ploy.<br /><br />It is total inauthentic. It exploits J D Salinger, and insults everybody as a result.<br /><br />This novel is, in short: a pathetic, shameless copy and the \\"author\\" is a fraud.<br /><br />Nup. Can't approve of this story. It's sad, since parts of it were really well done (assuming that these were his original ideas) and I think it shows a lack of faith in his ability. It's fine to take inspiration from a classic like The Catcher in the Rye, but this crosses the line, I believe, and just borrows way too heavily from Salinger, whose book was far more  brilliant book, in it's actual originality and it's subtlety.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly's THE BLACK BOX was another installment in the fabulous Harry Bosch series.  The main plot was interesting coupled with some other subplots that gave the story an extra boost.  Figuring out the mystery of the book wasn't as important to me than just seeing how things would evolve and resolve.  I did find myself questioning some of the outcomes in the latter part of the book which slid the rating from five to four stars.  A solid book from a writing standpoint as Michael Connelly is one of the best for a quality read.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|This device adds flexibility to my devices that offer an ExpressCard 34 option.  Since this card fits fully into the ExpressCard 34 port on those devices with an ExpressCard 34 Port, I am able to leave it attached to those devices, and do not have to carry and install an external card reader to view files on the SD Cards in my library.  I find this option for reading files on SD Cards to be very useful when it's installed in my devices that support the ExpressCard 34 standard. Regretfully, like so many technology standards, it was not a widely adopted device standard among system designers/builders, so it's not universally available on computers generally.

B008JEJPSC|5.0|\\"Annie\\" has had a spotty history on home video.  Unless you were lucky enough to have a widescreen laserdisc in the 90's, or the widescreen DVD that was available shortly in the early 2000's, you've most likely only seen the film in an awful pan-and-scan presentation with 40% of the picture missing (and the opening credits squished into the frame).  And if you were lucky enough to have either of the widescreen versions, you wouldn't have the bonus features from the later full-frame \\"anniversary\\" DVD release of 2002.<br /><br />Sony has finally given \\"Annie\\" fans the presentation we have hoped for with this 30th Anniversary Blu-ray edition.  I won't go into a review of the movie; it is what it is.  But how is the Blu-ray...?<br /><br />Video<br /><br />A!  \\"Annie\\" has never looked better.  There may be a few people who saw a 70mm print in 1982, but if that isn't you, it's probable that this is the best you've ever seen.  That being said, \\"Annie\\" was filmed in the early 1980's, and so it looks like a film from the early 1980's.  A little more grain that we might be used to, but kudos to Sony for staying true to the look of the film and not trying to eliminate the grain with over processing.  The picture is sharp and natural, with the orphanage scenes looking suitably drab and monotone, and the mansion scenes nicely detailed.  Watching it with my daughters (who have only seen the widescreen DVD), there were several scenes where they said \\"I never noticed (insert detail here)!\\"  That's a sure sign of a good presentation.  There will no doubt be some flaws that are noticed for the first time (several scenes exhibit an odd oversaturation on the light bulbs in the mansion, which I suspect are in the film source), but all in all the HD video is superb, and sure to please any fan.<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />A+!  The English audio is presented in DTS MA 5.1, (not Dolby Digital 5.1), and again, it has never sounded better.  From start to finish, the sound is full and rich, with good use of all channels. Even my subwoofer got a workout, with the bottom-end of the musical numbers shaking the room. Rumor has it that some 70mm theatrical presentations had \\"directional dialogue\\" (where the voices follow the actors across the front speakers), but that is not the case here (it is always from the center channel, as is now common).<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />Yes, there are extras on this disc.  It includes the \\"My Hollywood Adventure\\" with Aileen Quinn, a 12 minute featurette from 2002 where she shares her memories of getting the part of Annie and filming the movie.  It is very well done, with some good archival and behind the scenes footage.  In the absence of a more in depth documentary, this will have to do.  The Blu-ray also includes the music video for a contemporary pop version of \\"Hard Knock Life\\" by the group \\"Play\\", whom Wikipedia informs me was a Swedish girl group from the early 2000s (both the \\"My Hollywood Adventure\\" and music video are from the 2002 DVD).<br /><br />There is a good presentation of vintage \\"Annie\\" trailers and TV commercials from 1982; two trailers and three commercials.  Frankly, the trailers are pretty bad, even judging by the standards of 30 years ago.  But it's great to have them here.<br /><br />This disc does not have the \\"Act Along With Annie\\" or Trivia game from the 2002 release, or the \\"Original Movie Art Gallery\\" or \\"Talent Files\\" from the widescreen DVD release.<br /><br />There is also a \\"Sing Along Blu-ray Exclusive\\", which I didn't look at, and a trailer for \\"Arthur Saves Christmas\\".<br /><br />Thanks to Sony for giving us such a great version of this oft maligned film.  My biggest complaint is that they didn't put chapter stops at the beginning of the songs, which should be standard practice for any Blu-ray musical!  But now we can watch ET, Annie and Tron on Blu-ray and show our kids why it was so awesome to be 8-years-old in the summer of 1982.

B008XOXGCO|3.0|I really liked \\"Science and faith,\\" Irish trio The Script's second album. There was just the right balance of anthemic pop and modern rock/rap to keep a balance. On #3, the rapping overwhelms. The album tends to bland out after the first few songs and the stronger singles. \\"Hall Of Fame\\" drew me in when it was used on the World Series' baseball commercials, and it sounded like the band was once again going to hit the right notes. But the lyrics/raps are loaded with cliches, the rapping is excruciatingly monochromatic, and only \\"If You Could See Me Now,\\" lead singer  Danny O'Donoghue's ode to his dead father, has the emotional wallop of anything from \\"Science and Faith.\\"<br /><br />I'll also give a tip of the hat to \\"Kaleidoscope,\\" which grapples with a U2 sound and \\"Glowing,\\" which is a well structured piano rocker minus the annoying rapping. That makes four songs I like on an album of 10; not a good batting average. #3 is not a bad album, just an average one, slickly produced and full of confidence, but just feels like a step in the wrong direction for The Script.

0307596885|3.0|I found Alice Munro's latest collection of autobiographical fragments, so called short stories, less than enthralling.  They are more random sketches, without chronology or aesthetic unity rather than coherent stories with a beginning, middle and end.  Set in a small town in Western Ontario, they attempt the difficult fictional task of representing `real life' in all its unpredictability. After all, like history, life is just one darned thing after another. Often the anecdotes read as mere autobiographical jottings with no unifying point of view or stable protagonist.  Thus the first story `To Reach Japan' introduces the reader to Peter on board a train after having brought his wife Greta to the station with her case.  He is happy to jump off the train and wave to her with an enigmatic smile to his daughter Katy. We are then told that Peter's father died in a sanatorium before he could get him out of Soviet Czechoslovakia, and then how his mother survived in British Columbia and brought Peter up to be an engineer.  Peter's scientific education, however, has a cramping effect upon him. When Peter has business elsewhere, Greta, a poet, and Katy house sit for one of Greta's friends in Vancouver, where the poet is invited to a party of literati in North Vancouver.  At first she feels an outsider, but later meets what seems to be her soul mate, a reporter named Harris Bennett.  But they lose touch, he goes to Toronto and Greta pines.  We then focus on the Greta-Katy relationship and the daughter's ability to socialise with other children.  Meanwhile Greta runs into Greg, with whom she strikes up a friendship and makes love.  But during this Katy gets lost and Greta becomes distraught. All this we now find is happening on the train Peter vacated.  The third person narrator's story, such as it is, has a happy ending. But whither Japan?  Shsh, Japan is a metaphor for escape and adventure. It's a poet's response to an engineer.

Oliver and the Professor laugh off the chill that seems to come from the painting as they discuss it's strange history.  Soon after a tragic series events places the painting in Oliver's possession.  Little does Oliver know that hatred is timeless and ever in search of a new victim....<br /><br />---------<br /><br />This is a short book that grabbed my attention and didn't let go until I finished it. In one sitting.  When I started it I knew something bad was coming and the story builds it up bit by bit until there is, I won't say shocking, but definitely a bit chilling climax that leaves you wondering if the painting and the person behind it were finally thwarted.<br /><br />Saying much more would give away a great ghost / suspense story.  So if you like ghost, suspense, mystery stories that build up the dread slowly and leave you wondering a little bit at the end I would definitely give this one a read. m.a.c

B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these for my son and he had this to say about them: \\"I was looking for something that covered my ears, and not just bashed them in. These fit perfectly over my ears and provide great comfort while gaming. I haven't heard for myself how good the sound quality is from the mic, but I've been told that it sounds good over skype from my gamer friends. I can't find anything bad about them, except for the fact that the packaging took ages to cut through!\\"
B0038BBA4I|3.0|I usually turn up the volume on the radio when I hear them play Mumford & Sons because the singles are really great. And it's great to have the album to listen to the singles whenever I want. However, a lot of the songs sounded the same to me and ran together.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|We weren't sure what to expect when we ordered this movie, but one of our sons had said he really enjoyed it.  So did we!  The characters were engaging, the story was most unusual, the scenery was lovely and it had a feel good ending, which is something we all need in these trying times.  I would definitely recommend it as a don't miss.

1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink's new book, To Sell is Human (TSIH) is about \\"moving\\" people, as he says. I'm sure there was a good reason for the choice of the word \\"sell\\" rather than \\"move\\" in the book's title. Traditional selling, as Dan compellingly argues, is a subset of the broader \\"moving\\" activity that concerns itself with influencing, persuading and changing the minds of others - an activity that we are all engaged in.<br /><br />TSIH is a collection of so many things, and can address diverse concerns and viewpoints.  Dan Pink has been very successful with his previous books and I believe that this one, if anything, will surpass the others because of its broader appeal to ... well, almost anyone. His writing style is simple and conversational. He sketches like an artist, and then fills it in with color drawn from research and studies. In many places, it reads like a novel.  It is easy reading but it sells - a good example of the very skill that it seeks to impart.<br /><br />I enjoyed many things about the book, and was left wanting more. But there is only so much that an author can put into a couple of hundred pages. However, there are several departure points that can lead to hours of surfing through the source references detailed in the book.<br /><br />The numerous off-the-beaten-path trails that TSIH mentions in passing are delectable - such as the online test that helps you calibrate yourself with regard to the mix of extravert and introvert traits that make up your personality. It's all in context of course: Dan makes the case (using actual social sciences studies), that \\"Ambiverts\\" -  those who are in touch both with themselves and with those they come in contact with - are the \\"Goldilocks\\" personalities, who shine in the art of engaging and moving others.<br /><br />There are deeper points of wisdom in these pages. It is all too easy to use simplistic thinking while discussing automation, offshoring and the leveling enabled by the Internet, and conclude that the salesperson will be disintermediated by these trends.  Dan thinks through and researches the implications of these trends with some diligence and perspicacity.  The book makes good use of statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as from studies conducted by social scientists, to paint a somewhat contrarian picture. TSIH asserts that selling has extended its tentacles well beyond the stereotypical Fuller salesman over whose head you can almost visualize the nasty word-cloud that came out of a survey and is sketched out in the book. As one would expect, the survey respondents tend to use choice epithets such as \\"pushy\\", \\"sleazy\\" and \\"annoying\\" to describe salespeople and what they do. There was a reference to a movie (Glengarry Glen Ross) in the book that does a pretty good job of bringing the stereotype to life (I took the suggestion and watched the movie and could not help thinking, \\"Does traditional sales really turn human beings into these creatures?\\").<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about the book is its outlining of three important trends, that, together, provide a simple framework that helps in understanding where corporations, industries and the world are headed: Enterpreneurship (smaller companies and self-employed people), \\"Ed-Med\\" (the rapid rise of these sectors) and \\"elasticity\\" (all of us are compelled to do more things, including selling, as the traditional enterprise continues its flattening trend).<br /><br />TSIH has also taken the traditional \\"ABC\\" (Always Be Closing) of sales, and reformulated the acronym and invested it with a new framework for thinking about the attributes that enable the task of moving: Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity.  One can argue that frameworks are simplistic and skirt or suppress important aspects of the problem space.  However, it's the price one pays for bootstrapping the cognitive process. I can say that I find the framework helpful in bringing focus to aspects of selling that are critical. TSIH does backup these conceptual sketches with social sciences studies, which lend them credibility.  There are also numerous little anecdotes and \\"hmmm\\" moments that are treats for a hungry reader.<br /><br />For people, who would put these ideas to immediate practical use, there are exercises and tactics that they may find valuable. For example, there is a technique (\\"discussion map\\") that helps in analyzing and understanding the dynamics involved in a meeting.  This can be useful for people who are interested in improving teamwork and communication.  There is also help for those who would like to craft pithy pitches for their products or services to make them hit the mark. In today's attention-deficit world, anything that helps bring succinctness to messaging is of value.<br /><br />The last part of the book brings an ethical tone into an activity stereotyped as having a marked absence of ethics. Making things purposeful and personal can make a difference to oneself and to others, argues TSIH. Just as hacking has resulted in the discipline of \\"ethical hacking\\", selling, too, may be attracting a new breed of people who move others, but do so in an ethical and mutually beneficial way. Selling needs to become more aware of the human beings on both sides of the transaction.<br /><br />(I received an early copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.)

1439153663|5.0|A gripping bit of historical fiction!  This book moves quickly, has wonderfully developed characters and a believable story line.  I stayed up much too late on many nights reading this book.  Book contains some imagery that may be difficult for some readers, but these parts are important to the story.  This is a book that I would read again.

0670024813|5.0|Like &#34;Edward Hopper in Vermont&#34; reviewed earlier, Jared Diamond's new book, The World Until Yesterday, is also endowed with a series of gorgeous photographs that depict the author's themes and preoccupations.  At least one of them - a photograph explaining why contemporary Westerners gravitate toward obesity while traditional societies have mostly slender inhabitants - is likely to give readers a belly aching laugh. There is a deeper lesson from this one picture, it's clear the author's aim is to create a readable document, not one that is so clogged with statistics that it becomes impenetrable.<br /><br />Professor Diamond's main argument is that traditional societies and &#34;advanced&#34; Western ones learn from each other, absorb and assimilate the customs and cultures of each other in a way that will better serve their interests.  That's why, he notes, urban American gangs don't resolve all their disputes in courts, but instead rely on traditional methods of crisis resolution with negotiation, intimidation, and war.  It's also the reason members of traditional societies like the ones he observed in New Guinea now have learned to travel broadly, use computers, and wear variations of Western clothing.<br /><br />The tone of the book is understated rather than preachy, and delivered in a relaxed conversational style.  The author likes to let one thing stand for the whole, as when he writes that Harvard University lost a great deal of it's endowment funds during the recent financial debacle.  It is well documented that many of Harvard's peer group did as well.  Stanford, Notre Dame, Cornell, Princeton and many other elite institutions lost from 25 to 30 percent of their endowment funds, but rather than pound us with the details, the author elegantly lets one example stand for the whole. This gives the book an airy tone and has the effect of letting him glide over the subject matter rather than bludgeon a reader with reams of data.<br /><br />While taking note of their attributes, the author takes care not to romanticize traditional societies. He singles out infanticide, for example, as a custom of traditional societies that we are gratefully rid of.  At the same time, he gently admonishes those who would abolish the conventions of the modern nation state: &#34;Alas, for all of you readers who are anarchists, you'll have to find some tiny band or tribe willing to accept you.&#34;<br /><br />Even when the author explains differences in societies, a reader is likely to see similarities.  Segments of New Guinea society, for example, require the payment of &#34;sori money&#34; or sorry money in cases of accidental death, and truth be told, this is a practice in Western civilization as well, although the term is different.  We would call it &#34;insurance&#34;.  And while the barter system is no longer the basis for Western economies, it hasn't died out completely - on any given day, you can read a story in the papers about a dentist who fixed someone's teeth in exchange for having his car repaired.  For every rule, an exception.<br /><br />The World Until Yesterday is one of the few books I've read that describes eloquently and passionately the damage done to family relationships through Western family courts due to the toxicity of our family law system.  It describes convincingly how, in the author's case, after an episode in court, a friend of his will never speak to certain of her relatives again.  I can only underscore his comments, and note that because of the brutality and butchery of the family court system, I will never see or speak to my own sons again.<br /><br />Throughout the book the author weaves stories of traditional languages, religions and attitudes toward food, and his arguments are at their most powerful when he discusses hypertension, salt intake, diabetes, heart failure and other non-communicable diseases that appear rooted in Western style diets. Because of its disarming and conversational simplicity, this book unleashes powerful arguments that teach without propagandizing., this book unleashes powerful arguments that teach without propagandizing.

1594487154|5.0|In the past year I've read Tom Hopkins' classic on sales \\"How to Master the Art of Selling\\" and recently read Daniel Pink's new release, \\"To Sell is Human\\".  Hopkins' book gives you a lot of the how to sell from the sales process to different closes you can use to overcoming objections.  Pink takes a different look at sales.  \\"To Sell is Human\\" first points out that today we all need to be able to sell our product, service, or idea to be successful.  Also, with the amount of information available, the salesperson doesn't have the advantage of having more information than the buyer.<br /><br />To be successful in sales Pink points out how important attunement, buoyancy, and clarity is in the process to get others to accept or buy your goods, services, and ideas.  Then, Pink addresses how we can use pitch, improvisation, and service to gain influence with those we want.  There are two great things about Pink's writing that make his books standout.  First, Pink shares the research in the social science that shows why the concepts he addresses are effective.  Too many authors today share what worked for them, even though it may be other factors that helped make them successful.  Pink does the research to show how universal these themes are.  Second, \\"To Sell is Human\\" gives activities at the end of each chapter to help you develop the different areas.  With many books it is easy to enjoy the great ideas, but difficult to figure out how to implement them.  This book gives you the ideas, the research why it works, and the activities to help you develop yourself.<br /><br />Whatever profession you are in, you now need to be able to influence others.  If this makes you nervous, or if you aren't sure where to start, or if you want to continue to build your powers of persuasion, I would strongly recommend, \\"To Sell is Human\\".<br /><br />-I received an advance copy from the publisher, which I was thankful for since I had a chance to read it and provide my honest feedback.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my go to book for those times when you just need a break from the real world. I am constantly reading it, once I finish it I start it over again. Jane Austen novels are indeed timeless and must be enjoyed through all generations.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink's new book not only gives you proof this is the case (communication is selling) - it gives you the tools to master communication and selling.<br /><br />Daniel does an eloquent job of weaving the science of communication and selling with its practical application. In his chapter on clarity he speaks about Mihaly Cscikszentmilhayi's work on creativity to build the argument that success in the future will not rely on problem solving but problem finding. Daniel goes on to say how creativity is finding the problems others don't see.<br /><br />Woven throughout the book is the concept that good communication starts with self awareness and self acceptance. It's as if you want to communicate or sell well you needed to first be communicating well to yourself. Unlike many self help book Daniel gives you the whys a phenomenon is true and then simple steps to success using that concept.<br /><br />I started out as an entrepreneur 35 years ago because my standards kept getting me fired. I quickly realized that I had to learn to speak in an effective way to others to enroll them to buy my service. My passion alone wasn't enough. If I had this book back then my learning curve would have been much shorter. I would have understood what needed to be done and how to do it.<br /><br />Even though through trial and error I learned much, I found Daniel's book very helpful. I've recommended it to my friends and colleagues... I'm not recommending it to my competition.<br /><br />[As an act of full disclosure - I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone. ...they just wouldn't meet my price. Now that I read the book, I'm sure I could get it out of them.]
B008NEMPTO|5.0|Did not read the book but the movie was great.  Action, adventure, romance, humor and a bit of history for all those buffs.  Personally can not fathom why so many negative reviews, probably people mad that it didnt follow the book act for act.  Abe was always my favorite president followed up closely by JFK and now he is also my favorite monster hunter...sorry Van Helsing.  If you have any interest in this film or in the \\"real :-)\\" history of the civil war definitely give it a go!<br /><br />A great man once said, \\"Until we are all Free, no one is free.\\"<br /><br />Still so true.

B009JBZH54|5.0|First of all, I absolutely love all three movies.  Second of all, and by far the most important, was that all three are sold here for only roughly $30 whereas if you tried to buy The Dark Knight Rises by itself it costs around $26.  This package is a fantastic deal plus the little picture book that comes along with it is also very interesting and entertaining.  The case the movies are stored in is very solid not flimsy so you can be sure that the movies are protected.

B001AW156U|2.0|First off these triggers are not from Pelican which makes quality accessories, they are from some company called \\"Gioteck\\". Honestly they work great, but after about 3 months, and probably less than 20 hours of use, one of them popped off, I noticed that the plastic was basically crumbling as if it was made of wax. Both triggers now have visible cracks in them, and break if you touch them. Really a waste of money, unless you don't mind buying new ones every few months.<br /><br />I also contacted Gioteck, and haven't heard back from them yet.

B00AMBLDEE|1.0|I have loved all the previous movies. I was apprehensive about watching this movie in the first place. I should have listened to my gut feeling. This was horrible. It took almost an hour before the first fight scene. This movie is definitely a lead up to a following film in all honesty I say skip this movie. It just is not worth the money nor the time.

B00AB0AXU6|3.0|The graphics are great, but the story is starting to show it's age.  While all sequel tend to fall off from the original, in this age of fatuation with zombies, you would think they would have a little better storyline.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The other two were better (second is my favorite) and it gets a little convoluted... But the ending makes it all better!!!!
160774273X|2.0|This manual is for committed bakers in search of the perfect loaf of European, hearth-style artisanal breads, as \\"perfection\\" is defined by Ken Forkish.  The bread may very well be excellent.  And it would not surprise me to learn that it is indeed better than any other artisan bread achievable by home bakers.  The commitment required, however, extends not just to the time and care spent in creating the poolish, biga, levain and breads that are the subject of this book.  Forkish's vision of perfection also requires an investment of at least $100, if one doesn't already own (and who does?) a 4-quart cast iron Dutch oven (only available online, at least in this area), a behemoth of a 12-quart proofing container + lid, and 2 6-quart containers with lids.  And let's not forget that 1/16 teaspoon that also must be ordered.  If one doesn't already have two brotforms and a scale, throw in another $100.  And then try to figure out where to put those giant tubs in your tiny kitchen.  Forkish offers no workarounds or alternatives, other than to concede that you may use a 5-quart Dutch oven if that's what you have; but then he warns you that the loaf won't be as good. I don't have a 5-quart Dutch oven, so I'll be spared the temptation to make that compromise.<br /><br />I don't fault Forkish for insisting that this is the only way to make bread like the \\"Ken's Artisan Bakery\\" boules. Furthermore, I'm not opposed to making an investment of this sort.  But I'm not going to now.  Even if the bread were excellent - which I suspect it is - I don't care much for this book for two reasons.<br /><br />First, Ken Forkish launches the book, in a lengthy first chapter in Part 1, \\"The Principles of Artisan Bread,\\" with a long, self-absorbed, all-about-me narrative telling his personal story. Yes, it provides information as to where he's coming from. But frankly, I found it tedious.  Take a look at the great cookbooks revered as classics.  Not a single one focuses at such length and such detail on the author. A short resume on the back flap provides all the personal background I need, thank you.<br /><br />Second, this otherwise beautiful book includes numerous glaring typographical errors. What a shame that the author and editors do not respect their readers enough to spend a little money on decent copy editing, especially in light of the resources spent for the excellent photography and design work that make the book visually exquisite.  (And would someone please explain the hypocrisy here in devoting an entire section of self-righteous prose on the virtues of local sourcing of the flour used in Ken's Artisan Bakery and Ken's Artisan Pizza, while sending this book off to China for printing?)<br /><br />I wanted to love this book, but I don't. My wild yeast levain, created using simpler methods (described in William Alexander's \\"52 Loaves\\"), and the outstanding artisan bread it produces, without any special equipment, will continue to serve me well.  I may at some point decide that the additional investment of money and scarce space in my kitchen will be worth it for a marginally better loaf of bread. But I'm not there yet.  ;o)
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I found &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; engaging, for the most part, and a fun quick read. The narrative is first person, which works for the novel, I think, except that it betrays the lingering assumption that women think of little besides men. Putting that aside, I enjoyed the novel, enjoyed the language, and would recommend it as a vacation read.
1401233066|3.0|With a tight entertainment budget I may be cutting out the Fables for TPB's of The Walking Dead, Locke and Key, and Sweet Tooth.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have just started playing this game and like it a lot. It is the only Final Fantasy I had not played so I was happy that it made it to a platform I owned.  Playing with the tablet in ways is easier and harder than a controller.  Moving can sometimes be a pain but practice makes this less of a issue.  Selecting actions from the menu and enemies or parts of enemies is a breeze with the touch screen.<br />If you have not played the DS  version or just want a copy for your tablet I would highly recommend this for your RPG needs.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|loved it, Tim Burton style, made the Lincoln story darker and more fun to think about, I recommend this movie
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|The two leads are extremely gifted acting singers, and the support is excellent. Plasson and<br />his orchestra are wonderful, too. What sets this apart as a DVD is the theatricality of the<br />approach. This is not a \\"souvenir\\" of the performance, but the performance itself, with<br />occasional shots of the singers getting ready to enter or coming off the stage, of the<br />stagehands readying the next set, and of the front of the stage with the orchestra at work<br />with the singers. This roving camera is used sparingly, in order to keep the emphasis on the<br />stage, but it adds greatly to the experience. There is one very odd moment, though, at the end<br />of the first disc, when Charlotte is preparing for the start of the third act<br />(the \\"letters\\" scene). An assistant rushes up, as if to make some last-minute adjustment in<br />her toilette or whatever, and Sophie Koch rather brusquely shoves her away. Not now, I'm getting<br />into the moment, you interloper!
B00899F0G8|3.0|starts out good and dies out fast. As I continue the next season I wish they'd stop trying to make more of something and end it already it gets old fast!
B001VEE5KK|3.0|I guess I was just expecting more for an over 2 hour movie. Thought there could be more suspense in the court seens perhaps.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I usually enjoy Nicholas Sparks, but sometimes they read like a screen play,rather than a novel. This book was not like that, it was wonderful, and I couldn't put it down!!
B009CPES4I|5.0|Excellent acting from great cast ... several interesting story lines with some unexpected twists and turns.  Definitely worth the watch.
B0000024ZT|5.0|I still clearly recall the moment I sat down on the floor, headphones on, LP on the turntable and liner notes in hand for my introduction to life on E Street. I never looked back. Lyrical, energetic, heart wrenching, life affirming. A true storyteller emerged. And the rest, as they say, is history.
B000002513|5.0|The band and the songwriter evolve from adolescence to explore the world on their own terms. The songs are like old friends, the characters like neighbors. Musically inspiring by just the right touch of tuba, glockenspiel, accordion into the rock genre. It's a fun carnival ride.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a fabulous love story. Couldn't put the book down! Honestly, even though the sex is rampant in the trilogy, that is not what draws me in.  It is Christian and Ana's journey as a couple.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|It was a wonderful movie. I would recommend this! Streaming was clear and the quality was uninterrupted. Go for it!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is big and uses a lot of memory. It would be a 4 star app if it could be moved to the sd card. So until that happens I installed it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Such a captivating story! I have never finished a book series so fast! There's action, romance, suspense... everything you could ask for. And so creative on Suzanne Collins's part. I can't wait for all of the movies to finish production and see the full story come to life. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys a book that's hard to put down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is just about as good as his first ones.  Such a nice twist, his knowledge of how to 'work' the law is great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The lies start coming out. For those of you that just watched the first you still should read it so much just can't be found in the film.<br />.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of his best works to date. Can't wait till the next book comes out. If you haven't read the first five books.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this case. It feels great and stays snug with my Fire. Amazing!!! I recommend it to anyone and everyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great boom but didn't like the ending it was too abrupt and left you hanging too much. There should have Bern at least one more chapter
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|This book is very good because its interesting and fascinating. I'm so lucky that I have this book! Nice one Amazon
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Very well made the story was pretty Involved. I think the Batman series has definitely run its course though and it's time to move on
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is just too fun for words.  Also look for Little Inferno, made by the same people. If you're looking for something that challenges your mind without involving bullets and blood, this is a great game. Your job is to save as many balls of goo as you can. They stick together and create strings between them that you can use to build bridges, ladders, swings, etc. Just don't drop them into the occasional pits of acid...  Very humorous and lighthearted, entertaining and just plain fun.
B004T32SOK|2.0|I get drop box for free. I don't see the advantage of paying for something I can get for nothing.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|This is not as good as [[ASIN:B004WGIXX4 No Strings Attached]] but it is nonetheless fun and worth the price. The film has its well designed twists and turns and it is never completely predictable. One just wonders how many real \\"friends with benefits\\" are there in the world, but certainly this choice of partnership is becoming more acceptable and common in the early XXI century. There are even websites devoted to it. It sounds perfect does it not? Free fun without the burden of either commitment or involvement. Not so fast...
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Really cool toy. I loved it and it was fun to build and play with. It took me at least three and a half hours to build and I  will play with it for years.
030758836X|4.0|I just finished reading \\"Gone Girl\\" a few minutes ago. I read almost straight thru because it's that kind of book. I was kept wondering what was going to happen next because there was no telling what a warped mind would come up with, the warped mind belonging to Amy Dunne. The ending was a surprise, and not what I wanted to happen. The ending made me sick. I certainly had another ending in mind, but didn't get it. However, overall this was a good book. It really kept me guessing till the last couple of pages, but then I started thinking \\"oh-no, surely he won't.......\\", but he did.
1401923127|2.0|\\"The Biology of Belief\\" left me a little cold, although this may have had to do with my personal expectations after reading the Prologue.  Dr. Lipton tantalizes us early on by sharing a bit of his personal journey, going from fantasizing about being *anyone* else - to living a deeply satisfying and rewarding life.  Because I've been following the work of Dr. Herbert Benson (author of \\"The Relaxation Response\\") for the last year or so, I already buy into the idea that the mind has a profound effect on the physical body.  So while I found Dr. Lipton's biology lessons to be interesting, I expected the book to shift gears at some point and delve more into Dr. Lipton's personal transformation.  Instead, all we get is a few paragraphs about the discipline of PSYCH-K, founded by Rob Williams.  Perhaps the author wanted to show respect for his colleague by not \\"stealing his thunder\\".  But I finished this book feeling as if I'd purchased a 500-page thriller - only to get to the end and find that pages 400-499 had been ripped out.  Knowing that the story all works out in the end is great...but it's so much more satisfying to understand *how* the happy ending came about.
B005HSL626|5.0|The game works very well. Game is a lot of fun for everyone and easy to play. Great for kids and adults as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great.  Such a powerful story, and well written.  Can't wait for the next book.  I know it will just get better.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I downloaded this on my android phone for the kids, but I like it as much as they do.  On the phone it is fun, but with it bigger canvas (tablet computer) it woud be even better.  There is a choice of art media: paint, pencils, markers, crayons, stickers.  It is very intuitive, and you can save any art piece to an album.
0345803485|5.0|It helped me to keep my new years resaloution for 2012. I could'nt put it down. loved the stoy line.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Plenty of objects to put together for hours of fun.<br /><br />Many different ways to play with all the characters, dragons, and buildings.<br /><br />Really goes well with the other Ninjago products... which is most important I think.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Never saw the soap opera back in its day.  But I can see why it was a cult hit. Enjoyable but not sure if a sequel is needed
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addictive. its relaxing to play a game that does not take a lot of skill.  love this game
B009HV2JT8|4.0|a cool movie with awesome special effects. Vampires the way they ought to be! Not for those who cannot handle a little blood and gore.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|They did a great job with this series.  Sure I have issues with it, but I would watch the whole thing over again.  Love the unexpected twists and turns.  Hard to make a zombie series fresh, well done.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great book by Tom Clancy.  Can't wait for the next one.  Keep up the good work.  What's next for young Jack.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It all did come to the end,it was a final closure..It left me satisfied that I got the full story.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|My husband and I LOVE watching this movie, but we aren't always able to sit down together at 8 PM on Christmas Eve to watch it on network TV. So, when I saw it on Amazon, I knew it had to be in my husband's stocking this year! LOVE it!
B008Y6Y1RA|5.0|This movie was not exactly what I thought it would be. It was better!  It's got a wonderful story and a lot of comedy. This us one I could watch over and over!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|What can I say it's a Christmas CD.  I bought this CD for my mother last year as she always loved the crooners like Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.  She really likes this CD and when I visited this year she said she continues to listen to this CD alot.  Buble is no Sinatra but has his own style.  A good Christmas CD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My whole family enjoys playing this connection puzzle from the youngest to the oldest. Great mind exercise game! Will continue to play.
B000003CUJ|1.0|I guess I was hoping for a &#34;best of&#34; Wagner.  I wasn't familiar with many of the selections, but worse, the pieces started somewhere in the middle and then just stopped somewhere else in the middle.  I listened to it once but won't waste the time again.
B006PTZNSY|2.0|Every song (excluding one) started out with profanity and continued in that same theme. This cd needs more than just a 'parental advisory' stamp; it was intolerable for my household.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is just like temple run only it is more realistic because you are a kid who grafittied a train car and you have to run from the police so it is much more realistic than monkeys chasing you. this game is so cool. plus its free
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Decently written novel that definitely captures your attention. Fairly sure I will read the others as well at some point.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are fun, some are a little hard and some are easy. game does not freeze, loads fast. try this game out
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is probably the best game i've played on a mobile device. It is really great and challenging. Some of the maps are to hard though. Round 70 is easy to pass if you have a dartling gunner and a few super monkeys. This is better than the computer version but needs sandbox mode like the computer version.
B000FC1JCQ|3.0|Perhaps this was cutting edge and needed when the women's mvmt was young, but it just went on and on until I was sick to death of the story and hated the main characters.  Very disappointing and a waste of a lot of time.  That's probably a bit too harsh.  There are memorable characters and scenes; it has changed my view--forever-- of these well-known heroes.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie also.I think the actors selected to play the parts were perfect in all the series and just seem to click and I can't wait to see Fast Six.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|i totally recomend this awesome book, it was really great. i loved it i also learnt a lot fromit. i definatly will try not to stare or be mean to kids like that.it can really hurt someones fealings. you also have to be careful with what you say becuase it can really hurt someones fealings.
B00008MZ0O|4.0|Good movie even for a woman to watch. I have enjoyed the series of Fast & furious.I'm glad I bought it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|this is a really awesome game. It is lots of fun.  it is kind of addicting. The graphics are super.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I tried to download this because none of the MP3's I've bought from Amazon will play on any of the players I have on my android tablet but I can't get this thing installed either - waste of time and/or money to buy the player and the music
B0063M22QO|5.0|I can spend hours playing Mahjong. I have done so tonight playing this version and the Butterfly Mahjong. Both are really great to play and I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a fun game.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|Okay, so this rules. I fell in love with the Shakes this past summer. Saw them live a couple times and this band is pure talent. I mean, seriously - incredible. I've heard the lead singer, Brittney Howard, compared to Janis Joplin more than once. I wish this band the very best, because they deserve it. The COOL thing about this vinyl is that it also comes with a 45 (didn't realize that at first) with 3 more songs that I didn't originally have on just the CD. So buy it. You'll be doing yourself a favor.
B000Q76K24|4.0|Great ensemble cast, script, and story line.  Not an over-the-top (faux-)adventure as is so common n the genre.<br /><br />Good stuff.
1451696191|5.0|I've loved this book for years. Probably the 4th copy I own. Too much? Don't care - It's SO GREAT!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I was in awe of what these men went through in these two campaigns.  It was truly unbelievable.  If you think war is &#34;glorious&#34; or if you think men and women in the service want to go to war.........read this book.
0446547573|5.0|beautiful story. I love romantic stories, and this book met my expectations. I love all Nicholas Sparks's books. The best!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Can't wait to start the next one to find out what happened with Katniss and Peers and Gale!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great every time. Easy to download books and easy to use the app. Couldn't be more self-explanatory. Very pleased.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read and enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books, and this one was really good! It tells of a family, starting in modern times, and going back to tell the story the mother of the family,  a young woman in England during W.W. II. It captured my interest from the start, and I did not guess the surprise at the end. I look forward to reading more books by this author in the future
0062213423|5.0|i bought it for my sister, shes 11. I had it sent to her home. She opened it and loved it she, was so happy. She tells me  constantly how great it is along with facts. Great buy for that one direction fan in your life.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|you only get two levels before it asks you to fork over more money. come on two! if they want five dollars for it flat out ask.
B0086700CM|5.0|I totally love this app! its amazing. very fun and entertaining. if you are looking for a good game app to play, then temple run is first!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.  The actors were brilliant.  I have always wanted a robot like Robbie.  Why can't I build one of those!<br /><br />Anyway, if you want a fun time with family, something everyone can enjoy then this is the movie for you.  It has enough action, adventure and plus that old time charm that keeps me watching it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Once I start playing I can't stop.  &#34;Just one more game&#34;, I say to myself,. but find myself ignoring my promise.
B00005JPTK|5.0|I have never read the book, so I cannot compare this to that. This is a story about a zombie outbreak and will smiths character is the doctor and presumably the only person trying to find a cure for it. He goes around New York City hunting and gathering supplies during the day and hiding in his house at night. It is a very interesting story line and as I said very action packed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Because I have limited eyesight I prefer facebook on my Mac over my Iphone or Kindle fire.  Facebook keeps changing things I like about it and it frustrates me.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game that focuses on building up your part of a civilization faster than anyone else. You roll the dice to collect supplies  and then you can use those supplies to build developments and cities as well as roads. You are allowed to trade with other players to get the supples you need as well as trade in a certain number of one resource for another. You can have the largest army or the longest road as these will definitely help you get to the end faster. This is a very fun game that makes you figure out a strategy to win the game.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use my You Version of the Bible every day.  I like comparing all the different versions and the convenience of having a bible with me all the time.  I find it a little slow in a church service when I want to follow the preacher with scriptures.  He is usually done by the time I get to the next scripture.  However.  It is great and I thank you so much for it.
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|My granddaughter loved it. She took them everywhere at xmas day. They will be great companion very soon, when autumn comes.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved this book. It definitely kept you on the edge of your seat wanting to know more. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes suspense and excitement. Granted there are some rather boring parts, but there's at least one boring part in every book there is.  I really enjoyed this book & am looking forward to the next!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|fantastic game. mu h needed. ive played a few similar for tablets and this one blows them out of the water. never played loo but was a big fan of dota
0812993292|5.0|This was for my son for Christmas and he loved it.  I was happy with how quickly it arrived, especially considering it was the holidays.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|My girlfriend and I enjoy this movie again and again :) its a classic and amazon instant video made it easy to watch
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is a great stylus and I have been constantly using it for 4 months with no problems. I use it for writing, drawing, and playing certain games. I tried cheaper styli that come in the 3-packs, but those ripped too easily and didn't last longer than a few weeks. It was about time I invest more into a better product. I think Studio Neat's concept of creating a stylus similar to a dry erase marker was ingenious because indeed writing on an iPad is not like writing on paper. I personally like the weight of the stylus, but others may find it heavy. You do have to apply some pressure for the iPad to register, but it still glides nicely on the screen. Since the stylus is pretty big(size comparable to dry erase marker), it is hard to write small and also the grip has a nice feeling to it, but easily attracts dust.<br /><br />I did consider other styli such as Adonit Jot(seems like replaceable disk at the tip can easily be lost), Applydea Maglus(oddly shaped), and Wacom Bamboo(the tip was soft like previous stylus I owned). However, I think the Cosmonaut better fits my needs. I tend to be pretty abusive with my belongings and it is holding up really well. Overall great product!<br /><br />Summary:<br />Pros<br />- durable<br />- nice weight(depends on user)<br />- comfortable grip<br />- glides on screen with little pressure<br /><br />Cons<br />- grip attracts dust<br />- it's pretty pricey<br />- size; it's pretty big making it hard to write small
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I couldn't put this book down and was quite surprised with the ending.  I rated the book a four only because I wanted all the answers.  Lindyengteacher
B0026772N8|4.0|I read this novel when it first came out in the early seventies (man, that seems a long time ago!) and was very intrigued by it. When I saw the Kindle ebook, I bought it on a whim and gave it a second read. Pretty incredible how different my impression was this time around. I understood more about the philosophers that Mr. Pirsig writes about, and the story line came to me more through the father's eyes than the son's. It was very enjoyable to read the sixites' slang terms like &#34;square&#34; and &#34;groovy&#34; and relate back to those crazy years. I have the sequel, Lila, in hardcover, and now that I've gotten this refresher, I will begin that book.<br />PS the new foreword by Mr. Pirsig is very helpful in getting back into the story. I thank him for that.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved this version. It is so heartfelt. I listen to it all the time. And the price here on amazon is great.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Not the best game...not so user friendly...not worth the 'free' download.  Please make more clear before offering this application please.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Does what it should - plays solitaire. If you are looking for something special this isn't it. It is just what it is called - solitaire.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I'm not sure what others are looking for. But considering I payed $2 for these including shipping, if I can get a couple months out of each battery it would be worth it.  Have only used 2 of the 5 so far and they are going strong so far.  I will update if they die soon.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My wife (40ish) and the girls (13 and 14) loved it!  Seemed like a great early teen type of movie.
B005KELQEU|5.0|a like the fact that it zips up so no chance of the kindle slipping out, fits in my purse
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I fell in love with the characters and their story. I could not put the book down. Way to go Nicholas Sparks.
B001NT057K|5.0|This is definitely an album for fans. If you love the movie &#34;Grease&#34;, you will love the soundtrack. It has all the songs, even the ones from the dance off. If you are unfamiliar with the movie or the songs, then definitely watch the movie first. This is mostly a nostalgia album.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|One of the best apps so far from the store. This charging app shows you everything you need or want to know about the battery. A great tool for sure.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|all good, wow they still have it, they are still the best by far.....wish they would tour again...saw them in 1977 in the garden!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Came as ordered and my brother in law loved it.  Was  on his wish list so, I did not see.
B00992CF6W|3.0|All-in-all a decent version of vanilla minecraft. Fun when nothing much else is going on or you have run out of paint to watch dry. Don't get me wrong, I love PC Minecraft but the controls on this really make it too tedious to really get into.<br /><br />For kindle fire, you may want to pass on this.<br /><br />Grab the PC version with Tekkit or Feed the Beast for some great Minecraft fun.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This is a very interesting and complete collection of one the the finest mystery writers of all time.  I love it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Beautiful artwork great storyline and challenging game play.  I am a big HO fan and this a great one. Please more like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited a long time to even begin reading this book thinking it would not be for an older man who is use to reading the Grisham's and Higgin's.  With a gift card from a young adult who i trust i thought i would give it a try and was totally capitivated by it.  I instantly downloaded the next book in the series and am enjoying it.  Good books for all ages and a great way to get our younger generation reading.  Exciting and action packed with some good moral situations.

0785163174|5.0|Outstanding story line.  The artwork was awesome and excellent at the same time .  Brain Michael Bendis is outstanding.  I love having the entire story in one large hardcover book.  I recommend this book to every fan of Marvel Comics.  Excellent...Excellent...Excellent...
B004SDEP38|1.0|The user interface on this app is horrible. In the Word app, somehow they created their own text entry method which isn't recognized by higher end keyboards like Swiftkey. If your keyboard does anything more than insert one character at the cursor then it won't work with this app.<br />Excel isn't any better. You have to select the cell, then select the formula bar and then change your keyboard to numbers. Otherwise you select a cell, switch to numbers and start typing a number, then it selects the formula bar for you and switches back to letters. It's useless for doing anything more than simple math with 3 cells that any calculator app could do.<br />It's decent at viewing documents imported from your computer, but no more so than any other office app. So just go get any other office app.<br />Also, it looks like it hasn't been updated in at least 4 months, which is half way to eternity in software development time.<br /><br />Let this faded gem of an app continue to fade into obscurity.
1401235417|5.0|The artwork was not as good as other DC comics but the story line was excellent.  I cannot remember seeing Batman actually scared and rattled as in this story.  Seeing him question his belief in Gotham City was astonishing.  Excellent background information on Richard Grayson's origin.  Cannot wait for Vol 2.  Recommended reading for every fan of Batman....and the original Robin....and Nightwing
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie first and really enjoyed it, so I knew I needed to read the book.  It didn't disappoint!  Looking forward to the rest in the series.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham needs to renew his repertoire. The plot is good the action fast paced. Typical Grisham. A lawyer is caught in a government issued conspiracy. With the help of a beautiful woman and others our hero outplays the bureaucrats only doing their jobs, and end up with a boatload of money. Very cleverly so.<br />A good book for those not so familiar with Grisham's books. For the others it is entertaining but nothing new.

Yes, it's a &#34;chick-flick&#34; but it captured my heart. The movies are great on Amazon because they're stored and always available. I have a Roku and can access them on any TV in my house as with the new video player for my iPad, Amazon movies have gone to the next level with access.

B004XNGKBS|2.0|I was using it all the time on my asus transformer tablet. It even worked better than the super note that came with it, since docking it with the keyboard did not crash it. However, after about a week it force closes. I have no idea what happened nor the cause of it. I thought I finally found a program to replace paper for work. Now though I am stuck wastng paper and time again. I got this as faoft a long time ago. I did not expect to use it but now that I have a tablet I kind of need to. I wish it would work again. I rebooted,double checked to make sure I was logged into amazon app store and everything else I could think of. Please fix it

B0038P2AZW|5.0|The overall concept, especially with the ending, was unique. I liked it so much that now I'm on a trip trying to find movies similar to it. I don't remember this ever in the theaters. Would love if it were instead coming out now in 3D and 48FPS. The creatures were unique and there was an overall--what the hell is going on?--feeling that kept me engaged. I'm now off to pursue Sunshine, Eden Log, Pitch Black, Solaris, The Descent, hoping to find a similar vibe.
B00756GKBA|3.0|This CD is o.k. - although I love Madonna and most of the songs on my other CDS; this CD only had one or two tracks I really enjoyed.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|its ok but there is one problem. so today I got the game on my kindle fire and scored a lot of points. when I closed the app and went back to play.......it lost all my scores and the points. when you get this game beaware of when you could loose the score or points when you close the app.(only if you wanted to keep your score)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't read the book  before the first movie came out so the whole story came as a shock to me. Then this book just had me on my toes just as the first movie did. I give it five stars for a great story line for a sequel and for giving the characters more life and extending their role in this futuristic fascinating place of states and regions. I can't wait to see how the third book begins and ends. I recommend this book for anyone of all ages. They have just have to have an imagination for everything that isn't like how it is today.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|To not waste everyone's time this review is going to be short.  My reason for the bad review is sound quality only, as described in detail by others.  In the 80's and early 90's I had Metallica on cassette tapes and the sound from a walkman using those tapes and a low quality headset was way better than this CD.  Terrible.  The bass guitar and drum just come through as a bunch of resonating noise.<br />However, the musical quality is outstanding. I still listen to this CD despite the horrible sound quality, that is how much Metallica really re-established itself as a leading metal band with this album.  I don't know if the mp3's that you can purchase from Amazon sound any better, I heard that the guitar hero version of this album has way better sound, so go for that instead, do not buy the CD version.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Saw this movie preview and thought, \\"I've got to read it!\\" When I got my new Kindle on Christmas I knew what my first book would be! Great book, read in one sitting. A book that everyone can connect with.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Intriguing. Suspenseful. Suzanne Collins writing style is accurate and easy to believe. Can't wait to read the next book Catching Fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it's pull to read more. The characters have so much depth to them it's insane. There was a spot in the book I know other authors would have ended the book leaving the reader to wanting more but she continued to a whole new twist. Wow!!

B001NLL93W|4.0|Again I must say my sister was right. I hate to say that. But I couldn't put the book down and I am off to read the next one.
1476712042|5.0|Found this one to be just heart wrenching and tear jerking in several parts. Just enough sexual tension to keep it interesting but not over the top (like 50 shades/Bared to You). Great young adult story line with believable characters that were well developed and thought out, if not completely frustrating and lovable. Great read.
B001NLKT60|4.0|It was a good book. It took a while for it to get interesting but it was overall a thriller.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great trilogy and always something New every time I revisit. The ending is right on and a great relief from a couple who literally has done it all.

B006LSZECO|5.0|What a well written exciting book to read.  Surprise ending.  It has characters that you will love and hate.  I truly enjoyed reding it.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|As fine an actor as he is and despite his acumen in vocal mimicry, Anthony Hopkins somehow misses the mark in impersonating the legendary director in this 2012 biopic. Perhaps it's his overly deliberate line readings or the artificiality of the latex prosthetics or the vivid memory I have of the real filmmaker, but some combination of those factors prevented me from fully accepting Hopkins as Hitchcock. That's a shame since Helen Mirren, who plays Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, which if this story is to be believed, was the master filmmaker's muse and confidant, is quite effective in conveying the stringent manner of her influential character while revealing Alma's aching vulnerability in having to live in her husband's considerable shadow. Loosely based on Stephen Rebello's meticulously researched 1990 book [[ASIN:1593765118 Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]], the screenplay has been adapted by John J. Laughlin ([[ASIN:B004U8VWLE Black Swan]]) to focus more on the relationship between Hitchcock and Alma rather than the production of [[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho]] itself.<br /><br />Director Sacha Gervasi takes the same granular approach that Simon Curtis did with [[ASIN:B0076NKLRQ My Week With Marilyn]] and Steven Spielberg did with \\"Lincoln\\", i.e., focus on a specific time period in the subject's life and let those events speak to what motivated the character throughout his or her life. However, unlike those films, Gervasi doesn't adequately reveal what made the rule-breaking filmmaker a genius in his field. The challenging production of \\"Psycho\\" is handled superficially, even the shower scene is given a cursory glance with lackadaisical intercutting of other characters showing how anger manifested itself in Hitchcock. There are also imaginary interludes that show him receiving advice from convicted serial killer Ed Gein, the real-life inspiration for Norman Bates, on how to stage the more gruesome scenes. What does receive a lot of attention is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma and how instrumental her sharp editing skills were in distilling the more memorable moments of the film.<br /><br />Her sense of self-worth is shaken enough by Hitchcock's self-absorption that she is easily seduced by the unbridled attention of smarmy screenwriter Whitfield Cook who wants to collaborate with her on his next big-screen project. Meanwhile, casting Janet Leigh in the film unexpectedly brings out the director's tender side as castmate Vera Miles reflects a barely concealed bitterness for having been a Grace Kelly-like Hitchcock prot&eacute;g&eacute; now reduced to a supporting role to complete her contract. Neither Gervasi nor Laughlin can seem to make all these intertwining storylines resonate beyond a reasonable evocation of the period. Beyond Hopkins and Mirren, there are good albeit underdeveloped performances from Scarlett Johansson as Leigh and Jessica Biel as Miles, neither of whom bears much resemblance to their real-life counterparts. James D'Arcy, however, manages to capture Anthony Perkins' callow nervousness in just a few brief minutes of screen time. All in all, it's an interesting piece of film trivia that falls short of its goal of being something more.elationship with Alma and how instrumental her sharp editing skills were in distilling the more memorable moments of the film.<br /><br />Her sense of self-worth is shaken enough by Hitchcock's self-absorption that she is easily seduced by the unbridled attention of smarmy screenwriter Whitfield Cook who wants to collaborate with her on his next big-screen project.

B008NEVP1S|3.0|I love Aimee Mann's music (especially her vocals) and have many of her CDs.  I was really looking forward to hearing this one, seeing all the positive reviews, but after a couple of listens am disappointed.  I agree with the other reviewer who called this \\"Snoozer\\".  The songs seem really flat -- like too many Paxils or something.  I would be more critical if I could write a decent song myself, but seriously, go buy some other Aimee Mann CD instead -- one with tunes that you'll sing along to, or at least have a hummable hook that you'll remember five minutes later.  Aimee -- I think you're hugely talented -- what happened on this one?
B00746TURW|2.0|Not much point to the story. Very disappointing finish. Self absorbed narrator that waffled on and on. Missed the point.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was an exciting book with very funny moments.  I can't wait to read the next book.  Very thrilling and it pulls you in.  Go Rick Riordan!  I think that when he does the point of views, it captures the emotions and feelings of the character.  I love to highlight all the funny moments the characters tell, so I can go back and read them.<br />  Anabeth  was obviously the star, with her dramatic scenes and moments.  Leo was a main character too, with his quick wit and fingers.<br />  Percy was OK,but needed more into him.  Hazel and her background story was very deep with many emotions.  Frank was just plain cool.<br />  Piper was just an add on to the story,but with Jason she sparkled.  Jason was like Frank.  Cool.<br />  All of there relations we're sweet.<br />  GREAT BOOK!

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|The main complaint I heard and read before JACK REACHER ever even hit theatres was from fans of Lee Child's series of books about this film's titular character, and it was always the same complaint: \\"Tom Cruise is too short! Jack Reacher is 6'5\\" and is built like a brick outhouse!!\\" And my response to that was always: \\"Can you think of an actor who's really good, does action well, has a lot of charisma, and IS ACTUALLY built like that?\\"<br /><br />Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-Winning screenwriter of Bryan Singer's unforgettable THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and the writer/director of the very forgettable THE WAY OF THE GUN, picked up his pen and got back behind the camera for this potential franchise first outing for the cinematic adventures of Jack Reacher (Cruise), former Army military police investigator. He's, as they say in the film, a ghost. He has no fixed address, no credit cards, no phone number. In fact, the only proof of his existence is a bank account, his military record, and his military pension. He buys his clothes from Goodwill as needed and donates the old ones, hops on a bus, and goes wherever the day takes him. But in a very disturbing and wordless opening sequence, a man with a military-grade sniper rifle shoots five people in front of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. All the clues lead back to Army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora, who spends most of the film in a coma) as a man who just snapped. The lead District Attorney (the great Richard Jenkins) is pushing for the death penalty, but the defense attorney for Barr, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) is looking to stop that from happening. It also happens that Helen is the daughter of the DA. When told to confess, with all the convenient evidence stacked against him, Barr only has one thing to tell them: \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". Once Reacher comes on the scene, he is fully aware of what's been going on, but uncertain as to why Barr asked for him, because he fully believes that Barr is guilty. Nevertheless, Reacher ends up working as an investigator for Helen, and runs afoul of the real reason those people were killed, and uses all his skills and investigative talents to find the truth.<br /><br />It's true that this film is a little thin on character development. We know just enough about each character to keep the momentum going forward, but no more than that. Character motivation gets even less time. For all intents and purposes, this film feels more like a throwback to 80's detective thrillers, but with a smarter and more modern sensibility. McQuarrie seems much more assured behind the camera here than I've seen before, and he creates a labrinythian mystery here that feels organic as Reacher follows up on each clue, and Cruise seems to be having a good time playing a character that is somewhat out of step with the outside world, but always seems to be able to see the angles played against him. It's also true that some quality actors seem a little wasted here, with the only real exceptions being Pike, a menacing Jai Courtney (SPARTACUS) as the villain's right-hand man and a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a retired Marine and shooting range owner who ends up coming along for the ride. Actors like Michael Raymond James (TERRIERS, TRUE BLOOD), Jenkins, and David Oyelowo (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) are kind of shafted. Even famed director Werner Herzog, the real villain of the piece, is more of a cartoonishly creepy villain. Also true, apparently, to huge fans of this series, that the film in no real way resembles the book this film is based on, which is the ninth book in the series called ONE SHOT.<br /><br />Why then do I give this film a 4 out of 5?<br /><br />Because this was an incredibly fun film. I like protagonists that are on the outside looking in, and always seem to have that extra step ahead. Jack Reacher is very much kin to 24's Jack Bauer; they are both renegades, they're both very smart, they're both men of serious action, they follow justice and not the law, and if people would only listen to them, things would be over a lot quicker. Although, Reacher has a much more evident sense of humor than Jack Bauer ever did. He has some terrific zingers along the way here, particularly in a 5-on-1 fight scene. He also carries himself with an assuredness that is rare to see in a modern action hero. Most films at present have the heroes of the film constantly questioning themselves. Are they up to the task? Can they be the hero the people involved need? Can they win the day without compromising their values? JACK REACHER as a film and as a character throw those discussions to the wayside in favor of a more entertaining romp as opposed to a more navel-gazing reluctant hero that seem to dominate films of late. The pace of the film also seems nicely breezy as well, which has a bit of a mismatch of tone that the opening of the film would have us believe. While it's a long-ish film, it doesn't seem long at all.<br /><br />I understand people's frustration with this film, but I don't subscribe to it because when it comes right down to it, I enjoyed the hell out of JACK REACHER, but if the box office indications are worth anything, it's unlikely I'll see more of his adventures on the big screen.he law, and if people would only listen to them, things would be over a lot quicker.

1476715904|5.0|A new author and one of my favs! Her three books are at the top of my best books list for 2012. Cant wait for the last \\"slammed\\" book to come out!!! And maybe a sequel for Hope and Holder????
1451638450|5.0|This book is a delight.<br /><br />I've been tracking Ivan through the Vorkosigan Saga, from the early \\"Ivan You Idiot\\" references. Yet he never actually did anything idiotic, after he was a kid. In a family of driven geniuses, a merely clever unambitious fellow doesn't shine.<br /><br />But there is a moment in Civil Campaign which promised that Ivan's story would be told, and Bujold has made good.<br /><br />One problem that is showing up in series, is the author finds herself compelled to put her character through worse and worse situations, to the point where the reader, as the empath, is subjected to torture, assault, and misery from one end to the other. (An example is the excellent Nevada Barr series, where Anna Pidgeon at this point has been driven to the point of a nervous breakdown, and had to leave her employment as National Park Ranger which was the fuel of the stories).<br /><br />Bujold has the ability to leaven the pain and passion of her stories with joy, which is what makes them so readable.<br /><br />Ivan is catapulted into an adventure of deception, romance, intrigue, treasure-hunting, and detective work that is hard to put down. Seeing the Vorkosigan menage from Ivan's point of view is a sideways take on the world that offers an intriguing and enjoyable new perspective.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is a great app. It took me some time to tinker around and experiment with learning how to manipulate this program, but once I got the hang of it, it proved to be very useful. Friends and family frequently contact us (mostly my techy husband) for help solving their computer issues and this has been the hot ticket to resolving their problems from a distance. For example, my parents live about an hour away but by using this program, we are able to log on to their computer from wherever we may be and help them with whatever they're trying to do. It's also great if I need to retrieve a document from my home computer. Downloading the program is fast and easy and it's free for personal use as well. Can't beat that! I definitely recommend this program.
B00338QENI|5.0|I have been interested in HeLa cells since studying biology many years ago.  It was so very interesting to read the real story of the true &#34;donor&#34; of the cells that are still growing all over the world.  Sad that the Henrietta's family was treated with such disregard for so long.  Excellent book!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun and very addictive. Some complaints were made about buying coins but u don't have to as they do replenish when u get so low. Luv it and now I don't have to wait on the yearly carnival to play!
B00004R99L|5.0|Before going to see Disney on Ice I wanted to familiarize my  4 year old daughter with some of the classics.<br />It was in good condition and she loves it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted is one of those movies that you actually like it better the 2nd you watch it. It was worth renting though and the movie had lots of funny lines.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved the graphics and story. If only the game was a little longer. Playthrough was only a few short hours. Eep. At least there is a sequel.... right?
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and think it's worth 5 stars! The game was fun and I played it all day. The lava part was definitely my favorite.
1589949811|5.0|Love games, love LOTR.  So far of all the game versions of LOTR, this is my favorite.  Very easy to learn to play if you are familiar with other CCGs like MTG, without the giant sucking sound on your wallet.  The LCG is infinitely more affordable.  I play this with my sons and they get it.  The cooperative game type, makes this a real winner.  We are all playing together.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|useless..not worth it even for free. not a good search engine...just go to Google regularly used better. I DELETED IT AFTER 3rd search.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This has  now become one of my favorite books ever. It was what you hope every time you pick up a book: exciting, well written, imaginative, interesting, and educational. Loved it!
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|they songs are sweet good tracks drake he is a really good singer but thanks for having this cd thanks
B005LAIISA|5.0|We watched it twice on Christmas.  A great addition to the series.  Enjoyable for all ages. Nice to see the faces of the voices at the end.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This application does what it says it does, is simple and easy to use. It also gives you the option to display different colors on the screen. The most useful part is the flashlight.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Finished on Windows 7 long time ago, and i have it now on my Android smartphone! This game is a masterpiece! Great soundtrack and simple but effective graphics!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is a great truth of back when the Great Depression came about. Peoples way of life had to change drastically & wow did it!!!! What a great movie in every aspect! If you are looking for a good story about Action, Suspense and Drama with a Love Story, You have found the right movie.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Great movie for anyone, but history buffs will like this a lot.  The fact that Henry VIII first took up with Mary Boleyn and even may have fathered a child (or two) with her (though he never formally ackowledged any children by Mary.  This is a part of this historical drama that rarely is told.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I love  this book so much it's s big twist on a Cinderella story but that's what makes this book so good .I can't wait for book two to come out 2015 seems like a long time to wait for the last book to come out but I'm willing to wait!!!:)
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I was a little short, but I love this movie.  Touching mother-daughter relationship. Disney always produce excellent movie, can't wait to see others in the future.
0553593544|5.0|The book was in excellent shape for a &#34;used&#34; book.  I enjoyed the book immensely because it is so very different from the recent Matt Damon movie.  It was closer to the Richard Chamberlain movie from decades ago.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The true heart of a country is shown in the individuals it sends forward into the world. As time passes we will find out about many more of our hero's.  This book is written to show us the life of one of our countries best.  Heartwarming thru heartbreaking.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|In the tradition of Disney, beautiful animation and sweet story.  My husband was the one who really wanted to watch this because it was Disney animation
B004WW88BK|5.0|I have always been a fan of the old school Delta Blues with Robert Johnson being on the top of my list. Also, I mainly listen to the classic legends of pure rock such as Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughn, etc. In listening to these bands or individuals, it's amazing to hear the influence of Johnson, Buddy Guy, Son House and so many more. To hear some of the greatest guitarists of today (Clapton, Page, Beck, etc) say that if it were not for the older blues musicians they would be nowhere today, just says it all. I love this album and have listened to it over and over. If you have an appreciation for the old school classic blues, this is a great piece work to add to your collection. I love the original sound of the recordings with the hiss, crackle and nothing but an old acoustic guitar, which to me give the sounds much more depth and feel. Enjoy!
B009CPES4I|5.0|I knew this would be worth watching by just looking at the cast. Awesome acting!! Very nice story. Would definitely recommend this non-action film with great story and character development
B005LAII12|5.0|There are few movies we care to own, but this was a must have, especially if you're from New England.
B0063GORYU|5.0|need strategy to win.  not your mindless game of solitaire.  both fun and challenging.  never gets boring.  one of my favorite apps.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Was surprised my wife liked this movie. Other than the crude humor, all the characters and and story line are quite \\"sweet\\"
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is a really good free game!  Once you get pass level 13, it gets a bit more difficult, but its addictive.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|its a very simple and fun game to play. a very good way to pass your time. very addicting and hard to stop playing. safe for all ages and very cute to boot!!!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Yes, another Bourne movie.<br />Tied Legacy to other Bourne movies.<br />Had action and a story.<br />Not as intense as other Bourne movies
B000FIMHJ4|4.0|grew up with this group. liked certain songs of there.  part of my teenage years.  recommend if you like hardcore music
B000069HJI|1.0|davies & hodgson went solo in1983 & this cd should never have been created raining again is boring dont leave me has no real fade rest of the cd s just pure litter
B004SUWR2C|4.0|my kids and me love playing this game. we enjoy it as whole family. i also like playing it by myself.
B000068FXX|4.0|honestly who could have thought supertramp career would turn short5year later this opus is close to perfection especially babaji& the whole last side
B000002OMN|4.0|grew up with this cd.  only liked certain songs of his. part of my teenage life that got me through school
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Good continuation of the series. Not an Oscar contender and not art film but a few good laughs, good characters and a little wit. Good way to spend a lazy evening,
B000001FKY|5.0|one of my favorite groups. another one that got me through school. and my teenage years. recommend it to 80s fans
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I am so amazed with this App. I love music but don't have the ability to remember all the names of bands or songs so if a song comes on I just tap the Shazam App and it brings it up as fast as it can. I get so excited when I get a song and I get introduced to a new band. It really is an amazing thing technology.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|We had already seen the movie before we decided to purchase.  All of my 6 kids love the movie, so it makes a great addition to our movie collection. Delivery was just in time for Christmas.
B0030DL3FU|4.0|Does everything you need, I never fully loaded my processor or used the turbo boost, but it's not for the hardcore gamer, just for your average gaming, and average work. It does a great job for what it is.
1419705849|5.0|My son has been following and reading the entire series from the very beginning.  He has not been disappointed yet.  It came in time for Christmas and the price was outstanding.
0385535147|3.0|Am only about two thirds through the book, but it's OK. Hopping it will get more edge of the seat with time
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|It does not work at alll for me.  Tried plugging it into different outlets with no result.  The little charge light<br />on my Kindle remains unlit.  IJt is of zero use to me.  Sorry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very fun good book for teens and older. Different then the movie by far way more details for sure go read it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is just the kind of game that I love.  Clear the red blocks while keeping the green ones.  It sounds so simple but can take some thinking and trial and error.  The cute little faces on the blocks add a little whimsy and make it fun for people of all ages.<br /><br />I only wish there was a hint screen. I am currently stuck on Level 62. I am sure it is a timing thing but would like to know if I am on the right track.
B008KW43TE|5.0|With this album, Frank Ocean has really brought into question what R&B and pop music is. The sound and his vocals show a clear homage to the previous crooners while definitively being its own entity. Go support this lp!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The feed doesn't show past 10 or so posts...worthless!  Use the browser on your phone or tablet instead to avoid frustration.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Seen most of Grisham's movies but this is my first book. I read it in four days, couldn't put it down.  The story kept me guessing until the end when the truth was unveiled. Easy to read, lots of detail and clever story.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|Whenever I click on the mushroom icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, the game says &quot;processing&quot;, and opens a bunch of Windows until the entire screen goes blank. I am then forced to close and reopen the game.<br /><br />Also, when I go into the game and check my achievements, the game says &quot;this game does not support achievements&quot;, even though it does.<br /><br />These glitches excited on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />When these bugs are fixed, I will give this game the five stars it deserves.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Can I give it 6 stars? Seriously, these Icelandic folks make some awesome music and the lyrics are fun and catchy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded solitaire to my kindle fire. Easy to play by just hitting the card you want to play. But dislike having to sidestep those singles ads.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|Love the soundtrack.  Rated it four out of 5 since some of the songs I love from the show didn't make the soundtrack.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I first started read \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I wondered why it was so highly recommended. I'm so glad my first impression was wrong. This story was thought provoking and one of the best I've read.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|The classical collection of &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; is one that takes you through sad and happy music, dark and light, instrumental and opera.<br /><br />After listening to it a few times, I took the books and started putting together a musical track with a scene in the book. That was fun, and it completes the atmosphere of the scenes.<br /><br />If you LOVE LOVE LOVE the trilogy, like I did, you will love this CD.
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|D2's first full-release in nine years released in 2009 turned out to be crisp pop rock with some radio-friendly tracks. Danger Danger(often nicknamed as D2) is a veteran rock band debuted in 1989. Their debut album with minor hit Bang Bang and their second album \\"Screw it!\\" with some tracks with extensive radio airplay are excellent rock albums earning classic rock masterpiece status. Their music bent is more like Bon Jovi, Loverboy or Foreigner than Poison or Gun's and Roses or their comtemporaries. They are often compared to Enuff'Z Nuff in a way the band's penchant to pursue hit-oriented rock tracks. Although they keep releasing great albums since then such as Four The Hard Way in 1997 and Return of the Great Gildersleeves in 2000, they are tragically ignored by American corporate music world. Their latest release in 2009 in my opinion is slighly better than Gildersleeves which earned 100 score in melodicrock.com.<br /><br />Opening track THAT's WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT really represents how D2's music is great at. GHOST OF LOVE is one of the best tracks in their whole career. It really has great hook with excellent bridge. KILLING LOVE is a power ballad similar in style as 80s rock bands such as Foreigner or Loverboy. HEARTS ON THE HIGHWAY is again crisp rocker worthy of extensive radio airplay. FUGITIVE is impressive acoustic ballad while the next track KEEP ON KEEPING ON is a sure-fire hit track. ROCKET TO YOUR HEART is another bomber. And the closing track DIRTY MIND is a great uptempo track which should be airplayed much more.<br /><br />Verdict: Great comeback worthy of class of 1989 rock fans attention.<br />Rating: 97 out of 100<br />Recommended for late 80s to early 90s rock fans.
B00164GDE6|5.0|out of all the action film buddy movies smith and lawrence are the best this movie is fantastic so good
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I struggle to find one good thing to say about this movie. The special effects were alright, but ultimately hey were deployed with little impact. Ridley, how did you manage to trip and fall during your victory lap?
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. It explains the world; why societies have failed and what is necessary to allow them to succeed. It should be mandatory reading in High School and again in College. It should certainly be required by all politicians.
0547564651|4.0|Why are we always so quick to reject the wisdom of older people as outdated? Don't we always come back around and take another look and find they were right after all?<br /><br />Paul Tough takes a look at new research on children who grow up to find success in their adult lives and shares with us the New Version of an Old Truth: hard work means a lot.<br /><br />My grandfather is quietly nodding his head.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|A horrible movie and a terrible waste of time.  The more I see of Seth Macfarlane's work the more I am convinced only he is entertained.
