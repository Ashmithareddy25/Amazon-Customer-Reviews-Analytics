B00005JMNA|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE MOVIE! the dancing in it was fantastic! i think the first dirty dancing was better, but this one went right along with it! and i was totally surprised when patrick swazey appeared in it! i was so happy! i love him! but the acting and the dancing and music and settings in it were wonderful! 2 thumbs up!
B00003CXTG|4.0|The special effects of this monumental world event are stupendous.  The fictionalized soap opera story of the three sexy young leads, however, is mind-numbing cliche that seems to last longer than the war itself.  This is why \\"Scene Selection\\" was created!<br />Fortunately, history buffs will be able to enjoy the battle scenes and the wonderful Bonus Features including a \\"Making Of\\" special and a History Channel documentary.<br />However, if you really want the best of the Pearl Harbor movie experiences, check out TORA! TORA! TORA!
B000088E6D|5.0|If you love the sound of a true pure crooning voice Bubl is that man..........<BR>Thrilling discovery for all of us who love the kind of music where words and lyrics do indeed have meaning.<BR>In a way that I can only describe as sensual, Bubl powerfully sings his way through this spectacular cd. I couldn't say that I enjoyed one song any more than another, for as you will hear, each is unique, and each one is so artfully orchestrated and sung that picking any one 'best' would be impossible.<BR>I rate this cd as the best one I've ever heard, and so will you!
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings films, and my admiration for Howard Shore is very well-known among my friends.  This soundtrack fully proves why.  His score is breathtakingly memorable, incorporating the familiar main theme, as well as the Rohan and Gondorian themes, into such tracks as \\"The Grey Havens\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\", a track which features Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) singing to the people of Gondor in Elvish.  It is one of my favorite tracks on the entire CD.<br />Another standout is \\"Minas Tirith\\", which brings tears to my eyes each time I hear it, not from sadness but sheer triumph.  \\"The Steward of Gondor\\", which features Billy Boyd (Pippin), is stunning.  Here, Boyd's earnest voice is lovely and also has me reaching for the Kleenex.<br />Shore is assisted by many other wonderful performers as Ben del Maestro, Renee Fleming, Sir James Galway, and the incomparable Annie Lennox, who does a splendid job with the closing theme \\"Into the West\\", which most definitely deserved its Best Original Song Oscar.  The same goes for Howard's original score win.  The musicians are phenomenal under his direction.<br />If you are a hardcore fan like myself, you will catch yourself recognizing which scenes in the movie go with which song.  This soundtrack is a MUST HAVE for any fan of this film.  You will not be disappointed.<br />The bonus DVD is also incredible and definitely worth the price of the CD.  It gives wonderful insight into the making of the score and Howard's talent as a composer/conductor.<br />I'd never cried at a film score until until the scores for the LOTR films, and the fact that he evokes such emotions within me is proof, at least to me, that Howard Shore IS a genius.<br />Pure and simple.
1582432678|5.0|I read this one sllloowwllly - both because I had &quot;a feeling&quot; the worst was going to be realized and because Lionel's writing is so fabulous, I didn't want to see it end.<br />Do *not* miss this one.
0780021150|5.0|The city of Berlin (during pre-WWII Germany) is wrought with hysteria as a cunning child-killer stalks the streets.  To hasten the capture of the murderer, the police clamp down tightly on local criminal activity, making business-as-usual activities nearly impossible for members of the city's organized-crime syndicate.  So in an effort to return the city to its previously permissive state of affairs, the local mobsters decide to hunt down the elusive homicidal pedophile themselves.<br />This compelling study of a pedophilic serial killer and the public reaction to his odious crimes was decades ahead of its time in its treatment of psychological, political, and sociological themes.  The first \\"talkie\\" from pioneering auteur Fritz Lang--probably better known to fans of classic cinema as the director and artistic force behind 1927's groundbreaking, trendsetting silent SF classic METROPOLIS--1931's M is more than just a crime thriller.  It is actually a subtle comment on the sense of security that modern \\"civilized\\" people so blithely accept.  Lang so effectively blurs the line separating institutions of law from crime syndicates that he leaves viewers questioning whether or not society's leaders are actually capable of keeping its citizens safe and secure.  And indeed, Lang had good reason to pose such a question, as the Nazis were already on the rise in Germany at the time he was making M.  The film barely veils Lang's disgust for the Germany of that period--a Germany that could birth and foster a philosophy of hatred like Nazism--since the Berlin he depicts is dark with dirt and grime and the people all seem to have bloated, gnarly faces that are twisted into perpetual scowls.  That being the case, it is no surprise to learn that Lang employed actual Berlin residents and real-life members of the city's criminal underground to fill several supporting roles.<br />M is also notable as the film that launched Peter Lorre into the international spotlight.  Lorre's gutwrenchingly emotive portrayal of a human monster who is unable to control his evil, deviant sexual impulses is nothing short of stellar.  Unfortunately, this performance also resulted in his being typecast, and it was afterwards difficult for him to secure roles outside of the noir or horror genres, even after his emigration to Hollywood.<br />Released the same year as Tod Browning's classic Lugosi vehicle, DRACULA, M is actually the scarier of the two.  Although Lang's intention was for M to reflect the decaying and diseased society that WAS Germany during the years that culminated with World War II, it reflects just as poignantly the anger, violence, and social ambiguity so prevalent in today's world.  And that is very frightening indeed.<br />The Criterion Collection DVD offers a visually stunning restored version of M in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and at its original 111-minute running time.  The disc plays the film with the original German-language soundtrack, but optional English subtitles are available.  Unlike many Criterion discs, there are no additional bonus features, but the opportunity to watch this remarkable and historic film as its legendary director intended makes amazon.com's less-than-suggested-retail price very reasonable.  Definitely a must-see for students of cinema, aficionados of classic films, and fans of the noir or thriller genres.hingly emotive portrayal of a human monster who is unable to control his evil, deviant sexual impulses is nothing short of stellar.

B00018D44U|5.0|So many second efforts from budding artists are disappointments--not so this CD from Norah Jones! She managed to maintian her melodic style and showcase her distinctive voice, and yet give us something different enough from her first album to still be interesting. I have it on repeat in my CD player as my new dinner party music. LOVE IT!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Hey there, <br />This movie has an awesome storyline and keeps you &quot;tuned in&quot; from beginning to end ..... as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I know my little 20 month old did too ..... as she watched the screen constantly (who doesn't need 2 hours break, when they've got a kid??)! <br />Personally, from a parental point of view, this movie isn't too scary for your kids, and the excellent animation and story will keep them spellbound - a hard thing to do these days!<br />This is one of my favourite movies becasue it is just such a &quot;nice&quot; movie to watch!  The voices are excellently placed, and the characters a joy to watch.<br />You won't be disappointed if you watch this one!
B00005JMCN|1.0|This was one of the worst movies that I have ever had to suffer through.  All of the performances were over done, (with the exception of Chris Cooper, who is always top notch) and the entire movie was cheesier than consession stand nachos.  I am completely confused at all of the accolades that this movie has received.  The true story had much more depth; they barely touched on the horse trainers alcohol problem, nor the battle with eating disorders/substance abuse that Tobey Maguire's character went through.  The glossed-over finished product struggled so hard to be &quot;heart-warming&quot; in every scene that the potentially touching story lost all validity.  Basically, it sucked.
B0000DCGT5|4.0|(...) In my opinion, American Wedding is absolutely hilarious (in parts) and the storyline moves along pretty quickly ..... contrary to what other reviewers might have said, I think that the parts with Stifler in them where so funny!<br />This should have been the movie to follow American Pie - I was a little disappointed in the storyline to American Pie II, whilst Tara Reid is a great actress I thought the storyline around her was somewhat flat and not at all funny .... which meant that American Pie II had some real downer moments ...... this is definitely not the case with American Pie the Wedding!<br />This movie has it all .... Jim, Jim's dad (he is really good in this one), Stifler, Finch and Stfler's mum, and a really, really funny bachelor party (and for you guys out there, lots and lots of breasts! or \\"boobs\\"), and even has a \\"granny\\" scene (not to be missed - I won't say anymore other than a granny and Stifler - what do you think happened?).<br />This movie made me laugh out loud ..... and I think that's what a good comedy can do!  So, I say, rent it, borrow it, buy it - hey just watch it ...... I don't think you'll be disappointed! I give this one an A+.<br />PS if you don't have a sense of humour don't bother to get it out ..... you will be disappointed!
078681859X|5.0|I'll keep this short. This is an awesome book. If you have any ideas about it being some kind of Harry Potter repeat, forget them and go buy books one of the Bartimaeus Trilogy. When I first saw it, and started reading it, I hadn't even thought about it being an attempt to copy H.P. And although I'd be a liar if I said this book wasn't at all similiar to the Harry Potter series, it's a book all in it's own (as many other reviewers have mentioned) and should defintley be on your must read list.
0140067477|5.0|This book is a little gem, especially when you are feeling lost spiritually. It teaches one a lot about Eastern Philosophy, meditation and just (like a brook) taking things smoothily and easily. I loved and so have all the friends to whom I have gifted this little volume of wisdom.
0385504209|2.0|This was a really disappointing book.  I enjoyed &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, and from the first few pages this book was just too similar.  It seemed like an obvious attempt to capitalize on the formula.<br />I'm not concerned either way by the religious issues, by the way, and I'm no grail scholar.  That said, the puzzles were insultingly simple.  How long can it take for a cryptologist to recognize a Fibonacci series?  Does anyone not know that Da Vinci was known for using mirror-image handwriting?  The big puzzle at the end of the book (I won't spoil this one for you) was introduced fully 100 pages before it was solved, but as soon as the full poem was printed (after 10 pages) the answer was obvious.  I spent the next 90 pages hoping that the answer would be something more clever, but it was exactly as I thought.  Am I some sort of puzzle-solving genius?  Not likely.  I know plenty of people better at it than I am.<br />If you haven't read &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and try not to think too hard, you might like this book.
B00004WC6J|4.0|I had a couple David Sylvian tracks here and there and I liked them very much so I figured this CD was a good place to start investigationg David's music.  It's a double edge sword that this album feels like a consisant 2 cd release instead of a collection of 15yrs of musical releases.  It's good in the fact that the styles of the songs don't feel disjointed or make radical changes.  Overall the cds are calmy, mellow and sometimes very good.  But the bad side to this is that I can't believe that a musical artist can't innovate their style over 15yrs of music.<br />Some of the best tracks on this collection are rare pieces that appear on compilation cds or released on somebody else's CD.<br />Overall this is a worthy buy as I really like David's baritone voice which reminds me very much of the Aluminum Group's vocals but with better guitar work and very nice strings and/or horns worked into the music.
0061015725|3.0|Michael Crichton is one of the most popular authors in the world. His books sell in the millions and he has legions of fans all eagerly awaiting the latest from this author of JURASSIC PARK. What is his secret? What is the key to his popularity? Aspiring thriller writers would do well to try to answer these questions.<BR>     Jack Forman is currently a stay at home dad raising three children- the youngest being an infant. He fears his wife, who works long hours and behaves suspiciously, is having an affair. That is until he learns exactly what kind of work she is involved in. Jack, a computer programmer by trade, led a group of programmers in developing a program that would create a biological process in the computer that could interact with and solve real world problems. There is an accident in the Nevada desert and Jack is called in on a temporary assignment to handle a group of nanoparticles that appear to be taking on a life of its own. The problem is the particles are programming themselves to hunt down and kill both animals and humans. They are, in effect, the predators and the humans are the prey.<BR>     Once again, Michael Crichton returns to the world in which science has gone awry in a terrible but somewhat plausible way. The strength of a Crichton novel rests with the way he can move the action along while keeping the reader engrossed in the story. In the beginning we meet the main characters and set up the scientific basis for the upcoming disaster. We then proceed rather quickly into the action packed central aspect of the story. Episodes get shorter and move quicker. The last sentence of each episode almost forces the reader to keep going-- phrases such as, &quot;I'm afraid we have big problems, Jack.&quot; Or &quot;Listening to her, I couldn't help but worry.&quot;<BR>     So it is a given that PREY will hold the reader's attention throughout. I had a problem with the plausibility of the nanoparticles organizing into a cohesive and destructive swarm.Their abilities appeared to be more and more outrageous as the story progressed. Characters were stereotypes, yet, adequate for this type of a book. Overall, well written and entertaining, but, lacking in any semblance of realism.
0385504209|4.0|I prefer biographical or legal non-fiction; heretofore, the only two series of fiction I've read are Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe detective novels and the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series by Lahaye &amp; Jenkins.  You can imagine why I enjoyed &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; so much.<br />If you like history, art, religion, mystery, or puzzles you will enjoy spending a few hours with Robert Langdon.

006054094X|1.0|Oh, boy! This enormous example of what Samuel Eliot Morison called &quot;moonstruck history&quot; is a poorly edited, contradictory and irksome argument that the Chinese voyages of 1420 and following went not only to Africa, as Louise Levathes and others have documented, but circled the earth including treks to near the North and South Poles and planted colonies in North and South America. Menzies' book is a pretty good example of how easy it is to mislead people who don't know how professionals do historical and archeological work. <BR>An example: Menzies makes a big deal about the Cherokee rose, the state flower of Georgia, which is Chinese in origin. He claims that its presence in early America proves Chinese voyages before Columbus. In fact, the rose was introduced from China in 1759 and spread widely.<BR>Sometimes the readiness of this British Navy captain to grasp any straw, so long as it's a rice straw, borders on the crazy.  His &quot;reconstruction&quot; of Chinese &quot;voyages&quot; to the Caribbean depends on the view of certain coasts being exactly the same, with harbors, sandbars and winds that never change (thus, the maps which are the majority of his &quot;evidence&quot; are decipherable to him because of his decades of experience as a sub captain, when professional historians never noticed these &quot;similarities&quot;).  However, his Chinese admirals were able to sail around Greenland (in wooden-hulled junks) because the ice had melted in a warm period.  Make up your mind, Menzies!  If the water was one fathom lower (in his chapter on Bermuda, where the sea-concreted stones are a Chinese engineering work) then how could the view from sea level be the same, as he claims in the beginning of the book? And a sub captain sees a *different* view than a junk's lookout atop a tall mast!<BR>This book is nonsense, I'm sorry. Louise Levathes and several other scholars have made the same judgement. Read her fine book and ignore this.<BR>The website, with such&quot;evidence&quot; as urns found in Oregon (as if there were no dollar stores in Oregon  to supply them) and &quot;giant cometary impacts&quot; as explanations for the ships sinking (of course, Europeans were too stupid to notice a huge natural disaster!) is an embarrassment.
B0000DCGT3|2.0|For fans wanting to see the next step in the lives of this group, your view will be slightly skewed.  Although the other characters are there, they seem to be more of a background and motivation for the character of Stifler.  Kevin, played by Thomas Ian Nicholas, says very little throughout the entire movie.  Jason Biggs, playing the future groom, does not have the big role you'd think he'd get.  Alyson Hannigan also has a small role.  Chris Klein absent from the movie altogether and is not even mentioned.<br />Since he stole the show, my guess is that the filmmakers decided to give his Seann William Scott, \\"Stifler,\\" more screen time.  As a result, he doesn't fit with the movie.  Although important to the plot, the gags seem to be formulaic.  If his ingesting something disgusting was funny before, it should be funny now.  This time, however, it is a bit less believable.<br />Eugene Levy is always a treat, but even he couldn't save this one.  I felt this would provide closure, but the movie was a bit disappointing.  I would not recommend this unless you are renting it.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|A lot of people complain about the special editions, some as if<BR>they where completely different films from the originals. I for one like the changes and additions for the most part, most of all, the Jabba The Hutt scene with Han Solo in the first film.<BR>After all, it is the way George Lucas intended it to be, and they<BR>are his films. And I can't wait for the DVDs in September.
B00003CXWV|3.0|Looking at the cover, I expected to see a bit more of Penelope Cruz; however, her role, although pivotal, was minor compared to Johnny Depp.  Johnny Depp shows how the life and times of the convicted drug dealer George Jung aged and changed him.<br />The typical movie about drug lords and dealers tend to be stark and violent.  Even though this movie has its share of violence, the movie humanizes Jung to show depth and feeling.  We see his motivations and concerns.  Although we don't condone the behavior, we have a better insight into why this happens.<br />The DVD has some interview footage with Jung to provide the viewer with some background information.  I found this interesting, but Jung is not very animated, which can be expected from the long time spent in prison.<br />I would recommend this movie.
B000003TAW|5.0|It's been almost ten years since this album was released but I have never grown tired of listening to it.  The song melodies are catchy and the lyrics are thought-provoking.  The Blue Album is one of the best works to come out of the mid-1990s and was the perfect alternative to grunge.  In my opinion, an outstanding collection of songs!
B0001I561E|5.0|I've been waiting for SO long for Aladdin to come out on DVD! Finally!! Now I'm counting down!! It is my all time fave Disney movie, ever!! I never get tired of it. Its funny, cute, any kid would enjoy it. The music is wonderful as well.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I am a 26yo female who owns more R&amp;B CD's than Rap, but after listening to College Dropout I had to go and get it for myself. On top of Kanye having good looks, he is very gifted and talented when it comes to laying down the tracks. Now he's no Jay-Z but he still gets to the point. It's obvious he dropped out of college to pursue his dream in the music business but if you really listen to what he's saying in some of the songs you can see that he's a very bright guy. Congratulations Kanye, you are on your way to the top.
B0000D96NW|3.0|I expected much more from this CD based on the reviews I read before I got it from overseas. If MH wouldn't have released The Burning Red and Supercharger(and I wish they wouldn't have), this would have been a logical progression with the new line-up. I expected a little more from the songs since Demmel and Flynn are back together. The songs are well-written and show the growth of the band although they come across as trying to be little 'epics'. I think Flynn's attempts at melodic vocals are admirable but he sounds better when he barks his lyrics. He conveys alot more emotion that way. Overall, this is a well done CD, it just doesn't have the unique MH sound that Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change have, I hear too many influences and sounds of other bands for it to be a favorite of mine. If you're just getting into MH,this is a good primer. Just make sure you get their first 2 CDs as well.
0446677450|5.0|It's about time that someone with mega credibility like Robert Kiyosaki explodes the myth of a college education. I have many friends who spent thousands on a college education only to spend thousands more and then thousands more and today are poounding the pavement trying to find a job just like the one they just got downsized from.<br />I also know many people who  have lost their homes to foreclosure and therefore their life savings because they were dupted into thinking that a home was a &quot;asset.&quot;<br />Kiyosaki's advice is right on. He is telling it like it is. It may not be what you want to hear and it may be opposed to what you were taught by early mentors, but let me ask you a question; how are those mentors doing? <br />Let me ask you another question: have you ever been mentored by a rich person before? Kiyosaki gives you that chance. Use it or lose it. The choice is yours.<br />I also recommend Rich Dad's Success Stories to get the full and true story of how Kiyosaki has positively impacted the lives of others.<br />His system works. Try it. You'll love it.
1401300901|3.0|I read this book while on vacation and found just what I wanted, a book to make me think about how precious life is, while not causing too much thought.  It caused me to appreciate my husband more.  While you can tell that the book is written by a young, unmarried woman she provides some depth to the joys and sorrows of loving another so deeply.  If you are looking for divine inspiration, this book is not for you, but if you are looking for a lighter read with some depth-- then pick it up!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation for me is the perfect movie.  It uses none of the Hollywood cliches found so often and instead tells its story in its own way.  Reading a summary of the story, one would have trouble understanding why this film has garnered so much praise, yet upon viewing it is obvious.  <br />The characters relate in such a way that you are almost there with them as they blossom their relationships.   Sofia Coppola has crafted a wonderful experience that slowly takes shape over the 100 or so minutes before it ends.  I have a feeling this is a semi-autobiographical story in a lot of ways, but if that's what it takes for a writer to build something like this, more power to her.   I give her credit for putting her own life into the mix when necessary, yet still creating new fiction that helps the story reach such a powerful peak.  <br />Some of the characters are a bit &quot;thin&quot;, such as Charlotte's husband, but the emotion displayed by Johansson tell all that is missing from his role.  The same effect is there when Bill Murray talks to his never seen wife on the telephone.  I just loved how this movie never had to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator to get the story across.  The scenes with Scarlett and Bill (which encompass most of the film) are so subtle, but at the same time powerful, that I was completely into it the whole time.  <br />This film tells me that American film can compete with the great films of Europe when the correct ingredients are present.  Unfortunately this film is rare for American films.  Watching the Oscars last night almost left me sad to see Bill Murray come up short in the best actor category.  Then again, acting awards are completely ridiculous as all roles are subjective and cannot be compared.  Also, I have seen enough of the Academy Awards to realize that the prize usually goes to the most over the top acting out there.  <br />I guess this is rambling but if it helps another film lover to see this film, I have done my job.  Enjoy it (or not) and go from there.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|i must have seen this movie 20 times on cable and still watch it every time i can!<BR>cant wait to own the dvd.
0375413405|5.0|Every recipe I have made from this book has been amazing!  I would not, however, recommend it for anyone looking for quick or cheap recipes or those uninterested in cooking.  Julia is serious with her art, and it is art!  These recipes are fairly complex and many of them involve looking at two or three different recipes at a time.  However, they are worth every bit of effort.<br />I really loved the beginning of the book, too.  I learned some new things about my ingredients!  The beef stew was absolutely succulent, and the mornay sauce was beyond words.  I would not have thought it possible for me to make such things at home, but I was surprised every time!
B00011RPB0|5.0|I am almost sorry for those who dislike this film--what bigoted mentality do you have, in which small-minded environment do you live not to realize the charm and wit of this film and its protagonists?? Orange County or the like? Bah!!!
B00009XITP|4.0|What can I say! Amanda Bynes Shines! She's a breath of fresh air in a world where many of the teenagers portrayed on TV and in films seem totally fake, but Amanda glows with originality and a \\"I'm Not Trying To Be Britney\\" attitude. Refreshing indeed.<br />The movie is about a girl named Daphne (Bynes) who knows that she's missing out on an important aspect of her life-- a relationship with the father she's never met. Her offbeat, rocker mother (played by Kelly Preston) isn't sure about letting Daphne go off into the \\"real world\\" to find her dad, considering that she was burned a long time ago by him (Well, according to her). But Daphne goes to England anyway, finds him, and tries to be the kind of daughter she thinks he wants, sacrificing her originality. <br />Colin Firth is really funny and cute in this movie. He always impresses me, especially with his expressionate eyes, which reveal a million different emotions. Awesome supporting cast as well, plus a cutie newcomer named Oliver James, who even sings in the film (and yes, that's really him singing). <br />Bottom line- Great movie for teen girls and I believe there is room for this movie to stretch to a wider audience besides just teen girls. Definitely check this one out, you won't be sorry.
6304467583|5.0|Incredible saga from start to finish. From the rise of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro as young Vito, Marlon Brando as old Vito), to the rise and devastating fall of Michael (Hauntingly played by Al Pacino),The Godfather Trilogy is incredible (Even the last one, with the badly miscast Sofia Coppola). The Corleones are the ultimate anti-heroes: you want to root for them to bump off their enemies, and yet, they are also the bad guys. You even root for Sonny (Wickedly played by James Caan), when he beats up his abusive brother-in-law. They also suffer from betrayal from within the family: Fredo (Wonderfully acted by the late John Cazale), betrays his brother Michael just so he could have a little something for himself. Michael's reaction to Fredo's betrayal is heartbreaking. It's too bad that this is not delved more deeply in the final chapter instead of putting in plots that go nowhere (The fling between Bridget Fonda and Andy Garcia simply goes nowhere at all). All in all, the trilogy deals with loss: From the loss of Vito's family, to the loss of Michael's soul when he takes over the family business. This film is a must have in your collection.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|I can't believe that the studio would crop down the original story by two hours!  More importantly, there is absolutely no indication on Amazon's product page that it is not the complete and original version.  Obviously we are supposed to buy first and be disappointed later.  Shame on the studio for dismembering such an admirably filmed and classic western.  Shame on Amazon for not letting us know that this isn't the complete film.<br />For those of you who had never seen the film and bought this DVD, I'm sorry to tell you that you've been snubbed out of 1/4 of the story.  For those of you who loved the film and bought this DVD, don't you feel cheated?<br />This isn't the first time a studio has decided what is best for the viewing public.  I, for one, will be demanding to know why this film was cut and how/where I can obtain a quality (this DVD quality was awful) and UNABRIDGED digital video of Lonesome Dove.
B000003S09|4.0|Yeah, this is one of the prog-rock masterpieces that everyone ought to own.  The best song is \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\"...when the chorus fires off it sends shivers down my spine, and unlike a lot of good music, this one has the decency to last for quite a bit.  But it's really hard to say much about this album that hasn't been said.<br />So why a point off for Moonchild?  First off, the 'good' 2 and a half minutes aren't even all that good...it would still be the weakest on the album.  But if the 10 minutes of random ambient improv is included on an all-time classic, it would lead one to believe that it's only a classic because the few songs that are on it are good.  It's too anti-climatic a song for my tastes.  Now King Crimson does this improv stuff alot on their records, but the thing is, there's usually some good payoff at the end, like in Red's \\"Providence\\".  This just didn't have it within the song...the best part is when it ends.<br />True, all the other four tracks are masterpieces, but, with the exception of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", they don't really change up too much.  Not that it's a bad album, in fact, the ten minutes of randomness are almost kind of a cool-down from the exciting \\"Epitaph\\".  Yet, it still leaves you wanting more, at least another song or two.  <br />However, I'd still recommend this to everybody, especially those new to King Crimson.  Greg Lake is the best vocalist they ever had.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson does it again! On and On is just as good as Brushfire Fairytales. Although its more mellow, its still a solid album. Fans of Brushfire Fairytales will love On and On. It might sound kind of dull at first, but just give it a few listens and you'll be convinced that this is an awesome album. If you are new to Jack, get Brushfire Fairytales.
B000000HTK|5.0|The 1975 comeback album \\"Godbluff\\" is the album that puts the other prog giants (Pink Floyd, ELP, Yes, etc.) to bed, and that's no bluff.  This album is absolutely relentless in its emotional intensity and lyrical profundity.  It must be noted that Hammill isn't merely a singer, but a PERFORMER of lyrics, which is what lines like \\"If all is lost none is known/and how can we lose what we've never owned?\\" demand.  Being a long-time hardcore Pink Floyd fan, it really means something when I say Peter Hammill really makes a dwarf of Roger Waters on this album (particularly in execution). While the other big names were running on autopilot by this time, \\"Godbluff\\" really makes the others pale in comparison. VDGG arrived to kick major ass on all fronts with a vengeance.<br />The opener \\"The Undercover Man\\" creeps along with Hammill whispering in the shadows, building suspense before the song opens up with a reflective & confessional soliloquy.  The band always supplying the perfect canvas for Hammill to paint his lyrics to profound effect, which become universally addressed by the end of the piece.  <br />Like a restless ocean wave comes \\"Scorched Earth\\", beautifully segued from the opening track.  The song builds with Evans' drumming really punctuating the intensity that soon reaches its tantric release.  Banton's modified Hammond sounds downright frightful during the heavy angular riffs (this music would've scare the crap out of me as a child), which again help convey Hammill's wrath with lines like \\"It's far too late to turn, unless it's to stone\\".  The band then goes into an absolutely frenzy, demanding that the listener turn his stereo up well into the red (and well past 11).  Hammill's guitar abuse at the end is absolutely perfect.<br />\\"Arrow\\" begins with a jazzy schizophrenic vibe (with wah-wah sax) before easing into the opening chords.  Hammill is absolutely manic on this track (which I have blaring as I write), with lyrics full of helplessness & wrath. Jackson'ssax sounds great & easily replaces the electric guitar.  Actually, I couldn't even imagine a guitar on this album - too much intensity.<br />Finally, we meet \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" with a very mathmatical interplay between Banton & Evans.  The song has many incredible movements & a great build with Jackson really coming to the fore. The song grows to orgasmic proportions with Jackson really taking the song to new heights.  It's really something to hear Hammill lose his mind in the background just before he explodes into \\"Tonight, before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleep...\\".  Of course, this part should be cranked up to infinity to feel the full effects (or affects) of his wrath.<br />I obviously have profound feelings for this album and recommend that when you buy (and yes you WILL buy it) this one, it must be played at full volume everyday.  We should get a petition going to have this & other VDGG albums digitally remastered (any feedback on this?). This band really makes the other prog giants appear as SLEEPWALKERS.
078681859X|5.0|This book was amazing!  It starts out really fast, then gets slightly slow, but not for long.  The plot twists this way and that way and keeps you hooked.  If you're not sure you'll like this book, trust me.  My favorite books are artemis fowl, harry potter, lord of the rings, and the wind on fire, and the pendragon series but this ranks tops out of all of those.  I can't wait till the next one comes out.  <br />The magic in this book was completely new and original so it was really good.  Not only that but it's got a mysterious plot that keeps you guessing.  The character development is great and I love all the new ideas in it.  It's a really super awesome, incredible, magical, fantastical book!!!!
B000084T18|4.0|If you were to ask for my opinion on this album,I would have to say that not only the hip-hop world wasn't ready for 50 cent,but it goes for the entire world.He's changes the rap game.He tells it for what it's worth which is &quot;THE TRUTH&quot;.The content of is lauguage &amp; choice of words tell us that he's versitile &amp; can do it any way possible.I beleive he'll never have another album like the 1st,not because of talent,but this album is a master piece itself with associates such as Eminem &amp; Dr.Dre &amp; the entire Shady/Aftermath camp.The streets are behind you &amp; want  you to continously stay # 1 on the charts.There isn't anybody left in the game that can match up to you,so good for it all 50 cent,you have the world in the palm of your hand.NEXT TIME YOU'RE ON BET,GIVE ME A SHOUT OUT OR LET ME BE IN A VIDEO.GOD BLESS &amp; MUCH SUCCESS.

B0001AP12G|5.0|When I first put this in all I could say was OH SH*T!!! I promise to God this CD is probably the best to come out in '04. Kanye West definitely has his own unique style and he brings something new to the game instead of all that so called &quot;gangsta rap&quot; that everybody else has already brought to the table. He approaches new subjects such as family, God, stuff other rappers have been too afraid to do until now. I say Kanye is definitely the best on the ROC after HOV. He has a lot of talent as a beat maker and a rapper. All I can say is good job to rocafella for signing him! &quot;Here's to the ROC&quot;!!!<br />BEST SONGS ON THE CD:<br />1. We don't care<BR>2. All Falls Down<BR>3. Never let me down<BR>4. Get 'em high<BR>5. Workout Plan (funny as HE*L!!)<BR>6. Breathe In, Breathe Out<BR>7. Two Words<BR>8. Through the Wire<BR>9. Family Business<br />All the other songs are excellent and the skits are hilarious but these stood out to me the most!
B000066NW0|1.0|wow, i can't believe this occupies the radio these days. i remember when canadian talent was considered to be IME, the tea party, rush- real bands, not freaking avril. people and bands like avril stop real artists, GOOD artists from getting a chance to carry on or even begin a music career because the radio is clogged with this crap; there isn't any room in the tight rotation of avril, fefe, good charlotte (aka &quot;mediocre green day&quot; - CR), simple plan, and other soulless bands. if you want to help save radio, music and yourself DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. However if you wish to continue to take it up the ass from the recording industry and their little puppet, radio, go right ahead but remember that you're going to go to hell for it. cheers
B000002B1M|4.0|The year is 1996, hip hop's darkest era. Nas was representin' QB at the time with his fellow comrades, AZ, Mobb Deep, Cormega and Nature. This album was the transformation of Nas as he formed The Firm, with AZ, Nature/Cormega &amp; Foxy Brown. This album may not be Illmatic, but still deserves recoginition. The production was tight and the MC talent was all there. The only disapointing thing about the album is the track, &quot;Nas Is Coming&quot;. Since the track was produced by Dre, you'd expect better production, other than that, the album is still good. Nas drops his nasty persona and begins to make the pathway to Escobar.
B00005JMEW|3.0|THis was a great film, though it was drastically edited for the American Audiances. You would think that for the dvd release he would have added all of the stuff he was forced to remove and colorized the fight scenes - which were only black and white in America. The other countries were able to see the film as actually intended in full color and bloody. It's disappointing that the DVD release didnot include the true version of the film...
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Some reviewers apparently hated this movie so much they have reviewed it several times giving it a lower score each time. I say move on to something you like and don't try to ruin a movie that has truly touched the heart of so many baby-boomers. Diane Keaton is simply marvelous as a middle-aged woman who falls in love for the first time. Few have the talent to move effortlessly  between comedy and drama, but Ms. Keaton does. She makes you laugh one minute and touches your heart the next. Perhaps her success in this film will show the studios that just because she has passed fifty doesn't mean that her incredible and delightful talent has diminished in the least.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I just recieved my DVD set yesterday and I have watched 4 hours of it already. I don't know why people are complaining about this set. The sound, the picture, everything, is just how I remember it from back when it was on tv. People should stop whining about the fact that there aren't any special features - you get the WHOLE series! It took so long for them to actually release this - we should rejoice, not complain! I won't go on and on about how great the show is, because so many before me have done so, but I will say that this DVD set is awesome! I love it, and have no regrets in buying it. Take it from me, this is a MUST HAVE set for any TRUE My So-Called Life Fan!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Well there's a lot of things to say about Mars Volta's full lenght debut<BR> - it's heavy,dark,psychedelic,full of abstaraction,breathtaking,monumental,trippy,not radio-friendly,original,masterpiece,extravagant etc. <br />Almost each reviewer praises this record.And the fact is that...nobody ever did music like this...Yes,you can switch &quot;no,this was not a helpfull review&quot; remembering some other new psychedelic progressive artists but only Mars Volta did a heavy progressive album without making a lot of guitar solos ala Steve Vai and huge wall of sound ala Dream Theater. Yes,Omar Rodriguez is phenomenal guitar player but he dose no show his abbilities in normal way - his style is created with many effects,wierd chords and a lot of more but remains unbeatable at the moment.Vocalist is amazingly original (although some of you might remember him from At-the drive in band).rhythm section is floating over whole melodies (check out hte beginning of &quot;roulette dares&quot;)...<BR>all compositions are brilliant,&quot;de luosed...&quot; is actually a concept album about a voyage in sobconcious of a man which is laying in coma - all songs are connected somehow to each other so the album seems very solid and no track is unnecesary.<BR>Mars volta's style is fusion of Rush,early pink floyd,screamo,hard rock and progressive metal.it is hard to say in one word what the band is play8ing.but it is hwat no one has played before.<br />&quot;de loused in comatorium&quot; is a complete trip -it will surely grow on you after few listenings.well,it is really really amazing album!
B00005NGZX|5.0|Greatest band ever here.  Petitioning The Empty Sky is much better, but this is good stuff.
B000002U82|5.0|What can one say about DSOTM which hasn't been said already? It's practically common knowledge that this is one of the greatest recorded pieces you can find anywhere. Like the title reads, to say that this is a masterpiece is an understatement. Recorded 30 years ago, this album still shows up on contemporary charts, and for good reason. The heartbeat introduction and closing perfectly frame a dizzying array of human emotion and profound interpretation. Whether you're into instrumentals, lyrics, or musical atmosphere, this album has everything you could possibly want. Listen to it from beginning to end and you're likely to find the mood uncanny. Recommended with great enthusiasm.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Una vez ms, la Sarah que conocemos no nos decepciona. Este albm es una mezcla entre: &quot;Fumbling towards ecstasy&quot; y &quot;Surfacing&quot;Por qu?.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|A film by Darren Aronofsky<br />This is a powerful movie.  While on one hand it would be simplistic to say that this is a movie about drugs, it is also necessary and accurate to say that the movie is about drugs.  It would be just as accurate to say the movie is about addiction.  This movie is broken up into three stages: Summer, Fall, and Winter.  Each stage tracks the descent of the characters into addiction and we watch as their lives fall apart.<br />This is the story of four people: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  We start the movie with our characters about to improve their lives.  After Sara receives a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on television she is obsessed with losing weight and fitting into a dress that she wore years ago.  She sees a doctor that was recommended by a friend (the doctor seems like a quack doctor, however), and begins taking diet pills.  Harry and Tyrone have a plan to start dealing some higher quality drugs and make money so they can buy some of the highest quality cocaine and sell that and make serious money.  Marion is along for the ride and has dreams of her own about designing clothing.  At first everything is working fine and we are in the Summer period of the story where everything is at its brightest and warmest and most positive.  But it isn't to last.<br />Harry recognizes that the diet pills that his mother are taking are nothing more than speed, with a downer to help her sleep at night.  He sees the signs of addiction and that she is starting to become strung out, but all she can see is that she is losing weight.  Harry and Tyrone are experiencing great success, but it is all starting to turn sour.  The rest of the movie is the slow (though at times rapid) descent into addiction and the repercussions of the drug addiction and lives they are leading.  There are arrests and Marion is now willing to trade her body for drugs since Harry is not able to provide her with the drugs she needs.  It keeps getting worse and worse and spiraling out of control for all four characters and the end of the movie doesn't give them redemption, but rather rock bottom.<br />As I said, this is a powerful movie, but by no means is this film an uplifting movie.  Things start bad, improve a little it and just get worse from there.  This is a harrowing look at drug addiction and there is no truly sympathetic character whom I care for and hope things turn around for.  What this movie does have are fantastic acting performances from everyone involved (though I am somewhat less impressed with Connelly).  I have been impressed with both of Araonofsky's movies (the other being \\"Pi\\"), but they have both been emotionally gloomy pictures.  I look forward to seeing what he does next and while I think this is an excellent movie, I think I'll be okay never seeing it again.ow willing to trade her body for drugs since Harry is not able to provide her with the drugs she needs.

B00009TB5G|5.0|We all know that special features are a very important part of the DVD buying experience.  This DVD will keep you busy (and interested) for hours.  Long after you've watched this extraordinary epic, you will continue to be entertained by the entire cast and crew of the Lord of the Rings.  DVD editions like this are the reason we have DVD players.  If you don't own this movie yet, or if you own the standard edition of The Two Towers, please, please buy this special edition for your collection.
B00013F38K|1.0|Bruce Lee would have been perfect for this role.  But bigotry was strong during the olden days and david carradine was cast instead.  david's Kung Fu skills were weak and such a horrible actor.  This movie gives a bad name to Kung Fu.   If you really want to see some real Kung Fu, do your self a favor and pick up some Bruce Lee or Jet Li flicks.  Save your movie and skip this one.

B000002HPT|5.0|I don't know why I didn't see it before.  When I bought FALLING INTO INFINITY over a couple of years ago, I enjoyed it but not enough to keep it running in my CD player constantly, the way I did with SCENES FROM A MEMORY, IMAGES &amp; WORDS, and AWAKE.  FII was sitting on my record shelf for quite some time, but recently I have re-discovered the album and realize its genius.  This is quite possibly the most diverse and tasteful recording Dream Theater has ever done, and considering the constant pressure they were under from their record label Elektra at the time, they defied the odds and still managed to release an album of solid material.<br />Speaking of diversity, I was just amazed how so many musical styles are on this album.  I'm surprised I didn't see it or hear it the first time.  You get a little bit of everything of what makes DT great on this album: from the progressive epics (&quot;New Millennium,&quot; &quot;Lines in the Sand,&quot; &quot;Trial of Tears&quot;), to the ballads (&quot;Hollow Years,&quot; &quot;Take Away My Pain,&quot; &quot;Anna Lee&quot;), to the crunchy heavy metal (&quot;Peruvian Skies,&quot; &quot;Burning My Soul&quot;), to straight-up hard rock (&quot;Just Let Me Breathe,&quot; &quot;You Not Me&quot;), and the token instrumental (&quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot;), just about anything you can think of is on here.  Not to mention that there are traces of funk during &quot;Lines in the Sand,&quot; a Latin-inspired acoustic riff that plays throughout &quot;Hollow Years,&quot; and nice use of odd times in &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; and wind chimes in &quot;Trial of Tears&quot; which are reminiscent of Rush's &quot;Xanadu.&quot;  You get all of that and a bag of chips.<br />Some have complained that the lyrics are not as good as on previous albums, but I beg to differ.  A lot of the songs are here contain some of the band's best lyrics ever...okay, maybe &quot;You Not Me&quot; and &quot;Burning My Soul&quot; is stretching it a bit, but the rest are all fantastic.  John Myung writes some truly deep and meaningful words on &quot;Trial of Tears,&quot; James LaBrie's lyrics on &quot;Anna Lee&quot; are really emotional as well, and John Petrucci's lyrics are just as sharp and intelligent as ever on &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Take Away My Pain.&quot;  Speaking of Petrucci, his guitar work has never been better.  His heart-wrenching solos on &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot; and &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; are amazing, and he's constantly trying new sounds on almost every track.  Not even Kevin Shirley's slightly watered-down production can get rid of the power of his performance.<br />FALLING INTO INFINITY is the most underrated masterpiece of Dream Theater's catalogue.  Even the band, like me, is starting to take notice and respect the album a lot more.  Over the past two tours, including the still-going TRAIN OF THOUGHT tour, they brought back some songs from FII that they haven't played in a while.  Good for them.  It may not have the best production or the best overall theme, but FII can match wits with just about anything in DT's discography.

068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a tale of an American born boy who moves to Ireland as a small child. The book reveals his entire life. Francis McCourt, son of Angela and Malachy of Limerick Ireland. WIth a family if constantly changing numbers Francies battles through the worst challenges that the Irish slums can throw at him. Malachy is a depressed alcaholic who never holds a job for more than 2 weeks. Even when he does work he drinks away his pay check and leaves his family to suffer through life without his assistance. Angela is severly depressed and doesn't know herself well enough to know her own children or anyone else either. Francis is her first child, one of 8 he soon learned the value of being independent and remaining primarily self sufficient. Around age 7 he takes on the role of taking care of his younger siblings. With no heat, shoes, shabby clothes, little to no food and a life of eviction and confusion Francis rose above all the odds to concor his dreams of moving to America and making a better life for himself and his family if he couuld. By working hard and getting any job he could he tried to save everyone, espeacially himself.<BR>         I highly applaud this book and think that everyone should read it at least once in their life. The story reveals remarkable clarity and unique perspectives of a world seldom explored by choice and all too often overlooked. The new view of an old clishe flows with interesting details and remarkable feats. Life is constantly changing and this book reveals the details of survival in a harsh world where life is often taken for granted and things are worse than they appear. The inncent clarity on the bitter reality proves the true intention of the book. Not to change the reality of that life but to realize its there, perhaps not as obvious as it once was but it is still present and will remain so for a long time to come. The book wasn't perfect but it was the truth. The hardest part for me was reading Angela's views and decisions. I think her hope was sadly misplaced and often did more harm than good. Being optomistic in the worst of situations is admirable but providing false hope when life repeats failure again and again only hurts those people.<BR>     This book is one that almost anyone could read and the vocabulary level is simple yet precise. Anyone is capable of reading this book and easily understanding the text as well as the underlying messages. I would highly recomend this book for everyone and think that it is a highly inteligent and informative. It is truly a wonderful book and a welcome addition to anyone's personal library.
0783240287|4.0|I was recently going through my movie collection and remembered how much I enjoyed this one. I was originally given it as a lone, but quickly knew I had to own it for myself. The music is very entertaining, the message in conveyed clearly and is an appropriate movie for kids of all ages. the only reason I gave this four stars was the sound quality of the DVD isn't so great. You really have to crank your set up to hear everything good. Otherwise, this is a great buy!
B000099T2L|3.0|Really wanted to give this a 3.5.  I bought this disc with no expectations other than curiosity about whether she would go the \\"neo-soul\\" route as promised or the \\"hip pop\\" route of other new school r&b divas.  I thought that the songs could have been presented differently so that the album doesn't seem so uneven - like why were all of the up-tempo songs presented first then the slow to mid-tempos?<br />Overall though, I like this cd but doubt that I'll be listening to it 2 years from now like I'll be listening to Alicia Keys' \\"Diary\\".<br />My fav tracks are: CIL (although really sick of the song now and cannot listen to it, initially I thought it was a powerhouse debut single), NG (sample but still catchy), BB (great summer dance song, Sean Paul MAKES this song hot IMO.  If he was not on it, it would have FLOPPED!), Hip Hop Star (very edgy), Be With You (I absoutely adore this song!) and MM&I

0345440900|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful!  She gives practical solutions to begin helping your baby eat and sleep with some consistency.  She is very pro breast and bottle feeding, but more importantly, she believes that right decision is whatever is best for the mother and child.  She discusses the two schools of thought on feeding and eating - one being those that believe that you feed the baby whenever he/she is hungry and let them sleep when and where they are most comfortable (ie - your arms, the rocking chair, the swing, car seat, etc)...the second being those parents that are guided only by the clock and by their schedule.  The author does not subscribe to either of these schools, rather she believes in a schedule driven method in order to help regulate the sleep/eat cycles of the baby, yet stresses the importance of the parent being flexible in order to accomodate the baby's needs.  I have incorporated most of her recommendations, and my baby is well-adjusted, happy, and sleeping through the night at 2 months!<br />The most important distinction she makes is that she does not believe that every baby is the same, and that all technigues work on all babies.  In fact, she gives 5 general descriptions of babies and provides guidance on how to deal with the personality of YOUR baby.  <br />I have read many books, including \\"Babywise,\\" \\"What to Expect in the First Year,\\" and \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block,\\" and by far I found this one had the most helpful information and practical solutions.

0763619612|5.0|This book was delivered automatically in our Junior Library Guild order, and it has become one of my all-time favorites as a librarian.<br />When Vashti angrily stabs a dot onto an empty art class assignment, her teacher wisely follows through with a lesson in life by framing her dot for all to see.<br />This little bit of attention takes Vashti to new heights by allowing her to take that dot and see where it leads her.  She paints all sorts of dots and gains new confidence.<br />What the story really teaches us is to try, and to start with the tiniest of dots to begin our journeys.  As my library class discussed the theme, many of the kids brought up \\"dots\\" in their own lives, such as learning how to roller skate, sink a free-throw, or turn a cartwheel.  We all have to start somewhere!<br />And as Vashti's teacher told her when she finished that first dot, \\"Sign it!\\"  <br />This little book is truly an inspiration, and the kids loved it.  I want my own copy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|700 people, well 699 minus the troll, is loud enough. This series is great tv, and great sci fi. Unless you work at FOX where if its not reality, its not fit to broadcast. Imagine if one of the craptastic reality shows was given this same poor treatment of being shown out of order.<br />Didnt notice if it was FOX that officially released this set, but if they did, and this show wasnt worth every penny, I would wish not a single copy would sell just to give FOX the finger. But what can you do? Its the best show you have never seen. So buy it.
B00002Z88D|1.0|the sound quality in this is attrocious. It has neither the charm of a live concert recording of Metallica, or the clarity of a symphony recording. The strings are mostly muddled by the feedback from the guitars. the old favorites are played with less enthusiasm or skill than on prior live recordings, and the new tracks were not worth the time or effort to listen to. No Leaf Clover??? WTF??? No point including it.<br />stay away, by the Binge and Purge, and you'll be happier.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|.....that I resisted giving Pink and her music a chance for a long time, mostly because of her moving from R&amp;B to alternative to rock/near-punk. I am not particularly a big rock &amp; roll fan, after all; R&amp;B is more my style. But I am glad I broke down a couple months ago and got all three of her CD's, because I was wrong-she is great! 'Try This' is just a great, feel-good album with a great mix of upbeat rock songs and pop ballads. It is a great party album (like her first effort, 'Can't Take Me Home') and it definitely has a much more positive feel and direction than her personal form of therapy 'Missundaztood' (though that was a good CD too). So in spite of my usual musical taste, I love this album a lot and I definitely recommend it to all fans who already own 'Can't Take Me Home' and 'Missundaztood'.
B000002HMH|3.0|This CD was supposed to be huge, it was a new direction, wait and see, Metallica was back, better than ever and they had learned some new things. well we found out that the downward spiral of metal gods starts with a big Load. this I guess is why the name of the album is so appropos. With a blood and Bull semen cover to start off with, we lost the lyrics sheets, and about half the songs sucked. None of them really sounded like old school metallica. Now some of us felt that it was reasonable, you can't make the exact same music as you once had in youth, 20 years later. And some of the tracks are actually very good when not held up as Metallica songs. But we all felt somewhat betrayed by this one, and then moreso by the follow up.<br />I know unpopular as it sounds, Mama Said is one of my favorite songs on the album, probably because the singles for Mama Said had such AWESOME live tracks. but this is the end of the Load for Metallica fans. go any further and see the dearth of worthwhile music.
0385504209|1.0| <br />I have the greatest affinity with the philosophical and spiritual message put forth by this book's author. Yet I wish that a truly talented novelist (like Tom Robbins) had gotten hold of this particular plot and enmeshed it with the required amount of erudite research. As things stand, the Da Vinci Code makes the action novels I used to read as a 10-year old (that was in the 1950's) appear like beacons of litterary achievement.<br />It's not only that the flow of absurdities and logical incoherences in the plot makes you wonder whether the man (or for that matter, his editor) has reread his writing before sending it to the printing press. What actually really annoyed me was the inconsistency of an author who probably did spend a few weeks in Europe, but couldn't be bothered doing his research properly - on the probable assumption that his American market wouldn't notice the difference.<br />A few ridiculous cases in point: Interpol having real-time information on hotel guests over Europe, based on the forms filled at hotel receptions? A man arrested in France, but jailed in Andorra? Railroad tracks in Andorra? A 20th century French cop exclaiming \\"Jesu\\" [sic]? The \\"French king Godefroi de Bouillon\\"!? A Swiss bank operating by the rules of Swiss banking on French soil? The \\"Captain\\" [?] of the French police giving orders to the police in Kent? A bright French girl who never had noticed that her grandfather's \\"château\\" had a cellar? And who as an adult is so deeply ridden by neurosis that she won't speak to him ever again after catching him in the midst of a sexual act?<br />As they say where Dan Brown comes from, \\"Give me a break, please...\\"<br />The result is rather distressing: in the face of such obvious flaws, we are entitled to wonder whether the book's apparent erudition is to be taken at face value, with its distinct feel of a patchwork collection of esoteric issues. I am not overly familiar with these matters, but other readers have questioned the validity of its historical research too. I am afraid that the very praiseworthy message underlying this work will be lost on those who, intellectually speaking, could profit most from it.<br />And I, for one, will not be looking forward to the sequel. Nor to reading Dan Brown's previous books, if they happen to be in the same vein.<br /> dity of its historical research too.

B000002H2H|4.0|This is one of Metallica's pure best. Classic songs, good lyrics, adrenaline, and youth. The band was really coming together with this one. No MTV to sell to, little real radio support, this was the boys pounding out some of their best songs. Some of them are a little rough around the edges, production quality and musicianship reached its best with the next album, but this one is very good.
B0000039PW|5.0|CLASSIC ALBUM! TOP 1- RECOMENDATION! ONE OF HIP-HOPS BEST ALBUMS (BESIDES THOSE OF 2-PAC)
B000002H6C|3.0|I like 3 of the 9 songs. they sound good, they certainly rock, but for some reason I don't like this album. The cover is classic, The band was fairly good, but I don't think that they were quite comfortable with Jason yet, so most of the music sounds like it hadn't really been well put together or thought out.
B0001AP12G|5.0|After hearing the entire album, I must say that it is a great <BR>album.  There had been speculation about Jay-z's retirement and Kayne West involvement.  There is no doubt that Kayne West and mix a beat, but his lyrics are like no other.  I love the entire album but through this song I believe everyone can relate to what he is saying and even has an aunt(relative)home that you don't choose to eat at their home and possibly even we know someone in jail or has died.  Basically, it is his skills that has made him an success.  I recommend that everyone should go out and get the album.
B000002HRE|2.0|Don't kid yourself, Metallica knew which songs were good from teh load sessions and put them on load. 3 songs on this album are actually 20-40% worth listening to, the rest are pure trash.<br />I also hated that the booklet was just someone's idea of artistry, instead of lyrics, and credits and band photos that had been standard fair before. Do we really need a second cover in a row designed with blood and bull semen? if you don't believe that's what it it, read the articles around when it was released. This just proves someone was out of their head to release this trash.
B000002NIW|5.0|Around the fur will always be one of my favorite cds because deftones were the first band i ever listened to that could actually blend rap and metal well. I can remember playing this cd all day when i bought it. The best tracks on this album would have to be My own summer, Lotion, and Mx. The way Chino blends emotional and eerie vocals with heavy screams and makes it sound so good is amazing, Abe's drums are magical and stephen carpenter is one of the best guitar players out there right now. A definite classic.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is much cleaner and better produced than any of the prior offerings. It's got better lyrics and better musicianship than any of the later releases. THis was Metallica at its height. They were only poised to fall. Metallica had a sharp rise. Kill 'em all was a strong start, Ride the lightning was a very very good follow up, with Master of Puppets being the single most completely listenable album they released.
1591391105|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Sun Tzu's &quot;The Art of War&quot; is a classic read on accomplishing your goals as a leader.  Where Sun Tsu tells you how to wage the war, Watkin's tell you how to wage and win the first and most crucial task of it.  Best of all, Watkin's book is very straightforward and easy to understand.  No bravado, no bull, no self-inflated ego like so many &quot;leadership&quot; books.<br />Some of his points will make you say, &quot;Duh! Everybody should know that&quot; but he combines those items with other insights that are useful and worthy of consideration. Are you prone to action?  Great! What if the leadership role you're taking is with a team that's already successful and you need to build the case to be better?  Do you know what the early win is then?  What if the team is just starting to stumble but in denial? Do you know your blind spot as a leader?  This book answers those questions. <br />The book doesn't provide a sure to fail cookie cutter plan. It provides some needed mental pokes for you to create action items, checkpoints and items to review for yourself. It'll help clarify what your real goals are stepping into a given situation, establish your plan and speed your way to self reinforcing success.  Simply, it's excellent reading for anybody taking a new position at any level.
B00000FCBC|3.0|When this CD came out, I already had half the tracks, the entire second CD, from buying Garage Days Revisited, Garage Days Re-revisited, and a slew of singles. For the most part these tracks are great, and were on the original material that they reissued it from. The first CD was mainly trash. They're slowing down, and making mincemeat of other bands songs. <br />I give this a 3 because the one CD is good, and includes some hard to find bonus tracks that not a lot of newer fans would have a chance to find on the original source from Metallica. But you're kidding yourself if you think that Disk 1 is better than anything released before Load.
B00001U03Q|5.0|Here is a second volume of Eric Clapton's very best. This collection covers Clapton's hits from 1985 to when this album was released in 1999. It could have used I GOT A ROCK AND ROLL HEART from 1983's MONEY AND CIGARETTES. BLUE EYES BLUE is an original track and was a hit. CHANGE THE WORLD is from the soundtrack album to the 1996 movie &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. MY FATHER'S EYES and RIVER OF TEARS are from 1998's PILGRIM. TEARS IN HEAVEN is from the 1991 or '92 movie &quot;Rush&quot;. It was written for his toddler son Conor who died after falling from a multi-story window(this happened on March 30,1991 which was Clapton's 46th birthday). LAYLA is live from 1992's UNPLUGGED,which was on hit parade the same year. The original version was recorded by Derek And The Dominoes in 1970 and appears on THE CREAM OF CLAPTON. Also from UNPLUGGED is a JOURNEYMAN track entitled RUNNING ON FAITH. From JOURNEYMAN is BAD LOVE,BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME and PRETENDING. FOREVER MAN is a hard rocker so is SHE'S WAITING,the latter produced by Phil Collins. IT'S IN THE WAY THAT YOU USE IT is from 1986's AUGUST and the movie soundtrack to &quot;The Color Of Money&quot;,released that same year. (I) GET LOST is an original track from the 1999 movie &quot;The Story Of Us&quot;. That one is ideal for nightclubs and those who dance.
B000001FQ8|5.0|Personally, Big Daddy is my favorite JM album. It is a little on the lean side in terms of recording minutes (each song is quite short), but it is strong on tunes and lyrics. It is much more laid-back than JM's earlier work and he has retained the folk instruments of The Lonesome Jubilee. People may say that lyrically he is being clichd and rehashing his previous work, but I really like this album. Apparently (and obviously from the cover photo and title) JM was feeling reflective as a father, and it helps.<BR>The title track is a catchy little song. The next two tracks are listed as singles on my cassette copy of the album, but they aren't my favorites. The two story-songs, \\"Theo and Weird Henry\\" and \\"Jackie Brown\\" are what hooked me. \\"Jackie Brown\\" especially got a lot of airplay in South Africa. It's a sad song about growing up poor and dying alone and almost forgotten.<BR>Side two is actually the stronger part of the album. \\"Pop Singer\\" was the first single, JM's ironic look at himself. I just love the tracks \\"Void in My Heart\\" and \\"Mansions in Heaven.\\" Those are tunes I never get tired of hearing. When I have come across this album in a jukebox, those are the two songs I put money in to hear first. Mellencamp also has his political commentary here. \\"Country Gentleman\\" and \\"J.M.'s Question\\" lament the greed and the poverty of the late `80s. The CD also has a bonus track I have not heard in its entirety.
630512762X|4.0|John Travolta and Nicholas Cage make for a good team with this film. I've never been a huge Nic Cage fan, but i'm glad I bought this film on dvd. It gets a bit bloody at times, but it more than makes up for it with superb performances by Travolta and Cage! I can't even remember how many times i've seen this film. If you like good action movies that have a real story behind them, this film is the one to get.
0553213105|5.0|I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years.  It inspired me greatly, maybe because I identified with Darcy, and thought that I could be a hero, too.  For whatever reason, I enjoyed it thorougly.
B00005JMNA|5.0|This is a great movie, especially for someone of Cuban descent such as myself. The love story was great, which is hard to find these days in a movie. Even though the movie was filmed in Puerto Rico, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights has nothing to the contrary that it was filmed in Cuba. Music was somewhat modern, but it didn't take away from the movie itself at all. Diego Luna and Romola Garai were fabulous, each adding their own personality to the roles they played. Every person should see this movie at least once! Whether it's the dancing, the music, or the story, every person who sees the movie will walk out having something from it they'll never forget!
B00015HVI8|5.0|This season of Stargate is one of my alltime favorite purchases from the internet or even from a store.  This show is awesome, and is highly recommended.  I also got great value and benefitted from the books \\"Wisdom Daddy Taught Me\\" and \\"Secrets of Sensual Lovemaking\\" and the video \\"Rawfully Good,\\" and the awesome instructional dvd \\"New Sex Now.\\"  <br />I would enthusiasticly advise any of my friends to buy all of the above.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a superb DVD which faithfully reproduces Georges finest work. There is a minimum of re-interpretation. The musicianship throughout is fabulous as is in most cases, the singing <BR>My favourites are Billy Preston's version of 'My Sweet Lord'and Gary Brooker's version of 'Old Brown Shoe'. In both cases the vocals are strong and dare I say it better than the original versions by George<BR>Eric Clapton's and Paul McCartneys version of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is superb and close to the original and Jeff Lynne's version of 'The Inner Light'adds a melodic dimension  to that song which is lost in the original's production. Joe Brown's vesion of 'Here Comes the Sun' is close to the original and very pleasing.<BR>Whilst I understand Paul McCartney's reasons for playing 'Something' on ukelele, frankly it detracts from the song and its only half way through where the song transposes to the origanal version that it becomes enjoyable.<BR>I found Tom Petty's version of 'Taxman' and 'I Need You' the only weak and disappointing part of the DVD. That stated however, this DVD and no doubt the CD version of the same, is a fine addition to anyone's George Harrison collection. I have been playing it continuously since I bought it two weeks ago.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is kind of movie that you yawn during it, but can't live without after you finish the journey.  It's all about loneliness.  General americans cannot understand the deepest loneliness.  You think lonely is when you are alone in the house and talking to yourself?  No, the deepest loneliness is when you are in a crowd and no one talks to you, no one touches you, and even no one looks at you.  They are all occupied by their business and have no slightest interest in you.  The loneliness is even deepened when the environment surround you are so beautiful, and you have no one to share with.  When I watched the DVD alone in my apartment and had a couple laugh, I realized I made the right choice moving to the States, because I was there.  I am too familiar with the loneliness.  As such, I don't think this film will have any luck when release in Asia, because the film is just about the daily life of people there.
B000084T18|1.0|Id rather wipe my A$$ with broken glass than listen to this album. 14 tracks of trash filled with references to god, guns, violence, and drugs, and not to much of anything else. the only thing that made him popular is the fact that he was shot 9 times. He brings nothing to the table in terms of skill or true rapping ability. If u want some decent hip hop check out Nas, del, or blackalicious. Dont waste even 50 cents on this album.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|As a filmmaker who has been involved on the production side of filming drama, documentaries and biographies for many years, I commend Mr. Morris, both for his command of the art and craft of storytelling and his savvy at choosing the perfect subject.<br />He has taken, what seems like a fairly simple way of filming and interviewing someone, namely Robert McNamara, former US Secretary of State, a most compelling, charismatic, complex and fascinating human being who has lived a life unlike most others, and Morris has created a centerpiece of pure cinema. Cinema meaning: emotion, drama, heartache, story, plot, character and many more elements that go into the telling of a good tale. <br />Credit also goes to Robert McNamara himself who has an epic story to tell, with the twist of a character dilemma caught in the trap of service to country, principles, conscience and right and wrong.<br />One is left with the dichotomy of not knowing what to think. We shake our heads in wonder at what seems to be the niceness of a fellow human being (McNamara) yet he astounds us at the horrendous atrocities he has been a party to. Three little words still churn repeatedly over and over in my head \\"We were wrong\\".  And without giving away any plot or suspense, this is what I think this film is all about.<br />Most people in government will never admit to being wrong. It takes a very special human being to be open and come clean. How many Generals and how many Secretaries of War will ever admit to being wrong, or Presidents for that matter?<br />Here we have a living human being (McNamara) who seems to march to the same drummer as all of us, yet, was subject to a high office grandeur that separated him from humanity itself and the delusion of incorruptibility, by simply thinking he was being right.<br />Seems to me that humanity will continue to make the same mistake again and again because that is who we are, egos hell bent on being right. Just look at the divisiveness of our politicallandscape that has everyone thinking they are right without really understanding the other side.<br />The Fog of War is an epic story very well told. Very timely.  Oscar well deserved. Philip Glass should have an Oscar for his great music soundtrack.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|When I first saw the trailer of the movie, I was expectiong a female version of The Dead Poets' Soceity, if not, The Emperor's Club. However, after watching it, the movie is not even close to be compared to their male counterparts. I am not saying school movies about females are worse than ones about males. What I am trying to say here is that if the movies are about female students, there are issues to talk about. Technically speaking, the direction and script will be more challenging in order to strike a balance. If this job is handled well, another great movie will be produced; if not, the movie will just become a flop, like Mona Lisa Smile.<br />This movie is too aggressive and the plots centres on too many characters, which confuses the audience on thinking about or even locating the pivot of the movie - the teacher, Katherine Waston (Julia Robets) or her students? The movie was set in the early 1950s, when the Second World War had finished for almost ten years and women were trying to find new roles in a society. The students in a traditional school were molded to be conservatives and traditionalists. Katherine Watson, as a bohemian, appeared and showed them new angles of looking at art and their lives. Her students did the pre-reading of the class and knew very well about the syllabus. Katherine, amazed and stunned by this, introduced contemporary art into the class. With this, she emphasized the destined roles of women should not be marriage anymore. Despite her effort, many of her students still sought refuge in marriage and romance, even herself. Half of the movie talked about her enlightenment on gender stereotypes, but everything seems to be futile and unfruitful when we see one student getting married after another. The movie fails to show the impact of Katherine Waston as a teacher on the students' lives. Even if the impact is a failure (as in The Emperor's Club), it still has to show her ideas fail. In other words, Katherine Waston and her students appear on screen as two separate entities. The movie is a jungle path through which it is trying to find its focus, and so is the audience.<br />The movie wastes the excellent cast - to a certain extent, I think Marcia Gay Harden is a miscast. She is the kind of emotionally rich and overflowing actress who took up Pollock and Mystic River. Her constraits in emotional expressions and manners fail to convince the audience. If the movie is made by a female director, things may be different. Another condition - if I was not a school teacher, I would not have given a pass for the movie.pear on screen as two separate entities.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Yeah well it took long enough to surface,but when it did..man it took my head off!! I can't believe how good these 2 dvd are!! The rumours and talk of an official dvd of the band live were racing about for years..to have the finished article in my hands was too good to believe! I've loved this band since the early 70's..i saw them at the second Knebworth in 1979 (and i saw Page and Plant at Wembley on The No Quarter Tour)..i must say they did come across as rather jaded and sloppy when i saw them..it didn't help a speaker going bang during The No Quarter keyboard solo and Page's string going during Achilles..i've seen numerous bootleg concerts through the years and of course TSRS..you can knock that all you like,but it was the only live footage we had of Zeppelin for years..till this dvd showed up...as for Page being sloppy..if you compare him to today's players he's ancient in his technique..and maybe just a bit rough..but he delivered the goods when he had to along with his 3 other cohorts...you have to remember the state Page was in by the late 70's health wise as well..i find it funny if Page is so sloppy and bad on guitar that Steve Vai rates him as his favourite guitarist...this dvd set allows us to look in on Zeppelin in a way we never could before..it would be impossible to site best bits as the whole thing is akin to a gift from the gods..and yes there are maybe too many camera shots for some,but this was left over footage and we should just be thankful it got released..it could all still be rotting away in a warehouse somewhere..Zeppelin were a leviathan of undreampt size and unfortunately in the end they imploded on themselves...they left a legacy of magical music and great performances..Buy it..and just enjoy the four of them take your skull apart!!
0345452577|2.0|Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware novels, and rightfully so. When an author wants to break from a popular character, there's always the possibility of scepticism from the readers. Some authors are able to make this work (Jeffrey Deaver, for example). Others fall flat, as Mr. Kellerman has on this one. I honestly don't know what happened here. This is perhaps the slowest paced novel I've ever read from a veteran author. How this ever got past his agent or editor I'll never know. You are well over halfway through the book before anything happens, and I'm not exaggerating here in the least. It's almost like following someone's boring life with morbid curiousity for a while, waiting for something to go wrong. The ending, when it mercifully comes, isn't worth the build up. The Conspiracy Club from the book's title really doesn't do anything that a single character couldn't have done. It's like this is a novel he'd written years ago but put away and suddenly he had a deadline and had to grab it. The potential for a great story was here, but it would have meant losing the first half of the book and starting from there. I look forward to his next novel, but I hope it'll be back to his old standard of great storytelling.
B000002HHB|5.0|Not too many albums can stand the test of time, and in case you haven't realized it, this album is approaching its tenth year, since it got released, yet it sounds as fresh as the first day. Natalie froze time and space in this this, her first album out of 10,000 Maniacs. So many people thought she'd been lost, when she left the band, yet everyone was happy to find that she was able to find her space in music on her own: the album came accross as very personal and down to earth, with an ability to be playful alternating with melancholic in a seamless way.<br />Having heard a few of the tracks in her highly recommendable live album, I was glad to listen to the original studio versions, and a few more tracks that I was unfamiliar with. Out of all the songs, &quot;River&quot; touches me beyond what all the other songs can, perhaps because it is her tribute to the passing of her friend. Perhaps this song, with its timeless name, captures the nature of the whole album: it never stops flowing and yet it remains true to itself in spite of the passing of time.
0140131558|2.0|When you read a book and whatever you are reading doesn't say anything is a waist of time, half of this book is written that way, maybe the stories are good, but when you read and read and nothing happen or explain things that you already know (Like all the names of the streets in NY city) I said that the grass is to green, why? Because everybody knows that the grass is green, you don't have to read it in a book, reading these kind of \\"grass\\" makes the story boring and you don't want to know what will happen in the real story of the book, this is a really waste of time, paper and money for this book.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I've discovered Godspeed You Black Emperor's discography in a backwards fashion. I picked up their 'Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven' album a couple of years ago and was fascinated by their ability to create such complex soundscapes in the course of album's four long pieces.<br />Today I faced 1998's work by the Montreal-based ten-piece ensemble, 'f#a# (infinity symbol)'. Notice that I used the term &quot;faced&quot;, because this is not precisely your ride-to-work type of music, which is what I like them in part: they challenge the listener, they invite him/her to get out of the comfort area, come close and LISTEN!<br />The album is definitely darker than their 'skinny fists...' album, and an indicator of their brilliance, how far ahead of their time they were six years ago: they were playing what today is labeled as post-rock, even before the term had been coined. Though I'd contend that I prefer 'skinny fists...' to this album, I have to say 'f#a#' has more than a few moments of brilliance.<br />They introduce the listener to a somewhat apocalyptic world with extended intros and samples of people and things leading into long songs (three of them, for a 60-minute long production) that last for what may seem like a musical eternity to most people. With the aid of a brilliant guitar work (by one or more of their three guitarists) layered on top of very rich atmospheres created by the two percussionists, strings (cello and violin), glockenspiel here and there, and further tape loops alongside the occasional bagpipes, the album results in a cratfy musical collage of a rather dark beauty that can be tough to appreciate if you don't give it a chance. As with your eyesight in a dark room, you need to give enough time for the album to sink in.<br />You may argue GYBE's view of the world back then (and these days too) is too dark and a little apocalyptic for your taste. While I respect that, I'd like to think that they're making a musical statement: there is quite a metaphor in their music inviting us to give ourselves more time, be more patient and develop a sense for things past the regular attention span that today's society has grown us accustomed to. Godspeed saves quite a few musical surprises within worth waiting for, to those who are patient enough to go past instant gratification.quite a metaphor in their music inviting us to give ourselves more time, be more patient and develop a sense for things past the regular attention span that today's society has grown us accustomed to.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|It is remarkable to me how well this film's appeal has held up over the years since its initial release more than 25 years ago. Ably directed by John Landis with a talented ensemble cast in which John Belushi (John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky) generates especially inspired mayhem, Animal House is within a tradition of earlier comedies, both on stage (dating back to ancient Greece) and on film (notably those directed by Preston Sturges), in which Irresponsible Youth and Civilized Society are in direct and constant conflict. In this instance, members of Delta House (anarchists and hedonists) versus the Omegas (prim and proper prudes) on the Faber College campus in 1962. The adversarial relationship between the two fraternities is exacerbated by Dean Vernon Wormer (brilliantly portrayed by John Vernon) who also seems determined to rid the college (if not the planet Earth) of the devilish Deltas. Rather than a carefully developed plot, Landis and the co-authors of the screenplay (who include Harold Ramis) prefer to present the action within a picaresque framework: one zany episode follows another as the Deltas' adventures evolve. Drunk or sober, Belushi (the pledge trainer, of course) and his fraternity brothers successfully reject all efforts to moderate their behavior. Sometimes life imitates art as when, following the release of this film, fraternities on campuses throughout the United States developed social activities (e.g. toga parties) no doubt inspired by the inmates of Delta House.<br />Then (1978) and now, I think the Dexter Lake Club incident is unnecessary, indeed a mistake. (Yes, that's Robert Cray among the members of Otis Day's band.) Also the illicit rendezvous with a group of young ladies from Emily Dickinson University seems superfluous. (Obviously, Emily is preferable to Fairleigh.)  However, the film ends with a brilliantly staged demolition by the Deltas of the town's annual Founder's Day parade. Be sure to remain for a brief but hilarious \\"Where are they now?\\" update. Within a relatively brief period of time, I saw both Animal House and Good News (1947) again. Both examine undergraduate life but that's about all they share in common. Those who plan to see Animal House for the first time (or again) are urged to see Good News first. It stars June Allyson (Connie Lane), Morris Ankrum (Dean Griswold), Tom Dugan (Pooch), Connie Gilchrist (Cora the Cook), Jane Green (Mrs. Drexel), and Peter Lawford (Tommy Marlowe). The portrayal of life on the Tait College campus in Good News establishes a frame-of-reference within which to appreciate even more the high level of satire at work throughout most (but not all) of Animal House.?\\" update.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|When I first finished seeing Lost in Translation, I thought to myself &quot;Hmm, this was good, but not good enough for even an Academy Award nomination&quot;. But then after a long while, the more I thought about it, the more I began to like it.<br />Lost in Translation made me feel like if I lived the movie itself, that I spent an hour and a half with characters that I enjoyed being with in a country that they couldn't understand.<br />The direction by Sofia Coppola reminds me a bit of the style Francois Truffaut shot his movies, it almost feels like a documentary.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson were excellent in their roles and had a lot of chemistry inside their well developed characters. <br />Also it was a funny, interesting and inspiring film, but sadly it's very hard for me to recommend to everybody, it certainly is one of the most different offerings that I had ever seen for cinema and it surely is destined for backlashing now that is gathering an audience after it's academy award nominations, but I can definetly see why many would find it slow or boring. But for those who disliked initially I would recommend to revisit it.<br />In the end, this was one of my favorite films of 2003.
B00008PRR9|5.0|Alot of people have had problems finding \\"A Quick One\\" in stereo. Here's the deal, your best bet is to buy the Polydor UK version of the CD. The artwork on the US MCA version is unchanged so it's impossible to know if it's the correct CD without taking the shrinkwrap off. Once you do that, you can't return it if it is the incorrect CD. With the Polydor import, all of the artwork on the package is the same (including the 1995 copyright date) EXCEPT for the catalog number on the binding. This will allow you to see if you have indeed received the correct CD without tearing the shrinkwrap off. <BR>Here are the different catalog numbers:<BR>* Polydor 527758-2 - maily mono<BR>* Polydor 589800-2 - mainly stereo<br />I hope this helps everybody!

B000000HTK|5.0|Easiest to listen to of all VDGG albums (in my humble opinion) and the one I use to introduce people to the horrors of Peter Hammill and friends.<br />Reformed for the second (or third) time, this was the best VDGG ever. &quot;Still LIfe&quot; is considered as Peters masterpiece and most think &quot;World Record&quot; was a dud.

B000002VCW|5.0|Year of The Cat: A song that's like fine wine, it betters with time. Time, one of AL STEWARTS FAVORITE COMPONENTS. Some may argue, some may merely disagree, but really, think about it. What song has it all, a musical masterpiece and where the lyrics take you to the mountains of Rio De Janeiro. Yes, they really do have trains there, and women that mystify the soul too. To ponder Stewart's mindset when composing the song! This song was indeed the gem of the seventies, when &quot;taking it easy&quot; not only brought Winslow, Az into view, but a whole new perspective, a whole new scene. One that only Al Stewart could so culminate into ecstasy. Yes, We all know the song, rock radio saw to that, but was it truly to be played after, or before, for that matter, just another rock song? No, this song was and is still special, much more special, as it has and will continue to make the listener listen just a little closer, and to stop and think of their Space in Time at that moment, or even a moment they might have missed. Enough of Zep's Stairway to Heaven, Year of The Cat by Al Stewart is my favorite of all time. A time when Britian gave so much to the worldwide music scene. As before, listen, but always dream, of a time, a place, the woman, the train. A Bogart movie and Peter Laurie, incence and patchouli, a hidden door and a river running through, the bus, the tourists, the rhythm of a new born day, The Year of The Cat....hmmm... Year of The Cat <br />Sincerly spoken,<br />True music fan, Alan
B000003S0P|5.0|This is killer Crimson - I saw the tour from this album and its the only time I have attended a concert at a large hall where people were yelling &quot;turn it down!&quot; Robert Fripp would simply take his hand off the guitar strings and the amplifiers would explode into distorted feedback. This is stuff to melt minds with-<br />Sadly, it was their last real album - and the KC that followed into he eighties is somewhat of a joke - I tried to like them but its no use, not when you've already been HERE.
0316666343|2.0|I was psyched to read this book because I heard that it was great, but when I actually started reading it, I thought it was boring.  It's interesting because it was from Susie's point of view but it was a little slow in places and the flashbacks could have been placed a little better
B000003S0I|5.0|I saw these guys  open for ......I cant even remember now. They were the opening act and I assumed it would be the King Crimson everyone hated (the Islands band). they came on like a sonic blast at full volume.It seamed like one long song for an hour and a half! I couldn't hear myself THINK for a couple of days after! It was a week or so before I started to get a handle on what it was I had seen. That was back in '72 and this was the most adventurous stuff I could imagine. Yes had not done &quot;Relayer&quot; yet. ELP had not done &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; yet. Genesis had not done &quot;the Lamb&quot; , even Mahavishnu was brand new. These guys really broke ground with this one. I remember seeing Crimson a couple of years later and at that time &quot;Easy Money&quot; would last 30 minutes and would get so loud in the middle , people would pass out from the volume- I'm not kidding.<br />Anyone that would read this much of a Kink Rimson review already has this album anyway!
B00011RPB0|2.0|hence, the whisper, that  frustratingly unintelligible whisper. I am dismayed that this poorly-written movie was not only nominated for a screenplay award, but it actually WON! It is just ludicrous.<br />Murray did not deserve that nomination (yes, he was humorous, in that deadpan way of his; when Johanssen laughed, I laughed, but that is not enough to garner an Oscar nod ). But even more so, Coppola did NOT deserve those three Oscar noms, and to WIN for Best Screenplay is just plain WRONG.<br />This is exactly a two-and-a-half star movie -- not great, not terrible, just exactly there in the middle. It is no wonder that many of these four and five star customer reviewers don't just review the movie, they also insult other customer reviewers. They obviously lack heart, just like the movie.
B000002KJQ|5.0|...Well this is probably ZZ Top's best album ever . Its not my personal favorite , but still really good .This was the album that saw them get some air play with &quot;La Grange&quot; and introduced ZZ Top to a much wider audience . Funny thing is though that when a lot of people where I lived first heard Billy Gibbons'vocals they didnt like the band because they thought the vocalist was black (seriously). But after seeing what the band looked liked loved 'em (a little weird isnt it) . Or better yet a few people swore that &quot;La Grange&quot; was T-bone Walker....Anyway you really cant go wrong buying this album , you will like something about it!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Let me say this: I love Sarah's music, and this is the first disc of her's I've bought. Now I don't know why so many wrote bad reviews- I loved this disc, and the only reason I rated it a 4 out of 5 is because some songs stood out more in my mind. My fav tracks were 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10. And the more I hear these songs, the more I like them. So give it a spin...or two, or three...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is a documentary about Japanese night life contrasted by some day-light tourist scenes.  The photographic work should have been nominated for the award, not the screenplay.

B00008EY9G|5.0|I'll try to keep this review as general as possible, as to not<br />give away too much of what I'm sure you would rather discover<br />for yourself. Take ten strangers. Strand them in a creepy run<br />down motel on a stormy night. Flood the roads, leaving no way to<br />excape, and let the killings begin. Much better plot than any<br />'JASON' or 'FREDDY' movie. It suspends reality and draws you<br />into it's dark, ever changing web as you try to guess who the<br />killer really is. There is a huge and wonderfully unique twist<br />coming. I will not give it away here, but I must warn you, some<br />other reviewers have given it away shamelessly. So read on to<br />other reviews carefully. While most reviewers respect the 'no<br />spoiler' rule, a few choose not to. But back to the movie. It is<br />very well acted, John Cusack is very good in the lead role, and<br />Ray Liotta gives the best performance I've seen out of him in a<br />long time. If you like good action packed suspense (I'm not sure<br />if I'd call it horror or not) I don't think you will be<br />disappointed. I hope my opinions on this movie hold true, and<br />that you will enjoy your ninety minutes with it.<br />Thanks and have fun,<br />Tom<br />(Yes, I think I will call it horror, but you can decide that<br />relatively unimportant detail for youself).
0780020685|5.0|Clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe.<br /><br />The basic story is extremely simple.  In a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest.  At first the farmers despair, but village elder Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring Samurai to defend them.  The villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince Samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) to undertake the defense.<br /><br />If the plot sounds familiar, it should: Hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN--but fine though that film is, it pales beside THE SEVEN SAMURAI, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry.  Much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated Toshiro Mifune (who would later appear in Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and YOJIMBO); above this, however, is Kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle.<br /><br />The circle is a powerful presence in SAMURAI.  The village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the Samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as Shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom.  The motif will be elaborated: tied to the cycle of seed time, growth time, and harvest; tied to the cycle of life; and ultimately showing the quiet bitterness of life for those who operate outside the circular codes of community: the &#34;Ronin,&#34; the Samurai who have no master and no community, and whose lives are not valued by the community except for aid at a moment of crisis.<br /><br />Shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, THE SEVEN SAMURAI is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review.  The quality of the Criterion DVD transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent.  There is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by Michael Jeck is quite fine.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewervalued by the community except for aid at a moment of crisis.

6305657939|3.0|The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 version) stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown, a bored billionaire art thief, and Rene Russo as Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator who goes after him, then falls in love with him.  Will Catherine do her job and nail Crown for stealing the Monet, or will she throw away her career for a life with her lover as a fugitive?  &quot;Fugitives with means,&quot; Crown tempts Catherine, &quot;that makes all the difference.&quot;<br />When it first came out, I liked this movie better than the original with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  The second time I watched it, wanting to zone out with a caper film, things bothered me almost from the beginning.<br />Don't read any more if you want to see the film, because I'm going to reveal the plot. But  I wanted to figure out what changed in my reactions to the movie, and why (I think) my reactions changed.<br />At a museum in New York a teacher is trying to interest her grade-school students in a painting.  She tells them it's the first Impressionist painting and is unique in the world.  They're bored.  When she tells them &quot;It's worth a hundred million dollars,&quot; they snap to attention, stare, and make noises of awe - -  not articulate speech, but animal sounds of transcendent bliss, like cows or sheep, as though they found themselves in the presence of a millionaire basketball star or pop singer.  In other words, what passes for religious experience in a culture that tolerates ignorance and worships money.<br />Crown has hired Romanian criminals to create a diversion while he personally steals a Monet.  He makes sure the Romanians are caught so he can get away.  He hides  the Monet in his townhouse behind another painting he legitimately owns and spends the evening drinking wine and basking in Monet's genius and his own brilliance.<br />Does Crown deserve to possess the painting because he's rich enough and smart enough to take it?  To be fair, Crown returns the painting almost immediately to the museum in a way that once again proves his superiority, but did he have the right to risk damage to such a masterpiece?  Anyway, my point here is that the first time I saw the move, it didn't even occur to me that Crown didn't have the right to risk the irreplaceable artwork.  Why not?<br />What about the Romanians?  They look like Eastern European movie thugs - -  shaved heads, sneers, but the equipment and tactics they use prove they're not stupid and they're not violent (though one does push a child, a way of making them less sympathetic).  While they knew the risks involved in such a theft when Crown hired them, they didn't know he was going to literally trip them up and send them to prison so he could steal &quot;his&quot; painting from a different room.  Why didn't Crown's betrayal of them even occur to me the first time I saw the movie?<br />We first see insurance investigator Catherine Banning when she picks one of the Romanians to interrogate.  (&quot;Give me the quiet one.&quot;)  Once she sees he understands German, she threatens him with the Securitate, Ceausescu's secret police, playfully walking behind her prisoner and stroking his neck, then pretending to snap it.<br />In this movie people are cattle for the amusement of superhumans like Crown and Catherine, his queen.<br />At this point I realized why these images didn't disturb me the first time I saw the film.  Then I was too busy trying to follow the plot.  In the interrogation scene I was trying to pick out enough German to understand what Catherine was saying.  During the heist at the museum I was trying to figure out the significance of Crown's briefcase and all the other gimmicks involved in the theft.<br />Later, Catherine learns that a young woman she thinks is Crown's girlfriend is really an art forger Crown has put through school.  Why?  Because her father (the young woman's tutor in forgery) is Crown's former partner, now in prison (for work he did for Crown?).  Crown has used his generosity to the young woman to involve her in his scheme.  Maybe she was going to be a forger anyway, but Crown is risking her freedom too.<br />Crown flies Catherine to his private island, where she throws a sealed painting onto the fire to prove she loves him over drinks.  I'm not sure how that proves she loves him.  Crown says it's not the stolen Monet, but a &quot;nice little Renoir.&quot;  Copy or original?  We don't find out for sure.  Again, Crown and Catherine play with irreplaceable art to spice up their erotic games.<br />In the climax we learn that Crown has surreptitiously replaced the Monet, but while he's confounding everyone with an army of look-alikes (their appearance taken from a famous painting) he steals another picture Catherine told him she liked.  (&quot;Everything's obtainable.&quot;)<br />The detective Catherine is working with lets her know he won't chase her if she runs away with Crown.  He can go back to arresting real criminals, instead of looking for stolen art that's really only important to some &quot;silly rich people.&quot;  How many people every year go to the Metropolitan, MOMA, the Louvre, the Orsay, the Pompidou, the Prado, the Reina Sofia, the Uffizi, the Tate,  the Rijksmuseum, just for starters?  How many are rich?<br />At last all the paintings are back where they belong and Crown and Catherine are together.  The first time I was glad for them.  But after Bush's tax cuts, Enron, and Haliburton, people like Tommy and Catherine just aren't as amusing as they used to be.has used his generosity to the young woman to involve her in his scheme.

B000003CMB|5.0|I distinctly remember the first time I heard this show. It was on a tape in a friends car during a 4 hour road trip. We had just enhaled some illegal plants and were feeling quite nice when he threw this in and told me to &quot;Check this crazy sh*t out.&quot;<BR>What came out of his nothing more then decent speakers for the next 2+ hours was musical madness. The guitar... thats what got me first. In my state of mind at the time it just sounded like psychadelic brilliance was flowing through my ears. I found myself grinning perfusely for the next 2 hours and laughing when I would hear Duane and Berry rip up a killer solo. The slide guitar is insane and the double drummers get you kicking your feet along with the beats. The organ is beautiful and the collection of songs is awesome. As soon as I heard this tape I rushed to get the cd. Coming from a music fanatic, especially a fanatic of music between 1960-1980, this has to be one of the best live shows I have ever heard... and thats saying something. Anyone interested in some killer Blues/Jazz/Country/Rock/Jam all fusioned together... please please please check this out.
B000000W5L|5.0|The most exilarating of all Stones' albums. It is inexplicable how such a degraded bunch of people could have been touched by God to record this masterpiece. It is a paradox that none of the 18 songs ever became a huge hit, but none is a filler either. The Stones just do what they want to: from the best boogie-woogie rock'n'roll in music history (Rip This Joint) to the African rhythms of Sweet Black Angie to the melancholic country sound of Sweet Virginia to the shattering rhythm-and-blues guitar wail in Stop Breaking Down to the gospel-sounding choruses of Tumbling Dice to the most successful Keith Richards' solo vocals (Happy) to those two pieces which pay Lord his real dues: Shine A Light, an unexpected anthem of redemption, and Just Wanna His Face, no more no less a true spiritual song in which the Stones hail the praises to Jesus... If you want to have a short compendium of all great styles that America gave birth to during the 20th century, the London guys from the Rolling Stones serve it to you in Exile on Main Street.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This CD is fabulous. It's definetely the best I've heard all year.  Gavin Degraw is an extremely talented singer/songwriter/ musician.  I could listen to this album all day!  Definetely one to buy!
B000000W5N|5.0|Mr Knopper should spend some time reading the booklets that the Stones are always too careful to fill with detailed info about who plays what. Sister Morphine is among the greatest songs of the Stones ever, true, but Mick Taylor DOES NOT play on it, the solo guitar is by Ry Cooder (lately famous with the Buena Vista Social Club project).
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I agree with every good thing that's been said about this film here by customers, but I have one caveat.  If you are a fan of the novels, as I am, you will likely be dissatisfied with the movie, not because it isn't a great film, which it is, but because it does a SEVERE lack of justice to the books.  And it's additionally annoying because Peter Weir got the hard stuff right, and the easy stuff wrong.  Russell Crowe was as perfect as probably possible for Jack Aubrey, but Paul Bettany was jaw-droppingly, unbelieveably wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Because of that, the script also had to be all wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Maturin is supposed to be tiny, dark, and ugly--he is half Irish and half Catalan Spanish.  He is physically uncoordinated and has a rather sour secretive disposition, with a tendency toward depression.  Because of the latter he is a drug addict.  But he is a fantastically erudite physician and polyglot, and a very successful spy for the British government.  The Patrick O'Brian books are just as much about the spying adventures of Maturin as they are about the sailing adventures of Aubrey, but because Paul Bettany could not possibly be convincing as anything more than a physician who doesn't know much about ships, half of what's good about the books had to be excised.  That is unfortunate, because the two characters have their own strengths and weaknesses and complement each other perfectly.  Read the books--they are far better.  And I guess we'll just have to wait for the BBC to do a series of movies a la Horatio Hornblower before anything like justice gets done to the books on film.
B0000CDL93|5.0|&quot;J.F.K.&quot; is Oliver Stone's opus magnum: a thrilling, taut investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. Did Oswald really pull the trigger that fateful afternoon in Dallas? Perhaps we'll never know. But the film is a potpouri of investigative threads and niche conspiracy theories that, at least for my money, hold more than an ounce of truth. At the very least it shoots holes in the Warren Commission Report which - for anyone who's read it - isn't hard to do.<BR>TRANSFER: This is the same stunning transfer that Warner Brothers gave us several years before as part of the Oliver Stone Collection. It's the director's cut. Colors are rich, fully saturated and well balanced. Black and contrast levels are solid. There is a subtle hint of edge enhancement and minor shimmering of fine details but neither will distract. The audio is 5.1 and powerful on every level.<BR>EXTRAS: Ah, here's the reason for the re-issue: the brilliant documentary, &quot;Behind The Conspiracy&quot; which is thought-provoking and chilling; sort of like Einstein meets The Silence of the Lambs. There's also all the DVD-ROM junket stuff that came with the previously issued disc. <BR>BOTTOM LINE: I had a hard time justifying buying this one again because the only extra feature not previously available was the documentary. But I believe this is a worth-while re-purchase for anyone who owns the previously issued DVD.

0385424736|5.0|The Rainmaker by John Grisham is a very exciting novel. I read it in the span of two days because I could not put it down. The story goes around a young lawyer named Rudy; a young lawyer who just passed his bar exam, and stressed out with the bill collectors. So now, he takes a case against a huge medical coverage company because they did not live up to the promise of one of their clients; he eventually died from lung cancer, and they didnt come through with the money to pay for the doctor bills. So now, they hire a huge law coporation to take the case. Now Rudy is over his head, but he wants to win this case because this could make him or break him in his law career. While the case moves forward, he meets what John Grisham calls 'a ambulance chase' and they start taking cases from other people, and Rudy still working on the medical case. Then Rudy meets a woman who is being abused by her boyfriend, so Rudy falls for and protects her from him. Now as the medical case moves along, eventually Rudy wins the case of $50 million dollars in grivence pay and medical bills. Rudy is happy winning his first case. Now he then finds out that the medical insurance went bankrupt and the family and Rudy would not see a penny coming their way. So now, with a old Volvo (it has I believe 130,000 miles on it, correct me if I am wrong), he then leaves the small firm he had with his buddy of his, and his new girlfriend and get out of town. <br />The Rainmaker I thought was a good book, I have not read all of Grisham's novels, but the few i did read (The Rainmaker is one of them), I felt like the man can write a good tale. I cant really call myself a huge Grisham fan, but I like his writing. Anyway, good book and definitely worth reading.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|All three soundtracks contain some of the most inspired, beautiful music ever created, but this one is the best for very strong, carrying songs that can suit differing tastes. If you get this, I highly recommend tracks 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 17, 18 and 19 if you like inspiring music (also check out the 2 minute mark of track 3 if you want some spine tingling vocals). For powerful action music, check out tracks 3, 7, 13, 15, and 16. For songs that gives you goosebumps and invokes of the black land of Mordor, listen to tracks 6, 9, 11, and 12. For sad songs that can bring tears to your eyes, listen to 5, and 8. Also, Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen have wonderful voices, and Annie Lennox takes your breath away. And if this isn't enough for you, get the other two soundtracks!

B00007BH5C|5.0|I love all three soundtracks, but I think this is the best one for songs that invokes images of Elves, and feelings of true inspiration. Track 8 is one of the most beautiful songs ever created in the world, and I listen to it endlessly. All tracks that features Rohan's theme in all it's varying forms (tracks 3, 6, 12, 15, 16) gets your heart pumping, especially as the Norwegian fiddle is playing. Tracks 11 and 14 (in edition to track 8) has the smooth, lyrical Elvish language of Sindarin sung wonderfully, and track 17 features Haldir's Lament, which is song in the High Elvish Quenya. Track 18 is as heart warming as it is bittersweet, and track 19, though it may seem out of place at first, truly describes the creature that is Gollum. Tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 13 are all excellent as well, many of them with strong chorals and astounding orchestration. And if you can get it, the extra track 20 (Farewell to Lorien) is a fantastic extension of track 15 (The Great River) from Fellowship of the Ring. I highly recommend this album (along with the other two)!
B000002IAS|5.0|The energy of this recording is amazing. Clapton is on fire and the whole band kicks out a strong set of gospel influenced rock and roll. Great stuff. If you like Clapton at his peak (first solo album, Derek and the Dominos) you'll want this. Other sets that this is related too include Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour (many of the same people on both) and early 70's Leon Russell.
B00018D44U|5.0|Hard to believe, but I like this album even better that the first. Every song on it appeals to me. I like the variety in the feel of the music, love the lyrics and her voice is liquid gold.
B00008EYA5|4.0|I've noticed S.W.A.T hasn't got that many positive reviews which I think is kinda sad.  Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell make a good duo in this fast paced action cop thriller.  Of course, another interesting thing about this movie is that unlike many cop related flicks, this one has a pg 13 rating.  Here's a run-down of the story.  Farrell is Jim Street who works on the swat team and his partner is Gambles.  Gambles is a troublemaker and Jim always covers up for his mistakes.  In the beginning of the movie, Gambles disobeyed the cheif's order and b/c of this a hostage gets shot and is sueing the state.  The cheifs has both men removed from the team, but since Jim was very cooperative with the cheif, he was given a chance to redeem himself.  This leads to a falling out between the two partners.  Luckily for Jim, Hondo(Samuel L. Jackson) the veteran swat leader was asked to assemble a team.  Hondo after watching Jim during tryouts was impressed with his abilities and decides that Jim was the perfect guy for the team b/c he had the skills and he disliked the chief just as much as he did.  During recruiting, Hondo selects Chris Sanchez, a woman who takes no crap from any one and has been trying for a long time to get on.  Chris is Michelle Rodriguez (&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;), James Todd Smith (L.L. Cool J), Brian Van Holt and Josh Charles completes the team. <BR>The pressure really is on Hondo b/c if he can't deliver a good time he and Jim are not kicked out of swat but off the force pd.<BR>For a long while, we see the swat team going thru training and celebrating after training.  Then the cheif put the team thru an real operation and they passed in flying colors.  Finally after countless hours training and reaching the level of expectation from the cheif.  The team gets their first assignment which is to escort a french drugdealer into the federal custody.  However, that turned out to be harder than they imaged.  The guy made 100,000 bond to help him escape.  As you would expect alot of people took him up on that offer but shockingly the people we is associated with are two former swat members and one of them was Gambles.  This lead to alot of finger pointing about who would be next to sell-out and help the guy.  The team was able to stop them from flying away after surviving shootings coming from a line of thugs.  The former partners fight each other which lead to Gambles getting ran over by a train, the other guy kills himself and the french drugdealer is back in custody.  If you read this review and still not sure if you want to buy it, then at least rent it.  I would recommend it.
B0000C9JCM|1.0|It is certainly a beautiful song, and the fifteen recordings are interesting and well done on their own, but make sure you know that you are buying a CD with the SAME song 15 times over, just with different instruments... Otherwise, like me, you will be disappointed.<BR>I would rather have a mix of all of Pachelbel's compositions with this among it, than one of them over and over and over again.
0767903862|5.0|This is terrific travel literature. I had never read Bryson before, but I cannot wait to read his other books. In this book, Bryson travels to Australia multiple time to see everything he can of the &quot;Sunburned Country,&quot; which proves to be an enormous, though empty, home to fascinating people, places and things. Using his terrific sense of humor, Bryson chronicles his tours through the cities and countryside, all the while stopping at every roadside attraction he can find. He also gives excellent historical background with adds rich texture to his stories. Bryson writes very well, tells engaging tales and really makes Australia look beautiful, welcoming and completely unique. <br />This is not an on-the-beaten-path tourist guide, rather it is a terrific journal of the real Australia that only ambitious tourists usually find, but he makes it seem like a wonderful place. I would recommend this as the first book for would be Australia visitors (it will make you very excited for your trip) or people looking for an introduction to Bryson. It is, however, a great book for anyone looking for an enjoyable book to read, regardless of their interest in the land down under and I would recommend its purchase to anyone.
B000002G87|5.0|One of the great albums in rock history.  Even more enjoyable when you know the story behind it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|\\"In The Zone\\" has to be one of the best albums of the year. In this cd Britney has certainly grown up and reached new heights in her creativity. The many different styles of music is a must in an album I feel as it keeps the listener interested and wanting more and this album does that!! With the first track \\"Me against the Music\\" feat, Madonna, its catchy dance beat and fun, exciting lyrics get you up and dancing and enjoying every minute of the song. The other songs on the album are also just as catchy and clever. \\" I got that Boom Boom\\" has the deep bass beat that just makes you want to get down and boogie with ppl that just wanna have a good dance. \\"Toxic\\" is exactly that! Once you have heard it you instantly love it. With its funky arrangement of string instruments and infatuating lyrics, it's a winner and no wonder it was the second single. \\"Outragous\\" produced by the clever R.Kelly temps you to be a little dirty with its fantastic  syncopated 'indie' beats and awesome bass. \\"Breath\\" is a sexy slow dance song which you can just sit back and relax to. If you like kylie or Danni than you will love this track! \\"Hook Up\\" is a fun, reggie styled track with an awesome bass guitar introduced in the first few seconds of the song which instantly attracts you to the song. \\"Brave New Girl\\" has that 80's retro beat to it. It makes you feel good and although it is a light hearted song it's still not to be overlooked. The slower songs on the album are also just as interesting as the fast tracks. \\"Everytime\\" is a soothing,calm song with its beautiful piano and harp arrangements. The lyrics are fantastic and in my opinion reflect largely to Britney and Justin's break up. This is song is one best tracks Britney has ever written. \\"Touch of my Hand\\" is a a great song just for the lyrics. It makes you appreciate being who you are and the oriental styled music compliments the lyrics beautifuly. Now before i sum up i have to mention the remix of \\"Me against the Music\\" It is FANTAStIC!! One of the best remix's that has ever been done to a song. It's funky middle eastern influence is excellent and amazingly clever. It is THE song to just get up and dance 'til yopu drop!! <br />Well there you have it. As you can see this album is a must. There are few other songs that I have not mentioned merely because I wont fit it all in. If you are over all the teen pop, well this album is the remedy! Britney has said good bye to all that and is now becoming a unique artist with her own flavour.
B000002HRE|2.0|Metallica has reached a low on this album that is only surpassed by St. Anger.  Most of the songs are uninspired and monotonous.  There are really only 3 good songs on the album (Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II) but even they are not typical Metallica songs from their trash days or even Load days.  Above all what is up with The Unforgiven II?  It sounds much like Unforgiven from the Black Album and has no apparent reason for being made.  Another complaint is that the recording quality is subpar.  Fuel seems to start off really weakly as do some of the other songs. And yet another complaint is the complete abandonment of powerful guitar rifts, instead we're left with 4 minute songs that exhibit a minimal of Metallica's legendary talent.  I miss the true Metallica.
B000060P79|5.0|well, this is one of my favorite CD's. i dont know why someone said that they cant write lyrics....they can. if u dont have the CD, how would u know they can't write lyrics? thats kinda judging them by the songs they put out. plus, with the lyrics of &quot;Perfect&quot;, that's the way alot of teenagers feel like...like they can never be good enough. so, yea. i dont know why anyone would say that. Simple Plan is one of my favorite bands! as soon as people saw that they were on MTV, they call them posers and stuff like that. u know how many other bands that alot of people like were once or now on MTV? like what about Blink 182...alotta people like them (including me) and their on MTV. and Rancid was on MTV before too...so their posers? anyways, about the CD, its one of my favorites definetely! Simple Plan is an awsome band, and this CD is too. i reccomend it!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Dr. is so far beyond any other film I've ever seen and while I don't believe in perfection in cinema, this comes very close.  It can be confusing and some might find it somewhat abstract, but believe me, there is a very linear story.  Even being a Lynch fan (I'll swallow my pride), I myself didn't understand the film very well after my first viewing.  But after figuring it out, you come to realize that this film is a very profoundly beautiful piece.  And very articulate.  Every color, every item, everything has so much meaning to the overlay of the plot.  This is Lynch at his best, so much detail was put in the picture, like every brush had some purpose.  I cannot stress how amazed I am at all the tie-ins and hints that can be told by every little detail.      This isn't one of those films that leaves you hanging either, there is a definate tale that cannot be argued or disputed.  Lynch challenges you to find this message, but that's how he works.  That being said, Mulholland Dr. isn't for everyone.  Whether this is the film for you or not, I'd still recommend at least one viewing, especially since Naomi Watts is so great in it.  I haven't felt so in awe of an actor/actress' performance since I saw Bibi Anderson in Ingmar Bergman's \\"Persona.\\"  Ms. Watts' performance defines good acting.      Mulholland Dr. is basically a simple story of love and revenge.  And while the film is definately not told in a conventional manner, the message is very much so.  The dvd comes with really no extras and no chapter selection, but purposely intented to be packaged like that.  Call it pretentious, but the film is intended to be viewed in whole and Lynch is very closed to explanation as it prevents an open perspective.  If the film does linger an interest for a viewing, my only advise is to be patient and don't get frustrated after one viewing, the film is complicated, but is also very gratifying.      If you aren't really into films that demand complete attention duringthe viewing and analytical thought after the viewing, then this obviously isn't your cup of tea.  If it happens to be your flavor though, I'd recommend watching Robert Altman's \\"3 Woman,\\" Francois Ozon's \\"Swimming Pool,\\" and of course Bergman's \\"Persona\\" in addition to \\"Mulholland Dr.\\"
B00011V8CW|5.0|Love this Album. It sounds great! I'm glad it's back in print. This is a really good come back for Bowie, so I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie was one of the rare sequels that actually proved to be almost better than the first. I think we all needed some new characters and Nightcrawler was great. Iceman and Rogue didn't have much action but they were great anyway.    The plot really is about Wolverine's past and the man who put the adamantium in his body. The movie has a great start with Nightcrawler's attack on the president. Mystique had been posing as Senator Kelly (who we know is dead) was trying to stop the mutant registration act. She later frees Magneto from his plastic cell.     Meanwhile after Wolverine returns to the mansion Professor Xavier tells him he can no longer help him because of his memory loss. Charles also tells Jean and Storm to track Nightcrawler. Soon after they leave the mansion is attacked and Wolverine is the only adult to protect the kids. Most of them escaped though. Wolverine, Iceman, Rogue, and Pyro flee to Bobby's house but they are soon attacked by the police. Jean and Storm shortly come to pick them up but Xavier and Cyclops were captured by Srtyker. The X-men and Magneto join forces to fight Styker together.    I won't reveal anymore of the story because it is great. It is a must see and I highly recommend it.
0312955006|2.0|I read  this book  because so many  people said  what  a  great  surprise  ending  it had.  Are  they  kidding?  I  guessed the  murderer  about halfway through the book, and  was  disappointed when  I  was right.  Not  much of  a challenge.  If  the  incomparable  Ms Christie  had  written  this book,  somebody  REALLY  surprising  -  but  with fair  clues  -  like  the  panhandler,  would  have  turned out  to  be  the murderer.  Believe  me, I'm  not  giving anything away when  I  say this.  Subtlety  isn't this author's  strong  point.  I  expect  his  avid  fans to  put  a ton  of  &quot;Not  Useful&quot;  marks by this  review,  but  the  review  isn't for  them.  It's  for the  reader  who's  looking  for  a good  mystery:  don't  be  snowed by  all the gushing.  An  unsuspenseful story,  predictable  culprit, and  undistinguished  style  -  don't  bother.
B000005HLV|5.0|All i can really tell you about &quot;Mayhem&quot; is that their realy amazing at what they do &amp; they never dissapoint me. I bought this and quickly began to bang my head to each track...I love black metal ! I remenber when i seen mayhen live-they gave an hell of a live performance. All i can really say is ? Buy it now!
B00005O5CM|1.0|Not to mention brazenly manipulative.  Reese Witherspoon is game, and there are several other fine actors that do their best, but the movie manages to be profoundly unfunny, manipulative, and two-faced about its message (the rather trite self-empowerment theme being ultimately at the service of pushing the great goal of traditional marriage-the movie couldn't end without it).  An utterly catastrophic attempt to capture the charm and intelligence of Clueless.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I tought it would be another pertty american chick flick crap, but when i read the reviews here i decided to buy the dvds.<P>I tought it to be amazing, the actors arent the usual pertty boys and gals, and the special effect reminded me of the star wars attack of the clones.<P>I dont really like the cowboy thing but hey has long has there is sci fi its ok.<P>Now i cant wait to get my farscape dvds.
0060977493|4.0|Roy leaves mouths agape; domino structure of language that she forges throughout the work speaks words of volumes to what it means to create. The literary paint thinner to get to the primer of the matter, The God of Small Things is behemoth in execution, rolled to knock the pins from the very structures that we thought, in modernity, cannot possibly exist. Roy opens our eyes to reveal that iniquity exists in the actions of both men and their systems of order and the light that she shows us is nothing less than brilliant.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I enjoy this album for its great, harsh, industrial guitars and rythms.  I would say there are many fanatical reviews here (100000/10??), which I will try to steer from.  As a metal album, Anticrist Superstar is an absolute classic with obviously a lot more than a trent reznor influence (surpasses in many ways, but mainly just different).  In listening, I have noticed three sections or phases this album goes through.  I will rate these different sections.<br />1st-I would rate the opening, Hate Anthem and Beautiful People as near perfect openers, although with some obvious sounding lyrics. They do a great job of setting up the tone and information on the concept of the antichrist superstar as well. 9/10. A lot of people don't like these songs, especially hate anthem. Not me though, I appreciate the unmatched raw energy. Beautiful people is just awesome, although over played.<br />2nd-Next, Dried Up, Tourniquet, Little Horn, Wormboy, Superstar, as well as deformography and cryptorchid really show how great this album is when it hits its stride. These are high energy songs with some great industrial guitars that show off manson's voice.  Especially good are Little Horn, Tourniquet, and Superstar. Great buzz words in all of these. Deformography and cryptorchid are not the best, but all right. Even with them, this section gets 10/10. <br />-Finally, the last half.  I like concept albums as much as the next guy, but this final section just does not do it for me.  Some people actually prefer this section to all others and this can only be a testiment to the many levels this album can be enjoyed on.  I personally feel like these songs were fast songs slowed down, not genuine slow metal songs like \\"scare crow\\" by Ministry.  Maybe manson didn't have the energy for twenty songs with a tempo like the first half.  Its not terrible, however, especially angel with the scabbed wings, and some of the later songs hit some good notes. Also, the lyrics work more closely with his overall album concept (the life and death of the antichrist) here than in any other section. However, these songs just wouldn't stand up by themselves. 6/10<br />Reminder- awesome album. One of the top five metal albums of all time, maybe the best. Seriously.
B00009Z574|1.0|&quot;Tormato&quot; is as much of a musical mess as the album cover. If you've heard it, it's little more than professionally recorded jam-sessions with Jon Anderson attempting to sing over the top. Simply awful and one of the few YES albums to actually be worse than the Trevor Rabin era disasters (especially &quot;Big Generator&quot;). Buy this one only when you have EVERYTHING else by the band to complete your selection if you must (or for a good laugh, kind of like an unintentionally bad movie). But I would even recommend buying all of the YES solo albums before this (also a pretty impossible task if you take a look at all the Rick Wakeman, Patric Moraz, ect solo albums out there, ALL of which I recommend before this fiasco).  One of the few times in recorded history where I would actually suggest deleting this from the bands catalog would actually enhance their reputation. But of course this would mean less money in their pockets, in case you didn't realize. Just wait a few years. They'll probably re-issue it again with still yet other &quot;bonus&quot; tracks to get your cash yet again...Kind of like the Progressive Rock equivilent of an Ed Wood movie...
1577311523|5.0|This is one book that I will always treasure. It has changed my life for the better. Everyone needs to read this book and listen to the audio Cd's. I read the book and than got the audio books. The audio Cd's helped so much. If you only read one book this year,read this book. It is a important book. NOW is all there is and all there will ever be.
0790731452|5.0|My 12yr.year old daughter and I really enjoy Mars Attacks! Its really alot of fun and very funny!hilarious sight gags,the expressions of the martians,the way they say&quot;Mep!Mep!Mep!&quot; just cracks us ups + all the cool cameos throughout the movie are great!The movie is based on the old &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; comic series which I had not been familiar with,but its right up my alley with its cool graphics,which were attacked themselves because of their violence in their time.Its a &quot;must have&quot; for our family collection.Give it a whirl!
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's book \\"On Writing\\" is somewhat a biography and a writers guide all combined in one nice wrapped box.  Just in this case would be considered between two cardboard book covers. Stephen King brings a very interesting but not uncommon among the American Population, in fact, it brings that unprovided light from the unfortunate children to the blue and white collared children. Which to me is a very well thought aspect that should and was considered when writing this book. <BR> His high school career is somewhat interesting, it's not as typical as one may think, Stephen King didn't go out for sports, and instead he went to school and then to work. However, the time frame does set itself for the modern day, he'd get up at 5am and wouldn't get home till 12am. Now, he would do the common homework in school stuff, but when he describes it, he describes it in such a way that you feel like your there, right where he is at the moment. When he discusses college, you can almost sense that he was not serious about it and he wasn't, like most Americans, like myself do give a serious sense about post high school. I believe Stephen King did an excellent job researching that aspect and unitized it so it would give the correct vibes. <BR> Now after his childhood and high school career and his college days, there is only one thing to do, and that is not to party. But in fact to settle down, Stephen King did that by actually checking out a young lady in a yellow turtleneck with a black skirt and nice panty hose. The word choice he uses shows the love that he has between his wife and himself in their relationship and now marriage is unconditional.  He also mentions that starting a family is never an easy task, because of the factors surrounding work, money and stuff, just not enough time to make and rise kids. In today's hustling and bustling society that is very true, because as a society we have grown, shall we say? <BR> He touches base on the fact that only 5 percent of writers in America only make enough to support themselves and a family, nicely. He does show fabulous proof that indeed you have to, because his first deal was only for 50 bucks, not much, but he didn't have a family then, so it wasn't bad. But then when the seventies hit and when playboy Magazine came a knocking for Stephen King to write for them, he would and the best offer he got was for $28,000 buckaroos, and of course he took it. The best deal he had ever gotten in the beginning of the times was the book he wrote, the publishing company wanted to pay him $400,000 thousand dollars to publish it, and such, and mind you, it still was the seventies. He also says when you go and write you must be committed when you are trying to make it big, it's not something for someone to go do for one day and expect to be golden. Not by a long shot and not only does that rule apply to that, but it applies to many aspects of something we call, life. To even make this so-called boring part of the book, he uses attention grabbers and such to keep the parts moving and to me, it's a good thing. <BR> He speaks of a subject that a young guy like myself dreams about, but for many, it's a reality. Retirement and a house without the little ones, which to me, although I'm 17, it's a good thing to think about...but to some I would be jumping the gun a bit and I can understand, we all have different opinions on different subjects. By what Stephen King is talking about, it almost sounds like you need to plan for the retirement of you and your partner in crime, as soon as you leave college, which is scary. But in closing, The book, for the price that I paid was not as bad as it sounded, because if you believe the phrase\\" Judge a Book by it's cover\\" then you may not want to read this. The fact, the cover serves as a liberally sounded cover and some people don't like that. But to me you are fools, because the book is and could be considered another masterpiece by Stephen King.
B00008977N|2.0|i was counting the days,waiting for this dvd to come and now that i have finally got it,i am very disappointed!i hate being negative like this but i really didnt like what i heard and saw.first of all the video/audio is out of synch.its not a big deal(someone would say)but the whole time i had the feeling im watching via satellite.but what really bothered me was the remix,and the fact that i did not hear many things i was expecting to hear. entire passages that are on the cd were missing(example:drum solos on &quot;shaking the tree&quot;).and i really do not understand why this has been done.i have listened to the cd 1000 times,and i know every small detail.further more i consider it one of the most beautiful pieces of so called pop music recorded and i think things should  have been left just the way they were.for me as a result of this remix some great pieces of music have been lost on the dvd.i was really disappointed to see all this damage done to such a masterpiece.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Its great to see Gavin getting more and more exposure each week- That the album hit number one on Amazon and 6 on Billboard after his appearance on One Tree Hill proves his marketability and certainly his talent- Why he is not all over the radio, VH1 and MTV like Jason Mraz and John Mayer is a mystery but perhaps better as his credibility is being earned by his live performances- get the album and see him live!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Somehow, I'm not on the committee, at least for the former. Rufus' lyrics are definitely right up there with those of any lyric poet / Nobel Prize winner of the past quarter century. No question. <BR>And, no more complaints re Rufus' voice, please; it only goes to show the complainant's lack of ear and comprehension, i.e., the complainant being the one who is whining. Be quiet and listen. Carefully. Because it may require attention on more layers, at greater depths that you are used to. And, therefore be all the more satisfying.<BR>We recently saw him at the Beacon in New York. Perfect venue for him! He did a two-hour set and that was after the two opening acts. Tight, tight performance. A consummate entertainer. The bearable human side of a perfectionist, for which we, the audience benefited greatly. Charming to the Nth. He only wanted to please us. You could eat him with a spoon. <BR>Rufus simply could not have existed at any moment in time before now. How lucky for us. Right now. <br />Rufus, we simply adore you. And everybody else in your family that has lent you all those enriched genes, all that heritage, for you to do all this with. <BR>When, Rufus, when, tell me when can I have Want Two?
B00005JN08|4.0|Wow, that Robert Evans dude needs to take an English course. Sorry, I just had to start off with that.<br />Well, due to unfortunate circumstances, my friends and I ended up watching Eurotrip, but that ain't a bad thing.<br />I liked the movie. I will admit that I don't think it was the best movie in the world and that the humor kind of dies down for a few moments in the middle, but who really cares? I still liked it. I definitely liked this movie better than Old School and Road Trip. I don't know if that helps anyone make a judgement to see it, but you should.<br />I know that some people will get offended at some of the content in the movie. There is this one moment involving a Hitler impersonator, but I'm sorry, it was funny. It was actually one of the funnier moments of the film. The other could be offending part in the movie, I didn't really find funny, but still, I didn't have a problem with it.<br />I know that this movie isn't doing the best at the box office, but I think that more people should give it a chance. It is made up of the same things that made American Pie, Old School, and Road Trip hits. Fortunately, this movie is really also rather clever dealing with stereotypes, which shouldn't be a big problem because everyone should be able to point out what a sterotype is (see 50 First Dates for reference). The movie is funny and not as stupid as one might think. Go check it out.
0312979479|5.0|Greatest mystery book ever written.  I read this in my basement in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm (how cliche) and this book scared the hell out of me.  The plot is amazing.  Buy this book...now!
6305291446|1.0|What was that guy in the commercial for this film thinking when he said &quot;Finally a sequel, that lives up to the origanal&quot;. Dude, Michael Myers is a COMPLETE Jason rip off. Everything you saw Jason do Michael Myers did in this. Michael is no longer a stange creater that is a part of the shadows like he was in the first film. Even if your a Jason fan you'll hate this movie. The next one is much better. Okay, the so called story is Larie( Jamie Lee Curts) FAKED her death in a car crash that was in Halloween 4. She then moved to Californea. But Michael Myers gets a profile and goes to Californea in one day! O yeah, if you want to see this film because Jamie Lee Curtis is in it, let warn you that her charator is COMPLTELY diffrent then her charactor in Halloween 1-2. Anyway, after about an hour of nothing happing, michael Finally kills someone. From that point on they steal most of the seancens frome the fourth film. Jmaie Lee Curtis's fight with Michael was really dull. But the worst part was after the fight, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers hold hands and cry togther!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT!!! Skip this film.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|If there is any word that would describe this album is Balance. It has the perfect guitar and vocal melodies. Shadows can tear you apart with his voice, just like roaring thunder, or he can lift you up like an angel. What's so wrong about that? Actually there are lots of guys that act so tough that they got to have it like Lamb of God gives it away. Don't get me wrong, I love Lamb of God, but I would like them to find the perfect balance between Heaven and Hell like Avenged Sevenfold do in this album. If you're too macho don't listen to this album. If you are secure of who you are and you like Lamb of God, Shai Hulud, The Crown, Iron Maiden, you are going to love this album. It has the right touch. Guys, (I'm talking to the band right now), you have the coolest chemistry, don't change it... I love your guitar riffs, your changes in the melodies and beats... Keep it up... it is only but a Masterpiece!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a shining example of how simplicity (so rare these days I may add) is always a huge success. This is a movie for every age. It is however, so much more fun watching with young kids - watching their spontaneous and uninhibited responses. No matter what the age of the audience, it is bound to rivet you to your seat. Few other movies are a match for this movie - I have to go back all the way to The Jungle Book (original) to find a match! Well made and highly recommended for anyone's movie collection. I watched the movie in the first week and bought the DVD the first day. The animation is exemplary. Well done Disney and Pixar!
0060931736|3.0|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is about a young unorthodox teacher and her special but ultimately different relationship with six of her students.  The story is set in Edinburgh around the 1930's.  It mostly takes place in the school where Miss Jean Brodie is a teacher but in the least sence of the meaning.<br />Miss Jean Brodie is a woman in her prime and has been many places that follow with dramatic stories.  She lives her life through six girls.  The girls are know to everyone as \\"The Brodie Set.\\"  Miss Jean Brodie picked the six girls and they soon became her favorites.<br />Even though Miss Jean Brodie lives her life through the girls she taught them to grow up to be and do what they believe.  She teaches them about art, love, and how to be a proper woman.  She tends to demonstrate it as well.  Miss Jean Brodie is ultimately a unique woman.  She encourages the girls to become sexually active and tells them stories of the love of her life.  Miss Jean Brodie would have them over for tea, accompany them for walks, and take them to plays.<br />The head mistress of the school despises Miss Jean Brodie and is willing to do anything to get rid of her but she needs a reason.  The book goes through the lives of the girls from when they were young and in their prime until they are older and no longer associate with Miss Jean Brodie.  The turning point of the story is that Miss Jean Brodie gets fired because of one of her precious girls.<br />Overall the book was slightly boring but still satisfying.  The book reflects betrayl, fitting in, relationships, rebellions, and love.  I would recommend this book to others.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|If ever a re release of great albums was long overdue, this is one of them. Fortunately for me I had heard it was coming out and was able to pawn off my copies of the original pressing CD's for a nice amount of cash(helped me put new windows on my house too). Anyway, the 6 albums included here contain some of the greatest music ever recorded by one of the world's greatest song writers. The music on this set is amazing. George Harrison is my favorite Beatle and has given me years and years of listening pleasure. The only downfall of this set is the minimal amount of bonus tracks. Of the four deleted tracks from \\"Somewhere In England\\", only \\"Tears Of The World\\" made it but is included as part of \\"33 1/3\\". Why would they do this? The remaining tracks, \\"Sat Singing\\", the original 1980 mix of \\"Lay His Head\\" and my all time favorite song \\"Flying Hour\\" are nowhere to be found. I have been hearing that they are being saved for an upcoming George Harrison Anthology. If this is the case, I just hope the Harrison family and Capitol Records are aware that the version of \\"Flying Hour\\" slated for the original \\"Somewhere In England\\" album is superior to the one that was released as part of the 'Songs By George Harrison' book. I will assume that \\"Cheer Down\\", \\"Poor Little Girl\\", \\"Cockamamie Business\\", all originally a part of \\"The Best Of Dark Horse\\" in 1989, will also see a re release as well. The bonus tracks included here are rather fascinating in themselves. I enjoy the demo of \\"Save The World\\" more so than the actual recording which I find to be rather goonie. \\"Mystical One (Demo)\\" is very dreary and I am glad to see that Harrison knew to spunk it up. \\"Here Comes The Moon (Demo)\\" is nice and almost identical to the arrangement George decided on. \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" & \\"Zig Zag\\" have been around for sometime. \\"ZZ\\" as the flip side of \\"When We Was Fab\\" and \\"SS\\" from that piece of garbage film of the same name and various bootlegs. As for \\"Live In Japan\\", no bonus tracks were included. Once again I hope the powers that be are aware of the two tracks not included on the original release- \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" & \\"Fish On The Sand\\". Let's hope they intend on utilizing them for the proposed anthology. The DVD is VERY nice but just like the CD's, has it's \\"holes\\". It includes both versions of the \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" videos but excludes \\"True Love\\", \\"Blow Away\\" & \\"All Those Years Ago\\". May I assume again and hope for a DVD with the anthology which includes these videos and more? So my message to Dhani, Olivia and Capitol Records: For the anthology, please use the superior sped up version of \\"Flying Hour\\" which was intended for the original release of \\"Somewhere In England\\".

0553579908|5.0|I started this series two months ago and I burned through the first three. I'm now waiting anxiously for the fourth, but there is almost a four year gap between 3 and 4. It is going to be extremely difficult to wait 8 years for the final installment if Martin keeps to that schedule. <br />However, that aside, this was my first foray into fantasy novels after many disillusioned years away. I'm hooked again. There are very few books or authors that could keep me enthralled through 2100 pages, but Martin has done it. He's renewed my faith in Fantasy and proved that it can be much more than formulaic drivel.
B000065U1N|4.0|The battle this film presents technically superbly, confronts two worlds, two very different ways to see life and two different motivations to fight. We see: USA soldiers are well trained and armed professionals.<BR> But the Somali chief, in smoking his Havana cigar, predicts that was to follow: he smokes with delectation as those who know they don't attain to live largely and he speaks right: in Somalia they have yet killed about 300000 of his own people, and health or life have almost any worth in Mogadiscio. Killing and terror is simply his consuetudinary way of living his short life, and being light weapons cheaper in international black markets than food or medicines, the Delta Force and Rangers have to confront with an enemy formed by a chaotic crowd poor or nothing trained but which knows well the ground, fully armed, and over all, desperate and possessed by a dement aggressiveness. Sure there are the helicopters Blackhawks and the Hummers, but after all these are only a few light American vehicles and a few American men. The battle begins and a patrolling action theoretically of only some minutes of duration ends into a furious battle of many hours with several hundred Somalis and nineteen Americans killed. This movie aims almost exclusively in the objective action and owing to the realism in showing the efficacy of weapons of today, even the lighter, the film I think acquires a quality of coldness and despersonalization  that can or cannot taste to each viewer, but I think that is something deliberately chosen, and surely more near to the feelings of the real fighters than seen in older war films as war isn't a garden party. You must decide if you like films as this, but for me it's very good.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|For a long time there were people out there, myself included who suspected that West Wing scribe Aaron Sorkin may have been moonlighting over on Gilmore Girls.  His trademarked fast-speak, witty observations and fascinating characters are apparent on both shows.  We were wrong though.  <br />Both shows have amazing ensemble casts and writing that defies description.  With Angel going away after this season I am left with only three shows to Tivo each week.  Gilmore Girls, West Wing and The Shield.  It's hard to lament that fact though when looking at the quality of what remains behind.<br />My wife and I want to find this quaint, little, New England township and move there.  The characters on the periphery of the show are positively Rockwellian, yet quirky, intelligent and interesting.  Don't even get me started on the Gilmores themselves.  These are the kinds of people wifey and I love to hang around with; incredibly well read, almost painfully intelligent, yet whimsical, fun loving and sometimes just plain silly.  We love visiting with them every Tuesday night and can't wait to catch up on some good old times once this DVD boxed set comes in.
B0000399WI|5.0|As many others have indicated, this is truly one of the outstanding movies of all time.  It will ultimately join the pantheon of phenomenal movies that were not great successes at the time of their release.  No matter; there are many people that I know (myself and my wife included) who rate this as their all-time favorite movie.  We have watched it at least 25 times; it is constantly on television and whenever it is on, we inevitably watch it to its astounding conclusion.  As others have said, the ending can be watched repeatedly, ad infinitum, and not lose any lustre.  The cinematography, dialogue, acting, tempo, narration by Morgan Freeman, etc are peerless.  This movie incorporates may of life's lessons; indeed, it is a metaphor for life.  Hope is a good thing; maybe the best of things.  If Andy can survive his ordeal, we can conquer our own personal challenges as well.
0783225792|4.0|In many ways, Casino is the epic Goodfellas could not be.  Casino is about relationships between characters in and around organized crime and gambling, and it's about the arc that an entire city of pleasure takes over these people.<br />It's Scorsese and Pileggi and DeNiro and Pesci and Frank Vincent again and it's a top-notch, gorgeous gangster epic.<br />In the early 70s the Chicago Outfit sends Sam 'Ace' Rothstein out to Las Vegas to manage the casinos they're skimming cash from.  Ace is a gambling master, a sure-bettor who never loses; soon the Tangiers is raking in more dough than ever due to his management.  In order to better 'manage', the Outfit also sends Nicky Santoro, a crafty but hot-headed soldiers (Pesci) to Vegas, to provide the muscle.  Pretty soon Pesci is smacking people around, stabbing them with pens, putting their heads in vices, and even vandalizing their cars (not to mention flat-out threatening to crack their heads open) all as he looks to set up his own empire away from the Dons in the Midwest.<br />When Ace marries a call girl named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and attempts to start a family, things start going downhill.  Ginger is still involved with her old pimp, for one.  And let me pause to mention that James Woods has played possibly the sleaziest, most disgusting rat pimp of all time, from the subtleties like his mustache and mesh shirt to his cheap talk and bullying threats.  Eventually, Ace, Nicky, Ginger, Nicky's Vegas crew, they all manage to bring the house crashing down on them.<br />This is all based on the true story of the Chicago Mob in Las Vegas and the hold the families had on the big casinos.  Pillegi's source book is an interesting account for sure, with more commentary from some minor characters in the film, giving it different angles than just the Deniro-Stone-Pesci trifecta.<br />The film looks gorgeous, it has to be one of Scorsese's biggest budgets.  The 70s clothes, the cars, the settings--they manage to scrounge up enough un-touched 70s Vegas left, and they film in real casinos quite a bit.<br />The film is three hours long; there's a lot packed into this.  Along the way it can be fun; the voiceover sequences of Ace describing the workings of a casino, or how people cheat (and get caught) playing blackjack, or the montage of Nicky's gangster antics, all make this very engaging.  The film is a lot bloodier than Goodfellas, and even had to be cut (during the infamous head-vice scene.)<br />This can't be recommended highly enough, HOWEVER, once again we have a very lame DVD, not as bad as Goodfellas, but not much better.  You don't have to flip this one over, but for a three hour film, there are far too FEW chapters, making it very frustrating if you want to watch certain portions again.  There's a trailer, wow!  There's also some text you can read on the production and the stars, but quite frankly, that is one of the lamest features they try to put on discs.  Can't they simply print production notes in a booklet?<br />If you haven't seen this or Goodfellas, come out of the cave.  If you listen to some people who say 'It's like Goodfellas, but not as good', well, you can let them think for you.  It's as good as Goodfellas, and arguably better.<br />And Joe Pesci has some of the most choice swearing lines...up enough un-touched 70s Vegas left, and they film in real casinos quite a bit.  <br />The film is three hours long; there's a lot packed into this.

0790729725|4.0|The film is really five stars, but the absolutely shoddy DVD has to take away.<br />Goodfellas is rightly considered one of Scorsese's masterpieces, a moment where a great filmmaker got everything right.  It's based on the Nicholas Pileggi true crime book about Henry Hill, a low-level hood in the Lucchese crime family in the 60s and 70s.  Tracing his rise from fetcher for local mafiosi in his  50s Brooklyn neighborhood, the film tracks Henry to the end of the line: the Federal Witness Protection program.  Along the way Scorsese stages some great scenes, charting the dangerous, thrilling, and ultimately miserable life of a mob hustler.  Ray Liotta has a perfect sleaza factor working as Hill.  However, he is almost too nice to be convincing as the same guy in the source book.  The real Henry Hill comes off as a real lowlife in the book, a guy who deserves no sympathy.  Ironically, years after leaving the program Hill now runs a website, writes wiseguy-related books, and calls into Howard Stern, though he's still watching his back.<br />The cast is Classic Mafia Cast.  Robert DeNiro plays the greedy and devious Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway, Joe Pesci plays Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning role(!) that basically defined the Pesci persona for life, and Paul Sorvino plays a portly Mob captain who has an amazing scene where he emotes while frying up some tasty sausages, tears in his eyes, handing Henry a massive wad of cash.<br />The film can't be recommended enough.  It was robbed at Oscar time, criminally losing to Dances With Wolves, but it doesn't matter.  This has sealed itself as one of the ultimate guy films of all time.<br />Unfortunately, the DVD is absolutely appalling.  You actual have to flip the disc over in the middle of the film to finish it.  This is simply unacceptable.  I haven't seen another like it, I mean, why bother with the DVD format?  The film looks and sound just fine, it's great, but how about some extras?  This film was highly praised and will hold up for a long time, so how about something?<br />Not sure if Scorsese can be bothered or has not been asked to do special edition discs of more of his films.  The Taxi Driver DVD is very nice, for instance.  Goodfellas has a trailer, whoopee, and again, it's two-sided.  Lame.<br />Buy if you've never seen this, else if you have a widescreen VHS this DVD won't offer you a whole lot.up for a long time, so how about something?  <br />Not sure if Scorsese can be bothered or has not been asked to do special edition discs of more of his films.

0385504209|5.0|I have never written a book review before but I am STUNNED by the one star reviews given by historical experts who expected that a work of FICTION would contain only FACTS about Leonardo Da Vinci.  Are these people serious?  I totally agree with another five star reviewer who basically stated that if one wants to read a historical account of an event, read a history book!  This is a fictional book with enough fact thrown in to keep it interesting!<br />I would highly recommend this book, though it is a tad predictable at times.  It is a highly entertaining and fun read.
B00005AQF7|4.0|I think it's safe to say, this isn't just &quot;Snoop Dogg's&quot; best album, but it's one of the all-time rap greats. Who doesn't recognize this as an absolute classic? Even people who normally don't dig rap can't help but like it. This was produced by &quot;Dr. Dre&quot;, and was released soon after his own &quot;Chronic&quot; album. &quot;Doggystyle&quot; is almost like &quot;Chronic part 2&quot; in a way. This of course had the huge hits &quot;Gin And Juice&quot; and &quot;Who Am I? (What's My Name)&quot;, but I like &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Fun (if my homies can't have none)&quot; just as much. I often think of this album as part of the G-Funk trilogy, with &quot;Chronic&quot; and Warren G's &quot;Regulate...G Funk Era&quot; being the other two.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|I had this album in cassette back in the day, but I waited for the remastered disc to finally upgrade, and it is worth it! This is a great Harrison record from start to finish (at least, the original finish, not the two tacked-on jams, I don't really like those.) But I still give it 5 stars. My favorite track is &quot;This Is Love,&quot; such an underrated gem from George. Other highlights are &quot;Cloud 9,&quot; &quot;That's What It Takes,&quot; &quot;Devil's Radio,&quot; and what the heck, the entire disc!!! They are all highlights!!! Get this now!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just got word that the firefly movie has been greenlighted!! This is shiny news to all the fans. If you have not picked up this dvd set, you definatly should. Think about it, why would universal greenlight a movie based on a cancelled tv show? Because the series was the best tv series ever. I had never seen Firefly and I just bought the set based on what people said. I am not sorry, I have now become a devoted fan and I urge you to do the same. just give it a chance. You will not regret it. To all the fans: We did it!! shiny!! thank you, Joss!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Although a nice looking film this isn't even Bill Murray's best film to date. There are couple decent scenes, but it moves along very slowly at times. You have one character going though a midlife crisis and another with maybe a little neglectful husband. Both characters just seem to be bored with their lives and the only thing that makes this movie half interesting is they are in a different setting being in Japan. Sofia Coppola deserves some credit for shooting this in less than a month and writng the screenplay for a young director, but those things shouldn't come into play when juding how good a film really is. Scarlett Johansson looks good on screen and has a nice presence, but that could be just all those underwear shots they had in the movie. Just becasue a film is set in modern day Japan, \\"oh its so quirky and strange\\" doesn't make a great movie. There are better movies out there set in modern day Japan that never received this much critical acclaim one being Kikujiro. Some seem to have been Lost in the Hype on this one. No commentaries from Bill Murray, Sofia Coppola or Scarlett Johannson is also a negative in terms of the DVD.
0156027321|5.0|This is an extremely extraordinary book. The story centers around our main character, Pi Patel; he is the son of a zookeeper in India who's actual name in full was Piscine Molitor, named after a swimming pool that a family friend went to regularly. But children at school began calling him Pissing,  so he shortened it to Pi. Pi was pretty uncomfortable in school, as so many kids are. Up his alley more was home life. It's interesting to note how he observes certain behavioral \\"instincts\\" from the animals at the zoo. The same schedule and habits they are accustomed acted out day in and day out. If someone happens to come along and change their routine even a tiny bit, uncertainty for them sets in. They may even begin drawing away from the world.<br />I won't give away the whole story for you. But, Pi's mom and dad are both completely non religious; whereas to Pi, these religious aspects of life are fascinating. Pi considers himself Hindu, yet also finds himself attracted to Christianity and Islam, as well. So by chance he meets up with a Catholic priest and later comes to get baptized. He also has talks with a Muslim Sufi in the market, and soon gets a prayer rug and begins praying as fervently as any devout Muslim would 5 days a week. The religious leaders in Pi's area didn't like this at all. They wanted to force him into choosing one religion over the other. But Pi was not about to give up his interreligious activities. He was simply showing and expressing his love for God in any way he could do so.<br />This book gets very intersting from here, where Pi even has an \\"enlightenment\\" experience down the road. To sum up, \\"Life of Pi\\" is a layered searching out of the Unknown that illuminates all our lives. This should absolutely be on everyone's bookshelf. Enjoy it.
0783225792|5.0|Do you enjoy good movies? If yes, then you must rent/buy this movie. If not, then go back to sleeping in the ditch behind the shed. DeNiro and Pesci work extremely well togather, and its shown with movies like good fellas, raging bull, and casino. I can't reccomend this movie enough, it's THAT good. It's long, about 3hrs but its well worth it. This movie grabs your attention by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits. Excellent story/actors make this a must see movie. <br />***Silent B******
B000002HD5|4.0|At first listen this disc can be a little rough, but after that it's near perfect. I can't really compare them to anyone, which I guess means that they're doing their own thing, and rock like no one else. I really like Greg Dulli's delivery, and as a whole the band is tight. The &quot;hit&quot; from this I believe was &quot;Debonair&quot;, and is an excellent song, hand-claps and all. Then &quot;When We Two Parted&quot; is much slower and seductive, and &quot;I Keep Coming Back&quot; is almost hypnotic. I've been impressed with this album for a decade now, yet I can only really describe it as cool. Some of their other stuff is great too, but I suspect this is their best release.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This essential Harrison release from the 70's is a must have. I haven't heard this album before, but I bought it, along with all of the other re-released discs. I like this album. The songs dedicated to his wife are top-notch, along with the leadoff track. &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is an acoustic version, I prefer the Beatles version, but the acoustic version is mellower. I recommend this one.
0385504209|2.0|OK ok - I did read the book and I thought it stunk. Poorly written drivel for the masses. Akin to romance novels. A book with nothing to offer to anyone but viewers of reality TV.<br />And to people like John Sebastian. You really need to learn to direct you anger towards something positive and stop bashing other reviewers. Hypocrites abound @ Amazon.com!
B000002HHB|5.0|Natalie Merchant perfectly portrays the emotional statements made by the beautifully written lyrics.  This album reflects her emotional outlook on life, which is an introverted one.  The band supports her singing to a chilling degree.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves music to be subtle, poetic, mysterious and reflective.  It's also a great date album, married or single!
0780628551|2.0|Astronaut's Wife tries hard but it's just too silly to be taken seriously. Johnny Depp is fine as Spencer an astronaut who may be possessed by an alien but he's stuck with Charlize Theron. Although she gotten much better as an actress and went on to win an Oscar this year in this role she's ghastly. She was evidently directed to do an imitation of Mia Farrow ala Rosemary's Baby and falls flat partly becuase she's got to work with dumb lines from a poor script.  <br />Having said all that the movie is entertaining if you enjoy throwing popcorn at your TV and yelling insults at the actors.

B000002U6E|4.0|Even though to the new fan I'd recommend the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, this is still a great disc for anyone. It does include &quot;Return To Innocence&quot;, which may be their biggest hit ever, and though the rest isn't as catchy, it's very good. &quot;Out From The Deep&quot; is another stand-out, and &quot;Age Of Loneliness&quot; and &quot;Eyes Of Truth&quot; are both wonderful as well. This does remind me a bit of &quot;Deep Forest&quot;, and of some things from &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; too. It's a great mix of new age, pop, and world music.
B00011RPB0|4.0|First off, Lost in Translation is obviously not for everyone. Some people may not be able to connect with the movie due to the way it tries to convey its messages, and it does it in a way that most people (besides movie reviewers and actors) cannot recognize. Truly, because of my profession (I work in a video store), I have to listen to people come back and complain about how much they hated this movie. The reasons for dislike range from boredom to religious reasons (the two main characters are married, and during one scene they lie on the same bed, but nothing happens!) In my opinion, one should never judge a movie that is trying to be realistic due to religious reasons. The reason I actually docked this movie by one star is simply due to the fact that it really is not for everyone, and it can be somewhat irritating how slow it moves. However, this movie is absolutely great if you like slow, realistic movies.<br />I found that there are three basic elements to the theme/message of the story, this is just my take on it, so it differs with what a lot of people may say about it.<br />1) There is the setting. Our two main characters (Murray and Johansson) are two Americans that seem to be isolated in a foreign land, namely Japan. This is one element that I think a lot of people can connect to, especially if the person watching has been to foreign countries. There is the language barrier, and Murray finds himself being given surprising short translations from long, Japanese instructions. One has to wonder what was really said (hence the title), and this really adds to the feeling of isolation. <br />2)There is the fact that these two Americans actually meet and become very good friends due to similar circumstances in their lives. Anyone knows that having a good friend is important, but it becomes even more so when they are isolated in a foreign country. So Murray and Johannsen connect big time. Yet there are other factors that come into play here, a romantic involvementthat can never be (as far as we know) because both are married. This presents a huge barrier that ends up being the third element of the movie.<br />3) Murray finds that he has really deep feelings for Johansson, and at the end of the movie you can see that Murray really needs to let these feelings become known, and he does it with a final act (I am not going to spoil it, but I think you can guess). Anyway, the end is the culmination of how Murray finds himself through feeling he has and expresses for Johansson. <br />Overall, the movie is not that exciting. If you want flaring guns and growling beasts, watch Underworld. This movie has a lot of subtle humor and it can convey quite a bit of meaning. However, if you do not really want to be thinking about the movie, and just want to be entertained, this movie is not really for you. I found it enjoyable but do not recommend it after a hard, stressful day of work.
B000005JA8|1.0|An unbelievably stupid album - stupid to the point of fatuousness.  All of the pretense of extreme detail and complication only serve to show how little is really here.  This is nothing - not music, not art, not interesting, not novel, and most of all not important.  A total waste of time and energy.
0060005688|5.0|Dr. Schwartz has exposed the difference between the best and good enough.  He tells us that &quot;maximizers&quot; are people who want the absolute best, so they have to examine every choice or they fear they are not getting the best.

A &quot;satisficer&quot; is a person who looks at the options and chooses an option that is good enough. <BR>  Maximizers may look at satisficers and say, &quot;they're lazy or they're compromisers&quot;, but Dr. Schwartz points out that satisficers can have high standards.

The maximizer is more externally motivated because they are not looking at themselves, they're looking at others to see if what they have is better. Dr. Schwartz points out that social comparison brings unhappiness.
0385504209|1.0|Huge bestseller, interesting subject matter, a quick read, yet still a tremendous waste of time. I'm not troubled with the inaccuracies in the book, it is fiction after all... What troubles me is how poorly written the book is. The author lacks any hint of gift with the written word. The writing has an irritating, smug tone and exceptionally grating tongue-in-cheek dialogue. This author's prose is reminiscent of, and has all the sophistication of the narration from Ed Wood's movies.<br />Any real mystery or intrigue in the book is coincidental, inherent in the subject matter but missing from the story. The author wraps an absurd plot in sophomoric characters and childish puzzles. The characters repeatedly struggle with riddles that would make Encyclopedia Brown chortle, and that every reader has easily solved.<br />The DaVinci Code is like a children's book distillation of Umberto Eco's work... A poor man's Foucault's Pendulum or Baudolino.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Doing good for goodness sakes.  Sister prejean exemplifies the teachings of Jesus and of how Christians should live their lives by.  This movie doesn't preach, nor does it necessarily feed you a messege.  Every side is seen, and we also sympathize with each side.  We grieve the loss of a son and a daughter of the victim, and we can't help but feel saddened by the fate of Matthew Poncelete.  <br />It's an odd feeling to sympathize with a man who, without a doubt, is deserving of the punishment he's about to recieve.  But this movie doesn't get stuck with captial punishment issue.  It certainly opens up the dialogue for people for and against death penalty, but it doesn't swing its influence one way or the other.  We already realize his death is coming, and instead of forcing the tear out of us by making the movie the 'Hollywood' way (last minute pardon, miracles saves Matthew's life, ect.), it instead takes a spiritual path.<br />The movie is about salvation and redemption of a sinner, and gives hope that no one is too far gone for forgiveness.  All this, without an ounce of feeling like a Christian movie.  Simply powerful.
B000002LQR|1.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers were another main factor in the commercialization of alternative rock along with Nirvana and Jane's Addiction.  Their lyrical content wasn't much different than the sex obsessed lyrics in the glam metal of the late '80's, which helped the public make a smooth transition from one fad to the next.<BR>The RCHP album before \\"Blood sugar sex magic\\" wasn't bad, but this album was such a blatant attempt to market their sound to the brain dead masses.  ...<BR>Like all other pop music, it's fun the first few times and then it gets annoying.  Anthony Kiedis' rap style vocals are very cheesy.  He sounds way too white to be rapping which makes it really awkward and unnatural.<BR>Kiedis' soft voice is very annoying as heard on \\"Under the Bridge\\"...<BR>The lyrics are pretty bad also.  It's the typical left wing agenda won them critical praise.  The party and have sex themes are for very shallow people.  The sensitive '90's man lyrics are just disgusting.<BR>Musically, the album is so polished it takes away from the emotional impact.  When a band uses high dollar production, it usually means the music cannot stand on it's own.  <BR>The funky bass and beat makes it sound more like soul music than rock.  The bass pretty much dominates the overall sound.  The guitar sound is mostly in the vein of classic rock and clashes with the funk in a bad way.<BR>The worst thing about this album is the inside of the CD where the band members are posing to show off their tattoos.  Their imagery was just like glam metal, only showing off tattoos instead of hairstyles.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I find it interesting to find that 709 people have reviewed this film. That says something about the film. Whether you like the film or not it has generated a lot of comment.<br />I saw the film without knowing a thing about it other than Bill Murray was in it and another Coppola was involved. If you have read the reviews you know that Bill Murray is lost in Tokyo and connects with a much younger woman. At first I thought this was going to be another younger person - older person romance but it is not. It is about two people in a foriegn land finding a common need in each other. And thats about it. Nothing much happens other than a romp through Tokyo. But I watched it knowing I would be watching it again and if you are purchasing a DVD that is important. To me, anyway. <br />I found the ending to be very satisfying, leaving me wondering how a woman as young a Sophia Coppola could get inside the head of a 50 year old male. In the hands of most it would have been a straight romance. I am interested to see where she is going next.
B00006BNDI|5.0|from the confines of the insane's mind, feelings of misanthropy and hostility towards mankind spew forth in all their blunt... honesty.<br />we all 'see' images and visions in our head and we all have experienced how frustrating it is, not to be able to transfer them faithfully onto canvas or tape, most of the times.<br />the greatness of this album lies in its power to conjure BACK into the mind of the listener, that primal feeling of rejection of  modern society and all the bounds it has put on Man. the music, slow paced, repetitive and hypnotic, evokes images embedded in our collective unconcious, of times forgotten, when Man was free from all conceivable bounds. What once was...<br />Hvis lyset tar oss, is a shriek of horror at what we have become, because maybe, it's too late now that we try to be free again.<br />This music succeeds in reversing the roles, by suppressing the conscious mind and awakening the unconscious, resulting in a nearly undescribable experience of having travelled to and returned from some very distant level of existence.<br />The mind wakes up again, numb, at the sound of a sad, dirgy keyboard instrumental, bringing the voyage to its closure.
B0001AP12G|4.0|The production on this album is tight, but lyrically soft in some spots. The subject matters, from materialism to God, is an interesting mix. Highlights are: All Falls Down which features a tight hook from Lauryn Hill and some nice gems about materialism; Spaceship which is a knockin' song about escapism; Jesus Walks which gives a shout out to the Son of Man, but not as deep as some might say; Never Let Me Down is HOT featuring Jigga and K West comes tight too; Get Em High is also a highlight feat. Kweli and Common, it is tight from top to bottom; Slow Jamz is aight; Two Words is also nice even though it features Freeway. This is long winded, but definitely cop the album. It may not be revolutionary, but it is highly bumpable, even with all the silly a$s skits.
B0000019HU|5.0|Wow. I can't emphazise enough how good Slint's Spiderland actually is. I know that sounds like overblown fanboy gushing, and it probably is, but hear me out. Released in 1992, Spiderland was forgotten amidst the waves of Seattle grunge, and that's too bad, for this is an incredibly unique work.<br /><br />This Louisville, Kentucky quartet was once a hardcore punk outfit, though you would never realize it by listening to this album. The guitars are spidery, the tempos slow and methodical, and the vocalist recites muted spoken word in the darkened recesses. The arrangements are somewhat spare and repetitious on first listen, yet there is an underlying mathematical structure to them--the buildups are truly staggering in their power. Overall, the sound is distant, dark, and vaguely unsettling. This album conveys the sound of an overcast and windy autumn night, the leaves rustling in the trees, the fog rolling in. Delicate and meloncholy, yet shadowy and intense at the same time.<br /><br />Spiderland rewards a patient listener. The songs are extended somewhat, hovering in between five to almost nine minutes. The chiming guitars of the opener Breadcrumb Trail begin the journey, followed by the wonderfully creepy Nosferatu Man, probably the most aggressive track on the album. Don, Aman is a moody piece full of whispered lyrics and strummed guitars that ominously build and build, until a wave of distortion breaks through as if to signify something dramatic and terrible has happened. Washer, the longest track, is a downbeat and poignant song full of yearning and emotionally naked lyrics. This is not \\"emo\\"--this is way more powerful and moving than any whinery that the likes of Conor Oberst can muster up. \\"Wash yourself in your tears, and build your church on the strength of your faith..\\"<br /><br />For Dinner.. is an instrumental. While it is not the strongest track on the album, it serves as a breather for the finale Good Morning, Captain, one of the most emotionally intense pieces of music I've ever heard. The way the singer whispers toward the end, \\"I'm trying to find my way home..I'm sorry, and I miss you,\\" followed by a dramatic crescendo and his cries of \\"I miss you!\\"--it leaves a pit in my stomach. Every time. Sounds cliche, I know, but it must be heard to be believed.<br /><br />Although later post-rock bands such as Tortoise, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and Explosions In The Sky have attempted to replicate the power of this album, nothing can beat the original. Spiderland is pure emotion set to music, and one of the most powerful records of the '90s. Calling it \\"essential\\" is an understatement.'ve ever heard.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I loved \\"Slave for you\\"... when that song fist came out I realized, hey the girl CAN sing, and its better music than her BEGINNING nonsense where most her songs \\"Baby One More Time\\" just sounded like hiccupping....BUT this newest cd is awesome! Lots of guest vocals, and more of a hip-hop sound, but My favorite song is\\" BREATHE ON ME\\" a haunting, sensual, and dancable tune that I've played on repeat many times since my purchase.I don't know if her NEW voice is just studio magic, but this is a great cd, and I'm proud of the girl for changing the way her music sounds. It also reminds me, she IS trying to be Madonna.... this cd is soo sexual, it reminds me of \\"Erotica\\"... so maybe Brit's pushing the envelope as well, just faster. Can't say I'd want the girl spending the night at my house, but I do hope this cd does well for her. Point being, is really better than I thought it would be. A+ Miss Spears!
0887308589|4.0|For sheer humor, the Dilbert books and strips are great.  The way Scott Adams is able to illustrate the insanity of many common business practices in a few scenes or sentances is incredible.  On the bright side, because there are so many stupid things being done commonly, almost everyone can relate to Dilbert.  On the down side, there are so many stupid things being done commonly.<br />Relative to other Dilbert works, The Dilbert Principle is almost as good as Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook and considerably better than Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel.
B00018D3RI|5.0|This is so great; when I was a kid, before the VCR days, my girlfriend and I used to record the shows, just for the sound, with cassette players! We were crazy for those guys! I can't wait to see the shows on DVD!  The TNT re-runs were ok, but all the commercials!!!! My favorite episode and I think David Soul's best performance, was &quot;the fix&quot;.  And Paul Michael Glaser's best was in &quot;shoot-out&quot;! I recently bought the XBOX Video Game and got my son's interested in the new movie which we will go see.  I want them to watch a couple of the original shows first! I can't wait for my order to arrive!
0060955775|4.0|Ok I'll start with the pros, then I'll lash out the cons at the end.....first of all, I do think the plot of &quot;Veronika Decides to Die&quot; is intriguing and original (a young woman suffers a failed suicide attempt and lands in a mental hospital,  suspended somewhere between life and death, believing her days to be limited due to irreversible heart failure and acting upon this belief. During her stay at the hospital, her closeness to death renews in her an appreciation of the life she had attempted to take away. Through her exchanges with her inmates, she learns about love, madness, dreams, freedom and the need to break free from self-imposed inhibitions and social &quot;norms.&quot; Here, some interesting questions are raised in the novel...what IS the &quot;norm&quot;? why does society fear that which is different/erratic/new? why is being &quot;different&quot; considered a kind of madness? and who is madder....those who live as they please or those who destroy their dreams and limit their potential in order to conform?<br />The intended message is inspiring and beautiful .. one must discover the true value of life, the richness with with it can be lived, the meaning of living it. We should not be apathetic and resigned to the dull norms, instead we should savor every mad moment, every whim, every impulse we feel...so long as we do not cause destruction to those around us....sing in the rain, climb a mountain, paint, dance, laugh with the joy of life and living, unleash the individual within you and cry, scream, go out and follow your dream. It is an inspiring approach to our existence and the book answers to a modern-day malaise inflicting thousands of people world wide: boredom/apathy/depression. All of us meet face-to-face with sadness and emptiness at some point in our lives, and at such times we should take heed of some of Coelho's inspiring words in the novel: &quot;the 2 hardest tests on the spiritual road are the patience to wait for the right moment,and the courage not to be dissapointed with what you encounter along the way&quot; ..... there's another assertion by Veronika that I enjoyed reading: &quot;to smell the earth is to feel alive&quot; and &quot;the meaninglessness of life was no one's fault but mine&quot;. A beautiful message, much needed in this age of prozac and therapy...<br />HOWEVER, I am a very objective and critical reader, and my interest in the book's main idea does not change what I've always believed to be true about Paulo Coelho: he IS an overrated writer and a bit of a pseudo-philosopher as well....yes, he is interesting, but if you read his works, for example &quot;Veronika&quot;, you realise that the entire book revolves around one very elementary idea that he  fluffs up with pretty parables and cute little symbols and metaphors JUST to give the illusion of profundity....and while he's at it, he makes it a point to mention his own admission to a mental hospital in order to appeal to the reader's sympathy and to re-confirm that he writes what he writes out of personal experience and depth of feeling.... it is so obviously fake....unfortunately, though, this is what sells his books: he appeals to an exoteric, moderately intelligent audience whilst allowing them to believe that they have just read a work of great depth and perception ... and many also think that his &quot;simple&quot; vocabulary is a sign of his unpretentious, down-to-earth persona ....I think its just a sign of bad writing.<br />Yes, the book's message is great, yes, life should be lived happily and yes, one should sit back and assess the meaning of their existence and what they can do with their lives, but for god's sake if you're looking for depth, go out and read Hesse, Roth, Dostoevsky......ignore the Coelho fad and start giving credit where real credit is due! And in case you're still wondering, the 4 stars are for the IDEA/PLOT and not for the WRITING/DEPTH.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|1969's In A Silent Way is Miles Davis' first, and in my opinion, best foray into the world of fusion, a world that he hinted at with the prescence of electric piano on Files De Kilimanjaro. Unlike the heavy, brooding, and dissonant B-tches' Brew and the grating, rambling funk-jazz noodling that followed, In A Silent Way is eminently listenable and pleasant while still being far from ambient. Don't let the title mislead you--there's a lot going on in this album.<br />Basically, a continuation and augmentation of Miles' second quintet (consisting of Wayne Shorter on soprano sax, Tony Williams on drums, Herbie Hancock on piano, and replacing Ron Carter with Dave Holland on bass), this album adds three other notable jazz figures to the band. Joe Zawinul is on organ, Chick Corea teams up with Hancock on electric piano, and the incomparable British guitar deity John McLaughin is here, in one of his most restrained roles.<br />The sound is a subtle combination of cool jazz, funk, and rock. It's a credit to Miles' compositional ability that the three pianists never crowd things or sound muddy. Everybody knows exactly what to play and when to play it, yet the music has the best qualities of soulful improvisation as well. Despite the soft volume of all the instruments involved, there is much to listen to here. Just listen to the phenomenal interplay between all the musicians on hand, how Zawinul's organ runs perfectly compliment Corea and Hancock's chiming electric pianos and McLaughlin's laidback licks, how Williams' rockish hi-hat rhythms provide the backing, and how Miles blows out one of the best performances of his career. This is the Kind Of Blue of fusion, an album that all later melodic fusion recordings (including some of Miles' own) would be compared to and found wanting.<br />The only disadvantage to all this tasty music is that it lasts only 38 minutes. You'll want more. Hands-down my favorite Miles album, jazz purists be damned.
0425098478|4.0|This book provides a concise, easy-to-read overview of the basic principles of behavioral psychology.  The book concentrates on three basic principles: goal setting, praising, and reprimands; however, the key point to all three of these being effective is clear communication and understanding between the manager and the employee.  <br />The one-minute goal setting is an effective tool in any setting.  The authors recommend writing down the goals of any project or employee responsibility on one sheet of paper in 250 words or less, with a copy provided for review to both the manager and the employee for occasional review.  This is contracting with the employee for the desired results and has been shown to be quite effective in several behavioral psychology clinical trials.<br />The one-minute praisings also work across disciplines.  Providing brief, positive, immediate feedback reinforces the desired behavior.  Again, clinical trials have proven this to be effective.  The authors do a good job of reminding managers to actually do this and to do it in a timely manner.  Studies have also shown that the longer the time delay between the desired behavior and the positive reinforcement dilutes the effectiveness of the reinforcement.  The authors could have done a better job reinforcing the point that managers must be present to observe the desired behavior.<br />The one-minute reprimands work similarly as the one-minute praisings and, again, must be tied temporally to the undesired behavior in order to have the greatest effect.  Here, again, the authors could have done a better job reinforcing that the managers must be present to observe the undesired behavior and that the reprimands should only be used once it is clear to the manager that the employee knows the desired behavior and how to do it prior to the reprimand.<br />As a pediatrician, I am often trying to teach my patients' parents several of these same principles in regards to child-rearing, i.e. how to get a child to stay in bed, sitting at the dinner table and actually eating, etc.  In the future, I will recommend this book to my parents along with 1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12 by Thomas W. Phelan Ph.D., another very good behavioral psychology book.
B00007B8PF|5.0|This album is amazing, is the only one where you can find the 3 Young brothers playing in the same album with Malcolm Young(Guitar), Anguns Young(Lead guitar), George Young (Bass), Bon Scott (Vocals) and Tony Currenti (Drums).<BR>Love song is the best Ballad in the wolrd!!!!<BR>High Voltage (Australian release) is a must have for any AC/DC Fan.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I'm not one of those people who are impressed with the Pixar animation type films (i.e. &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; etc.), so it comes very easily to me to praise &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. More than a decade after its theatrical debut, it still stands as my favorite Disney film, along with the brilliant &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. There are not enough words that describe how superior and masterful this film really is. From the lushly detailed animation, to the amazingly structured characters to the award-winning songs to the haunting score. Everything about this film is top-notch. Ever since I watched this film in the theatre in 1992, it holds a special place in my heart. When you mention  &quot;Disney&quot; to me, it can only mean &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The thing I most love about this masterpiece is the Broadway-feel the directors gave to it. Songs such as &quot;Belle&quot; (and the reprise), &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; and &quot;The Mob Song&quot; are pure Broadway songs, thanks to the talented Alan Manken and Howard Ashman. But it's also the way the direction. The reprise of &quot;Belle&quot; is the most breathtaking scene in the film. Belle sings about wanting &quot;much more than this provincial life&quot; and the scenery of this song is stunning with Belle seen running in the hills - reminiscent of Julie Andrews in &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot;. The film also won 2 Academy Awards in 1992 for best song (the title song) and for its magnificent score. Not to be missed!
0385335482|4.0|I bought this book in a newsstand at the airport and I was so hooked I finished it in a weekend! <br />Becky Bloomwood seems to have it all: expensive clothes, socialite friends, and an apartment in a trendy area of London. However, she likes to shop a little too much and eventually is unable to pay her credit card bills. Becky avoids calls from creditors and makes up all sorts of excuses for not paying her bills on time. The further she falls into debt, the more she shops, as if she's trying to fill a void in her life. The ironic thing is that she is a financial journalist and she gives advice to people on how to save money. <br />Becky's attempts at cutting back are hilarious. She also tries ways to make extra money, such as working retail and assembling frames. Her creative ways of facing her problems attract the attention of both her bank manager and Luke Brandon, a handsome multimillionaire PR executive. However, she continues to hide her problems from her family and friends until she hits rock bottom.<br />Finally, when her hometown neighbors are taken in a financial scam, she finally gets herself together and sets out to help them. The road to success isn't easy, but she sets goals for herself and faces her fears. Becky also wants people to take her more seriously, and she overcomes this obstacle only with hard work and determination.<br />This book is fast-paced, light-hearted, and laugh-out-loud funny. I definitely found a kindered spirit in Becky Bloomwood. We have both lived way beyond our means on a publisher's salary! I highly recommend this book for anyone who has felt overwhelmed with their lives. I can't wait to read the sequels.

B0000039PW|5.0|What can I say? This is a rap wonder. The Notorious was Gloriuous and he showed us why. For the past 3 years b4 this album came out the west dominated rap, with albums like The Chronic, Doggystyle and G Funk Era. This album singlehandedly brought the East Coast back in the game and paved the way for other East Coast MCs like Nas, Jay-Z and Lil Kim. The reason being that Biggie knew what he wanted, and got laced up with ill beats by Puff Daddy, sampled or not (I cant imagin hearing Juicy with any other beat). In some songs like Gimmie Da Loot he shows us why he wasnt Mr Nice Guy, where some of his lyrics had to be edited. But i think the gem of this album is without a doubt JUICY! HE takes from the start to the finish and tears the mic up with the best song of all time. Doesnt cuss, simply describes how his lifestyle had changed. ...
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is definately one of the greatest movie last year. If you are the type of person that does not like all the computer graphic (like &quot;lord of the ring&quot;) and wanna see something that touches human inner side , then this is the movie to watch. I never knew bill murry can act something serious, but I like this role in this movie. If maybe confusing at the beginning of the movie, but as you watch toward the end, you will fall in love with it too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|that FOX doesn't know when it's got sci-fi gold.  Like another short lived sci-fi series that had tons of potential, Space: Above and Beyond, Firefly was cut down before it's time.  I'd just about given up on televised sci-fi.  Trek had gone down the tubes, Babylon 5 had ended, and the rest of the Sci-fi TV landscape was filled with absolute dreck.  Then along comes this wonderful series that had style, humor, intellegence, and made me believe in it's setting.  Of course, it was completely mishandled by it's network, but thank goodness for DVD.  Now with word of a movie, the Serenity will fly again - no thanks to FOX.

B00000IYWH|4.0|This album comprises Elvis' first studio recordings after his release from the army in March 1960. Recorded at the RCA Nashville studio, and four years after the release of his first album ('Elvis Presley'), Elvis proves how he is, at this point, a first-class, professional performer, in every respect. At this time, there were two performers in the music industry that were kings at the top of their game: One was Frank Sinatra, for the World War II generation and Elvis Presley, for the younger crowd. Elvis was the top act in the Pop/Rock genre during the 1956 to 1963 period and I would say that this album (and these recordings) were his best, most polished and professional, product of this period, certainly of his post-army period. Elvis made musical history during his Sun Records and early-RCA Victor days (1954-1956) but by the time of these 1960 recordings, he shows what a seasoned, mature performer he has become.  Elvis par excellence!:  'Make Me Know It'- Snappy, first-rate early '60s Elvis Presley pop song. A brilliant recording!; 'Fever'- Well-executed copy of Peggy Lee's 1958 hit single; 'Thrill of Your Love'- Beautiful, moving, gospel-flavoured love ballad; 'Such a Night'- Rockin' Elvis! Exemplary cover-recording of the Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters R&B hit; 'It Feels So Right'- Swanky, sexy and bluesy. Should have been a hit!; 'Like a Baby'- Slinky Elvis blues; 'Reconsider, Baby'- Enjoyable cover of Lowell Fulsom's 1954 blues hit; [Bonus Tracks:] 'Stuck on You'- Hip-swingin' 1960 pop music at its finest!; 'Fame and Fortune'- Fine '50s-style pop tune; 'It's Now or Never', 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?'- Elvis as the sophisticated, versatile performer. His biggest hits of the year; 'A Mess of Blues'- Terrific West-coast swing hit.  Competent but so-so:  'The Girl of My Best Friend', 'Soldier Boy'- Very competent early '60s sentimental pop; 'I Will Be Home Again'- Duet with army-buddy Charlie Hodge. Ballad performed in an old western, Sons of the Pioneers-style.The old-style reference dates it somewhat; 'Dirty, Dirty Feeling'- Recording of a 1958 Leiber and Stoller rock'n'roll composition (and 'King Creole' reject) done in the then-hip Nashville-flavoured rock'n'roll style. Fast-moving and, with 'Boots' Randolph's 'yakety-sax' stylings, somewhat silly-sounding in the outcome; 'The Girl Next Door Went Awalking'- Saccharine, B-side material; [Bonus tracks:] 'I Gotta Know'- A Top 40 hit but originally a B-side selection, and rightly so.  My favourite Elvis is his exposive Rockabilly and Rock'n'Roll period but I still enjoy his early-'60s, Pop-performer period almost as much. I find myself playing this CD alot! Elvis is back! Even 44 years later!
B000002OX7|5.0|This album is without a doubt The Who's greatest studio work, it is a fascinating compilation of some of the greastest and timeless rock songs of all time by one of the greatest and most talented rock groups of all time. <br />Track 1-&quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; Not much can be said about Baba O'Riley. It's just a really great rock song that you can listen to over and over and over agian. The synth intro is phenominal and as soon as Pete starts in on the piano the rock show begins!<br />Track 2-&quot;Bargain&quot; It's sad that The Who sold such a great tune to a F**kin car commercial, now every time I listen to it unfortunately I think about a Mitsubishi.<br />Track 3-&quot;Love aint for Keeping&quot; Great song. Fabulous lyrics and beautiful melodies create a nice easy to listen to rocker.<br />Track 4-&quot;My Wife&quot; This is my favorite on the album. It has a catchy tune and the piano rhythm is great. This tune showcases John Entwistle's real talent in writing and piano, both of which are usually ignored.<br />Track 5-&quot;The Song is Over&quot; This is a beautiful song. It is a step in the opposite direction for The Who, especially during their hard rocking days when this album was released, but I believe that shows The Who's range in ability and talent.<br />Track 6-&quot;Getting in tune&quot; Keith Moon has some great drum beats in this piano infused rock tune. Catchy and fun.<br />Track 7-&quot;Going Mobile&quot; A perfect example of The Who's ability to write a radio friendly widely appreciated tune that made a great single. <br />Track 8-&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; This is the real &quot;masterpiece&quot; of Who's Next. Pete wrote some truly phenominal lyrics and the band came together to create a timeless beauty.<br />Track 9-&quot;Won'y Get Fooled Again&quot; Anyone who watches C.S.I will know this tune as the theme song. It's just the right ammount of synth and rock to create a classic. My only complaint is that this tune is WAY too commercialized. <br />Track 10-&quot;Pure and Easy&quot; Nice easy rocker with nice lyrics and great drum work by the indespensable Keith Moon.<br />Track 11-&quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; This is a cover of the Marvin Gaye classic, with some of the tightest drum work I have ever heard. The Band also covered this tune quite a bit. It's just a fantastic song all around.<br />Track 12-&quot;Naked Eye&quot; Grungy tune with some phenominal guitar work by Pete. The last minute or so of this tune are the highlight, it almost sounds like Jimi Hendrix!<br />Track 13-&quot;Water&quot; I look at this tune as a continuation of Naked Eye. Roger Daltry belts out some great drunken vocals.<br />Track 14-&quot;Too Much of Anything&quot; This song was another step away from rock for The Who. It is pop infused single material. Without Roger on vocals it's hard to tell this is The Who. The only bad bit of the whole album.<br />Track 15-&quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot; This is The Who's shot at Bluesy Rock. This song has a wide variety of musical influences, it's got a little blues, some jazzy piano, a little folk, and still a whole lot of rock.<br />Track 16-&quot;Behing Blue Eyes&quot; This is the original version of Behing Blue eyes. It's a bit of a reprise, the only difference is the guitar is a bit different (and better!) in this one. Still a great tune, even twice!<br />Overall I recommend this album for fans of The Who definitely. But also for fans of modern Grunge and/or Rock, this album was a turning point in rock and roll it gave way to a bit more grunge. Nirvana and Pearl Jam especially were surely influenced by this album quite a bit
B00003CXDV|5.0|`Galaxy Quest' is an old, long discontinued TV space adventure series with an extremely geeky cult following. To put it another way, `Galaxy Quest' is `Star Trek' modified just enough to keep the intellectual property lawyers at bay. Its cast featured the macho captain Taggart played by Jason Nesmith played by Tim Allen; Lt. Madison played by Gwen DeMarco played by Sigourney Weaver, whose job on the ship is to repeat everything the computer says and have great breasts; Spock analogue, the alien Dr Larazus played by Alexander Dane played by Alan Rickman; and a few others. None of them have tasted remotely comparable acting success since, so they continue a little desperately to squeeze a living from their GQ celebrity. It's not something they mostly much enjoy, especially Dane who remains in his dreams at least true to his former self-conception as some great Shakespearean actor.  Even the normally enthusiastic Nesmith is starting to find the whole business depressing. <br />Meanwhile in a distant part of the universe, the Thermians pick up transmissions of GQ. Having no concept of fiction they assume they are watching reality: `historical documents'. Inspired, they model their society on the values they see embodied in the show. And then, endangered by a threat from evil alien Sarris, they turn up at a GQ convention to ask for help. Next thing our old troopers know they are on a very real replica of their fictitious spaceship and expected to take command in a serious emergency. A few large problems present themselves. Sarris, for one thing is desperate to know what the ships most spectacular hi-tech gizmo, the Omega 13, actually does. But of this Nesmith et al have no idea, they' re just actors after all. Indeed there is a pile of stuff about how everything works they have no clue about and they have to solve the problem by getting in contact with a few skinny geek schoolboys back on Earth with an unhealthy obsession with every obscure technical aspect of the TV show...<br />This is one of the very best American movie comedies of the late 1990s. The idea is a splendid one and it is stuffed full of rich comic conceits. It works beautifully as a gentle affectionate parody of the whole `Star Trek' world. And it works beautifully too as a self-contained, character-driven comedy. Indeed, comedy aside, just as an adventure story with good guys in conflict with ugly green baddies, it's a lot more exciting and enjoyable than 100 other sci-fi movies that play it straight. It is intelligently written, ably directed and very well acted. Rickman and Allen are especially good among those playing human characters; Robin Sachs is a brilliantly malign Sarris; but the film is completely stolen by Enrico Colantoni as Thermian Commander Mathesar, at once the funniest and most lovable alien you are likely to encounter at the movies any time soon.
0393312836|5.0|This novel, which I recently finished has touched me in a way no other novel has. After completing the book I was catching myself saying all the phrases Alex says in the story myself. This is a novel which should be read by any type of reader. My little droogs this razoodox is a real Horrorshow viddy! You will understand after you read the book! Trust me!
B0001ENY6M|4.0|John Debney's score, while reminiscent of Peter Gabriel's for &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, has a sound all its own, particularly during the crucifixion.<br />The music is haunting and moving. As the listener hears the music, they will recall the specific scenes from the film and will occassionally be moved to tears.<br />As interesting as the music, the story behind Debney's own spiritual journey and conversion during the creating of the score is equally as compelling. Clearly, the Holy Spirit was at work not only on the film, but on those involved in its various aspects.<br />This CD works well as background music while you're working, or better yet praying. It's a great companion piece to any of the number of books available on the film. I highly recommend it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|With their 2002 release...let's call it \\"Parentheses,\\" Sigur Ros has taken a massive step forward as the next Radiohead. I'm sure Sigur Ros would be appalled by that statement, but nonetheless it's exactly where they are headed despite their extreme efforts to be anti-pop. <br />Putting all self-servicing art-for-sake-of-itself nonsense aside, this is perhaps one of the finest records I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. On their previous offerings I felt the \\"songs\\" were too ambient and were never really developed as complete ideas. It was hard to find a discernible motif anywhere and you had the impression they were making it up as they went along.<br />On ( ) they develop their brilliant ideas more fully, and often entire songs are based around a simple repeating piano motif, which they build from a whisper to a scream, and back to a whisper over the course of seven minutes. The production is always bordering on the outer threshold of experimentation; you are sure to hear things you've never heard before. However, they present these unique sounds in a completely accessible way, so although it's new it is also intimately familiar. That, in a statement, is the definition of musical genius. <br />The highlights on the record are tracks 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8. I guess it would've been easier to say what *isn't* a highlight, but that's just how this record is. To me, the far and away best song is track 4 (I'm not giving song names because each track is \\"Untitled\\"), which in seven and a half minutes embodies everything that is spectacular about this record and this band.<br />Some other interesting tidbits...<br />- There are no lyrics on this record. Some listeners have mistakenly reported that Jónsi, the lead singer, sings in Icelandic. He is actually singing in a language he calls \\"Hopelandic\\" which is nothing more than an academic name for random syllables. Many times songs are written this way, with the singer just letting whatever comes out come out, and then replacing the meaningless syllables with actual words. Jónsi has forgone this last step and instead considers his soaring Thom Yorke-ish falsetto to be more of an instrument than lead vocal.<br />- Allegedly, the songs on this record were inspired by ancient Viking poetry.<br />- Jónsi, who is also the lead guitarist, uses a cello bow on his guitar to achieve the ambient, floating overtones. <br />- There is a thirty-second gap of silence after track 4. This is to separate the album from its \\"sweet\\" half into its \\"heavy\\" half.<br />I haven't mentioned being annoyed with the overt self-importance of the record - not including song titles, not including an album title, separating the album into halves, etc. - and I won't go into too much musing about it. I will say this - Sigur Ros isn't exactly helping an anti-pop image by doing this. At first it will be appreciated only by the \\"alternative\\" folk, and then the college kids will discover it and it will become pop, thus considered \\"uncool\\" by those that originally lauded it although nothing about it has changed. This is the typical pattern of genius. <br />Sigur Ros should just accept the inevitable. They are far too talented and ingenious to not eventually be recognized as superstars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never written a recommendation for any CD, book or movie before but this - this show deserves it. A wonderful mixture of great characterizations and actors, plots and scripts set in the most amazing and unexpected future. Truly, truly special.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I actually farted during this film and enjoyed the odor more that the actual movie..a true story.
B000002LCK|5.0|Cadaver dance music is what I first thought of when I brought the vinyl version of Low Life home, put it on my turntable and recorded it to cassette, and then took the album back to a store called That's Rentertainment.  It was a beautiful concept-rent an album for 2.99, record it and another album to a 1.99 high-density cassette, and everyone was happy (Well, except for Mr. RIAA, I suppose).  I was hooked though.  N.O. was THE group for those alternative times for me.  They embraced the horrors of the dance culture of the time by sprucing it up with Sumner's wonderfully dreary and droning vocals.  An afternoon with New Order, Gang of Four, and XYMOX was as good as it got back then.<br />Substance is an essential compilation CD by a seminal rock band.  While I've tried to re-capture that essence this group embodied by listening to the Chemical Brothers and Crystal Method, those groups just don't reach the same level(Out of Control by the Brothers is one of the better New Order songs with Bernard singing).  I also care little for the massive-bank-of-air-conditioners-running sound of most other club and rave music (what's that all about?).<br />But New Order has their own unique niche in the history of Rock and Roll and Substance is the album that puts together the pieces of why that niche is there.  Substance shows the progression from the hollow, sparse atmospheric landscape of Joy Division to the wonderfully bouncy, and optimistic beauty of True Faith, that was the capstone of that later era New Order.<br />This CD must be owned by any serious student of rock and roll history.
B000005C1B|5.0|What a dvd this is. The legend that was Roy Orbison performing his greatest songs with a band of all stars. Bruce Springsteen spends the whole time staring in awe at Orbison and the singing from the three ladies (warnes, Raitt and Lang) is nothing short of heavenly.<br />The sound quality is second to none, Waits is great, the boss is great - you just can't go wrong.<br />Must buy this as KD Lang says 'he didn't sing songs - he sang epics'
B00003CXAT|5.0|I got the DVD hoping the movie would still be fresh after all the years of not seeing it. Its theater release was amazingly successful. You know why? It is a Spielberg production to a Michael Crichton novel that is treated with respect. This is not trash that is all too prevalent in cinema today. This is a movie for all to enjoy, except for those who try to find something wrong purposely.<br />The cast is great. Sir Richard Attenborough has been in acting for quite a while and is perfect as Hammond, the tragic millionaire who's honest intentions prove disastorous (even if it's not totally his fault). Sam Neill and Laura Dern are totally believable as scientists who find themselves coming to grips with the revelations about their work and why their way of life could be jeopardized. Jeff Goldblum is immersive as the 'mathmetician' who argues the moralities and possible repercussions of the park. Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson support an already stellar cast.<br />Aside from the great performances, the story is really what makes the movie work. Michael Crichton sparked a timeless screenplay. You just have to assume that the innovative and ground-breaking visual effects at that time can hold an audience only for so long. The audience has to care about who's on screen as well as what is. It's a classic and merits its longevity. Oh...the DVD's transfer is great and sound is theater-quality perfect. The DVD extras are above normal fare. However, the whole package is a steal for basically an average priced DVD. I rank this as a must-have for collectors everywhere.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|After I finally saw this movie, it haunted me for days - it's not tradionally plot-driven, but it is more subtle and lovely in its emotions than most films I've seen.
B0000019PA|5.0|Magnificent. This album is so beautiful that i feel strange talking about it with others let alone writing a review of it. I listen to it when i am alone, mostly. I guess you could say it haunts me and rocks my world at the same time--two very good things.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Best Original Screenplay? Give me a break! They just want to give an award for this film because of Francis Ford Coppola. Lost in Translation was not going to win Best Picture and Best Director; therefore, they just handed over the Best Original Screenplay award even when there was really no writing in the film. They gave the award away to Sofia Coppola in order to make history. This destroys the integrity of the Academy Awards because now I think Best Original Screenplay is not about the writing, but by the name of the writer. If it was Joe Blow who wrote the screenplay, the Academy Awards would have said: &quot;Who cares!&quot; <br />Lost in Translation sucks! Plain and simple--it sucked!
0316779237|3.0|So far I have only read, \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" by this author and I can say that it was one of my favorite books!  I had never laughed out loud so hard at a book before.  That book left me very eager to read another one of Sedaris books and over the holidays I picked up \\"Holidays on Ice\\"  - - If you are looking for something to cheer you up during the stressful holiday times, pick up this little book by Sedaris.  It's short but full of great short stories that will have you chuckling out loud!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Something for everybody.  Britney has flavor...she's not so pop...she's everything.
B000067J1H|5.0|This movie is so good, it's still being hotly talked about and analyzed 5 years after it's release. This ought to tell the prospective viewer one thing:  Here's a classic that should not be missed! True, some critics say there's too much gratuitous violence, but this is more than balanced by the dark comedy and social satire that pervades it. There's a definite philosophical undertone here that can't be ignored which adds to rather than detracts from the whole experience. Anarchy, fist fights, and mayhem were never so much fun to contemplate till 'Fight Club' came out. For the record, in an uncommon twist, I felt like the movie was much better than the book it was based on. Beyond a hard-hitting script, solid direction, and great acting performances turned in by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter what else can I say?
B00008H2LB|5.0|THIS IS THE GREATEST BAND EVER, I HAVE BEEN TO THERE CONCERT AND IT WAS JUST AMAZING THEY WRITE THERE OWN SONGS, AND THERE WORDS ARE INSPIRING.I HAVE LISTEN TO THE BAND EVEN BEFORE THEY WERE LINKIN PARK. AND THEY GET BETTER WITH EACH PASSING YEAR
B00005QHPQ|4.0|This is a very good album as most of Enrique's albums have been (with the notable exception of &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot;) however, there is a much different sound and feel to this album. A number of the songs have a disco and/or R&amp;B rhytym to them. Generally I'm not a fan of disco, 70's sounding music or R&amp;B for that matter, but the blend along with some Latin rhythms and Enrique's talented singing work well on this collection.<br />I find &quot;Hero&quot; both in English &amp; Spanish to be particularly annoying (and dripping with sap) but then I suspect that this song isn't supposed to appeal to men anyway! However, all the other tracks are at least good and some quite good. The title track, &quot;Escape&quot;, has been a radio hit and is probably the best song on the CD, but &quot;Don't Turn off the Lights&quot; is also very good - sounds good in Spanish as well! &quot;I Will Survive&quot; has that 70's disco sound reminiscent of the original track from the 70's by the same title - makes sense! &quot;She Be the One&quot; has a definite R&amp;B almost Hip-Hop style to it - amazing how this guy can sing in different styles and make the songs work!<br />Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This isn't a good sci-fi show.  It's a good show period.  Sure, there are space ships and paranormal humans.  But the focus of the show is really about the crew.  The characters.  The changes they make over time.  Their interactions.  In other words...WRITING!<P>This show was awesome.  It really showed how a group of people with interests that were often times at odds with each other could come together as a family.  It didn't rely on fancy special effects to fill the story.  It had actual dialogue.  And it wasn't dialogue filled with &quot;...and if we just bypass the warp coil and balance the flow of metrion particles with a sub-space inversion field, we can stableize the tachyon matrix...&quot;<P>Unfortunately, FOX botched this show from Day One when they decided to broadcast the episodes out of order.  Although this was not as bad as if they did the same to &quot;24&quot;, for a show like Firefly with many ongoing story references, it really hurt the average viewers' understanding of what was happening.<P>Then FOX kept pre-empting it to show things like &quot;World's Scariest Police Chases: St. Louis&quot; or something like that.  So not only did the average viewer not know what was going on since the episodes were out of order, but it was almost impossible to watch the episodes since no one ever knew when they would come on.<P>Finally, they abandoned it altogether when it was starting to really take off.  Of course, this follows the pattern of some other well written shows abandoned by FOX: &quot;Space: Above and Beyond&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;.  We just have to have room on the airwaves for &quot;I Married a Big Obnoxious Joe Millionaire&quot; or something.<P>Bottom Line:  DON'T get the DVD set and watch the episodes in the order they were meant to be broadcast.  You'll be entertained and come to fall in love with a show that lasted only a half season.  Then you'll just be upset.  VERY upset with the FOX executives.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This spectacular movie offered new blood to the dying genre in the late 50's. It's vivid, literary and sexy.<BR>Bram Stoker Puritans will probably be offended by the freedom of this adaptation, but it actually illuminates some of the themes, that was only hinted at in the novel, especially the disproportion between Victorian morals and basic biology, rationality and sexuality, conservatism and spirit.<BR>Peter Cushing is a wonderful Van Helsing, arriving with the jingling laboratory of Enlightenment in his luggage, but at the same time dependent on the old cross and holy water. Christopher Lee is archetypical as the vampire, the erotic Nemesis of the repressed and repressing bourgeoisie, and his sexual charm is at least plausible, in stark contrast to Bela Lugosi's reptilian performance. It's one of Hammer's finest, only surpassed by the third instalment in the series, \\"Dracula - The Prince of Darkness\\" (1965).
B000002BUY|5.0|From the start to the finish, Science has captured something sacred when it comes to how music can sound. The song Redefine is a song with a great introduction to the cd, a funky verse, and an explosive chorus that sends a message. The next few songs are accompanied by great drums, bass, and the rest. They have now established themselves as proffessionals. Magic Medicine is a great interlude for this kind of cd. My Favorite Things and A Certain Shade of Green are next, but not in that order. They're accused of playing really good songs that display good messages in this area of the cd. Next, Summer Romance, with its jazzier sound, shows off a different side of Incubus. Nebula is a deeper sounding song with good everything, and cool structure. Deep Inside is a great song. Period. Calgone is one of the most innovative songs I've ever heard in that it goes on for nearly 20 mintues and is split up in to seemingly different songs. This cd is a must listen to for anyone who enjoys any shape or form of Rock music.
0345350499|5.0|This book...opens my eyes. I've read before this so many other Arthurian legends, and some of them put down the women and the Celtic religion. This book embraces them and shows you a different side of the legends. It brough characters to life, and showed what happened before Arthur and his sister Morgaine were born. It surprised me at first, how at the beginning Morgaine called Arthur, her &quot;lover&quot; but it later explains it wasn't their fault what happened. <br />Many Arthurian books I've read, they badmouth almost all the women. But this book gives you an insight, and is incredibly like something that might have happened. It is my favorite book now.
B00006BTCA|4.0|After owning this album for about half a year, I have characterized it as being dark and dreary with a soothing undertone.  I know that sounds weird, but let me explain.  Lead singer Paul Bank's voice is deep and dark.  It sounds like what I think of when picturing a rainy day in New York City.  Even though I have never been to New York City.  However, the background sounds create an amazing haze that brings you to another world.  The vocal/guitar combinations are intertwined to synthesize something very fulfilling.  Yeah I know they are criticized for sounding too much like Joy Division, whatever.  Everything comes from somewhere.  I think that Interpol has done something unique with their album, Turn on the Bright Lights. <br />If you're looking for happiness within this album, go somewhere else.  If you're looking for thoughts, this album might help you spark some.  I first loved this album for the guitar chords.  It definitely grew on me with each listen, and I didn't really like it right away.  Just give it a chance
0440238609|4.0|These books, all 3, are really captivating. I admit, to me, the first in the series (the golden compass) isn't as great as the rest. You have to be totally focussed on the reading, because the plot twists and the developments can confuse you otherwise.<br />Favorite series for life!
0380789019|5.0|This book was amazing! Wonderfully satirical in that dark, slightly morid way that I absolutely love. Richard is a poor, mundane office worker, caught up in his routine life when suddenly a pretty, albeit bleeding, girl falls practically into his arms. He's catapulted into a world that he knows nothing about, and is treated like a child by his new found friends while he discovers this world below London that he never knew existed. Hilariously frightening, this story takes all the aspects of fantasy, intertwining them with real human emotion. I would deffinetly recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, or even if you don't, this is a way to start apreciating the art of it. Also, it's a great way for readers who aren't firmiliar with Gaimen's writing style to begin to understand him. It's a GREAT book, full of twists and turns, and while reading you always have to remember one thing: Who can you trust when no one is trustworthy?
B00000IOSU|1.0|In reading dozens of the hundreds of reviews of &quot;Mirrorball,&quot; I was amazed that the majority of them were written by people who objected primarily to 2 things (that had nothing whatsoever to do with the quality of the songs or Sarah's performances of them):<br />1.  The album is a rehash of songs that have been released before on other CDs (perhaps more than once?).<br />2.  The noise of the crowd on many of the tracks was distracting.<br />For heaven's sake, don't folks read about an album before they buy it, or do they just blindly throw their money across the counter because the CD has Sarah McLachlan's name on it? It is clear from the information provided in the Amazon listing for this CD that it contains reissued songs that were performed live. If people find either or both of these things objectionable, they should save their money. Complaints like these should really be sent directly to Sarah (perhaps via her web site?) or to her label.<br />What couldn't be learned from reading the album information is that \\"Mirrorball\\" should be R-rated for its use of profanity, including the &quot;F&quot; word in &quot;Building A Mystery.&quot; Maybe I haven't been listening carefully enough to the words on her other albums (mostly I listen to music as background material while reading), but this got my attention like a slap in the face. Apparently only one other reviewer shared my concern, which I suppose is a sign of the times. Pardon our tender sensibilities, but I still find it offensive to hear this type of language without being forewarned--I expect it if I watching an R-rated movie, but not on a Sarah McLachlan CD. I wouldn't want my 8-year-old granddaughter listening to this. Some might argue that she probably hears worse than this at school and that may well be true. Even so, I choose not to expose her to it intentionally, just as I wouldn't sit her down with me to watch an R-rated movie.<br />This is the basis of my 1-star rating, however unfair that may be.<br />If you are looking for a sampling of Sarah's work and don't mind the sounds of a live performance, but DO object to profanity, don't buy this CD.<br />Of course, you could consider this review your R rating and go from there. (And Yes, I will be sending a complaint to Sarah and her label.)ay be.<br />If you are looking for a sampling of Sarah's work and don't mind the sounds of a live performance, but DO object to profanity, don't buy this CD. <br />Of course, you could consider this review your R rating and go from there.

B0001ADB8C|3.0|The title of this is &quot;The Dark Horse Years,&quot; implying a comprehensive discography of George Harrison's albums' 1974-1992.<br />Nothing could be further from the truth. Key b-sides and, the largest sin of omission (the non-album 1985 single &quot;I Don't Want to Do It&quot;) are missing. <br />I immediately felt ripped off after purchasing this. And record companies keep wondering why fans download music from the internet...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought Thirteenth Step and Mer de Noms at the same time.  After my initial listen of each album, I thought I preferred Mer de Noms.  Now, months later, I've found that the opposite it true; Thirteenth Step is one of those fantastic albums that creep up on you.  Now, I tend to put on Thirteenth Step more often than Mer de Noms, Aenima, Lateralus, or Undertow.<br />Also, this is a great ALBUM.  Like its brethren I listed above, you tend to listen to it en toto; the album as a whole is one work, and has a breath and a pulse of its own.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|John Debney has created a haunting and beautiful soundscape for &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; It takes you right back to that time when Jesus the Christ suffered for our iniquities! Fans of great film music will be more than pleased with this collection! Grade: A
B0000035E7|4.0|In the beginning, Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana were very much living on a budget, and their 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach,&quot; was recorded very quickly for a mere $600, resulting in a very raw, in-your-face, gloss-free grunge rock production. The rawness, and, some would say, the sonic *wildness* of &quot;Bleach&quot; doesn't have the surprising mass appeal of Nirvana's mega-hit follow-up, &quot;Nevermind,&quot; and it's apparent that the band were still in their &quot;teething&quot; stage at this point (even more so because drummer Dave Grohl hadn't joined yet--the drummer on &quot;Bleach&quot; is Chad Channing, who's good, but can't smash his kit like Grohl can). But &quot;Bleach&quot; still reveals a band of great rockin' power, and Kurt Cobain to be a talented singer/songwriter/guitarist who *knew* how to craft this kind of rock music, and who could also surprise you with the occasional pop hook. The best stuff on &quot;Bleach&quot; includes the catchy &quot;Blew,&quot; the original &quot;plugged&quot; version of the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; fave &quot;About A Girl,&quot; &quot;School&quot; (with Kurt's famous cry of &quot;No recess!&quot;), the Shocking Blue cover &quot;Love Buzz,&quot; &quot;Negative Creep,&quot; &quot;Scoff&quot; (with another great Kurt cry, &quot;Gimme back my alcohol!&quot;), the slow, muddy rock of &quot;Sifting,&quot; and &quot;Big Cheese.&quot; Some of the other tracks are, admittedly, a bit aimless, but they're good enough. Kurt's voice &amp; guitar are rough &amp; tough, Chris Noveselic's bass is monstrous, and, as already stated, Chad Channing is a decent drummer, but Dave Grohl is missed. (And by the way, former guitarist Jason Everman does NOT play on &quot;Bleach,&quot; though the band gave him a credit on the album as a friendly gesture). In the end, Nirvana's &quot;Bleach,&quot; despite it's flaws, is still a pretty awesome debut slab of take-no-prisoners grunge rock. Not bad for $600!
B000051YEG|5.0|All of the praised heaped upon this album is justified. It is a stone cold classic and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Sgt. Peppers, Revolver, Pet Sounds, Highway 61 Revisited, Exile on Main Street etc. The fact that Rolling Stone couldn't find a place for it on its 'definitive' top 500 (!) albums of all time is frankly ridiculous - it should be in the top 20 of anyone's list. The music is sparse, funky, atmospheric, sexy, with some of the best bass lines in Serge's catalogue. And with Serge's tradmark whisper floating over the top of the brilliant arrangements it sounds like nothing else out there, with the exception of Air and Beck's 'Sea Change' of course! (the reviewer who pointed out the similarity between Beck's 'Paper Tiger' and this album is spot on - in fact it's the string arrangements on the first two tracks that have most obviously influenced that song). So, all in all, this is Serge's finest moment, and yet strangely his most accessible - certainly as good a place as any for the curious to start to delve into Serge's fascinating career. And, as a bonus, this just has to be the coolest record of all time, complete with one of the best covers in music. Buy it and start your Serge obsession today.
B00003CX9E|5.0|The first time I saw this movie it was with a friend; it was the only good movie hanging around at the public library.  We both knew of its legendary status and where excited to see it (after all, it is #1 on the AFI greatest 100 movies list).  When we tried to see it, we nearly fell asleep, so we just kinda fast forwarded to the end.  While we both liked the style and direction, we felt the rest of the movie was lacking, and while the end was incredible, it took WAY too long to get there.<br />So in comes TCM, who was showing it.  When I saw it again, it blew me away.  I really loved it the second time around, putting it immediately on my top 10 list.  why the change?  I gets way better on the second viewing since you know the end already: the movie draws you into it as you watch a man and his dreams fall into despair and dust (literally).  the movie is as good as many people claimed, even though i would have given it 3 stars after my first viewing.  I guess people just need to realize that the audiences in the 40's were used to slower paced movies, and once youre into the movie enough, you cant get enough.  If you thought negatively about it, wait a while and see it again.  It worked here.
B00003CXA2|1.0|This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous accents, too many special effects, unbelievable story.<br />My pick for the worst movie of all time.

B000002HHB|3.0|After leaving the band that made her famous, Natalie Merchant opted to go for a lighter, different sound, which sometimes worked, but more often than not, slowed down the pace of the album.<br />Songs like &quot;Carnival,&quot; &quot;Jealousy,&quot; and &quot;Seven Years,&quot; are the closest you'll get to her days with 10,000 Maniacs, and that's still not very close. The overplayed single &quot;Wonder&quot; is the peppiest of the songs on the album, which does get slow and seems to drag at points, but overall, this is not a bad album; but it's not great, either.
B00018HU4U|4.0|I'm a jazz fan.  Her first album, \\"Come Away With Me\\" blurred the lines between jazz and pop.  I bought the second album in eager anticipation of the same approach.  At first I was a bit disappointed that she chose to move so far away from what made her a tremendous hit.  But I kept listening.  After a month I have discovered some jewels on \\"Feels Like Home.\\"  However, the overall effort doesn't live up to the first album, especially the sustained level of excellence of the first.<br />This is a common problem with sophomore efforts -- while the first album was written and refined over years, the second one is often written in a year or two.  I put the blame sqaurely on the record companies, pushing the artist to cash in on the success of the first one.  The real test of the artist is how he or she comes back with #3.<br />I'll keep listening to this CD.  But I will try to burn a CD with all of her first album and my four favorites from this say (I say \\"try\\" because the CD says \\"Copy Protected.\\"  Like you guys didn't learn that a solid album like her first sells a billion copies regarless of copy protection!)
B000006OAM|2.0|Though this album has a few catchy songs on it, the pacing and overall flow is nothing to get excited about. A far cry from the upbeat tunes of 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie opts to kick it down a notch (or ten) from her last album (Tigerlily), which was slow itself. Slow music is not bad, but it begings to drag and blend together after awhile, making very few of the songs on this collection memorable.
0790734850|5.0|To this day it makes me sick to my stomach to think that this perfectly rendered film-noir lost the Best Picture Oscar to \\"Titanic.\\"  That runs a close second to the 1994 debacle when \\"Pulp Fiction\\" lost the award to \\"Forrest Gump.\\"  People make mistakes, and I'm trying to forgive them. Anyway, this gem of a film was nominated for 9 Oscars, and the Academy members saw fit to give it 2, one for Best Supporting Actress(Basinger) and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.  The script is so razor-sharp that it is no wonder director Curtis Hanson collected what I think is one of the greatest ensembles in film history for the cast of the film.  Every actor here is excellent.  If I were a teacher of film studies, I would show this film long before \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  This is classic film-noir with a bevy of interesting characters, an intricate plot with twists galore, outstanding direction and cinematography, and brilliant acting everywhere.  I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough.  This is a genuine masterpiece.  \\"You heard it here first, dear readers.  Off the record, on the Q.T., and very...Hush-Hush.\\"
B000002HEM|4.0|I remember watching the original shortened broadcast of MTV Unplugged on TV before the album was released, and my first thought was that Natalie Merchant sounded tired during this performance. It's understandable, as the Maniacs were playing many dates in late '92 and early '93, but her last album with the Maniacs is also probably the worst. However, worse doesn't always mean &quot;bad.&quot; This is a nice reworking of some of their back catalog, as well as the surprise hit, a cover of &quot;Because the Night,&quot; that was worn out by excessive radio play.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I can't help but think the accolades this album has received is some sort of joke on us all. A social experiment gone awry. The army of young fans standing tall behind Elephant is very impressive considering this album stinks. The White Stripes are fun to look at, they are very stylish and cute, but the music is boring and tired. It sounds as if Jack White lets everything he writes go straight to CD.  No care, no concern, just fill a CD and put on the red pants.<BR>The first song, \\"Seven Nation Army\\", fires up the White Stripes gimmick with a lot of energy that goes nowhere. The rest of the album is where the first song leads...nowhere. It's all filler.<BR>My best guess on Elephant's popularity is it's a peer pressure thing. But remember this, boys and girls, the same club that requires you to like this album will someday require you to think it sucks. Confusing? Maybe, but it's a lesson that can be learned from a book that is required reading in elementary school, \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\"
B00005YXZH|2.0|Dear Jeff (Tweedy),<br />Please WRITE A NEW SONG. Every single Wilco album recycles the same freakin' songs, with just more and more production noodling thrown on top every time. (oh, and please stop ripping off Pet Sounds) Don't get me wrong, it's a great song, but for the love of god, give us something new. After reading the reviews for this I figured you guys must have broken out of your slump, but sadly, you are still wallowing in the muck of Summerteeth. or was it the first one? Or maybe that other thing. Crap, I forget. Oh well, I'm going to go listen to some Uncle tupelo and pretend you never happened. Thank god for file sharing or I might have actually wasted my hard earned dinero.
B00008J4P5|2.0|I'm updating my review of Elephant after reading through some of the previous posts here. One post stood out. Buried in this huge list of reviews is someone who shared his 1-star opinion and had the \\"big ones\\" to post a link to his own two-man show. His songs sound as if he recorded them in a dirty gas station bathroom during a fill-up while fleeing from the law for shooting his girlfriend and is now on his way south to meet his maker. Take that however you wish. Good thing? Bad Thing? Whatever. It rocks! Rocks with the kind of drive, passion, desire, and abandon that Elephant completely lacks. It's something I haven't heard in The White Stripes since \\"Fell In Love With A Girl.\\" If the silver lining to Elephant is that it puts a flame under people's asses to try and make something better, to know that they can, then, well, maybe Elephant deserves another star.
B00005JN02|5.0|Yeah, so I know that it technically wasn't even one of the five short-list nominees, but that was due more to the problems in the Academy's foreign film selection than to the film's quality.  This movie has won awards at nearly every awards show that it has taken part in, and is one of the biggest European films of the last year.  I saw \\"The Barbarian Invasion\\" and it was a good movie, but nothing compared to \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\"  I saw this movie last year in Berlin, and have waited with growing anticipation for it finally to be released in the US so that Americans could see what that reunification in Germany was not just about that one night with the wall coming down.  Imagine my horror when I learned that it was just going to be released in NY and LA; compared to the stupid and horrible movies that Hollywood generally releases in the spring, I can't understand why more cities couldn't have made room for a critically acclaimed foreign film.  In any event, if you live in one of the lucky cities, see this movie.  If not, see it once it comes out on DVD...just see it.  Open your mind beyond the swill that Hollywood placates us with...foreign movies are really not THAT scary, and this one is really funny.  Do yourself a favor...don't accept the lie that American movies are the epitome of cinema, if you don't see this then maybe \\"Spirited Away\\" or \\"Amelie\\" or \\"Osama\\" or any of the other beautiful recent foreign films..whatever it takes.  I'm not trying to be arrogant or pretentious...I just believe that life does exist outside of the USA.
B00005JMQ0|4.0|Errol Morris' Interrotron recording device faces down its most controversial subject yet in \\"The Fog of War\\". This wonderful footage is culled from nearly 20 hours of interviews with Robert S. McNamara, US secretary of defence under JFK and Johnson and the reputed \\"architect\\" of the nam war.<br />As the often cantankerous but well-spoken McNamara explains not so much his decisions as the contexts that produced those decisions -- as well as repeatedly saying that he's not going to talk about a particular subject, then talking about it anyway -- he dispels countless myths surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam and both of his commanders in chief.<br />More than a portrait of a savvy (if ethically challenged) bureaucrat, Morris'  documentary is a gripping survey of the last half-century of American politics and one that has much to say about the current administration's attitudes. Trust me, you're going to be glued to the screen.<br />One minor gyp though. It's not really clear what inferences I should have drawn from the reflections other than that war is hell, or that we should all love each other ever after etc etc. While we are on the gripes section, perhaps I should also mention that given its candid cam type feel, the footage is occasionally a bit tough to watch.<br />But that's just me. Watch this gem if you can. Highly recommended!

B000000H57|5.0|What more can be said about this album that hasn't been already said?  There's 117... uh, make that 118 reviews.  What I think listeners notice most about this album is that it's so 'full.'  It seems like the CD weighs more than that of other albums because of how much is stored on it!  The music definately can't be described to anyone who hasn't heard it, they simply have to hear it.  What I personally love about this CD and other TON music is the heavy use of the piano on many of the tracks.  You just don't find that in other heavy metal music.  TON has come to the next level of heavy metal, metal with a emphasis on orchestration, harmony, and excellant lyrics that convey all the serious &amp;  strong emotions--love, sadness, depression, longing, despair, loneliness, humor. They're all here. October Rust seems to never end, either.  The more you listen to it, the more you tend to hear in the songs that you might have missed the first few times around.  Every song is full of walls of harmony (mostly in the D-Flat scale, with a lot of progressive modulation for sure, the ending to &quot;Haunted&quot; is exactly what I mean, it's wonderful harmonious ensemble singing at its best &quot;Oooooh, I'm Haunted&quot;).  Peter Steele ought to do film scores!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I ordered Fight Club Special 2 Disc Edition since I couldn't find it in Toronto.  It arrived within 5 days in perfect condition.  I was extremely satisfied with the speed of delivery and the convenience of the service.  Definitely will order again!
B0000797IO|4.0|This is an odd movie to write a review for.  However, since most people reading this are looking for an answer to the question, \\"Should I watch this or not?\\" I'll give you a quick answer: Yes.  It's worth every penny- for a rental, at least.<br />\\"The Good Girl\\" is like no movie I've ever seen.  That's not a compliment, and it's not a criticism, it's just an observation.  I don't want to pigeonhole it into any one genre.  The movie has plenty of very funny moments, but it's not a comedy.  It's also rather depressing (at first) but it's not \\"black.\\"  It's dramatic, but can't really be classified as a typical drama (although that's the section it's in at the video store).<br />In short, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens.<br />THE GOOD:<br />There are a lot of very funny moments that will have you laughing out loud- sometimes at moments that you're not sure you should be laughing.  The cast performs every character in \\"The Good Girl\\" superbly, from Jennifer Aniston's ramshackle Justine to Jake Gyllenhaal's sullen Holden to Justine's slovenly but affable husband Phil (played by John C. Reilly).  Of course, I must mention Zooey Deschanel as cynical cashier Cheryl, one of the funniest and all-around best supporting acting performances I've ever seen.  And yes, I am now officially a fan of Jennifer Aniston, even though I'm decidedly a non-fan of \\"Friends\\" (I tried watching it after seeing \\"The Good Girl,\\" but couldn't get into it).<br />THE BAD:<br />Although the acting is great, it sometimes seems like they're acting in different movies.  Holden's movie is a bleak tragedy, Justine's is a finding-yourself drama, and Phil's is \\"Half Baked\\" (cheap joke, I know).  Justine is a hard character to empathize with, because you come to dislike Justine's paramour Holden more than her husband.<br />However, you do want Justine to find happiness.  But you know it's going to be hard for her to do so with any of the people in the movie.  She's not a heroine, she's not a villain; she's just a human.  She screwed up and she knows it.  It'll help to keep in mind while watching this movie that all it's characters should not be looked at as either protagonists or antagonists, they should be looked at as humans.<br />The movie left me a little depressed after watching it, but the more I thought about it the more I liked it.  It's a good cautionary tale.  One of the things that tells me if a movie is good or not is how much it sticks with me after I see it.  I rented this, watched it twice, and cannot get it out of my head.  I'm planning to buy it.<br />\\"The Good Girl\\" is good, and it's worth a rental.she's just a human.

6305922756|5.0|Twenty years after its release, This Is Spinal Tap is still in the running for the funniest film ever made.  This astonishingly clever mockumentary directed by Rob Reiner chronicles the \\"First Farewell Tour\\" of an aging British paleo-rock band.  Featuring brilliant ad-lib performances by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer and dozens of memorable minor characters, Spinal Tap launched an entire subgenre of sophisticated satire (think the \\"Simpsons\\" or \\"Best in Show\\"), but has never been surpassed.  The score offers such gems as \\"Big Bottom\\", \\"Sex Farm,\\" \\"Hellhole\\" and of course \\"Listen to the Flower People\\".  This band that never was--but somehow had to be--has continued to \\"fill a much-needed void\\" long after the real hair metal bands were forgotten.  Essential.
B000056H7W|5.0|I got this album after i got Damnation, i loved damnation so much, i wantd to buy more Opeth cds and the person who reccommended damnation to me told me to get this one since it is supposedly their best. When i first heard it i was liek, &quot;omg, this disc is soo different!&quot; After listening to it 20 or so times, i found that i like this disc more than damnation, because of the contrasting elements in the epic songs. Recently i've been going to their website, and reading how the albums were made; in the discography section. It's truly amazing, i'm now a full fledged Opeth fan, working on getting all of their albums.
006092988X|5.0|How is it possible that out of all the different literature classes I've taken (including a few American and a women's lit classes) that I have never heard of Betty Smith?  This is one of the best novels I've ever read.  The characters were so real, and the way Smith described the neighborhood and the culture made it seem as real to me as the world outside my door.  This is the book that when you finish you hesitate to read another book, because it's really not possible to measure up to it.  I admit that I was put off by the whole &quot;coming of age&quot; title this book seems to get, but it's so much more than that.  It's a beautiful piece of literature and Betty Smith is an important American and woman author.  I hope her other novels come back in print.
B00003CXFG|1.0|I dont understand how people could think this movie was great, it was so boring. Subpar acting by Vin Diesel as always, ok plot a plus, except for the fact of why there were so many civilians, the thing that ticked me off the most was the ending, it made no sense; did i miss something, or was vin diesel not a con. they should have ended the movie with everyone dying except vin diesel, if they wanted to make a sequal so badly.
B0000029GA|3.0|Yes Nas' lyricsm on the album is very thought provoking and advanced for 94 but the production just flat out sucks. This album is overhyped. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars on here never heard of Illmatic until Stilmatic came out. The album is too short and the produciton is terrible. There are about 5 solid songs on it but the rest is just garbage. Black Moon-Enta Da Stage is a much better album for the time. Go buy that before you get Illmatic. Illmatic is a pretty good album but it doesnt deserve the five that it got in the Source. Its generally just overhyped. On NAs' part the Album is a 5 but the production is a 2.
1400049628|4.0|I received a birthday package from a friend of 20 years that contained, 2 movies and a book. The movies didn't surprise me at all, but the book... lol. It truely made me laugh. I couldn't believe it.<br />A long time fan of Zombie movies, I had never really thought to read up on them. This book had pretty much everything you need to know summed up so nicely. I think now, after reading the book,I just might survive a Class 1 or 2 zombie attack if it ever were to happen. If its a class 3, I think I might be in trouble.<br />The book is very detailed on the pros and cons of weapons, best survival enviroments and supplies. It even lists what one needs for her own protection on her own or in a group setting.<br />The book also answered some questions about zombies that always nagged me in movies. Case in point, in the movie Dawn of the dead: Why weren't these zombies rotting? They were in that mall for months! Well.. I got my answer!<br />The book also eliminated the idea that a flame thrower would in fact take care of all your zombie problems. I know better now!<br />Its a good read, surprisingly funny and really is what the book is what it claims to be. A survival guide.<br />Even though my friend sent The Zombie Survival Guide to me as a joke, I feel more empowered. Lets put it this way, I have made plans on what kind of Zombie Fortess I want to build and made sure the certain people I need to help... they all know where to go when the sirens die down.<br />Thank you Max Brooks!
B00014TJ6Q|4.0|I see quite a few fans are overrating this one. Shouldn't we reserve the five-star rating for a work like ALL THINGS MUST PASS?  This CD is not in the same class as ATMP. It's warm, and often quite beautiful, but not really a classic. That said, I enjoy all of the tracks. The woozy &quot;Soft-Hearted Hana&quot; bugged me when I was younger, but now it makes me smile. &quot;Your Love Is Forever&quot; is one of George's best ballads as a solo artist. &quot;If You Believe&quot; probably would've been a big hit had it been released as a single.    Actual rating: 3.5 stars.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Kanye West will probably win the award in the weakest mcee flow category, however in his debut album release \\"College Drop Out\\", although his flow is weak, his lyrics are pieced together like a scholar.  Kanye offers a change up from your typical every song bling bling, shoot em up, female derogation rap lyrics.  Kanye explores life from a minority blue collar life style and touches upon subjects that most rappers would never dare discuss like religion in \\"Jesus Walks\\", family in \\"Family Business\\", racism in \\"Never let me down\\".  Backed by his strong production skills Kanye actually makes the blue collar approach work for him.   Although Kanye stresses throughout the album that education is not as important as making money he does offer a lot of positive subliminal messages. On this test College Drop Out gets a passing grade of 3.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Watching &quot;armagedon&quot; was like watching &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; dumbed down for an audience of subhumans. Bruce Willis ought to be condemned to living out his life in a garbage can for having had anything to do with this rubbish.<br /><br /> I guess if you believe that it'd be easier to train twelve roughnecks to be astronauts than it would be to train twelve astronauts to be oil riggers, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this peice of unadulterated drivel.<br /><br /> What I want to know, is: Why can't Bruce Willis appear in films with a plot that has some semblance of reality to it? &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; are great films, but then there are films like &quot;Armmagedon&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Die hard III&quot;, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, &quot;Hart's War&quot; and so on, ad nauseum.<br /><br /> If there really was a Hollywood Hall of Shame, Bruce Willis would have his own wing! Anyway, as of this writing, a used copy of this dog is selling for $.49 on amazon, but even that's too much...
B00005QW4K|3.0|It's the &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; and what more can you say?  You love it or you hate it.  I loved it - until I bought this DVD (bootleg/director's cut).<br />For some reason, on this version, they stripped out all the really good lines!!! ???<br />BTW - This movie is NOT horror.  Has some &quot;horror&quot; aspects, but its really a comedy - or it would be if they hadn't stripped out all the good comedy lines in the Bootleg edition.
0812548094|5.0|The second book was excellent.  It picked up right where the last book left off with the same force that the last book left off with.  There is no rest for those who read this book, it is jam-packed with adventure.  There are occasional points, yes, where the actions are predictable or trite, but there are far more that are completely unexpected or at least slightly different than what was expected.  The turn of events is tireless and consuming at the same time.  From one heartache to joy, to another heartache, this book keeps you on your toes.  You will find yourself happily wearied by this book by it's end, and yet still wanting to pick up the third book to find out what next is in store for Richard and those around him.  <br />The lessons in this book are thought-provoking.  If you look at this book as more than just a fantasy novel, you will realize that, whether he intends to or not, Terry Goodkind is making some very valid and intriguing observations about human nature, and may very well force you into making those observations as well.<br />One thing that was seemingly lost from the first book to the second was the understanding of Darken Rahl.  In the first book there is an attempt made to show the reader that even though Darken Rahl is made out to look evil, he isn't much more evil than everyone else, he simply goes about it in more dramatic and extreme ways.  He is likely no less evil than Richard's stepbrother, but his magic allows him to be brought to the forefront of the scene.  To some readers, this may make him seem overly evil and devoid of any real human nature.  However, at the root of his person, he probably isn't much more evil than even Richard, himself.  Only he carries greed with him more strongly, and in the form of wanting money, whereas Richard's 'greed' is for love.  Not to go on terribly about this point, but it should be made because the second book lost the sense of connection to humanity that Darken Rahl had in the first book.<br />This book is also very heavily ignited with romance.  The passion of their love for each other is all-consuming to Richard and Kahlan, and yet they still stay true to form.  Despite some peoples' criticism about their love being trite, their love is no more and no less strong than many new lovers seated in the real world.  The book captures the arousing, addicting feelings of love - new love, in particular - and simply displays how weak and how strong it makes us at the same time.  Very realistic.<br />As a final point of mention...Someone had mentioned of the first book that it rang of Dungeons and Dragons - it does.  This book has huge parallels to the familiar role-playing game and there were times, most especially in the first book, where I would think &quot;ouch!  he rolled a 1 on his will save.&quot;  For those of you who are DnD fans - this book should prove to be very interesting to you.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I really wanted to see this film. Mainly, like some people have said here, to see Bill Murray. Was I satisfied? Well yes and no. If I were to watch this movie before all the hype began to build I would have been giving you a 4 or 5 star review perhaps about how tragic this film entwines the characters but sadly when you put hype and Oscar nomination talk together it usually drowns out what might have been fun about the film in the first place. The film is brilliantly acted and it is really funny in places. As ever Bill Murray gets the best lines although Scarlett Johannsson does manage to get a few in herself and it does leave a distinct mark in your mind<br />So why 3 stars then? Well as I've said this film has completely been drowned out by all the critics' rave reviews of the film which is a shame really. What is understated could be passed off for underwhelming in some people's eyes. And I don't really blame them for thinking that. If this wasn't as talked about as it was - perhaps people could have enjoyed it a little more without some weight of expectation around it<br />I am glad though that the film picked up an Oscar. It deserved one if nothing else. It was, if anything, Oscar material.....but then usually I don't go for those types of movies ( American Beauty being a major exception ). I went to see it for 2 reasons - Bill Murray and I liked Sophia Coppola's last film - the fantastic Virgin Suicides.<br />So to cut it short I would recommend people watching this but I would also advise to lower your expectations - It isn't a major full blown piece - just a softly-softly film

B00007E8V4|3.0|Since their controversial and politically charged self-titled debut, System of a Down has broken many boundaries with their catchy nu metal riffs and Serj's odd vocals. With the mainstream success of their second release, `Toxicity', S.O.A.D. has gained an enormous amount of fans and popularity. Though to most of their fans that have been with them since the beginning, `Toxicity' was a lackluster, yet still good, release on S.O.A.D.'s part. Bringing back a few of the more extreme elements that their debut portrayed, `Steal this Album' is a collection of  tracks that did not quite make it on `Toxicity', B-Sides, soundtrack songs, and newly recorded material. The album as a whole is pretty much more of less on the lighter side of S.O.A.D.'S sound, as seen with their last release (though this is in a way expected seeing that a lot of these were recorded during the `Toxicity' sessions). The songs range in form from an acoustic track, to their normal fast nu-metal style, to a more hardcore approach - though the album is sadly completely devoid of the bands death metal influences. Lyrically the album goes in some odd directions. Some of it is purely nonsensical (\\"F uck the System\\", \\"A-I-E-A-E-I-O\\"), some is political (\\"Boom\\", \\"A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder)\\"), and still some are more of less social commentary (\\"Mr. Jack\\"). Vocally, nobody comes close to the bizarre pitch of Serj's voice and his odd style. Musically, Darren and the crew shoot out some pretty good riffs and perfectly executed drumming. No matter how strange it may seem, it is a completely amazing concept. Besides the acoustic track and the more or less anti war theme to most of the songs (which I though to be pretty lame...or at least in my views it anyway) I really don't have that much to complain about - song wise, I still think that they should go a lot heavier and a lot darker, but hey. Without a doubt, System of a Down still manage to be at the top of the nu-metal genre, yet at the same time still release well produced and well thought out albums that actually have some entertainment value. If you like System of a Down at all `Steal this Album' is a necessity.lease well produced and well thought out albums that actually have some entertainment value.

0767817478|4.0|This movie aint that bad, I mean I am a fan of the old godzilla and I think this is another great chapter to the series no matter what other people say,and I think the new appearance of godzilla is awesome and way bigger than the old movies. and I honetly think this movie had a pretty good storyline to it. I admit godzilla ending up getting killed at the end was pretty stupid, I mean what were they thinking when they did that I dont know but besides that the car chase at the end and the part where they lured godzilla out were pretty exciting, but the whole baby godzilla thing was stupid these things are just wanna be raptors off jarassic park. the dvd itself makes this movie better sound wise and picture wise, and I tell you what if you think godzilla 2000 is better than this you could not be wronger, because that movie stunk. I think the best part of the movie itself though is the parts where godzilla is not trying to get killed when he first comes to the city and all the buildings and stuff are falling down,and the old man on the pier is hilarious.One more thing please do not buy this movie even a little bit for the extra features because thet stink they are the worst extra features ever. well if you believe the other reviews that this movie stunk you should at least give it a try and go rent it at your local video store, and if you dont at least give it 3 stars come mark no that my review wasnt helpful to you, but if you do like it at least take the time to mark yes on my review, thanks. p.s the helicoptor chases are pretty exciting too, but once again the baby godzilla thing was really stupid.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Jason Bourne is a CIA operative who kills for a living. His hesitation to kill in one instance nearly costs him his life and results in almost complete memory loss. His life is saved by a group of fishermen who rescue him unconscious on the open seas.<br />The rest of the movie deals with his attempts to regain his memory. He meets up with a German girl in Zurich who helps him along the way, and suprise, suprise they get romantically involved. Will these cliche'd romances ever end in film? <br />The film is action-packed from start to finish. Matt Damon is convincing as an assassin and perhaps his work in the Talented Mr. Ripley helped to create this impression for me. There aren't any suprises in the story and most of it is fairly straightfoward. So if you like movies which keep you guessing till the end, this one may not be your cup of tea. <br />If on the other hand, you love action films, which aren't totally mindless (See all films by Schwarzenegger) and have great acting, then this film may be for you.
B0000507R0|5.0|This review refers to the DVD-Audio disc.  I echo the accolades of the other reviews written here, indeed a superbly produced rendition of the ELP masterpiece and highly recommended for not only ELP fans, but for the connisseur of high quality surround sound.  My only observation is that the advertised &quot;Advanced Resolution Stereo Track&quot; seems nowhere to be found!  I enjoy the surround tracks immensely, but for true high resolution (at times up to 24/192) I prefer the stereo track.  It seems odd that Rhino would package this disc advertising it to have that track when it does not.  Same is true for the Chicago II DVD-Audio disc.  Otherwise, this one's a keeper and especially for those who not only enjoy the quality of the music, but the quality of the SOUND as well.
B0000CDL93|4.0|Oliver Stone does an excellent job of arguing the case for a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. The facts, and some of the unexplained mysteries, all documented, are presented to the viewer in a most compelling way. You come away from the film wondering if there really was a conspiracy.<br />This movie does not have the feeling of paranoia that most other movies about conspiracy have, and here I am thinking of &quot;The Enemy of the State&quot; for example. The calm and rational development of the argument, with more information gradually added distinguishes this work from other more frivolous films. A line in the film which I think is quite telling is that if the assassination had happened in Russia, and the facts were as they are, would the idea of a conspiracy be that hard to swallow. It may be the willingness of the public to disbelieve the possibility of a Government that works against it's people, rather than the lack of facts, which makes conspiracy so difficult to believe for many people. <br />Even though Stone was true to the facts as he found them (or as others furnished them), he did take artistic license in some areas. This does not make the point that the movie is trying to make any less valid. Any movie about historical events, usually has some sort of creativity in it regarding minor events such as the flawlessness of the speeches, flashbacks, additional dialogues etc...<br />If you aren't one who buys into Conspiracy but who enjoys a good film, Costner's performance is stunning in this one and wont disappoint. The movie, in it's own right is excellent, and I would highly recommend it for it's own sake. Whether you believe the arguments or not, get this movie to see the story from the other side.
078062999X|4.0|I have &quot;collected&quot; Hamlets in the sense of seeing many stage and film versions for more than 30 years, from off-off-Broadway goofs to Laurence Olivier's and Branagh's so-called masterpieces.  The fact is that the play is Shakespeare's most difficult in many respects.  Most of the major characters are deluded, mad, or pretending to be deluded or mad.  Even stating what the play is about has nearly exhausted the imagination of 20 generations.<br />There are things in this version I object to--most especially the handling of the duel and bloodbath at the end.  It is over the top and physically unbelievable, detracting somewhat from the viewer's ability to feel for the characters involved.  But having said that, all-in-all (and &quot;all&quot; of Hamlet is a lot!), this is the best production I have ever seen: complete,in the proper order, with excellent performances by Branagh and Winslet and ESPECIALLY Derek Jacobi as Claudius.  When Claudius makes sense, the play makes sense, and while I have other favorite Hamlets and Ophelias and Polonius', there has NEVER been a Claudius so brilliantly portrayed.  The production values are brilliant, the music fine, and the overall representation of Shakespeare's most haunting work unequaled.<br />So where is the DVD?!?!?
B000000WCA|4.0|The British have musical phenomena that we Americans do three quarter flips and tuck dives headlong into.  The two British music invasions showed how much we accepted the Beatles, Stones, Duran Duran, and Eurythmics.  So were the Spice Girls the probing vanguard of the third extended gradual invasion that became transformed from pop/dance to alternative acts like Dido and Coldplay?  What impact did Parsley, Sage, Rosemary...oops, I mean Sporty, Baby, Ginger, Posh, and Scary have?  Well, in the UK, this album harkened back to the day when more than four singles were spawned from one album.  Indeed, all six of their singles here shot to #1 on the UK charts.  Eight years after the fact, here's a post-mortem.<br />The infectious &quot;Wannabe&quot; still retains the same fun it did when it became a transatlantic chart-topper, with that loopy &quot;tell you what I want, what I really really want&quot; line repeated, and lead vocals traded between all five, of which Parsley and Rosemary... I mean Sporty and Emma have the best vocals, with Geri and Mel B achieving a kind of contrasting balance.<br />If one feels there are two separate sounds here, the intuition is correct.  Pop-like songs like &quot;Wannabe,&quot; &quot;2 Become 1&quot; and &quot;If U Can't Dance&quot; were produced by Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, while the more R&amp;B stuff was produced by Absolute.  However, the 70's disco synths mingled with a strong R&amp;B bass beat of the mid-paced &quot;Say You'll Be There,&quot; the second single, places this somewhere inbetween, despite being produced by Absolute.<br />&quot;2 Become 1&quot; still has its power as the best song here as a smooth inoffensive string-laden ballad meant to soften the hardest of hearts.  I say meant because not everyone is impressionable.  The strings arrangements were courtesy of Craig Armstrong.<br />If &quot;Love Thing&quot; had been done in the 80's, it'd be a perfect Culture Club number, done during their &quot;Miss Me Blind&quot; period, and &quot;Last Time Lover&quot; and &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot; have the R&amp;B stylings that the All Saints would take further.  The big offender is the cloying ballad &quot;Mama,&quot; which still makes my stomach bacteria scurrying for cover.  Send yo mama a card instead if you really love her.<br />The scratching guitar, synths, and brass section of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are,&quot; the fifth single, is a nod to upbeat 70's R&amp;B, and is one of the best songs here.<br />The rap-versed, soul-chorused &quot;Naked&quot; is the one song that actually deals with the empowerment, gender equality, with equal and honest communication dynamic prevalent in Girl Power.<br />Along with a strong pulsing bass and a sample of the Digital Underground's &quot;Humpty Dance&quot; and a Spanish rap by Geri, &quot;If U Can't Dance&quot; sounds more like one of Absolute's contributions, though it isn't.<br />Image-wise though, all they did was take 70's-style feminism, taking to heart Madonna's line &quot;express yourself&quot; and package it in black Gucci dresses, Union Jack wonder-bras, baby-blue eyes, and football trainers.  And using that dynamic of certain artists/bands dominating certain years via vested corporate interest, well, 1996 was their year in the UK and Europe, 1997 being theirs in the US.<br />At least they wrote or co-wrote all their songs here.  Some charm still remains from this debut effort, given the sound and great vocals by Mel C. and Emma, who turned out the best solo albums of the quintet.  If anything, this was the first salvo in the Spice Revolution, but think of what was to follow in the UK and here:  a slew of imitators and, get the extra-size upchuck bags and bazookas out, boy bands and Britney (urgh!).

0385510438|4.0|This is a tale of one town Clanton Mississippi but in a way it is two books. The first is a story of the Danny Padgett case and the young crusading newspaper editor who makes his smalltown weekly on the strength of his coverage of the trial.<br />It is also a tale of race relations in rural Mississippi as change finally comes to Clanton.<br />Unlike several of Grisham's latest legal tomes, the trial story rings with authenticity. I would have preferred greater development of the Padgett case, leaving the second story as an excellent subplot. Both stories would have been more meaningful.<br />But make no mistake, while this is not A Time To Kill (also set in Clanton) it is his best legal thriller in many years. It could have been more thrilling, thats all.
B00005CDNF|5.0|The third album by the Swedish quartet is not only one of my favourites by them, but established their staying power by two Australian #1s, one of which spent eleven weeks at the top, and made them more visible by their putting promotional film clips, nowadays called videos, for four of their songs.  It's also more tightly produced than Waterloo, which was a proving ground for superstardom.<br />First, the song that became ABBA's second #1 UK hit and the eleven-week Aussie hit:  &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; with its bursts of guitar, catchy dual harmony vocals by Agnetha and Frida, and synths that have a slightly classical tinge to it.  One thing in learning about these guys is that they were a big hit in Australia, small wonder then that this song and other ABBA references were heard in the Adventures of Priscilla movie, Australian, of course.<br />The worldwide hit and third single, &quot;SOS&quot; featuring a pleading vocal from Agnetha set amid the usual awash guitar and synth, was considered by many to be ABBA's first classic single, but I tend to give that honour to &quot;Waterloo.&quot;<br />The slower-paced &quot;Hey Hey Helen,&quot; punctuated by a hard rock guitar and bass, portrays the cost of a woman who's free from the responsibilities of motherhood and getting that second chance, at the cost of leaving behind her husband and children.  A song fitting with the rise of feminism in the 70's.  And at least alternative group Lush saw fit to cover it on their Gala album.<br />The mid-paced &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot; is their shot at reggae.  Some Stevie Wonder-like keyboards and guitar open the Bjorn-sung &quot;Man in the Middle,&quot; about something really living the life of Riley, &quot;drinking champagne in his limo&quot; having lots of servants in his mansion, no conscience, and someone who deals with the Devil.<br />The galloping rhythm section and scat-like words used in the chorus of &quot;Bang-A-Boomerang&quot; make this another favourite.  They wrote the song for a Swedish group who lost out in the Eurovision Song Contest, and thought it was too good to let go to waste.  So do I.  Like &quot;SOS,&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia,&quot; there was a promo clip for this one, and the next song.<br />With a title like &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do,&quot; one wonders if the song's about five people at the wedding altar.  It isn't, but it does involve emotional commitment.  Soundwise, think of a country song with a sax instead of a steel guitar.  They got inspiration from 50's orchestra leader Billy Vaughn's sax-laden music.  This was another #1 Australian single.  It's B-side, the Bjorn-sung &quot;Rock Me,&quot; peaked at #4 and one wonders if his voice was in shreds the way he shrieked the vocals.<br />The instrumental &quot;Intermezzo No. 1&quot; is a brisk, racing classical-like piece incorporating electric guitar, synths, and orchestral strings.  It's well-named, as in classical music, an intermezzo is a short orchestral piece or movement separating major sections of a symphony, or in this case, separating two songs.<br />&quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; is my favourite song here, showing Agnetha putting her all, backed by string-synths and acoustic guitar.  The mood's quiet when she sings &quot;And finally it seems my lonely days are through,&quot; then she and Frida lay out the title to as close as operatic splendour as they can.<br />&quot;So Long&quot; is a more jamming rocker, with a protagonist unimpressed by a showoff's fancy car and money, not even flowers.  One particular line has three rhyming words, an interesting rhyming device:  &quot;Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy.&quot;  The band's accompanying lower-register harmonies singing &quot;honey honey&quot; or &quot;money money&quot; is a direct contrast to Agnetha's vocals.<br />&quot;Crazy World&quot; is my second favourite song, as it's a leisurely ballad sung by Bjorn about a guy who gets a rude surprise when he sees a man closing his girl's front door.  However, it's not what it seems, fortunately, but he realizes that yes, it is a crazy world.  It was originally the B-side of Arrival's &quot;Money Money Money.&quot;<br />The traditional folk medley done at the end has ABBA's brisk arrangements on &quot;Pick A Bale Of Cotton,&quot; something not so PC now, while more relaxing sounds permeate &quot;On Top Of Old Smokey&quot; and an Elton John like rocker on &quot;Midnight Special&quot; which rounds out one of the quartet's best albums.oor.

B00005A46T|2.0|To me, this band is not death/black metal at all, but I really DON'T CARE about genres when rating something.  Also, a lot of people say \\"this band is not true metal, listen to all these bands that I like that I'm sure you've never heard about\\".  The bands being mentioned are truly awesome.  However, do you really want posers to take over the music you like?  For example, lets say Slayer releases a new CD.  Now, let's say the sound is maybe even just a LITTLE bit watered down.  This CD makes Slayer popular with a lot of people, especially high school/junior high goths.  Now, all you people who have been beating it into everyone's head that \\"Slayer is better then Slipknot\\" (which I happen to believe is true), will be thinking \\"OMG SLAYER IS NOT UNDERGROUND AT ALL NOW AND THEY DON'T SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME SO THEY ARE SELLING OUT!\\"  It happens with PLENTY of bands.  Futhermore, good production quality is a good thing but it doesn't suffice for real talent.  Anyway, giving this a lower score for good prodcution quality would be foolish.<br />With that all said, this rating is not based on Slipknot's popularity, or non-deathmetalness, or young goth posers liking them.  It's about how they sound, and they sound TERRIBLE.  I mean, the lyrics are even more mindless and irritatingly profane then any band I've ever heard.  Half of their members really aren't needed.  The riffs are uninspiring.  The bass: where is it?  The drummer and vocalist (when he actually sings, which is rare) are both alright, but I've heard much, much better.  Furthermore, any rap combined with metal is terrible, and fortunately there isn't as much of it here as you'd think.<br />Bottom line: Noise put together in random haphazard patters is not really music.  Gave it 2 stars because there are worse bands (I.E. Drowning pool).<br />NuMetal bands that actually have talent:<BR>1. Tool (though this barely counts as NuMetal)<BR>2. Mudvayne (great bassist, interesting strange lyrics)<BR>3. Disturbed (greatvocalist, catchy songs).<BR>4. System of a Down (yes, they have talent although they repeat their riffs a bit too much)<BR>5. Chevelle (somewhat emo sounding, which I absolutely despise, yet their songs are interesting and played well even with only 3 members)
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is surely a knockout! When I heard that the producer Kanye West was releasing an album of his own, I predicted nothing but greatness and that is just what I got. He may not be on the same page as Jay-Z and Nas, but I'm sure Kanye is surely going to make his mark in the history of hip hop, not only as a chart-topping produer, but as a great lyricist as well. This is an album that I would recommend to anyone who has fell in love with any of Jay-Z's albums. This is an album that I can listen to from beginning to end and I don't have to skip songs. Kanye, keep the hotness comin' PLEASE!

DURAN DURAN IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS IN HISTORY. DURAN DURAN ARE LEGENDS AND SUPER LEGENDS. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GREAT ALBUM.
0385504209|5.0|Reading some of the reviews, I am taken aback at how seriously some people are taking this book.  Dan Brown says he poured a ton of research in the book.  Critics say the book is a bunch of malarkey.<br />Personally, what matters to me is that I finished the whole thing in less than a day.  I can't think of another book that I've read recently that really captured my interest more than this one.  The chapters are short and always end in cliffhangers.  The story is filled with, if not truth, at least INTRIGUE.  The mere fact that this book has been so controversial makes you want to get into it even more.<br />In short, this book is just FUN to read!  Even if it is a BIT of a stretch and the characters seem to be grasping for anything that even remotely ties into their theories (anagrams and all), it makes the story interesting.  For a work of FICTION, people, THAT is what I think matters in the end.
0385510438|1.0|What a disappointment- the introduction sounded soooo interesting; well, the book was interesting up to the point of the trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt; Then, instead of projecting ahead as the book promises after Padgitt gets out of jail in 9 years, Mr. Grisham is now rambling on and on; i am two thirds through this book (by the way i started out absolutely loving it) and there is still no mystery, no suspense about the revenge of Danny Padgitt-so when does the retribution begin Mr. Grisham? did you get lost somewhere in time and begin to love your writing to much you forgot where the storyline was going? I wish i could get a refund.  You know the real kicker is, i really enjoyed the book so much until Mr. Grisham got lost in space somewhere with all the characters in this town in Mississippi-- puh-lease--i will finish the book because i bought it but i would not recommend you spend your hard earned money on it; if you must wait till it comes out in paperback if you can't resist Mr. Grisham's books.
B000002U9Y|3.0|I am personally not a fan of Barrett-era Floyd, and I find this album to be a tremendous step forward from the psychedelic sillyness of its predacessor.  Although Syd Barrett's work is not without its merit in terms of creativity and emotion, I think it pales in comparison to latter-day Gilmour-Waters collaborations.  <br />A Saucerful of secrets is the first of many steps the group would take toward greatness, and it shows in  nearly all the tracks.  &quot;Coporal Clegg&quot; retains a bit of the narrative whimsy of Pink Floyd's early work, and &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;  (the only Barrett-penned track here) although perhaps one of Barrett's best, is merely an afterthought on this album.  It is the last look towards home before starting on a long journey.<br />The albums that would follow &quot;Saucerful&quot; would all but eclipse it, but it remains an important waypoint in the evolution of the band, and it contains some of my favorite tracks by Floyd.  &quot;Set The Controls&quot; remains a timeless classic, and has its place among   their best work.
0060920432|5.0|Flow (optimal experience) is something we all strive for and this book provides many chapters designed to help us recognize it. The key to this excellent self-help book is that it helps us understand our inner self first prior to providing cheesy solutions. Just like the 12 step AA program you first have to admit something and recognize it, only then are you ready for change. After reading this book, it was easy to admit that I am not in an optimal state all the time, when perhaps I could have been. <br />&quot;Hello, my name is Loopy and I'm not experiencing life in an optimal manner&quot; <br />Ok, let's get serious. In this time of hostilities it is more important than ever to recognize why humans try so hard to conquer the outer world. Mihaly concentrates entirely on how to achieve flow, therefore prescribing proven techniqes to control your state of mind (inner world) and improving the quality of your life. <br />Flow is simply immersing yourself in an activity to the point of losing sense of time. That activity can't be too hard or too easy, just enough so that you instinctively know that you are learning and expanding. Learning to effortlessly drive a golf ball, play guitar, converse, dance and work can all provide the state of Flow. <br />Mihaly starts the book off with an interesting general visit to the happiness subject and asks all the right questions. He presents a strong argument focusing on how humans throughout history have focused on how health, beauty, money and power will be our shining knights, yet we only have to look inside ourselves and stretch ourselves to experience precious moments. That perfect golf swing. Writing a great review. Cooking a great meal. It's just too easy in our society to flick channels and grab a greasy burger. You have to create optimal moments. <br />In the chapter discussing consciousness he tackles a tricky subject by first admitting it is a complex subject, but offers some interesting explanations. Consciousness can be &quot;intentionally ordered information&quot;. Our conscious actively shapes events for us providing a sum of all we have heard, seen, felt, hope and suffered. He is one of the only authors that I stuck with, on this complex subject. I have a clearer understanding as to why I do things. This is an important step to changing my ways. <br />Mihaly also looks at optimal experiences in our culture, thus looking at the bigger picture. His insight in how the industrial Revolution actually shortened some lifespans and put children at work very early is a great example how our behavior evolved innocently until it was too late. Even today we are working longer hours with modern technology. Is our present culture in the optimal state? I don't think so. <br />The book also looks at developing Flow through the body (yoga) and senses, with examples of the joy of seeing and hearing (music). <br />The subject of Flow and work is well presented as he provides examples of how people have found optimal experiences in mundane jobs. <br />The family is also discussed and it is easy to understand how we become dull with our family, neglecting to input energy and time. <br />Mihaly is one of those authors that truly cares for the human race and makes an effort to solve some very complex questions with a common sense approach. Now I want get out there and seize the day.

B00009V7T2|3.0|Very few people listen to prog anymore. I don't listen to prog, and chances are that you don't listen to prog either. The reason you don't listen to prog is because prog is essentially dead. Gone are the days when one felt moved by a promissing group of pretentious Brits, as the seemless transition between each of their meticulously arranged songs caressed the part of one's brain that could dissect sound in harmony. Alas, those days were mighty fine days.<br />Let me tell you what made prog so good. Prog, intrinsically, was not composed of melody backed up by rythmic sections. Prog was composed of eclectic themes taken from human experiences, exploited by a number of avant-gardist sounds. For example, listening to Dark Side of the Moon was like looking at your insane cellmate's head through the dark puddle in your room at the local asylum. The sound effects used to create this form of impressionism encompassed footsteps, computers, heartbeats, and more, yet not one of the latters felt out of place. And prog didn't just exploit a theme; a young man's guitar seemed to find just the right blend of texture and virtuosity to make the experience of listening to a prog record breathtaking.<br />The Mars Volta, however, does not tell you a story, nor does it exploit a theme. The lavish amount of tracks playing at the same time do not inspire you, and more importantly, they are in no way beautiful, or in harmony for that matter. The sound effects featured on this album seem to have been taken out of a producer's catalog wantonly, as they feel manufactured. And that's not the only drawback to the extensive use of meaningless sound: somewhere between the third and fifth song, one's brain begins to hurt.<br />Maybe &quot;painful&quot; is the best adjective to describe this album. Why? Well, this record IS painful. Physically. The ol' &quot;obvious latin guitar solos and one hundred dollar synths with horrible lyrics sung without talent&quot; mix tastes like orangina flavored cigarettes. Orancigaginettes, if that was a lyric in this album.<br />Finally, this record isn't fun at all. That it to say, no energy is transmitted through the rapid fireguitars and suck-and-blow sound effects. This energy would be unwarranted if the record sounded good, but it doesn't. This record is a boring long-winded mess of aimless guitar noodling accompanied by mind-numbing light shows.

But one of the reviewers wondered that the DVD offered no insight on \\"how and why\\" Voyager was developed ...  I can supply some pieces of that puzzle.<br /><br />In 1989, I was a graduate student discussing ST:TNG with two people who said they worked on that show. This was on FidoNet, a national bulletin board system that ran off individual people's computers, not the Internet's Usenet system.<br /><br />I was harshly critical of the show and, in particular, cut loose after they aired an episode in which Counsellor Troi's mother caught up to the starship Enterprise in a shuttle craft (early summer of 1989).<br /><br />Finally, one of them asked me \\"Well, what do YOU think we should do?\\" So I posted back that they needed to take a starship and dump it on the other side of the galaxy where there was no Federation infrastructure to support them and the crew had to struggle to survive and make their way home; no ferrying ambassadors back and forth, no parents of the bridge crew catching up to the ship in a shuttle craft, and so on. Went on for a page or so.<br /><br />I expected them to argue with me considering all the criticism I had leveled against their show (ST:TNG), and their previous defense. But instead they DISAPPEARED and I never saw them again on FidoNet.<br /><br />A few years later, ST:TNG ended and I tuned into Voyager in 1995. The ship was immediately dumped on the other side of the galaxy and I thought \\"Here's a promising idea ... hmmmm.... say,  wait a minute ... this is pretty familiar. Whoa!\\"<br /><br />  Other things that link the origin of Voyager to the FidoNet discussions with ST:TNG staff:<br /><br />  #1) In 1989, when I laid out the premise of what was to be the next series to the people who claimed to work on ST:TNG, the Voyager spacecraft flyby of the planet Neptune was major news (providing the name of show in the same time-frame as the discussion).<br /><br />  #2) The fact they stopped posting and disappeared immediately after  the new premise was suggested.<br /><br />  #3) The subsequent watered-down implementation of Voyager series. That is, they got a premise, but they didn't really \\"get it\\", as far as intent. The series could almost have occurred in the Alpha quadrant; the fact that they are alone on the other side of the galaxy didn't have the continuous impact on the story-lines you would expect.<br /><br />If the developer's had originated the idea, they would have had a better handle on the radical implications behind setting the story outside Federation space. Voyager was \\"normal\\" Star Trek with a different crew which occasionally mentions they want to get home.<br /><br />Haven't pursued acknowledgement or money, but that's the story. Do have a floppy disk from my old Amiga computer in which I saved all the messages I wrote from those years. Now if I can just recover the encryption key and get the names of the folks I was corresponding with ...
B00003OSTQ|5.0|'Network' is a really awesome and powerful film.  The strength is its screenplay, which is probably one of the best in cinema history.  But it is also carried by the crazed T.V. anchorman who has lets his real emotions loose.  Unforgettable.
1573229725|5.0|Sue Trinder is a seventeen year old girl who lives among theives in London of the mid-1800s. She is the daughter of a murderess who was hanged  a short distance from her flat. Sue lives with Mrs. Sucksby, a foster mother who raised Sue from an infant.  She also lives with some petty theives called fingersmiths or pickpockets. Into this mix wanders Gentleman, another criminal who is currently employed by an eccentric book collector in the countryside to help catalogue the works. This book collector's niece, Maud Lilly, is a naive young girl who will fall into a fortune after she gets married. Gentleman wants to seduce her and marry her. He comes to elicit the aide of Sue who he wants to become the personal maid of Maud to convince her that marriage to gentleman would be in her best interest. However, many surprises are about to befall both Sue and Maud as they get much, much more than they bargained for.<br />  Sarah Waters has written one of the most compelling mysteries I have read in years. It is epic in length, yet, the story is quite simple, always suspenseful, and, hence reads like a much shorter work. The leisurely pacing facilitating the use of strong realistic characterizations, as well as, the year the story takes place will conjure up the inevitable comparisons to Dickens. However, this is probably not fair. Few writers have ever been able to create so many well known and beloved characters as Dickens. Ms. Waters concentrates her efforts on the plot with serviceable characters.  She writes from a time almost one hundred and fifty years after the time her story takes place and what is remarkable is the fact that she has the ability to completely immerse the reader into that time period. With the extreme length, however, the story does lose its focus intermittently. However, overall, this is an excellent work and a worthy winner of the Ellis Peters Award for historical mysteries of the CWA.

B00018D44U|5.0|&quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is the awaited follow-up to the monumental multi-Grammy winning album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; (2002).  Few anticipated this album to live up to her previous.  The high quality recorded proves many people wrong.  In fact, some may say she's outdone herself.  Her remarkable musical talents that she presents prove that she'll take her career to further horizons.  Every amazing music note answers why she deserved to sell 1.02 million albums in first week sales, which is the second highest for a female artist.  Few modern-day musicians have the amazing talents as she does.  She's a true artist, which is one of her many qualities that makes her highly deserving of her fame.<br />She writes more songs on &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; than on her previous.  Arif Mardin returns to help produce this album.  However, she experiments with different genres in this album.  Though her jazzy pop vibe is still present in some tracks, she adds some country and bluegrass feel to her music.  That is mostly done by playing the wurlitzer piano rather than the grand piano.  Though her newfound musical sound is still quite mellow, she adds a more lively feel.  This keeps her music as unique as it always has been.  Such broad musical flavor prove that Norah Jones excels in other genres besides jazz and pop.  Through it all, her shy, quiet voice blends perfectly with the theme.<br />Her collaborations add new, interesting musical flavors to this album.  Her highlight duet with Dolly Parton on &quot;Creepin' In&quot; is a wonderful upbeat track that'll keep listeners dancing.  Garth Hudson (The Band), Brian Blade, and the rest also wonderfully offer their talents.  Also, her remakes live up to the original: &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; (Tom Waits) and &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; (Duke Ellington).<br />&quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a great album for the essential Norah Jones fan and/or for those looking for great music.  This is sure to please many listeners for a long time.  Fans of this album should also buy her other album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  Such combination makes for a great musical experience.
0805211063|5.0|Franz Kafka was obsessed with dreams, and THE CASTLE is his attempt to depict the modern world of corporate and governmental bureaucracy as a crazed nightmare.  The novel possesses the logic of dreams, and there is a dreamlike quality to everything that happens in the book.  As in a dream, people and situations transform effortlessly into something entirely different, as when one of the young, silly assistants of the protagonist K. suddenly appears to be a much older, decrepit man.  Though his transformation is absurd, it is part and parcel of the logic of the village dominated by The Castle.<br />I first read this novel years ago when the only option in translation was the Muir translation.  This new complete translation, which includes a large section that Kafka's friend and literary executor Max Brod decided to excise, transforms the novel into an entirely different book.  For one thing, the section that Brod left out indicates even more vividly the degree to which the novel is concerned with depicting the more horrific aspects of modern bureaucratic life.  For another, the manner in which the text simply breaks off in mid-sentence reinforces the nightmarish quality of the book, for just as we wake up from a dream, never able to complete the tale, so we break away from the narrative, never knowing what K.'s fate is.<br />The novel contains more a situation than a plot.  K., a surveyor, arrives in a village having been hired by the local Castle, presumably to survey.  Instead, K. quickly learns that he may not have been hired at all, and manages to break rapidly a number of laws of which he was utterly unaware and whose logic is far from obvious.  In this way we see Kafka exploring one of the great themes of his literature:  that all individuals are guilty until proven innocent, and that we have no idea what it means to be innocent.  K.'s plight becomes more and more absurd and confused all the way until the point at which Kafka ceased working on the novel.<br />That Kafka gave up working on the novel isn't completely surprising.  His method of writing was to growth the text like one would a plant, not necessarily knowing where the story was going, but instead allowing it to develop as it wished.  Unlike virtually every other great writer of the past two hundred years, Kafka was almost completely unconcerned with either character development or with plot.  It wasn't that he was bad at character:  it simply didn't concern him.  He was far more interested in pure situations, as if they were thought experiments.  For instance, what would happen if a man awoke one morning to find that he had been transformed into a giant beetle?  Or, what would happen if someone were accused of a crime, but knew neither accuser, the crime of which he is being accused, or where his trial was to be held?  Or, what would happen if a man showed up in a village to work as a surveyor, but discovered that he had neither a position nor means to contact those who had hired him?<br />One reading this novel should keep in mind that Kafka spent his entire professional life working as a risk manager in an insurance company.  He was acutely aware of the nature of corporate bureaucracy, and the myriad of silly rules and the amount of red tape inundating modern corporate and political life.  Some tend towards a metaphysical reading of the novel, and while the book is not immune to such a reading, I think it can be better read on a more concrete social level.  Kafka worked in an office his entire adult life, until his tuberculosis forced him to retire on what today would be workers' disability.  He knew first hand the degrading, callous, and inhuman nature of the bureaucratic culture that was threatening to engulf modern urban living.  Unfortunately, he did not, like K. in the novel, know how to escape the nightmare himself, or give us advice on how we could escape it ourselves.hat Kafka gave up working on the novel isn't completely surprising.

6305268843|5.0|This film kept me spellbound from the moment I started watching it right through to the end.Why Sophie Marceau has not been cast in many more films is beyond me.This should be an all time classic love story as I have seen none better.I still find it hard to believe that it hasn't been released on DVD.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|When I first got this album, I was ready for the dense, sprawling work described by some critics as being too ambitious and too enormous in scope for any listener to understand (narratively speaking). The first thing I played from this was the DVD, featuring Neil in a solo acoustic show, playing the album in its entirety. In between, he talks and jokes with the audience, filling in the details in between. If you watch the DVD, it gives a pretty concise summation of the whole concept and the whole story. Not at all difficult or impenetrable, there's actually a pretty simple, straightforward narrative at the heart of these songs, and it's a pretty clear expression of Neil's values and beliefs regarding family, ecology, the media, etc.<br />In the end, it wasn't the story itself so much as how it's told that made me love this album even more over time. It has the hooks, the melody, and the rhythmic flow to guide it through so that you never lose interest or attention, you just ride along with the music as Neil unfurls his characters' stream-of-consciousness musings. Even better is how Neil embodies these characters, and I think &quot;Bandit&quot; is easily the best example of this. He sings like he's talking to himself, as the character tries to talk himself out of depression and pessimism, and because it has such a low-key feel to it, it draws you in and Neil's vocal stays with you long after the song is over. A lot has been made about how ambitious the songwriting and conception is, but this is some of Neil's best and most subtle vocal performances in a long, long time, if not ever.<br />I was going to give this a four, but this album's grown so well in such a short amount of time, I really think this is something people can learn to appreciate with repeated listening.
B000069AUI|4.0|For some reason Coldplay seems to piss off a lot of people who got tired of them as the critics were hailing them as THE next great thing, first in their native UK and then is the States. Their political views also got them a bad rep as a poor man's U2, but I disagree with disliking anything due to over-praising by critics or because they have the persuasion to make some statements that people find a little didactic. Some even hate the band because the lead singer married yesterday's \\"it\\" girl, Gwyneth Paltrow. That is unfortunate because they did not ask for the hype or the surprising success of their debut release (Parachutes\\") which had melodic strength and a quiet lyrical beauty that sounds like that of a band that has been together much longer than these guys.<br />While not as initially accessible as \\"Parachutes\\", this release is probably an even better effort as it's much more varied and influenced by other great acts. The first song \\"Politk\\" already lets the listener know that it's not all about sorrow and Chris' ethereal voice. There is a definite Pink Floyd to it and it then picks up steam into actual anger, not melancholy. \\"In My Place\\" reckons back \\"Yellow\\" yet brings a little Counting Crows wail that takes the song to a different place. The accompaniment in this song is simply gorgeous and it sweeps you into its spell. I am not sure if it was released as a single, but it is really catchy. I love the guitars on \\"God Put A Smile On My Face\\" and Chris' delivery is at its best.<br /><br />&quot;The Scientist&quot; starts out with a deceptively simple piano line, yet beckons ever so softly and persuasively. It's simply beautiful and if you can try to catch the ever so subtle chorus. Some may not find Chris' voice to be that of the next \\"American Idol\\" (tongue in cheek comment), but singing is not always about belting or control and I guess that like all art, one can hate it and still be right. I happen to like his falsetto and find this band's music very optimistic when taken as a whole. \\"Clocks\\" is a work a magic and it is THE song that I could listen to over and over again. It's that good, but it does not leave you feeling bad in the morning as it's not sappy, just earnest. \\"Daylight\\" has a Hendrix-like feel at the beginning and then is carried home by a tight piano arrangement. It's not my favorite song, but it's still good. \\"Green Eyes\\" is unabashedly drunk on love and it's another of my favorites on the CD. \\"Warning Sign\\" is good and has that amazing space feel. I don't love \\"Whisper\\" as the band gets too far away from it's sound to sound a little too much like Pink Floyd. Homages are fine, but this one is a little too close for comfort.<br />I love the slow song from which this release got its title. It echoes into your brain and slowly seduces you into really listening to what the writer of the song has to say. The closer titled \\"Amsterdam\\" to me is the song that best reflects this release. All in all, this may not be considered conventional \\"rock and roll\\", yet I don't think that the band would mind being seen as musicians rather than stars. Unlike some of the next great acts as per the critics, this band does not to be suffering from the bloated egos of say Oasis, not the drug induced theatrics that ultimately destroyed the Guns N' Roses.<br />Do I think that they are the best band to grace the universe? The answer would be a absolute \\"no,\\" but is it a great young band that has avoided the dreaded sophomore jinx and I think could be around to broaden their sound and continue to grow and entertain us along the way. This release easily earns 4 stars from me. If you don't have their first release, I'd start with that and then if you like what you hear, then buy this one.

0385504209|1.0|Da Vinci isn't Leonardo's last name! It's where Leonardo was from!  In 1452 Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, near Florence.  The title of this book therefore doesn't refer to a last name, as it thinks it's doing, but refers to everyone born in Vinci.  The ignorance revealed by the title hints at what's inside, a dumb, politically correct trendy as trendy gets tale of cross dressing goddess worshipping Renaissance secret societies, etc.  The plot is worthy of a computer game.  And the idea that the Mona Lisa is a man is great fun (and kind of a tired cliche) but the historical record is clear that she was a well-known Renaissance woman who, in 1495 married the wealthy Francesco del Giocondo.  In fact, the painting for a long while was known as La Giocanda.  Only if you are completely ignorant of the history of the Renaissance, and thrilled at the notion of wicca rituals, can you enjoy this book, which is so steeped in ignorance it is hard for me to believe it got published.

B000000W9Z|4.0|This is, musically, one of the best albums i have yet heard. I LOVE the combinations of classic rock guitars mixed with industrial mixed with lounge piano and a kind of 1980's cure-style goth rock. The music is superb but there are several downsides to this album: 1. David Bowie is well known for his \\"fetish\\" for making concept albums and we consider concept albums to be this sort of ultra-extravagant & overly complex workss of high art. Bowie got the first part right but the over-all concept of this album is just cheesy and crappy. The whole Concept Album nomenclature seemed like an afterthought tacked on in an attempt to make this album into something more than it really is. 2. Come on everybody, i want to hear you all admit it, DAVID BOWIE'S LYRICS ARE MEDIOCRE. there are some phrases that are brilliant but on the whole, his lyric-writing is mediocre.. this is his Achilles' heel. He's just not on the same level as a very select few of his contemporaries like Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson and TOOL. #. The third downside-- more to do with this album itself, is that it's too long... and people tend to get bored at about track 15 (dont worry, all albums with 19 songs tend to suffer this..it's not bowie's music).<BR>Anyway, enough with the deconstructive criticism, the best song in this album, in my opinion, is \\"A small plot of land\\" followed by \\"The Motel\\" then \\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" then the intro to \\"Outside\\", \\"Thru these architects' eyes\\" and last but not least, track 15-- the first nathan adler segue..i love the 1970's porn movie sound.HEHE. \\"Wishful Beginnings\\" could have made a great track had he not added that demonic-sounding laugh. it ruined the entire song with it's cheesiness. it would have made a greater impact without it especially because of Bowie's delectably haunting vocals.. till then..(I'm not very good with endings)
0064407667|4.0|Lemony Snicket's 'The Bad Beginning' is the first book in the 'Series of Unfortunate Events' books. And it is a Bad Beginning as the Beaudilaire children are orphaned and sent to live with their greedy relative Count Olaf, who schemes to steal their inheritance. <BR>The book is written in a breezy, enjoyable conversational style that reminds one a bit of C.S. Lewis' Narnian chronicles. However the story-line has a gothic fairy-tale feel to it, with orphans battling wicked relatives, and elements of real danger and suspense. The story is short and tightly paced (perhaps a little too quick for adult readers who might wish for a little more depth) so children shouldn't find it too daunting.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|A friend of mine, after watching this movie, commented that this would be a great movie to receive the Rocky Horror treatment--meaning that the possibilities for call-back lines, character costumes, throwing things at the screen, and other rituals, are endless. This movie can and should achieve a cult following, because that is the only way it can be appreciated. You really have to have a certain sense of humor and frame of mind in order to like Party Monster. It doesn't always make sense or have a definite plot. The characters often break out of the story and start talking to the camera about the movie itself, and the parts that are supposed to be emotional often come across as contrived. These things may turn off a lot of viewers but make it more endearing to others.<br />Seth Green, as the club kid James St. James, gives what is definitely the best performance of his career. I honestly wish he could have won an Oscar for this. He has all the best lines in the movie and somehow manages to be the sane one in the picture. Macuhlay (obviously not spelled right) Culkin seems to be a terrible actor unless you keep in mind that the real Michael Alig was, in fact, monotone and nasal. Marilyn Manson gives a showstopping cameo as the hilarious drag queen Christina Superstar. If nothing else, the novelty of seeing these three parade in over-the-top club outfits is entertaining in itself.<br />So don't expect much while watching Party Monster for the first time, and I guarantee that it will only get better the more you watch it. Unless, of course, campy schlock movies don't appeal to you.
B00005KFUN|5.0|I bought this CD for the song Space Dementia, but every single song on the album is good. After many listens, I think my favorite track is &quot;Feeling Good,&quot; a tribute to the great Nina Simone.<br />I love how Muse is able to take traditionally classical musical patterns and blend them seamlessly into the sound of rock. Other people have compared them to Radiohead, though I don't quite buy that. I suppose both Muse and Radiohead, while being undeniably rock music, have musical styles that differ drastically from the patterns we've come to expect from rock. But that is where the similarity ends.<br />I highly recommend this album for any classical musicians turned rockers, or anyone looking for a good musical adrenaline rush.

Not for younger viewers.  So don't let your kids watch it unless you watch it first.  This is the second best in the series.  The third one is the best and the second one is my least favorite because it was way to gross.  Good features in this disk, all in all, this is a great buy.  I hope they bring out a box set when the third comes out onto dvd.  Oh ya, the fourth one is coming out soon.

His CD has not left my CD player since it was released.  His words are real and his soulful voice captures you.  If you haven't seen him live yet, I strongly suggest you get out to one of his concerts.  There isn't a song on the CD that I don't LOVE.  Personally, I feel Gavin isn't getting the exposure he deserves, but I guess good things come to those who wait...I'm waiting.  He is above and beyond the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;.  He is truly amazing.  If you haven't bought this CD now, GET IT!  You'll want to keep this one in your collection for years to come - because this won't be his only album!

Oh yeah...he had previously mistook her for a guy and told her off, so there is somewhat of a time factor involved, but that doesn't seem to speed things up too much for the gang.  They find themselves travelling pretty much all over Europe, getting into bad situations that include a nude beach, an anal probe, and a brother and sister make-out session.  This movie does not work enough for me to recommend seeing in the theaters.  It is about middle of the road for road trip-gross out movies.
B00006L83N|2.0|I can't help but feel that Symphony X are one of the most overrated bands around.  There is nothing here you haven't heard before and it's been done far better.  Almost all the songs here feel unfinished and there is a distinct lack of good choruses.  The choruses are big, but the band seems to lack any true melodic sensibilities.  The first track is pretty good, the second is terrible and the rest vary from poor to solid.<br />The vocals are completely cheesy and in some of the softer sections, are so sweet that Celine Dion fans would cringe.<br />I would say that The Damnation Game and Twilight In Olympus are both superior, though still far from brilliant.  This one just isn't worth the effort.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This album simply kills from start to finish!I had almost given up hope on American Metal and started mostly listening to all of the European bands(The Haunted,Soilwork,Crown,At the Gates Ect..) I was apprehensive at first but when i popped the disc in i couldnt help but to commence headbanging. Although not as technically proficient as some of the aforementioned bands these guys have ALOT of potential. If Morton and Adler had added some lengthier solos i would have been in heaven. As a unit these guys own. Overall a great effort. Two horns way up for these guys.
081541028X|5.0|This is an excellent book.  One of the best in regards to the space program and the ultimate in goals, the moon.<BR>My interests are in the Mercury through Apollo era.  This one goes through many aspects in a easy to read yet not dull form.<BR>Fact filled, humorous, humble even.  <BR>This is a must read or must own if you are a space enthusiast.<BR>Mr. Collin's other book, &quot;Liftoff&quot; is another excellent book.  It held my interest as did this one.<BR>But, that is another review.
0385510438|3.0|The book had a good, typical Grisham start however, midway through it became boring and lost the earlier developed crispness.  It would not hurt the author to seriously think about having his books reviewed by readers and not friends and specialists.  This way he would get the best suggestions.  However, the element of surprise may be lost in there.  Overall an average book which will sell well because of author's previous reputation.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Very few thrillers stand out like Martin Scorsese's &quot;Cape Fear.&quot;  It's a terrifying ride that frightens us to the very core.  It shakes you violently and paints an intense picture of revenge that is taken to a whole different level.  This is a dark and brutal film that doesn't let you off easy for a single second.<br />Attorney Sam Bowden appears to have the perfect life upon simple examination.  He has a loving wife and daughter, a very nice home, and a pretty successful and providing career.  Things take a drastic turn when Max Cady is released from prison after serving a term of fourteen years.  Cady was once represented by Bowden and is now looking for a little payback, as he feels that his former attorney didn't do everything he possibly could to keep him out of prison.  Now, Sam must realize the present danger that is before him, as not only is his life in absolute danger--but also his family and everybody else he loves and cares for.  The stakes have never been higher.<br />This is an absolutely disturbing film that pulls no punches.  It's a very uneasy movie to watch, and yet it is so well done that it is hard NOT to watch.  Robert De Niro is extremely terrifying as the vengeful &quot;Max Cady&quot; who is out and about, looking to settle the score.  This is definitely a signature role for De Niro, as this would be one of his many roles that he will be remembered for most. Nick Nolte also gives a remarkable performance that adds a human quality to his character.  The movie is well written and is perfectly executed frame by frame.  It plays like a Hitchcock film on ecstasy.  Martin Scorsese flawlessly directs this horrifying picture and knows what strings to pull to get a reaction from us.  Be warned, this is not a movie for those who have weak stomachs or faint hearts.<br />The DVD does a splendid job when it comes to doing the movie the justice that it deserves.  The picture quality is great--it is such a relief that I don't have to deal with the terrible laserdisc version that had the most horrendous picture quality.  The sound quality is also great, and you even get the chance to watch it in DTS, if your system carries it.  There are some cool extras for DVD fanatics, with extras like featurettes, deleted scenes, production notes, a theatrical trailer and more.  Surely, there will be some who will want more for a film of this caliber, but the overall presentation is more than satisfactory.<br />&quot;Cape Fear&quot; is a relentless thriller that is terrifying and suspenseful.  The movie has an excellent cast, a great script, and an extremely talented director behind it all.  Again, the movie is very intense and isn't recommended for those who have weak hearts and don't like scenes with graphic and disturbing violence.  This is definitely a classic that will always be around in the fine world of cinema. -Michael Craneterrible laserdisc version that had the most horrendous picture quality.

0385507755|5.0|Simply put, I really liked \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\" I agree with the review comparisons to \\"Nightmares Echo,\\" \\"Running With Scissors,\\" and of course \\"My Fractured Life.\\" I also would include \\"Less Than Zero\\" among the favorable comparisons. Although a fiction novel in comparison to \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" being a memoir, \\"Less Than Zero\\" deals with the same situations of poor little rich boy becoming an addict not because of life on the mean streets, but simply because he has the money to waste. In terms of impact though, it is hard to top \\"Nightmares Echo\\" or \\"Basketball Diaries.\\" Whereas, it in terms of an addictive reading experience it is hard to top \\"My Fractured Life\\" and \\"Running With Scissors\\". In all cases, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" deserving belongs among all the aforementioned. It is graphic and impacting and at the same time addictive to read. A gripping journey that will put knots in your stomach.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This is a very great record that demonstrates Diana's vocal prowess and clearly demonstrates she's more than just a pretty face. Her performance of &quot;The Look of Love&quot; really does stand out.  She also shows that she can improvise with the best of them.  Can't get enough of this CD.
0385504209|3.0|Debates on historical inaccuracies aside (after all, this is a work of FICTION), Da Vinci Code is a thrilling page turner, packed with tidbits and esotheric facts. You'll enjoy it you're a fan of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Umberto Eco's works.  That is, if you haven't read Dan Brown's earlier Angels &amp; Demons. The problem with Da Vinci Code is it's almost a rewrite of the earlier novel, it's as if Brown has a template for Langdon's adventures. The plot devices are the same: Both have a mysterious assassin tasked by a faceless villain to carry out a mission based on a historical secret. And both books feature the revelation of the villain as the least person you'd suspect (although he doesn't do a good job of throwing readers off, you'll know pages before the revelation).  Another problem is Robert Langdon's involvement in the Da Vinci Code chase. It's so forced/contrived, you can have Da Vinci Code without Langdon!  Sophie Neveu is supposed to be a crack cryptologist and she could've solved the riddles without Langdon's help, sooner or later.<br />Again, I'll say it's an enjoyable book IF YOU HAVEN'T READ Angels &amp; Demons. If you have, it's like watching a rerun.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I don't know why people compare this movie to Blade. They are nothing alike and its a heck of alot better. Besides having an incredibly attractive vampire in leather, it also has a pretty good story to it. The graphics are great and the action just keeps going. One of the things that made this movie so good was the time and craftsmanship they spent on the werewolf outfits. Its good to see some real work put into special effects rather than that cheap computer crap that hardly ever looks real. Infact, my only real disapointment was they didn't show more of the werewolves. I can't wait for the sequal.
B000002897|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard and saw the video to Screaming Tree's &quot;Nearly Lost You:, I was in a Louisville hotel fixing to start some training for a new job.  That was a wild time.  I was turning 20 and it is a wonder I am still around to tell about it.  I found this cd and got to listening to i and man I wish I had got to see them.  Grunge rock still is amazing! This cd is an essential to any person who experienced the grundge movement during the 90's.  Get it now!!!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I have heard everyone saying this soundtrack sounds too much like Peter Gabriel's cd.  I have heard Gabriel's cd and I have to say that the Passion Soundtrack blows it out of the water!!! Gabriel's cd sounds too &quot;modernized&quot; with synthesizer beats in the background!  I mean c'mon! NOTHING like Passion's soundtrack!  Passion's soundtrack is the most amazing soundtrack I have EVER heard! And even if this cd DID sound like Gabriel's (which it doesn't), so what?!?!  Get over it people!  LET IT GOOOO!
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite stands alone as the greatest debut Rock Album ever produced and possibly the greatest ever, period. Axl and the boys demonstrate the attitude that would put any punk band to shame but coupled it with song writing and musical ability that is without equal to this day. Every song is a winner and every line is great. But this album, no matter what your musical tastes you will not be sorry.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|It's unbelievable that this movie had an Oscar nomination. It has no plot and wanders aimlessly. I kept watching because I was stunned that it could be so bad and was wondering how they would pull it together at the end. When it did mercifully end, they didn't pull it together.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|In describing Lost in Translation, I can say that Bill Murray is a funny actor regardless of the setting.  I don't think many if any actors could have pulled off this role as well as he does.<br />The movie presents glimpses of two people's lives as they befriend each other during their ennui in Japan.  The development of the relationship between Bill Murray's character Bob Harris and the character played by Scareltt Johansson is enjoyable and is really lovely.<br />I enjoyed the scenes of the Tokyo nightlife.  The movie just seems to fade away in ending.  There is no defined plot or climax and the audience must decide how it ended, what the lessons are, and what the point is.<br />The movie is relaxing to watch, not too stimulating or exciting but enjoyable.<br />The bar for it was set high by the many praises in the media so it did not meet those expectations for me but I was not disappointed.  I liked the characters and that made the movie.

0679428895|1.0|I've read many books, in all genres, but I can only remember a few which made me throw the story aside half way through.  The story set up far too many scenes dealing with nudity, homosexuality, and sexual fantasy.  I thought the story was about a very entertaining aquarius and his quest to get the water running again in Pompeii.  This story was too much for me, and I would never suggest this novel to anyone.

0141439831|3.0|The reputation of Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; perseveres to this day, but I'm not sure it demands to be read in preference to many of its contemporaneous peers.  In the twenty-first century it simply fails to entertain on the level it was intended when it was written in the 1840s, and even its literary value is dubious.  The novel asks rhetorically why we are never satisfied with the things we achieve in life, and the question reverberates in a canyon of echoes as Thackeray repetitively beats the theme to death with a story that is too long and too dull.  Of course it satirizes the hypocrisy, materialism, and frivolity in the higher strata of English society, but it hardly excels in this regard when compared to so many other novels, particularly Dickens's, of the same era that do likewise with more subtlety and intelligence.  If &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; can be considered a socially valuable novel merely because it satirizes society, then nearly any novel can be considered socially valuable.      <br />Set in the 1810s and 1820s, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is basically the tale of two young women, Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp, making their respective ways through English society after leaving school.  Amelia, a virtuous girl from an affluent family, marries George Osborne, the son of a man with whom her father has a financial quarrel.  Becky, a beautiful, vivacious girl from an artistic but broken family, takes a job as a governess for a repulsive old man named Sir Pitt Crawley and eventually marries his son Rawdon.  Both husbands are British military officers who fight under the Duke of Wellington against Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo; only one comes home alive.  The novel then becomes a study in reversal, followed by a sort of restoration, of fortune -- Becky uses her charm to climb the ladder of high society while Amelia struggles to support herself and her young son.  <br />My biggest problem with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is Thackeray's general style.  His prose is serviceable but unrefined; he has a poor sense for the arrangement of detail, constructing lopsided paragraphs and dispensing useless information like complimentary mints at the door of a restaurant.  His serious characters fail to invoke sympathy and his few comical characters fail to amuse.  Perhaps it was his intention to avoid caricatures, but he can't fairly be called a realist either.  Additionally he chooses to write with the voice of a narrator whose tone is gossipy bordering on the obnoxious.  Occasionally he does offer a psychological or social insight that is interesting if not profound, but these moments seem more like digressive interjections than integral parts of the story.  <br />I know I'm being picky with this novel, but I expected better considering its permanent status in the English literary canon.  As a Victorian novelist, Thackeray cannot compete with Eliot, Hardy, Dickens, the Brontes, or even Wilkie Collins or Samuel Butler; rather, he unfortunately seems to be on the same level as Anthony Trollope, whose voluminous chronicles of the straight-laced middle class are written well but leave a bland aftertaste.  Despite its purport to be something more, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is merely a genteel, fluffy, uneventful soap opera penned by an author who attempts to be wry but instead compels his reader to wade through a Slough of Despond.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Sophia has proven herself as dismal a writer as she was an actress (and who can forget her abysmal performance in &quot;Godfather 3&quot;?)<br />It is an outrage that she was nominated for best director, particularly since Barbra Streisand had been ignored for &quot;Prince of Tides&quot;.  <br />Bill Murray did an excellent job in what was basically a mocumentary of Tokyo night life.<br />Our family tried to watch this thing on three separate occasions, hoping to find what critics saw.  Eventually, we gave up.
B000092ZYX|5.0|i neva gave enough time to radiohead, and when i decided to listen to the most recent stuff, because many of my fav. bands adore them, i knew i'd like it. but when i heard Hail to the Thief, it stole my ears! i not just liked it, i LOVED IT, it's eery, compelling, soooo melodic. the whole album carries a persistent mood, it's not depressing, it's just deep, it's art. to really appreciate this album (along with bjork) you MUST do nothing and sit and soak in the words, beats and let it envelope your mind.  it's quite astounding. and satisfying.

This includeds two CDs of pure rock n roll their are also some acoustic songs on here also. Can it get any better I dont think so! Was this review helpful?
0345440900|1.0|I have read the book and the more I learn about breastfeeding and infant sleep and development,the more obnoxious that book appears. I am not opposed to routine, I just believe that babies develop their own.<br />I do not like her anti bf attitude,she even goes so far to suggest that someday we will have genetically engineered cows to produce human milk that we can bottle feed to our babies.  As if that would be a good thing. That just makes me sick.<br />I also find it completely astounding how she suggests babies don't feel emotions like sadness or loneliness and that parents should look at the baby like they would a puppy or a kitten, when they are vocalizing they are not expressing an emotion, they are only capable of expressing a bodily need like 'I'm hungry, cold or uncomfortable.' My husband read that and said to me, &quot;It sounds like she really hates babies&quot;.<br /> Many moms nurse or rock their babies to sleep for naps and bedtime and are glad to have such a reliable tool for getting them to sleep so easily. There is no need to put a baby through the sleep training when you already have a peaceful, appropriate way to get a baby to sleep - nursing or holding.<br />As for trying to stop the baby from night waking, it is not nutritionally appropriate for young infants to attempt to eliminate any night waking during which the baby usually takes a full feed. Parents can tell when baby isn't really hungry since they will only nurse a few minutes and go back to sleep. However if they stay awake actively nursing one must assume baby is hungry and needs that feeding for the nutrition.<br />I like The No Cry Sleep Solution, it has lots of info about infant sleep that the 'baby trainers' like Hogg don't seem to know. Plus it is respectful to the needs of both parents and baby, unlike the 'Whisperer' which seems to me to try to make a baby more convenient for the parents. Yuck. You don't invite a child, a new person, into your life so you can try to make it fit in as if nothing has changed. You welcome them and embrace the changes and new experiences they bring.in as if nothing has changed. You welcome them and embrace the changes and new experiences they bring.
B0000025BL|5.0|This EPIC starts off with an instrumental opening that will sweep your feet of the vibrating floor. The motorcycle guitar at the first revs up and you can hear it REV, and it takes you for a hell of a ride! A really strong powerful voice enters after the instrumental ends.<br />The best ten seconds of ROCK N ROLL history starts the next song. With sly humour from Mr. Jim Steinman (songwriter.) No bike in this one, but the imagery is perfect with the beautiful music and vocal arrangements, the lyrics are perfect.<br />The next song, is a solo piano with a voice that goes soft, just to prove this man can sing loud and soft. Its truely a masterpiece, and is best heard live, but this is the original and sounds almost better live. Its a more toned down track, but its OK.<br />Because, the next track is just as loud as the first track, and there is a screaming saxaphone. Some brilliant music here, and some more great vocals. With a voice that remains strong as ever.<br />The next track, is more toned down, but has the guitar and the piano and the drum, a really sad song, a really liked song by listeners and non listeners of Meat. The voice truely never dies, and none of the tracks on this record has any voice  enhancements whatsoever. <br />This song, takes car sex to a whole new level. Starts with a date, with those classic guitars, although its best heard live, this is also another amazing track. Boy wants to do it, but the girl wants him to love her forever.<br />Next track, A real orchestra here, and they are playing to their fullest. Super poetic like all of the songs, and one of Meat Loaf's best, what am I saying all the tracks on this record, are one of his best. Like all tracks, super vocals super just plain super everything.<br />Don't have this record, buy it! Seven songs, but they total 46 minutes long. You shouldn't be disapointed to this record. This is one of a kind! I loved this record, why? Because I like this kind of music, and these kind of lyrics, and the voice is 1 in 1,000,000. It makes me feel gitty, and just want to rock my heart out!
1401300901|3.0|A good quick read full of likeable characters, it is none the less extremely predictable. I would recommend this book to you in paperback form. If you are looking for a more colorful characters along a similar theme, try &quot;The Magician's Assistant&quot; by Ann Patchett.
0060512806|5.0|When I ordered Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson from Amazon, I didn't look into the book too much. I had liked Snow Crash a lot, needed something to read, and heard some vague positive words about the book that I really didn't much pay attention to. So I added Cryptonomicon to my order that included Gibson's Mona Lisa Overdrive and the most recent Star Trek: Next Generation Companion. Within a handful of days a package arrived at my doorstep, and after wrestling it out of my grandmother's hands, I was able to take it to my room and open it. I couldn't imagine why they'd send me such a big box for such a small order, until I opened the box: Cryptonomicon comes in at almost 1200 pages... TWELVE HUNDRED PAGES!!! Well, if anything, I said to myself, I wouldn't have to buy a new book for a while.<br />From Pearl Harbor to the near present, Cryptonomicon tells the story of Randy Waterhouse, a present-day UNIX geek who, in the course of being roped into building a start-up with international ramifications, becomes embroiled in the results of the past: World War 2 encryption, Nazi cunning, Japanese atrocity, and stolen gold. How the past affects the present is a major theme of Cryptonomicon and we spend considerable time exploring several characters deeply entrenched in World War 2. Bobby Shaftoe is a highly decorated Marine Raider, survivor of Guadalcanal, is recruited into the mysterious Detachment 2072. Lawrence Waterhouse, Randy's grandfather, is a Navy musician, survivor of Pearl Harbor, who is discovered to be a brilliant mathematician and becomes a primary geek of the Detachment.<br />Colorful secondary characters, such as Enoch Root, the bizarre medic-priest, Günter, the crazy U-boat captain, Goto Dengo, the Japanese engineer sans faith in the war, Rudy, the gay cryptogenius recruited by the Nazis, Doug Shaftoe, Bobby's son and an ex-Marine, his daughter Amy, the object of Randy's affection when he's not wondering if she's a dyke, Ari, Randy's business partner who's obsessed with Holocausts, The Dentist, an overly rich investor with ties to the Philippine underworld, every featured member of the Secret Admirers with their guns and obsession for hacking and secrecy, richly fill out the text as we traverse the world: everywhere from Manila to Guadalcanal to London, New Guinea, Qwghlm, the Sultanate of Kimakuta, Sweden and the shores of America... an epic world-wide scope of colorful scenes of brutality and survival, discovery and redemption. A true whirlwind of breathtaking imagination.<br />Let's see if I can condense the storyline: Randy is recruited by Avi, his pen-and-paper role-playing buddy from college to build a complex international Internet start-up. Over the course of their work, a sunken U-boat is discovered off the coast of the Philippines, a location where it shouldn't be, loaded with gold. Meanwhile, the Allies are busy trying to decrypt the coded messages of the Axis, kill a bunch of the enemy and simply stay alive. Secrets become conspiracies that fuel Randy's accidental search for gold as his company struggles with lawsuits and the enormity of their business plan, coupled with Ari's obsession to prevent future holocausts.<br />I had to draw a poorly drawn and confusing map just to outline the story and characters. Fortunately, the book is not as convoluted as I am. Stephenson brilliantly takes us between present and future, the Pacific and Atlantic theatres without blinking an eye. His tale is so deftly woven that by the end, when all the pieces are brought together you can't help but be marveled by his genius. Cryptonomicon is a brilliant display of storytelling, and despite it's girth, a very fast and extremely enjoyable read that at times is outlandishly funny and outright weird set in a oft violent world of the past that is gripping and intelligent. You must read this book. Now. Thank you.<br />(The title of this article is a pathetically simple, grade-school crypto. It's so obvious it's pathetic)
B000069HK2|4.0|I can't say that I've heard a cd that is as loud and hardcore as this one yet is still so great. It has to hold some sort of personal record of mine for a cd to have so many singles that were my favorite songs when they came out. From the first time I heard \\"The Taste Of Ink\\" I loved it and considered buying the cd, but it wasn't untill \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" came out that I just had to get this. I would have to say that it was easily the best song I heard the whole year. Finally after getting the cd I discovered Blue and Yellow (the new single at the time), a masterpiece of a song. Still this cd is not one where only the singles are good, some of the best stuff has yet to be played on the radio. Songs like Poetic Tragedy, Pieces Mended, Noise And Kisses and On My Own are wonderful and help to put this cd in constant rotation on my cd player. To sum up this cd it's a surprising yet excellent experience. While filled with a couple over the top screamers that I would only recomend to fans of the style it still manages to base itself in a deeply melodic form of the screamo/punk/whatever you want to call it genre that makes this great for any fan of rock music. If you can't tell yet I loved this cd.
0380789019|4.0|You know, I wanted to like this book. Everyone seems to believe that Neil Gaiman is the next Clive Barker. But I have to disagree. I have been trying to read this book for over 3 years, and I just keep getting bored. Why?<br />I don't know. The premise is good; the characters are well-developed and the story definitely has \\"that\\" atmosphere I always love in \\"Wonderland-type tales.\\" But for some reason, when I finally finished it, I thought, \\"Hmmm, what's all the fuss about?\\"<br />It's well-crafted and very dark (which I like), but it doesn't have that something extra that makes one want everyone they know to read the book.<br />AFTER READING \\"NEVERWHERE\\" A SECOND TIME, I LIKED IT BETTER AND RAISED MY OVERALL RATING FROM 3 TO 4 STARS. STILL, SOMETHING FEELS LIKE IT'S MISSING SOMEWHERE.
0345403959|5.0|I own all the books from the Belgariad and Mallorean series + Polgara and the Rivan Codex and this books fits perfectly with the entire collection.<br />The book follows the life of Belgarath and how he became the legend he is, from the time he was born in the village of Gara, to the meeting with Aldur, cracking of the world...and so on. There may be some slight inconsistencies....but it was deliberate because Belgarath is telling the story from HIS point of view and how things really happen. Some folks maybe disapointed about how certain events are actually duller than what was learned from the two previous series. But thats the idea! Legends are always exaggerated and when the truth is told, people are upset.<br />The interesting thing about the story is that Belgarath tried his best to keep the story down to earth as possible. Instead of the usual mystical mumbo jumbo, everything is laid out as if your own buddy was telling you the story.<br />Overall, I think its a great read and will answer a lot of unanswered questions from the two series.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has always been able to reinvent herself. She started out with teeny-bopper pop on \\"Baby, One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I did it again,\\" and moved to a hip hop beat on the self titled \\"Britney.\\" But now, Britney has proven herslef to be the diva of dance. \\"In the Zone\\" is dance...plain and simple. If you don't like dance, this album is not for you. \\"In the Zone\\" is loaded with catchy tunes, infectious beats, and spectacular lyrics, all of which will make one want to get up and shake what their momma' gave 'em. I really mean this. For instance, \\"Breathe on Me\\" (my personal favorite) has an intoxicating club beat (reminiscent of something you might hear in a strip club) and an erotic main verse that pushes you to whip your hips with the song. And who could forget \\"Toxic,\\" Britney's second single...enough said. Ms. Spears definately turns up the sexual heat on this album, however. \\"Touch of my Hand\\" and \\"Early Mornin'\\" are enough to support this statement. She's grown up, and \\"In the Zone\\" is the perfect way for Britney to trade in the good girl image for a hot 'n sexy, unafraid and unstoppable one instead. Aside form the dance, there are also heartfelt ballads, such \\"Everytime,\\" a track that some say is an answer to Justin Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River.\\" This album also has a lot of famous names on it. Madonna on \\"Me Against the Music,\\" - there is even an 80s Madonna feel on the upbeat song \\"Brave New Girl\\" - The Ying Yang Twins on \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\")-one you will definately shake it like a salt shaker to - Moby's lyrics on \\"Early Mornin\\" (probably the least effective track), and a taste of Mr. R. Kelly himself on \\"Outrageous,\\" a hot song with a middle eastern bump bump background. A new groove, a bit more sex, and a good dose of collaboration all contribute to making the latest album from Britney Spears spectacular, and it's one that the club-hoppers will love...are you ready to experience the new Britney?

I had, of course, been hearing White Flag on the radio for weeks, and it had taken a while to grow on me, but I thought I'd try the album anyway.<BR>1. White Flag - Although it has been adored all over the world, White Flag really isn't the best track on the album. Musically and emotionally beautiful, it is an easily accessible track, with a mix of sweeping orchestral sound and respectful silence for Dido's simple voice.<br />2. Stoned - Not a mainstream pop song like White Flag, Stoned starts with a full minute of instrumentals. Starting with &quot;When you're stoned, baby/And I am drunk/And we make love it seems a little desolate&quot;, this song at first seems rather confusing. But once it gains momentum (with a beautiful chorus), Stoned comes through as a great track.<br />3. Life For Rent - The second single, this is one of my least favourite tracks. It's very pretty, and symbolises Dido's plans for the future, but the chorus somehow seems too &quot;sing-along-ish&quot; for my taste.<br />4. Mary's In India - A simple, pretty melody, but intriguing lyrics, Mary's In India talks of Dido's friend Mary who leaves to India and doesn't call boyfriend Danny when she'd said she would. Eventually Danny finds comfort in Dido's arms. Naughty...<br />5. See You When You're 40 - Maybe the song I've least warmed to. This is partly because of a review I read where an immature critic said Dido made the line sound like &quot;See you when you're farty.&quot;<br />6. Don't Leave Home - The planned third single (should have been second), this is a fantastic track the chorus of which is a beautiful plea to a lover Dido is clearly addicted to. &quot;I will be your safety/Oh, don't leave home&quot;.<br />7. Who Makes You Feel - A rather difficult track slyly persuades a partner in a dying relationship not to leave, for, as Dido points out &quot;Whomakes you feel the way that I make you feel?&quot;<br />8. Sand In My Shoes - The first song I fell in love with on the album, this must be the fourth single! It could be a great summer hit, as it tells of a holiday romance Dido failed to hold on to.<br />9. Do You Have a Little Time - Similar to Who Makes You Feel, this track berates an absent lover, asking &quot;Why do you still run when you could walk with me?&quot;.<br />10. This Land Is Mine - Similar to Life For Rent in that the chorus is an irresistible clap-along song, This Land Is Mine is a grudging concession to love, as a defensive Dido reminds her partner that &quot;this land is mine&quot;.<br />11. See The Sun - See The Sun is the only track on the album Dido wrote on her own, and it's beautiful. A friend is mourning for a lost loved one, and Dido comes and pulls him out of bed to walk with her<br />*See The Sun contains a hidden track, seperated by 2 minutes of silence* <br />11 b. Closer - This track comes as a shock when your stereo has stopped playing for minutes, and suddenly the gentle guitar chords of Closer start, and Dido teasingly flirts with a man, telling him she is happier the closer he gets, but he needn't rush it, as she'll always be around.<br />In short, Life For Rent is a wonderful album. Different in subtle ways to No Angel, there is far more to the album than the radio suggests!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album, like countless others before me have already told you, is a mind-bending experience, one not to be forgotten any time soon. Yes, the first time you listen to it, you might not like it. Yes, it's a deviation of their previous albums. Yes, it's overrated.<br />Yeah, I'm sorry, but this CD is overrated. And it's NOT innovative...there are other bands that have done work like this before, but they've never been introduced to nearly as much commercial success as Radiohead.<br />People LOVE to feel intellectual when discussing this CD, especially when people say how genius the lyrics are...I mean, sure, half of the songs were written to be stand-alone lyrically (How To Disappear Completely, Optimistic, Idioteque, and Motion Picture Soundtrack come to mind...) but the other half have already been admitted to being nifty little one-liners pulled out of a hat. That doesn't mean the lyrics aren't important, just that they weren't meant to be such a deep experience. They're supposed to be nifty little phrases to ponder as you listen to the tone and inflection of the voice, not some fantastic voyage. The CD isn't leaps and bounds above everything when it comes to philosophical panderings, but it IS leaps and bounds ahead of other albums in other areas...<br />I'm only two paragraphs in and I'm already bashing my favorite CD. Listen, people, this CD isn't any intellectually deeper than other CDs, and it's not 'misunderstood'. But it is a fantastic musical adventure that shouldn't be taken lightly.<br />The songs were extremely well crafted, no matter what the haters will have you believe. Every time I listen to this CD, I notice something new. And I've listened more times than I can count. Why are people always saying this CD is distant and cold?! I see the word &quot;depressing&quot; in most of these reviews. I don't know about you guys, but I happen to get a great vibe from the majority of this album, namely the first two tracks, Optimistic (regardless of the lyrics), and Morning Bell...wait, come to think of it, that's not really a majority. Who cares, the CD rules anyway.<br />How can anyone possibly find Treefingers relaxing?! I get a serious sense of doom from that song...<br />I'm not even sure I've been trying to convey a cohesive point throughout this review. I can honestly say that this is my favorite Radiohead release, and probably my favorite CD of all time. It strikes chords in me that no other CD can. It has a musical sensibility and flow that never gets old. A great 50:01 long blob of music (although that doesn't really count, seeing as 4 minutes of it are taken up by silence. The first silence is useful...the second one is not. Makes me wonder if they just added it in to get that great number).<br />You don't need to know this could be considered a concept album to fully appreciate it, either. I didn't hear anything like that until months after I fell in love with this album. The music is enough in and of itself, and holds a special, personal quality that's hard to find anywhere else. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who hasn't already heard it, and wants to add some more depth (not to mention width and volume) to your music library. If you don't like it, you don't like it. You're not a bad person, you're not shallow, and you're not taking the music at face value. You have a different opinion than me, and I have to respect that. What makes mine better than yours?
0792153294|5.0|I have both Deep Impact and Armageddon. Deep Impact is far better of the two. Both are about doomsday-rocks heading for the planet Earth. Deep Impact gives us the human-side of the equation in very believeable subplots of families, friends, colleagues, even the US President. It has a top-notch cast of highly famous actors, as well as little- to well-known players. I found it very touching, exciting, scarey, everything. I saw a documentary about \\"Doomsday Rocks\\" (true title uncertain). It made many-a-mention of Deep Impact. How it finally gave the politicans a heads-up to finance various programmes to try to prevent rogue asteroids and/or comets from hitting Earth. Armageddon was tokenly acknowledged. This is how powerful such a movie as Deep Impact can make an impression (pun may be included). A new notation of how this film made an impression with NASA: They launched an un-manned rocket to intercept a comet in our solar system, in the 2nd week of January 2005. It's name is \\"Deep Impact\\". So, to the fans: it works for the powers-that-be. I found myself laughing, crying, bitting my nails - as it were. Deep Impact hits the heart, mind, and soul. I highly recommend it. The cast consists of Robert Duvall, Morgan Freedman, Tea Leone, Maximillian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, Elijah Wood, LeeLee Sobieski, Denise Crosby, etc.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|This movie was a perfect ending to a Trilogy. Even though most sequels do better than the original, this one was just right. It answered all the questions you were wondering from the first two, and even though the ending is not what I expected it was perfect. Others viewers who watched this and said it sucked, they were expecting other things than what the movie was actually suppose to tell. It told a great story and ended with all answers to questions some people might have had. I gave it 4 stars because it could have kept going and finished a little more better, but all in all good ending to a great trilogy.

0767840135|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Quidam in its first American run, with the original performers and routines.  I can say without hesitation that this DVD captures the beauty, and compelling aura, of the live performance - no easy feat.  And in regards to the show itself, I feel strongly that it is the best Cirque du Soleil has ever offered.<br />With a message of innocence rediscovered in a world of jaded ennui, this show opens the viewers' eyes to seeing life in a new light.  Personally, I felt completely renewed after watching, and still feel the magic, thanks to the DVD.  Each time I view it, I walk away renewed, and encouraged.<br />There is not a weak act in the bunch, and several are utterly astounding - the hand-balancing stands out for its technical strength, and the contortion in silk is hauntingly beautiful.  Sadly, the easy flow of the German wheel is somewhat lost in the DVD - in live performance, it was one of the best acts in the show.  The clowns are as appealingly bizarre as ever.  However, the real credit must go to John Gilkey, whose gangly-graceful character captures the heart.  He leads the entire show with ease, guiding the production from one act to another...and his solo performances are works of art.  His contribution alone makes the DVD worth owning.<br />A last mention that makes the DVD worthwhile is that it includes music from the show that isn't included on the CD - why these pieces were left out I'll never understand.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I had heard a review of Josh Groban's music on the radio and that he had a concert in Portland, Maine.  On impulse, I bought his CD.  I have played it over and over again. Josh Groban has an incredible voice. I am usually into rock and roll. When I listened to this CD I thought it was the most romantic music I have ever heard.  Josh Groban has an irresitible sound to him. I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates a beautiful voice, unbelievable lyrics, and overall talent in the production. This a great CD, no matter what type of music you usually like. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who listens to music!!! Luci
B0000640SA|2.0|The film begins with Lenny shooting the man (or we're so led to believe) who he thinks raped and murdered his wife. The film then moves backwards in time because it wants the viewer to feel what it's like having short term memory loss just like Lenny, the main character. I admire the creativity, but it gets tedious. I almost lost all interest in the movie until Natalie provides a twist to the story. Then the end of the movie comes, which is actually the beginning of the story and the viewer discovers the truth: this movie was pointless to begin with!
B00005JMNA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It is so much better than the first, everything about it just worked perfectly. The other things going on in addition to the dancing made it so much more interesting. This is my new favorite movie. I'm buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD!
B000059R8Y|5.0|Eric Clapton shows signs of slowing down rocking on this album. Many of the songs are either soul or blues. The Impressions,an R&amp;B group once led by the late Curtis Mayfield,sang background vocals on most of the songs on this album. This album opens with the title track,written by Clapton. BELIEVE IN LIFE was a hit. Clapton covers DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT written and originally recorded by James Taylor. Stevie Wonder's I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT sounds really cool. COME BACK BABY was written by the legendary Ray Charles. All the other songs are cool. This album is packed with photos taken between the 1940's and 1970's. Clapton's liner notes explain the meaning of the title track.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the show from the very beginning.  And from the very beginning I fell in love with it and the characters.  What a great concept.. sci-fi with a western twang!  And the music just the music alone is captivating!  Ron Glass said something to the effect that he hopes there comes a day when he won't cry when thinking about Firefly.  Gotta admit I feel the same. <P>FOX network was VERY short sighted on this and I hope that they now understand how wrong they were to pull out all the stops to assure this wonderful shows failure.<P>The cast was/is amazing they brought the characters to life, and I mean &quot;real&quot; life they weren't perfect but human.  After watching all the episodes on the DVD collection you are hooked and it's a good thing!
B000002MFE|4.0|UNPLUGGED is a sequel to JUST ONE NIGHT released in 1980. There are no electric guitars in this concert. Eric Clapton,I believe,was not promoting a new album when recording this one. This is a follow-up to 1989's JOURNEYMAN. Cable television's MTV,back in 1992 began its Unplugged series of concerts performed by various artists. This was one of those concerts. There's also a video version of this album. Clapton begins with his personal composition,SIGNE,which is instrumental. BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME,a JOURNEYMAN track,is very subtle of course. It's doesn't sound much like the original version. TEARS IN HEAVEN is a tribute to his toddler son Conor who died of injuries from a high window fall. LAYLA became a hit again. The original version was recorded in 1970 by his former band,Derek And The Dominoes. Other JOURNEYMAN tracks are RUNNING ON FAITH and OLD LOVE. All the other songs are good. RUNNING ON FAITH and LAYLA were reused on 1999's CLAPTON CHRONICLES.
0375703764|5.0|It is interesting that the experience of reading &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is very much like the book itself... if you're daring enough to venture into it, you're going to find it very very hard to get out.<br />Danielewski is a wordsmith, a master of convincing the reader to forget that they're actually reading a novel. While the footnotes, if you're not careful, can get distracting, the truth is that the story of both Johnny Truant and even moreso of The Navidson Record are so deeply compelling that once you pick this book up, you'll hardly be able to put it down.<br />It took me three weeks to get past the first 100 pages and 8 hours to finish the rest of the book. If you let it suck you in, you'll never regret it.
B000002LJW|5.0|JOURNEYMAN is the follow-up to 1986's AUGUST. As the 1980's neared the end,PRETENDING was on hit parade and played on rock stations worldwide. This album was released in the fall of 1989. Guest artists include Phil Collins and the late great George Harrison. Harrison wrote RUN SO FAR and sang background vocals. Other great tracks are NO ALIBIS and other hits BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME,BAD LOVE and RUNNING ON FAITH. HARD TIMES is bluesy. In fact that style of music influenced Eric Clapton. OLD LOVE,along with RUNNING ON FAITH and BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME have been used for the live follow-up UNPLUGGED. HOUND DOG has slightly different lyrics. It doesn't sound like the version recorded by the late great Elvis Presley. All the other songs are good. Hey,I love the lyric,&quot;You say I'm spending my money on other women and taking money from someone else.&quot;!
B00009L1OB|4.0|You know, throughout the eighties I was a guitarist into all of the so called &quot;hair bands&quot; of the time such as Motley Crue, Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Ozzy, Sabbath etc. My circle of friends, also musicians, were of like tastes and would shun the likes of a Duran Duran.At leat publicly they would.I say that simply because I loved these guys but would never have admitted doing so at the time.<BR>What does that have to do with respect to Duran Duran or this album in particular?<BR>Good question with a very simple answer.<BR>Its all about the songwriting not the sound and or style.<BR>My personal preferance with respect to style and sound is constantly changing.But a good song is a good song no matter how it is presented.<BR>That being said, this album is full of good songs.<BR>It's as simple as that.
B0000024UO|5.0|I have loved this album for thirty five years.  When it came out in 1969 it really made a splash - people brought it to school to be seen carrying it, it was that kind of album.  I play guitar, and it was THIS album that taught me how to play/improvise electric blues solos.  Previously, we high school guitarists would learn a hit song, and would be all we had - one new song under our belts.  But with this album, if you learned two songs, you couldn't help but learn how to play blues in general, and if you learned three or four songs, you were dominant.  People would wonder how you did it - how you could extemporize cool solos.<br />Johnny had a unique guitar tone, which unlike Clapton, Hendrix, and Leslie West, few were able to copy.  The good news is that it sounds as good as the other (now cliched) blues tones, and if you can deliver it, it will set you apart from the  Stevie/Eric/Hendrix wannabees. Here's how to do it - use a Fender Mustang, Duo-Sonic or MusicMaster guitar (they all have the same type of pickup) and play solos using the RHYTHM pickup, but EQ your amp for a trebly setting.  The result will be more of a bluesy &quot;clang&quot; sound rather than the ubiquitous Marshall &quot;roar&quot; than become prevalent.  On subsequent albums, Johnny switched to Gibson Firebirds, but still played through the rhythm pickup through a trebly EQ.  Try the Fenders though - it's more of a classic blues sound, and great for slide.<br />For improving one's chops and taste, you couldn't do better than to buy this CD and learn &quot;Be Careful with a Fool&quot; and &quot;Leland Mississippi Blues&quot;, and maybe use &quot;Amazing Slow Downer&quot;, [...] to get all those notes.<br />Buena suerte.
B00000AFHM|5.0|This is a superior album.  Isobel's singing on \\"Is It Wicked To Care?\\" is really good, very simplistic and meaningful (\\"rusting armor for effect...\\").  By far, the best song on the album is \\"Ease Your Feet Into The Sea.\\"   I listen to an extremely varied mix of music and find this one song to be one of the very best I've heard in the last 10 years or so.  The arrangement is tight and there isn't a lot of extraneous music clouding the sound of the acoustic guitar.    I love the sound of the fingers moving across the strings during the song's solo, too.<BR>CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM AT THE WARFIELD ON 4/30!!!!
B000002UEB|5.0|You know its good when the wife tells you to &quot;Turn it down!&quot;<BR>Rock N Roll at its best!
B0001CCXY8|5.0|To some extent I'm a death metal snob. I love the super technical bands like Nile, Spawn of Possession, Deeds of Flesh, Monstrosity, and Decapitated. But you know what? Cannibal Corpse truly is as good as any band playing death metal today. First of all, they're more diverse than 95% of the bands out there. As with any of the last several Corpse CDs, you'll get a mix of brutal riffs, doom-laden groove, catchy mosh, impressive technicality, wild soloing, and blistering thrash. And the band always knows when to change gears at just the right time. Throw in the ultra-sick cover art, gore-drenched lyrics, and top-notch production, and what you end up with really is one of the most entertaining and quality packages in metal today. <br />In other words, don't listen to the snobs. The Wretched Spawn is my favorite Corpse album in years. Perhaps even better than Bloodthirst (high praise!). And I recommend it to any metal fan that enjoys a thick slab of gory death metal in their musical diet from time to time.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The problem with this movie is not the acting, or the location, it's the story.  It's just too shallow, which makes the statue they threw at Sophia such an outrageous gift.  While a number of intriguing situations are presented, from forays into the nightlife of Tokyo to one-night stands with lounge singers, nothing is ever really examined.  This plays like a first-year film school project, and a &quot;C&quot; effort at that.  Others have also pointed out the near-racist stereotyping of the Japanese culture.  I lived in Japan for almost five years and, while you can see everything Sophia shows in this movie, what is the point?  Why am I watching Scarlett take Bill to a strip joint and spend two minutes there doing nothing?   What does she make of her husband's intensity in his work or the company he keeps, given how rudderless she is in her life?  The lounge singer episode is seen through the eyes of a child, and the director quickly dissipates any tension almost as if in denial.  So, she had a good cast and an interesting location to create the bonding situation for her characters.  But she fails to successfully explore the complexities and the internal conflicts of these two ridiculously blessed people who have no idea what to do with their affluent lives.  Coppola cops out.  Frankly, I just came away thinking she's not old enough yet to really confront the issues she is becoming aware of.  She should have tried making this movie in her forties.  Maybe she'll get a chance to do that.  In the meantime, I gave away my copy of the DVD.
B000002U9E|5.0|Being a product of the '80s, well technically the '70s however I don't remember that decade as well as the '80s, one of my personal favorite songs has always been Kate Bush's &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot;. I always thought that Kate Bush had one of the most unique voices in music. I have to admit that I only own one Kate Bush cd and that is &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. I recently dug the cd out of my mountain of mostly useless cds that I stash in my closet. I decided to play the cd and I soon found myself falling in love with &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; all over again. I am no expert on Kate Bush or her music as a lot of reviewers appear to be here so I am going to have to review on what I heard. I think it is a given to say that without Kate Bush, there would have been no Tori Amos. The similiarities are obvious, especially to Tori fans (such as myself). As I said earlier, Kate has a unique voice as does Tori. Both women are constantly changing the octaves in their voices as they sing. The oblique, if not abstract lyrics are seen in both women's songs. In regards to &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, I found myself enjoying the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; side slightly more of than &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;. I find myself more drawn to songs like &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. Nevertheless, all the songs are wonderful. Kate Bush has a real knack for songwriting. I just don't see or hear enough artists like Kate nowadays. Artists like Kate Bush comes once in a blue moon. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is an incredible piece of pop music and certainly deserves a remaster treatment like The Cocteau Twins' catalog were given.
B000002KZ6|5.0|My memories of Friday nights when I was in high school center around two things: playing in the band at football games and watching late night TV while eating a much-delayed dinner afterwards. In the early part of the 1980s, the show that I tuned in was Wolfman Jack's Midnight Special, where I was first exposed to the music video form, since we lived outside of town and didn't have MTV. I recall seeing Nick Lowe's &quot;Cruel to Be Kind,&quot; Elvis Costello's &quot;Accidents Will Happen,&quot; Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody,&quot; Alice Cooper's &quot;How You Gonna See Me Now,&quot; and Talking Heads' &quot;Burning Down the House.&quot; These songs were staples of rock radio, even if the artists weren't, and the video portion did exactly what it was supposed to: increase my interest in the artist.<br />I didn't buy Speaking in Tongues until 1985, when most others had already moved on to other, newer, albums. But I was commuting back-and-forth between my home in Gatesville and community college in Killeen, a trip of roughly 40 minutes, and my soundtrack for that commute quickly became this album by Talking Heads which I had found in a used cassette store outside the local army base, Ft. Hood.<br />Why this album? A combination of circumstances surrounded it, making it appropos of the moment. I was living at home and attending Central Texas College because I had flunked out of the University of Texas at Austin, and the white-guy funk of David Byrne somehow matched the awkwardness of my situation, while being bouncy enough to keep my spirits up on that depressing commute, taking my mind off my failure and uncertain future. The fact that the lyrics of this album are an associative mass rather than a logical series allowed me to connect every song to my personal situation.<br />I can recall as if it were yesterday putting the steering wheel of a Ford Escort in my hands, bouncing in my seat as I sing-a-long with Byrne. From the gospelish chorus of &quot;Swamp&quot; to the infectious beat and call-and-response of &quot;Slippery People,&quot; I would join in on each song, probably surprising a number of the pickups that passed me by with my spasmodic renditions of Bryne's stage moves.<br />And then there's that last song, a paeon to the comfort of home. Byrne sings, &quot;Home is where I want to be, but I guess I'm already there&quot; perfectly captured my confusion of appreciating that I had this generous spot to fall-back on while at the same time wanting to be somewhere else (a home of my own, not one made by my parents). The song always seemed to be playing as I drove up the hill to the house, too. It, and the other songs on this album, never fail to take me back to that time, even now that I've moved far from that home. But then, isn't that one of the functions of music?the infectious beat and call-and-response of &quot;Slippery People,&quot; I would join in on each song, probably surprising a number of the pickups that passed me by with my spasmodic renditions of Bryne's stage moves. <br />And then there's that last song, a paeon to the comfort of home.

B00003CX9E|5.0|All I ever heard from adults was how great Citizen Kane was.  Well to fulfill a class requirement in my college movies class, we watched Citizen Kane and I have to admit, it is right up there in my list of great movies.  It is an old story but its a great story.  Orson Welles really out did himself.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I cancelled my order after reading these reviews. I agree that the price should be lower if it is only 8 episodes. I didn't really realize that this was the case , until I read the reviews. I'll wait for the entire season 6 to become available.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are funny and witty and they keep you involved in the story.  Not what I expected from Alfred Hitchcock, but it was a great movie none the less.

B0000AM6LY|4.0|I heard &quot;Sunrise&quot; on the radio about 3 weeks ago and was shocked to hear that it was Simply Red!  I bought the &quot;Home&quot; cd the very next day and I haven't been able to stop playing it.  This is my first Simply Red cd but it won't be my last
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The movie is a simplistic one that in some parts is a little slow. The outcome in the end is that you feel for the characters, you feel their lonliness and this is what makes the movie good. Murray and Johansson are excellent (as always) and it's worth seeing just for Murray's comedic performance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am - without a doubt - very picky about what I like and what I don't like.  When I first saw a few episodes of Firefly on FOX during it's brief television run, I didn't like the show much at all.  Toss it up to a dash of stupidity one my part and a large helping of it on the part of the FOX network.  By not airing the pilot they threw the audience in head first without directions.  Without that pilot, which was the key to all the marks on the map that was Firefly, no one had a clue what was going on.  Only a few intelligent people who saw passed the confusion and to the heart of the show became fans.  Somehow though, Firefly's become the new Star Trek - a little known cancelled show that grew (and is growing) into so much more through the support of it's fans post-cancellation.  It was another fan who dared me to watch the pilot and see what I thought that got be to become a Firefly fan.  Consider this your dare.  Firefly is without a doubt a fantastic show, and soon to be feature film entitlted Serenity - the name of the ship, and the title of the un-aired pilot.<br />The DVD set is exceptional.  I have DVD sets for a few TV shows and rarely do you get such excellent bonus features - even though those shows where multiple-seasons long and poor Firefly only got half a season.  I guarentee you'll love Firefly.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Love the PYNC live...but I am posting for the person who wanted to know who performs &quot;Flowers Bloom.&quot; That song is by an incredible band called Mandalay.  They released two albums in the UK, numerous singles, and a US album featuring tracks from both of their UK releases called &quot;Solace.'   Sadly, the band broke up last year and the lead singer, Nicola Hitchcock, is now moving on with solo projects.  She has her own website too.  I love Mandalay, and though they are compared to Portishead, I think they are very unique in their own way.
6303282237|5.0|I too am saddened by the fact that this marvelous film is still unavailable on DVD.  I immediately bought the VHS version when it first came out for almost $100 way back when and, boy, am I glad I did!  I have enjoyed it for years and years!  It is also starting to wear out; thus began the search for a DVD of this terrific movie.  Sigh...  Maybe someday soon someone will give it the attention it deserves and finally put something, anything together for us who know it for the wonderful film that it is.  With Charlton Heston and Sofia Loren, how can one go wrong?  Help us, dvd production land, you're our only hope!
0393325172|3.0|I found this book interesting but difficult to read. The narrative is choppy, jumping from place to place, and Mr. O'Brian ends scenes abruptly. It takes quite awhile to get a feel for the characters. The nautical terms made some passages almost unreadable for me. Over all I enjoyed it but would not recommend it for the casual reader.
0425098478|5.0|The book demonstrates three easy to use management techniques: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praising, and One Minute Reprimands. One Minute Goal Setting involves setting clear performance standards and expectations. According to the authors, most managers use NIHYSOB or \\"Now I have you - you SOB\\" These managers don't tell people what they expect of them; they just leave them alone and then \\"zap\\" them when they don't perform at the desired level. In One Minute Goal Setting the manager and employee agree on goals or key areas of responsibilities so that the employee knows what they will be accountable for and what performance is expected. The manager and employee agree that the manager will let the employee know when they are performing well and when they are not. <br />After One Minute Goal setting the manager stays in close contact with the employee and gives them a One Minute Praising when they do something right. The most important thing in training someone is to catch them doing something right-in the beginning it may be approximately right and gradually move them towards the desired behaviors. Praise employees for what they do right and encourage them to repeat the behavior. That's why it's important to observe new people in the beginning or when starting a new project. The praise should come immediately after you see them do something right and not just at performance review times. <br />If the employee is not performing as agreed on in the One Minute Goal Setting then the manger may use One Minute Reprimands. The authors state that most managers are \\"gunnysack discipliners.\\" That is, they store up observations of poor performance and then at performance review time or when they are angry they \\"open the sack.\\" They tell people all the things they've done wrong for the last weeks or months. The idea behind One Minute Reprimands is that the manager should intervene early and deal with the problem at the time that it happens and not wait till the performance review time. Reprimands should be fair and should focus on behavior and not on the worth of the person. The reprimand should always be followed by a praising -- telling the person what they are doing right and how much they are valued. <br />Although this book was written over 20 years ago the advice given by Blanchard and Johnson still holds true today. I can personally identify with what they refer to as NIHYSOB and \\"gunny sack\\" managers. I work in an organization where managers are hired strictly on the bases of their subject matter expertise and not because of their management or interpersonal skills. This means most employees are left on their own to figure out what they are supposed to be doing on the job.  Feedback on what you're doing right or wrong is rarely given. The annual performance feedback is considered a \\"joke\\" because most managers give every employee an outstanding evaluation in order to avoid conflict. As one can imagine this doesn't create the most motivating work environment.  <br />In summary the One Minute Manager states that managers should: 1) set one minute goals with people to make sure they know what are being held accountable for and what performance is expected, 2) try to catch them doing something good and give them immediately praise, and 3) if they have the skills to do something right and they don't; them reprimand them.
0783235968|5.0|I'm always amazed when I hear baseball fans complain about this movie, and believe me it happens every spring.  Good sports movies are few and far between, and I'd stick Field Of Dreams out at the front of the pack along with Bull Durham and Hoosiers, (with the slight overall edge to Hoosiers.)  The Field Of Dreams story has been rehashed often enough in these reviews, so I'll spare you my take on it, but I have to say that the cast is what takes a pretty good story and makes it into a great movie.  Only Costner's Dances With Wolves performance tops this one.  James Earl Jones is likewise incredible as the sixties burn-out, as is Amy Madigan as the hippy burn-out.  Honestly there isn't a weak performance in the movie, and if the Fenway Park scenes don't make you book a trip to Boston, you shouldn't call yourself a baseball fan.

B00011RPB0|5.0|I saw this movie in Marseille in a cinema showing foreign films, and because I didn't speak a single word of French, I could just totally understand what Bob Harris was going through. <br />Frankly, the unbelievable lips of Scarlett Johannsen are reason enough to see the movie.<br />I saw another review saying that the movie shows signs of racism against Japanese people, indicating that they are short and that they don't speak English well. Well, they don't, and they are short, so this is not racism, but just amusing.<br />The mood of the movie is very consistent, some people might say depressing, I would say layed back and inspired by the ability of the actors, especially Bill Murray, to show emberassment, amusement and astonishment about themselves. They are not sure how they got to this point in their lives, and they are even less sure if they like it there. <br />My resumé: a movie that leaves you with more hope than you had before.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a concert that will absolutely break your heart and move you if you love George Harrison or the Beatles.  It is lovingly produced, beautifully photographed and as emotional as anything I have ever seen relating to any of the Beatles. I've watched it four times and still am not weary of it, and I doubt any of you will be.<br />There are so many wonderfully poignant images: how about George's son, Dhani, who looks so much like George it's eerie; he moves likle George, strums his guitar like his father and has that goofy, infectious grin that was so much as part of Harrison. When McCartney is singing &quot;For You Blue&quot; and Dhani is directly behind him, I guarantee you will do a double take. Dhani''s interviews also show his charm and humor.<br />Clapton is magnificent and understated. He plays lead guitar only once throughout the entire concert, and that is appropriately on &quot;White My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot; He sings lead on a few Beatles tracks, but lays back most of the concert, careful not to overshadow the moment or the memory. Jeff Lynne also does a fine job. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers sing &quot;Taxman&quot; and &quot;I Need You,&quot; but one wishes Eric would have taken over both those songs.<br />The applause when Ringo appears is deafening and the infectious way he sings &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;Honey Don't&quot; will have you clapping your hands and smiling all over. It must be impossible not to adore Ringo. The Python &quot;Lumberjack&quot; skit includes a surprise appearence by (of all people) Tom Hanks.<br />And what about Paul? He took so much needless criticism for his appearence here. Many discussions and reviewers claimed he was petulant that Clapton overshadowed him, that his applause wasn't as loud as Ringo's and countless other nit-pickings. I've watched Paul all my life and rarely have I seen him as moved, teary-eyed and emotional as he was this evening. He packed his ego away and did George and the fans proud. Watch Paul as he strums the ukelele while singing &quot;Something.&quot; It's obvious he is struggling not to break down and cry. Clapton later said &quot;Paul was never close to George,&quot; but Eric is wrong. From 1957-1967 they were very close and Paul knows this. The scenes with Paul are my favorites, he acquits himself beautifully.<br />While no fan of Ravi's music, even this Indian segments are moving and move along at a rapid clip. Another highlight is Billy Preston belting out the second chorus of one of George's masterpieces, &quot;Isn't it a Pity.&quot;<br />I can's say enough superlatives about this DVD. All George and Beatles fans will cherish this concert.tch Paul as he strums the ukelele while singing &quot;Something.&quot; It's obvious he is struggling not to break down and cry.

B00006879E|4.0|When you think of Maroon 5, try to imagine Jamiroquai (a funky danceable Motown R&amp;B flavor) meets Lenny Kravitz (rock with a hint of R&amp;B, without going over too much) and you can come close to imagining how they sound (&quot;Shiver&quot; is probably the perfect example of this). Now, step back and consider that musical blend for a minute: these guys are pulling off a combination of styles that normally are not married to each other. Rock and Motown R&amp;B speak different languages: they walk on different sides of the street, so to speak. But these guys manage to walk in the middle (alongside the &quot;traffic&quot;, if you may).<br />This whole &quot;melange&quot; caught the attenion of mainstream radio not too long ago (considering the album was released in the summer of 2002), putting the tales of lead singer Adam Levine's ex-girlfriend, Jane, in everyone's lips by late 2003, and pushing 'Songs About Jane' into Amazon's Top 20 best selling albums of early 2004.<br />My favorites close up the album: the powerful &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, the quiet &quot;Secret&quot;, the live track &quot;Not coming home&quot; and the very aptly titled &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; wrapping it up. I take off one star because of some of the more pop formula songs such as &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Must Get Out&quot; which do not do justice to their full potential.
B000000W5P|5.0|Originally recorded and released in 1978, the Stones were facing the loud and fast 'Punk Revolution' exploding in England and all over the world. The Stones' answer to this musical revolution was 'Some Girls' which is a short but sweet masterpiece. While 'Miss You' reminds you of the rather 'funky' and 'mellow' Black and Blue album, the Stones get down to the dirty business with 'When the whip comes down'. 'Just My Imagination' is a wonderful cover version of this classic and 'Some Girls' is a dirty blues track and one of my all time favorite Stones songs. 'Lies', 'Respectable' and 'Shattered' are merciless rockers, 'Before the Make me Run' is probably the best song with Keith on lead vocals (or at least equal to 'Happy') and 'Beast of Burden' is an absolute Stones classic - one of their greatest songs ever. Then there is their country tune 'Far Away Eyes' which is rather good as well... so if you are looking for the &quot;Stones rocking their socks off&quot;, get this album !
B0000AFX64|4.0|Originally released on ABC-TV in a 3 hour format on a Sunday night, this is a great special effects movie for it's time.  Boasted to cost in excess of 1 million an episode (thats one FRIENDS salary today), there are prevelant special effects.  The story in this original feature beats all that followed and Did you know that they re-released this film but in to theaters and added SENSURROUND?  Cool!
B000066NW0|1.0|I have been perplexed by the success of this wannabe poser, who claims to be ultra-talented and so &quot;cutting edge&quot;.  Please....  Avril Levine is another one of those flashes in the pan, who happened to get a good album producing team.  For all of you who think Avril is so &quot;brilliant&quot; for coming up with this new sound, please give credit where it is due: her producers.  It drives me crazy when singers proclaim their own genius--and neglect to admit that their sound is completely fabricated by their production team.  Madonna is another one of these types.

B0001906O0|5.0|If you are not a big Cure fan then go away. This is not for you. If you are keep reading.<br />It's great to finally have all of those wonderful B-sides and rarities in 1 place. And it's about time those great songs from the b-side of the 'Staring at the Sea' tape got remastered (wasn't that outtake collection called 'Standing on a Beach'). You'll also get lots of remixes and covers. Having 3 versions of The Doors' cover &quot;Hello I Love You&quot; seems excessive but I'd rather have more than less - wouldn't you? They also have the Bowie cover &quot;Young Americans&quot;. Wondering why they didn't include Hendrix' &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; though. Do you realize The Cure has done 3 Hendrix covers (Hey Joe, Foxy Lady and Purple Haze)?<br />The most pleasant surprise was the inclusion of the painfully hard-to-find &quot;To the Sky&quot; from the b-side of the 'Concert' live tape release. The biggest disappointment is the non-inclusion of the excellent &quot;Forever&quot; from that same release. Why o' why can they not release this on CD?! And I'll bet you that it doesn't find it's way onto any of the upcoming studio remasters because it wasn't a b-side from any particular release. Also missing are &quot;Carnage Visors&quot; and &quot;Curiousity&quot;. Still the collection is nearly complete and long overdue.<br />The packaging is very nicely done. It looks like a long, thin hardcover book (I didn't just say long, thin and hard did I?) and includes loads of color photos spanning the band's history. Also includes a narrative history that I plan to read soon.<br />OK now, less reading... more buying.
6305252521|5.0|The Truman Show is an excellent movie that really shows off the range of Jim Carrey.  Truman Burbank has been unknowingly taped and put on TV for his whole life.  Bought at birth by a huge corporation, Truman is his own tv show broadcast all over the world.  Everyone around him is an actor.  For almost 30 years, nothing goes wrong, but as Truman grows older he begins to realize something is up and tries to find out what.  This is a great movie that blends comedy and drama.  Carrey has some physical comedy, but much less than in his other films.  Watching Truman try to figure things out are the best scenes in the movie.  Boosting the movie is an excellent score by Burkhard Dallwitz.  This is a very good movie with something for everyone.<br />  Jim Carrey has never been better than his role as Truman Burbank, a man who is unknowingly the star of his own TV show.  This part really allowed him to show that he is more than just a physical comedian.  Ed Harris is equally as good as Christof, the creator of The Truman Show who is so dedicated to his creation that he refuses to let if fail.  Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich also star as Meryl, Truman's wife, and Marlon, Truman's best friend since he was seven.  The DVD offers tv spots, theatrical trailers, and the widescreen presentation.  This is a surprisingly good movie.  The ending is beautifully scripted as Truman tries to find out what is really going on.  For a very good movie with an excellent performance by Jim Carrey, check out The Truman Show!

B00009TB5G|4.0|With its recent victories at the British film awards and the Oscars, `The Return of the King' confirmed why it (and the `Lord of the Rings' series in general) have become one of the biggest cinematic events in film history. But is it too soon to write a review? As has been seen with the film's predecessors, `The Fellowship of the Ring' and `The Two Towers,' recently-issued extended DVD versions are already proving cause for revisionism and reassessment.<br />Anyone who's not been living under a rock (or in a hobbit-hovel) for the past few months knows that the final installment of the `Lord of the Rings trilogy' made box office history in December, taking in over $125 million in its first 5 days (US totals alone). Not only these totals but the film itself is nothing short of remarkable.<br />When word got out about the LOTR project in the late 90's, many diehard Tolkien fans were worried that the film adaptation would be pulled off clumsily, tastelessly, or just wrong-headedly. Yet not even staring at the endless list of credits following the movie can really give the viewer a sense of the monumentally complex achievement here. From special effects to costumes to fight scenes and, of course, spectacular natural scenery, `The Return of the King' delivers a truly unique experience that more than lives up to the challenges set for it by fans...<br />The rest of this review is available at [...]
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is truly like a breath of fresh air and reminds me of a time when Hip Hop was about being a LYRICIST; not talking about ice, rims, how may albums you've sold, or degrading women. This album has substance, tight beats, three of my favorite lyricists (Common, Mos Def, and Talib Kweli) and is just fun...something I haven't said or felt about an album in a while. My favorites are All Falls Down, Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down (except for Jay-Z's part...as usual he dissappointed me by talking about himself on an otherwise deep and uplifting song...who cares Jay?!), Spaceship, and Family Business. By the way, the skits are very funny, too. All in all, a great album I highly recommend.

B00004R7TP|5.0|\\"Hounds of Love\\" is the best Kate Bush album, her most successful, and yet it may be her least accessible.  Certainly it contains a much wider musical range than most albums in 1985, what with the drums, guitars and pianos, followed by the bouzoukis, fiddles, uillean pipes, cellos and balalaikas.  The album also has a wide range of allusion.  Not only does it include a clip from \\"The Wall,\\" but it also makes reference to Tennyson and Reich.  Even more amazingly it actually make the portentous imperialist and the pseudo-scientific quack sympathetic and aesthetically successful.  It starts off with the unusual love song \\"Running up that Hill,\\" (\\"I'd make a deal with God/And get him to swap our places\\").  The video consists of a strange, intimate pair of dancers, which slowly spirals out of the attic where they are dancing to a strange foreign runway.  \\"The Hounds of Love\\" is next and it is probably the song I care about the least.  But then there is the joyful cheeriness of  \\"The Big Sky.\\"   Then there is the carefully understated \\"Mother Stands for Comfort,\\"  (\\"She knows that I've been doing something wrong/But she won't say anything.&quot;) \\"Cloudbusting,\\" one of Kate Bush's triumphs, refers to William Reich and his crackpot belief that by manipulating \\"orgone energy\\" (energy from orgasms) he could make it rain.  Yet the song is a moving success, with its cello-driven melody, notwithstanding the fact that in both the song and the video Bush is playing a boy.   (\\"Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen/And I don't know when/But just saying it could even make it happen.\\")<br />Then there is the second side, \\"The Ninth Wave.\\"   The songs are all clearly different from each other, in style and tempo and instrumentation, and they discuss such subjects as sleeping, ice-skating, witch-hunts, ghosts, Irish jigs, the evening and a statement of love.  But they are all united in their theme about a drowning woman.  It starts off with the apparently soft and increasingly sinister \\"And Dream of Sheep.\\" (\\"Like poppies, heavy with seed/They take me deeper and deeper\\").  Then there is the short, effective and quite chilling violin driven \\"Under Ice.\\"  The dramatic \\"Waking the Witch\\" follows, where Bush is confronted by a demonic inquisitor and which contains the aforementioned Pink Floyd reference, a forceful drumbeat as well as a brief sequence of bells.  But the best cut is \\"Watching you Without Me,\\" about the strange ghostlike presence, which is my favourite Kate Bush song of all.  Here her voice, singing relatively understated material, shows off its true power and nuance.  Then there is \\"Jig of Life\\" as well as \\"Hello Earth.\\"  The latter is the longest song on the album, as it starts off with childish innocence (Hello Earth/With just one hand help up high/I can blot you out,) and then moves on to a threatening storm.  Finally there is \\"The Morning Fog,\\" with its simple melody, relatively simple arrangement and genuine expression of love for her family.  (The 1998 CD includes six other songs, including remixes of \\"Running up that Hill\\" and \\"The Big Sky.\\"  The four unreleased songs are all good, though they do not cohere with the original album.  The best of them is \\"Burning Bridge.\\")
B0000C7PSW|1.0|If you love radiohead, you'll like Rufus.  He writes music just like them.  A little bit too much of a contrived attempt at being the great band means his sound doesn't come off as naturally as Yorke, who sings like that just because he does... and it works.  As for Rufus... well... he sings like that because he can get away with it now that Yorke has cleared the way for him.  Again I ask: originality?
2709624931|1.0| <br />Avant tout, je voudrais dire que j'&eacute;prouve la plus grande affinit&eacute; pour le message philosophique et spirituel que pr&eacute;sente par l'auteur de ce livre. Mais j'aurais souhait&eacute; qu'un romancier au talent av&eacute;r&eacute; (du calibre de l'Am&eacute;ricain Tom Robbins, par exemple) ait put mettre la main sur ce sujet, pour le rehausser d'une dose d'&eacute;rudition plus solide que celle dont Dan Brown fait preuve. H&eacute;las, Da Vinci Code me laisse l'impression que les Bob Morane que je lisais quand j'avais une dizaine d'ann&eacute;es (c'&eacute;tait dans les ann&eacute;es cinquante) appartiennent aux grands chefs d'&#339;uvres de la litt&eacute;rature mondiale, tant il semblent bien construits en comparaison.<br />Ce n'est pas que le d&eacute;bit d'absurdit&eacute;s et d'illogismes dont la trame du roman est parsem&eacute;e, qui m'autorise &agrave; poser la question de savoir si l'auteur s'est pr&eacute;occup&eacute; de relire son manuscrit avant de l'envoyer &agrave; l'impression. En fait, ce qui m'a gên&eacute; bien plus profond&eacute;ment, ce sont les incoh&eacute;rences prof&eacute;r&eacute;es par quelqu'un qui, &agrave; la rigueur, aurait pass&eacute; quelques semaines en Europe, mais - probablement conscient du fait que son public &eacute;tats-unien ne remarquerait jamais la diff&eacute;rence - ne s'est gu&egrave;re souci&eacute; de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une &eacute;tude s&eacute;rieuse du cadre o&ugrave; se d&eacute;roule l'action de son roman (de fait, The Da Vinci Code semble avoir battu tous les records de vente).<br />Quelques exemples pour d&eacute;montrer que, de nos jours, le ridicule a cess&eacute; de tuer le tirage : selon Dan Brown, les informations fournies par les clients des hôtels d'Europe dans les fiches remplies &agrave; la r&eacute;ception sont imm&eacute;diatement disponibles &agrave; l'Interpol (un rêve pour certains, suivez mon regard, mais quand même...). Un homme se fait arrêter dans un port quelconque de la France m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne, mais il est incarc&eacute;r&eacute;... en Andorre ! D'o&ugrave; il s'enfuit en sautant sur un train de marchandises (lequel, nous faut-il supposer, a &eacute;t&eacute; aiguill&eacute; par erreur sur les lignes de t&eacute;l&eacute;ski?). Dans l'original en anglais, un officier de la police judiciaire parisienne s'exclame \\"Jesu!\\" [sic - en portuguais dans le texte],  - peut-être a-t-il vu trop de films am&eacute;ricains? - tandis que la police du comt&eacute; du Kent, en Angleterre, s'empresse, &agrave; quatre heures du matin, d'ob&eacute;ir aux ordres lanc&eacute;s depuis son cellulaire en France par le \\"Capitaine\\" [re-sic] de la police judiciaire française, lequel r&eacute;pond au nom plutôt insolite de Bezu Fache. En passant, nous apprenons que Godefroi de Bouillon est un roi français, et que certaines banques suisses op&egrave;rent sur le territoire français selon les normes de discr&eacute;tion en vigueur en Suisse. Pour compl&eacute;ter, la bonne Sophie, une jeune femme que toutes les apparences pr&eacute;sentent comme intelligente, &eacute;nergique et plein d'allant, mais qui n'avait n&eacute;anmoins jamais d&eacute;couvert que le \\"château\\" de son grand-p&egrave;re &eacute;tait muni d'une cave, est, la pauvre, afflig&eacute;e d'une n&eacute;vrose tellement avanc&eacute;e (l'auteur ne nous le dit pas, mais c'est bien ce qu'il nous faut inf&eacute;rer) qu'&agrave; l'âge de vingt-deux ans, elle coupe tous les ponts avec ce même grand-p&egrave;re pour l'avoir surpris en plein acte sexuel.<br />Et j'en passe... D'autres lecteurs, en Angleterre, ont ramass&eacute; quelques perles du même acabit. Comme on dirait l&agrave; d'o&ugrave; vient Dan Brown : \\"Please give me a break...\\" ou, en français, \\"Je t'en prie, arrête de charrier...\\".<br />Le r&eacute;sultat fait peine &agrave; lire. Confront&eacute;s &agrave; de telles faiblesses, on en vient &agrave; se demander si l'abondance d'&eacute;ruditiondont le livre fait preuve doit être pris &agrave; la lettre, en d&eacute;pit du fait qu'il ait une tendance prononc&eacute;e &agrave; ressembler &agrave; un collage de donn&eacute;es puis&eacute;es ci et l&agrave; dans le monde de l'&eacute;sot&eacute;risme. Ces sujets ne me sont pas tr&egrave;s familiers, mais j'ai constat&eacute; que d'autres lecteurs, tant en Grande-Bretagne qu'aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, ont mis en cause la validit&eacute; des recherches historiques effectu&eacute;es par Dan Brown. Et, bien entendu, ce n'est pas aux fanatiques qui se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s contre sa d&eacute;nonciation de la Chr&eacute;tient&eacute; que je me r&eacute;f&egrave;re ici.<br />Summa summarum, il est plutôt dommage qu'un message aussi digne d'&eacute;loges que celui qui constitue le substrat de cet ouvrage soit maltraît&eacute; de mani&egrave;re si brutale qu'il risque d'&eacute;chapper &agrave; l'attention de ceux qui, comme moi, sont un tantinet exigeants en mati&egrave;re de rigueur intellectuelle. En ce qui me concerne, je n'ai aucune intention de lire la suite de Da Vinci Code qui nous semble promise. Quant aux ouvrages pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents de Dan Brown, n'en parlons pas.<br /> tion de la Chrétienté que je me réfère ici.<br />Summa summarum, il est plutôt dommage qu'un message aussi digne d'éloges que celui qui constitue le substrat de cet ouvrage soit maltraîté de manière si brutale qu'il risque d'échapper à l'attention de ceux qui, comme moi, sont un tantinet exigeants en matière de rigueur intellectuelle.

0805053883|5.0|This is a fun interactive book about the animals in the zoo and the sounds they make.  It's a great vocabulary builder, since it uses words that small kids may not hear every day.  The book is quite enjoyable for kids who like animals, and not at all scary.  The story may get kids wound up, however, so it might not be the best choice for a bedtime story.  The book has about 200 words.
B000002WMH|5.0|If God appeared and said I could have only one box set, or even one collection of music on cd, this is the one I would choose. This set is the only way someone, who did not actually live during the 1950's and through the initial Elvis mania, could even come close to understanding what it was like and do grasp his impact on music and culture. The great thing about this set is that it covers, even though all in the late '50's, different aspects of Elvis' carrer. It contains the Sun Sessions, the birth of Rock and Roll, the recordings of, probably, his four best movies and movie soundtracks, His most successful and best Christmas music, great early gospel performances, alternate and rare studio and live recordings and of course, all the other secular recordings of the decade. This box set argues not that he was and still is the King of Rock and Roll alone, but the King of Popular Music.
0452282152|3.0|I've finished, not being able to put this down. Does that make it a good book?     Somehow, there wasn't enough there to make me appreciate Griet, the female lead, as a person. Her outlook struck me as artificial, her decisions formalised, like a 'Candide' character, always out to comment, illustrate, educate. It's the narrative voice that annoys me. It is meant to be that of a 16 year old girl in Vermeer's Holland, and, even accounting for having to grow up early in those times, her thinking and tone is too much that of a shrewd, middle aged woman, and it grates on me. It reads like one of those historical \\"young adult\\" novels which try to educate without anybody noticing. I'm enjoying it, though, in a kind of this-may-grate-but-I-don't-want-to-stop-reading-it kind of way.    The ending was a disappointment to me, even though it had its rationale in Griet's previous decisions. I expected more, something less abrupt, some growth into an unusual direction, rather than doing 'the expected'. I wanted to be surprised, pleasantly or unpleasantly, and the conclusion of the story didn't do that.    What saved the novel for me were Vermeer's paintings, the beautiful conjecture on their conception, the artists eye through which Chevalier looks at the past.
0920668364|5.0|I loved this book, my kids loved this book and my husband even liked this book. I cried when I read it the first couple of times, my husband cried too when he read it the first time.  Very wonderful book about a parents love for her child.  I would recommend this book to any one wanting a good book to read to their child at bedtime or any time of the day.
0140177396|5.0|This was an interesting story of two friends and their dreams that are brought to a halt.  I saw the story as a picture of the ugliness of humanity, apparently harmless but capable of atrocity if pushed to the edge of one's weaknesses.  Even the `competent' friend in the story, George, could not achieve his dreams.  He was impotent to find happiness.  I thought the story was fascinating.  I could not put the book down, and I read the book in about three hours.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Despite many of the bad opinions that some people have of this movie, Tron is a classic that is underappreciated by most people.  The amount of work that went into making this movie is incredible.  And as for &quot;sarah, moviefreak&quot;'s list placing this movie as one of the worst game-to-movie made, this movie was made before the game.
0449002128|5.0|The Good Lord has answered my prayers! Upon reading this very engrossing novel - The Kill Artist, I thought that I would never really find another author who could grip you in plots, twists and turns, killing methods, politics, love, human interplay, and then wrap it ALL in modern situations complete with political over and undertones.....  BRAVO! MORE!!!! I look at my Jewish Brothers and Sisters in a different light after this novel!<BR>ENCORE MORE BRAVO!!!!
B00005RYLE|5.0|On Sunday, September 27, 1998, I bought my first copy of THE EVIL DEAD on VHS at Wal-Mart for $7. This was something I had been looking forward to since I first heard about this movie on Houseofhorrors.com and a Leonard Maltin review. Six days later, at five in the morning (after a nightmare about watching a horror movie where the floor turned into quicksand), I watched THE EVIL DEAD for the first time. And I was hooked! This movie was indeed gory, and is still among the goriest horror movies ever made, but it was genuinely scary as well, with a great music score and atmosphere created in the woods! It became a habit to see THE EVIL DEAD late at night when everybody else was asleep. So far I have seen THE EVIL DEAD about 25 times.<BR>In late March of 2002, my sister Flora gave me this Book Of The Dead Limited Edition DVD as a belated birthday present. This is by far the best packaging of THE EVIL DEAD that Anchor Bay Entertainment has provided. It looks just like the Book Of The Dead in the movie right down to the pages! (And no, I have not tried to recite any of the passages in the book.) The DVD has a great widescreen transfer of the film, a fun audio commentary track by the star of the film, Bruce Campbell (I listened to this track on my most recent viewing), as well as one by director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, a documentary by Campbell about fans of horror and sci-fi, and a documentary on the film's distribution in England, along with a wealth of other cool supplements!<BR>During the weekend of August 16 and 17 of last year, I met special effects artist Tom Sullivan and the ladies of THE EVIL DEAD at the Horrorfind convention in Maryland. They were all really nice; in fact, I learned from Sullivan how he achieved all those effects, saw the props he created, and even learned about how they tried to title and release the film. They also signed my Book Of The Dead and it was one of many wonderful experiences at the convention! All I need now is Bruce Campbell's autograph in my Book Of The Dead (and on my EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS Boomstick Edition); hopefully I'll get it this year! If you still haven't seen THE EVIL DEAD yet, then get with the program and go rent it; better yet, own it! Join Us!
B000089RVX|5.0|The lyrics are deep and emotional......expressing a lot of feeling and oftentimes, pain.  Amy Lee has a very intense voice, very spiritual at times, and she makes you believe the song. My favorite cut is Going Under, but there are many excellent songs on the CD. The instrumentation is intense at times, and backs up the lyrics well.  It's easy to see why Evanescence won two Grammy awards this year.
B000066NW0|1.0|Let me say something here.  Avril just seems to love to dis Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.  Okay, you gotta laugh at that.  Christina, first of all, can give this girl some vocal lessons.  She needs them.  Then, when Avril finally learns to sing, Christina and Britney both can give her some dancing lessons too.  Standing on stage with a terrible voice, not moving except to hop up and down like a bunny rabbit on crack, and singing crappy lyrics just doesn't cut it for me.  You hate Britney and love Avril?  Good for you.  You say Avril sings what she feels and writes her own music?  Okay...well, people, when the lyrics suck, you almost want the &quot;artist&quot; to hire a writer.  I still have respect for those who don't write their own music.  Norah Jones did not right the songs on Come Away With Me but I still adore her!  Britney isn't the best signer but at least she can perform.  Avril sings worse than Britney.  Her voice isn't just okay, it sucks ass.  I wish Avril would lip synch and wear a python around her neck with a string bikini, though she probably wouldn't have anything to put in the top area.  If she lip synched with pythons, her audience would get better money's worth than if she did her usual performance crap.  Avril doesn't sing, she warbles.  She has no range.  My 10 year-old sister writes better than she does.  You don't rhyme 'boi' with 'boi.' Apparently, Avril never learned spelling fundamentals back in Canada, either.  So sad.  Avril, please give me back my $13.50.  Or better yet, pay it to my mother, since she's the one who bought me this piece of crap.
8590379817|5.0|Lua is a gem among programming languages. Its designers have commendably placed a high value on keeping the language small, readable and portable. The diminutive size and simple syntax of Lua, however, belie a very rich, highly factored and stable architecture. It is a fun language in which to program. Lua dovetails beautifully with lower level languages by means of a C interface, and its drum tight language processor and libraries are right at home in event-driven graphical applications as well as console programs.<br />The excellent book &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; by Roberto Ierusalimschy provides developers with a broad summary of the language. The author includes a myriad of small examples, each of which is well focused and easily grasped. Different solutions to a given problem are often accompanied by benchmark figures. Prof. Ierusalimschy has an educator's gift for finding the appropriate level at which to write, and readers will appreciate the conversational nature of his writing. Unlike many programming language books, &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; has a strong content-to-fluff ratio throughout. <br />The book provides valuable explanations of language and library features which even the careful reader of the Lua reference manual might miss. In addition, over twenty C library entry points are discussed (and, thankfully, indexed) which are not mentioned in the reference manual.<br />It is hard to conceive of a software project which would not benefit from using Lua, both as an embedded component and as a standalone interpreter of scripts. The book &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; is valuable for anyone with an interest in this lovely language.
B00006690G|5.0|No song on this CD is like the one preceding it.  Somehow, Eminem is able to allow the audience to feel what he feels and sometimes, to even think what he thinks.  If you disagree with some of what he says, you at least get where he's coming from.  This CD doesn't just have great beats and thought-provoking lyrics - some of these songs tell a story.  This guy has so much talent that it's freakin' unbelievable.  Nowadays, you've got quite a few rappers who all sound the same.  I'm not gonna say names...but they're there.  Eminem has sold more than most people out there not only cuz he's white, which is a big part, but also cuz of the material.  Great songs and skits!  He's gonna be around for a looooong time.
B00005JMCT|1.0|Expectantly, this will be the last attempted installment of The Pie.<br />Hopelessly crass and pervasively stupid humor is the only thing keeping this movie from being thrown into the incinerator. Anticipating some form of entertainment in this slapstick retardation, it was about as amusing as watching mushrooms grow; difficult to keep from nodding off in this one. Wait, I think I did! At moments when things are clearly dull, nudity; a certain death toll for ANY film who utilizes it like a life-preserver vest. On top of it all - seriously poor film editing. Story lines and scenes jump around as spastically as a gerbil on speed, leaving you to the subliminal pondering of \\"huh?\\" I dare say a high-school editing crew could have done a better job. Noticeable departures from the original cast include: Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, &amp; Mena Suvari who are noticeably missed at times, but oddly never mentioned.<br />Once again, however, Eugene Levy does a commendable job keeping this one afloat with his father-be-wise humorous methodology to the underage diatribe that is relentless at best. I loved the original, tolerated the second pretty well, but this thing is an utter failure. It is certainly the kind of film that will undoubtedly mar any actor's filmography; leading one to strike it off their list of \\"movies they've been in.\\"
B00000DG1R|4.0|Nothing more about this album than to say its awesome! It really is. All of their biggest hits. I wasn;t even familiar with all of them, but now I am and love them! A cd worth buying, and a band that rocks!~
B000069AUI|2.0|I have to agree that this is a disappointing CD.  It's not even that it's bad, just unoriginal &amp; derivative- there's not a note or idea on this album that hasn't been done better by someone else.  This is the first one I've ever heard by Coldplay, so I can't compare it to their previous discs, but I bought it mostly because I'd heard Clocks and liked the sound.  Typically the singles tend to be my least favorites on a disc; usually the singles are the most accessible and &quot;catchy&quot; sonds on a disc, while the meatier stuff doesn't get the airplay.  For me this disc was like going to a comedy only to find out that every funny moment was in the trailer, and the rest is just filler.<br />This isn't a terrible album by any means- quite the contrary, I guess given the sad state of music nowadays, this is probably actually above average.  If you get a good deal on it, it may be worth buying for the two or three really good songs.  Otherwise, pass on this one.<br />I give it two stars.
B00008NRI8|2.0|Fresh of watching &quot;About A Boy&quot; I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; a shot, which was a mistake.  While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry.  In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions.  As a result, I never felt like they should be together.  Further, the plot seems to jump around.  Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it.  THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose.  After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway.  This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.
B000063CMK|5.0|Alright! This album may be PoS and conceptual, but it's not Perfect Element and even less Entropia and Concrete Lake. <br />It's GREAT music in my opinion. Daniel has a cosmic mind and this album shows Pain of Salvation are open to evolution.<BR>This is an emotional and melodic work; unlike the previous Pink Floydish &quot;the world is a mess, let's tell people&quot; albums. Remedy Lane is a personal artwork from Daniel Gildenlow (one of the greatest intellectual artist of our time). It's entering a world of romanticised disfunction.<br />The range of diversity in PoS's music is a precious thing to me. While &quot;Fandango&quot; messes with Rap, &quot;Chain Sling&quot; flirts with Latin, you have to deal with &quot;Second Love&quot; being a hard core POP Ballad. But you cannot escape the intensity of &quot;Ending Theme&quot; &quot;Rope Ends&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;: they convey so much emotion and so many levels of it.<br />Even though this album is not what you'd expect from Pain of Salvation after hearing Entropia and One Hour By the Concrete Lake, it's still GREAT (what else can I say!). I thought it was a little too accessible if you're into political, activist metal (that's what Entropia and Hour were), but hey! MUSICIANS are humans too! Don't just label Art 'mediocre' just because it's personal, please.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This movie takes place during the depression, in fact the first hour is just that, depressing. That is the wonder of the movie though. You go from a feeling of complete and utter loss and hopelessness to one of triumph and hope.<br />Maguire does performs well as Seabiscuits Jockey, he is also one of the films producers.<br />The movie starts off slowly at first, with a before and after effect of the great depression, throwing people lives into chaos and dispair so very quickly. Harris, played by Bridges, does not lose so much his wealth, yet other tragedy strikes him.<br />From the start he appears as a can-do person, who sees the opportunities in everything and feels he can help others make it as well. That is the story of the movie opportunity and second chances.<br />Seabiscuit is a wonderful movie for a message of hope. You feel like a winner. Is it too late to take a chance to do great things in life? There is a second chance.<br />Look for the wonderful irony of the movie as well. There are so many scenes where you can see it.<br />The movie will take you to Mexico, Santa Barbara, Saratoga Springs, NY and Santa Anita. This movie is true to life if you know anything about Santa Anita Race Track.<br />The only thing that may challenge some is the language. Did people in those circles really talk that way then? I really wonder, this movie can be for the whole family, but too many places Maguire feels he has to use some form of profanity. Some families therefore should see if there is a more family friendly version for the kids.
B000002J27|5.0|I have been listening to this record since the late 70s, and I never got tired of it. Each song is magnificent, but they all blend together to form a symphony, with the main themes coming back in the genial last cut: &quot;Los Endos&quot;. Together with &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, this is the best of Genesis. I stopped listening to their music after &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot;: they completely lost their magic for me.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I enjoyed the concept of this movie and the cast was just tremendous.<br />I felt it was like watching the British All-Stars.  All of the acting they did was outstanding, yet the movie troubled me.<br />It was Love Actually, actually it was more about dysfunctional lives and relationships.<br />The warm part of the movie and the potential starts and ends with those at the airport, the mosiac of loved ones hugging one another and a reference to 9-11 and the question is there still love in the world.  This is the most touching piece of filmography I can remember.  With Hugh Grant narrating as people come up hugging and crying and laughing, you witness love, actually.<br />There are some great moments in this movie with some great twists.<br />I felt the down side though was that there was too much flirtation with cheating, dicussing sex to a young child that was way beyond his years, fairly graphic shots of a couple progressively 'practicing' sex scenes for lighting.  If just this last one was eliminated the movie could be a classic because there are dysfunctions in life.  Yet I felt there were too many that did not really show the love, actually, shown at the airport.<br />It is a good movie for couples to discuss relationships and where they see themselves.  There are some cute relationships and some neat twists, yet it is not for everyone.
B00012QM86|5.0|This was one of the most heart wrenching, sad, enlightening movies I have ever viewed. Untill viewing this movie for the first time in 1993, I had never heard of Oskar Schindler, and was very ignorant of the horror that the jewish people faced during the holocaust. I watched this movie, at times covering my eyes, to stop the horror I was witnessing. I cannot imagine what horrors really went on in those concentration camps, yet, I continued to watch, as I could not pull my eyes from the screen. I admit its EXTREMELY difficult to watch in parts, but I encourage anyone thinking of buying it, DO IT!! I watched to the end, and have never cried or felt the emotions I felt watching this movie. I sobbed like I never have before, yet I was so glad I saw Oskar Schindlers story, and the ending which I wont give away, but its the survivors tribute to this man, who gave everything to do the right thing, as much as he could, and still felt he didnt do enough. I cannot reccomend this movie highly enough. Even after all these years, and all the excellent films out there, this movie will remain my favorite for all time. There will never be another movie to cause the emotion this one stirs. To me it ranks up there with The Color Purple, The Titanic, its a classic. Buy it and see for yourself. 100 stars.

B00000K31Q|4.0|This movie is the only movie that I actually have fully memorized.  I'm not talking the kind of memorization where you can recite it only if it's playing at the same time.  I'm talking the kind of memorization where you sit and recite scenes when you're bored.  <br />This is because I've been absolutely hooked on this movie ever since I first saw it in theaters.  It could have been the plot that got me. Sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) wants to date. In particular, she wants to date Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan).  The only thing stopping her is the ulimate rule in her house: NO DATING UNTIL YOU GRADUATE.  Bianca appeals to her single father (Larry Miller), who finally concedes and makes a new rule just as challenging as the first: Bianca could date when her sister did. The roadblock?  Bianca's sister, senior Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), could quite possibly be more against dating in high school than her dad.  Enter Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), new kid to school with a major crush on Bianca, and his friend, Michael (David Krumholtz), who plot to get Kat dating so that, in turn, Bianca will start dating.  The rest of the movie involves Cameron and Michael doing just that, with Patrick (a brown-haired Heath Ledger) engaging in their little game along with the less knowing mega-hotshot Joey.<br />Maybe it was the characters. Kat Stratford has an unchanging, bitter attitude about being yourself and not doing something just because everyone else is. Bianca loves to conform and be popular - basically the exact opposite of Kat. Larry Miller does a great job in his role as the sisters' overprotective dad who's &quot;up to [his] elbows in placenta all day long&quot; in his career as a doctor and is obsessed with keeping his daughters from growing up.  Cameron is easily likable, a boy who becomes fixed on making Bianca his own (pure intentions).  Joey is just as easily not likable as a boy who is also fixed on making Bianca his own (impure intentions). Michael isperfect as an awkward teenager who, I suppose, most would describe as being the &quot;geek&quot; of the movie, while I would disagree (ex., being the one who comes up with the &quot;Joey's just a pawn&quot; plan).  Patrick is hilarious in his attempts to capture Kat's attention.  Other noteworthy characters include Ms. Perky, the unhelpful guidance counselor secretly writing a dirty romance novel; Mr. Morgan, the  Shakespeare-rapping English teacher; and the gym teacher/soccer coach who is the perfect comedic tool. <br />Maybe it was the memorable scenes: Bianca at prom, the detention room, the stadium serenade, Boogie's party, the motorbike, and Kat in English class, just to name a few.<br />I'm not sure what exactly it is about 10 Things I Hate About You - the characters, the plot, the scenes, the catchy Letters to Cleo tune - but it's a movie for anybody who wants a good laugh and wants to see how crazy somebody else's life can get. <br />DVD NOTE: Besides surround sound and a trailer, there are no extras.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the best rap cd's I have heard in a long time. This boy is not talking about degrading women, he is talking about real things. His beats are beautiful, which lead to real though out lyrics, which is rare these days. Thank you Kanye for being real and being original.
B000031WD9|5.0|I watched Revenge of the Nerds they were like American Pie of the eighties.  A televsion show Buffy the Vampire Slayer is like American Pie and X-Files at once.

I don't know how anyone could rate the story under a 4! Remember, don't be afraid to read this book if you are a devout christian. The book is not \\"historical\\" so do not read it as such.

B000001Y5J|3.0|I love nine inch nails and would rate The Fragile, Pretty Hate Machine, and Downward Sprial Higher.  If I could have given three and a half stars I would have but I couldn't.  Sixty percent isn't quite right but close enough.  The album just isn't perfect, it has no overall theme and there aren't that many songs on it.  The songs that are on it are awesome, especially &quot;physical&quot;, a cover, and &quot;happiness in slavery,&quot; which is actually done best on the Woodstock '94 cd. This is still an album for NIN to be proud of, it most definitely influenced his future albums as well as many others. Five Stars for Pretty Hate Machine and Downward Spiral, Four stars for the Fragile, and two stars for his remix records.

Michelle told us in the sequel why she left in the prom, she was afraid Jim would of dumped her, but you know Jim he would never do that he's committed guy.  When Jim wanted to be with Nadia, he came to Michelle and helped him out.  Michelle fell in love with Jim in the beginning, she made the right choice not to say anything having feeling for him and let Jim find out who wanted to be with. Jim was with Nadia, he always think about Michelle and he said good-bye to Nadia and went to Michelle.  Out of all the love scenes in American Pie Jim going to the band camp stage playing the trombone and told Michelle he loved her is my favorite of all time. Do you think Alyson Hannigan ever invited Thomas Ian Nicholas, Jason Biggs, Chris Klein &amp; Eddie Kay Thomas to set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Even if they did they would of love meeting Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Breandon, Tony Head and Michelle Trachtenberg.   Difference between Michelle and Cadence, Michelle went to East Great Falls High, joined the band, is an outcast and she also knows who Jim on the internet, who Stifler is and Paul Finch legendary status.  Michelle dated the right guy and Jim dated the right girl. Cadence never went East Great Falls High even if she did she probably stayed away from Stifler and go for Finch or Kevin.  I always rooted for Finch to win Cadence heart. Jim, Kevin or Oz ever went to Sunnydale and meet the scooby gang they would of been friends with Xander, Willow, Giles, Buffy and Dawn and survived any vampires that comes a way.  If it was Stifler he wouldn't make it out of alive in two seconds if he was in Sunnydale or in Angel.  Stifler is like Spike with a american accent. Jim and Michelle remind of a couple I always know Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg.  I always wish Oz was their, Jim had a problem Oz always know what to do.
B00005T7HG|2.0|I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. I generally find them kind of annoying and pointless. But, seeing as I had to watch this film for Spanish class, why not review it?<br />I didn't like this movie. Nor do I like Madonna. She has this air about her that screams &quot;I'm here and you're not&quot;, ignoring her star status. She doesn't connect with the woman she's portraying, Eva Peron. Antonio Banderas is in a interesting situation, playing varying characters with different perspectives, but that doesn't save &quot;Evita&quot;. I found this to be a very boring film. I don't recommend it unless you're a diehard Madonna fan or a diehard fan of musicals.
B000031WD9|5.0|When I saw the Revenge of the Nerds there were like the American Pie Guys in the 80's.  When I saw the televison show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, they were like American Pie and X-Files at once.  Xander Harris is like Kevin Meyers, Jim Levinstein and Chris &quot;Oz&quot; Ostreichter. Willow Rosenberg is like Michelle Flaherty. Rupert Giles is like Paul Finch.
B00008BXJG|5.0|What can I say about this album? It friggin' rules. One listen, and you can't get it out of your head. Not one bad song on here; it starts phenomenally and ends the same way.<br />Bon Scott to me has the perfect rock 'n' roll singing voice. Raspy, foul, and uncaged. I love it, and it shines on this album. The Young brothers wrote some of their most kick-ass riffs here, with the sludgy title track, the good-time salute to general teenage boy-ery \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\", the kinda-depressing-but-fast-paced-so-it's-not-really-depressing \\"Shot Down in Flames\\", and the ominous \\"Night Prowler\\". Ten tracks of pure gold. BUY THIS.
B00005JMCT|5.0|This movie is better than Just Married.  Stifler and Cadence  are like Tom Leezak and Sarah McNerney a boring normal married couple who would be divorced three or four years that's why I didn't. Seann William Scott knew January Jones Dude's Where's My Car when she was dating Ashton Kutcher.  Stifler didn't see a future with her when he and Finch didn't get the girl.  If Kevin's girlfriend showed up I was always wish Sarah Michelle Gellar played his girlfriend. No way Stifler thought a beautiful girl go for Kevin.  Of all the wedding movies I saw this one is my favorite, because I rooted for Jim Levinstein and Michelle Flaherty.  Kevin, Finch and Jim's Dad loved Michelle that's why they rooted for Jim to Marry her.
B000002NJS|5.0|If there is a sound that makes me remember 1998, it would be this album, Madonna's \\"Ray Of Light\\". After a four year break after the lukewarm response to her previous album \\"Bedtime Stories\\" Madonna returned to the msuic scene with what I would consider her greatest and most spiritually mature work that she has ever done to date. It's really a pity that this is Madonna's last great album to date. \\"Music\\" is enjoyable but nothing that sticks in your head and \\"American Life\\" was an epic dissapointment. I can still remember the spooked feelings that I got when the whispering ambiences of \\"Substitute For Love\\" came out of my speakers during that dark, damp evening of March of 1998 when I bought this album. Even now, six full years removed from when first hearing it, SFL still gives me the most euphoric chills I've ever experienced in music. Everything afterwards is a long perpetual epic adventure through innovative techno, New Age, and rock dance music but this is no generic dance record by any stretch of the imagination. Not a chance. \\"Ray of Light\\" is light years beyond other dance music of it's time.<br />\\"Frozen\\" was a well-deserved classic that still brings chills to me when listening to it. It has a very dramatic and very melencholy mood to it and the video that accompanied it was absolutely stunning. Some may look at me strange but I kind of think of this song as the antithesis of \\"Open Your Heart\\". Where as OYH is a fun and sunny 1980s dance classic, \\"Frozen\\" is a very dark and rainy evening song with a very haunting orchestral style. Looking back on it now, amidst the disappointing music she's put out over the past year, \\"Frozen\\" is now one of my favorite charting singles of all time of her's. My favorite track on this entire album though is track 5, \\"Skin\\". Whoa! This song back in early 1998, scared the daylights out of me. It starts with a very murky electronic intro, dissolves into ghostly whispers and finally becomes a pulsating, intense, and eerie dance song that really spooked me, in a great way, at it's incredibly eerie atmosphere.<br />As of writing this review, this album remains unrivalled by anything Madonna has put out ever since, and in fact, I would even go as to say that there has yet to come an album that brings the thrills that \\"Ray of Light\\" did in early 1998. If you had to pick three Madonna albums, this is one of them. The others would be \\"EROTICA\\" and \\"Like A Prayer\\". Go for the rest if you like but these three albums in my opinion showcased the major pinnacles Madonna reached over the past 20 years and perhaps sometime in the near future she may wow us again just like she did with this album back during 1998-1999. I generally find it hard to really give a good opinion on it but I feel so sorry for those who missed this really period from early 1998-through the middle of 1999.<br />I could listen to this album in the year 2018, 20 years after being released, and it wouldn't sound a day out of place. If you like this one, then I would recommend \\"Mezzanine\\" by Massive Attack. With these two, you will experience an adventure like nothing before. Amidst the decline of music that would start around this time, these two albums in my opinion really saved 1998 from being a dud of a year.ong that really spooked me, in a great way, at it's incredibly eerie atmosphere. <br />As of writing this review, this album remains unrivalled by anything Madonna has put out ever since, and in fact, I would even go as to say that there has yet to come an album that brings the thrills that \\"Ray of Light\\" did in early 1998.

B00018TI5E|5.0|This album simply leaves me speechless. It is a true example of the purest form of artistic beauty. I love the pureness of John's not so perfect voice. Simply amazing... SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!
B00008H2LB|2.0|I really want to like this album but it does sound TOO much like their previous effort.  Secondly, and more importantly, I swear every song has a chorus of &quot;I, ME and YOU&quot;.  Seriously, if you pay attention to the number of times these three words are used, you'll never be able to listen to the album again!!  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Someone should go on Amazon and buy these fellas a book by Webster.
0440419514|1.0|I slogged through the first two books and kept hoping for some more character development. By book three, I was worn out. I couldn't get beyond the first paragraph of book three. The writing is a perfect entry for one of those horrible writing contests; \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"... style.
1928733018|2.0|My advise is that you CAN get this tape.... it had somehelpful tips... but not a lot. It's not really worth it. It goes over what we all know. And the \\"How To Pose\\" is a joke. It should be changed to \\"How To Look Constipated.\\" You'd be better off getting a book about modeling. Don't overlook modeling school!! I am currently in a school and I have learned A LOT! That's the best information that I have ever found!
B003ASLJQS|3.0|I saw MYSTIC RIVER at a budget cinema on the afternoon just before the Oscars. It was the only one of the the Best Picture nominees I had not seen and I wanted to make the slate complete. I will say this much for the movie, it does have some good acting and some good directing. I didn't think much of Sean Penn's performance because it didn't seem all that different from a lot of other characters he has played. I did enjoy Tim Robbins' performance better, but overall felt that Kevin Bacon was the real star of this movie. He was the overlooked actor in this movie and his portrayal is far more realistic and moving than either Robbins' or Penn's. Clint Eastwood has become a very talented director and has become an expert at panning back and forth from wild angle shots to small frame ones. The film gets a bonus star for Clint's direction.<br /><br />With that said, there really isn't anything all that great about MYSTIC RIVER. The movie is depressing to view and moves very, very slow (I looked at my watch the first time only 30 minutes into the film). There is nothing absolutely uplifting or enduring about the picture. There is nothing comical. There is very little that is even realistic. There isn't even any message to take away. Instead, the movie is a collage/rip-off. The movie is a collage because it tries to make itself look important, containing all sort of elements of good filmmaking. It wants to be a work of art, and in some ways it is. However, it never does make the leap that it wants to from just being a movie to being a film. Instead, it flounders in all of the artistic devices of it's own being. The movie is also a rip-off because really the movie is another retelling of THE GODFATHER, but in a slightly different setting and a more modern time. I mean, the last fifteen minutes of the movie are almost taken directly from parts of THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER II. Those were good movies. This was not.<br /><br />Overall, MYSTIC RIVER is not a very enjoyable movie to watch. It's not a thinking film, nor is it a movie with a message. Instead, it's a collage of cinematic art and scenes ripped-off from classic American films. The acting is pretty good and so is the directing. For that, it's one star better than it should be.

B00005221M|3.0|I watched this when it came out in 1992, and have seen the original theatrical version at least ten times since then.  The original is a masterpiece, a five-star film and one of the best films of the 90's.  <br />I bought the new DVD, which is supposed to be &quot;enhanced.&quot; I sat down to watch it with my wife while telling her how great this movie was (she had never seen it), but I did not realize how much was added and cut from the original.  This DVD is not &quot;enhanced&quot; at all.  Michael Mann should have listened to his original editors intstead of stroking his own ego on this DVD release.<br />Very much is added at the beginning of the film, making it confusing to know what is even going on if you've never seen the original.  The added scenes take away from the pace of the movie.  Parts of the movie are cut from the river scene, the fight scene between Magua and Uncas, and much dialogue is added where not needed (which changed and took away from an already great climax to the film).  <br />Do yourself a favor, buy the VHS version. You will not be disappointed.  As for the DVD, save your money and wait for the 9.99 &quot;Fox Classics&quot; DVD release at Walmart, whenever that happens.
B00009V7P8|3.0|i was pretty disappointed when i bought this album, considering all the great reviews it was getting.  i had heard a few songs, and they were really good, so i bought it.  well, the songs i knew i liked were still good, but the rest of the album was bland and boring.  all the songs up to and including &quot;cannonball&quot; and &quot;i remember&quot; are the good half--the rest of the songs are basically unlistenable.  but...that's just me.  so personally i think that if you are thinking about buying this album...burn it instead, then see what you think.
B000002BBY|5.0|&quot;What's the Story&quot; is simply a masterpiece. Every song is perfect. It's Noel at his best as a songwriter. It's Liam at his best vocally. Everything comes to together in a way that can't be explained. It's pure. It's simple. It's rock'n'roll at it's best. No album since this one has even come close to it, and no album ever will. And it contains the two best songs ever written in the modern era, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Champagene Supernova&quot;. The latter of these being a true and perfect masterpiece. &quot;Champagne Supervova&quot;, the song itself, was enough put Oasis into the Hall of Fame. And without a doubt, they will be there someday.
B0000DBJ2B|3.0|I'm a great fan of this movie, it's probably in my personal top ten favorite films (or if not then definitely in the top twenty), but while it's a great film this is not a great DVD.<br />The transfer of the movie is acceptable but not great - it's in widescreen as it should be, but there is still dirt and noise in various parts. The color and sharpness are superior to the previous VHS versions of course but that's about it.<br />The main thing the DVD lacks is extras - this &quot;set&quot; is a single disc containing both the movie and supplements, and the only significant one is the &quot;World of the Dark Crystal&quot; making-of documentary. Everything else is lacking. There are storyboards, very well drawn storyboards in fact, but there is only a small sampling of a few of them (6 I think, maybe less) not storyboards for the whole movie. Then there are character illustrations and profiles - when I first saw these I though &quot;great, well worth having&quot; as they are beautiful pieces of artwork by Brain Froud - however I quickly realized that there are only a few of these too, not one for every character, or at least every major character, as I had hoped.<br />The biggest disappointment was the lack of running commentary. This is my favorite feature on any DVD, particularly when there are several commentary tracks. When they are well done it's a fantastic feature - see Fight Club, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Criterion edition), The Lord of the Rings series (extended editions), The Simpsons box sets and most of Kevin Smith's movies for examples of great commentaries. So how many commentary tracks do you get on this DVD? Zero. 0. Goose egg. Nada. Zip. Zilch. I know Jim Henson is dead, and it was tragic that he died so young, but Frank Oz, the co-director and a  major performer in the film is still with us as are many others who worked on it, as well as Jim Henson's kids, and so on. I'm not buying another edition of this DVD after feeling ripped off by this one however, so if they do crank out the &quot;ultra super mondo special really really final and this time we mean it&quot; edition with commentary I'm not buying it. Had this version been correctly priced for what it is, $20, maybe $25 max instead of $45, I might have shelled out again for another future edition but as it is, forget it.<br />The reproduction of Jim Henson's original notepad with his first ideas for The Dark Crystal is really rather dull and uninteresting. The frame of 35mm film from the movie that comes in the set is a novelty but not really a big deal - and that's about all you get. In this day and age where you can get some really great values on DVD (Lord of the Rings extended editions for example) this stands out as a bad deal. The Simpsons seasons 2 and 3 sets cost about $12 less than this for far more material, same for The Lord of the Rings films.<br />Go for the more basic, less expensive version of the DVD, the &quot;boxed set&quot; isn't worth it, though this great movie definitely is.<br />Overall 3 stars - would have been 4 stars if it was reasonably priced, 5 if they had the extras like commentary too.

0316921173|5.0|Say farewell, at least for a month or so, to your family, friends, and other hobbies. Figure out a way to fortify your fingers, wrists, and arms so you can hold this book up for hours at a time over a period of weeks. Reconfigure the lighting arrangement in your reading area for maximum glow. Find two sturdy bookmarks. Take a deep breath, let it out real slow, and you are ready to begin the monumental task of reading David Foster Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest.&quot; It took me three solid weeks to navigate a path through the byzantine structures of Wallace's magnum opus, three weeks of reading at least twenty pages a day (often more than that, of course) to get through the nearly 1,000 pages of text and the ninety plus pages of endnotes that make up this novel. If you have heard of Wallace before, and you probably have if you are checking out reviews for the book, you know &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; has quite a reputation in the literary world. You will see stuffed shirts tossing around words like &quot;post post-modernism&quot; and other academic jargon while referring to Wallace's oeuvre. Don't let these old fogies get you down; &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is an immensely readable, hypnotically fascinating novel chock full of great humor, great sadness, and thought provoking themes.<br />The novel takes place in Enfield, Massachusetts in the near future. In the story, Canada, the United States, and Mexico formed a federation called the Organization of North American Nations (known as O.N.A.N.). The citizens of this confederation spend their time watching entertainment cartridges playable on their &quot;teleputers,&quot; devices that came about when broadcast television went bankrupt. Advertisers predictably had a cow over the loss of television, so the government allowed companies to purchase calendar years and rename them. Hence, we have years called &quot;The Year of Glad,&quot; and &quot;The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment.&quot; Not everyone is happy with the O.N.A.N. arrangement; Quebecois revolutionaries continue to seek an independent homeland from their Canadian masters, only now they have to deal with the United States as well. In a devious bid for independence, a group of terrorists known as &quot;The Wheelchair Assassins&quot; (!) are seeking a film cartridge that supposedly kills anyone who watches it by turning them into pleasure seeking zombies. Moreover, a new energy system called annular fusion requires the confederation to dump its toxic waste into a place called &quot;The Great Concavity,&quot; an abandoned area encompassing most of Maine and other northeastern regions. The concavity borders Quebec, and the toxins flung there with giant catapults (!!) have leeched into surrounding areas, thus causing thousands of people to develop life-threatening deformities.<br />Wallace introduces dozens of oddball characters in the course of his narrative, with special emphasis placed on the students at the Enfield Tennis Academy and the addicts populating a drug rehab right down the hill called Ennet House. The primary character at Enfield is one Hal Incandenza, a genius and a tennis star with a growing addiction to marijuana. Living with Hal are his horribly disfigured brother Mario, his promiscuous but hyper intelligent mother Avril, and several fellow students who redefine our conceptions of the bizarre. Hal has difficulties dealing with his family due to, among other issues, the horrific suicide via microwave oven of his father James. Dad was a scientist who helped develop annular fusion before going into experimental filmmaking. It was, in fact, James Incandenza who made the fatal entertainment cartridge that is causing so many headaches. In opposition to the madhouse that is Enfield is the madhouse that is Ennet House, where drug addict Don Gately attempts to take things one day at a time. Gately lived a life of desperate abandon, burglarizing homes in order to pay for his addictions. The only thing harder than living on drugs is kicking the habit, and Wallace describes in minute detail the hard sought sobriety of Don Gately and his fellow addicts. I know this summary stinks, I know I'm leaving tons of stuff out, but place the blame on Wallace for constructing such a complex novel.<br />Several themes thread their way through the novel. The most notable is the theme of addiction and recovery represented by Hal Incandenza and Don Gately. Another theme is the role of entertainment in American society, something Wallace sees as a calamity of epic proportions that will only end in death. If you tire of looking for deeper meaning in &quot;Infinite Jest,&quot; don't worry. You can laugh yourself sick over the humorous aspects of the book or stare in open-mouthed awe at the numerous digressions from the main story. Wallace is a powerful writer, capable of infusing seemingly banal situations like filmmaking and sports with amazing energy. Check out the story about Hal's brother Orin punting in his first football game, or the Eschaton disaster at the academy, or James Incandenza's filmography in one of the endnotes for proof of this assertion. I especially loved the filmography and the endnote explaining the origins of the Wheelchair Assassins, two of the funniest, most wildly inventive things I have ever read. Most of the book is as equally brilliant even as it veers off in a dozen different directions.<br />&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is intricate, with its multitude of subplots, OED inspired vocabulary, and tragic characters, yet the book still entertains because Wallace knows how to drape a compelling, easily understood story over all of the complexities. I'm under no illusions that I picked up on more than a fraction of the many things Wallace was attempting to say, but who cares? I had a heckuva a ride through this book, and hopefully you will too. Remember, take your time, breathe easy, and don't worry too much about carpal tunnel syndrome.<br />P.S.

B00008BXJF|4.0|After their disappointing 2000 effort, &quot;The ConstrukCtion of Light,&quot; I was skeptical about the future of King Crimson.  Fortunately,  &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; finds the band back in top form.  In fact, while &quot;Power&quot; is not quite as generous an offering as 1995's &quot;Thrak,&quot; it surpasses that record in terms of power, consistency, and sonic excellence.<br />The thematic structure of the record in general and the title track in particular (with its intro, theme and variation, and coda) recalls Crimson's second album, &quot;In The Wake of Poseidon,&quot; with its recurring &quot;Peace&quot; theme. Ascending guitar patterns drive the instrumentals &quot;Level Five&quot; and &quot;Elektrik&quot; a la &quot;Larks Tongues in Aspic Part II&quot; and &quot;Fractured.&quot; &quot;The Power to Believe Part II&quot; begins with exotic percussion reminiscent of &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; and &quot;The Sheltering Sky,&quot; then segues into a vibraphone section that recalls the introduction to &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part I.&quot; &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; updates the &quot;Bolero&quot; rhythm of &quot;The Devil's Triangle&quot; for the electronic age. <br />The major difference between the newer songs and their older counterparts is that atmospheric development has largely supplanted dynamic catharsis.  The continued integration of Robert Fripp's &quot;Soundscapes&quot; and Pat Mastelotto's aggressive drumming into the Crimson sound - as well as spatial sonics vastly superior to any Crimso release - prevent these tracks from merely rehashing past glories.<br />Despite considerable references to their past, Crimso aren't quite ready for the  (oyster soup kitchen floor) wax museum yet.  They lay down a sinuous and hypnotic groove on &quot;Eyes Wide Open,&quot; arguably the most immediately appealing Crimson song since &quot;Matte Kudesai.&quot;  On &quot;Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;Happy With What You Have to be Happy With,&quot; Crimson rocks out with the aggressiveness of bands half their age.  Adrian Belew's trademark lunacy sets these songs apart from the mainstream - although this isn't always a good thing. &quot;Facts of Life&quot; features grating vocals and some unfortunate lyrical choices (&quot;6 million ants&quot;?).  And while &quot;Happy With What You Have to be Happy With&quot; has a remarkably infectious chorus, its meta-lyrics (&quot;And when I have some words  ... I'm gonna have to write a chorus&quot;) come across more as cop-out than commentary.<br />This is an impressive addition to the Crimson oeuvre.  The recent departure of stick player Trey Gunn marks &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; as this lineup's swan song- not a bad way to go out at all.
B00005JMCW|4.0|See Bret Fetzer's editorial review for a right-on capsule analysis.  I wish to add high praise for the surprisingly versatile Lohan, who shows potential star quality here, for it is largely her performance that lifts this movie well above average--though Jamie Lee Curtis and writers Heather Hach, Leslie Dixon, and Mary Rodgers certainly share the credit.
B000000W8C|5.0|If you know of the Verve as the &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; song and the Urban Hymns album, then you're definitely missing out on what the Verve is all about. A Northern Soul is in many ways, even better than Urban Hymns. Soul hads a slightly harder sound, with songs like &quot;A New Decade&quot;,&quot;This is Music&quot;, the title track &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, and &quot;No Knock on My Door&quot;. But the album also contains ballads like the excellent &quot;On Your Own&quot; and &quot;So It Goes&quot;. It also contains a song that sounds a lot a track from Urban Hymns, which is &quot;History&quot;. It also contains a few songs that sound a lot like A Storm in Heaven, their debut album, these being &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot;, &quot;Life's An Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Drive You Home&quot; All in all, the album has the right balance of sound, and at times, it's simply amazing. The album does have a weak song or two, one of which is &quot;Drive You Home&quot; But one of the best things I like about this album is being able to understand most of the lyrics. In their previous albums, the lyrics are echoed out and tough to hear, but A Northern Soul is much better, with Richard Ashcroft's lyrics coming to the front of the music.

The sappy hero/ione song, the impressively detailed animation, the memorable sidekicks (whether it's the dwarfs or the animals) - every subsequent Disney film ever since features some, if not all, of these elements. But of-course, it's nothing to whine about, since it's obviously a winning formula that still works, even if &quot;Snow White&quot;, concept-wise, may look dated today to some. It's no wonder why this film was such a big deal back in 1937. Snow White is a pretty and lovable heroine; the dwarfs - great sidekicks, although I would have preferred less screen time for them; the wicked queen is probably one of the best Disney villains to grace the screen, she's strikingly beautiful yet can look so evil and ugly. The animation is top-notch. You really sense all the effort the animators put into it and the closing shot of Prince Charming's castle is breathtaking. The music in the film is magnificent, with such favorite tunes as &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; and &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot;. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is regarded as one of the finest films ever made, and rightly so. With this brilliant DVD release, you can experience it like never before!
B000002C25|4.0|Be here now is a wonderful CD which has great songs and beat. Its a wonderful Cd which makes a great gift. And, for some xtra trivia for you... In the song Fade In-Out, playing lead-slide guitar is ..... Johnny Depp! WOW !
B000002KDG|5.0|do not listen to anything this person says.  he really thinks Def Leppard coined the phrase, &quot;it is better to burn up, than to fade away.&quot;  Da peace dogg is a joker and unfortunately has too much time on his hands putting out lame azz comments on excellent albums.
B0001AP12G|5.0|HOT! This CD is hot. If you haven't got it, get it. It is worth the money. The ONLY negative is he has a lot of skits but 21 tracks. My favorite tracks are #2,3,4,8,9,10,11,12,15,19,20,21. Out of all the CD's I have this is by far my favorite. Don't be cheap and get the bootleg CD, Get the real one and support K. West. This CD is really hype and if you like Kanye's old work you will love his new work:The College Dropout.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is great for both children and adults.  A great family film.  I watch it often and I don't even have children.  It is a definite buyer and you will have no regrets.  The characters are all very good and each one has their own story.  It is a wonderful movie.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was horrible.  It is totally undeserving of all the attention the critics have been giving it.  It wass incredibly slow pace, and lacked an interesting plot.  If you're one of those intellectual elitist, this movie might give you more &quot;bragging rights&quot; next time you're smoking a pipe and chastising everybody else for their lack of &quot;culture.&quot;<br />Basic rundown of the plot:  Two Americans are bored in Japan.<BR>I guess you can really come to identify with the characters.  I guarantee you'll be bored too.<br />I usually compare movies like this to the parable of the Emperor's New Clothes.  Critics watch the movie and see absolutely nothing of value in it.  Somebody plants the idea in their head that they don't see anything because they're stupid (when in reality, it's just not there).  So then the critics write great reviews, and all the elitists out there are too afraid to disagree.<br />If you're capable of forming your own opinion on a subject, you probably won't like this movie so I advise you not to watch it.
0385504209|3.0|This book was purely escape literature.  To read a really good book or three with true literary value, try The Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables (unabridged), and Pontius Pilate by Paul Maier.  The latter two dealing with real historical facts to support the story. To all those who believe everything they read... the character development was poorly done, the language was elementary, and the \\"historical facts\\" were horribly erroneous.  Dan Brown took SO much artistic lisence with history that it caused his \\"facts\\" to be almost void of historical basis. And just for all those who are wondering, because I havn't heard in mentioned, the gospel of Mary Magdalene, gospel of Thomas, etc. comes from the Apocrapha, an authentic ancient record that was unearthed in the 1800's, but which dates around 110 A.D.(the heart of the apostasy), which means we at least know that they were not penned by these authors. Therefore, they may or may not be accurate to the authors intents. As a student of the arts and religion i've done my share of research. Reasearch is an interesting thing.  You can usually prove both sides of a story with stats and research.  Does that make both sides of the story true?  No. Truth needs no believers.  It will exist without them.  I could take an intellectual and subjective point of view for my review on this book, but why should I?  I AM a religious person and am not by any means ashamed of it nor do I tremble at the so called \\"intellect\\" of the world.  God is Truth and there wasn't much of God in this book.  I'll give it credit for giving easily swayed folks somthing to stress about and being a good read for escape literature.  I also found this book to be both a struggling attempt at another view point and a mockery to intelligent and or faithful Christians.  So the question is, when you read this book will you allow yourself to be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine? There is One who knows all truth, and I can gaurantee you, it's not Dan Brown.own.
0385504209|5.0|OK, so the book has its share of laughably bad writing, and you can spot the cliffhangers a mile away (here comes the end of the chapter -- cue the ominous music!). But the brilliant thing about this book is that the plot almost doesn't matter. The Da Vinci Code is a Trojan horse. Critics may quibble over this or that assertion, but wrapped inside the plot are many truths about the Church's manipulation of the Bible for its own purposes -- truths the Church has labored for millenia to supress. Now they're coming out in this made-for-Hollywood potboiler that's selling millions and headed for the big screen. The horse is out of the barn -- no wonder so many fundamentalists are so upset. So much for the Inquisition. To those who are up in arms, the author and the publisher have the perfect response: &quot;Oh, relax, it's *just a novel!*&quot;
1558908382|5.0|This is an excellent movie. It may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, you will probably like this movie. There is enough action, drama and comedy to keep your attention. What is the big attraction, though, is getting inside the lives and minds of the people. The acting is very good, the sound is good, cinematography is good (for an urban setting). Overall, excellent.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Shame, really; while Hybrid Theory was a nice album, appearing onto a still-fresh music scene and selling quite a few copies at the same time, Meteora is, for all intents and purposes, a rehash of the group's debut.<br />While the music is still good, it is essentially more of the same, which I can't recommend. Much, much more was expected from the follow-up album that simply isn't present on this CD.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I enjoy this movie. Not perfect, but didn't think it would be. I'm not into the nerd thing of picking on every little thing and listing it off, but I wanted to be entertained and this movie did that. Typical superhero stuff with some twists.
B0001AP12G|4.0|So far this has got to be the best cd of 2004. Kanye West spits some hot ryhmes and his beats are hard to resist. There are a lot of skits at the end which kinda slow down the tempo and flow of the cd but still definitely a great cd. A lot of the songs are reflective and personal. Not really hardcore gangsta but u feel the beats and the lyrics.  My favorite songs are: Through the Wire, Slow Jamz, Never Let Me Down (with Jay-Z), and Jesus Walks. <br />Definitley get this cd!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This CD is an excellent addition to all soundtrack collectors weather you are a fan of Church\Christ. The music is so deep and emotional, you feel like you are standing right there when these things happened to Jesus. Especially #11 Crusifiction. That I think is one of the best songs on the CD. Its about 7 minutes long.  In closing the whole CD is excellent, and so is the movie. If you havent seen the movie, see it at least once and you'll understand the music more better. I give props to JOhn Debney for such an excellent score. He's copied no ones work, so ignore the other reviews and take my word. Excellent CD. Get it before its gone.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|OK, first, a confession.  Up until a few weeks ago, I HATED the Beatles!!!  I'd always viewed them as a bubble-gum pop band that ruined rock &amp; roll.  But then, when I decided to be adventurous and check out some CD recommendations from a friend, I heard the Revolver album, and Sgt. Pepper's.  And just like that, I was a Beatles fan!  So when I went over to a local retailer and picked up this, my very first Beatles CD (I should have bought it here, it's three bucks cheaper!), I was really surprised to find that this music is truly, unforgettably catchy, containing some of the most infectious hooks and undeniable melodies to ever come from the sixties.  The sound on this disc is amazing, and I found myself realizing how truly amazing their group harmonies were.  Just listen to &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; or &quot;Help!&quot;  These guys really had a flawless collective ear for melody and texture.  And in '65-'66, when their music became less about groovy hooks and schmaltzy harmonies, and more about trippy lyrics and progressive melodic experimentation, the music got even BETTER!!!  I can't believe how one group could accomplish so much musically when they were only together for seven or eight years.  This CD contains some GREAT material, and I know that they only assembled the #1's here, but I would have loved to hear some of my personal favorites put on here that they somehow neglected, like &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, &quot;Taxman&quot; or &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot;.  Why aren't there any really THOROUGH Beatles compilations out there?  I think they should release all of their original albums together, packaged two to a disc, now that you can fit almost 80 minutes of music on one source.  I'd love to buy individual albums, but with a running time of only 30-45 minutes apiece (excluding the White Album, of course) it seems like a waste of disc space.  And I'd love to see more of their later stuff focused on in future compilations.  But all in all, an AWESOME starter disc for a new budding Beatlemaniac such as myself!
B00005YU1O|4.0|Waking Life is a movie that will make you think. If you want to have an interesting conversation watch this movie. You need to have a large attention span. If you do not at least there are little things they added that can keep your attention. The movie starts out interesting and starts to get boring.  It gets more interesting in the end. Its a very artsy movie so you need to have a sophisticated taste. If you have severe motion sickness I sugest you do not watch this.
6305079811|4.0|This is not your highest quality script or acting but so what, who cares, it is never boring. The movies is fast action from start to finish and the special effects are pretty dam good for 1980. Furthermore, the costumes and sets are like no other sci-fi movie ever, and the Queen soundtrack is awesome. Plus the princess Aura chick is super hot. So if you like sci-fi movies and haven't seen it, you got to check it out.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I read the book a couple of years ago.  When I saw it had been made into a musical, I was curious.  The songs and performers are lively and entertaining.  My only complaint is the songs don't seem to follow the book.  I know they'd have to modify and simplify the story, but I can't figure the changes.  A small libretto would be a great assist.
B000000H4V|1.0|This album is the definitive moment in Sepultura's fast decline to mediocrity.  Of course many will oppose my view and say that Sepultura has progressed into &quot;new ground&quot;. Whatever. Sepultura sounds horrible now. No more speed. No more articulate fretwork. No depth. No more care. The lyrics are generally stupid and sound like something written for a highschool scrapbook. Dumb rhymes, dumb choruses, and dumb concepts. I sold my album. Be careful what you buy.
B00013F38K|4.0|Original composition matters more than aspect ratio.  The reviewer who wrote that widescreen films are shot on full-frame stock is correct.  However, if the director composed his story in widescreen then that is how the story is intended to be viewed.  For example, in the film A Fish Called Wanda, there is a scene in which the character played by John Cleese is supposedly running around an apartment naked.  This film is composed in widescreen.  When you view the film full-frame, the way it is originally shot(as opposed to composed), you see he is sometimes wearing shorts.  When they show this film on tv, they actually crop from the way it was composed(widescreen), so you get much less than you could or should be seeing.<br />In regard to Kung-Fu, this widescreen version has two possibilities.  One is that they cropped from the way it was orinally shot(full-frame).  This is bad if it was composed by the director in full-frame.  And even if the director originally composed Kung Fu in widescreen, you would still get a cropped version of what you saw on tv.  The second possibility is that Kung Fu was originally composed in widescreen.  Then, they cropped from the widescreen to get a full-frame picture to show it on television.  Then, to make this version, they restored it to widescreen.  If this is the case, you would actually see more than what you did on the tv version.  However, this scenario is extremely unlikely.  The chances are that this new version is a cropped one of the tv version.  <br />When this dvd is released, I hope those of you with the tv tapes will let the rest of us know what the difference in versions is.
0385504209|1.0|Many reveiwers have taken the time to explain the historical inaccuracies of this book and his poor writing.  Fine.  His poor research aside, even if this is called &quot;fiction&quot;, the bottom-line is that so many ARE TAKING IT AS FACT.  Some even go so far as to say &quot;religion is debunked.&quot;  Come on!  This is a novel, not a treatise and should be considered as such.
B000002KMV|5.0|This album contains the song that made me notice and respect Prince.  I saw the video for Controversy on Casey's Top Ten Countdown video show.  I was intrigued by the bikini-clad man of color wearing a raincoat and surrounded by stained glass windows.  It was funky.  It was punk.  I did not buy the album until after 1999 or maybe it was after Purple Rain, but this album rocks.  The title track includes the Lord's Prayer, recited as monotone as it is done weekly in churches all over the USA.  It is very romantic, Do Me Baby (eventually covered by Mel'issa Morgan), and very political, Annie Christian and Ronnie Talk to Russia.  It makes you dance: Let's Work (sounds like it was written for a Time album).  It's fun: Jack U Off, Private Joy (didn't LaToya Jackson cover that song?).  Parts of \\"Sexuality\\" pop up on Rainbow Children.  If you like Prince, you have to own this.
B000089RVX|1.0|This album has some good arrangements however, how can one take any band with a dj or back up singer seriously. The &quot;Bring Me...&quot; song is really disturbing in that the band could have done such a good job without the stupid male rapper vocals. Also, the lyrics are so highschool. There is no depth. Amy needs to read more books and develop her vocabulary. She does have a beautiful voice. This could be a good band and I am glad to hear that the guitarist Ben something is leaving. His solos are trite and his playing is redundant.
B00000DC10|5.0|It makes me mad that i didn't know about this album sooner!! This is an unbelievable album mixing techno, punk, and screamo. I recommend this album to anybody that loves good hardcore music!
0385504209|2.0|I have to say, although Dan Brown has an interesting web of trivia thrown into a loosely created plot, it does not make for good reading or literature. What it makes is Dan Brown a very wealthy man!!!! Go for the big bucks Dan! Just like Danielle Steele and Stephen King - quite a sell-out, really. Just toss the Davinci Code into your magazine rack along with your Pottery Barn Catalogue.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|When a group is as universally loved as The Beatles are, there is bound to be some outcry over the \\"purist\\" fans when the surviving members release a re-interpretation of a classic album some 33 years on.  People may quibble about historical accuracy and artistic intention, and the controversy between Let It Be and Let It Be...Naked will continue for quite some time, I'm sure.  However, it all seems a bit misguided and silly.  The Beatles, are, after all, only a rock and roll band-one that had tremendous artistic, cultural, and social impact to be sure, but still, a rock band.  That was all they were, all they really claimed to be: \\"a great little rock and roll band\\".  Get Back/Let It Be was designed to find the Beatles literally getting back to that idea after 3+ years of experimentation, complex arrangements, overdubs and psychedellia.  As we all know, the group splintered apart and the project turned out to essentially be the death knell.  Spector was brought in to salvage the tapes and turned out a record that contained some brilliant moments and also some ill-advised, overproduced ones.  Spector's Let It Be is uneven: great rock songs sit aside horrendously overproduced tracks, and there is no unity or spark to the album as a whole.  Let It Be...Naked changes that.  It sounds like the Beatles getting back.  You can hear their enjoyment in playing live rock and roll with each other--it's the closest they got to recapturing \\"Please Please Me\\" days.  The stripped down production captures the beauty of the slow songs that were smothered in the Spector version (\\"Across The Universe\\" is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity).  The live tracks are relatively unchanged, which is good, and there's a great sequence in the middle of the record from the rooftop show.  Admittedly this is not the group's best work (then again, anything would suffer from comparision to the White Album and Abbey Road), but it is a solid release and worth any Beatle fan's purchase.  The music is exhiliratingly beautiful, like Abbey Road, and the bittersweetness of closing with the \\"naked\\" version of Let It Be is wonderful.<BR>Ignore those who tell you this is not what the Beatles intended--the Beatles didn't know what they intended: that's why there IS such a debacle over this album.  Were the Beatles still a functional group, like they were in 1966-7, this wouldn't even be an issue.  Furthermore, they are not a museum piece.  Pop music is not put on a display case, it is the medium of daily life.  Let It Be (original) still exists for those conservative \\"purists\\" who want it simply because they're used to it.  In the end, it's a matter of taste, and feeling.  This is in abundance on the naked version of the album.
0452282152|5.0|\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" is nothing short of brilliant.  I was compelled to read it--I couldn't put it down, and read it in two days.  Ms. Chevalier has woven a tale, based on speculation, that is not only fascinating and beautiful--but also entirely plausible.  The author's subtle use of color and light to lead us to an understanding of the title character's inner conflict; burgeoning sexuality; and spiritual struggle (in the wake of this newly-aroused sexuality) is as delicate as Griet herself--and as passive-aggressive-forceful as VerMeer.  This is an amazing read--I want to give a copy to everyone I know.
0811806405|5.0|I built my first guitar using The Cumpiano/Natleson Book and am currently finishing my 5th guitar.   I have read other books, read articles by other luthiers and devoured Luthier Journals.  There is nothing that comes close to a definitive, no nonsense approach to the art of guitar building.  I have found that there is a tremendous amount of myth and misinformation on the market and some of it is promoted by guitar magazines, professional musicians and amatuer luthiers.   What Cumpiano presents in his book is the result of 30 years of experience. He knows what works and what doesn't.    If you want conjecture on how to change sound, tap tones, sound hole size and a lot of other misconceptions you won't get it from William or his book.  What you will get is a well described plan to building a great guitar-  A plan based on knowledge and experience- not conjecture.  I highly recommend this book.   They wrote the book because there was nothing out there and a definite need.   I am very grateful they took on such a formidable task.  I was inspired enough by Williams book to take his excellent class.  Check out his web. site.
0446608955|5.0|OMG this book is soooo awesome. i went to my local Border's to browse and i found this lying on the shelf in the young adult section. i couldn't put it down, and it took me about an hour 1/2 to read. i smiled, laughed, and cried. In the prolouge, it says- &quot;First you'll smile, and then you'll cry- don't say you haven't been warned.&quot; Yes, even the toughest of guys will feel their heart break at the end of this wonderul, heartfelt novel about true love. Believe me, you WILL cry. it's soooo sad at the end when...... well won't give it away, but who hasn't seen the movie (me) well i've heard mixed reviews bout the Shane West/ Mandy Moore movie. hope its as good as the book.....<BR>READ IT!!!!!!
0061015725|3.0|**minor spoilers**<br />Convergence of hot technologies!  This is what Crichton does best and I was pleased to see him returning to his sci-fi-thriller writing after reading the entertaining but rather pseudo-scientific Timeline.  <br />This time Crichton deals primarily with nanotechnology.  What if humans were able to build tiny, dust-sized robots?  That could fly?  That were solar-powered?  That could reproduce?  That could evolve?  Okay, so there are some leaps of faith, but the reading is nevertheless enjoyable, and Crichton's easy, fluid writing always insures that the common man will never be lost in techno babble.<br />Unfortunately, the interesting premise and engaging plot can only dissappoint.  There are countless typical Crichton plot devices.  What if the technology gets out of control?  What if the one thing we need is OUTSIDE IN THE SHED??  What if we are presented with several generic characters who are probably movie-fodder for grisly deaths?<br />The last one hundred pages or so are pretty silly; the book begins to take a B-movie twist, switching from predictable to cliche.  Also, the last three pages of the book consist almost entirely of tying up loose-ends and explaining plot holes.  It seems like sloppy writing, almost as if he got sick of writing the book and decided to quickly wrap it up. <br />Crichton's characterization has come a long way since Jurassic Park.  His usual team of experts is not as clear cut and hand picked.  Instead of the scientist, the lawyer, the businessman, and the mathmetician, we simply have a group of scientists with varying backgrounds.  AND fortunately there are no annoying child geniuses who act like idiots.<br />All in all, Crichton is a skilled storyteller and the book is a thrill to read.  I devoured it within barely 24 hours.  What makes the book even more amusing is the knowledge that Crichton recently went through a painful divorce himself.  IMO, it was pretty clear that the character Julia was a stab at hisex, and the main character's voice was his own bitter cynicism following the ordeal.
B0001ADB8C|4.0|A few words are in order concerning this  brand spanking new  George Harrison box set .  This is a lovely package with a large green Dark Horse Records logo splashed on the outer box  (unfortunately, to have this on prime viewing  display  could mean setting the box with its lid on the bottom, perhaps not the best design).  Inside are  all the Harrison albums  issued from 1976 to 1992 -- 33 1/3, George Harrison, Somewhere in England, Gone Troppo, Cloud Nine, and Live in Japan -- in their original formats plus bonus tracks, with custom Dark Horse labels and some new liner notes appended to the original packaging (now reduced for CD format, obviously).  All have been wonderfully remastered along the lines of the All Things Must Pass set from three or four years ago.  Also included with this box set and not available separately is a DVD that includes documentary interview clips, Dark Horse promotional material, the official videos to most of Harrison's singles from this era (with a few MIA),  film clips and rare videos from the  ill-fated \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" film project (this spawned some of Harrison's most whimsical and eccentric tunes -- the title track, Hong Kong Blues, Breath Away from Heaven, Hottest Gong in Town, and some others), and some performances from the Live in Japan concert video (with Eric Clapton).<br />It's a great set for anyone looking to complete or augment their solo Hari Georgeson collection.  I had never owned any of these items before on CD, so the crisp new remasterings are a welcome upgrade over my old vinyl records.  I have always been of the opinion that most of the solo Beatles records were badly produced in the first place, particularly George and John's work, so the recent  remastered reissues of their old albums have been a welcome rediscovery -- many songs that I little regarded I now find much more interesting and enjoyable, with the music more distinct.  Lots of subtle touches stand out that before were lost in muddy mixes and poor-quality pressings.  These still don't have the crack and energy of the best of the music of this period (nothing as dynamic, potent, or surprising as what  punk or New Wave  was generating, obviously), but at least they're notably improved.<br />I had forgotten how \\"Seventies\\" 33 1/3 sounded --  overly busy horn sections, quasi-funk overtones,  schmaltzy strings and choirs  -- but as the albums progress, George gradually gets back to the basics and finds a leaner, cleaner sound.  The guitar playing throughout is exquisite, as you would expect.  There are plenty of lost gems to be found and I stand to gain a renewed appreciation for the Mystical One's solo work through this set and the upcoming re-releases of his Apple albums.  These certainly stand out as warm,  intelligent, and well-crafted records by today's pop standards and remind us of what we have lost from his passing.  Om shanti om.poor-quality pressings.

B000002IST|1.0|How does a band go from an album like 'Wind and Wuthering' to this pap.  The songs on this CD are Collins-formula excrement.  What happened to Tony Banks' integrity I'll never know.  I hope he realizes that he is now a Pariah amongst original Genesis fans.  Collins gets a pass, since he's just the drummer (and an amazingly good one at that, though you'd never know unless you went all the way back to Brand X), but Banks was THE songwriter.  Change is not bad, per se, and good musicians try to always explore new ground - but new ground, this ain't.  Take a lesson from Bruford, a truly great musician who ventures into unexplored territory with every project.
B00005ATQF|5.0|if it weren't for the fact that this actually is THE best war movie ever made it would be worthwhile discussing nothing but the fact that this movie is the exact opposite of Platoon, the one that won all the awards, and the one that happens to suck.  where platoon was choreographed nonsense, this is unbelievably intense human drama.  it may be a movie, but it sure feels real.<BR>platoon bit.  <BR>this is the real thing.<BR>like Tombstone (great) vs wyatt earp (just not good), or Armageddon (very entertaining, if a bit sci-fi silly) vs deep impact (moronic), this is not simply the better of the two, this is GREAT.<BR>and the sound track is excellent.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is for Tobi O and that ignorant comment you made. You fail to realize that nas made illmatic in the early 90's when they were still using old school beats, and it wasn't until 96 when the beat production started shifting towards the beats you hear now. Also you have to give nas alot of credit for this album, because he was only 20 years old, he only had one geust appearance on the album (AZ), finally for his first album he was very lyrically precise, people still listen to this album today which means it's a classic. No one today has yet to match illmatic on a lyrical scale. The only rappers who can are nas himself, tupac, KRS-ONE, blackthought, and RZA.
B0000DJZB9|3.0|Oh we remember it well, the day 'Appetite for Destruction' was released. Everyone everywhere thought Guns n Roses would be long lasting like Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones. We can only look back now and laugh (or cry). For a band that had so much potential, everything went wrong. They were possibly the last band that had a shot of having a thirty year career. This DVD shows all the videos this band made during their all too brief existance.<br />The problem is, the videos are in chronological order. Is this a bad thing? For Guns n Roses it is. When a band releases a debut album that they can never live up to, and you see rotating band members, and Axl getting sillier and weirder, the interest in this collection wanes as the songs go on.<br />The first three, Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Paradise City show the classic lineup, the best the band ever had to offer. Then we get Patience. An accustic number that Guns released to appease fans that were anxiously waiting for 'Appetite II&quot;. Well from here on out we get the Illusion videos. New drummer (what is he like 50 years old?), new guitar player, keyboardist (who the hell are these people?) Anyway, for what it's worth, you can watch a band explode onto the rock scene and then go out with a whimper.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I've only read the latest two reviews before feeling the urge to put finger to key. Some aspects of this film have been covered to death so I'll try to avoid them, and just stick in the stuff that people seem to miss or misinterpret.<br />The last reviewer suggested that the film suffers from being directionless, which is exactly the same reaction I got from a friend of mine. The film isn't plot-driven, and isn't meant to be. The approach is almost documentary-style. What you see is a series of choice scenes, probably edited from three times as much footage (I read in an interview that the script was only 75 pages long and much of the film was improvised). It seems that Coppola gave the characters to the actors and let them explore the themes of the film.<br />Which brings me to the second point. Two reviews down someone says there's nothing to think about, quite an astonishing criticism given on how many levels the film explores the themes of it's title. Many cliches are turned on their heads in this film, not least the mid-life crisis theme. The title alone cuts the cliche down to size, exploring how in Bob's (Murray) life things have literally been 'lost in translation'. Even with his (now dwindling) success over the decades, his expectations of life have not been met. Something has been lost. These themes are much explored in Ozu's masterpiece Tokyo Story too, a film that Lost In Translation's detractor's would no doubt abhor, as adored as it is. Bob is also the end-result of a character at the other end of life, Charlotte (Johannson), who having just married a workaholic photographer, is beginning to see exactly how life will turn out. These themes of what so many of us lose out on in life are the main crux of the film, and the most compelling and profound. But the title has other meanings. We see Charlotte exploring Japanese history alone, and is left cold by the beautiful temples and feels distant from the traditional Japanese weddings. Not only is this because she has no-one to share these moments with, but it's also the oh-so familiar tourist feeling of going all the way to see something that you know you should be excited about, only to have the reality let you down for no apparent reason. The idea of these attractions often are the attraction, but the reality often loses something in translation.<br />On another level, the film explores the translation (as in change of co-ordinates) of people from one culture to another, and here the film has been accused of racism or stereotyping. Stereotypes are indeed invoked, but along with the mixed up 'r's and 'l's there's an American actress thanking someone for thinking she was aneorexic. The kneejerk reactions to these rely on double standards and are not to be taken seriously. Coppola obviously has great fondness for Tokyo, but is as willing to criticise and indeed poke fun as she is to make ode to.<br />As well as people being translated between cultures, the translation of cultural phenomena between cultures is explored. An insane talk show shows how the Graham Norton formula doesn't work everywhere, and that's a real show!<br />So there is plenty to think about (and talk about judging the length of this review), it's not racist and it doesn't rely in the slightest on narrative drive or character arcs (what would McKee think?). It is a beautiful, beautifully judged film about realising the limitations of most lives, and getting through one week of it with someone who is a stranger but you still recognise. There is a definite duality here, a contradiction of how disappointing and yet how exciting life is, evoked most explicitly when the wonderful Bill Murray turns another cliche on its head by giving the obligatory speech about how wonderful it is to have children and at the same time inferring that this is also a loss.
0385504209|3.0|Wow, that was painful.  This book had such high aclaim, I felt obligated to finish it, assuming that it would eventally get better.  I admit the beginning of this novel was intriguing, but there was just too many details about the Bible and the lost pages.  After having to read Brown repeat himself about the keystone over and over, I felt like I was going through a slow death.  The reason why I gave three stars was for the character development.  I enjoyed the individual characters (with the exception of Sophie--who was flat) and their independent personalities.
B00006RU5B|5.0|As a serious music fan who starves for a somewhat recent past and tires of the same trendy crap that dominates (atleast most of) the radio today, this group struck a new nerve with me and it's still sore! A fan of both Rage... and Soundgarden, I have to admit this combination gets my better vote over both! The creative and memorable vocal lines of Chris Cornell contrast beautifully with the simple yet effective grooves of Rage's former musicians. The entire album is a winner, packed with complex emotions and stunning lyrics. The only, and I mean ONLY drawback is that some of the songs sound sort of the same towards the end, but this does not affect the overall appeal of the album. Wow-something NEW that doesn't suck!
0385510438|4.0|William Traynor, a 23 year old, takes over a small Southern<BR>town's newspaper with some financial help from a rich relative.<BR>A brutal rape/murder by a member of a feared family who has previously been above the law begins a chain of events that lead William to some dangerous circumstances.  William learns of Miss<BR>Callie Ruffin, a black woman who has put 11 of her 12 children through college.  Some of my favorite moments are when William visits Callie once a week and savors her wonderful home-cooked meals, the likes of which he has not experienced before.  Miss<BR>Callie becomes the first black juror in the town's history against the accused murderer.  A trial ensues, a verdict rendered, etc.  However, the strength of this novel is not the<BR>courtroom scenes, but the depiction of William's strength as a<BR>journalist and his relationship with Miss Callie.  The book is<BR>more &quot;The Painted House&quot; than &quot;The Runaway Jury.&quot;<BR>   My favorite Grisham remains today &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot;  Very moving.
B00018D3RI|5.0|If you loved this show. This DVD is a must have. I loved this show as a kid. The first season was the best.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I thought the whole idea of mother and daughter switching bodies was so out-dated and so redundant that I almost skipped watching the movie with my sister and younger brother, but I was surprisngly wrong and I have not laughed this hard and enjoyed a romantic comdey this much in a LONG LONG time!!!<br />The whole plot(which was first introduced in the '70s) was executed in such a clever, interesting, and unpredictable way, I forgot I was seeing a mother and daughter body switch movie and just enjoyed the hilarious performances by both actresses and endearing, real qualities that both evoked towards the audience.<br />A must see for the whole family, ENJOY!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I loved this movie!  I have experienced love like that and it was good to see it on film.  My husband and I loved each other at first sight and it was perfect.  He went to Iraq and it was the hardest thing I've ever been through, not knowing if he would come home to me.  This movie touched my heart, reminded me of new love, and made me appreciate even more that my husband came home safe.  I can't wait for the DVD.
B0000029AP|5.0|The distillation of everything that was loud, exciting, and fun about Rock in the '70's, and a continuing testimony to how to do it correctly. An absolutely indispensable record for anyone who cares about Rock in any way, shape, or form.<br />The boys start out loud and fast on the title cut, a tune so ferocious it scared me the first time I heard it. They then seamlessly move into &quot;Uncle Salty&quot;, the beautiful and melancholy exploration of abuse.<br />In case anyone thought the boys were getting too serious, there follows the raunchy word play and hard-driving &quot;Adam's Apple&quot;, the mega-single (and catchy as the flu) &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. And a wild novelty which took me years to grow to LOVE (&quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot;).<br />&quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; starts side 2 (this is how vinyl records worked, kids, grooves on either side of a plastic &quot;pizza&quot;), with probably the coolest song in Aero history, and a tune still heard at the movies, whenever they need to show cool '70's music, instead of disco. &quot;No More, No More&quot; showed how a piano could be cool, in a driving rock song, while &quot;Round and Round&quot; was simply hypnotic. (Try it while watching your vinyl LP actually turning Round and Round and Round and Round and...., you get the idea.) The less said about &quot;You See Me Crying&quot;, the better, I suppose. No, really, it was a power ballad before anyone had a term for it, and better than virtually any that followed, but then, it WAS Aero, ya know?<br />The FIRST record I bought and still fresh as the day I slapped it on the platter.<br />Good stuff!
B000031WD8|5.0|'American Pie' is one of the greatest things ever to come out of the other side of the pond. Though I'm not sure it has the same following on this side of the Atlantic I am certainly one of the series biggest fans and it's easy to see why. An incredibly funny flick from start to finish and great performances from Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott and Eugene Levy who have become my favourite actors as a result of this fab trilogy. A must see
1400031362|3.0|These Ladies Detective Agency novels are entertaining but there are much better books out there.  If you need something to read for a break from harder novels I recommend this book and the others in the series.  But if you are just looking for something to read that challenges you then this novel is not for you.  Secret Life of Bees and The Lovely Bones are much better and entertaining.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is the best series that I have ever seen. Clark is a sexy man and eveeybody should own this series.
B00000IAU3|3.0|Here with Me, Hunter, and Thank You quickly became favorites of mine in listening to No Angel.  All three stand out greatly from the general sound of the songs on this c.d.  While most of Dido's songs are pleasing to listen to, most of them don't really stand out and grab your attention.  A few are downright bad;  Don't think of me is bland, and Honestly Ok seems to be weird for the sake of being weird as it features approximately 1:30 of strange, random instrument noises.  I would definitely say that if you want to be free of the norm of today's music, which seems to be mainly swearing and feral screaming, buy this.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Tom Berenger's Confederate General Longstreet is a superb portrayal, his best work since the near-psychotic sergeant in the otherwise forgettable &quot;Platoon&quot; and not equaled since. It leads the list of excellent portrayals, including Chamberlain by Jeff Daniels, his best work ever (his speech to his unit was done with Civil War recreators from Maine and powerfully affected them and him). Martin Sheen is the wrong actor to do R. E. Lee but this unconvincing portrayal is not a fatal flaw. The acting, even where license is taken with the historical truth, does accurately reflect the people involved in the struggle. While a must-see for Civil War students, anyone interested in history will appreciate this film. The advantage of the DVD is, of course, the lack of interruptions so the viewer gets a better sense of the flow of things.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has a sort of dark, goth, rock appeal that I see nowhere else these days.  They really stand out.  You don't get Slipknot's feral screaming, or Good Charlotte's pre-teen girl lyrics.  I shall break the c.d. down by song for thee.<br />Fallen:  8/10  Heard it so much I've memorized it.  Not as hypnotic as some of the other songs.<br />Bring Me To Life:  9/10  Too short, but one of the best songs on the c.d.  I love the rhythym (is that how it's spelled?) and the lyrics.  Too bad it had to be associated with Daredevil (and if you've heard the original version of the song, that hurts it)<br />Everybody's Fool:  8/10  I think this has good application in our day and age of shallow yutzes, and the lyrics are good.<br />My Immortal:  9/10  A nice relaxing song.  Kinda sorrowful lyrics but nice and meaningful.<br />Haunted:  7/10  Dark, moody.  Deals with a touchy subject.  I don't like it as much, but it's intense, so I still like it.<br />Tourniquet:  7/10  Not so good compared to the rest of the songs.  A bit repetitive.<br />Imaginary:  8/10 The tune of this one is very different from any other song.  A bit slow, but very nice.<br />Taking over me:  6/10  This song is very bland compared to the rest.<br />Hello:  9/10  A slow one, but it's really good.  It's very deep and sorrowful.<br />My Last Breathe:  10/10  This one's kinda sad, but I like it.  Lyrics are nice, and the tune is catchy.<br />Whisper:  15/10 (heh, just had to do that)  While there's a goofy chorus at the end, I really like this one.  It has an intense tune to it.  The lyrics are also incredibly good.<br />Mainly, I like this c.d. because it's so different from what I'm forced to listen to day after day.  It can be sorrowful and deep, touching and sweet, dark and intense, and all of it good.
B00006879E|2.0|The first two songs are good and the rest sucks.  Don't bother buying this one.
B0000C1733|5.0|This is a great cd for a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. This contains tracks like &quot;Give it Away&quot;, &quot;Other Side&quot;, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;. it has 16 tracks, and two of them are brand new. I fyour a RHCP fan you gotta have this. There is a special edition one which contains a dvd with the cd. The dvd has 16 videos on it.
B000001GXI|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with this recording will probably be quite surprised at some of the comments being made by the reviewers... for example that Roberta Peters is singing out of tune.  Being a fairly compitent musician myself I can tell you that she is not singing out of tune, only the tone is harsher than many other queen's.  The thing that these reviewers also miss is that this is a very reasonable way to approach the role... the music does not exist for the sheer beauty of it, but rather as a contrast to the Mozartian style.  Coluratura dates back to earlier Italian operas, and it is no coincidence that Mozart composed such a part for his villian, contrasting it with the ultimate force of good, being Sarastro (again, a wonderful performance).  If she sounds cold or harsh, then that's perfect.  Is Roberta Peters a good singer?  No, but she isn't a bad one either; more importantly, she's a dramtically effective Konigin der Nacht, and even if you never wanted to hear her in any other role (and as far as I know, no one has) this role is perfect drama and casting.  Furthermore, Bohm is unquestionably the greatest Mozart conductor of the recorded era (with Krips and Beecham also ranking in).  This recording is a perfect Zauberflote, and I can think of none to recommend more highly.  It's a shame that Bohm seems to be slipping out of popular view.    As for Lear, she is a good soloist, although not a great one, and suffers more from being on a recording with great performers.  The male cast is incredible, and the music is amazing.  A lot of your perspective on the quality of this recording revolves around you insistance on what is important in an opera.  Bohm admitted that he would many times take a performance that the singer wasn't absolutely happy with because it was the best performance overall.  If you go with Solti, Marriner, Gardiner, or any of the other second rate Mozart conductors (no offense against Solti of course, his Wagner is especially great, and he was a fantastic conductor... as for Marriner and Gardiner, if you think that is Mozart...) who happen to have very great singers. Bohm (and Giulini also) come from the perspective that ensemble is what really counts... and it's more important how the orchestra and soloists interact together.  Both conductors consistently get the best performances (I've never heard a bad Giulini recording), but they do not always show off the individual talents (for example, Don Carlos, casting Domingo in a rule that only has one aria).    I have only one serious complaint with this recording, as I do with every studio recording that Bohm made... I know it would have been better live.  Not that it is a bad recording, but as anyone familiar with Bohm will attest to, he was always best in live performances.  In closing I will quote High Fidelity magazine, \\"A testing place for me is the rise of the curtain--Tamino's enterance, with the \\"Listige Schlange\\" in pursuit.  If it is \\"pretty\\" or neat-sounding, we are generally in for a dull time; if we sense the plight of the breathless prince and the presence of the monster in the rushing string figures, there is hope... This is the only recording of Zauberflote that can, on repeated hearings, exert a real dramatic grip and keep the imagination stewing.\\"
1558216847|4.0|The reflections of a Polish cavalry officer during the outset of the Second World War may not strike you as riveting stuff but in this case you would be sadly mistaken.  Reading this book takes you on a journey which tested the physical, emotional and mental limits of the author's endurance.  The free flowing narrative with its perceptive attention for detail draws us into a world of human cruelty and despair and the reader's sense of shock is unnervingly stretched by each turn of the page.  We find ourselves accompanying the author as a young man being found guilty by a 'kangaroo court' in Russia and then being subjected to the vicious and dehumanizing effects of torture.  This however is only the beginning of the beginning as we then stand beside him as he endeavours to survive the awful realities of being hearded across Siberia to a camp designed to accommodate such prisoners.  When many human beings would have simply died or lost the will to carry on, we find in the author and a group of his fellow prisoners an immutable determination not to be extinguished from existance.  What follows is a prison escape which takes 1 year, covers 4000 miles and requires already ill treated men to walk from the artic circle to India with only a few items which the average boy scout would laugh at.  The reader's sense of disbelief is married to utter admiration as the pain, tragedy and misery of such a journey becomes evident.  The author cleverly recreates this journey, from the oven of the Gobi desert to the treacherous Himalayan mountains, in such a way that betrays the fact that your're not actualy there.  You find yourself sharing the groups woes and joys as they struggle against nature to stay alive.  Their enviable determiantion to keep moving forward is echoed in the desire to continue reading which this book engenders.  Well worth a go !
B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing only the first two singles on the radio and it hasn't been out of my CD changer since.  There is not a bad song on the entire album.
B000066NW0|5.0|I LOVE AVRIL LAVIGNE! The first time i heard her song &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio i was like..&quot;Holy s*** this girl has talent!&quot; And i was right. She is herself and doesnt try to change herself now because of the fame. She writes what is on her mind and how she feels or has gone through. i relate to her a lot as do a lot of people and her new single for her 2004 cd &quot;Dont tell me&quot; Is another #1 HITTER! All you haters can suck it cause Avril is on top. And no matter what you say that u think will bring her down, she rubs it off her shoulder cause your not worth her time. If you havent bought this cd..DO SO! YOU WILL NOT BE DISCOURAGED!
B0000560X3|2.0|This was probably my 1st Rock album purchase - I have had 2 LP versions - one worn out, the CD, and now this DVD-A.  No doubt I've listened to it more than any other recording I have.<br />Whoever put this together cared a lot less about Deep Purple.  In fact probably not at all.<br />The mix is marginal at best.. Maybe I'm a Leo has a &quot;new&quot; guitar solo - an out take not nearly as sweet as the original release.  That'd be OK for a bonus track, but I was expecting a good mix of the original.  Perhaps the original tracks were damaged.  If I can force myself to listen again - I'll try to notice other areas where it sounded like alternate takes were used on other tracks.  No mention of any of this on the liner notes - maybe the re-mix dude didn't even notice.<br />Speaking of packaging and liner notes: lots of writing of band history and a story about the hotel burning, but mostly none of the orignal artwork from the album - and not on the DVD-A either.<br />There are two videos as well - what a waste - terrible audio quality - probably a board mix in mono, the vocal is overpowering everything.  Just when Richie is about to cut loose on Highway Star solo, the video fades and ends?????  Lazy, about halfway thru the guitar solo, the video fades and ends.  Whoopie for this mess.<br />The original Stereo mix may be OK, but I'm not so sure about the re-mastering of it.  Maybe the CD of the Original is best.<br />DVD-A can be a great format, but not done like this.
0783226845|5.0|This is Pacino hyperbole and you're loving every minute of it.  Lt. Col. Frank Slade ranks with Michael Corleone and Tony Montana as Pacino's most memorable (fictional) screen characters (Frank Serpico is in a class all it's own).  This is also an enduring story of friendship:  The bonding between Pacino and Chris O'Donnel's Charlie Sims is heart warming, but never sappy.  Bo Goldman again proves to be a genius with the pen.  Great, great work.  Wish I could have that suite at the Waldorf at the government rate.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|This is one of the worse movies I have seen in some time.  Gore and moody lighting alone do not make a movie worth seeing.  The effects were anything but special.  It also completely ripped off the Matrix in sound and visual effects.  Poorly, too, I might add.  Do not waste your time!
0451457994|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This easy-to-read book (first published in 1968, a year before the first Moon landing) by Sir Arthur C. Clarke is the first installment of his \\"Odyssey\\" series of science fiction novels.  It is divided into six parts: (1) Primeval Night: six chapters (2) TMA-1: eight chapters (3) Between Planets: six chapters (4) Abyss: ten chapters (5) The Moons of Saturn: ten chapters (6) Through the Star Gate: seven chapters.<br /><br />This novel is classified as science fiction but is so much more.  It also has other elements such as the evolution of man, science, astronomy, computer science, extraterrestrial (ET) intelligence, and suspense.<br /><br />Evolution of man is the subject matter of part one of the novel.  Here you'll be introduced to ape-men and how they adapt to their environment.  Two major ape-men introduced are \\"Moon-Watcher\\" and \\"One-Ear.\\"<br /><br />Science is presented throughout the novel.  For example, \\"A man who weighed one hundred eighty pounds on Earth might be delighted to discover that he weighed only thirty pounds on the Moon.  As long as he moved in a straight line at a uniform speed, he felt a wonderful sense of buoyancy.\\"<br /><br />Astronomy is introduced throughout parts two to six.  Overall, Clarke gives good descriptions of our solar system, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, and Saturn.  All these are presented with a sense of wonder.<br /><br />Computer science is represented by the supercomputer HAL (which stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer).  HAL was \\"the nervous system\\" of the Earth-built spacecraft 'Discovery' (which was piloted by astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole).  \\"Without [HAL's] supervision, 'Discovery' would be a mechanical corpse.\\"<br /><br />Extraterrestrial (ET) intelligence is represented by the monoliths.  A monolith is first encountered by the ape-men.  Later, another monolith is encountered on the Moon (where it is called \\"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-One\\" or TMA-1).  It is described as a \\"vertical slab of jet-black material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it [resembled]...a giant tombstone.  Perfectly sharp-edged and symmetrical, it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it; there was no surface detail at all.  It was impossible to tell whether it was made of stone or metal or plastic--or some material altogether unknown to man.\\"  A monolith occurs at two more critical times in the novel.<br /><br />Suspense is created when the astronauts have to go up against space, their own computer, and powers beyond human comprehension (presented in part six of the novel).<br /><br />Numerous examples of nature imitating the art in this book can be found.  For example, consider the saga of Apollo 13 in 1970.  The Command Module, which houses the crew, was called 'Odyssey.'  Just after the explosion that caused the mission to be aborted, one of the astronauts radioed back to Mission Control: \\"Houston, we've had a problem.\\"  The words that HAL said to the novel's astronaut Frank Poole regarding a similar event were: \\"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, but we have a problem.\\"<br /><br />Finally, this novel was written at the same time as the 1968 movie (which has the same title as the novel) was being made.  As a result, there is a close parallel between the book and the movie but there are some major differences.  In my opinion, a major difference is that the movie leaves out many of the explanatory details found in the novel.  Thus, the movie can be difficult to understand.  Therefore, I recommend the following: watch the movie first (to get an idea of its sheer wonder and don't worry about the details), then read the novel (to understand the finer details of the movie), and then watch the movie again (to get a greater understanding of what it is attempting to convey).<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel will present you with a unique, mind-bending experience.  Don't miss this incredible journey!!<br /><br />+++++ical slab of jet-black material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it [resembled]...a giant tombstone.

0140868445|5.0|This book like no other one before it or after it expresses the dire situations that captalism and the endless need for profit that is built into the human psyche can create for our race. Steinbeck, a moderate leftist, portrays a family of &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; migrants as they travel through the Midwest to California, to seek land and new jobs(the banks supported by the government[in many cases being the same thing] pushed millions of people off their land at the time), but when they arrive all they find is people who are so corrupted by money and an endless fear of loss of capital that they do not offer the family any support or aid.<br />  Steinbeck wrote this book as a summation of real events that happened in the 1930's. His book realizes the need for social change in America and the world. It does not make anyone look &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It simply makes the system humanity follows seem like the one tearing us apart. Just one of the things that makes this novel maybe the best one ever written. If only steinbeck was alive today, maybe he'd write a novel or two to take Bush down.
0743455967|5.0|You don't have to be a fan of Stephen King to appreciate this biographical look at the craft of writing.  Love him or hate him, it's hard to argue with his success or deny that the man knows how to tell a story.  He devotes the first part of this book to the story of his childhood and young adulthood, with plenty of trials and hilarity thrown in. He moves on to the craft of writing itself, offering in his words &quot;no bull%@*$&quot; about how to write a story.  He ends with a harrowing look at the accident that almost killed him, along with his own list of favorite books.  If you are an aspiring writer you would be well served to give this book a read.

I dont care what those other people said because if they don't like her music that is O.K. because they can go listen to their CLASSICAL music I personaly almost did buy this because of their response but then I thought who cares what they think? If I like Britneys Music I can buy it  period. If they don't like her music they have no buisness on this site they can go to what ever site they like better because you know what I don't go to pages of singers I don't like and rate them baddley so why should they get to do that? No wait let me guess it's a frekin' free country am I right? I thought so.
B0001I561E|5.0|Seems like years since I last saw Aladdin,it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time,and with past Disney hits like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast,Disney had yet another masterpiece in Aladdin.<br />It's a story about Aladdin,a street rat,growing up in Agrabah,who leads a carefree life until he stumbles upon the Cave of Wonders and frees the Genie from his lamp. He also falls in love with Jasmine,daughter of the sultan of Agrabah. But not all is peaceful,for the vizier Jafar,along with his wisecracking parrot,Iago,plan disaster upon the Sultan,Jasmine and all of Agrabah. It's all typical Disney hilarity and the trademark Disney music that we all fell in love with in Disney's classics.<br />I will be for sure snagging this come October when it's release date arrives.
B00013F35I|4.0|Compared to the New York DVD, which is truly remarkable, the editing, cinematography, lighting, sound mix, and direction are sub par. The cuts are too short, the shots are often uninspired, the lighting, whilst impressive for the audience, has been captured poorly on camera and the sound mix is not crisp enough.<br />As for the direction, well, who was in charge of this set up? If anyone has seen The Last Waltz, director Martin Scorsese ensured he was prepared for every song by storyboarding each lyric (I kid you not). He knew where to place the camera. Here, as seems the case with most concert DVDs, it is Russian roulette with the camera work. Random cuts, a swooping camera shot here, a close up of Springsteen's guitar there, and maybe we'll cut to an E Street member every now and again. For a show by these artists the preparation should be nothing short of exhaustive. I wonder whether this director had even ever listened to one of their albums!<br />But let us not detract from the performance, which puts to shame every show I've been to for years.<br />Springsteen is, as ever, on fire throughout this colourful night in Barcelona. Fleshing out many songs from The Rising, with a near perfect rendition of Mary's Place (my highlight), and truly blistering guitar solos (see World's Apart) we see Bruce and the band enjoying every single moment on stage (although, of course, the shots fail to capture the character of the band as they should have done). Then there are two sublime piano solos at the end of disc one from songs rarely played these days. Bruce is blessed with one of rock's most rich back catalogues and here all era's of his career are put forward for all to see.<br />For fans of Springsteen, this is a given. As for the sound, well, it isn't perfect but it certainly isn't bad. It's better than any soundboard bootleg you've heard (for arenas, that is) but it could have been brighter, with maybe the audience turned down a bit and each band member mixed in a waywhere they are clearly recognisable. The two instruments that sound wonderful however are the violin and Springsteen's many guitars. They seer through the tracks, and are stunning.<br />A special mention should go to the rapturous Barcelona crowd. It's a great venue, and the reception the band got is as good as any on The Rising tour. This shows how powerful Springsteen's music is.<br />The greatest flaw however is shared also by the NY DVD. NO SUBTITLES. Now I know every song on this set inside out, but many do not, and even fans can often mistake lyrics when the mix is this bad. And no fan of Bruce will ever say his singing is always understandable. His lyrics however are just as enjoyable to read as they are to listen to, and for the hard of hearing and deaf I find it absolutely despicable that an artist of Springsteen's stature and popularity has DVDs out there without subtitles. This should be addressed sooner rather than later.<br />Despite these drawbacks it remains a must own, purely for the music. I can simply sit back and accept the flaws, and revel in another milestone in the Boss's illustrious career. But Sony, don't do it again!
B00005B36H|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their opinion i guess, but usually when you bash an album and/or a band you should give examples of bands that you think do deserve some credit and praise. Now, what kind of jerk-off puts Tool and Mainstream in the same sentence? That baffles me. Tool has been in my opinion the most consistently strong band in the past decade. Whether or not you like the band doesnt negate the fact that these guys are anti-mainstream. Take your head out of the sand and broaden your horizons..... With every Tool album you get a calculated, well thought out album that none of the members would put out until it was 100% perfect. Maynard James Keenan has to be the smartest lead man with one of the most unique and powerful voices I have ever heard. This album is not quite as good as Aenima (My absolute favorite album) but comparing it to most crap put out now, it deserves every ounce of credit it has gotten and more. Its just sad not everyone can see the greatness that is the one and only Tool.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I didn't watch \\"The Shield\\" when it was shown on TV its first season, but when Michael Chiklis carted home the Best Actor Emmy for his performance that season, I took notice.  I decided to purchase the first season DVD set and I was hooked!  This is a rare show where I like every single character in the cast.  All of the cast, from Chiklis' Vic Mackey to CCH Pounder's Claudette Wyms to Jay Karnes' Dutch Waggenbach to Cathy Dent's Danny Sofer (and the others I haven't named), all have significant roles in the story and you can sympathize with them all, even when they are not on the up and up (especially Mackey's Strike Team).<br />There isn't a clunker in this 13 episode set.  Highlights include Dutch's obsession with finding a serial killer, the Strike Team's reaction after Mackey kills a cop who he finds out is out to help shut him down and the struggles of rookie cop Julien Lowe (played by Michael Jace) to figure out his sexuality. The chemistry of the various cliques (the Strike Team, Claudette and Dutch, Danny and Julien) makes this show riveting.<br />This is a great DVD set to have as there is cast and crew commentary on every episode.  Just about every actor in the cast makes at least one appearance for commentary and show creator Shawn Ryan is very informative about the various goings on with the show.  Plus they seem to have fun together which probably helps explain the show's success.<br />Season 2 was great as well and I can't wait for Season 3 which heats up soon!
B00000099Y|5.0|i have been reading some reviews about Tool and how some people think they suck. well the reviews were written in an... let me see... uneducated matter? all they had to say was &quot;omg like... this cd like... sucks.&quot; well in my opinion if you werent too busy banging your freakin brains out to slipknot you may be able to understand these sirens of musicians and appreciate them for their music and their art. people these days just want to listen to something that they can head bang to. dont you get tired of that? dont you just want to sit back, relax, and listen to some music that gives you goosebumps its so good? if you do then this cd is for you. and hey! you might even be tapping your foot to it. all the songs on this cd are amazing and put together in a perfect matter. its almost like every song is a baby and they take care and nurture each song to be perfect. that is all.
B00005JLRT|1.0|What can one even say about this thing?  Trekkies are often mocked by people who say that they just want to see special effects, and that character and story mean nothing to them, and this film proves that contention utterly correct.<br />The bad guys are idiots, and I mean knuckle dragging, mouth breathing idiots.  They could ever so easily accomplish their goal of taking over the galaxy, but luckily for Jean Luc Picard, they've got the minds of angst-ridden twelve year olds.  Any time the villain must be reduced to such a sub-human level in order to make the good guy look good in comparison, well, you know you're watching a recent Star Trek film.<br />Even the technology is laughable.  The Remans have a gigantic ship - hundreds of disruptor banks, cloaking device, double shields, etc.  They shoot the Enterprise about 200 times, which causes some sparks to fly on the bridge.  Then the Enterprise returns fire - did I mention that the bad guys' ship has double shieleds, etc?  The Enterprise shoots the bad guys' ship about 3 times and nearly knock it out of action.  Oh c'mon.  That's just infantile.  It reminds me of Janeway shooting the Borg on Voyager.<br />As far as the plot, well, about a third of it was eidted out.  The book is actually quite good, and they edited out all the good parts in favor of special effects shots.  What's left is an inane, typically banal Trek show with cardboard characters, a gazillion bucks of computer effects, and no heart nor soul.<br />Ah, Trek.  Rodenberry once spouted some innane babble about how the show was about people.  What a joke.  Believe me, if you're even tangentially interested in Trek, get Wrath of Khan instead.
0767830555|2.0|After reading and hearing so many good things about this film I was sure it would be a great movie, especially because DeNiros in it. Unfortunatly I ended up being very wrong.The whole movie seemed like it was just a bunch of random junk to make it longer. The so called climax also left much do be desired. Bodies fell in some very cheap slow motion effect, and the whole scene seemed to end very quickly. It left me saying &quot;I watched all of that  for this?&quot; Please take my advice and don't by this movie.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Just in time for the theatrical release is this handsomely packaged 5-CD set of the first season.  It is hard to imagine the movie will measure up to the series, although you can catch a glimpse of the movie in the extras included in this box set.  The series burst on the scene in the mid 70's.  Starsky and Hutch proved an instant hit as an entertaining police odd couple covering the streets of LA in their sporty red Gran Torino.  I was partial to Starsky myself.  Hutch a bit too straight laced, but the two played so well off each other, until success spoiled them in the later seasons.  Huggy was a great comic foil, and you will enjoy the numerous guest appearances in this series.  Interesting to see that Michael Mann wrote two of the early episodes: Texas Longhorn and Lady Blue.  He would later make his mark in Miami Vice.  But to me, Starsky and Hutch remains the best buddy cop show on TV, playing off the various cop movies of the time.  And you just can't beat that Gran Torino!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I also saw this film without knowing anything about it. And I experienced it differently from my husband. He felt that the trailer conveyed a slap-stick comedy. I, on the other hand, sensed something melancholy. I also connected with it on the level of having myself been an American in a ultra-modern, chaotic Asian city, namely Hong Kong.  When I was there, I couldn't wait to leave, but once I left, I couldn't stop reminiscing about it. That's the feeling of this movie.  The environment is an assault on every sense -- from the 24-hour blazing neon, bustling traffic, constant crowds to the over-the-top entertainment spectacles. In the film, as in real life, the experience is overwhelming and exhausting. And the jet-lag doesn't help. Bill and Charlotte never do quite fit in. The effect is a sort of loneliness that hurts while they're experiencing it, but a feeling that connects them, and that they won't soon forget. We know that back home these two would have never had any kind of connection. In a way it's like a war story that unites people through their common tragic experience, but who would otherwise never have connected. My sense is that people who truly get this film don't ponder what Bill whispered in Charlotte's ear. You just know. You can't articulate the words, but you just know.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is one of the best thrillers/whodunits I have ever seen.  Even after I thought I knew what was going on, it still stuck it to me in the end.<br />It was very scary, but not because of the normal slasher movie cliches, but because I had no idea what was going to happen next.  The story is pretty much an updated version of Ten little indians, which is a wonderful whodunit in itself.<br />All of the acting is wonderful.  There is humor just when you need it, but it does not stay around for long.<br />The story follows 11 people as they are thrust into each others lives with out knowing why.  One by one they are murdered and at each murder a room key is left starting with room 10 and going down to 1.  So it is up to them to first find out who is killing them, second why and third what do they all have in common.  The movie cuts back and forth between the motel where the murders are taking place and a courthouse where there is a midnight meeting going on about what is going to happen to a convicted killer.<br />The pace is pretty quick and there is not much downtime.  Once you think you have figured it out a screwdriver is thrown into the spokes of your wheel and you are left right back at the beginning to start over.<br />This is a must see for all thriller/scary movie fans.  Just give in and let it take you for a ride.  You will not be sorry.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|To all who voted with one or two stars, stating that this album was &quot;depressing&quot;, obviously did not listen to the lyrics close enough. Maybe your perception of the world is depressing and that is the way you chose to view it. If you listen to &quot;Perfect Girl&quot;, there is a verse that proves just how powerful she is as a woman and a musician; &quot;Don't worry you will find the answer if you let it go, give yourself some time to falter, but don't forgo knowing you're loved no matter what, and everything will come in time...&quot; It seems to me that the &quot;one starred&quot; people need to try and experience the harsh word of &quot;reality&quot; in a different perspective... Take a bath and relax, let the music lift you up instead of bring you down!
0393317552|1.0|Mr. Diamonds thesis and knowledge of how different environments benefit certain populations is very intriguing. His book is easily the best radical cultural/environmental determinist book ever written. But this doesn't change the fact, that this book is just plain wrong in all respects. Mr. Diamonds marxist/egalitarian political agenda so obvious, its amazing that most cannot see right through his line of reasoning. His major point is to show that Western societies only dominated (the world) because of luck, the right environment and plants and the Nonwestern world is not advanced because of &quot;bad luck&quot; and the so ever &quot;white racism&quot;. He basically playing the same old tirade that Gould, Montagu and other marxists have been spewing for years. His real intent is to basically dismantle white racialism (the main function of the race-denier crowd), and to take advantage of European's peoples universal morality( why don't race-denier theories show up in China, africa, India, Japan or the Non white world?). His hatred for whites is also abhorrent, its obvious he just wants whites to be more &quot;tolerant&quot;, &quot;accepting&quot;, &quot;altrusitic&quot; and open to the Nonwhite world. The the fact that Mr. Diamond is Jewish is no concidence, I urge all readers here to read &quot;The Culture of Critique&quot; chapter 2 where Kevin Macdonald discusses how and why so many of the leading race-deniers/radical environmentalists have been Jews. Starting with Boas in anthropoloy all the way up to Diamond,Gould and Montagu Jewish social scientists have primarily been concerned with trying to squash white ethnocentrism by supporting movements that support racial egalitarianism and enviromentalist theories (of course not all have been Jewish, likewise many Jews have helped sociobiology, this is just a generalization). BUT science is moving on, sociobiology has been vindicated, and the biological basis for human behavior and racial differences is becoming more and more accepted by specialists everyday. Even though the public may be ignorant of the real research for political reasons, that won't change the fact that sociobiology and Jensenism will be vindicated. I suspect that once these theories of human behavior become more and more accpeted by scientists, the popular media/leftists/radical envrionmentalists will lanuch a full scale attack to supress it. You know the sciencitific zietigiest is poor when a book gets the &quot;pultizer prize&quot; for basically spewing &quot;feel good&quot; scientific theories that have absolutely NO basis in fact or research( Mr. Daimond denies sixty years of research into mental and physical differences between the Races, and amazingly makes no attempt WHATSOEVER to refute anyone of them. The current theories are as vindicated, as the theory  that earth goes around the sun) . In the end science, doesn't wait for anybody, for political extremism, bias or dogma when sociobiology and Jensenism get pubilcy vindicated, people and socieites will have to start over and build according to the CORRECT view of human nature. In fifty years, people will be wondering how such garbage, was ever considered serious science at once.
B0001611DI|5.0|I am a big zombie movie fan.  I've seen and own the best.  Night of the living Dead, Day of the Dead, Resident Evil, House of the Dead, and the Return of the Living Dead triogy.  But the one movie I have not yet seen is The Dawn of the Dead.  I have searched contless stores and websites and have not found one.  The one I did find was 129.98!!!  My subsitute teacher once told me about it and now I must own it to finish my set.  I intend to have the orginal DVD set and the re-make DVD set.  As I speak this film is going to be pre-ordered so I will become master of the Living DEAD.
0553274503|5.0|I cant tell you how useful this book is.  It really is awesome.  I probably open it more times than any other book. I have found it to be an invaluable resource.  It is a shame it isn't in print.  I came on to buy 2 more copies for gifts.
6305076626|4.0|This video is far more deserving than any other review the rocky horror picture show could get.  I like to think of this version as perfect for halloween kareoke.  The video has interviews with cos players at the theater about their performance mimicking the movie.  After the movie is over, we are shown just how much fans love the time warp at the theater performance.  Also, the words are silenced at &quot;Oh brad&quot; (as in when they also say janet), &quot;Creature of the night&quot; (all the characters except rocky at the end) Riff Raff's dazzling &quot;it's all over&quot; song thingy, and the music at the beginning of the floor show (as frank is prepping the performers) is lowered significantly.  <br />Each Rocky Horror video has it's own charm, everything in a certain place.  The 25th anniversary, for example, has the two songs that were cut.  As for the dvd's, the basic grey covered one I've noticed is exactly the same as disc one of the two disc set, so as far as dvd's go, the two disc set is the way to go (although the dvd version of the movie sucks because the audio tracks are different, it just doesnt seem right, but the extras are great)  If you're a newcomer to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and you need other people to tell you just how great it is, this video is for you (it does include the movie by the way).
B00005JLT5|5.0|Adrian Brody is in the role of a lifetime. He certainly deserved the Oscar for his acting performance in The Pianist.<br />Very moving and touching. This historical film will go down as one of the greatest films in history.
B000002G0P|5.0|I bought this album when I was 17, when it first came out.  I loved it but didn't really understand it.  I lost it two years or so later and forgot about all the songs except \\"Tragic Comic\\".  Just this past week I picked it up again for the giggles.  I guess a lot of things have happened in the past ten years that have made me appreciate the album for what it is.  This is definitely not your sappy love or sex album, and not your 3 minute pop song album.  It is a REAL album.  Akin to Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness in having a concept, but far beyond in depth.  As a Christian who struggles with my own sins against God and as on interested in Bible Prophecy, I relate to the third side now more than when I first had the album.<br />Side 1 - yours<BR>Very nice, good rock, tight and virtuosic.  All songs very cool.<br />Side 2 - mine<BR>Oh so sweet agony.  Love and desperation at its best.<br />Side 3 - the truth<BR>Absoulutely wonderful, full of wonder, sent chills down my spine.<br />I think the other reviews speak about this album suffieciently enough as far as the details of particular songs, so I won't go into details.  But, if you see this album around somewhere, buy it and apprectiate the brilliance and statement of faith this album makes.  Enjoy!!!
B00008EY7H|5.0|Outstanding music that I can't get out of my head.  The acts are great and the costumes beautiful. Highly recommended!
B000089RVX|3.0|Unlike most people on here i can say i've been an Evanescence fan since the days of Origin.With that said Fallen is a good album. From a musicains standpoint this album is far inferior to origins. This album doesnt offer any diversity besides the piano tracks. It just blands to together. And the fact that most of the remade tracks on here arent as good as the originals (Whisper,Imaginary etc)Production wise this is the best Evanescence album to date. Lryic wise Amy and Ben have really matured more as song writers. Music wise Ben Moody is showing alot of different steps from Origin it's alot harder. (which is a good thing). Overall The stand out tracks on this album are the singles (Bring Me To Life,Going Under &amp; My Immortal) other then that this album is an ok evanescence album i've already worn tired of it. It's not what i really expected from the group but it's also not a dissappointment. (Oh yea i know Ben is gone but im writing as if it were the day i bought it.)
B000060P79|1.0|This band takes a genre that used to be fun and rebellious one step closer to a genre full of boy bands like N'Sync. Their music and lyrics are horrible. They prance around in the videos just trying to attract the young female crowd...attract that crowd, and you are set for a while...at least until the next cute boy group comes along. If many more bands like this come along, this genre will be ruined completely. Just like what Nu Metal has done to actual metal music. Do the rest of us a favor and do not support this band, if you do, it will only fuel more.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert organized by Eric Clapton and George's son, Dhani marked the one year anniversary of George Harrison's death.  Many songs from the Beatles era are here as well as from George's great All Things Must Pass album.  Features an incredible line-up from Paul McCartney, Billy Preston, and Ringo Starr to Jeff Lynne, Eric Clapton, Nora Jones, and Ravi Shankar.<br />  Dhani, who looks just like George, played througout the concert.  The only low point was when Tom Petty came out to do 2 songs: Taxman and I Need You.  The guy simply can't sing.  Anyway Paul came out to do For You Blue and Something on ukelele like he did on his tour, but here the whole band comes in at the end for the original version.  Jeff Lynne sings on I Want to Tell You and Give Me Love, Eric Clapton on Beware of Darkness, Isn't it a Pity and If I Needed Someone, and Paul again for All Things Must Pass.<br />  Indian Raga is used for The Inner Light (lyrics taken from the Tao de Jing) as well as Ravi Shankar's tribute to George, his daughter Nora Jones conducting.<br />  Ringo sings Photograph which George wrote with him as well as Honey Don't written by George's hero Carl Perkins; My Sweet Lord sung by Billy Preston.  Here Comes the Sun is here of course (sung by Joe Brown who preceded the Beatles) and the finale: While my Guitar Gently Weeps.  Short interviews intersperse the concert and it's a great tribute.<br />  Also is Michael Palin and the Monty Python Lumberjack song featuring Tom Hanks.  George's wife, Olivia is also there.  Conducted at the Royal Albert Hall (yes the one from A Day in the Life), and I think the whole thing captures the true spirit of what George was about.
0385510438|3.0|When I decided to read this book about two weeks ago and bought it from my local B&amp;N store - the main reason was the summary I read on the cover recanting what seemed to be an exciting tale of a defendant being spared his life yet seeking revenge on the jury that convicted then sentenced him to life in prison. What I found the real story to be is following a young gumshoe news reporter and his experiences with the people in a small southern town. Yes, it begins with a murder and there is a significant plot surrounding it - but don't be fooled into thinking this is a legal courtroom thriller by any stretch of the imagination. It more so narrates a small towns activities and how a community reacts to rather big events such as the previously mentioned murder trial mixing in their traditions with politics, people and work. And although I thought that the book's ending could have had a surprise or two instead of putt-putting to the end (which is the reason why this book for me gets 3 instead of 4 stars). (The only 5 star book i have read in the last few months was the Di Vinci Code). I would say that this was an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to those of you who would like a good general story about people - not necessarily about a courtroom drama

B00005JM02|4.0|Amazing, this new computer animation.  It used to take years to make animated movies, now it can be in a matter of weeks.  Remember the Lion King's famous Wildebeest stampede scene?  That alone took two years to create.  The movie was in production forever.  Now with companies like Pixar, the animation is actually more realistic, clearer, better, and quicker.<br />Nemo is a small clown fish who is eager to begin school.  His father (Albert Brooks) is reluctant to let him go grow up.  Nemo talks him into letting him go, and he gets in with a group of fish who are daring each other who will go closer to forbidden waters.  When Nemo starts to go out and show the others he is not afraid, his father grabs him, pulls him back, and chews him out.  Nemo gets mad at dad, and swims out toward a rowboat sitting in the water.  On the way back, he is taken by a scuba diver who drives away in the boat.<br />Now dad has to go find him.  The film is about the hunt.  Along the way, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) will help in the search.  Turns out Nemo is in Austrailia, giving a great chance to look at the Great Barrier Reef.  Naturally it looks fantastic.  <br />One other point.  This is a great movie for families.  Not just because there is really no objectionable material (language, violence) but also that when Nemo gets mad at his father, he defies his orders and is immediately penalized.  What a great lesson.  So often, kids in movies disobey and face no penalty.  Here, Nemo's disobedience costs him a great deal.  A great parent/child discussion opportunity in addition to being a quality product.  Highly recommended!
0142437611|5.0|This is Bellow's paean to failure, the slow slide of a good-hearted though dumb and self-destructive man.  He is heading to his doom, and is a sucker the whole way.  Reading this is hard, much like the inexorable decline of people in a Balzac novel, but it is a peculiarly American brand of failure with the post-war culture and Hollywood dreams in tow.  It is a masterpiece.<br />Recommended, but keep the valium handy.

B0001ENY6M|1.0|After hearing only a few tracks, I was astonished that the producers of this CD would so brazenly steal from Peter Gabriel's incomparable score for Martin Scorsese's &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; Mr. Gabriel deserved the Oscar he won for his original, painstakingly researched and masterfully composed piece.  It's a stunning example of what a score should be for a film of this genre. <br />I'm thoroughly disappointed in Mel Gibson for approving the  near-pirating of an original that can't be duplicated - ever. <BR>If this imitation is Gibson's sincerest form of flattery, then the least he could have done was to credit Peter Gabriel somewhere on the CD cover.<br />Even though the score may be brilliant, moving and passionate in its own way, I can't take it any more seriously than I would another Elvis imitation.
B00011D1RC|5.0|If you want to know about Hollywood splendor... this is your movie. The &quot;golden age of the movies&quot; greatest studio was the MGM and Mr. Mayer and company put all the best in this brilliant adaptation of Vicki Baum novel. I love every frame of it. The art deco, the music, the stars... Oh, my God! This is cinema! The cast is superb. The Barrymore brothers, the little Crawford (then), the great Beery. And Lewis Stone, what a kind of gentleman and good actor. And Garbo, of course. When she is sad, you are sad. When she is happy, you are happy. And when she said: &quot;The sun!&quot;.

0783225849|1.0|Alfred Hitchcock's, Psycho definitely earns the title of a classic 1960's film.  In contrast to Hitchcock's other high-budget films where he usually uses his favorite blondes, beautiful rich clothing and expensive sets, Psycho stands out in its starkness.  This is a good thing because it proves that Hitchcock can take a simple film and turn it into something amazing.  Almost like turning an ugly duckling into a swan.  If you have never seen a Hitchcock film you will be pleased with the acting and the plot.  This twisty horror film must have set the tone for other directors in Hollywood at the time, and the many more films to come in the future.  Psycho grabs your attention and will have you biting your fingernails nervously waiting to see what is going to happen next.  <BR>I really enjoyed the phenomenal acting by Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates, and how he made me actually feel sympathy for him.  He does an excellent job convincing the audience to like him, even though we should dislike him because he is a crazy murderer.    The acting by Janet Leigh, who plays Marion Crane, shows her ability to put a lot of emotion into her character.  The famous shower scene and the look of death in her eyes really made her part in the film shine.  As Marion falls down in the shower, it shows her eyes and they appear to be as frozen as ice.  The scene is really creepy and I am now conscious when I take showers in hotels.  <BR>  The plot in this film is very surprising and suspenseful.  Marion steals $40,000 from her employer and leaves town to be with her lover.  She stays in an old motel which is owned by murderer Bates.  When Marion's sister Lila hasn't heard from her in days, she gets worried and works with a detective in hopes of finding her.  Bates is questioned and acts as if he is innocent.  He continues to kill anyone suspicious coming to his motel and later in the film we find that Bates is not so innocent after all.  Bates seems like a pretty likable guy, it ishis mothers' personality that takes over him.  Her crazy personality really overpowers Bates and makes him a murderer.     He wears a wig and pretends to be his mother and his character becomes very suspicious.  I really like how mysterious the plot is because it kept me very interested and entertained at the same time.<BR>Hitchcock's use of camera angles and music really helps the film.  From the famous shower scene with Marion's blood swirling down the drain and the sound of the knife stabbing her, really sends chills down your spine.  The shrieking sound of the knife really make you believe that it is actually happening and the visual of her falling down with the shower curtain make this scene famous.  Another great camera angle in the film is when Bates is watching Marion change through a small, secret peephole in the wall.  You can see every black eyelash on Bates eyes and every blink he makes.   The music also makes this movie because if you pay special attention you will see how well Hitchcock uses the same music throughout the film in different scenes, yet every time it makes the scene even more amazing.  The music is really creepy and every time you hear it, you know something is right about to happen.<BR>I really liked the film, but like every film it can always use improvements.  In some scenes not too much really happened, or there wouldn't be a lot of talking.  Still, Hitchcock managed to make all his scenes unique.  I was disappointed when I found myself laughing when I should have been screaming in horror during some of the murders.  They just looked too fake and cheesy to the point that I couldn't help but laugh, and become disappointed with the scene.  An example was when Bates murdered the detective and he stabbed him while he was walking up a staircase.  The detective takes forever to actually fall over and his facial expressions are awful.  Even though there are small cheesy disappointments the rest of the movie makes up for it.<BR> The ending and the last visual image of Bates sitting in the chair waiting to be questioned, acting like his mother will not leave my mind.  By this point in the movie Bates' mother has taken over him and she is now in control of everything he does.  That last glimpse of him sitting there calmly not scared of anyone in the world, not even a pesky fly resting on his hand.  Perkins does an excellent job playing the role of Bates and really shows great emotion for acting in this dual role.  Hitchcock really shocked his audience with this film and it is now a favorite classic to many people.  If you're looking for a movie with horror, twists and suspense, then this is the perfect film to see.  Next time you chose to stay in a motel, be careful and look for peepholes, you never know what kind of psycho could be watching you!
6304025831|5.0|Casino is a 172 minute 1995 Universal Studios release directed by Martin Scorsese. The cast is possibly the best cast assembled for a gangster movie. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone are the featured stars, and do a brilliant job of portraying the mob lifestyle. The supporting cast features James Woods, Don Rickles, and Alan King, all of which deliver outstanding performances.<br />Casino is based on a true story dating from 1972 to 1983 on the life of Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), a professional gambler who has ties to the mob. He is enlisted to run a casino in Vegas for his gangster friends, who then take a cut of the profits. His friend Nicky (Joe Pesci), is in charge of looking out for Sam, and does the job with zeal. Sam meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), and falls in love. It is a storybook beginning, but then things begin to fall apart.<br />As with most gangster movies, things begin to go sour. Casino is a display of what unlimited money and power can do to those who are not careful. Ginger becomes a drug addict, and strays occasionally to an old flame, Lester Diamond (James Woods) for drug binges, spending tens of thousands of dollars. Nicky becomes to mob boss of Las Vegas, not asking permission from his bosses for what he does. He has the FBI trying to arrest him, and is banned from all the casinos in town. He also becomes involved in drugs and with Ginger, which can get them killed by the mob bosses. Sam is denied a gaming license, and begins to draw too much attention to himself and the mob by going on television to plead his case. He also has the added distraction of trying to deal with Ginger and Nicky, both of whom are causing him problems due to their activities.<br />Eventually all the activities in Vegas get the mob bosses in trouble and they kill almost everyone connected to them and the casino, except for Sam and Ginger who kills herself with an overdose of drugs. Sam goes back to gambling for the bosses and his dream life as a casinoboss is over.<br />I would give this movie five stars. DeNiro, Pesci, and Stone are perfect for their roles, and the acting is flawless. The story line is original and compelling. The viewer gets to know the characters well, and can sympathize with them. I feel this is a movie not to be missed.
B0001611DI|4.0|\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" has had a few previous released on DVD, all of which are now extremely rare, so it comes as a blessing that Anchor Bay has released a new version, just in time to coincide with the remake hitting theatres (with Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, no less). While the movie itself and the extras are fantastic, this may not be the best edition to buy, read on to find out why....<br />The movie itself needs no introduction to any horror fan, as this is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies ever made, and by far the best zombie picture. I will skip right to the qualities of the DVD itself, to save boredom for anyone who already knows the plot (which I imagine is everybody reading this). The most notable feature on the Divimax DVD is the commentary from George Romero and Tom Savini, with Perry Martin doing the moderating. Similar to the commentary on \\"Day of the Dead\\", both Savini and Romero are lively and enthusiastic about this movie, which is surprising considering that the movie is more than 25 years old. The anecdotes and back stories will definitely give fans some insight, as well as plenty of trivia knowledge. This is probably the best Romero commentary so far. The only other extras are an extensive photo gallery (with some great shots), and some promotional material that most people have seen already. If the extras seem sparse, there is a reason for that: rumor has it that Anchor Bay is planning a larger, more extensive Special Edition later in 2004. Like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" DVDs, the first release might be just a taster.<br />Before moving onto the less positive aspects, it should be noted that this is perhaps the video transfer released so far. While previous editions were fragmented, grainy, and muddy looking, this one is clear, having scrubbed 25 years worth of wear and tear on the master. This beats all previous editions, hands down.<br />My gripes with the new \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" DVD are nothing to do with what was included, but what was not included. This version runs 127 minutes, while as any fan knows, the original prints ran 142 minutes. The previous \\"Director's Cut\\" released on DVD was 137 minutes long (the only time I have seen the full 142 released was on an import laserdisc), so why couldn't they have included the longer cut here? For fans waiting for a new release, this is a bit of a letdown. Also noticeable is the lack of any documentaries or other supplements beyond the commentary. This is understandable if this release is only a taster, however, so I will be waiting in hopes that the new edition solves this problem.<br />Overall, horror fans could not ask for a better movie to have on DVD, even if completists like me are unhappy with the shorter cut. The remastering alone makes this worth the price tag alone, while the commentary is a welcome addition to the movie.but what was not included.

B000127LW2|5.0|First off, I must say Voyager's premise was not developed in a chat room.    Next I must say you nuts who are griping about how \\"awful\\" it is.  I must say, in my oppinion it is wonderful.  The packaging is SUPERB!  a nice DVD booklet inside of a weird cool looking orange transparent case with a pretty picture.  Although the episodes are few, they are great and are made up for with special features.  I definately would recommend this product to anyone longing for Voyager, I love it.
1563890119|5.0|&quot;Could Not Dream of Heaven.&quot; The preceding quote is one of the many thoughts that mmake up a brilliant character, The Sandman.<br />This graphic novel is both beauty and wit. Most of the art is breathtaking as well as descriptive.This novel begins with Morpheus,another name for the Sandman or Dream King, trapped. Stripped of his powers and life he spends nearly a cenntury trapped. When he finally does escape, he finds his home in taters and his servants nearly destroyed. He then beggins a journey to collect his tools again. His first tool to recollect is his bag of sand, which he finds with the hellp of John Constanntine, a dectective. Once he has found his precious sand, he travels to hell to reclaim his helmet. There he finds a demon who he must battle by trumping the demon with a larger from the the demon's last. Once he has recovered his helmet the demon is banished from hell and the Sandman continues his journey in seach of his last tool, a red jewel. JUst as he finds the jewel,Dr.Dee,a mad man driven by the power he posses to make dreams real when he has the jewel, takes the stone and Morpheus is left powerless. The rest of the story is good but I refuse to give away the WHOLE thing. The ending comic is the best in which Dream meets up with his siter Death, who tells Morpheus of Mary Poppins and rebukes him for being gloomy. This is a great piece of work which I highly recommend. Though I'm told the rest of the series is much better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|That pretty much says it all.  It is a great fantasy with exciting action, a good story, impressive visuals, solid acting, a well written script and a good ending.<br />It's definitely not historically accurate or overly new and innovative.<br />It may be THE single best video to try out a new surround sound system with - which I did.<br />It certainly takes you back to the days of Hollywood's glory.  Gladiator is a true epic and a great movie.
0679721037|4.0|John Hersey¡¦s ¡§Hiroshima¡¨ is a tale of survival for the book depicts how and what the witnesses and survivors of the atomic bomb overcame. An outsider might consider someone who had escaped the life-threatening situation of the bombing lucky, but each survivor had to endure the aftermath. The effects, ranging from the guilt of living, lost of friends or family members, physical disabilities caused by the bombing, made the lives of survivors extremely difficult. Throughout the narratives of six different characters, they each went through diverse ways of surviving the bomb and many other side effects both physically and emotionally. <br /> The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was an unexpected event for the residents of the city. Surviving the initial blast proved to be only the first step in the emerging nuclear age. When the bomb struck, in knee-jerking reactions each victim reacted differently towards ¡§the tremendous flash of light that cut across the sky.¡¨ (p.5) Other than the nimbleness of the Hiroshima citizens, their escapes from death were a matter of luck. Some of the survivors were shielded by barriers and some by simply turning away. For example, Mr. Tanimoto, the pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, ¡§threw himself between two big rocks in the garden¡¨ (p.5) in order to avoid the flash. As for Mr. Sasaki, a surgeon working at the Red Cross Hospital, ¡§he was one step beyond an open window when the light of the bomb was reflected¡¨ (p.14). He ducked in order to avoid the ¡§gigantic photographic flash.¡¨ (p.14) During this flash of light, thousands of people perished, yet Hersey¡¦s focus follows the trail of those who were spared. <br />After the bombing, the survivors not only have to face injuries and emotional pain, but also faced the challenge of rebuilding their lives. Hiroshima was left without the necessary requirements of life such as water and food. These needs were met by in the short-term by the outside aid agencies,but the long-term challenge of recreating a life was left to the determination of the hibakushas. Life was easier for the survivors twelve years later when the Hibakusha Medical Law was put into effect. The law provided a wider range for assisting the health, medical treatment and the welfare of the survivors. Yet, in each case, the six survivors have somehow constructed a meaningful life.<br /> In the medium and long-term aftermath of the bombing, the struggle for survival continued. Researchers noticed unusual diseases and symptoms appearing in the hibakushas. Survivors were developing ¡§A-bomb cataracts¡¨ p.104, including stunted growth of children and mutated babies with heads smaller than normal. It was found that some of the pregnant women exposed to radiation had given birth to children with severe mental retardation. This condition is known as, microcephaly. These problems exacerbated the suffering of the survivors, especially given the traditional Japanese attitudes toward handicapped children. Other strange symptoms appeared also, some unexpected and some problems kept re-occurring, problems such as leukemia and cancers. A-bomb victims have to live through the fear of undetected diseases emerging without prior warning.  The psychological effects also influenced the hibakushas, the deaths of family members or friends and the aftereffect of exposure to radiation can heighten survivor¡¦s anxiety and fears. <br /> Aside from the physical wounds, emotional wounds were even harder to mend. The hard-gained properties of the survivors might be destroyed, leaving the hibakushas penniless and homeless. Not just the lost of material goods but the lives of family members might also be gone or endangered by severe injuries. More distressing, people also suffer from ¡§survivor guilt¡¨. For example, men lived while women died, parents outlived their children, and wives or husbands widowed. Even worse, some hibakushas might suffer because they ran away, ignoringpeople¡¦s ¡§Give me water¡¨ (p.31) and ¡§Help me.¡¨ (p.18) For instance, in the book, Mr. Tanimoto ¡§realized he was taking to much time¡¨ (p.31) to ¡§carry water to the suffering strangers¡¨ (p.31), he decided to ¡§run away¡¨ (p.31) from those who were ¡§crying their thirst.¡¨ (p.31)<br /> The memories still linger and haunt the survivors¡¦ lives. Like in the story, Dr. Sasaki was bothered by not having to identify the corpses dragged out to the mass cremations, where ¡§with the nameless souls might still, all these years later, be hovering there, unattended and dissatisfied.¡¨ (p.109)
B00009TB5G|5.0|So, after seeing Fellowship I was somewhat afraid that TTT would not live up to the greatness of that movie.  I was most pleased to discover that it was an incredible film in its own right, well, sort of...<br />The key is that TTT the movie, like TTT the book is really not supposed to stand alone.  Lord of the Rings is NOT a trilogy.  Well, at least it wasn't supposed to be.  It is a single novel that was broken up for publishing reasons.<br />That said, it's an extremely well done PART of a movie...  Again, there are a few parts I could do without - the comic relief of Gimli, Aragorn's near death experience...  But I overlook those as minor annoyances.<br />Again, it is a true treat for fans of Tolkien and is enjoyable for those who are open to truly great fantasy and enjoy a good epic.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This movie is great for both kids and adults. I hadn't seen it in about ten years, and watching it again really brought back memories... even if you're an adult, you can still laugh with the characters, and the beauty of the scenes is exceptional... the songs are memorable as well. This is definitely one of Disney's best productions.<br />By the way, when you watch it... there are two interesting things that my friends and I noticed.. first, in the first half, in one of the scenes on the boat, one of the sailor's shirts change colors while Prince Eric is talking. Second, when the Ariel is in his castle, they put her to bed and she doesn't have any sheets or blankets... notice what happens just a few seconds later...
B00000JLWW|1.0|Okay, it wasn't that bad.  I would have given it maybe 3 stars based on it being a sappy story with impressive effects and excellent costumes and set design.<br />HOWEVER - this movie has the most atrocious, mindless, badly written dialogue of all time.  It was NOT in any way true to the period which was not only incredibly distracting but it would have been SO easy to fix.  It was badly paced, badly acted and grated on my nerves to the point where at the end, when Leonardo does the cannonball to the bottom of the Atlantic, I had to laugh out loud!  Just so I wouldn't have to hear him talk again!<br />If you enjoy period pieces with elegant, refined or even remotely historically accurate language, this is not the movie for you.
0375432302|5.0|Great book! Make sure you also read Angels and Demons.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I think the old sports adage is \\"somewhere in-between\\".  Thats the category \\"Matrix - Revolutions\\" falls into.  Is it a 5 star movie? No. (But the first was.)  Is it a 1 star movie? No.  It's somewhere in-between.<br />I think I can say I was honestly disappointed in this movie, based on its predecesors success.  Too much CGI, too much philosophy, too much.  Less is more; the Wachowski brothers and George Lucas would do well to realize that great technology does not equate to great film making.<br />In any case, I'm waiting to purchase the Matrix Trilogy in a pre-packaged collector's edition.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Ok I thought I would really like this. I like \\"Me Against The Music\\" but the rest of the cd is really bad.  She doesnt sing, well she does sing, but really horrably. She sounds like she has a really bad cold.  In certain songs her background singers are doing most of the work.  You would think with all the money she has she would take some singing lessons. Not only is her so called \\"singing\\" bad, but her lyrics are weak.  I think a 8th grader could write this stuff.  Not only that, but her lyrics make her sound a little concieted.  \\"Am I too hot for you?\\" \\"Outrageous, my shopping spree\\" I dont get it. I would give this cd a 0.5 if I could.<br />Me Against the Music- Good song, good beats, not so great with the lyrics. 3/5<br />(I got that) Boom Boom- This is an ok song, beats are ok but the Ying Yang Twins arent so good. 2/5<br />Showdown- I do kinda like this one. The only thing that is bothersome is when it goes \\"eeeeeh oooooh ooooh\\" sounds kinda like a cat. 2/5<br />Breathe On Me- Good song I think this one is the best one, but really poor lyrics. 4/5<br />Early Mornin'- Good song I love the beats. Moby produced this, its hot. Again, lyrics do suck. 3/5<br />Toxic- Stupid song, you cant understand anything she says.  1/5<br />Outrageous- Another stupid song, really stupid lyrics.  0/5<br />Touch of My Hand- Good song about masterbation.  Something you would expect of Britney. 2/5<br />The Hook up- Funky song, kinda Jamaican-ish. 2/5<br />Shadow- Oh no! Horrable slow song. 0/5<br />Brave New Girl- I think this one is by far the worst track.  The beats suck along with the lyrics. It kinda reminds me of something a little 8 year old girl would sing at a talent show. 1/5<br />Everytime- Another really bad slow song.  Britney really shouldnt sing slow songs.  0/5
0316666343|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" takes some getting used to. I won't spoil the plot, but it's enough to say that it is told from a very unique point of view. I, personally, found it excellent once I got over my initial reservations. The mixture of sadness and hope is interesting, somewhat reminiscent of \\"My Fractured Life.\\" The point of view is entirely unique and quite a contrast to the sugar coated \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" All in all, excellent and highly recommended.
B000127LW2|1.0|I have not bought this product nor do I plan to. Now here are my reasons. I refuse to pay for 15 episodes, poor special features and poor packaging what I paid for full seasons with great special features. Not to mention the whole wrong and multiple disk problem.

B00005JLR6|5.0|&quot;In America,&quot; directed by Jim Sheridan, tells the story of a modern-day Irish family that moves to New York City, where the father hopes to pursue his acting career.  Their lives become connected to that of Mateo (played by Djimon Hounsou), a troubled artist who lives in their apartment building.<br />This is a beautiful film, superbly acted by a fine cast.  In addition to Hounsou, the principal players are Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton as the Irish parents, and Sarah Bolger and Emma Bolger as daughters Christy and Ariel.  The cast members have a powerful chemistry which really gives impact to the characters' interconnected relationships.<br />&quot;In America&quot; is a story that's told with a gritty, sweaty urban realism, yet many scenes have a magical, almost fairy-tale like quality.  Sheridan weaves allusions to the film &quot;E.T.&quot; into this film as an effective motif that complements the characters and their emotional journeys.  Also effective is the film's use of classic songs to heighten the emotion of the story.<br />&quot;In America&quot; is an intriguing portrait of multiethnic urban life, and also offers a compelling look at life in a family that is struggling financially.  Although there are moments of pain, there are also nice humorous touches and the film overall has a genuine sweetness that never seems fake.  This story deals with enduring themes: family ties, friendship, and surviving tragedy.  But most of all it's about hope and embracing life.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|Why would someone who listens to Korn and Mary Manson write a review, let alone, waste his time on talent such as this or any other great death metal band. Keep to your three-chord-wanna-be metal.<br />Anyway, this is actually a surprise. Is it me, or do Cannibal seem to improve their musicianship on each album? I think so. It's also kind of interesting to see that they've slowed down the tempo a little bit on a few songs, which in turn, makes them heavy as a really heavy thing (lol). My only problem (again) is that the album lacks a bottom edge, mainly bass. So I hear that Neil Kernon has given us an album of potatoes (instead of meat and potatoes, the meat being the bass). Don't get me wrong, this album slays, but it's all trebble. They have improved their technicality and taken brutality to a new level. This album gets a thumbs up from me. Keep up the good work boys. L8r.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This is a comedy alright, but the jokes on us.  I enjoyed the journey of these two lost souls finding company and comfort with each other as &quot;strangers in a strange land&quot;.  I would have been OK with the ending being Bill Murray's character just riding to the airport thinking about what just happened.  But this whispering in the ear and excluding the audience after letting us in on every little detail up to that point--- well it just ticked me off.  Oh, I can sit there and come up with my own ending, but I wanted to know how, in Sophia's vision, this story ends.   Maybe she doesn't know herself!  I felt like I had just been had and I don't care for that.  Had I known the ending before the seeing the movie, I'd have passed on the journey. <br />I did get a few chuckles out of it and loved the &quot;Lip my stockings&quot; scene.  But found the premise as rude as listening to a friend tell a joke to a group of people, only to have him turn and walk away before the punchline.  You just wonder, why they bothered.
0812550706|2.0|After reading the reviews here on amazon I expected to read one of the best sci-fi books of all time.  I was truly dissapointed.  In short i'd say that it was very hard for me to identify with the main character.  He's so young and alone and different from everyone else.  If that doesn't describe YOU then you will probably not think this book is so great.  Maybe it's because i'm now in my 20's.  I have read many great books in my life and this wasn't one of them.  If you are a young reader and feel like an outsider then you will probably LOVE this book.

B000002GDJ|5.0|This was the very first band I had seen in concert as a teenager. And this was the very first album I had gotten by these three Dudes. Call me a throwback, I don't care... but music back in 1978 through 1980 was so cool. It was a great time to be a teenager. Disco was on the radio, but Punk and New Wave were on the verge of taking over. Combat Boots and Leather Jackets were becoming the rage... and the music was to follow.<BR>This album is one of their finest. However, there is also their 4-CD compilation titled &quot;Message in a Box&quot;... and if you want it all, get that one. Trust me ... =o)
0385504209|2.0|I was forced to read this book in my book club. Very disappointing! Interesting theories, but the storyline was too predictable to keep me interested. As I read, I could already visualize the movie...reminded me of John Gresham's good idea/bad-writing-turned-screenplay style. And while the author claims much of this book is based on fact, much of it is really only based on theories. As the book is catagorized as fiction, I have no problem with a book based on theory. However, it has to be supported by a well-told story to keep me interested. Couldn't even make it to the end!
B000063UR2|1.0|I'm a fantasy addict.  I heard about this movie and thought, &quot;Oh!  It sounds great!&quot;  Then I watched it.  And thanked whatever powers that be that I had rented it, not bought it.  Poorly done in just about ever aspect--you can see the fake horns bouncing on the &quot;unicorns'&quot; foreheads--it dragged on forever.  I finished it with the thought that surely--SURELY--it would get better.  It didn't.  It gets one star for Tim Curry, who is memorable if nothing else, but otherwise it was a waste of time.
0060931736|3.0|After reading the novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie I felt that at times it was somewhat interesting but mostly uneventful. Just as the book would take a turn that would get my attention it seemed like Spark found a way to bore me,which made this a very hard novel to finish. <BR> The main idea of the book was well established and easy to understand. Miss Jean Brodie a teacher at an private school, was simply trying to \\"relive\\" her prime again through several eleven year old girls. She picked six girls and tried to mold them into \\"perfect\\" young women or as she called them \\"the creme de la creme.\\" She taught these six girls how women were to speak, walk, talk and act. Although later in life the girls realized that Miss Brodie had taught them a life of make-believe and that in the real world that was not how people acted at all. <BR> At the beginning this book seemed very interesting but that quickly changed and there was no reason to read on. I feel that Spark did a horrible job explaining important details in the novel that would paint a picture and make the reader feel apart of the book. Also Spark had a way with being able to go on and on about pointless details which in my eyes did not make the book more exiting it just made each page drag. Also Spark kept jumping from one year to another then back to the previous year which did not do anything except frustrate me. Also the characters are unreal and misunderstood throughout the novel. Miss Jean Brodie was sought to be an idol at the beginning of the book but as the novel went on she was actually trying to fix all her mistakes and imperfections through her students. And as far as the other girls, they were not fully explained and the little information that was presented was repeated over and over again.<BR> Overall I think that the novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is not one I would recommend. It is not a horrible novel but the way everything was explained did not satisfy me and was boring. At times I did think the novel was going to pick up and change directions but Spark gave away the ending less than half way through the book which made it pointless to read on.

B00008CLOA|5.0|this is good, very good stuff. Probably my favorite cd, which is amazing because i thought i would like it, but not be crazy about it. I thought( and still kinda do) that pink floyd was the band you acknowledged if your were some idiot who wanted to sound smart, but this is gooooooood. The way it flows, the climaxes, the mood, it is very good. I interpreted the first side as dealing with mortality, and the second part( starting with &quot;money&quot;) concerning itself with intensifying degrees of insanity.(ending with pink floyd's most personal experience about insanity, &quot;brain damage&quot;,you know who its about). The opening is one of the best openings ever in a cd. the talking, sound effects, and the screaming which leads into &quot;breathe&quot;. And the sound effects and electronics have aged very well. They sound amazing to a virgin earlike mine, and much more evocative than most other electronic enhanced or based music. But back to the mortality side, the climax and end of that is &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; (my favorite) an instrumental about death/heaven/afterlife/whatever with good singing. most people say its too long, but i think its geart, its all great
6301954947|2.0|I'd like to supplement the other reviews. Waterloo did indeed screen in a 3-plus hour version which I attended in college circa 1972. In that edition, I would rate it 5 stars, for it did have the historical accuracy and timeline of 'The Longest Day' and the sweep and drama of such great period films as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Gone With The Wind'. But without all the personal subplots, the action was more intense and that helped this viewer stay focused. I was pretty-much blown away, so I did some homework. <br />This film is extraordinary for both it's scope and the high level of authentic detail. The uniforms, weapons and accoutrements are very accurate, and the battlefield tactics reflect great study on the part of the set decorators and stunt coordinators. From the individual line soldier with his flint musket to the massed artillery barrages and calvary charges, the period 'manuals of arms' were followed [rules for troop deployment; use and operation of weapons] in more detail for this era that has been committed to film before. <br />In contrast, each combat scene was reconstructed not from the combatant's surviving journals, but from art works made AFTER the battle and when the action periodically 'freezes' on-screen for a few seconds, each freeze is in fact a tableaux of a famous painting, many of which are on view at the Lourve or the Hermitage. <br />Someone said read your history for a fuller understanding? Okay, but try looking up the paintings and then re-view the film with those images in mind. Many master's art works are capured in hue and composition when the action freezes as perfectly as the arms and tactics. The effect is to make it seem as if the art was purloined from filmed news coverage somehow. I was blown away all over again! <br />Every film is a Hollywood magic show [or the eastern equivalent in this case]. But the inclusion of so much historical fine art is one of the best smoke and mirrors tricks ever put to film; shrewd, subtle, and a reminder that art imitates art itself as much is it imitates life.<br />The VHS version wouldn't fit on one tape if it contained the whole film. It was butchered by editors unfamiliar with the historical timeline, the weapons and tactics, or the art! I can hardly give it two stars in this edition.<br />So give us a region-1 DVD and please! Make it the director's movie, not some truncated and confused mass of sound and fury.
B000002G7E|3.0|i have mixed feelings about this one. I pretty much like all of it, except john cale's songs. im sorry, i may hate it because of its gruesomness, and they may be great songs, but i really dont like them. The gift is kindof funny, and pretty disturbing too, but i cant take Lady Godiva's Operation. It evokes bad stuff, and i really hate hospitals, especially operations. And john cale's voice is way too unnerving, so maybe it was a success. But i really dig lou reed's songs, especially the title track. whatever, im going in circles.
078322804X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it a week ago and totally fell in love with it. I'm hoping Amazon gets a new shipment soon because I want to buy it SOOO bad.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|As one might reasonably surmise, due to the excessively positive reception of this film (in terms of aesthetic cinematography and acumen of craft) I was somewhat piqued to see it for myself.  After all the extortionate lengths that some critics have endeavored to pursue in adulation of this movie (in particular Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's script and direction), try and imagine the diminutive fraction of possibility that this film might actually have a reputation that precedes it.  Come on, Ebert readily assessed it as a work of sheer brilliance, Siskel's foreskin foreheaded doppleganger Roepert opined likewise, and every other person who ever witnessed it regaled its power to be tantamount to the second coming.  In what absurd, deranged, and forlorn alternate dimension could the facts possibly divagate from the hype?  Well keep your cosmonaut shoes on, because you need jaunt no further than your local multiplex or video store to see how incredibly fallible the majority of critics truly are.  Now, what is wrong with the picture?<BR> One of the unfortunate misgivings about this movie is the fact that the trailer and all its satellite previews made it appear like some kind of standard Murray comedy.  We are given brief glimpses into the more garrulous scenes in the picture, all of which if properly taken out of context and arbitrarily collocated into a filmic presentation would approximately last no more than 45 seconds (hmm, the usual running time for tv spots that advertise these films).  But I can willingly forgive a fallacious trailer as long as I am supplied with some modicum of entertainment.  Not since Gigli have I suffered the kind of cine-masochistic audacity that is prevalent in Lost in Translation.  I can at least commend Gigli on the fact that it made ample use of its running time by appropriating a little something called dialogue (albeit a banal, deliriously unfunny discourse), whereas Lost in Translation decides to express itself in theform of epigrams.  We are given a random collection of words that are so disassociated with human emotions - lines that are empty, callous, frigid, and insipid - that I have heard more convincing dramatic delivery from C-3P0 and his four inch tall life partner R-2D2.  Simply put, no one in this movie knows what sentimentality is, nor would they recognize it if it lodged itself in their urine canal.  But hold your trendy tongues you art house phonies, to any of you who would so naively conclude that I am not familiar with pictures that fail to utilize the standard pentameter of Hollywood banter, for that is far from the case.  2001: Space Odyssey and Eraserhead are both films that confidently employ succinctness in lieu of loquacious rambling.  Yet those two films differ from Coppola's film in the one major way : they actually supplant their silence with a redeemable artistic aspect.  But the script (or lack thereof) is only one of the baneful obstacles this turgid priapus cannot competently penetrate.  <BR> Let me address the area of performance from our two main actors, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson.  Scarlet's character is supposed to be a jaded philosophy major.  The staggering problem of this is the fact that she barely attempts to open her mouth and say something intelligent.  I do not particularly care if Sofia Coppola was trying induce a full-blown aneurysm from those people who watch her movie and recognize the aberrant timidity of her lead heroine, nor do I care if she was trying to suggest the vernal obfuscation of the character who merely studied philosophy on a whim but now finds herself abruptly distanced from the world - such trite characterization that clumsily fuddles with assumptive subtext wretchedly turns a viscid knife in my stomach - because quite honestly, her character made me feel absolutely nothing.  I no doubt theorize that I would receive warmer reciprocity from the rubber inguinal notches of a blow-up doll.  But what is most offensive to me as a moviegoer is the superfluous praise of Murray's \\"outstanding\\" performance.   If someone would kindly delineate to me the fundamental differences of Murray's character here and his portrayal in other movies, I would most humbly appreciate it.  The fact is this:  Bill Murray plays Bill Murray playing Bill Murray in this movie.  He assumes the role he has assumed in every single movie he's ever been in (save for Caddyshack).  The dry wit, the partial smile, the frequently bumptious lifts of the eyebrows to punctuate the irony of a situation - check, check, check, everything seems to be in order.  And though I do appreciate Murray as a comedian, I do not think it befitting to flank him with vociferous hosannas and felicitations simply because his character appeared flaccid for an entire hour and forty two minutes on screen. <BR> So we now set our sights on Coppola as a director.  Given the size of her father (in terms of work and mountainous girth) it is indeed foreseeable that she will be subjected to nepotistic juxtaposition.  But as most of you recall, it was the young voluptuary herself who single-handedly turned the Godfather III from lesser-sequel to garish and straight-to-video histrionic horse manure.  Not apparently content with assassinating the repute of her father's career (after the bloated anti-climax of the last in the Godfather trilogy, he went on to direct the nauseously stifling Jack, a schlocky Robin Williams picture of Spielbergian pseudo-emotional magnitude), the young auteur has decided to proliferate her vile bacteria into the careers of other people.  It's a shame, because if Lost in Translation had been a different film entirely, like Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, it might have been good.  But as it is, it is pure garbage.  Try Monster or American Splendor, two wonderful films forgotten by the burgeoning circle jerk of American critics.  As for Lost in Translation, it definitely attests to the presumption I had that Roger Ebert isan imbecilic merger of words who's increasingly offal taste in movies (something that has never ceased to baffle me) is at the prompt vanguard of the declining state of film recognition.  Here is a man who can volubly opine for two hours on the eminent importance of Orson Wells' great progeny Citizen Kane and the surreal mastery of Fellini's 8 1/2, yet is so obdurately stubborn that he rejects the greatness of movies like Blue Velvet and favors this disposable garbage.  It may seem incredible, but remember that this agglutination of lard bestowed his prestigious and ever-cantankerous thumb of approval to such tripe as the Hulk and Blue Crush.  Bahh. <BR>     There are moments here, though they may be evanescent, that begin to show signs of life - we are traduced into believing a character could delve beyond their static veneer and actually articulate a genuine emotion or two.  There was one scene in the movie when I was so stupid as to presume the torture would lessen and the movie would at least end with an inspired spark, no matter how uneven the events leading up to the denouement.  That scene was the karaoke scene, where Johannson's character bellows an uncertain and stodgy rendition of the Pretenders' \\"Brass in Pocket.\\"  Subsequent to her performance, Bill Murray belts out an Elvis Costello tune.  But even as that aroused some interest it made me much more critical of the film's astronomical failure.  As he sang \\"What's so funny about peace, love, and understanding\\" I began to feel even more molested by my viewing experience.  I have realized why.  It seems that brief sequence is comparable to the film in its entirety.  It flirts with presence of life, it appears to be vibrant and amassed in the blinding neon lights of Japan, yet it reveals the story and the characters as lifeless, mirthless, miserable creatures who faintly utter disjointed nonsense without the slightest palpebration of energy.  The whole movie was so dreadfully absurd in its tragi-comic awfulness that it really made you think of the crooning losers who act like unproclaimed kings in karaoke bars.  Lost in Translation is like that.  Its amateurish, but not in the warm way of most independent movies.  It is stunningly pointless, an exercise in futile relations and even more of wayward characters who have not the capability to recognize their pitiable selves.  It's not that the characters allow their emotions to distract from their enactment with one another, no, it is something far more drab and lugubrious.  It is a representation of two faceless characters.  Two desparate people who cannot recognize the futility nor the audacity of their desparation.  I am reminded of the final scene when Murray says goodbye to Scarlet's character.  That one scene (coupled with the karaoke singing) provides explanation for the entire summarization of the movie.  It is endless and inauthentic, a documentation of absolutely nothing!  Yet it continues to prow along, moving forward despite the lack of enthusiasm or concern, not because Sofia is trying to convey some vague statement about the inefficacy of human relationships, nor because there was a point at all, merely because it is like its characters, it does not possess the proficiency to do anything else. <BR>Why do I anoint it with 5 stars then, if I so evidently despise it?  Because I get a sense of slight satisfaction with the thinking that maybe some lowly desk clerk at Tip Top Video will be perusing through the higher reviews for snobby affirmation of his devotion to this film, some dull expatiation about the esoteric quality of the movie and how others are fools not to appreciate it, only to unearth an inveighed condemnation of unquestionable disgust for a movie that barely qualifies as cannon fodder.

B00009TB5G|5.0|It was Aswome! breath taking,keeps you on the edge of your seat, and they won 11 oscars!
B000089RVX|1.0|It took Evanescence a half a decade to come up with the songs on this CD (for those of us who remember the garbage they cut to CD when they released Origin in 2000 and the two EPs prior to that.)  They managed to cull out just short of a dozen songs for Fallen, and they result is still pathetic.  The next CD, which they will surely be under pressure to write, will suck far more than this one.  To make matters worse, they won the Grammy for Best New Artist - sure to send them to the cut out bin on future CDs, just like every other artist to win that award.<br />Fallen has to be the most repetitive CD I've ever heard.  The first two songs are a sign of the remaining nine.  Same goes for the lyrics.  Over and over with the same trite, high-schoolish, I'm-in-so-much-pain whining.  Amy--cut your wrists already and save all the misery.
B000002H33|5.0|Yes people here it is,believe the hype when it comes to this masterpiece of heavy metal.Master Of Puppets was the first Metallica album i ever bought and well...it's not the heaviest record ever nor is it the fastest but the sheer talent displayed by the entire band is something that totally blows me away !<br />1. Battery : Acoustic starting is really similar to Fight Fire With Fire off Ride The Lightuning.But just as Fight Fire...this also explodes into maximum metal ! A+<br />2. Master Of Puppets : This is just plain awesome...easily the best track on the CD. Great chorus,awesome solo and melody as well as a powerful anti-drug message. A++<br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be : Although not as fast as Battery or the title track this one totally KILLS it is the HEAVIEST song on the album (IMHO) great riff during the chorus<BR> A+<br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) : Another solid track by the band.Starts off with a deep melody then goes into brutality A+<br />5. Disposable Heroes : Eh...i have no idea why but this one always seemed like a bogus track to me however it sports a killer chorus. A-<br />6. Leper Messiah : Very underrated metal monster here people, a great headbanger with a theme very much like Ozzy Osbourne's Miracle Man. A+<br />7. Orion : Ah yes...Metallica at theur highest point.Every member of the band shines on this moving instrumental especially the late legendary bassist Cliff Burton A+<br />8.Damage Inc. i usually skip over this one as it is a weak way to finish this album off...Metallica should have left it at Orion.

B000002ZR7|5.0|The recorded sound is excellent, so is the sound she coaxed from the piano and her interpretation: it is so full of life, singing beautifully all the way with lively rhythms, from both hands and all the voices.  <br /> <br />She is convincing and obviously slower in her tempo she had however digested Gould's interpretation. A very good reference especially to advanced piano students of this lovely piece. And for comparison, reader could check out Gould's two versions and I would also recommend the audience to check out Kempff as well.
0345452577|4.0|Although it took a couple of chapters to get beyond Dr. Delaware and the rest of my &quot;friends&quot;, the book had the same sub-plots and twists that will be familiar to all Kellerman readers and then ends with what could/should be the start of a fantastic new series of novels.  I'm sure I'll miss Alex and Milo, but the CCC sets the stage for more complicated and interesting stories!<br />Kellerman is one of the best insightful mystery author's around today!
B00005BL2A|3.0|I can't believe that Mark Bell (as a producer) allowed these songs to be released so unfinished! Exciter now shows the laziness that Martin has when it comes to taking the song writing process into the production aspect of music. It used to be that Alan Wilder would take care of that and now noone is there to make Martin's beautiful songwriting come alive. <BR>    I would have to say that Tim Simenon did a fine job on Ultra in Alan's place but Mark Bell just let the name DM carry the album instead of trying to get more out of Martin and Dave. This album has none of the DM emotion we're used to hearing with Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion. It seems to me that Martin wrote these songs even though he didn't feel like writing. It seems forced. <BR>     When this album was about to come out, Andrew Fletcher told us that Exciter was going the be the best DM album since Black Celebration. What a lie!!!  <BR>     If you want to get into Depeche Mode, do not start with this album, it will only discourage you. Go for Black Celebration or Violator first. I'm giving 3 stars just because of the great song Comatose (which the album should of been called) because this record is predictable, self-aware and worst of all, sinfully boring!!!!
B000001EGA|3.0|While I loved 3 of the songs, the title track, Someone Saved my Life Tonight, of course, and Tower of Babel, I couldn't get through the rest. I gave a star for each of the 3 good ones. Buy Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, Goodbye Yellow brick Road, or even Songs From The<BR>West Coast instead.
B000002KDO|5.0|This album is so cool!! Where else could you listen to someone actually sing to a marijuana leaf?  Sab again displays their diversity, going from Christian music in After forever to soft flutes in Solitude and finally breaking into the hardcore apocylyptic Into the Void that is consistent with the gothic Sab profile. A bit of Sab trivia for all the reviewers commenting on Ozzy's voice in Solitude.? It's Bill Ward, not Ozzy. Planet Caravan and Swinging the Chain are also done by Ward.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I only gave this a 4 because i've only been able to listen to the CD once so far. Kanye is some deep talent comin from the ROC. He brings a whole new look to a very weak rap game. Some of these other rappers need to be watchin out. About the Album though, Kanye's got some real stuff to say and he says it beautifully and with lyrics that make you think! Big ups to Kanye and all the ROC Familia. REPPIN ///\\\ ROC-A-FELLA
B00000DG1R|5.0|Question:  Which music artist did the best job of combining rock, disco, and new wave into one distinctive sound with memorable lyrics and videos?<br />Answer:  Duran Duran<br />All of Duran Duran's Top 40 hits are included plus the new song.  This collection is much better than &quot;Decade&quot; since there are more songs and includes the 1993 hit &quot;Come Undone&quot;.  The packaging could of been better: no notes, no decent pictures, just song credits.  However, it is unlikely that there will be a better collection than this on one CD.  Highly recommended.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|If you like the emotive power of the film, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, this CD will not disappoint. All of the songs (associated with each scene from the movie) remind you of that particular scene SO STRONGLY THAT IT MOVES ONE TO TEARS. This is the second best Christ movie, in my opinion--JESUS OF NAZARETH ( a very lengthy film that captures Jesus' life from childhood to cruxifiction), being the very best. AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT AS THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 30 SCREENPLAYS WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT.<br />However, the soundtrack to THE PASSION is much better. No comparison really. In this way, I actually like THE PASSION (hats off to Gibson) better than the more orthodox Christian/Biblical JESUS OF NAZARETH. LIKE THE REAL GOD-MAN HE WAS, This Jesus seems more long-suffering, doubting his own divinity, revealing fear to this \\"friends.\\" All of these human feelings are apparent in the accompanying soundtrack. <br />Definitely worth the listening--probably over and over and over again!
0345451325|5.0|Halo the Fall of Reach was one of the best books I have ever read. It is very well written, and has a great storyline that connects perfectly with the game. If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on life. And when your done with this book, get Halo: First Strike, also by Eric Nylund, who is a great author.
B000060MMI|5.0|Wow. I know people have said this about a billion times, but this album makes me wish I was Irish. Just the whole feeling you get listening to it...whoa. I'm normally into metal and I only like a handful of punk bands but Flogging Molly may very well get me more into the punk movement with this album. The opening song &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; starts the album off with a bang that continues through &quot;Kilburn High Road&quot; and others, and lasts until the very end. I do not believe there is a single bad song on this album. I think I want to go pack my bags and move to Dublin...cheers!!!
0553208845|4.0|Sometimes this material is assigned in high school classes as a &quot;novel about Buddhism,&quot; which it is not.  But it is other things.<br />A story like this doesn't function like a novel, or a film.  Some might feel that the book is &quot;slow,&quot; or that they didn't get enough character development, enough action, and so forth.  These concepts are the unfortunate result of a century or two of a mass entertainment mindset.  It's not a movie, it's a parable.  Let's not ask Hesse to compete with John Grisham and Steven Spielberg.  And personally, I could use more &quot;slow&quot; in my life, you probably could too.<br />I would suggest reading this story like you would the story of David in the Bible, or the epic of Gilgamesh, or Voltaire's Candide - it's an investigation into our role as humans in the Big Picture.  The reason that people return to this book and re-read it twenty years later is that the story of Siddhartha reflects the course of a person's life during all the stages of adulthood.  It's a testament to Herman Hesse's considerable abilities that a high school student will be able to appreciate and identifiy with Siddhartha through young eyes, and an older person will engage the book in entirely another way, in accordance with his age.<br />As far as Buddhism goes, the book is sort of tangential in two ways.  First, you're seeing Eastern thought through the eyes of an early 20th century Modernist.  Second, the title character himself politely refuses the Buddha in favor of following his own path, not a system received from another, outside source.<br />I have found myself returning to this story every seven years or so, with each new stage of my life, seeking to unlock some of the grace and beauty that is encapsulated within.  I recommend it only to people who are willing to read slowly and deliberately, with an open mind.
0671027387|3.0|I want to start by saying I really enjoyed this book.  However, as in his other books, some of the technologies he claims are true simply don't exist.  In the case of deception point, most of the advanced technologies he refers to only exist as powerpoint presentations being used by some overly ambitious engineers to justify increases to their program budgets. The technologies simply aren't as advanced as Mr. Brown would have you believe.  If you can get past that, it's a great read, with lots of excitement.
B00018D44U|1.0|i think it is ironic that there are so so many great women artists out there yet for inexplicable reasons sometimes one gets alot of attention. and it has little to do with talent. this artist is one big yawn, and will be gone soon while the industry will continue to look for the next best/newest &quot;thing.&quot; if you look hard you can find alot of great women artists new and veteran who have real inspirational talent. i like etta james for a start.
B000000OQF|5.0|Many bands have talent. But few have timing. This album had both to spare.  &quot;Appetite&quot; was the apotheosis of 1980s metal: hair sprayed-glitz, wired, and throwing fists. Before the kids in Seattle slouched towards wherever, the LA boys focused their aggressiveness into a straight ahead, rollicking romp through the essentials of rock: pentatonic solos, straightup 4/4 time, and three-verse tunes. The album grabs you from the first shot and doesn't let go until it's through with you. <br />But after the bang, then what?  Sadly, GnR said everything they needed to say in this one album.  Apart from the odd gem afterwards, they never moved beyond shopworn peaens to the high-life, unfulfilled auteurism, and faded rehearsals of their earlier glory. They still could put on a good show, though.<br />No doubt about it, &quot;Appetite&quot; sizzles. And unlike many bands that were cut from the Aerosmith cloth--Cinderella, White Lion, Whitesnake--GnR offered an album that crackles with a sensitive and spellbinding intensity. It was truly a quintessential album that capped-off an era. Over 15 years later, it holds up very well.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Narcissistic, racist and empty. Japanese people, for the crime of not being American, are sneered at by Murray and Johnanssen for an hour and a half. All those friends of yours who hated it? They were right.
B000006NPY|5.0|Billy Corgan... What to say, you are a man of great writing talent. This has got to be the most poetic album you have done. For Martha has the best piano solo ever, right up the with Moonlight. This cd got me though some rough times, but thats not why love it. I love it because it is a close symbol of human feelings. A must buy, if you enjoy the pumpkins, classial music, and the feeling of loss.

B00004TWZF|3.0|I first watched this movie on VHS video, and loved the movie soundtrack and recurring theme-- I *hate* the music soundtrack on the DVD, which for reasons I can not figure out is completely different from the videotape, the DVD music sounds like elevator music. Yuck! So if you own this movie on VHS videotape, do not dump it when you get or order the DVD version.  Aside from the music, the DVD of course is nice because it is digital and is is letterbox format.
0385504209|3.0|This book was recommended to me by my roommate. It started out as all she promised it would be, thrilling, engrossing and griping. But somewhere along the line it starts losing you. The author makes feeble attempts to draw you in again, by throwing in alarming facts and figures, not so cryptic puzzles and controversial details but it just makes each chapter shorter and more confusing. Brown does not let you savour the thrill of each chase, he cuts them short and leaves you hanging and perplexed.<br />I think that Da Vinci Code has made people think, in more ways than one. People are going back and reading the scriptures, talking to priests and using a million image searches to find pictures of the last supper. The book is a work of fiction but has gone to prove how gullible people are, reading the book and re-evaluating their faith. It makes one wonder how masses can be stirred to one direction after reading the book and the very same people, after watching Gibson's movie show so much devotion to the faith they questioned before.<br />The Da Vinci Code is loosely based on events from the Bible and that is where the similarity ends.<br />Prathima Rodrigues
B00005JLZN|3.0|Maybe you are dumb judge and jury? Maybe you are a foolish public prosecutor? If you guessed Bruce Willis was a ghost, knock a star of this review. Read this next statement carefully if you want to see this thing. All depends on it.<br />Kevin Spacey plays a professor who is against the death penalty because he believes it is faulty and there is a margin for error where innocent people may be executed. He has been sentenced to death for the murder of his anti-death penalty activist friend who was dying from Leukemia. He calls up a journalist - Kate Winslet, to come visit him on death row, three days before his execution to help prove his innocents.<br />To be honest if you have not figured out the silly plot twist by now then add a star to this review and go watch it. Half way through this movie me and my friend had to sit out the remaining hour to see our suspicions unfold. I am sure many of you will be doing this too.<br />Silly plot twist and glaring Swiss cheese holes aside - this is actually one of Spacey's better parts to date and he is back doing what he does best. Here he is a cross between American Beauty and Seven. He does perform extremely well on the screen and does some really good drunk acting. The script's dialogue is actually very witty and thoroughly enjoyable. However Kate Winslet does not really pull it off in the American gal department and when she starts crying towards the end, the film is lost. There is also some very silly emotional heart string tugging moments that do not work well. However for every bad scene there is actually a brilliant one. You will enjoy quite a lot about this movie. However when it's bad, it is a real stinker. The brain department in this movie is not on form most of the time and for some reason I came away feeling that the film thinks that it is a lot smarter than what it really is. And maybe that is where the problem is at.<br />So this movie is basically the benchmark for all 3 star movies. When it is good there comes along a bad piece to neutralize it again. When it is bad there is good piece to revive it. However when all is said and done it is more than a little bit silly and certainly goes in the direction of farce. What sounds like a good idea on paper, may not actually work out that well on the screen and here The Life of David Gale is a prime example of a bingo twist idea actually blown out of all proportion and certainly leaving the stratosphere for a taste of that pie in the sky. Seeing Kate Winslet's investigative journalist actually having to recreate a death scene in order to figure it out only begs the question - why didn't she get it sooner? Why didn't the judge see it sooner? Why didn't the jury see it sooner? And why did the pro-death penalty supporters not see it coming?<br />I'm telling you right now the twist is like disco lights just under one hour into the film. Up until then it started quite good. You may be insulted by this movie a bit... however maybe not. Don't say you haven't been warned.es along a bad piece to neutralize it again. When it is bad there is good piece to revive it.

B00005R87Q|1.0|I am just going to keep this short:<br />1. Irresponsible movies like this one which are geared towards stupid and impressionable teens are partly to blame for countless of traffic tragedies.<br />2. The acting (and I use this turn loosely) is so bad you actually think this is a SNL skit.<br />3. The plot is moronic at best.<br />4. The actual racing is not even remotely impressive.<br />5. How they made a sequel to this trash is more baffling than Astro-Physics.

B00005JM02|5.0|As a person who was born, raised and lived in Sydney all their life, I have to say this movie is perfect. Pixar got the look and feel for Sydney 100% right, even down to the sounds of Rainbow Lorikeets (brightly coloured parrots seen in gardens and backyards in the early morning) outside the dentist's window the morning the tank is clean. The view from the dentist's window actually exists, at the Zoo exit. Also, I have snorkeled on the Barrier Reef several times, and the Reef sequences are beautiful and look pretty much like the actual reef.<br />Real Aussie slang is used by the sharks and pelicans, not the pseudo-Aussie slang that Americans seem to think we use all the time. This was great to hear, and shows Pixar's commitment to authenticity on this project. The use of Aussie actors and not Americans doing bad Aussie accents was also a treat for us.<br />As for story, this movie is a winner. The dual storylines cutting back and forth moves the story at a breakneck speed with not a single boring moment. The devoted-father-and-lost-son theme is well told and never gushy/cutesy. All this using jaw-dropping animation. And how could anyone not fall in love with Dory?<br />As far as I could see, there was only 1 technical fault. The pelicans depicted in this movie are actually North American pelicans. (mainly brown). The Australian Pelican is all white with black wings.<br />But I'll forgive Pixar this single boo-boo.<br />Thank you Pixar for choosing our beautiful city for this movie, and an even bigger thanks for showing Sydney so magnificently and realistically.
B00005JN08|5.0|While this may be a typical raunchy comedy it does a perfect job at it. I was totally surprised to see the lil sis from Buffy the Vampire slayer play such a cool role. This movie totally hits on subects that people might be offended by like Hitler and the pope. But I was smart enough to realize that this is just a fictional comedy movie that was meant to make you laugh. So if you are a moron and get offended by these things then don't waste your money. It also has an awesome theme song Scotty Doesn't know by a band called Lustra. I think that was Matt Damon posing as the singer in the movie, unless he really did sing it I dunno. Anyhow I would totally suggest this movie to fans of American Pie, Old School, and any other raunchy comedy, you won't be disappointed.
B00007JVBI|5.0|I've been a Cat Power fan since the begining this is by far her best work. If you like this album try What Would the Community Think.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Have never met someone who has immediately known exactly who you are and then had to leave them. There is not a way to express that huge, gnawing, painful feeling in words. Sofia Coppola has managed to say it in a movie.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|This movie is supposed to be based on Patrick OBrian's set of 20 books.  The book \\"Far Side of the World\\" has the British ship pursue an American ship, not a French ship.  So, why the switch?  In the 20 set collection, most of the naval battles are between America and the British around 1810-1815.  The books have very little to do with France.<br />If this was purely a movie made up on the imagination of the people involved then I would say it is pretty good.  But, honestly,  can we allow the director/producer to distort a writer's work?
B000092ZYX|4.0|It is really hard to believe that someone would review &quot;hail to the thief&quot; when they have never heard the enitre album and then go off about how they 'don't get it' and repeat over and over again that Radiohead is a bad band in five paragraphs. Donald Duck is a loser that only listens to what corporate Disney feeds him...empty music to cheer up his worthless, angry life. <br />Radiohead makes great music, and Hail to the Thief is no exception. The album opens with maybe the most powerful tune of the album...2+2=5, which sums up the political logic that our contry now practices...and if you don't know what they are talking about, then you haven't been paying attention.<br />The rest of the disc is pretty much like everyone says, a cross between Kid A and OK computer. If you have never heard the band, go fo the bends or OK, because some people find it hard to jump right into Kid A or Hail.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have been reading the reviews with great amusement. I agree that you either like the movie or don't with little range in between. Holding either opinion does not define you as superior to the other side. As for the comments on Tokyo and Japanese, I think this movie could have taken place in New York or LA or London. It is about being far from home, and not being connected with where you are. I have traveled many times on a direct flight from the Orient to New York or Washington DC. There is always a disconnection beyond jet lag. At home I wear a shirt and pants to work. In New York its a suit. The daily concerns of New York are just not like those at home. Tokyo is just different then the US. Not better or worst, just different.
1878424319|5.0|If you wonder what can a book tell you about the way you live and relate to others, read this book and you will find that there are simple and basic principles that you can apply to your daily life that will make you a better and a happier person. For some people, the principles (or agreements as called in this book) are no news, if you live already following these principles you will confirm how important they are. However, if you don't apply these principles in your life, this book will be an open door to a new dimension that, if embraced, will make you a better and a happier person. Give it a try; it is a great read no matter what.
0553573403|5.0|This series is incredible! Contrary to what that other person thinks, the characters are beliveable, and the violence is not horror movie-ish. Martin has created a fully realized universe that makes Jordan look like Danielle Steel. The use of magic is not outrageous or overdone, it actually seems quite plausible. Yes there are dragons, but they don't speak, and are not an essential element to the story. (at least not in this book!) To summarize, please don't let that other review sway your opinion. Give this series a shot, I promise it's worth it.
0141301104|4.0|The Witches<BR>By: Roald Dahl<BR>Reviewed by: P. Tadiparthy<BR>Period: 5<br />In the beginning of this book there is a little boy who loses his parents in a car accident when he is about 7 years old. Then he gets sent to his Grandma to live with her. After a couple of days his grandma receives a letter that is actually the little boy's dad's will paper. When she says that they have to move back to his old house he gets mad. He knows his grandma doesn't like to leave her house, but he still goes because he has no other choice. When they get to their new house the grandma tells the little boy all about witches. She tells him how to recognize them and what they are like. Then the little boy goes wandering in their hotel and he finds a room where a meeting is going on. When he looks in the room their are a whole bunch of women standing there. He seems interested so he crawls in and hides behind a wall. When the women come and lock the door the boy gets a little scared. He is afraid that they will find him. The ladies take of all of their things and to the little boy's surprise, all the women are witches. They are having their yearly meeting about how to get rid of nasty little children. Witches think kids smell like dog droppings and their main mission in life is to kill all kids. This year the grand kid made a potion to change all the kids into mice. The little boy gets found and the witches change him into a mouse. When he finally escapes, as a mouse, he goes to his grandma and tells her all about it. He can still talk because his body was only changed. His grandma gets all scared, but he calms her down. Then the little boy comes up with a plan to turn all the witches into mice. He goes in the witches room and gets a bottle of the potion. Then, he and his grandma go to the dining area. He scurries into the kitchen where the witches food is being made. He dumps all the potion in each and everyone's bowl. He gets caught, but luckily, he escapes to his grandma. They thenwatch as the witches eat their food and turn into mice. His grandma and him move back to their old house and decide to spend the rest of their lives looking for and killing witches with the potion.<br />I liked this book because it was very funny. One part that I found amusing was when the boy said, \\"Grandma, I want to be a mouse.\\" I found this funny because they also mentioned that he wants to be a mouse so that he doesn't have to go to school and take tests. He just has to stay home. He also wants to be a mouse so that he can go anywhere and do anything whenever he wants.<br />Another part that I found funny was when all the witches turned into mice. They said, \\"Whats happening to me? AH!!!!!\\" This part was funny to me because all of the 89 witches turned into witches at the same time. When the witches turned into mice everyone started screaming in high pitch voices. They also ran around in circles like they were maniacs.<br />My favorite part of the book was when the mouse went in the witches room looking for the potion. I liked because it was very interesting. It told the reader that witches are smart. They don't hide something like that anywhere. Actually, she hid it under the mattress. She made a small hole and put them there. The mouse found it because his grandma told him everything about witches.

B000024D4R|5.0|Without a doubt the most underrated album in the Pink Floyd legacy, ANIMALS had three unfortunate circumstances thrust upon  when it was released in 1977.  Number one, it wasn't as accessible as the band's multi-million seller DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, which was still on the charts when ANIMALS was released.  Number two, the blistering punk movement had erupted and painted progressive rock into a corner.  Finally, number three, the album had the unfortunate luck of being sandwiched in between Floyd's two most popular albums - the warmly atmospheric WISH YOU WERE HERE and the double concept album THE WALL.  But despite all those shortcomings, ANIMALS is a solid album from start to finish and has gained some recognition over the past 20 years.  It is now widely regarded as one of Floyd's best works, as it should be.<br />Pink Floyd were always dark and cynical in their music, but they also had a tinge of beauty that was undeniable.  For ANIMALS, they decided to focus a lot more on the darkness and cynicism due to the subject matter, resulting in their most unfriendly recording.  Roger Waters' theme on the record is inspired by George Orwell's classic novel ANIMAL FARM (it's a great book, everyone should read it), by taking all that was horrible and disgusting about society and human nature in the late '70s and classifying the humans as dogs (blind money grubbers), pigs (totaliterian &quot;leaders&quot;), and sheep (the weak followers).  Lyrically, this is some of the best stuff Waters has ever written.<br />The album is bookended by two parts of &quot;Pigs on the Wing,&quot; which are both a minute each.  Despite their short length, these songs have really beautiful acoustic guitar and vocals.  It's actually a bit misleading, since the album is much darker.  I guess they wanted to be optimistic before turning pessimistic.  The 17-minute epic &quot;Dogs&quot; is a brilliant and well-written piece of music.  The lyrics are deep and thought-provoking, the melodies are stunning, and the band's interplay is tight.  Incredibly textured keyboard work from Rick Wright permeates throughout the song, complimented by simple yet consistent drumming from Nick Mason and raw, spellbinding guitar playing from David Gilmour.  The music effortlessly flows from dark parts, to heavy parts, and to mellower parts, and everything in between.  Just an amazing song.<br />&quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; is 11 minutes long, and sounds like a terrific leftover from WISH YOU WERE HERE.  More great keyboard playing from Wright is shown, but Gilmour's guitar definitely comes to the forefront this time around.  It also has a bouncy, playful rhythm that gleefully mocks the hypocrisy of the pigs.  The 10-minute &quot;Sheep&quot; is a combo of the previous two tracks, by combining the epic feel of &quot;Dogs&quot; with the energetic moodiness of &quot;Pigs.&quot;  There's some really awesome bass playing from Waters on this one, and the song does take a left turn with a really spooky mid-section before the end. <br />With five songs and three them over 10 minutes long, ANIMALS won't be everybody's cup of tea.  It's the band's least enjoyable album (from a musical standpoint) and the music and message will take a while to sink in.  But when it does, you'll be grateful, and that's what makes ANIMALS stand head and shoulders above Pink Floyd's other material.  Instead of pleasing the punk rockers, they rightfully followed their own path.
0767827716|5.0|For the most part this movie is entertaining throughout it's entirety.  These were the days John Carpenter was at his best, with other movies like Halloween  The Fog, The Thing, etc...  Unfortunately Carpenter is not what he once was. Christine builds suspense slowly with a very nice score and Carpenter makes you want to root against the bad guys here.  Well directed, Very entertaining.
B000009RC2|4.0|At the dawn of the '70s, there was a new musical revolution brewing.  As it turned out, many talented musicians in the jazz world were combining the complexity of their music with the power of hard rock.  Miles Davis was the first to do this on his groundbreaking late '60s albums, but the first full-time band to bring jazz-rock to the masses was the Mahavishnu Orchestra.  Formed by John McLaughlin in 1970, Mahavishnu Orchestra (named this because that was the nickname McLaughlin's spiritual guide gave to him) assembled a talented group of musicians to take what Miles Davis had started and blow it up tenfold.  The original classic line up of Mahavishnu was as follows: keyboardist Jan Hammer (who would gain fame in the '80s for composing the &quot;Miami Vice Theme&quot;), bassist Rick Laird, violinist Jerry Goodman, master drummer Billy Cobham, and of course McLaughlin on guitar.<br />Together, their 1971 debut THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME shook everybody to their foundations.  It was the first real jazz/hard rock album and has influenced pratically every musician to this day.  It was a surprising commercial success, and led the rock fans to see what jazz was about and jazz purists to see what rock was about.  It all came from this album.  And the music still holds up more than 30 years later.<br />The record kicks off with &quot;Meeting of the Spirits,&quot; which begins with some ominous keyboards juxtaposed by Cobham's explosive polyrhythmic assualt.  It then slow things down a bit, only to rise to tension-building heights thanks to tasteful rhythmic support from Laird and Goodman, and allowing McLaughlin to solo like a madman.  An excellent opener. &quot;Dawn&quot; starts off lightly as well and features some more soulful guitar solos from McLaughlin and a tight groove from Cobham, but it then segues into one of the most unexpected time changes I've ever heard.  It will really catch you off guard, and I don't want to spoil it for any new listeners.  &quot;Noonward Race&quot; is a fast-paced rocker and probably the most straightforward, but the speedy guitars, drums, and keys really make this song rock out.  &quot;Vital Transformation&quot; is similar in style to &quot;Meeting of the Spirits,&quot; but it quickly comes into its own, thanks to some nifty time changes and arrangements.<br />The 7-minute piece &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot; is my personal favorite on here.  It's the most versatile song on the record, combining distorted guitars, funky grooves, blues themes, and shifting changes to really create a stellar atmosphere.  &quot;You Know, You Know&quot; is a nice mellow song with McLaughlin once again taking center stage.<br />Pretty much, THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME has everything, however there are some flaws that can't go unnoticed, and are the main reasons why I cannot give it the full 5 stars.  For one thing, &quot;Awakening&quot; is an absolutely weak finale.  It's too short and seems very rushed and anti-climactic, despite featuring an awesome drum solo from Billy.  I think &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot; should've been the closing song.  Also, the ballad &quot;A Lotus on Irish Streams&quot; is a very dull song.  It lacks structure and the song just plods around aimlessly for 5 minutes with no goal whatsoever.  Personally, they should've fixed it up a bit.<br />Despite those two weak songs, THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME is a groundbreaking and very creative effort from a highly skilled ensemble.  I can't wait to hear some of their other material.
B00013F38K|5.0|Remarkable that it took this long to come out...<BR>This TV series was a defining moment of the times in the early 70's.  Though I have not yet gotten the DVD, I have seen all the episodes it contains.  No matter where you come from, no matter what you do, the ideas portrayed in this series have profound moral lessons and good entertainment value for everyone.  All I can honestly say is the world would be a better place if everyone was compelled to watch this collection.
B000002RXS|5.0|Callas, as described by Gedda in his autobiography, was voiceless in this recording and that she sang like a potato was in her mouth.  Potato, maybe, but this is a fierce portrayal, with just enough voice to make it come together.  The Act II aria is so fierce and fiery that it makes me want to be a flamenco (sp?) dancer!  God, I love her rendition!  The rest is pretty exciting, too.  I think we all HAVE to love the slap that Carmen gives the other tobacco girl in act one, it's hysterical.  Rather like a cat having it's temperature taken!  :)<BR>Gedda is, as always, the essence of French singing and he does sing with fire at in the very important last act.  I like the conducting, too, which is rather quick, opposite of Karajan whom I also like.  Too bad Freni wasn't Micaela.  She's my favorite goddess.  <BR>I very highly recommend this set.
0609610570|4.0|The author points out a common mistake that most people made in the organization: the blind spot of execution. The idea is simple: You can create world-class mission statement, world-class strategy, but if you have a low-class execution strategy, you would ended up low-class.  All through my working years, I have really seen a lot of companies provide lip-service for their strategy, without putting much thoughts into how the strategies would be implemented. This book is like a wakeup call for those CEOs who think they are too high up to do the dirty job of implementation.  It is time to roll-up your sleeves and get your feet dirty, Mr.CEO.

How sweet that great likes Tom Petty, Ravi Shankar, Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Paul McCartney &amp; Ringo gathered to honor him.<br />This soundtrack is truly one of the best albums of the year!!!! It has something for everyone!
B00014NE62|5.0|This is a stunning digital transfer and beautifully presented DVD. The film radiates a beauty that was never apparent on the VHS. The extras are (for once) enjoyable and worthy of release - the deleted scenes are interesting for an insight into the process of film production of editorial choice. James Wilby and Rupert Graves talk with candour - Hugh Grant shows yet again what an oik he really is. It's a wonderful set.
B000056PWV|5.0|This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films; one that is confined to only one set (much like his &quot;Lifeboat&quot;). This is a tale about a professional photographer, LB &quot;Jeff&quot; Jeffries (James Stewart), who is confined to a wheelchair in his two-roomed flat. He passes time by looking out of his window into the courtyard that backs several small apartment buildings. Jeff even give nicknames to some of the neighbours he watches, mostly to keep absolute bordem at bay. But things aren't quite so bad; he has a nurse who comes in daily to take care of him. Her name is Stella (Thelma Ritter). She makes a casual reference to his being a peeping-tom could get him into trouble for seeing things that he shouldn't see. And, even better, Jeff has a lovely girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who is a number of years his junior. High-class and beautiful; Lisa doesn't care that Jeff is living from paycheque-to-paycheque. Eventually, Stella's warning comes true. Jeff discovers that a salesman (Lars Thorwald played by Raymond Burr), could very well be a murderer. He calls his friend, who is a policeman, to check out the situation. His friend can't; not without sufficient probable-cause. Many rather nasty things occur that Jeff sees but can't explain. He enlists the help of both Lisa and Stella. <BR>I find that this film is very captivating and quite fast-paced. The ending is nail-biting. A must-see classic!
B00007BK2N|5.0|24 Hour Party People is a drama-comedy-documentary that displays the roots of the Manchester club, The Hacienda, which was the undisputed birthplace of rave.  Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) is a well educated TV personality who runs a small talk show that presents unknown bands and odd leisure activities.  Tony is also a big enthusiast of progressive music as he attends small shows by the Six Pistols and other big time stars before their break through.  This leads Steve to form a record company, Factory Records, with some friends that will help him promote unknown artists in the best interests of the artists and not the company.  The owners of Factory Records build The Hacienda in order to further their stars' success, but the club also begins to form its own drug culture as the new music attracts a young audience.  This culture is also known as rave.  24 Hour Party People is a witty take on how 20 years of music development in Manchester created a subculture that has been given large amounts of attention due to its link to drugs.  Winterbottom directs a well written story that mesmerizes and entertains on all levels as it provides notions of large and small proportions that offer food for thought leaving the audience with an excellent cinematic event.

B00005RHGK|3.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE THE FIRST DAY IT WAS OUT IN THEATRES. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT BASED ON THE TRAILERS. BOY, WAS I WRONG. ADVERTISED AS \\"SHEER TERROR...THE MOST SCARY, STYLISH HORROR MOVIE...IN YEARS.\\" <br />I figured, foolishly as it turned out, \\"HOW COULD THIS GO WRONG?\\" CLIVE BARKER (MY BRITISH HORROR IDOL) ACTUALLY WROTE THAT REVIEW!!! (WEEP, CRY, SCREECH!!!)HOW COULD HE?<br />ANYWAY, THE ONLY THING SCARY ABOUT THE MOVIE IS ITS ELUSIVE, DARK, SHAPELESS MONSTER THAT REMINDED ME OF THE WITHER CHARACTER IN THE GREAT HORROR NOVELS \\"WITHER\\" & \\"WITHER'S RAIN.\\" I ADMIT, IT MOVED AROUND THE WALLS AND CEILINGS VERY QUICKLY, AND THAT WAS SOMEHOW EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING FOR ME. ALSO, A BIG ROOM FULL OF BONES FOUND BY THE CHARACTERS WAS INTERESTINGLY GROTESQUE. BUT THAT WAS AS FAR AS THE TERROR GOT FOR ME AND MY COMRADES.<br />OTHERWISE, THE CHARATERS WERE BORING, THE ACTORS TERRIBLE AND THE PLOT PRETTY PREDICTABLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT FOR THE RENTAL.
B00006399Z|3.0|This is not the best album of all time or even the best Traffic album.  It isn't even an official Traffic album.  It was released to complete a contractual obligation.  The sound is horrible, which prevents any chance of this being a decent album.  Traffic has a much better live album called On The Road.<br />This concert was poorly recorded and the original LP sounded pretty bad.  The first CD release was even worse.  This new remastered CD is about what the LP was.  There is not much you can do when the original masters are bad.<br />There is only one very good song on the album, an 11 minute version of Mr. Fantasy and it alone might make this album worth buying.  There is also a nice 6 minute version of 40000 Headmen which is an added bonus.  Mr. Fantasy shines in spite of the sound problems, but 40,000 Headmen suffers a little.<br />Medicated Goo is just like the studio version on Last Exit, so it adds nothing new.  There are two Dave Mason solo songs that are nice, but there are better versions on Mason's solo albums. There is no reason to own these poorly recorded, substandard versions of these songs, when much better versions already exist.<br />Gimme Some Lovin' is a noisy, sloppy mess.  All you can hear is the theme repeated over and over.   The musicians performance and \\"interplay\\" is sloppy and seems as if the band members are tripping over each other.  However, if this track did have decent sound quality, it might be enjoyable.<br />This album was released to complete Steve Winwood's contractual obligation to release 5 records for United Artists.  At this time, Traffic was already recording Low Spark of High Heeled Boys for Island Records, but were afraid of a lawsuit if they released it before completing the United Artists contract.  Traffic was going to do a major tour, but settled on a few dates in UK.<br />This album was never released as a Traffic album.  It was simply known as Welcome to the Canteen, and was done by the seven musicians listed.  But, there is a Traffic emblem hidden on the label of a bottle of beer on the cover.  And this album includes all the \\"official\\" members of Traffic. The CD releases actually now say Traffic. The album sold poorly, partly because it sounded band and partly because Low Spark of High Heeled Boys was released shortly afterwards.<br />Traffic has had more breakups and reunions than almost any other band.  They broke up between every album, and reunited for the next release.  Dave Mason was an original member and on the first 2 ablums (in the US release, was not listed as being on the second album, even though he wrote half of the songs).  Mason was kicked out of the band 3 times.

B00006879E|5.0|This cd is great!  I would recommend it to everyone!  The catchy songs continue from track 1 to track 12.  Each one has a good beat, great lyrics, and great drum beat.  There are few cd's that are great from start to finish, but this one is!  BUY IT!!!!!
B00001OH1S|5.0|Right after seeing the movie, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. One of the best I've ever heard, and I never tire of hearing it- I play it so often! The music is silky smooth, and I loved Windmills, Everything, Sinnerman, and all the jazzy instrumentals. Caban is the only track I skip over, mainly because it just annoys me. I sure wish though, that I had the extended version I heard about...Because the cd doesn't have all the music from the movie!
B00005JM02|5.0|When Finding Nemo came out, I saw Albert Brooks on Late Night with David Letterman. Brooks, who stars as the voice of Marlin, the daddy fish, had taken his son (who, I believe, was about five years old, the equivalent human age of Nemo) to the premiere. After about five minutes, Brooks said his son leaned over to him, and quietly said, the way a grownup might, &quot;I cannot watch this movie,&quot; and walked out. Late in the movie, the son returned, having obviously been crying. Leaning over, Brooks assured his son, &quot;You are not Nemo.&quot;<br />Such is the power of this fish story about father and son clownfish who become separated, and must struggle to find their way back to each other. Marlin is a loving but neurotic and overprotective father; Nemo is a frustrated young fish who wants to be independent and see the world, and resents his father for preventing him from doing so. We see an ocean (read: the world) that is a terrible, heartless, and yet joyous place that we frail fish must confront, as best we can, because there's no alternative. <br />The animation was done by the wonderful folks from Pixar, who are the closest thing to the reincarnation of Walt Disney. There is simply no comparison between the animation of the typical, visually flat, politically correct, contemporary animated movie (like say, your typical Disney picture!) and Nemo. In Nemo, the ocean floor looks like the ocean. And the characters are all ... characters. They are all physically distinctive, wonderfully written, and performed by gifted actors who - if you'll pardon the cliché - will alternately make you laugh and cry. Of particular note are Barry Humphries as Bruce the Shark, Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the Pelican, Willem Dafoe as Gill, Allison Janney as Peach, and of course, young Alexander Gould as Nemo. Ellen Degeneres, in particular, steals every scene she's in, as Dory, a gregarious fish whose memory leaks like a sieve. But this is Albert Brooks' movie. He deserved a special Oscar for the most moving voice work my wife and I have ever heard.<br />Thomas Newman, of the musical Newman clan (Alfred, Lionel, Randy), has composed a score that is subtle and unobtrusive much of the time, but at dramatic moments takes over, and is more impressive, with repeated viewings.<br />Andrew Stanton's (Toy Story, Monsters, Inc.) screenplay, written with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds, brims with intelligence and wit (e.g., in an AA-style group of recovering - and frequently lapsing - sharks, the members intone, &quot;I am a nice shark, not an eating machine.... Fish are friends, not food&quot;), and Stanton's direction does not waste a scene. Every moment in Nemo will either charm you or move you. In fact, as my wife remarked, for all of its many comic scenes, this is one of the most moving movies you'll ever see. We've already seen it dozens of times with our four-year-old son, who loves it, and yet with each new viewing, we notice things we'd previously missed.<br />Note that the scene-switching between Marlin and Nemo confuses younger children.<br />The DVD, which has exquisite sound and color, includes full-screen and widescreen versions (which appear the same on our TV), and so many extras, that I'd need 1000 words, just to do them justice.<br />On a practical note, I find that the best thing about having two versions of the DVD, is that you can switch, when one of them starts to wear out and skip.<br />Finding Nemo is truly a find.
B000022TSW|5.0|Talk about a great movie full of good 'ole wonderful visceral scenes! This south park offering is totally hilarious.
B0000019HU|5.0|They all say they own it, but they just want to look cool. I really do own it. In the few months I have had Spiderland, all the tracks, at some time, have been my favorite. Listen to the lyrics on #2. They are scary.
B00000IQC8|4.0|If you look at this movie the right way, it is impressive.  In particular, it shows how to break into hollywood on a shoestring budget.  Does the script take a lot of cheesy cheapshots?  Sure. Which is a means to an end wrt achieving that &quot;entertainment value thing&quot; for the average viewer.  This movie led to so many others &amp; helped create enough real stars that it's almost a classic textbook example of how to break into hollywood without directly going through hollywood.  Think of it as a business model for those average people wanting to be in the &quot;business&quot; without going through the traditional channels (&amp; existing snobbery).
B00006JKOL|5.0|This album is simply the best by Jethro Tull, and certainly one of the best albums in rock history. <BR>Includes one of their finest tunes, Cold Wind To Valhalla. The masterpiece Baker Street Muse. Delightful tunes like Black Satin Dancer &amp; Requiem. The title track is awesome as well as One White Duck/Nothing is all. <BR>This is ART. Great fussion of Hard Rock and folk medieval english music.<br />Now, let me tell you how ridiculous are &quot;A MUSIC FAN&quot; from ILLINOIS and &quot;SARAH TAYLOR&quot;. <BR>Their reviews are the most idiot thing I have ever read. They think to have a position to analyze the music as if they are in Harvard. Poor the two of you. <BR>Obviously we are in presence of &quot;brainwashed&quot; people who spent their lives at school studying music and therefore they lost the sensivity to &quot;Feel&quot; music. <BR>I'm sure they can quote thousands of theories but they can't change a simple guitar string if it breaks. <BR>I'm sure that if they don't have Sheet Music in front of them, they don't know what to do with an Instrument, and that's the most RETARDED thing can happen to a musician.<br />A music fan from Illinois makes focus mainly on the lyrics, quoting a line, and then having conclusions that they are bad songs because he cannot understand that line. Well, this is MUSIC. So if the lyrics is such an issue for you to decide if the music is good or not, you got it wrong, probably what you are looking for in life are &quot;BOOKS&quot; not &quot;RECORDS&quot;. <br />I love meaningful and profound lyrics and the lyrics in this album are hermetic, sure, but won't stop me to enjoy such a piece of MUSIC.<br />So I'm giving 5 stars to the ALBUM because is a MASTERPIECE, and also 5 stars to these two reviewers for the most stupid comments ever ;-)
B000068TPN|4.0|I found the movie entertaining and for those who were not there, enlightening. I was really disappointed when the movie veered off from what really happened at the battle of the Ia Drang. There is no indication at all of what happened when Moores' battalion moved from the first lz, at the end of the first part of the battle, towards the second lz, where they were scheduled to be choppered out. That part of the battle was very different from the first part, that shown in the movie. The second part of the battle was even more brutal than that shown in the movie. Which is probably why it was just simply cut short. I would recommend watching it, but if you want to know what really happened, there are several fine histories available.  You should know what really happened there.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|wow. i have no clue as to the piont of this movie. it wasn't really scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't action packed, and overall it made hardly any sense....MY KIND OF MOVIE !!!! this was the most screwed up, out there movie i've seen in a long time. Frank is the best part, though. it's sort of like a mix between Terminator, and bugs bunny,.....anyway i can't really explain it so you'll just have to watch it yourself!
B000007638|5.0|I was all of 15 years old when Wings came to San Diego to perform this set.  My girlfriend and I had worn the grooves out of every Beatles LP my older brother owned, and we were absolutely awestruck at being in the same building with our hero, Paul.  We waited for hours at the entrance ramp for his limo to arrive, and when the entourage of 5 limos rolled in, they backed up on the ramp and just sat there for 5 minutes.  Tinted windows prevented our seeing who was in which limo, but Paul and Linda eventually exited right in front of us!  It was his birthday, and a fan handed his body guard a birthday cake.  Paul took the cake and sincerely thanked the fans for remembering. What a wonderful moment.  <br />Why do I bore you with this?  Because this CD captures Paul's warmth, talent and humanity like no other recording.  Sure, the sound quality could be better, but the body of work is stunning in it's diversity and scope.  The acoustic set is especially good.  Paul's false start on the opening notes of &quot;Yesterday&quot; shows a wonderfully relaxed and poised artist who is completely comfortable with showing a faux paux on permanent record.  The opening is absolutely CLASSIC as it builds in intensity.  <br />Don't miss it!
B00008EYA5|3.0|this was a good movie, but if you really want to see it- rent it, don't buy it. it was just one of those movies that was just...there. it didn't go anywhere, it just sort of ended and was done.it's worth watching once, but to buy it??...probably not.
B000002ADT|5.0|No jazz collection is complete without this CD. It's soul-stirring...Miles at his best!
B00003CXIP|5.0|This special edition DVD re-release of \\"Stand By Me\\" is of generally high quality.  The video presentation is true to the film's original aspect ratio (1.85:1), and is anamorphically enhanced for those with widescreen displays.  Generally, the video is quite good, but it is marred slightly by some unwanted (and unneeded) edge enhancement.  Fortunately, it isn't overly distracting.  In every other respect the video is well done, with excellent background detail which effectively captures the beauty of the film's outdoor environments.<br />The audio is mono, implemented as Dolby Digital 2.0.  A remix of the audio to allow for the use of the surrounds for some outdoor ambiance would not have been totally unwelcome, but what you get is true to the film's audio roots, and gets the job done.<br />The \\"special features\\" are excellent.  There is a documentary about the making of the film that features interviews with Stephen King, Reiner, and most of the film's major cast members.  It is a wonderful look at the production of the film, and one can't help but feel newfound respect for the job Reiner did in putting this film together.  Reiner's commentary is good as well -- it is very conversational and makes you feel as if he is sitting in the room with you, sharing the experience of watching the film and contributing tidbits here and there relating to how certain scenes were shot, or something amusing that happened on the set, etc.  Well done.<br />In all, this DVD represents a fantastic treatment of a wonderful film.  If you are a fan of Stand By Me, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in quite a while.  It's mellow and quite beautiful.  Not only does Rice play the guitar but he is also accompanied by an elegant cellist.  The songwriting is exquisite--heartfelt and emotional.  It's dfficult to describe the album.  It's raw yet polished, and everytime that you listen to it, you get the same serene and refreshed feeling.
0671015206|4.0|&quot;Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery&quot;: David Copperfield, ch. 12 (Mr Micawber). This is a somewhat oversimplied summary of the central thesis of The Millionaire Next Door.<br />Yes, the book is rather repetitive. Yes, the chart about the weights of various cars is silly. And yes, there are no amazing insights or foolproof &quot;get rich quick&quot; ideas. BUT: the authors make perfectly valid points, and the book is an easy, interesting read. There are many, many worse financial books out there.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I could watch this movie over and over without getting tired of watching it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.The Ultimate Edition is the best DVD to get and well worth it.
B000002H3E|5.0|I wore this album out in the 80's. A GREAT album. George Lynch-the man can just flat out burn up a guitar! Pick up Tooth and Nail too. Wish the band did'nt break up!
B00000JLWW|5.0|This another one of my all time favorite movies. This one is for sure worth adding to your collection. The DVD is much better than the VHS.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I thought this was a poor excuse for a movie, what a waste of Bill Murray's talents.  I had a hardtime staying awake in this one.  Basically, a snoozer!!
B000002UDB|5.0|You need to have this record primarily because of the collection of singles that the Beatles' US label appended to the movie soundtrack EP, which was side two of the original US album.  How can any Beatle fan be without &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; both of which were recorded at the outset of the Sgt. Pepper sessions and released as double-A single in early 1967...setting the tone for the psychedelic year of music ahead.  Had these two songs been included in Sgt. Pepper (back then, some groups frowned on putting a single on an album), they would have been two of the five best songs on the disk.  To get them, you need &quot;Magical Mystery Tour.&quot; You also get the other singles and B-sides the Beatles issued in 1967, the best being the anthemic &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; and the ingenious &quot;Hello Goodbye.&quot;  The movie soundtrack tunes aren't all of that quality, although &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (which was a B-side to &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;) is one more excellent example of John's acid-inspired surrealism, and I have to admit great fondness for &quot;Your Mother Should Know,&quot; which has one of those great Paul melodies that he seemed able to peel off in those days with the natural ease of an Irving Berlin.
0385510438|1.0|The ending is was a total let down.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok, I'm 25, still listening to Britney because her songs are real catchy.  I didn't like the CD when I first bought it, but after listening to it a few times, I got hooked.  My favorites on this CD so far are &quot;Shadow,&quot; &quot;Brave New Girl,&quot; &quot;Everytime,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; and &quot;Me Against the Music.&quot;
B0001906O0|5.0|In a recent interview, Robert Smith stated that he was sick of the mutterings on the internet about how there are songs missing off of this box set.  I have to agree with him... 72 tracks of the Cure, and people still find something to complain about.  This is an interesting, enjoyable, and fantastic look at a great band that would be otherwise unheard for those of us who were too young to collect singles in the early 80's.  Just as all Cure records, I shall treasure this collection of great music (especially Lament, Do the Hansa, Ocean, Adonais, etc).  Great Job Mr. Smith.
0783226888|4.0|Bruce Willis really is believable as the legendary Assassin by the name of the Jackal.  This movie takes you from Europe to the USA to Canada and back.  There are so many scenes where you bristle with anxiety due to Willis' intense manner.<br />This may be the best Willis performance ever.  The movie is violent, yet, it is to an extreme, not gorey violence but it reflects the violent nature of the legend.  Richard Gere is cast well, a little less believable than Willis, yet he does a good job of being intense in tracking Carlos the Jackal.  The issue here is what will Jackal do next?  Can he be stoppped?<br />Jack Black plays a very believable role of a somewhat bystander who meets a very violent end.  You may want to close your eyes for that one.<br />I recommend not drinking any caffiene before this movie because it creates an edge right from the beginning.  What was telling to me was that every interaction that Willis has creates tension, whether or not he is violent, you feel he may be at any time.<br />This movie of course is not for everyone yet it is not an action thriller that is silly in nature with gratuitous violence.  It seems more of a lesson of the violent nature of the worst criminals in the world.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|This movie is a classic, funny, action packed and really good !!<BR>Buy it, its great 5 stars !!
B00003CY0V|4.0|Swordfish has so many twists that you don't know who is going what and who is telling the truth.  The casting was great.  Hugh Jackman is lost in all of the confusion.  Who are these guys he has been hired by, criminals, drug dealers or related to the Government as they say they are?<br />Most interesting and intense is the scene in the bank.  The movie begins with that scene and flashes back to the events that eventually get back to the bank.  It is a very well done.  It made wonder, there is an explosion, a very large one, it made me wonder if that is how explosions really are.  Especially the ones of a murder bomber type.<br />Travolta does a good job as the leader of the group, and Halley Barry seems to do a good job, a little silly at times.  There is one scene that really was not worth being in there of a sexual nature.....however, such are our movies today.
B00008S2VG|5.0|When this album was released, I was surprised and annoyed at the lack of positive reviews, lack of radio spins and the overall negative reaction (or no reaction at all) it garnered. Surprised because after a first listen, second and so on, I was hooked to every lyric, every beat, every theme of each song. Annoyed because this album had been so wrongfully ignored and still is.<br />Now almost a year after it's release, I'm still awestruck at just how brilliant &quot;American Life&quot; really is. Unlike her contemporaries, Madonna has illustrated that the art of her music is more important than making safe, comfortable, carbon copy tunes. That's quite evident on this album. She could easily be churning out the same tired radio-friendly music that many of today's musicians do (wake up Janet Jackson).<br />Only time will prove how ahead of the pack &quot;American Life&quot; is. Ten years from now, the genius of this album will be all but obvious. So, if you enjoy safe popular music, don't purchase &quot;AL.&quot; If you have an open mind and are interested in a concept album that's lyrically and musically ahead of it's time, don't waste another moment; purchase this album.<br />&quot;American Life&quot; is only prove that not only is Madonna still relevant, but it also suggests even more brilliance from her in the years to come. I can hardly wait for what's next.
B00018D44U|1.0|So many talented women out there why concetrate in this one. Her CD was done in the basement of her house???? Buy Cyndi Lauper or Natalie Merchant CDs because those two women are much better and real artists. Damn the industry sometimes should be brighter.
B0000CEB4V|3.0|To me this was a surreal George Harrison concert. everything about it just showed George more than it showed any of the miscians up there. I loved it! I wondered why Eric didn't perform &quot;Badge&quot;,a song that George wrote for him. And not ALL if his friends were there. What about BOB DYLAN??? He was close to George. And it seems 2 me the only Python the George wasnt close 2 was John Cleese. Whats the story there? What does Tom Hanks have 2 do with them. But all in all in was a VERY moving, spiritual and emotional concert.They say George always wanted 2 have a concert like that. Its a shame it happened after his passing. At least there was the 1971 Bangla Desh concert (which I hope they'll release on DVD) But anyrate great concert but minus 2 stars for Bob Dylan and John Cleese.
B000003CKH|5.0|Seriosuly I can't count how many times I've listened to this CD. It's easily one of my favorite CD's, and I have never gotten tired of it.
0446530891|4.0|This book definitely has some strong moments in it. The idea is that a secret service agent fails and a presidential candidate is killed. Years later, the mastermind behind the killing is back and wants to kill the agent, who is now retired and trying to get on with his life. Another agent loses her candidate altogether, and now we have the beginnings of the story. There are some tangled moments here, but overall this is a good story. The only thing I didn't really care for was the ending. It seemed a little too comic-bookish. Why does the character stand in one spot rather than do the smart thing and move around to protect himself and his charge? Still, I enjoyed the book and would read the sequel.
0451169514|5.0|This is a GREAT novel. Stephen King has been one of my favorite authors for some time now. Every time I buy a book written by him, I'm just wracked with excitement. I received 'It' for my birthday two and a half years ago, and to this day, it is my favorite novel of all time.<br />Derry, Maine is haunted by the ultimate evil that comes around in twenty seven-year cycles. Seven misfit kids in 1957 find their way to each other, having one thing in common: they've all encountered this evil. They lose touch, and are reunited in 1985 to defeat It once and for all.<br />This 1,000+ page book touches on so many emotional issues, and it's so difficult not to be gripped by the power in King's writing. Each character is so real and multi-layered. Very highly recommended.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Gza is the most lyrically sound emcee in the entire wu tang clan, and im not picking favorites, he is not even my favorite member of the clan. There is almost no doubting his remarkebly easy flow and creavtive metaphors, which can either make you just want to hear more, or rewind it to hear what he just said. While listening to this album, and earing some of his unbelieveably creative rhymes, I wondered how does he come up with these, \\"Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers\\", is just an example of his creatvity. He has the ability to hit you in all types of places which has been a rare quality in an emcee since the beginning of hip-hop and is completely exstinct in today's rap. Aside from the lyrics, Rza, brings in some of his sickest and his most eerie for this album. Using experimentally spooky and out there sounds to create his unbelieveable beats which are always put together perfectly to allow Gza to flow right over them. Some of the best Wu tang beats of all time are on this album, perhaps many are. Gza also often credits Rza for his insane production, \\"my sword still remain imperial, Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial\\" showing he knows he is not the only reason this album is monumental.<br />As an emcee, Gza seems to make other rappers on his tracks better lyrically. Notably Inspectah Deck and Method Man. On the albums best song \\"Cold World\\", The inspectah virtually outshines Gza which is a complete shock considering how sick Gza's verse is. The inspectah seems to just be a bit hungrier,\\"No time to freeze undercovers roll up in grand prix and seize packages and pocket the currency, clicks control strips full clips are sprayed, Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay\\". Aside from whose better on the track, the two make the best tag team wu record of all time. However, its not just the lyrics that make this the best song on the album, the beat is also the best on the album, with spooky violins and drums which just flow so sickly. Another great tag team callobo is \\"Shadowboxin\\" featuring Method man. Gza does not get outshined on this one, though Meth throws in a sick verse. When Gza kicks the second verse though, he's hungry and he actually shows it a bit more then usual, he usually just seems so confident he doesn't have to be aggressive but his slight aggressiveness on this track is outstanding, \\"I slayed MC's back in the rec room era, My style broke mother_______ backs like Ken Patera, Most rap ______ came loud but unheard Once I pulled out, round em off to the nearest third\\". The beat on this one is also top of line, not as scary, more quietly aggressive, simple but not light. The \\"Oh man\\" every few seconds that chimes in is a nice touch.<br />One of the most creative rap songs ever written, and Im not exaggerating, is \\"Labels\\". Gza is able to tell a story while using the name of music labels, and he is not crediting them, more like he's dissing them. Never have I heard an emcee even attempt to create something like this, truly proof that he his the genius. \\"Investigative Reports\\" is another great track. It opens up with a sick verse from Raekwon. With U-god telling different reports during the chorus with a newscast going on in the backround. The beat is one of those that hit home, they go to your head and you don't hear the different instruments, just the beat as a whole, and it is a great one. \\"Swordsman\\" has a great beat that is mostly drums with strange sounds in the backround. Lyrically Gza seems to be trying to say something but he adds \\"I'm not caught up in politics I'm no black activist\\", so I guess it's more about self then political indevers. The final track is not Gza but it furthur prooves that success around \\"Liquid Swords\\" is contagious, Killah Priests raps the vastly different from the rest of the album \\"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\\". It has more of a funky beat and it's a biblical song, initials are B.I.B.L.E. Priest tells a great story of his childhood and gives out instructions before leaving earth.<br />Every time I listen to this album, it gets better. Everytime I notice something different whether lyrically, or musically. It is easily the best Wu Tang solo album and perhaps riviles \\"Enter the Wu Tang\\" as best Wu production period, well not quite. Every track on this album is bangin' with some of them just completely off the chains. Could be lyrically the best album I have heard, and it shows how much of an amazing lyracist Gza is. He never changes his tone which is affective because he smooth easy flow is so good he does not need to compromise it at all. Not only Gza made this album the phenomenom it is, much of its success is due to the producer, Rza. \\"Liquid Swords has it's place amongst the greatest of all time and easily is one of my personal favorites.
B000089RV6|5.0|Arguably AC/DC's best work. It stayed on the charts for a long, long time and is essential for any rock 'n' roll fan. <br />After Bon Scott's untimely death in 1980, AC/DC recruited Brian Johnson as their lead singer. In my opinion, this album showcases the best Johnson has ever sounded. How can one forget that screaming croak? That sings ON KEY? Amazing. Each song is unskippable; the riffs are awesome and in your face, and everyone does an excellent job on this album. The remaster displays wonderful sound, so do not hesitate to crank the volume up. <br />Personal favorite songs are &quot;Hell's Bells&quot;, &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;, &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot;, the title track, and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long.&quot; If you don't own a copy, go out and get one. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JLXE|2.0|ok. to enjoy this movie, you must suspend your sense of reality and common sense and believe the following things are true:<BR>(1) if you have a horrible accident with acid and you lost your sight, your other senses (especially your ears) will be so powerful that you can sense your environment better than anyone by emitting and hearing ultrasonic sounds like bats do.<BR>(2) if a girl doesn't give her telephone number, stalk and then beat the crap out of her until she agrees to go out with you.<BR>(3) the only newspaper New Yorkers read is the New York Post.<BR>(4) if you are a black man from Bronx, you must be a bad gansta who has enough fighting skill to engage in hand-to-hand combat with a superhero.<br />In short, save your money. If you must see a comic book movie, see Spiderman.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I am a full time Jew, and I watched this movie, and I was moved. I was moved not because the movie was exceedingly historically incorrect but because the score was awesome! Now I have read the reviews for this score and they all love it, but complain that its a &quot;copyright&quot; of the other score of the Passion. With me not hearing that version, I am not biased to dislike this version of the Passion. I loved James Horners Braveheart, and Hans Zimmers Gladiator. This is the first time I have listened to John Debney, and in my eyes, he did a great job! The movie would not be the same without this score. I would suggest this to especially anyone who LOVED Gladiator.
6305428298|1.0|You know, I'm usully not a freak out when it comes to outrage on  a movie when they abuse someone in the sake of comedy, but this one I just have to. I just watched this awful show on television. It is listed as a comedy and I don't see anything funny about it! An outright abusive, unloving ... of a mother and her gold digger boyfriend abuse and force an obviously troubled psychologically young girl into singing for their own ends instead of getting the girl into therapy! This show is awful.
0066620996|5.0|I'll keep this simple. This is a great book. The audio tape was even better. Jim Collins makes a great presentation. The concept Jim presents seems so simple, but would probably elude most leaders for many years. Maybe until it is too late in their careers or pursuits to make a difference. I recommend every serious person that wants to take their good company to the next level and stay there put this in their auto's tape player for the daily commute. You do not need to be a CEO to get true value out of this audiotape or book.  The level 5 manager is a no brainer. The hedgehog concept is easy to grasp but definately turns on your creative thought process. The flywheel brings it all together. The tapes total six hours and are hard to turn off, but they beat a six hour seminar anyday.
B0001AP12G|5.0|As Mos Def said &quot;Kanye West The Future Of Hip-Hop.&quot;<br />My favorite rapper, The CD is better than i ever dreamed. Every Song On Here That i listen too, THATS MY NEW FAVORITE SONG, ITS THAT GOOD!<br />If he doesnt get best artist this year i will for an investigation for bribery.<br />Kanye is undoubtably going to &quot;takeover&quot; like the song he made for Jay-z on the blueprint. Now that Jay-z has retired he droped his 2nd single off his debut album and reached number 1 the country for 19 straight days. If you think twista is responsable wait till he drops his 3rd single Workout plan.<br />Kanye has Toured With Talib Kweli and produced and made beats for Jay-z since The Dynasty Album.<br />I have been listening to his stuff off the internet and had Slow Jamz 4 months before it was released. <br />I have been trying to tell people that Kanye West is the best Rapper in the game. He free-styled over Jay-Z's hits and was clearly more talented. Yes jay-z the man we all know has &quot;Hip `Hop.&quot;<br />Kanye Battled Common Sense for 12 straight minutes and dominated Common from Native Tounge. <br />Some have said that this album isnt revolutionary. Thats because Kanye was making beats in this style for Jay-z long before he coped his own album. Although, his sound is revolutionary and completely unique. Anyone who says Kanye isnt revolutionary is simply wrong. He is and has been revolutionary to hip hop since `Jay-z's The Dynasty album.
B00018TI5E|5.0|What can honestly be said about this album that won't be immediately swallowed by the twenty-two other metageneric reviews which appear on this site?  I can't say that it is phenomenal: the album speaks quite eloquently for itself.  I can't say that it is by far his best work, for that is a matter of taste and an unanswerable question in the long run.  However, I can qualify this album (as well as every last inch of tape that John Frusciante recorded, even in the dregs of apocalyptic heroin binges, including the most grating sounds which adorn \\"Niandra LaDes\\" and \\"Smile From The Streets You Hold\\") as worlds better than the latest release (used here in the sense of releasing a bowel movement or a particularly acrid river of vomit) from the Chili Peppers, \\"By The Way.\\"<br />Chad is also in top form on SCWP (\\"Shadows Collide With People\\").  The rhythmic chemistry between Frusciante and Chad shines in a way that makes all of the lackluster Chili Peppers albums since BloodSugarSexMagic seem darker and duller than the cemetery sod which blinds the eternally occulate coffin of popular music.<br />\\"Carvel\\" is a marvel, the sharpest hook to dig into the soft flesh of a virgin listener's lips.  \\"Omission,\\" which Frusciante co-wrote, is a bittersweet ballad which sets the tone for some of the major issues that JF is fond of exploring lyrically.  \\"Regret\\" resounds with a melancholic melody; it is the pained utterance which dights John's lips as he emerges from the dark catacombs of his purgatorial past.  \\"Ricky\\" rises and falls, asserting that \\"there's a world in what appears not to be there at all.\\"  In \\"Second Walk,\\" Frusciante noisesomely stumbles back into his labyrinthian past, only to discover that each turn leads him down a hitherto unexplored path where vampiristic fame clings like a fat spider to its web in the ambiguous blackness of his mind.<br />\\"Everyperson\\" and the instrumental \\"-00 Ghost 27\\" (with its inexplicable name) are somewhat thematically tied.  For me, \\"Everyperson\\" is one of Frusciante's finest songs ever: \\"You know this moment in time / is all my life. / Everyday is each day that's past / Every person alive is everyone who's died.\\"  Then, \\"-00 Ghost 27\\" becomes the societal corpse, more like an empty coccoon really or a shell whose internal nut has withered and died, which dangles from the sorrow-soaked words of \\"Everyperson.\\"<br />And from then on, it only gets better, culminating in a moment I've been waiting to see for years: a Red Hot Chili Peppers sans Anthony, a \\"man\\" whose voice and persona have been ceaselessly corroding since his brief peak as a white rapper during the BloodSugarSexMagic days.  Flea plays upright bass, along with Chad and Frusciante on drums and guitar, respectively, on the final track, \\"The Slaughter\\" a fine culmination (after the early-era Pink Floyd throwback \\"23 Go Into End\\") to a stellar album.  Frusciante sums up human society as a slaughter: \\"It's blood / It's a flood.\\"<br />In other words, we have here an artist who, while being paradoxically an international superstar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, remains relatively unknown as a solo artist.  Even worse, he has been scoffed at repeatedly for the \\"poor quality\\" of his solo work (especially the early drug-ridden albums).  Today, pop music remains as the twisted fetus of a botched abortion, a constant reminder of the progressive degredation of American society in general.  John Frusciante represents the sliver of redemtion, dormant at the moment but containing the revolutionary prospect to erupt.  I, for one, would like to be there to watch the plastic pop princes(ses) melting and convulsing in the flood of fiery lava as it rushes down from the peak into the Valley of Death, casting a hungry, omnipotent shadow across the now-fertile land and reducing it to dust.
B000002UB3|5.0|Yes, as I sit here in my lair, annoyed at &quot;Banned and Censored&quot; (formerly &quot;Censored Reviewer&quot; and &quot;Duran Duran's Greatest Fan&quot;), I just think to myself how good the Beatles were, and yet again, I will say these two things:<BR>1. The Beatles did not have to rely on explicit video clips to gain success<BR>2. The singular tune &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; (Yes, one song...) is better than amything Duran Duran ever did.<br />And please! Where did those ridiculous popularity figures come from?<br />.................what?!!!!!!!!<br />( Duran Duran was merely another Hairspray-clad group that was following through with &quot;New Wave&quot; movement )<br />And also to then say that Duran Duran had more talent... WWWWHHHHHAAAAAATTTTTT???<br />The Beatles were so good, and really, the thought of Duran Duran being better than The Beatles never really came into my head (for obvious reasons...)<br />Need I Say Any More... Again?...
B00018D3RI|5.0|A great collection. I can't wait for the remainder of the series to come out on DVD. I would like a more indepth interview with Paul and David, Antonio and Bernie. Skip the other people! This is more than a story of 2 good cops, look beyond and behind the badge and you will see its a story of 2 men who are compassionate, caring and share a loving brotherhood bond. Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul.... THE ONLY STARSKY &amp; HUTCH!<BR> Thanks for a great series guys! You'e the best!
B00008RH1H|5.0|Widly considered as one of the greatest shakespearean film adaptations ever made. Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood is a very different adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal japan. the characters are somewhat different from shakespeare's version. It is no doubt one of Kurosawa's finest films made in the height of his career. Mifune is at his finest here as well. I definitely recommend this movie to any film lover out there who enjoys great storytelling and fine acting.
B000002U8G|5.0|I am what you might call a &quot;intermediate&quot; Pink Floyd fan. I have been exposed to a lot of their work, but have only recently experienced the musical journey that is &quot;Meddle&quot;. If you have any history with Pink Floyd, this album will render you nearly motionless in delight. But the real beauty of this album, lies in its ability to appeal to even the casual listener. That is of course, with the exception of &quot;Echoes&quot;, which remains the finest musical emulation of an acid trip to date. Personally, I make time (about 23 minutes) every week to rediscover the depth-of-thought, and utter madness that is &quot;Echoes&quot;. The album is worth every cent. But more over, &quot;Meddle&quot; is worthy of your time, and intellectual consideration.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Kurosawa's study on the nature of truth, of reality, and human nature is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made. it is the story of a rape and a murder and that is all we ever know that occured during during the course of this movie. it tells the story from the perspectives of 4 sperate characters; a woodcutter, a bandit, a man, and his wife. they all have different stories and we are never told who is really telling the truth. Because this is a story about the bleakness of human nature, the evil tendencies we have. but there is redemption in the end. according to what i've been told and have read this is the first film to have a shot that's pointed directly into the sunlight and to use light reflectors to help light the actors. it also gained noteriety for its phenominal camera work. I highly recommend you buy this this is a great film toanyone who enjoys an engrossing experience.
078322947X|3.0|William Freidkin fell into the same trap as Francis Ford Coppella by getting self indulgent with Sorcerer.<BR>Both men,after having hit films decided to get self indulgent and Freidkin almost pulled it off had it not been for some awful selections.<BR>Just like Coppella's mistake in \\"One From The Heart\\",Freidkin does not bother with a widescreen picture which would have improved this film immensely with the spectacular jungle scenes. And just like Coppella,he goes for music that doesn't suit the film at all.<BR>The electronic soundtrack from Tangerene Dream is awful and spoils the film. Oh,for a John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith orchestral soundtrack which would have made a big difference.<BR>The film does have some spectacular set pieces,like the opening scenes that include a robbery,a terrorist act,a fraud and an assassination. Other big scenes are the oil site explosion,the bridge scene,the gun battle with terrorists and the jungle scenes which widescreen would have improved greatly.<br />Some of the film is directed in a flat European style,which is kind of boring,but it does improve.<BR>The film is still interesting but it should have been much better if the right decisions had been made.
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is one of the greatest action films ever made. a group of seven samurai are hired by a village of famers to take care of some bandits that are terrorizing them, but the samurai and the farmers will have to overcome their differences and unite before they can get the job done.<BR>takashi shimura is great as the aging samurai who's seen it all. toshiro mifune is also terrific as the clumsy samurai who is torn between the farmers and the samurai. this is supposedly the first movie that a group is hired to take on a mission. if that is true then that is quite an accomplishment in filmmaking history with all the movies these days with a similar plot to this. you really need to buy this dvd, a truly great film
B000003S09|5.0|To echo a similar review posted earlier: I am tired of people talking about &quot;Moonchild&quot; and explaining why it partially ruins King Crimson's debut album, ITCOTCR.  The 10-second coda, consisting of &quot;random&quot; notes (and just how do you know if they're &quot;random&quot;?) adds a gutsy, unexpected twist to this marvelous suite--it conjures up lush imagery and a spacey/free-form feeling that many &quot;music&quot; fans can't understand.  I guess, to these detractors, that everything has to be a 3-minute pop song to be enjoyable...:p<br />As for the other four compositions: they, too, are indestructible.  &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; rocks and rolls like few others, with Fripp's angular guitar figure intertwining with screeching saxs, rolling drums, and Greg Lake's heavily distorted vocals.  When I first heard the song, I was surprised that it had been conceived during the 1960s, since it has a very modernist sound.<br />&quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; perfectly undercuts &quot;Schizoid&quot;'s terror with a wash of flute and pastoral guitar; it shows Crimson as an extremely versatile band with a virtuosic command of composition and instrumentation.<br />&quot;Epitaph&quot; is Lake's best vocal, and yet another haunting, brooding piece whose anxiety echoes, in a quiter way, the tension of &quot;Schizoid.&quot;  <br />The title track, as everyone else has already explained, is a gorgeous, medieval symphony whose 9 minutes seem to evaporate in no time.  It is a brilliant closer for an all-together brilliant album full of daring ambition, seamless genre-bending, and poignant musicianship.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Bill Murray cannot be considered a comic, this man is not, has never been and will never be funny. OK, so you insist he is funny?

0440237688|4.0|Jonas is a 12-year-old boy, although, he is not like you or me.  His \\"community\\" takes place in the future.  In Jonas' community no one can see colors, hear music, or make choices. Everything is peaceful.  No one is hungry or sick, or even different.  There is only one person in the community who knows how the community came to be.  This is The Giver, and young Jonas has been selected to become the next Giver.  Soon Jonas and The Giver are the only ones who know about animals, hills, emotions, wars, Christmas, and sled rides in the snow.  They are the only ones who know what happens when you are released.<br /> This book is an awkward and often difficult read if you like to read for enjoyment.  Lois Lowry's The Giver, however, takes a unique look at the mind of an adolescent put into an adult unique story of mind games and adventure, memories, and fear.   Jonas experiences all of these things for the first time and you as the reader get to see what that feels like.  As with many tales of future utopias, Jonas's once perfect world becomes a nightmare.  Can The Giver help his community understand who they really are?  Can Jonas find peace in a place called Elsewhere?  Find out in Lois Lowry's The Giver.
0385510438|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Juror.  Grisham successfully changes things up by writing in first person.  The character development is great, with several endearing Southern personalities.  The category of &quot;mystery&quot; would not be accurate for this book, though.  While the ending was fairly predictable, I was so infatuated with the characters by the end of the book that I did not care.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My wife got me this DVD.  I love it.  Gosh, there is hardly one thing I don't love about this DVD series.<br />Now, if you're thinking of buying it:  DO SO!!!  It's money well spent.  This DVD series is far better than Saving Private Ryan and that is not a bad DVD either.<br />I've been putting together models of German Armor for years.  On the set of \\"Brothers\\" they have reproductions of Tigers, Stug IIIs, Marders, and Jadpanthers.  The Stug was done so good it fooled me and only a DVD frame-by-frame analysis showed that it was a substitute, made of a former British personnel carrier.  But, what a wonderful substitute.  It is the attention to detail that makes you feel that the producers really went the extra mile in making this series.<br />I'll give you another example of attention to detail.  In 1942 American aircraft had a star with a red circle inside as the national insignia.  That marking was only vaild for 1942 and earler.  In 1944 the invasion markings on the transports were obviously hand panted.  That is also correct for the period.  The producers went the extra mile just to research aircraft markings.  Yes, people like me pay attention and this will add to your enjoyment of the DVD.  Tom Hanks & crew got it right.<br />Then there are the actors.  D. Williams plays LT/CPT/Major Winters.  What a fantastic job!  Darn, I wish my officers in the real military were half as good as Winters.  You never get over the impression that CPT Winters is a perfect American officer.  He's cool under fire, makes good decisions, and leads by example for his men.  Lt. Winter's mild words to an enlisted man, PVT Blythe, restores the man's courage and makes him an effective combat soldier.  What a leader!  Did D. Williams get an Emmy award for this performance?  He deserved it!!!<br />Words excape my frail ability to write about Band of Brothers.  Now, if you read the book \\"Band of Brothers\\" by Stephen Ambrose it does give you some important background information.  <br />Thereason why Winters does not drink (they make a big deal about this in the series) is he used to be a nationally rated wrestler in college.  So, Winters merely kept himself in athletic training mode while in the Army.  True athletes in training do not drink, it's empty calories.<br />I really enjoyed the action between CPT Williams and CPT Nixon, the 506th S-2 (intelligence).  The book does a fantastic job of showing Nixon as two things:  1.  he was a wonderful planner and researcher for the Army (a positive effect of Yale) and 2.  he drank too much (a negative effect of fraternity life at Yale).<br />Nixon loses the 506th Brigade job and the series makes a big deal about it.  This is a little different than the book because the war was winding down, another officer did want the job, and Nixon's drinking plus personal problems just gave an excuse to transfer Captain Nixon to Major William's command.  Remember, the European war was ending and the career soldiers were getting the plum assignments.     <br />I think the best part of the post fighting series is when Major Williams gives Captain Nixon the first pick of Nazi wine stash in Bavaria, Germany.  That was priceless.  Also, it follows the book nearly 100%.<br />Fellow Amazon.comers, you will enjoy this DVD.  The Airborne comes off as super tough volunteers.  The series shows good officers - like Williams and Lt. Spears (who is rumored to be a cold blooded murderer) - bad officers, and officers with problems, such as the ever drinking Captain Nixon.<br />This video is worth the money.
0156029065|5.0|Baudolino is an amazing tour of the 12th century, the value of lies and perception, fantastical tales, the creation of myth and legend, and the reality of language - A story of great depth and so some mischief.  Absolutely brilliant.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the secrets of a good film with a personal vision is that people who share that vision will love, people who do not it (or who'd be better served by The Terminator or Titanic) will hate it, but that it will provoke strong responses in all of them<br />Lost in Translation has over 800 comments, which are mostly either 5 stars or 1. Extreme enthusiasm or anger fit to be tied. One thing I don't understand is the people who use the term &quot;art film&quot; as an insult. There are no art films. There are good films and bad ones. This is one of the great ones. Looking at the negative reviews you can see the pressure placed on some film-makers to conform to the pap mill. Luckily Sofia Coppola doesn't. Hopefully she never will.
B00004WGAI|5.0|When I first read the reviews for this movie I thought it would be another movie that skipped several scenes and didn't use the dialogue from the book, but I thought wrong. When I got the movie on VHS I was first alarmed that it was going to be a long movie (its two tapes) and then I started seeing it with the book beside following along and I was surprised!  They used the dialogue and it started at the beginning instead of skipping to Lowood Institution.  The characters were excellent!  Mrs. Reed made me feel inferior and Mr. Brocklehurst was the epitomy of hypocrisy!  He talked to Jane naming her faults when in reality he named his own.  Miss Temple and Helen Burns would have made Bronte proud and Mrs. Fairfax was the gentle and caring creature that was portrayed in the novel.  Finally, Mr. Rochester!  Although he was handsome, Timothy Dalton played the best Rochester.  He was moody, demanding, passionate, and cunning.  His tricks with Miss Ingram (who also played the character well) and his passionate rage when everyone found out that Bertha was crazy and his wife, was the best acting in years. You could feel his love for Jane, and his want to marry someone he loves.  At last the ending was also the best!  Make up did a wonderful job cutting off his hand and making him blind.  A&amp;E did a version of Jane Eyre in 1998, and at the end Mr. Rochester was blind, but he looked as healthy as any other man.  In the BBC video he looked like a real cripple (he even scared me a bit).  Lastly, when Jane returns to him, it makes the viewer relieved and delighted that they will be together.  <BR>   The movie does have a few negative points.  Towards the beginning, the movie looks more like a Broadway play rather than a movie so you feel like your sitting in front of a stage which makes the movie less interesting, but it gets better towards the end. Zelah Clarke who does Jane also isn't the best Jane.  She's doesn't have the passion that Charlotte Bronte explains in her novel.  Zelah acts the part of a complacent and nun-like young child who has no thoughts or feelings.  She depicts some of her passion when Rochester proposes, but it wasn't much.  It didn't ruin the movie though.  Also, in the movie Miss Oliver is not present.  The movie could live without Miss Oliver, but without her St. John's character is a little vague, so if you haven't read the book it makes the proposal he does for Jane a little confusing especially since Jane and St. John's conversation is very little.<BR>   All these things effect the movie, but the viewer will still have the best time.  The passion, love, hurt, and sadness will be felt by the time the movie ends.  Its the best version yet!
B0000648WZ|5.0|This film presents a very intelligent and original look at a plausible future society that seems somewhere between libertarian and fascist.  Accusations that Verhoeven is attempting to make a fascist movie are absurd and insulting to a man who lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland.<br />Listen to his director's commentary.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I have a copy so listen up. I still think this was a mistake for me to buy except for the fact that I could sell this on ebay. It was a mistake because they might put more stuff when they release it again. They probably took it back because they probably wanted to make a ten year anniversary eddition, which would probably make it 2 disc. Also probably they wanted to make a commentary with Johnny Depp, where I got this from you ask? ...shhh...dont say anything. Anyways these special features are good too. It's also the first time you see this film in widescreen. This film can interest you in Ed Wood Jr, I have looked at his films and laughed very very hard. He is the best at making bad films. Trust me he is the king at making bad films and this film is very funny. I still don't really get why this film is rated R. They hardly say any bad words. Well either way when this film comes out again, buy it. Plus there's an Easter egg. Can't find it still, but when I do I'll let you know.

B00003CXB4|5.0|&quot;The Lion King&quot; is a great animated film.  It has a captivating story, a stellar cast of characters, and good songs.  The animation is beautiful.  The opening sequence is one of my favorites. It is a true modern masterpiece.<br />You probably know the story, so I'll skip the synopsis.  One thing that does bother me is that the editorial review says that this flick is too violent for the little kiddies.  What?  A simple explanation can put an end to any confusion or fears that your child might have, unless your one of those parents who use the DVD players as a babysitter.  My two year old understands that bad things happen in the world.  She might not understand that Mufasa dies in this flick, but she knows that Simba is sad and angry about it.  Don't let the PC police get in the way of letting your children see a modern classic.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras.  Commentary on just about everything, music videos, and even short explanations on the animals in the movie.  The &quot;Circle of Life&quot; video featuring kids from the Disney Channel is okay, but an obvious promo for the Disney Channel.  As usual, there are a ton of trailers for flicks coming soon to a theater or DVD rack near you.  The Safari game is one of the better games I've seen on a DVD.  Granted, the menus may seem confusing to some folks in the crowd, but if you take just a little time to learn how to use them(I picked up the general mechanics on one try), you'll find that there are a lot of extras worth looking into.<br />The voice talents in this movie are great.  Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas are perfect as Simba(young and old).  James Earl Jones was born to play Mufasa, albeit for a brief time in this movie.  Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and the gentleman who plays &quot;Ed&quot; are great as the sniveling sidekicks to &quot;Scar.&quot;  Ah yes, &quot;Scar&quot; is a perfect villain in &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  Jeremy Irons is downright vile as the jealous uncle.  His performance is flawless.  Of course, Nathan Lane stole the show as &quot;Timone,&quot; and Rowan Atkinson, as &quot;Zazu,&quot; had the driest of wits in this film.  The voice talents of the rest of the cast were good as well.<br />Overall, a grand movie worth owning.  Its a modern Disney flick in the classical vein, and that's rare today..

B00005JMJ4|5.0|What to do while watching: Try to guess what's going to happen. Meanwhile, don't miss the savvy sound track and fascinating glimpse of Japan<br />What to eat while watching: Sake from one of those square, wooden cups. If you don't own one, you could make one from scrap two-by-fours. How hard could it be? <br />Some people don't like it. For them it's not enough, somehow. Maybe it's too haphazard, too free from uproar and hysteria, too much like regular life. Maybe these are the people who feel that movies should be something far bigger than life--more like reality TV. For them, Lost in Translation is exactly that. That the Academy-Award-winning screenplay of Sofia Coppola hinges to some degree on an inaudible line might throw off viewers who like things to be simple and obvious.<br />Your friend Gooden tends to get grouchy, however, when a writer or director holds my hand too much. I don't want to see a family reunited knowing that I'm expected to cry. I like when a story ends before all plot lines are drawn to a close, like the final scene in Laurel Canyon where the protagonist sinks into the swimming pool, questions unanswered, or Memento where you leave the theater unsure what happened or countless other examples.<br />I like to reach the end of the film wondering about the characters in their world. Especially when I'm watching a DVD and I have time to look at the bonus features, which often adds fuel to my imagination's fire.<br />Lost in Translation is very subtle. There are several transcendent moments that tie back into the title without elbowing you in the side. Coppola's other work The Virgin Suicides stands in contrast. That film was heavy handed in all regards with broadly stereotyped characters doing things that were as predictable as they were melodramatic. <br />Obviously Coppola has matured as a writer. The uncanny Bill Murray shines as Bob Harris, an aging movie star well into the product-spokesperson phase of his career. He travels to Japan to filmwhiskey ads and finds himself sunk into deep loneliness. He does not like hobnobbing with the sundry Westerners who recognize him and around the Japanese majority in Japan, he is awkwardly blocked by linguistic and cultural barriers. <br />In the same hotel is Charlotte (the fetching Scarlett Johansson), new wife of an up-and-coming young photographer. She's come with him to Japan because she's just earned her philosophy degree from Yale and doesn't know what else to do with herself. Note that Johansson is a transparent, or at least translucent, doppelganger for Coppola herself, a young woman, born to a leisurely life, trying to find herself. Such is the woman we saw at the awards petulantly fidgeting with her Oscar. <br />Charlotte is clearly a brainy character. She takes herself by day into Japan to discover its mysteries and wonders. Nevertheless, she too is lonely with her husband gone most of the time. In a subtle moment, she glances at some polaroids of her husband and herself. In these photos, he is looking out of the picture at the camera, not at Charlotte. She notices this at a significant time, but the moment is simply what it is: no attention is called to the detail, and, in fact, the Mrs. didn't even notice it. <br />Both Bob and Charlotte are plagued with insomnia, and they take to drinking in the hotel bar. It isn't long before they meet and, charming as they both are, they start to hang out. They drink together and eventually have a nighttime adventure when Charlotte goes to visit a Japanese friend from college and Bob tags along. The all-night party takes them from place to place in a dizzying montage of Japan's hip cultural circles. At last, the two fall asleep only to repeat the adventure the following night. <br />The story sets up for a torrid love tryst between the young Charlotte and the mature Bob. In many movies, something explosive would have to occur, bringing sadness, regret, craziness, murder, or something to grip the \\"gimme-it-straight\\"type of audience member. But this isn't most movies. Both characters have their marriages, challenges and all, and Bob deftly sublimates the sexual tension.<br />The friendship, therefore, is very touching. The two teach one another very lovely and ephemeral lessons. I call this movie a classic because it has a sense of innocence and simplicity that I associate with golden-era films. There's an earnest attempt to portray several characters, two in the middle, with all their foibles. It's a film like this that one can enjoy like a good book. It can envelope you and change you with a soft touch. I look forward to Coppola's next work.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye is one of the hottest producers out right now.  But are his rhyming skills as strong as his production?  Let's find out.<br />1) Intro - Deray does a wonderful Bernie Mac impression.<br />2) We Don't Care - Catchy beat.  Kanye speaks on the struggle of most people in the ghetto that are trying to do better.<br />3) Graduation Day (Skit) - Deray as Bernie Mac again.....he basically curses Kanye out for offering \\"We Don't Care\\" as a song for the kids to sing.<br />4) All Falls Down feat. Syleena Johnson - Kanye does some of his best work on this song.  Possibly one of the top songs on the album.<br />5) I'll Fly Away (Skit) - This was totally pointless.<br />6) Spaceship feat. GLC & Consequence - Very addictive beat.  One of the best songs on the album.<br />7) Jesus Walks - Deep.  Although this album is somewhat contradictory, this song lets you know that after all is said and done, he's still only human.  The original was better, but he had to make some changes due to bootlegging.  And the beat?  Get out of here....the beat is sick!<br />8) Never Let Me Down feat. Jay Z & J. Ivy - Let me just say that J. Ivy sounds a lot like Saul Williams.  The song is very thought provoking.  I may be a little biased because I'm a huge spoken word fan.  J. Ivy rocks the spot!  Arguably the best song on this entire disc.  Again, there are some changes on this song due to bootlegging.  But that's a good thing in this case because Hova freestyles at the end.  Does it get better than that?<br />9) Get Em High feat. Talib Kweli & Common - This is probably the best beat on the album.  Talib comes in and helps Kanye bag some chickens.  I must say, Common rocked it.  I thought he fell off after \\"Electric Circus\\".  But after breaking up with Erykah Badu, will we see the return of the B - Boy that we saw on \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\"?  I sure hope so.  Also, Kanye has some of his best delivery work here.<br />10) Workout Plan (Skit) - This skit is both corny and unnecessary.<br />11) The New Workout Plan - Kanye does some of his best delivery work on this song too.  The beat is hot.....and you can actually do aerobics to it.<br />12) Slow Jamz feat. Twista & Jamie Foxx - A radio joint.  The song is hot though.  I didn't think it would work with Jamie Foxx singing on it, but I was wrong.  The beat is one of the best on the album.<br />13) Breathe In, Breathe Out feat. Ludacris - The album could've done without this song.  The first brick of the album<br />14) School Spirit (Skit 1) - One of the few skits that was actually kind of funny.<br />15) School Spirit - Another Brick.<br />16) School Spirit (Skit 2) - Pointless, and it wasn't even close to being funny.<br />17) Lil' Jimmy (Skit) - Again, totally pointless<br />18) Two Words feat. Mos Def, Freeway, & Harlem Boys Choir - The Mighty Mos drops jewels on this track while Free keeps pace.  Kanye even held his own.  Not a bad song.  The beat is a little flat though.<br />19) Through The Wire - The lead single.  Not bad.  You've probably heard this song already, I won't rate it.<br />20) Family Business - Another Brick<br />21) Last Call - Okay, forget what I said earlier, this song has the hottest beat on the whole album.  It's twelve minutes long, but Kanye is just talking to you about his very slow rise to the top.  He raps a few bars, then he's just talking to you<br />Overall, Kanye West has a good presence on the mic.  His lyrics are on point, but his delivery could use a little work.  It can border on wack from time to time.  The skits seem kind of pointless and unnecessary The content of his lyrics and the beats alone make the songs worth listening to.....the only sticking point on the album, like I said before, is his delivery.11) The New Workout Plan - Kanye does some of his best delivery work on this song too.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|It is amazing to read some of the negative responses to Shore's amazing score for the Return of the King. They are pointing out that You are missing a few of the themes in the earliers LOTR Soundtracks. What some of these opinions are missing is the POINT. The greatness of a composer is the ability to use great themes in different ways. Shore has accomplished this task in a remarkable fashion in this last of the trilogy soundtracks. If people want to hear those themes that are missing from this last soundtrack, let them listen to the other two soundtracks to hear those themes. Kudos to Shore for writing a lot of original music that brings freshness to Tolkien's story.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Despite it's 1995 release, I only recently learned of this simply brilliant caper / mystery / thriller film masterpiece.  It is extremely demanding of its audience.<BR>I rank it with the best classic mysteries, such as Hitchcock's \\"Rebecca\\", Welles' \\"The Third Man\\" and \\"The Lady from Shanghai\\", and similar films, \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\", and \\"Laura\\".  It compares very favorably to the more recent mystery standouts  \\"Chinatown\\", \\"The Two Jakes\\", and \\"L.A. Confidential\\", in both storyline and production quality. Sets are excellent. Every actor is superb.<br />However, the film it rivals most closely, in my opinion, is David Mamet's utterly absorbing, and demanding, and brilliant 1987 masterpiece, starring Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, \\"House of Games\\".  It's surely no accident that con and scam artists play a major part in each!  These are, after all, psychological thrillers, or chessmatches!<br />I dare anyone to watch both films, back to back, in either order, and not be emotionally and intellectually exhausted.<BR>And tremendously rewarded -- if not changed forever!<br />3/05/2004 JEM  END
B0001ENY6M|5.0|It's very easy to say that some movements, themes, pieces or even the whole score is very much the same to other works by different composers.  Listen very carefully to the music, not the feelings it gives you.  The music is drastically different in my opinion but other composers have done such a great job with their scores that it brings you that same feeling.  Listen to the transitions and the different kind of percussive instruments used then relate to the movie and you will find yourself a very thought provoking score.  Maybe it's not the music that sounds the same, but the lack of interpretation.  Debney does a beautiful job on precision which is a very hard thing to do with orchestral music.  Some composers often fill in transitions with less dramatism but this piece, particularly in &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, does a great job with timing of entrances and cut-offs in different movements.  Though there are some times one movement feels out of place with the one before it, you quickly get lost in the wonder that is the score, even more so the movie.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is one of those movies that simply requires a second viewing (and perhaps a third) before the true meaning can be seen clearly.  However, that doesn't mean that the first time around is dull.  This film is dark, twisted, funny, sad, well-acted, and, above all else, like nothing you've seen before, or will see again.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character seamlessly, which, considering the complexity and ultimate weirdness of Donnie, is a tremendous accomplishment.  I loved the ending, and the way that all of the characters were a touch strange.  Drew Barrymore did an excellent job at creating a meaningfull, in not large, character.  The story line, and I mentioned, takes a severe twist at the end and is complicated throughout, but you'll love it the first time, even if some things are unclear until the next.
B00005AQE8|5.0|TUPACS ALL EYEZS ON ME CD IS DEFINETLY THE BEST MUSIC INVESTMENT THAT I HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME. I FEEL REALLY GOOD WITH MY SELECTION AND AM TOTALLY PLEASED WITH MY PRODUCT PURCHASE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANY AND ALL TUPAC FANS.
B00005RES9|5.0|Based on Charles Neider's Novel,&quot;The Authentic Life of Hendrick Jones&quot;, this is truly the finest Western you will ever see. It even surpasses &quot;Shane&quot; and that is a true compliment,indeed. Beautiful scenery, an absolutely intrigueing story with many unexpected turns that will hold you to your seat. As for Brando and a marvelous supporting cast,Karden Malden,Pina Pellicer,Ben Johnson,a fabulous performance by Katy Jurado, and others,see it, you will love it. Not often mentioned in reviews is the wonderful theme song by Hugo Friedhoffer as  background music.Absolutely a MUST SEE-to be chewed and digested.
B00005UKKF|1.0|In her Live in Las Vegas get up Britney Spears should be crowned princess of lip-syncing not pop princess. Watching and hearing this is just like closing your eyes and listening to her CDs at home. She maybe live to the sight of eyes but the vocals aren't one bit live in this DVD or any other performance she has ever done. A big fat F on this DVD and this performer.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|To call this movie minimalist would be kind. There is about as much thought in story and character as a 30 second Coke commercial. If it wasn't for Bill Murray and his talent to improvise there would be no movie at all. The director has about as much vision as a UC film school freshman.  Cut the constant establishing shots of the city and the movie would barely make sixty-minutes. She obviously doesn't have the slightest idea or interest either in fashioning an ending to her pedestrian plot. This film was obviously made the old fashion way; pure unadulterated neoptism. Rent &quot;School of Rock&quot; instead for a laugh a minute evening.
B00005JMF6|3.0|Joel Silver/Robert Zemeckis company \\"Dark Castle Entertainment\\" gives us the fourth picture that is probably inspired by Joan Crawford's cult horror \\"Strait-Jacket, directed by, yes, William Castle, the king of the gimmicks.  As you see, instead of powerhouse performance of Crawford, \\"Gothika\\" features another Oscar winner Halle Berry as the tormented heroine of the film, who must uncover what ever really happened to herself.<br />I warn you.  The story is impossible though intriguing.  Halle Berry's psychiatrist Dr. Miranda Grey encounters a strange little girl on the way home in the hard rain.  Then, she finds herself in the mental institute, where she is told that her husband is brutally killed at her house, and she is arrested for the murder about which she remembers nothing.  Then, during the time waiting for the trail, Miranda experiences weird things -- writings on the wall, for starters -- and she begins to believe somebody is trying to contact her from another world.  But who is that, and why?<br />The story so far is not particularly original, but thanks to the great photography of Matthew Libatique (\\"Pai\\") and production designs (by Graham 'grace' Walker, \\"Ghost Ship\\"), the first half of \\"Gothika\\" goes fairly well, with occasional chills and scares.  <br />The spooky atomosphere, however, begins to disperse in the second half, in which the director seems to have decided to do something different than the Gothic thriller.  Some scenes looks as if coming from the outtakes of action films (bringing back the memory of Ms. Berry as a Bond Girl), and the final chapter is simply a letdown, too predictable and familiar.<br />The director is Mathieu Kassovitz. of \\"Crimson Rivers\\" fame (but best known as an actor, the love interest in \\"Amelie\\"), and like \\"Crimson\\" he puts style over substance.  This is an  atmospheric film, in which the logics mean nothing but the excuse for the film to hold on more than 90 minutes.<br />Actors are not bad, not great, just good.  Robert Downey Jr. is, as he always is, a reliable support who could be either comic or suspicious, and Penelope Cruz is cast against the type as one of the inmates of the institute.<br />\\"Gothika\\" is beautiful, I mean \\"beautiful\\" in terms of Gothic fashion.  Pity that it cannot remain so until the over-the-top conclusion.
0689859368|5.0|I own and have read all of these books.  Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi are truly remarkable because of the way that they have incorporated the connection to the illustrator Arthur Rackham and his wonderful world of \\"little folk\\".  If you are not familiar with Rackham, I encourage you to research that and then you may find out why the reference to an individual named Arthur pops up in each book...

B0001BKAEY|1.0|The bros made one of the best films ever made (in my opinion) with the first film.Imagine the anticipation for star wars, it being awful and then watching the matrix the same week and just being blown away? that was how it was for me. A not entirely original universe had been created by the bros, combining a compelling and deep story line along with groudbreaking action and effect sequences. Millions upon millions must have been excited about the second movie. And what a let down in was. It dragged and dragged, and the zion sequences were almost embarrising. If being a survivor means growing dreads and going to a rave each night, well i think i would rather pass.....<BR>then came the third. I really hoped they would have learned from the previous film, but unfortunately, what they produced was a film way worse than the 2nd. I would advise any matrix virgin to just watch the first one and not bother with the rest.
6305897786|4.0|Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a book hunter.  He finds rare and valuable old books and sells them.  He has no scruples and doesn't mind ripping off clients or lying to them to make them think that their collection is both more valuable and/or less valuable than it really is.  Corso does not really have morals and doesn't believe that God and Lucifer still have power in this world.  So when Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) approaches Corso and asks him to authenticate a rare book purportedly written by Lucifer himself, Corso takes the job.  Within hours of his acquiring Balkan's copy, Corso's friend is dead and he is being propositioned by Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) whose husband originally owned Balkan's copy.  Corso briefly entertains the notion of backing out, but Balkan's promise of more money keeps him on the job.<br />Once Corso has a chance to examine the book, he notices that 2 of the illustrations in the book are signed &quot;LFR&quot; instead of by the original artist.  Intrigued, he approaches Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor), a rare book collector who owns one of the other 2 copies of the book.  Sure enough, once he has examined it, he notices that 2 different illustrations with subtle, but telling differences were signed &quot;LFR&quot;.  Unfortunately, Fargas is unwilling to part with the book and throws Corso out when he discovers who he is.  But Corso is not so easily dissuaded and, when he returns the following morning, he finds Fargas dead and takes the book.  He then travels to Paris to see Baroness Kessler's (Barbara Jefford) copy, but she refuses to even let Corso see the book, until he explains the differences in illustrations.  She turns up mysteriously dead also and Corso finds himself with all three copies and all of the illustrations labels &quot;LFR&quot;.  Supposedly Corso now has all that he needs to summon Lucifer and gain some of his power, but he doesn't believe in stuff like that, does he?<br />The Ninth Gate is one of those utterly creepy movies that you both love and you hate.  I loved Johnny Depp's performance in this movie.  He was simply amazing in the way he took this character who is scum and made you care for him and made you like him and want him to win.  He starts off bad and he ends up worse, yet I felt myself urging him on and hoping he would end up the winner.  Roman Polanski did a superb job in making everything look threatening and mysterious.  He also throws off the viewers by adding in random things like Emmanuelle Siegner, a girl who follows Corso around.  You never know if she is a friend or a foe or exactly what she is, but you know that she is definitely not a &quot;good&quot; person.  Wojciech Kilar's music was very influential in the film and really makes your flesh crawl with his mesmerizing theme to the film.  However, the movie is missing a tight plot and it kind of meanders around and so you are never quite sure if you understand what is happening or not.  Also, I was not interested in learning about demonology and found the whole idea of conjuring up Lucifer to be ludicrous, but I was fascinated by the movie nonetheless.

B0001611DI|5.0|This is a great movie on its own merit; why create a remake which, while it will surely have superior special effects, is almost certain to be infoerior without the creative genius of Romero behind it?  This disturbing trend of remaking horror movies, and updating them with a bunch of lame hip characters and cheesy soundtracks a la the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre with teenybopper Jessica Biehl, is very annoying.  Remaster and re-release this classic to the theatres instead.  But since they are not going to do that, be sure and check out this DVD, the movie is one of the great pieces of horror of all time.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok, I'm 25, still listening to Britney because her songs are real catchy.  I didn't like the CD when I first bought it, but after listening to it a few times, I got hooked.  My favorites on this CD so far are &quot;Shadow,&quot; &quot;Brave New Girl,&quot; &quot;Everytime,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; and &quot;Me Against the Music.&quot;
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Wow. This movie was a surprise. I went and saw it in the theaters with a couple of friends on a Saturday night when we had nothing to do. I didn't expect much. I hadn't heard of the director. It's got the guy from Felicity in it (Scott Speedman). And it looked like a Blade rip-off. I thought the premise sounded cool &amp; I love Kate Beckinsale. But, I thought it wasn't going to be very good regardless. Was I ever wrong!!!<br />Now don't get me wrong....this isn't the type of flick that wins oscars. And it's not even a movie that everyone seems to like. There is just something about the story, how it was shot, the characters, and the look &amp; style of the film that appeals to me.<br />The story of vampires vs. werewolves is an interesting one. Apparently there has been a war between the two covents for centuries. And it's been happening right under our noses. Kate Beckinsale plays a &quot;Death Dealer&quot;. Basically she is a hunter of werewolves. Thought to have almost been driven to extinction, the lycons (werewolves) have been living in the sewers and plotting a way to eliminate the vampires. When the lycons try to capture a human (Speedman), Selene (Beckinsale) tries to figure out why. Much action and killing insues.<br />This is a combination of a Blade &amp; Matrix rip-off. Not so much in storyline or plot as in style and how the action scenes are shot. The special effects are done pretty well. They tried to use practical effects as much as possible, to keep the budget down and make it look more realistic. I found this to be a plus. The storyline is quite interesting, espcially when Selene awakens Viktor, the oldest and most powerful vampire.<br />The acting here is decent, with Beckinsale doing the best job of the bunch. I know some other reviewers would disagree with that comment, but she did what she could with what she had. This movie is not about award-winning acting. It's about killer gunfights and looking good while in them. This film has style and sleekness dripping from it. The movie never gets slow, even though it clocks in at a little over 2 hrs. <br />I know some people weren't impressed with this movie at all. But, I just went to the theater expecting nothing and got everything I could ask for my seven dollars. I can tell I probably like this movie more than some people would. But, if you are looking for a fun way to spend the evening, you could not go wrong renting this movie. I highly recommend this for a purchase, but if you are unsure give it a rental and then decide for yourself. I just hope they make a sequal.<br />The DVD features are kind of disappointing, however. The featurettes are ok, but nothing great. There are also two commentaries, trailers, &amp; a music video. I wasn't expecting a whole lot here either, but the featurettes feal more like fluff than anything else.

0767803434|5.0|When President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) goes off of the regular script at an international dinner and announces that the United States will not bargain with terrorists in any fashion, he has no idea that his challenge will soon be put to the test.  On his way home from Russia, after his remarkable pronouncement, Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).  They are determined to win the freedom of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a military leader who murdered thousands of people in his bid for power.  The secret service agents on the plane sacrificed themselves to get the President into the escape pod in the belly of the plane, leaving the President's closest advisors, as well as his wife and daughter, at the mercy of the terrorists...<br />Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) immediately tries to negotiate with the terrorists to get the hostages off the plane alive while the military follows the beacon to the president's escape pod.  Everything changes when the escape pod is found - empty.  President James Marshall never left the plane and he is determined to make the terrorists pay.  However, the terrorists quickly notice that their numbers are dwindling and assume that there is a secret service agent loose on the plane.  They begin killing hostages in the hopes that they will find one that matters enough to the unknown man for him to give himself up.  With the clock ticking and increasing numbers of hostages being murdered, President Marshall soon finds that he is forced into negotiating with the terrorists and arranging for the release of General Radek from prison.  But that doesn't mean that he is beaten as he uses every trick in the book to get the terrorists off his plane...<br />Air Force One is a great movie.  It is fast paced, full of action and you almost instantly identify with the characters, especially Harrison Ford, as we have seen him play the president so many times that it is instantly believable.  It is true that many of the details of the movie are obviously fantasy, such as the mythical escape pod (that doesn't exist on the real Air Force One), the ease with which the terrorists boarded the plane, and the constant firing of weapons on the plane without ever puncturing anything important, but the director is so talented and the cast so believable that you don't really think of any of this until after the movie is over.  This is a big-budget blockbuster action adventure film at its very best!.

B0001611DI|1.0|WOW! This is the worst film you will ever see,which is a shame because the premise is cool. The Makeup is amatuer and phony looking! The horror movies from the 1930's had better make up for crying out loud! 28 Days later was lousy but is a masterpiece compared to this crap! For the first hour of the film you will laugh if you havent fallen asleep by then.   The only great Zombie film is \\"White Zombie\\" with Bela Lugosi!
0385504209|3.0|I was really expecting this book to rock the house.  I enjoyed Angels and Demons, and especially liked Robert Langdon.  While The Da Vinci Code has some cool ideas, I didn't care one iota.  Langdon became this incredibly passive and boring character with not much to do other than solve a puzzle with his brain whenever the story needed to move on.  There were way too many characters that I didn't care about.  Instead of spending time with Silas the not very scary Albino, I wanted more Langdon and Sophie.  And what's with the 2 page chapters?  I hope Mr. Brown's next book is a bit &quot;deeper&quot;, and more engaging.
0156027321|3.0|Quite a number of friends of mine have raved about this book.  Having read it, I am sorry to say I am a bit disappointed.  The author tried to imitate the &quot;exotic&quot; and fashionable writing of some Indian authors.  For the same type of writing, I would rather read &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; by Arundhati Roy, which I find mesmerizing and totally enjoyable.  Pretending to be &quot;exotic&quot; and &quot;fashionable&quot; through superficial references to food and dishes from a faraway land, does not cut it with me.  It lacks authenticity and comes across as pretensious.<br />Pi's less than conventional religious practices are interesting but ultimately not so groud breaking that it makes you look at life and religion differently.  I personnally know of many people who practice more than one religions.  The author picked up on an intereting theme but failed to bring it to a higher level of discussion.<br />The two alternative endings are unexpected and does give the readers food for thought which makes this book more interesting than I would thought of it.<br />This is an interesting albeit pretensious book.  I am still not sure whether this merits the Booker Prize.
B0000AQZYM|3.0|One of the most overhyped animated movies of the last years, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a visual delight, presenting a competent (if somehow predictable) all-ages story that manages to entertain and offer a few surprises along the way. It`s a worthwile and funny film with some hilarious moments (the sharks are great and way clever idea, as is Dory`s character, which prove that Pixar`s creators still have a couple of witty and innovative concepts). However, it`s far from being the masterpiece that so many claim it to be. It doesn`t bring nothing new aside from some visual delights, given that the storyline follows the classic Disney pattern (thankfully, it avoids the dull songs and the over-the-top cheesy moments). As a whole, though, it works rather well, combining its elements to provide an engaging and convincing cinematic experience.   <BR>Worth finding.
B0001611DI|5.0|Let me first say that the quality of this DVD is amazing. Never have I seen a dated film such as this restored to such perfection. The film is so clear, you will feel that you can reach out and touch the characters. The sound is just as excellent. The \\"Divimax\\" HD transfer is again, something to see and hear in order to believe.<br />That being said, this is the greatest all time classic zombie flic. And you wont regret buying this DVD. 5 Stars.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I purchased this at the recommendation of a friend, but waited a couple of weeks to see it.  When I finally viewed it, I was very pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable and moving it is.  Now I will recommend it to friends as well.  <br />It was great to see all of the different musicians together, some of whom (Joe Brown) I had never heard of before. Some of my favorite performaces were &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; &quot;Wah Wah,&quot; &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;Isn't It a Pity,&quot; and &quot;Something.&quot;  I also really enjoyed &quot;Handle With Care,&quot; which I haven't really heard since I was in middle school.  <br />As has  mentioned in previous posts, it was rather eerie to see how Dhani has  the same shy handsomeness as his father.<br />It is nice to watch the concert both in the movie version and as how the complete concert was orignally staged.  One good thing about viewing the complete concert is that you can somewhat sense how the arena built up emotionally during the latter portion of the concert, and that really makes the finale - Joe Brown singing &quot;See You in My Dreams&quot; very touching.  I must say that at the end that I shed a couple of tears and -although he will not admit- it my husband's eyes did get glassy.<br />Really, a fantastic concert DVD!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|There have been tons of albums I have looked forward to from bands I love that have totally dissapointed me.  This isn't one of them. I love everything about this album and every song on here.  There isn't another way to put it. I am NOT calling this album earth shattering, or genius, or a step forward or backwards (or in any direction for that matter). I am simply calling it fantastic. Pick this up along with 'Is This It', and play them back to back (you can because there isn't a weak track on either of them). You get what amounts to a very enjoyable double record. <br />And to everyone who is complaining that this record is just more of the same, I say this: Come on.  When was the last time you listened to an album and said to yourself, &quot;Well, the songs are well written, catchy, well played, and fun to listen to but it's lacking progress. I need progress from my music!&quot;  If you answered yes to this, I am terribly sorry for offending you, for the other 99% of the population, buy this album now. Progress? No. But if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I don't want to simply restate what everybody else has written, but I want to address a couple of points about this movie.<br />The pacing---If you know ahead of time that you will be watching something very slow, then this probably won't be a big deal. Just be sure to watch it at a time when you can handle the deliberate speed.<br />The acting---It's all pretty good. Bill Murray does pretty much the exact same role as he had in &quot;Rushmore,&quot; only without as much charm.<br />The romance---This is definitely not one of the greatest love stories ever. The two main characters are both so uninteresting, their love is so inexplicable that there isn't much reason to hope they get together. Watching them fall in love with each other is sort of like viewing a nature documentary on the mating rituals of slugs. It just feels so, so wrong the entire time--there aren't any sparks or fireworks or rushes of joy in the movie. People like to say that the love story is great because it is &quot;subdued&quot; rather than forced like a typical movie. That's all well and good, but the romance in here isn't &quot;subdued&quot;--it's beaten with a tack hammer, gagged, blindfolded, and then sedated with 4000 cc's of horse tranquilizers. The ending is the only good part of their story.<br />The script---This is the biggest problem with the movie. The script is so poorly written that I cannot fathom why it won an Oscar. The humor is about as low-quality as you can get, and often wanders into what I would call racist territory. Another customer here commented that many of the jokes hinge on the fact that the Japanese mix up l's and r's. It turns out that about three-fourths of all the &quot;jokes&quot; in the movie are just scenes where the main characters sit around and poke fun at the Japanese. It is a sad, sad movie when the most brilliant joke in the movie is, &quot;What? LIP them? Don't you mean RIP them?&quot;<br />To be fair, however, the movie does have many beautiful shots.The direction is actually very good, no matter what the speed of the movie might be. The acting, as I said, is generally pretty good. In fact, everything in the movie that ISN'T the script is generally pretty good. It's such a shame that all of this was ruined by awful jokes and lame dialogue.
0553212737|4.0|Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.<br />Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.<br />One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?  <br />Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Beware.  This release is a double edged sword.  Yes the extra interviews that are added and bonus features are great  (Especially the original release).  The problem is what we are missing by having the new footage added into the excellent original cut.  And what is that? The band playing in Pompeii!  The thing that the whole movie was originally about.  The shots of  dave and Nick doing their vocals in the studio could have been extra features.  Or maybe, include the original cut as a bonus.  Also, what's up with those 3rd rate computer graphics? Did the director do those at home? It's great to finally get this on DVD, but it's not what we've all been waiting for.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I am from a family of artists; my mother, who was Welsh, was a professional pianist. My father was a professional drummer. An uncle was a professional artist. (Another uncle raised horses.) So from an early age, the arts and horses and ballet and figure skating were all included in my life.<BR>So I can say, from experence, that &quot;The Pianist&quot; is fantastic!! Anyone who loves music of any-kind; this DVD is wonderful.
B00008PW2D|1.0|The producers of Sex And The City seem to have gotten it back together for Season 5 after a whiny Season 3 and a quirky Season 4. As a fan, though, I am sorely disappointed that a half-season has been priced so high. I'm expecting Season 6, when it does appear, to accommodate the loss that this release will incur, so their combined prices will complete the insult to collectors worldwide. No thanks, I'm waiting for the next season. And if you're reading, HBO, please do include real special features in your next release -- like the farewell episodes of the series and perhaps a guide to the gals' wardrobe.
B000089RVR|4.0|I have never bought a Dido album, ever. I liked all of her singles off &quot;No Angel&quot; and I thought &quot;White Flag&quot; Was OK, but I really loved the song &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, and the other day (well yesterday!) I was looking around and saw 3 Dido &quot;Life For Rent&quot; Album Casettes there for $6.99, I thought It's cheap, my friend says its good, might as well buy it. I never had an intention to buy this EVER!, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the up-beat songs and beautiful lyrics. I never knew she was sooooo out there such as the songs &quot;Stoned&quot;, with the odd lyics &quot;When your'e stoned baby/ And I am drunk/ And we make love/ It seems a little desolate/&quot; RRRRigght! and the lyics for a song I cannot remember &quot;I dont touch you the way I used to/&quot; OK , but none the less, I love this album and would reccomend it to anyone who is thinking of purchasing it!
0780622553|5.0|Well, where do I start...? The drop-down menu asked me how I rate the DVD... and the truth is that THE DVD SUCKS!!!! Don't get me wrong now, the movie is amazing, and I wholly agree with Roger Ebert when he says that this is one of the few original sci-fi movies of the past 2-3 decades. However, as may be inferred from the title, it is also a very dark movie - and I don't mean the storyline or the action. So what does New Line Cinema do with it? Ah! they make it even darker in the transfer, so that most of the scenes consist of a disembodied face or faces floating on a uniformly BLACK background! Thanks! <br />Also thanks for the idiotic cardboard case! I simply refuse to believe that it is easier or cheaper to make them than the standard-issue plastic cases; the only difference is that cardboard _feels_ cheap, and is easily ruined so that in 3-5 months of use you end up with a spongy piece of junk, which has GOT to be the reason why they decided to package this brilliant movie that way!<br />Way to treat your &quot;Platinum Series&quot;, New Line Cinema. I'm waiting for the Special Edition, where you may consider packaging the disc in a paper sleeve and throw in a few bugs and transfer artifacts.<br />P.S. And would anyone care to enlighten me as to why is it a double-sided DVD with ALL THE SAME THINGS on each side?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best new shows to come out since Buffy the Vampire Slayer...watch for the major motion picture Serenity in 2005!!!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|It has been thirty years since \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level.  I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricisim as his marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of 1974.  I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in his greatest songs of the Sixties.<br /><br />In \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" Dylan also turned his back on his greatest backing band, returning to his artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based.  The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and pain.  At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's \\"America's Sweetheart\\").  After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:<br /><br />\\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is the best song on the album and the ambguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances.  The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favorite Dylan cover.<br /><br />\\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album.  The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.<br /><br />\\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" is a ballad on the end of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters.  You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Wind\\" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the pair being a set of put-down songs.  The difference is that while both song lash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain \\"babe.\\"  This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.<br /><br />\\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.<br /><br />\\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palatte for what was coming next on the album.<br /><br />\\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a 8:50 story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album.  It also has a line that Dylan seems to sing with nice pitch and without affection, to wit, \\"and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\\"  Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.<br /><br />\\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the end of the relationship, turning his anger in on himself.<br /><br />\\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss.  The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to end on an optimstic note.<br /><br />\\"Buckets of Rain\\" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds.  After this song there is no where left to go.<br /><br />\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is listed by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine as the #16 record on the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, between #15 \\"Are You Experienced?\\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #17 \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana.

B00009V7RF|4.0|B.E.P's first MAJOR album is OK, The songs are cool and I love repeating the songs I love, These are some Key songs for you to look out for!:<br />Lets Get Retarded (LOL! I love this one!)<br />Hey Mama (The truth is I dont like the version on this but the TV version is perfect!)<br />Shut Up (Who could not love this!?!)<br />Latin Girls (Cool!)<br />Where Is The Love? (I am very sick of this song but Its an instant classic!)<br />Well, yeah thats it, if you just love &quot;Where is the love?&quot; and &quot;SHUT UP&quot; I really reccomend you listen to the whole thing in some way before you buy this, cuz I think most people arent gonna like what they think they are gonna hear!, this whole album IS NOT like those 2 songs. I liked this, but it wasnt what I expected. You have been warned.
0385512104|5.0|It's very difficult to understand the extremely hard work that went into writing this book. To get into the mind of an autistic person, and then to construct a credible narrative must have been unreal! Once that was done, to make a plot that held the reader's interest from beginning to end, and then to keep the narrative within the &quot;voice&quot; of the main character was truly awesome. This is truly &quot;a heartbreaking work of staggering genius&quot;. and should be required reading in schools, particularly writers schools. Budding authors could learn a lot from this book, and readers everywhere would be grateful.
0345440900|5.0|This is a very helpful book for someone who has never been around babies and doesn't have a clue.  It certainly helped my family and our colicky baby.  I wonder if some of the people reviewing this book have actually read it?  She is not pro-formula, but encourages women to make the best choice for their family (and encourages women to try not to feel guilty about their choice--I am very pro-breastfeeding, but women do deserve a choice and shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it!) and I like the fact that she introduces the concept that you can do both, something you don't hear anywhere else.  <br />A good book is still a book, a guide, to help you make decisions about caring for your child.  If something in it isn't working for you and your child, then you have to keep doing research, keep consulting your pediatrician, keep at it until you find what works.  If your child is failing to thrive, then good grief, feed it more often.  You can't blame that on this author.  Her technique of feeding on one breast at a feeding is sound advice because the child gets more hindmilk that way, any lactation nurse who knows her stuff will tell you that.  But if your child is still hungry or isn't gaining weight, then, you know you will have to feed her more!<br />This is the only book I read that actually helps you figure out through body language (an infant's only language) what your baby needs.  Before I read this book I had no idea when my baby was hungry or tired or overtired.  I couldn't get him to sleep.  All I saw was a fussy, crying baby.  Once I knew what to look for it all seemed so clear!  It helped me give my son what he needed and made him happier within days.  Was life idyllic and perfect, no, I am still learning and reading and trying to be a better mom every day!<br />My only complaint about this book was that it wasn't longer and that there wasn't more detail about how to modify the techniques as your child grows.  It is more of a rescue book, to help people who are clueless, like I was, figure out what their baby needs and help the WHOLE FAMILY get more rest and sleep.  Something you really need to be able to be the best mommy possible.  I wouldn't call this a baby trainer.  She is a child advocate not someone who tells you to let a baby cry it out--just the opposite!<br />It helped us, anyway!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater the week before the Oscars and was very offended. I thought I was the only one that didn't like the way the Japanese people were represented. It was very stereotypical, not funny, and lacked imagination. Borderline racist might be putting it nicely. It was horrible.<br />After seeing &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; where the Japanese people/culture were treated with such respect and dignity, \\"Lost in Translation\\" was a complete disaster. But Hollywood loves good racism. She never should have been nominated for this movie. The screenplay was awful. She just made fun of Japanese people throughout the entire movie. How is that Oscar worthy???<br />The academy should be embarrassed that they nominated \\"The Triplets of Belleville\\" and \\"Lost in Translation.\\" It's a tie between which one was actually more egregious. I've never written a bad review for anything on Amazon.com, but I was genuinely offended by this movie. I didn't like how the Japanese were portrayed.
6305291446|4.0|It took almost 20 years for Jamie Lee Curtis to return to the role that made her famous, but it was worth the wait. \\"Halloween: H20\\" is a great suspense film but doesn't have the psyhcological grip that the original has.<br />For Laurie Strode, life has been a rough road since 10/31/78. The head mistress of a private school in California and the mother of a teenage son, Laurie drinks her life away as a closet alcoholic trying to forget that awful Halloween night of long ago. She better get a grip though, because the past is about to rear its ugly head in the form of Michael Myers, who wants to meet his nephew, and get a little payback.<br />Steve Miner, who directed and created the \\"Friday the 13th\\" films, directs \\"H20\\" after John Carpenter declined (he once said \\"How can you make a sequel to a film that doesn't need one?\\"). The cast is great and is one of the best slasher casts I've seen since \\"Scream\\" (especially, Janet Leigh who stars as Curtis' secretary in the film, complete with the style car she drove in \\"Psycho\\"). Josh Hartnett makes his film debut here as Michael's nephew and Michelle Williams plays his girlfriend.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|What is wrong with this movie is that it desperately wants to be profound, but it feels like Sofia Coppola wrote herself into the corner and didn't know how to solve it.  In the end, it seems, she was unable to solve it even for herself, so she leaves the ending an enigma, and not even an engaging one.  There was no climax to this movie, and there was next to no plot.  Certainly a movie could still be a great picture without either of these things, but to do so it must convey SOMETHING to make you feel better for having watched it, and Lost In Translation failed at that.<br />The little plot this film did have was disjointed, which, while adding to the overall feeling of confusion, left me feeling a disconnect with the characters and their circumstances, It jumped around without any regard for scene continuity.  This did not create the feeling of being \\"lost\\" so much as it created a feeling of a lack of direction and attention to detail:  The \\"friends\\" Charlotte knew in Japan she never spoke to or appeared to know, and she of course abandoned them without thought, the two characters connection that jumps to familiarity with hardly a conversation, Charlotte asking Bill Murray's character he can come out with her that evening without telling him her name, room number, what time, or where they should meet, and then the sudden appearance of Bob in her hotel room making himself at home.  Because of scene discontinuity and flat dialogue, the characters feel one-dimensional and do not inspire me to feel any connection with them, even though I have felt the emotions they seemed to be struggling with many times.   There are a lot of moments in the film that almost allow this connection, but they are too few and far between to get any real sense of the people involved, and we see the main characters much in the same way that they seem to see Tokyo: far removed and unrelating.<br />Part of the characters' one-dimensionality seems to come from Sofia Coppola's heavy-handed version of \\"subtlety.\\"  An example is the obvious comparison between the way Charlotte's husband reacts when the pretty blonde approaches him, and the way Bob Harris  reacts in almost the identical setup.  If the movie's plan is to be a subtle portrait, which I can only assume is the purpose, then I would prefer it not to hand feed me such details, but let me discover them for myself.  This kind of writing seems to have come directly out of some beginning screenwriter's handbook, not from the hand of a genius.<br />Overall, the movie manages to express the feeling that you get when you're stranded in a foreign place, but it failed to take that feeling anywhere.  Yes, there is some wonder, some oddity and confusion, some loneliness and introversion, an assessment of your life especially compared to what's going on around you, and an amplification of your own thoughts because you're isolated.  But what of that?  What is the insight, the revelation?  What makes this movie important or worth wasting 2 hours for?  We've all felt that, we all know it.  Going there with a couple of uncharismatic characters was not worth my time or my ten bucks.  It's like taking a 35mm picture of a strange couple in front of a sunset.  In the first place I don't know the couple so I don't really care to have their picture, and in the second place, the 35mm picture couldn't capture what the sunset was really like, especially if I've seen it first hand.  You need to give me something more, and Sofia Coppola didn't in this film.
B0000E5PEE|5.0|As cliched as it might sound, there are no words to describe either the talent of Dulce Pontes or the quality of this recording. This is one breathtaking singer, approximating the status of divinity on &quot;FOCUS&quot;. For those lucky enough to understand the Portuguese lyrics, what a blessing; you may as well have discovered a new planet, a new world, particularly with regards to &quot;Renascer&quot; and &quot;Voo&quot;. The inclusion of songs in English and Italian is a bonus.Dulce is so much more than a singer on this disc - she is life itself, in all its magical strains, in all its tortuous twists. Listen to &quot;No Ano Que Vem&quot; and you'll know what I'm talking about. No wonder that the album has done so brilliantly in Portugal and is now infiltrating countries such as Greece, Spain, Italy and Japan. Focus is a universal event, a celebration of that exquisite beauty which for so many of us remains a mere longing. Along Dulce's short career, this is the moment we've all waited for - now the world needs to discover it also. When I first heard this masterpiece, I felt that I was transcending, re-emerging, beginning to live all over again. Inevitably, Ennio Morricone must be mentioned - a great genius! The passion of his compositions remains unequalled - &quot;A Rose Among Thorns&quot; is testimony to the brilliance of both composer and singer. Through Dulce's miraculous imterpretation, Ennio Morricone's music must perforce become the new standard. I have been listening to the album for three days... and I feel like buying it again! Bravo, to two magical human beings perfectly poised on the wings of a wonder!
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball tells the story of Billy Beane and his radically different (and effective) understanding of baseball as a matter of statistics.  The success of the Oakland A's, despite one of baseball's lowest payrolls, attests to the efficacy of the strategy.  This book is about much more than Beane or baseball; it describes the uphill battle that truth fights against the safety of conventional wisdom.  You do not need to know the difference between a fastball and a fly ball in order to enjoy this book, or find its message relevant.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Her second album \\"Stripped\\" is a huge success. Her great talent and amazing vocal skills makes this one of the best CD's. Now that the genie is out of her bottle and stripped, She's amazing.<BR>My favorite songs on this album are: Can't Hold Us Down, Infatuation, Underappreciated, Beautiful, Soar, Get Mine, Get Yours, Dirrty, and Keep on Singin' My Song.<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down - A well balanced song. The beat is catchy. The lyrics can relate to a lot of us women out there. This is truly one of the best songs on the album. A-<br />3. Walk Away - Not something I enjoy very much. But it is still a work of art. With her vocal skills to the highest it is a good song. B+<br />4. Fighter - This song definatley stands out from the other songs. With it's great rock beat it's another one of the best songs on the album. A-<br />6. Infatuation - This song is breath taking. The latin style with her great vocals this is a great touch to the album. A+<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me - One of the lower quality songs. It's not bad but not one of my favorites. B-<br />9. Impossibe - This song is very relaxing. It's smooth beat and her amazing talents it's clearly a great song. Though it's not one of her best. B+<br />10. Underappreciated - I love this song. A song that makes you wanna sing along. A-<br />11. Beautiful - A great song. Her vocal performance is to the top. The words are touching. And is an inspiring song. A+<br />12. Make Over - A great song. Though, it does get tiring after a while. But it is still a great song with a good beat. B+<br />13. Cruz - I love this song. It's very calming. And makes the CD a great one. A-<br />14. Soar - Another one of my favorites. A great success for Christina! A-<br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours - Then again, one of my favorites. This song has a good beat and the song fits together like a puzzle. A+<br />16. Dirrty - This is one of her few fast, tight, beat songs. I love this song. This was her first single. And it hit #1 in the UK. A+<br />18. The Voice Within - This is another one of her inspiring songs. I think this is her best vocal performance on the CD. A-<br />19. I'm OK - This song is a bit depressing. It makes you wonder and feel heart broken. But It is a great song B-<br />20. Keep On Sigin' My Song - My FAVORITE song on the album. This song is a great song. It's words and beat are hot. A+
B00015HVI8|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  I love Star Trek, and it used to be my number one show.  Stargate is far better than any Star Trek.  I love the dark humor they display at times.  I could go on talking about the show.  Please see for yourself.
B00005R23X|1.0|This film,although true to the stoker novel, was extremely boring and morbid. It was truly sickening when Dracula hands his female concubines an infant that they devour alive. Was this scene truly needed? It made me sick! Other scenes that seemed closer to softcore porn was when Keanu is in bed with draculas concubines ... truly not needed and disgusting.
B0000UJL96|3.0|Many others have written about the Film and extras itself so I will leave that to them.<br />Paramount really dropped the ball on this one. The DVD are arranged in such a way that at least one of them could very easily get scratched. On top of that for whatever reason they decided not to includea booklet like they did with all the other Star Trek Special Edition series.<br />I am really disapointed with Paramount over this. I am very lucky my copy did not arive damaged.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I just saw Daredevil on cable and it's pretty good. Not awful at all. The reviews on here are a great deal of fun to read. I love how some feel that Daredevil is unbelievable, but the Hulk makes sense! I enjoyed the Hulk movie, but it's as ridiculous as Daredevil. I also love how Daredevil get's slammed for casting an African American as a bad guy. Hate to break it to you, but there are black criminals. Don't take the nitpicking too seriously if you haven't seen this movie. You won't have to be a comic nerd to enjoy this flick. This is an entertaining escapist movie for those who can lighten up and enjoy it.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Before, I've always admired Christina for being sexy but not overly slutty. Those days are over now. She has matured and tried so many things to get recognized and be as successful as the other dirty dancer Britney, but to no avail. Sad to say, a lot of people are being disgusted with her image. The only saving grace in this album is \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\". And don't mind the rest! One star goes for the outstanding and powerful voice and that's about it! To me, she is not sexy at all!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah has not disappointed me...this album's simply breathtaking and amazing!The best tracks are Fallen,Train wreck,World on Fire and drifting!Her songs are inspirational,they can give u much strength when you're down and the lyrics are also beautiful.Everyone should listen to this album and be awed by her music!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The entire theater audience groaned at the end. One man even asked if there was anyone in the theater who enjoyed it. There wasn't.<BR>I finally understood the great reviews when I read the credits.<BR>Sophia Coppola, director...being the daughter of the famed Francis Ford Coppola can get you some great reviews, and even an Oscar, even when the movie is bland and boring.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|I really liked the movie so I picked up the soundtrack on a lark.  Well it didn't really sound that great by itself.  I wish I had listened to some samples first.  You may want to try that before you buy.  I don't think it's for everyone.
B000099T2L|2.0|Sure! Ms. Knowles is tall, beautiful and sexy but to think of it... there are other singers as well who is much taller, more seductive and effortlessly talented than her. Songs like \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" can be easily forgotten as a lot of songs with similar flavors are being thrown away in the bin these days. Knowles has to do something with her songs or do something shocking and different before she is totally forgotten. The album is fairly good for a solo debut, and that is to be respected and be given credit as well.
0688145078|5.0|this book is one of the favorite stories of our 18-month-old, so much so that we're able to quote the story during regular conversations during the day.  we have yet to find out how well this book does for preparing our son for his little brother, but at least he knows that there are some things that big kids can do that babies cannot.  i like the fact that the book emphasizes that a big brother can be very helpful with the new baby and is still very loved by his parents.
0446677450|5.0|I bought the ebook version of Rich Dad Poor Dad to put in my Pocket PC... I'm a medical intern and we are required to go to these very boring lectures for 1-2 hours each day.  So I bought the book thinking that since I have to go to these lectures at least I can read something semi-interesting during these o/w sleep-inducing sessions.  This book is AWESOME.  So much so that I now actually look forward to going to the lectures just so I can read Rich Dad Poor Dad!<br />I feel like the author is talking to me... his views on life &amp; money are thoughts that I've had all me life... but ones that most of society frown upon (or are actually afraid of).  I'm training to be a radiologist -- a profession that typically pays anywhere from 300K - 1 mill annually -- but I've never felt entirely content with that... this book is opening my eyes and my mind as to why -- b/c I don't want to be part of the &quot;Rat Race&quot; that most others are.<br />If you're the type that, regardless of what your salary may be, are not satisfied with the daily grind of a 9-5, Monday-Friday, dinner &amp; movies on weekends, and 3 weeks vacation-a-year life, then this book is for you.<br />Thanks Mr. Kiyosaki!
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a wonderful book about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who is murdered by a complete stranger.  The murder comes as an absolute shock in 1973 to her family, friends and neighbors that surround her in the quiet neighborhood that she lives in. Once you start reading this book it is extremely hard to put it down. The suspense that is involved is amazing. <BR>After Susie is killed she is placed in a division of heaven for people that are not ready to let go of the friends and family that they loved on earth. The heaven is also for people that are having a hard time coming to the realization that they will no longer be able to walk on earth. Here they can watch over everyone that they cared for. They are also able to watch them as they change grow and become older. <BR>As Susie watches from above she comes to realize how hard it is to cope with someone's death. Her death effects people whom she didn't even realize cared. Watching over everyone is more difficult then Susie thought. There are so many times that she just wants to reach out and help and comfort them but yet she can't. Susie also becomes frustrated because the police force can't even find her murder because the evidence so well hidden. <BR>Throughout the book there are so many exciting moments tear jerking moments and moments that will make the reader think of their own life. The story line is touching. The author uses such descriptive language that puts such vivid pictures in your mind that it makes the book stand out from any other book you will ever read.
B00005Y228|3.0|This review is kinda late but I thought I'd write one for Kylie. Not really a big follower of this Aussie wench, but on the other hand, I owned this album not too long ago, and I say that it's good for a diva who doesn't know how to sing and I'm serious. The tunes are meant for tripping singer and it well suited her style and voice. No offense meant but Dannii (although not a great singer as well) is miles away when it comes to singing. &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, &quot;Come Into My World&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; are the best tracks off the album. Great forgettable disco dishes! Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston would laugh, Tina Arena would knod her head. Cheers!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|There are three essential items you should have in order to fully enjoy this movie to the max:<br />1) A big screen TV, preferably widescreen;<BR>2) A powerful surround-sound stereo system; and,<BR>3) A love for horror/action flicks with a desire to sit back and <BR>   just relax for a couple of hours.<br />Have these three things, and you will absolutely love this movie. The action scenes are quite intense, and the special effects are really something to behold. Now, when I watched this movie I lacked two of the basic elements to watch this movie properly (I don't have a big, widescreen TV, or a surround sound stereo system) so I know I could not have fully enjoyed this film, because a lot of what went into this film was its effects. Yet, I was hooked by the surprisingly interesting plot to this movie. The concept of mixing vampires and werewolves is one I have never come across before I watched this, so this intrigued me. However, I did not find a whole lot of substance to this movie besides this. The visual and sound effects are still quite good even on a normal TV (like what most of us have), and so I still enjoyed it in other ways.<br />Overall, I recommend this movie for action/special effects enthusiasts. Also, I recommend this movie if you do not like Lost in Translation (I did a review on that, also), it is a huge change of pace from that movie and it will keep you entertained in a way that most people can enjoy.
B000002GJH|4.0|Anyone who is even slightly interested in Pearl Jam or Soundgraden should check out this CD. Although it is mainly Chris Cornell (lead vocals for Soundgarden), Eddie Vedder makes a great appearance in Hunger Strike (a video & radio staple to this day, despite being produced over a dozen years ago).<br /> The most memorable tracks include &quot;Say Hello To Heaven&quot; & &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, but that may just be because they were the tracks released as singles. However, this is not the case of an album fueled by one or two hit singles. This entire album reflects the deep talent range posessed by all members of the group.<br /> Sadly, Temple of the Dog would be a one-shot album, as Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Mike McCready, and Eddie Vedder would go on to form Pearl Jam, while Chris Cornell and drummer Matt Cameron would move on to form Soundgarden. However, don't let that discourage you from getting this album, or any of Soundgarden's or Pearl Jam's albums. While Soundgarden may be no more, Pearl Jam is alive and well, and with roughly 3 years between albums, that's plenty of time to familiarize yourself with their sound and pick up all their other albums.<br /> For Pearl Jam, their debut, &quot;Ten&quot;, is especially powerful, and for Soundgarden, check out &quot;Superunknown&quot;.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|Scarface, done by mr. De Palma. Al Pacino stars in this classic movie of coming out on top in the drug world. Tony Montana (pacino) arrives in amercia trying to make it big, and in the 70's there is only one way to get to the top and fast. Overall the film is well done for the technology at the time. The subtle yet emotional movements of the camera as well as the depressing ans somewhat eery music creates a good atmosphere and gives added feeling to the characters. The acting was weel played off and i was even led to believe that these people werw who they were acting. All in all this was a good film and i do recomend people go to rent this for them selves. I hope many people down the line in years can enjoy and appreciate a classic like this one.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney... uhmmm, I really don't like her, literally. I gave her 2 stars, one for her fabulous videos and one for the song &quot;Toxic&quot;. The song is cheesy but you'll get hooked to it so that's a big plus! She can't sing obviously. The problem is that she is always on air 24/7 so you'll get bored and tired no matter how much she shifts her image. Britney Spears fans, no pun intended but Tina Arena can sing far better than her with cotton wools stuffed in her mouth... Don't buy this album!
6304981635|5.0|ENTER THE DRAGON is considered the greatest kung fu film ever made. It is. BUT, I think it's better than that. This is the BEST movie ever. BRUCE LEE is without doubt the greatest martial artist of all time. He can completely dominate anyone. The only reason he's dead is because he worked so hard in his life to atain the highest level of performance ever seen by a fighter and he achieved that goal. Bruce died on July 20th 1973, three weeks before ENTER THE DRAGON was released. The movie sees Lee take revenge for the murder of his sister by entering a martial arts tournament organized by drug lord HAN (Shih Kien). Lee takes on Han in the final battle which will leave you mesmorized forever.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The soundtrack- which I had listened to before viewing the movie,  moved me to tears and rejoicing! The music is gorgeous, along with mysterious and even terrifying in some parts!<BR> A true Tour de Force!<BR> I give it 5 stars because I have always enjoyed Middle-Eastern <BR>music, and I have always enjoyed music that can tell a story and move you to a different plane, so to speak, musically.<BR> The movie is also incredibly powerful and deserves 5 stars for great and daring story telling in the face of opposition. I am a Christian and pray that this movie will bring many to Christ and that they will accept His awesome sacrifice for our sins!
B0000000LI|5.0|With each of the orchestral instruments individually mic'd, it is no surprise that this cd delivers a rich and satisfying sound. Reflections of Passion is beautiful as always and One Man's Dream doesn't fall short of a simple masterpiece. Not everyone will love this album, but if you like instrumental music, you won't be disappointed. If you do enjoy Yanni, also check out a new artist by the name of Josh Kramer. His album is called &quot;Stepping Out&quot;. It is almost like a combination of Jim Brickman (with added talent) and Yanni, with flares of Danny Elfman and Rachmaninoff here and there. I found it here on Amazon.com
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'd like to thank those gaijin who choose to point out that we should be so offended by racism in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; but I really think there is so much real racism in this world you would be better off complaining about. <br />How many of you who say this is racist have ever even seen a Japanese film? Expecially a comedy. Many of this things this film laughs at are things we laugh at ourselves. Have you seen Oshima's satires of Japanese behaviour? Have you seen how much Juzo Itami laughs at aspects of our behaviour in &quot;The Funeral&quot;, Tampopo&quot;, &quot;Taxing Woman&quot;? I am sure you haven't seen Takashi Mike's &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; if you think this director is over-critical of Japanese. You probably shouldn't ever see a Japanese comedy. Have you seen &quot;Battlefield Royale&quot; which makes fun of Japanese militarism in a very cruel way - a much more powerful criticism than anything Coppola gives? I don't think so. <br />And anyway, all this is a smoke screen. The truth is the film is too subtle for some people. They are angry that a film like this is even made. And they just use racism as an excuse. The film makes fun of the American photographer too, who is just SO impressed by famous women. It makes fun of the famous woman who looks like Cameron Diaz. It makes fun of a foreign lounge singer in Japan. It makes fun of a man who sleeps with one woman even when he has real feelings for another and is married to even another. Some people see this and are very righteous about it, and others claim not to see it because they only care about racism on Japanese. Not every Japanese loves karaoke. Some of us think it is funny and bad. Are we racist for thinking so?<br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a film about Western meeting Eastern. There will always be misunderstandings. Pretending there are no cultural differences and such misunderstandings never happen would be the real racism.<br />In the end this is a gentle love film. Complaining about it being racist is like complaining Finding Nemo is cruel to fish.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Words cannot express how great this film is. A must see for all musicians &amp; for anyone who enjoyed George Harrison's music. Eric Clapton is in the best form I've ever seen. Check out Gary Brooker singing 'Old Brown Shoe'-----priceless.
B0001AP158|5.0|Great intimate, acoustic performance of the songs their latest CD, including some songs not on the album.  Also includes two great new songs, Last Man Standing and Thief of Hearts, and a excellent cover of Dr. Hook's &quot;Sylvia's Mother.  Whether Bon Jovi is rockin' out electrically or crooning acoustically, always a show to see.
B00015HVI8|5.0|Well, you've come to the right place. I was never a sci-fi fan until I started watching this show. To date, this has been the only show to have me laughing, crying, and sitting on the edge of my seat all in one episode. My favorite thing about this show is the dynamics of the characters. When one member of the team is in trouble, the rest are there to help at any cost. In &quot;Abyss&quot;, Daniel Jackson returns to his friend's (Colonel O'neill)aid as he is being tortured. Back on Earth, the rest of the team desperatly tries to figure a way to get their firend home. This is just one example of the many great episodes you will find in this season. This is an exceptional show. I really hope you can enjoy it as much as I have.

B00007KWHN|4.0|I appreciate the background information and statements of adoration about this early album by Yes. But you reviewers should remember that most of your readers are already Yes fanatics who may already own an earlier version of this album and they want to know way more about the bonus tracks other than that they're included here. Tell about the single versions. Are they edited by monkeys? Or just a section removed to be a single (like &quot;Your Move&quot;)? Tell about the tracking sessions (different lyrics?).<br />We all know the band Yes is good and that The Yes Album is a classic in the Yes catalog, but I need to know more about what's different about THIS release from the other &quot;remasterings&quot; of The Yes Album. Please tell me some substance about THIS release!
0790731452|5.0|This film is a real gem! The aliens are so cute and love the way talk. Martian Spy Girl is the best and some wickedly fun cameos from Tom Jones, Pam Grier, Martin Short and Glenn Close as a pseudo-Nancy Reagan clone.
B0001CCXGG|3.0|I was at the Denver show so I kind of new what to expect from this CD. <br />I'd start by saying there is some great shredding on this CD. By adding Yngwie, this is really the most extreme G3 in my opinion. If you like hard-core, balls to the wall jamming then you'll love the G3 Jam because they tear it up. The whole CD has a lot of raw energy and really sounds like a concert, not something mixed to the hilt in the studio. Unfortunately I happen to prefer the tasteful jamming of Eric Johnson and I liked the first G3 better. <br />I think Joe's songs come off best on this CD. He has a more-raw sound than usual which some attribute to his new Peavey amps. He plays a few songs that you hear on other live albums. I wish he would have put Starry Night from his last album on here.<br />Out of Steve's songs I like Reaping a lot. At the concert everybody was really into it a lot. I wish he would have included another song. The first song, doesn't do much for me.<br />Yngwie picked the wierdest combination of songs to play for his set. Blitzkrieg and Trilogy Suite are cool. What about putting Evil Eye instead of that stupid Fugue that sounds like a bad incarnation of something from the Classical period (Freddy vs. Bach). Also, the Hendrix guitar smashing jam was cool when Jimi did it, but come on, its 2003 man. <br />All in all if you like these guys its probably worth picking up.
006054094X|1.0|Menzies' spins his tale by a series of speculations built on conjectures resting on possibilities and underlain by wild guesses - and he then pronounces the result a certainty. Eric von Danekin showed more scholarship in making his claim that aliens built the pyramids. Immanuel Velikovski's Worlds in Collision was a masterpiece. Pseudo-science and pseudo-history are going downhill.
B000002LMK|5.0|This is Neil Young and Crazy Horse in their finest hour.  From the very first chords of Country Home, the Horse grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.  Passion and intensity abound as the music triumphs over all else.
B00008H2LB|4.0|First of all, i had gotten a mixed cd from my cousin. It had many rock bands like Offspring, Deftones, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, Papa Roach, and last but not least Linkin Park. The first time i had listened to this cd all the way through, two songs stood out from the whole cd. Guess who made those songs? Yeah, Linkin Park did. I thanked my cousin later for the cd because if she hadnt given it to me, i would have never been experienced to the new sound of Linkin Park. Great band!
0156027321|5.0|What a beautiful tale of a man so full of God he needed three religions to encompass his faith. I was so enthralled by his culture and tale, then completely moved by the metaphor of his struggle. If I could have an endless book that told this man's story, I would read it over and over again.
B00012QM9K|4.0|Shindlers List is another fine example of the genius works of Steven Spielberg. Those who are unfamiliar with World War II  and the atrocities that Germany committed will glean much from this film. There are many graphic moments yet it maintains a level of taste in respect of those who suffered tremendously in which this film is dedicated to. <br />Anti-Semitism is sadly rising again in Europe and hopefully this film will remind those who preach (and webpost) hate what it ultimately generates.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I purchased this DVD with very little knowledge about this movie.  What I discovered was one of the best movies of 2003.  Keisha Castle-Hughes' performance carries this movie and was deserving of much more than an Oscar nomination.  <BR>This movie is suitable for viewers of all ages.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After seeing the musical I can honestly say that it will forever change your mind about the Wizard of Oz.  Both Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth performed wonderfully and I would expect to see Ms. Menzel win a Tony Award for her performance.  The show as well as the CD keeps you wanting for more and I always find myself singing, whistling or humming one song or the other.  The first act ended with Defying Gravity and I can say that I literally jumped out of my seat.  Enjoy this CD and if you can get to the show it is a must see.
0381980553|4.0|&quot;The Three Daughters of Madame Liang&quot; was Pearl S. Buck's last major novel and it holds its own with the best of her work.  In Madame Liang, Buck has created a fascinating character, a woman who is very much her own person.  After doing the very un-Chinese thing of leaving her husband when he takes a concubine, which he claims is his right because his wife has produced no son, Madame Liang determines to make her own way in the world and opens a gourmet restaurant that caters to the high and mighty of the People's Republic (even good Communists appreciate good food).  She has not only survived, but thrived, by keeping a low profile and providing her customers with the best.  But she has sent her three daughters, Grace, Mercy and Joy, to America to be educated; and now, after many years separation, Grace has been called home by her government to serve the new society.<br />Madame Liang has her own opinions about the new society which she has prudently kept to herself.  But Grace, back home in China, throws herself into her work as a doctor and embraces everything blindly, including a young physician named Liu Pang, who parrots everything he has read in Mao's Little Red Book.  Mercy, the second sister, is a musician, whose talents are not in demand in the People's Republic; but she misses her home and induces her new husband, a rocket scientist, to return to their country.  For Grace, the return home is the fulfillment of herself; for Mercy and her husband, it is a disaster.  Meanwhile, the third sister, Joy, a painter, having found romance and happiness with a fellow artist who has left China for good and never intends to return, remains in America to make her life with him.<br />Madame Liang watches the growing tension and hostility dividing the two older sisters with alarm and resignation.  She can't live her daughters' lives for them; all she can do is keep on living her own life.  But her own life can't survive the insanity of the Cultural Revolution; the very success of her restaurant means she's an enemy of the working classes.  The Cultural Revolution sweeps everything away in its path; including Madame Liang.<br />Buck writes with a flow that keeps her book moving effortlessly along like an unbroken skein of thread (one gets thoroughly caught up in the narrative before realizing that there are no chapters; the book moves from one scene to the next till the final page), covering some six or seven years from the end of the 50's to 1966.  Through it all, Madame Liang's continually expressed faith in her country and people suggest that, whatever her own fate, China and its people will survive in spite of themselves.  Although the book is ostensibly about her three daughters, it's really the story of a remarkable woman, and through her, the story of China in transition.; the very success of her restaurant means she's an enemy of the working classes.

0553579908|5.0|All I can say after reading the second book was &quot;WOW!&quot;. The first one was fast-paced and entertaining. But the second really made me emotionally stirred. I felt more for the characters (My favorites being Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow). Some parts made me mad, others made me happy, and the end made me cry tears of joy. This is not like any other still written fantasy series. I felt like I had to continue reading this to see what happened to characters who seem like real thinking people and not cutouts of typical fantasy characters. What Tolkien did with world-building, Martin does with his characters. I can't wait to start the third book!
0385504209|5.0|The success of this book is evident in all the phony reviews placed here by extremist fundamental christers who probably haven't read the book at all.  I just read an article about extreme fundamentalists being encouraged to leave negative reviews about works thier church leadership deemed worthy of censorship.  They fill their reviews with the same dribble near word for word found in their extremist political spam and radio shows.  For example: &quot;I've never written a negative review on Amazon before, but I felt I had to alert readers to, as it were, &quot;the facts of the case.&quot;&quot;  That sounds like a 10 year old faking a letter to Penthouse magazine.  And, &quot;The basis of his claims come from second rate New Agey conspiracy theorists and Crunchy Granola Goddess Worshippers.&quot;  Do good readers really speak that way?  Not likely.  I've noticed a great many books on Amazon suffer from these bogus reviews that all seem like they are written by the same person.  Or more likely, written by many people who all listen to the same lemming hour radio show.<br />It's a good fun read and the research is great.  If only 90% of this is true (proveable) it's a great investment of your time.  Still, reading won't unravel your world or bring the end of life as we know it.  But you might feel a lot more aware of our world and how it got this way.<br />Good luck!
B00000JCOV|2.0|but it just gets kind of old, this album has a few gems, and the rest is just screaming and pure noise. the best songs are the ones where there is actual singing in it, it provides a good mix and a change of pace.<BR>   &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; is by far the best song on the album and i never seem to get tired of it. &quot;Surfacing&quot; is also pretty good along with &quot;Spit it out&quot; and &quot;Me inside&quot;(Although a little too short.<BR>  The rest of the album is just a bunch of incomprehensible screaming, deafening guitars, a couple of clowns(literally) hitting trash cans and a drummer thats so good he really seems out of his element.
6304698623|5.0|Warner Brothers' &quot;A Little Princess&quot; followed the critical success of their previous adaptation of Frances Hodgeson Burnett's classic story &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, which despite being one of the best children's movies recently created had a reasonably quiet (though by no means unsuccessful) run at the box-office. Sadly it seemed that children needed explosions and action and strobe lights and goodness knows what else in order to justify their time at the movies. But this didn't stop Warner Brothers' from creating &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and I for one am glad they did. Wonderful casting, beautiful visuals and a tearful ending make this a family classic.<br />Sara Crewe is the daughter of an adoring father; Captain Crewe, a high-ranking army officer stationed in exotic India. Raised under the belief that she and every other woman in the world is naturally a princess, she knows of no hardships in her life. But the year is 1914, and war is on the horizon. With her father called away to fight, Sara is taken to a New York boarding school for girls under the control of the stately Miss Minchin. It is with this matriarch that Sara goes head-to-head with, as their philosophies on life are so utterly opposite. Harbouring resentment and jealously toward the little princess, it is as much cruelty as it is kindess when Miss Minchin employs Sara as a servant girl after news of her father's death.<br />Suddenly Sara has gone from the girl who has everything to the girl who has nothing. Her faith in magic and storytelling shattered, she refuses to acknowledge the good she has already done in befriending several classmates, and it is up to the very real presence of magic in her life to intervene: watch how one &quot;coincidental&quot; gust of wind blows her shawl into the feet of someone who can change her fortunes once more, setting off a chain reaction that just might lead her once more to her father...<br />Liesel Matthews begins her debut as Sara Crewe, and creates her wonderfully - youthful innocence and wisdom beyond her years combine to create this wonderful character who brings joy to the life of so many, from the distraught Lottie to the servant girl Becky, with whom all contact is strictly forbidden. Her fall from grace to her gradual renewal of faith is just beautiful to watch in a performance not matched until Rachel Hurd-Wood played Wendy in 2003's &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Likewise, Liam Cunningham as Captain Crewe plays a devoted father, and I loved how his scenes of war coincided with Sara's storytelling: the magic poison of the demon Ravana becomes mustard-gas in the trenches, and Ravana's roars become the scream of war-planes overhead.<br />Eleanor Bron excellently plays the aristocratic Miss Minchin, with her exterior of charisma, grace and culture underlying her inner spite and nastiness. However, Bron does not play her simply as the one-dimensional bad guy, and neither is she without her moments of humanity: she obviously finds it difficult in telling Sara that her father has died, and when Sara finally confronts her head-on, Minchin's hastily wiped-away tears tell us better than any words that she never had a father as loving as Sara's was.<br />Alfonso Cuaron directs &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and does so beautifully, from the povery-stricken streets of New York, where a single yellow rose is the only splash of colour, to the bright and exotic worlds of India that appear at intervals as Sara tells the mythological tale of Rama and Sita throughout the movie(and it's interesting to note that the actors that play these two lovers are the same that play Sara's own mother and father!) There are some sublime moments of imagery and beauty captured here, including the flower-sellers in the streets, Sara threading the dew-covered rose in the handle of the door, the black-clad lawyer watching the laughing girls, Sara spinning in the snow storm at her window...I could go on. And as all these scenes are coupled with appropriate music, be it strains of exotic India or a sorrowful choir, they remain in your mind for a very long time. In the simplist possible terms, this is a beautiful movie.<br />There are some things I didn't particulary like, such as the amnesia plot device that they use on Captain Crewe (though I admit there wasn't really a way around this), the fact that Sara has the upper body strength of a grown man when she manages to hoist herself up on the windowsill by her fingertips, and the completely un-neccessary love story between Minchin's sister and the milkman. However, worst for me was the last scene in which Miss Minchin appears: beforehand we had witnessed the depths of her her wickedness when she lies about Sara's parentage even though Captain Crewe is standing right before her. After the father and daughter's tearful reunion, we see her standing in the rain and turning away, alone with her hate.

I close my eyes and fast-forward every time I see it.<br />Although ultimately I think I liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; more, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is its more than worthy follow-up, with almost every particular magnificently created (though incredibly different from the original novel!)

In the simplist possible terms, this is a beautiful movie.<br />There are some things I didn't particulary like, such as the amnesia plot device that they use on Captain Crewe (though I admit there wasn't really a way around this), the fact that Sara has the upper body strength of a grown man when she manages to hoist herself up on the windowsill by her fingertips, and the completely un-neccessary love story between Minchin's sister and the milkman. However, worst for me was the last scene in which Miss Minchin appears: beforehand we had witnessed the depths of her her wickedness when she lies about Sara's parentage even though Captain Crewe is standing right before her. After the father and daughter's tearful reunion, we see her standing in the rain and turning away, alone with her hate. Her story should have ended here with this powerful scene, but instead we get a truly awful continuation where she is working as a chimney-sweep - a conclusion as implausible as it is silly. I close my eyes and fast-forward every time I see it.  <br />Although ultimately I think I liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; more, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is its more than worthy follow-up, with almost every particular magnificently created (though incredibly different from the original novel!)

B00005A46T|4.0|Alright this cd is good. it has some neat songs like Left Behind and New Abortion, but the mai nthing I came to say is that there is a new Slipknot CD May 25, 2004
0385504209|4.0|This is a very good book.  Period.<br />I noticed a lot of &quot;smart&quot; people complaining about inaccuracies in the grammer and historical elements of this book.  Hey, THIS IS A FICTIONAL NOVEL.  And a good one.  It's well written and very entertaining.  Are some elements kind of stretch?  Yes.  Do they detract from the story? On the contrary.<br />This should be on your read list unless you're too obstinate to overlook the fiction portions of the book.<br />Having said all that, I will say that I did not enjoy this book as much as Angels &amp; Demons for 2 primary reasons.  1) the characters in this novel are too similar to those in A&amp;D.  2) there are times in this novel where Mr. Brown seems to think that his characters need to stop using their brains long enough to let the ready &quot;solve&quot; a problem or &quot;crack&quot; a code.  The main characters seemed to have the hardest time solving the easiest problems.  He writes these instinces off by insinuating that they are trying too hard or looking too deep, but it comes off like a blatant attempt to allow us, the readers, to show how brilliant we are by solving something before the characters do.<br />Regardless, this is a great novel....just not quite a great as Angels &amp; Demons.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I wasn't crazy about Alicia Keys until I heard the record &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;. When I first heard that record I was mesmerized, so I decided to buy the album. The album start off very, very good. It demonstrates how talented she is from the start. I am so sorry that I slept on her for so long.

B00006LSM3|4.0|When George Harrison succumbed to cancer in November 2001, he had been working on his first new solo album since 1987's &quot;Cloud Nine.&quot; Fortunately, he had enough new songs in the can before his death to complete the album, albeit new songs that were missing instrument &amp; vocal overdubs here &amp; there. So, it was up to George's son Dhani Harrison and longtime friend Jeff Lynne (of ELO fame) to put on the finishing touches, and release the album to the world. The album, &quot;Brainwashed,&quot; was released at the end of 2002, and it's a very fond farewell to this great, gifted musician. Although Harrison's voice sounds a bit thinner on &quot;Brainwashed&quot; (no doubt due to his cancer), he still sings with great warmth and feeling, and his guitar playing is, as always, wonderful. And the songs are all excellent, feel-good numbers that could have come from no one else *but* the man known as the quiet Beatle. Favorites include &quot;Any Road,&quot; the fun &quot;P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night),&quot; the lovely instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; (for which Harrison won a posthumous Grammy award), the gorgeous pop of &quot;Stuck Inside A Cloud,&quot; Harrison's cheerful  ukelele rendering of the old favorite, &quot;Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea,&quot; and the closing title track, which ends, appropriately enough, with Harrison and his son Dhani performing a spiritual chant.While it's sad that George Harrison is no longer with us, he will live forever through his music, and his musical legacy has now been given a beautiful final chapter with &quot;Brainwashed.&quot; Farewell George, and God bless.
0071373586|5.0|Positioning is the idea that shook Madison Avenue to its core in the 1970s. Ries and Trout published what the high priests of Madison Avenue deemed as heresy. These two upstarts dared to take the voodoo out of marketing - and marketing has not been the same since.<br />Over the years I have given away countless dozens of Positioning. I have found two types of recipients: (1) Those who view it as a book on marketing, and (2) those who truly \\"get it.\\"<br />Positioning is not actually about marketing, though that is its platform. It is about how the human mind works. The principals taught in this book apply across all of our lives - from how we are viewed by our friends to why we affiliate with a particular political party or other social cause. Learning how Positioning works is learning about life.
B0000029GA|5.0|there is to much beef in hip hop these days, but i just gotta set it straight for quannum from cali. First i must admit i'm westcoast, and i generally really like or love all that stuff you cited in your review (quannum, heiro, etc.) but seriously-is there any artist on any of those labels that would ever dare to say any of their sh*t is better than this? no way...there is a raw, braggadocio, bottled lightning -tyle, confident, thematic, genius to this album that is unparalled under the circumstances. Don't you ever feel that b-licious flow is a little nasal and artificial at times? this was made in 1994. I will conclude by submitting, that, were it not for the excellence of the beautiful and sublime illmatic, half, minimum, of those groups you love would not have been relevant. thats my word.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I was particulary surprised, after the movie, that the movie was so focused on the characters before the action. Peter Weir does an excellent job with his firm grip on the men of the ship is the angle of the story that grabs your attention. <BR>Excellent cinematography, a well-written script and terrific performances all-around help Weir in his navagation of this Academy Award nominee (it actually received ten nominations).<BR>Definantly a movie that deserves more than one viewing to truly admire.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|The music on this soundtrack is amazing. It is great to listen to. You can feel the movie in the music. It brings back memories of Johnny Depp and the ocean in the Pirates of the Caribbean.<BR>It is wonderful when music conveys the feel of the movie so clearly.
B0000062FJ|4.0|The first Santana album. <BR>This is where it all began (with studio albums anyway, check out Live At The Fillmore '68) and what a start!<BR> Carlos Santana on Guitar<BR> Gregg Rolie on Organ and Lead Vocals<BR> David Brown on Bass<BR> Jose 'Chepito' Areas on Percussion<BR> Mike Carabello on Percussion<BR> and Michael Shrieve on Drums<br /> okay bases are loaded, the game is about to start...<BR> <BR>STATS<BR>'Waiting' - a really smooth instrumental with brutal Hammond organ and pounding persistant percussion. Santana's guitar is relatively tame at this point, but that's just to trick the opposition at this early stage in the game.<br />'Evil Ways' - the Top 10 HIT, comes in, another smoothie, but lyrically sharp and passionately latin. Ready to set the game straight.<br />'Shades Of Time' - quite a ballad in a way, the tactics continue, but it is building up. Rolie's vocals are more edgy and his Hammond is beginning to burn with World Series anticipation. Santana's guitar is hitting it, too.<br />'Savor' - straight into Savor, the Latin Lysergics are really going for it now, the percussion of Areas and Carabello is beginning to fire up.<br />'Jingo' - it's still going on in this vein, the intimidation of the Latins is working and oh!-<br />'Persuasion' - they're in there! And they're leading. Everything's brutal. The Grateful Dead Devils weren't expecting that.<br />'Treat' - the Latins are so ahead, thay've got time to cool down. Rolie's piano skills are coming to the fore here, and the percussionists are right on the ball.<br />'You Just Don't Care' - they're back and they're heavy with intimidation and the All-American-Part-Nicaraguan-Part-Mexican spirit of competition and decimation. Dynamic and brutal.<br />'Soul Sacrifice' - the icing on the cake of total flawlessness. The world series in their sights, and no, wait, Michael Shrieve's drum solo - man that was unexpected - that's taken them to the top. They are the champions.<br /> Bonus Tracks STATS<br /> 'Savor' a spirited feeling of celebration is in order!<BR> <BR> 'Soul Sacrifice' the track that won them the match! Now played live in the Dead Devil's faces and fifty times better. Brown's bass is superb!<br /> 'Fried Neckbones' the finale! They'll be back soon to take on the Jefferson Joints next season, hope you'll be watching, er listening!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore deserves every last award he has won this year for the music to The Return of the King. He is by far the best score composer in film these days.<br />This soundtrack is beatiful and haunting and majestic - and a complete epic in itself. It is everthing the film is.<br />If you loved the movie, get this CD. Everytime you play it, you will be transported back to the film. A wonderful music experience !
B0000C7PQK|5.0|There's no question i was excited for Voyageur's release, being a big fan of Enigma and all. This is album is obviously different from the &quot;traditional&quot; Enigma that i have grown accustomed to over the years, but it does present a new style with a bit of the old twist. This isn't Enigma's best album, but it is worth buying. If you've enjoyed Enigma in the past, you'll most likely approve of the album, just give it time to grow on ya. It took me a couple days. This album is pretty well balanced, some tracks were obviously better than others. <BR>04-Page of Cups, 05-Boum Boum, 07-Look of Today, and 10-the Piano are the ones that stuck out for me.<BR>I just wished there were more tracks with Ruth-Ann. That would've been super :)
B00004STPT|5.0|Just beautiful..absolutely beautiful. Nothing like getting awesome music to your favorite movie and being able to see in your mind every scene of the movie as the music plays out. The score is just delicious..one of my favorite soundtracks. I also recommend Last of the Mohicans which rates right up there with this one. I'm such a fan of celtic and/or haunting music. I can't take the Gladiator cd out of my stereo..so happy I bought it.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|This, Cannibal Corpse's 9th full-length release (not counting the live album) is, to me, their best since &quot;The Bleeding.&quot; Everything has improved - George's vocals seem more aggressive and punchy, with more gruesome screams, and all the musicians definitely show improvement. I was completely blown away. They are now employing occasionally slower tempos and catchier riffs, and the songs are incredibly well-constructed and keep you pinned to the wall mercilessly. Lyrically, yes, they are still their old gory selves, but hey, it's what they like.<br />  Now, the DVD included here really sheds some light on the band as PEOPLE and MUSICIANS. My jaw dropped when I saw them playing &quot;Frantic Disembowelment!&quot; Phew! These guys can really play.In short, &quot;The Wretched Spawn&quot; is a major improvement for this band, a landmark album in their careers that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that they are on top of their game, and are still, after fifteen years, the most brutal and technical, yet &quot;catchy&quot; Death Metal band around.
B00005OAA6|4.0|No Victoria Beckham did NOT have the worst voice of the Spice Girls.  That dubious honour goes to one Ms Halliwell.  VB's voice however is more style than substance...but as we all know...this girl has STYLE!  This album was cruelly overlooked and underappreciated by the UK.  A good pop/r&amp;b-light album to shake your ass too. One criticism is that there are too many ballads and the r&amp;b bit is rather tired.  If Victoria sticks to POP/dance she'll do fine.  Check out her new single LET YOUR HEAD GO.  Wicked!
B000002L99|5.0|Let me start saying I'm a huge Van Halen fan, and have every records of the band. This one, is a must have for any rock fan and Van halen fan!! It simply kicks ass, literally! David Lee Roth is out of the band, it's very sad indeed, but Sammy is also amazing and a very good performer! The songs blows you away, I can remember when I got this album for the first time years ago and I was jumping all around the house listening to Get Up, Dreams, 5150, Good Enough, Summer Nights and other amazing tracks!! Now it seems they're returning with Sammy!!! I'll gonna make my child's dream come true if I could see them alive!! Man, I just can't wait for the official pronnounce of Mr. Eddie and the guys!! Get this amazing record, you won't regret!! GET UUUUUUP, AND MAKE IT WORK, MAKE IT WORK!!
B000000WFF|5.0|The second best POP album of the 90's.  The first being SPICE!  From the get go the girls are at their loud, sassy, brazen, selves with nonsense lyrics and killer choruses sure to get your butt moving.  The Spice Girls, bless em, came out at a time when the music industry was at it's miserable, self pitying, depressing, stuck up, worst and gave it the kick in the arse it desperately needed!  And with really big shoes too!<BR>The last official  POP HURRAH of the 90's--pop music after this went down hill.  Very fitting the last line in the last song \\"The Lady is a Vamp\\" is \\"HAHAHA....thank you very much!\\"
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye's newest is worth it's money. As much as I look for good lyrics this album is still worth it.  The beats themselves are really catchy and just great.  As his debut album, I give Kanye the credit he deserves. Although some songs are weak i still say &quot;GOOD JOB!&quot;
0399226907|5.0|In school we also \\"grow\\" real butterflies and we read this book<br />and we watch the butterflies \\"hatch\\"  The children are very interested in this book because they can relate to his growing up and  all the foods that he eats that become beautiful colors.<br />Great Book!<br />EMW
B00003CXAY|4.0|The first film, \\"Koyaanisqatsi,\\" is superior, but the second film, \\"Powaqqatsi,\\" has many visually stimulating moments as well.  \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" was a landmark film when it was first released, using time-lapse photography and other trick-cinematography to show the world in a new way.  There are many provocative moments, my personal favorites being shots of landscapes and night-time city-scapes accelerated.  The final shot of a rocket exploding is simply visceral to the point of being haunting.  I can still see the swirling, fiery image days afterward.  Now, for the second film.  \\"Powaqqatsi\\" has some amazing shots, as well, but it lacks the first film's unique originality, using many of the same techniques from the first film but with fewer jarring sequences.  However, the score to the second film is what really carries it to the end.  The music, in my humble opinion, is more memorable and gives a sense of worldly ambience.  Indeed, I loved the score so much that directly after watching \\"Powaqqatsi\\" I went on-line and purchased the CD.  As a combination, these two films are engrossing, dated here and there, annoying at times, but overall, emotionally moving.  What sold me on the 2-pack is the fact it's only a couple of bucks more for both.  To me, it was worth it.  It's like I got the second film as a rental that I never have to return.  Adios.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Are you kidding? This cd is amazing. Those of you that gave it one star...I wonder if we were listening to same cd. I admit most of the songs seem to go on the same note and the album is mellow, but I think that is where I find most of it's charm. Norah's sultry and husky voice gives me goosebumps. This album is one you can listen to during a romantic candlelit dinner, a slowdance, or relaxing in a hot bath. When I want to unwind I listen to Norah Jones. In my opinion this cd is a breath of fresh air and different then anything on the charts. For those of you ready to hear something magical listen to this cd.
B00004TDTO|4.0|I saw this film for the first time with friends when we rented it and watched it during an all night horror marathon. I loved the movie instantly and knew i had to have it in my collection. Chrissy, an Amity Island teen is killed by an unknown force while skinny dipping one night. The next day, her date from the previous night reports her murder- and remains to police sherrif Martin Brody. He and others are baffled on just how she was killed and assume it was a &quot;boating accident&quot; until a young boy is killed by the same force in a crowd of swimmers. Chaos ensues as resident fishermen wage a war on the killer of Amity island. The once peaceful island soon becomes a battle ground to find the killer. Brody calls in an expert to tell him and his greedy superiors who insist the beach should stay open for money what it is killing people. Matt Hooper from the oceanagraphic institute arrives and comes to the direct conclusion that it is a Great white shark. The hunt for the shark settles down after the fishermen think they caught it but after the real shark kills another man and sends Brody's son Mike into shock, Brody takes up an offer from captain Quint, a crazy shark killer who was on a ship that was attacked by 5 sharks at once and survived. The mayor finally gains some common sense and closes the beaches off for the hunt to begin. Now it's Brody, Hooper, and Quint against a shark that isn't showing any signs of giving up. This was the first real summer blockbuster ever and started that trend. Like most of Spielberg's films, this was based on a fear of his and was an adaption of a bestselling novel. Jaws has it all and had 3 sequels. 2 is just as good as one but 3 and 4 need a lot of plot development. But watch this movie. Who knows, if you are ever against a shark on a sunken boat with an oxygen tank and a shotgun, watching this can help you survive. Worst case scenario of course.
B000002UB3|5.0|First,everybody knows that Abbey Road is a masterpiece,perhaps thje greatest abum ever and reports are its the beatles biggest seller.Second,theres a pathetic imbecile who calls itself duran durans biggest fan,cranky reviewer,agitated reviewer,ect.,who is so in need of a life he/she/it reviews great albums,then spouts idiocy (poor thing is just screaming for attention).
B000002UAR|5.0|Best album?  All time?  Yes.  <BR>Perfect?  Some people rate Here There and Everywhere as Paul's best, and others find it insipid.  A little slack still has to be given to George.  And it surely would have been bettered by the inclusion of Rain and Paperback Writer.<BR>But taken as a whole, this stuff is life enhancing, death defying and beyond rational criticism.  Paul was the brilliant craftsman to John's shaman explorer.  George Martin forever personifies production.  <BR>Blonde on Blonde?  Banana?  Smile?  No, the Beatles set the mark with this historic recording, and it's hard to imagine how it could ever be bested.
B000002LMK|1.0|What can I say nice about this cd? Well, nothing actually, from the scratchy guitar, moronic lyrics, and crappy singing of Young this cd is a complete stinker. I suppose if you're a pinko. you'll love it, but I think the dope (Young) should just grow up.
B00005ABX0|3.0|Right now the SMILE fanatics are going nuts, and rightly so.  A finished live version has been witnessed, recorded and lavishly praised.  The CD of rock's holy grail is due to hit the stores this fall.  This time they can print up the liner notes with a little more confidence, hopefully.<br />What a curio Smiley Smile will be compared to the original vision.   A little sad and silly, but with some definite personality.  Wild Honey is desperate and professional, with a little attitude. But the double album pales to the one genuine classic single that is included, as well as the &quot;alternate&quot;  version of Heroes and Villains that confidantly shows off what the Smile album was supposed to sound like.  The other extras are classic single variations, followed by a very live family croon, and ending with a lost gem. <br />A couple of really nice items amongst two weak albums.
068484267X|5.0|Everything I'd like to say has already been said by everyone else, but I just wanted to say I could NOT put this book down.  This book also made me cry..and I never cry when I read a book.  I cried for three days at least, because a mother's pain translates universally and I was just imagining what if this was my family, and all this stuff was happening to my children?  <br />Read this autobiography..you won't be disappointed.
0451191153|5.0|If you've been thinking of reading a book by Ayn Rand but think that Atlas Shrugged is a little to mountainous to tackle right off, The Fountainhead is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the method of writing by Ayn Rand.  Rand is a wonderful writer--all of her stories are excellently writen, have a very well defined plot, her characters are extremely well thought out, and she is able to weave a strong purpose into the story.  Ayn Rand is my favorite writers because the plots and storylines in her books are very well thought out.  I hate reading a book that leaves gaps and loop holes in the story and where the characters are whish-washy at best.  If you're tired of books that leave you feeling empty and that your time was wasted, then pick up this book.  This book is a worthy investment!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw this film knowing little about it and thought it was lovely.  My friend who I saw it with thought that it was &quot;OK&quot;, and had the same problem I've seen many reviews articulate: that the characters were much too distant.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed this distance, it reminds me somewhat of that aspect of Hemingway's writing.  I understand that this movie didn't &quot;do it&quot; for my friend, and she understood that it affected me differently.  That is why I don't understand the viciousness which so many of the reviews on Amazon hold.<br />I can understand many of the criticisms in the 1-star reviews for this movie.  Some I don't, like the comments about racism and portraying the Japanese poorly; this movie isn't meant to show the Japanese in a balanced and politically-correct light, it's meant to emphasize the bizarre and disconnected feelings that these already melancholy Americans [who aren't particularly thrilled to be there in the first place] are experiencing.  It's a feeling that's difficult to articulate without seeming offensive and narrow-minded in our PC-obsessed world.  But, ok, even the people who saw racism in this movie are entitled to their opinions.<br />What I do not feel they are entitled to is accusing those of us who did enjoy this film of being either &quot;elitist intellectuals&quot; or followers unable to form an opinion for themselves.  Though it's inevitable that there will be people who only say they like this film to impress their friends, I don't see why one should get so angry because different people were touched by this film while they were not.  There are even reviews by people who might be considered [by the people who use this expression in a derogatory manner] &quot;intellectual elitists&quot; who disliked this film, for their own reasons, and so it seems ridiculous to label all of us who enjoyed it as such.<br />As I said before, if you hated this movie, then I'll respect your opinion as long as you respect mine.There are many films considered &quot;wonderful&quot; or &quot;brilliant&quot; that I've hated, but I won't berate those who enjoyed them.  This film works for some, and for many of the same reasons fails for others.  Clearly, Sophia Coppola wasn't trying to make a film that everyone would like.  It is simply like any good piece of art: you may or may not like it, but it has certain indisputable [and disputable] merits that must be recognized.  Honestly, I'm glad that the whole world didn't fall in love with this film.  It would get pretty boring to be constantly saying, &quot;Wow. That was great.&quot;  Now we actually have something to talk about.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|No matter what anyone else said about this movie I really enjoyed it. I completely identified with the characers. There are times when you just wanna laugh,cry, cheer,and completely slap Kirsten Dunst. I fully plan on buying this dvd it's worth buyig but if your still sceptical rent it.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie rates only a little higher than my &quot;all time worst&quot; - and that was &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot; with Barbra Streisand... yuck!  It is also the second movie which pained me so much watching it that I could not bear to inflict the entire thing upon myself.  I walked out of Up... this one I just hit the &quot;stop&quot; button.  No way this movie could or should have been seriously considered for best picture.  Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor.  Much as I love the guy in other movies (Groundhog, Knew too Little) I had a hard time believing he was &quot;serious&quot; about this role.  The more the movie went on, the more it seemed that he would really rather be &quot;someplace else&quot; (not trying to act the horrible script, for example).  The humor was unfathomable and had a mystic, &quot;should I laugh here?&quot; quality to it.  <br />I despised the agony I felt watching this movie.  Don't buy it, rent it, or go anywhere near it.  If you do, I warned you!!!
0790731894|5.0|C'mon, that says it all, man. He dies! That alone is worth this movie. (In fact, I never watched past his death, but I figured it deserved 5 stars for that alone. More movies should do this.)
0385510438|5.0|John Grisham returns to the formula which made him famous in his latest book, &quot;The Last Juror&quot;.  He uses a combination of setting (Mississippi in the newly-desegregating 70's) unforgettable characters, and a plot which has enough twists to keep the reader interested and guessing.  In this book a young man named Willie Traynor has talked his wealthy grandmother into buying him a small-town newspaper with a shrinking circulation.  He manages to expand the paper's readership by including human interest stories and just enough controversy to keep the Letters to the Editor column full.  When there is a brutal rape and murder, everyone knows that is is Danny Padgitt of the notorious Padgitt Family who did it.  The dying woman had his name on her lips and Danny had her blood on his clothes.  The Padgitts are extremely powerful people in the community and Willie and his friends doubt that he will be convicted.  After the trial Danny threatens all of the jurors, and Mississippi laws (which Grisham admits to exaggerating) allow him to be released from prison much sooner than the town of Clanton expects.  Grisham delves into race relations, crooked politics, bad laws, and our all-too-human tendency to judge people without knowing all of the facts.  This book has a bit over everything and should be a winner with old and new Grisham fans.
0061015725|3.0|Remember the plot of Jurassic Park?  The well meaning scientists, the crazed mercenaries, the bewildered civilians and the villians---tons of ready-made living dinosaur meat cultivated from Jurassic era DNA?  All this made for a good story and a fully blown cinematic spectacle when the creatures were brought to life on the big screen.<br /><br />That's pretty much the tale of Prey---instead of dinosaurs, the menace consists of a &quot;swarm&quot; of nano-sized computers created by a Silcon Valley hardware/software company that again have gotten out of control.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person by Jack, the husband and temporary Mr. Mom of his family---wife Julia works tediously long hours at Xymos---the computer firm experimenting with nanotechnology.  Jack senses something odd about his wife's newly found vehemence for her job and suspects an extramarital affair.  It is only when he is hired as a consultant to iron out some of the bugs in software procedures written by a team he managed at another company and purchased by Xymos to perfect the project Julia is heading, that he gets a glimmer of what really is going on inside of his wife's head.<br /><br />With his usual finesse, Mr. Crichton does an admirable job of presenting a difficult subject in language that a layperson can appreciate--if not fully understand.  Of all of his most recent offerings, 'Prey' demands the reader's partial comprehension of the essence of nanotechnology to at least authenticate the book's premise.  Jack speaks computer-ese easily, but if you are not at least familiar with older programming techniques you will find the differences that Jack accentuates in his explanations regarding goal-oriented programming as opposed to parallel programming, downright unfamiliar territory.<br /><br />Otherwise, the plot follows the usual techno-suspense formula--the reader finds himself/herself turning pages at rapid fire speed as the characters combat a force that they created but no longer can control.  I found myself speed-reading to learn more about the science itself which Crichton expertly weaves in with his action-packed storyline.  The actual denouement borders on the predictable---updating the Frankenstein story with all its frightening repercussions---arrogant man infinging on a Nature that he does not fully understand yet feels confident in altering.<br /><br />Recommended to those who like cutting edge science and a fast paced story.ontrol.

B0001ENY6M|1.0|At times, I swore i was listening to the Last Temptation of Christ OST by Peter Gabriel, and at other times, the soundtrack from Titanic by James Horner.  This composer really cobbled the thing together from pre-existing pieces. Nothing new here folks. Move on.
B00005JMX4|5.0|I heard THE GIRL NEXT DOOR was going to be RISKY BUSINESS meets AMERICAN PIE.  Though this film certainly borrowed from the classics, it did it in a way that made you feel like you hadn't seen anything like it before.<br />Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful as the \\"girl next door,\\" a porn star gone good who falls for the cute Emile Hirsch.  Trouble ensues when her producer, played brilliantly by Timothy Olyphant, interferes with their plans for happiness.  In the end, everything is resolved in a pleasing and comically satisfying way.<br />This film is Rated R, as well it should be, for sexual content and language.  Anyone from age 17-80 should enjoy it immensely, even if they are slightly offended.  I HIGHLY recommend this film to any and all.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|What I liked most about this film is that it raises questions; your thoughts don't stop at the movie theater EXIT door. If this was Morris's aim, he succeeded. This documentary would make a great companion to a history class: I imagine when we read \\"Hiroshima\\" in 7th grade, how this would have spurned many philosophical and political discussions about the nature of war and the US's place in the world as the greatest superpower. <br />The interview technique using the \\"Interrotron\\" was perfectly suited to Robert McNamara's expressive personality; McNamara is a fascinating figure whether you like him or not and though he is forthright on many accounts, he still leaves unanswered questions. Why exactly? There is more I'd like to know about that, but I think McNamara will take some of this to his grave. There are some great anecdotes and a few tearful moments, but I won't spoil--all I can say is that at one point I couldn't hold back streaming tears. I might mention, too, that though the editing of the 20+ hours of interviews with him is noticeable, it is verbally seamless. <br />There is war footage I don't recall seeing before. I've already pre-ordered the DVD just to go back and slow-mo through some of the rapid-fire images of the incinerations of Japan, maps and taped conversations between JFK, LBJ and McNamara. Morris melds these images, along with some artful images of his own, to convey the recurring motif of domino theory. I could have handled another hour of this no problem.<br />Being a longtime fan of Philip Glass, his scores don't overpower this film and matches each segment and mood well, whereas, say in \\"Koyaanisquatsi\\" his music seemed to be so much the movie itself. I recognized a piece from my 1987 record of his, \\"Dance Pieces,\\" an excellent CD worth visiting. Glass's expertise at matching beautiful music to dropping bombs (which there are many frightening, yet hauntingly beautiful shots of in this film) is unparalled. This was a project of stellar collaboration. Glass's music is more subtle here, which is as it should be. <br />I wish this was the most talked about film right now rather than Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion...\\" It's a shame it's not in the big theaters here--it's analogous timing couldn't be better. I'm really curious what Donald Rumsfeld would think of it, for wouldn't he be remiss not to see it? <br />I hope this film gathers much momentum, especially in DVD. I had seen \\"Capturing The Friedmans\\" before the Oscars and was rooting for that, but I now see that the Oscar \\"The Fog Of War\\" received was well-earned.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it... which happened to be this year. The only reason i saw it so late was because no one would give me a straight answer as to what it was about. Finally a co-worker who is also one of &quot;the best f-ing cash-man's that ever lived&quot; told me what it was about and coerced me to buy the movie. I freaking watched it that night, even though i had final in my social-psych class the next day. I tryed to study for a while, but the movie took me in, and reminded me so much of how work was for me. I hate customers, but what am i going to do about it. The thing Randal says about working would be great if there were no customers is soo true. Another thing this movie points out is how many things can happen in one day, its amazoning; i've never seen such a sequential movie like this before.<br />One thing i'm glad he left out was that alternate ending, it would have made the movie so bleak, and alot less likely for people to get into. It would have really dragged the movie down if he kept it in.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This, in my opinion, is the best out of the 5 (soon to be 6) volume saga. Out of all the Star Wars movies, this is the most creative, the most out there, the most visually amazing out of them all. Sure the characters aren't that developed, but then again, is that really why people watch Star Wars? I mean, in this movie we are shown, an amazing undrwater bubble city called Otoh Gunga, a Roman-ish Babylonian-ish city called Theed, and an entire planet taken up by city called Coruscant. These kinds of ingenious visions are why I, and many others, like the Star Wars saga.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Forget the kissing of madona. She should just become liek Christina Aguilara, and basically show more her body to sell her cds she could even put a poster inside each cd case, or forget the cd all together and just put pictures of her inside.<br />Obviously i'm not being serious with this review, but still i do believe that this *IS* what she is doing, or trying to do. That madonna publicity stunt made her and madonna's cds sales go up; don't ask me why people would think music in any way shape or form would evolve into images of them kissing; it might be that people think of the image of them kissing when they hear the music. But anyway sooner or later she is going to do more drastic &quot;publicity stunts&quot; do get her sales up.<br />Shes a ok singer, bad lyricist, and knows that she is out with the old.

0385504209|2.0|Okay, I admit it... I was hooked at first, but about halfway through, I got bored.  This book was so predictable and I couldn't believe how many times the author used the word &quot;plethora&quot;!  Remember, this book is FICTION.  Its interesting to read, but don't spend money on it... Do what I did and borrow it from a friend.
0316666343|1.0|I didn't like the book, at all.  I thought there were several character flaws.  Susie was a dry, sarcastic character, which I found to be more rude and disconnected... I couldn't grow to like her.  Her younger sister.. I thought her to be too mean spirited in the beginning.. and felt she cared less about Susie's death.. the only consistency was the parents.. <br />Boring.. dark characters.. a gloomy and grey story.  I couldn't grasp the &quot;love&quot; of the story, that so many others claimed to have experienced, after reading this book.  Allot of flash backs, and even before Susie was viciously murdered, she seemed to have already been an unhappy girl... This book was recommended to me.. and I'm going to save you the time and trouble.. that I didn't get the opportunity of.  I DO not recommend this book.  I'm sure everybody loves the ending.. yeah.. it was okay for me.. but wasn't worth the read.  A waste of time..
0679720200|4.0|THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE EXISTENTIALIST BOOKS SINCE PHYCHOLOGY CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL 15 YEARS AGO! I READ IT AGAIN THE OTHER DAY, AND IT STILL HAS THE SAME IMPACT, AND THE SAME MESSAGE (FOR ME): WE ARE ALL LITTLE MORE THAN SPECKS OF DUST IN AN ENDLESS UNIVERSE, FOREVER AT THE MERCY OF A GREATER BEING, A HIGHER INTELLIGENCE THAT HAS A PLAN FOR US.....OR IS EVERYTHING RANDOM?<br />THAT IS THE REAL QUESTION.<br />BUT IS \\"THE STRANGER\\" COMPLETELY PESSEMISTIC? I DON'T THINK SO. OBVIOUSLY THE STORY IS OPEN TO MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS AND IS VERY AMBIGUOUS IN THE END.<br />EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, PREFERABLY BY THE TIME THEY TURN 16 YEARS OF AGE.
B000065B2A|5.0|A sleeper that made the grade and graduated into the realms of Classic Flicks, Breaking Away is one of those wonderfully uplifting and subtly patriotic movies that champions small-town America. Steve Tesich won the screenplay Oscar for this semi-biographical story about four 19yo kids who can't quite decide what to do with themselves after high school. They live in Bloomington, Indiana, where the guys from the university look down on the townies and make derogatory comments about their rock quarrying forebears. One of them drifts, then runs, into the world of Italian bicycling, much to his used-car-salesman father's dismay and embarrassment. <BR>You'll feel yourself pulled into rising excitement as the marvelous finale hoves into view, and, though sorry to see the film end, you'll hit the rewind button with a big smile on your face.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash were not brilliant musicians technically, nor fantastic singers (Both Joe Strummer and Mick Jones took the lead), they simply knew what good music was and is. Their songs have great working class lyrics and a positive message. Original melodies and inventive music. Without a doubt the finest album by The Clash, and one of the finest albums ever recorded and compiled.
0385510438|5.0|I have read almost all of John Grisham's novels and I have enjoyed them in varying degrees. Until I bought this book I had considered A Time To Kill to be his best, even though it was his first and even though others were best sellers.<br />Grisham is a Son of Missisippi and he does his best writing when he return to his roots. Both of the novels I have just refered to are set in Ford County and the author knows that place like the back of his hand.<br />The people are real, the town is real and by the time you finish the book you figure you could find your way around there,too.<br />Willie Traynor is the narrator for this ride. He is a Yankee who went to Syracuse University, dropped out and found his way to The Ford County Times. It is a family owned weekly that has found it's niche by writing the best obituaries of all of its citizens that one can imagine,white or black. Including blacks is the idea of the current owner and as good as he is at writing obits, he is in no sense a businessman and the paper is forced into involuntary banckruptcy.<br />Willie has a rich grandma who cares about him and he convinces her to loan him $50,000 to buy the paper. Thus, in his early 20's, Willie takes charge of the local weekly.<br />Soon thereafter, a local woman is raped and murderd. The cirsumstances are terrifying and the accused is arrested with the victims blood on his shirt. The accused is a member of a local clan who live on an island just of the coast and whose lawless ways are well known.<br />Willie gets very involved in the trial and it's coverage. Previously he has befriended a black woman who ends up on the jury. The accused is convicted, but spared the death penalty by the same jury and is sentenced to two consecutive life terms. <br />Thats the good news. The bad news is that in Mississippi, life means 10 years. Th worse news is that somehow the consecutive terms have been made concurrent. This particular murderer has had the bad judgement to tell the jury that\\"If you convict me. I will kill you all.\\" Neverthe less he will be up for parole in less than ten years.<br />Nine year later, with the convicted felon out on parole, jurors start being killed and the town is in turmoil. <br />That is as far as I go with the story line. You need to read the rest to see how it comes out. I deduced the outcome about 20 pages from the end and you may or may not, but the important thing to remember is that this is Grisham at his best. Talking about the people he knows about and a town he understands. In so doing he draws us all into a better understanding of each other. This is a truly wonderful story. I hope you read it.
B00005J6UP|1.0|I bought the Goonies movie for my husband who loves this movie. Unfortunately the DVD keeps skipping.  Amazon does not take back dvds.  It was supposed to be a new copy.<br />Buyer beware!!!
B00006BTCA|4.0|I must be out of it these days. Generally when I hear words like &quot;Saviors of rock&quot; or &quot;overhyped garabage&quot;, I find it unfounded because my first exposure to Interpol was without pretense or hype. I stumbled onto them when I found that Amazon.com recommended them to me, along with Borders and a few other stores. My first song I heard was Obstical 1, which had me hooked from the get go. Simple arpegio guitars aligned with Ian Curtis-style vocals(nice and husky) over a simple but driving drum beat. I eventually bought the entire album and while it doesn't get consistant play, it was still a worthwhile buy none the less.<br />Interpol's strengths lie in bringing out the best of the past, evoking bands like Joy Division but playing them to their own persona and twist. The results are largely compelling with some slick, solid, simple song writing(though the lyrics can be a bit weak sometimes) and rich atmospheres. The best example lies in NYC, which really does paint a picture of a desolate, lonely NYC scene. Other songs either run back and forth from slick rock to moody melodies that are largely a sucess.<br />Interpol may not be the most original band in town and have certainly built themselves on the ground of being a band that loved Joy Division. But with tight musicianship, a strong vocal presence and a promise for evolution, we may see Interpol come into their own. Debuts aren't meant to be the definitive album but rather show promise for what could be. Turn On The Bright Lights shows a band just begining to show their capability.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|In examining Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I have come to examine the soundtracks of the three films.  Out of the three, I would have to say that this was one of my favorites...as the others are equally majestic.  The beautiful combination of instruments and powerful conducting and musical composition of Howard Shore truly brought to life J.R.R. Tolkien's novels.  The soundtrack is incredible and I highly recommend it to everybody.  Do yourself a favor, buy the soundtrack.. You won't regret it.  I don't!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Words I use to describe the debut album &quot;Chariot&quot; by Gavin DeGraw are: charming, soulful, genius, insightful, emotional, lasting, memorable, catchy and substantial!

I feel like I want to keep it a secret because it's soooo good but then I'm not good with secrets so I'm telling the world. This young man is electric in front of an audience and really enjoys the feedback of his people, his fans. We will be talking about Gavin DeGraw for years and years. Buy it now on Amazon.com!
2266083082|5.0|I would recommend this book as compulsory reading for anybody interested in the universal issues of good and evil and man's ability to overcome all obstacles in his pursuit of a higher goal.The sheer breadth and depth of the literary canvas of Hugo's book takes one's breath away.It deals with the remarkable transformation of one man, Jean ValJean, wronged and exiled by society, his transformation by a kind Vicar's example and the  trials and tribulations of his life as he strives to live by the Vicar's philosophy.<BR>It is a tribute to the human spirit and the power of a single determined man in the face of all odds.<BR>As relevant and meaningful today as when it was first written.
0739304615|1.0|I am an avid reader and huge Johathan Kellerman fan.  I have read many of his books and was excited to read his latest novel.  This is the first time in years I actually stopped reading a book in the middle out of interminable boredom.  This book is extremely slow moving.  Too much description and not enough action.  It was as if someone else wrote the novel under Jonathan Kellerman's name.  The language seemed forced, bombastic, and esoteric.  What a huge dissapointment. The only recommendation I would give for this book is to ask for your money back.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Obviously, the only way you'll enjoy this CD (from reading others reviews) is if you are a TRUE Linkin Park fan. I am. I love Hybrid Theory. I was hooked from the first time I listened to it. The same goes for this CD. I got this CD the day it came out and it's still my favorite CD! Linkin Park is the best band out there. I hate how everyone says that they stole the style from others like Korn and stuff because it's a bunch of bull. Linkin Park is original, they have their own great style that no one can match. Of course their songs are going to sound similar to their first CD. It's the same band for crying out loud! Everyone is saying &quot;well, this song sound like the one from their first cd&quot; and someone else says the same song sounds like a different one from their first cd. Apparently they don't know what they are talking about. GET THIS CD! You'll love it. Linkin Park is awesome. Don't listen to a bunch of squares who aren't even true fans.
B000002MIY|4.0|A Steely Dan record in all but name (would it have heaped Grammys had it been under the brand label?), Donald Fagen's second solo album had high art written all over it when it first came out in 1993. It cruises along with a strange detactched swing, set to some futuristic be-bop that only the coolest of futures could allow for. Millions of miles and a couple millennia away from the nostalgia of \\"The Nightfly,\\" Fagen steered his imagination into a vision of the (then) coming turn of the century, where an environmentally perfect steam driven vehicle could both transport you and grow you a salad. If you think that sounds bizarre, the truly weird thing is that the music is so slick and cool. In 1993, this was about as far off the mainstream as you could get.<br />Of course, \\"Kamakiriad\\" was roundly ignored. Too highbrow for ear candy aficionados, too slick for the exploding grunge scene, and lacking the marquee value of being a Steely Dan record, Fagen's ode to the \\"Wonderful World\\" of \\"IGY\\" just couldn't find an audience that was swallowing Jell-O shots of Michael Bolton or huffing up the heady magical odorous sulfur residue of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" But ya know something? Having just purchased \\"Kamakiriad\\" on DVD-Audio, it probably has a sturdier framework than most of what topped the charts that year. It most certainly has grown on me over the time since I originally picked up my CD copy ten plus years ago.<br />\\"Tomorrow's Girls,\\" the first single, is what \\"Peg\\" or \\"Hey 19\\" might have been, if the women in those songs were androids. Like a b-movie from the Roger Corman drive-in flicks of Fagen's youth, these spaced invaders landed on the Jersey Beaches like some freak form of \\"The War Of The Worlds.\\" Except they have a fat juicy bass pulsing under \\"a virus wearing pumps and pearls.\\" Great stuff, worthy of any of the best twists in the Steely Dan's often contorted story telling. (Almost as good is the despairing end of the road to Fagen's travelogue, \\"On The Dunes.\\")<br />Aside from that particular moment, \\"Kamakiriad\\" is a relatively sedate affair. It's a close parallel to the reunited Becker and Fagen's \\"Everything Must Go,\\" in that everything is recorded in as lush an environment as possible. This is the kind of music that makes home demonstrations of your DVD-Audio and 5.1 surround systems fun. There's no way that you can MP3 this and get that environment filling quality that is so lacking in a lot of today's recordings. And on top of that, \\"Kamakiriad\\" actually holds its own as a listenable collection of songs! Who could ask for more? (Well, if you don't already have \\"The Nightfly.....\\")unes.\\") <br />Aside from that particular moment, \\"Kamakiriad\\" is a relatively sedate affair.

B000053V7Q|5.0|This Music dvd of the king is fantastic. In the beginning there are some studio takes, and the group from elvis with james burton, john wilkinson, ronny tutt and others are practice for the concert he give in 1970 known as that's the way it is. The concert is flawless, Elvis sings so very good here you should almost forget that it is live recorded. One thing you can say about elvis if you hear this dvd. He was really THE KING
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I had never heard of Sarah until this album. Her use of the piano with just her voice is haunting.  She writes lonely, quiet, sad songs.  Very tasteful and artfully arranged.  I'm hooked.  I bought two older albums (Mirrorball and Surfacing) and will purchase more.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's BEST pictures ever.  After getting a bit fed up with cute aliens, dinosaurs, and little kids-This movie finally proved to me that Spielberg is definitely a director to be reckoned with!  This movie made such a huge impact on me, and continued to be one of my favorite top 10 movies of all time.  Not since JAWS has Spielberg gripped an audience in such a moving, and intriguing picture!  A MUST have for anyone who appreciates history, great filmmaking and the struggle of the human spirit!!
B00003CX9S|2.0|There is a reason that this movie recieved so many Oscar nominations; it's a movie meant for the occasion. The Elephant Man is better shot, better acted and all round better made then the majority of Oscar nominated movies but ultimately it's sentimental and doesn't meet out its own potential. I was very excited to rent this movie because the more and more I see by David Lynch the more impressed I am. Both Blue Velvet and the Straight Story (just to name two) absolutely wowed me with their vision and totally original feel. I'm convinced that Lynch is one of the most notable and important living American directors. The Elephant Man looks and sounds great, but the handling of the material is just average. In a lesser movie, this wouldn't be as infuriating but in a movie with such amazing visual atmosphere you kind of expect a depth of emotion. I thought that this movie wore its morals as a cub scout badge. There was so much more potential in the material. I wanted murkiness and ambivalence. Why do we react so violently and hatefully to ugliness? Did the doctor really care about his patient or was he just another ringmaster? And most importantly, what of class? The Elephant Man's happiness seems to be entirely dependent on his acceptance into high society. The people shown reacting ignorantly to the Elephant Man are all poor and dirty. Quite a simplistic attitude if you ask me. If you are looking for a tear jerker, rent this movie, you could do worse. If you are looking for Lynch with balls, Blue Velvet is your best decision.
0812550757|3.0|Speaker for the Dead is the second book Ihave read by Orson Scott Card, and I have to say I don't care much for his style.  How he starts every chapter with something relevant, but from a different point of view is cool.  But on the whole, he has much writing the bores me.  The first novel was really good.  This novel also had a really good plot.  There were points where I could not put the book down.  But then there were times I was wondering why I was reading.  Then again, I am not the interested in science fiction novels, and look more for excitement.  There were interesting topics that simply lacked excitement.<br />What happens.  Ender has survived many years by space travel.  He leaves his sister Valentine to go to a new planet where they have discovered a new race of beings with intelligence similar to humans.  He wants to keep the human race from destroying the pequennos and he wants to help a young girl whose role model was murdered by the piggies.  He arrives twenty two years after the murder took place to discover another murder had taken place and that the people of Lusitania were breaking the rules.  Rebellion or submission to the Starways council are the peoples choices.  Ender is the Speaker for the Dead.<br />An okay novel, but one I will probably never read again.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I enjoyed the film a great deal, and apparently for some of the reasons that many other people disliked it... the lack of plot line, and the less then in depth character development.<br />Yes there was little plot, but isn't that the point.  When we get lost in life, we lose our own plotline so to speak.  Bill Murray's character Bob Harris is in just that position.  His career has peaked, and he's no longer angry about it, just accepting.  The magic/excitement has gone out of his marriage, and he knows that his children have something to do with it, so its not bad, just different (because he loves having children - &quot;They are the best people you will know&quot;).  If he were at home in a more comfortable environment his state would be covered up in activites, friends, family, etc.  I mean why did he go golfing in the middle of the film?  To try to find something familiar that he could grab hold of.  Unfortunately for him it doesn't work either.  It is only with this young woman (well played by Scarlett Johansson), also lost, that he finds some solace, as they share their perceived problems.  <br />The fact that they don't have any real reason to be upset, doesn't matter either (I mean who wouldn't like to go to Tokyo for 2 million dollars to advertise whiskey). It is self perception that colors our lives, and each of these characters feels emptiness, and it is only their common feelings, and culture that brings them together.  Ultimately their friendship keeps each grounded in a foreign land.  In my personal favorite movie moment, Bill Murray states just that in the excruciating version of More than This, the Roxy Music song.  He looks at her and sings that there is nothing more then this, and in that moment Bob Harris means just that.<br />As far as the depth of character, how well do we know each other after a few days.  I was crazy about my wife, but what I knew about her was quite superficial as compared to the 13 years we have been together.  I know I wouldlike to know more about each character, but I definitely knew enough about each of them to care about them.  If I knew more about them, honestly I may like them less.  For example how old are his children or wife, compared to him.  Does he have a previous family that he left?  He is an actor after all.  We could come up with the same type of things for Charlotte.  Rather I want to know the characters from the few days they show us.  It is those people that I feel for.<br />I agree with the few who have written that it doesn't matter what he whispered to her at the end.  I, like the one previous reviewer, can't put it in words, but it works for me.  They are connected, and that is what matters.<br />I can't speak highly enough of Bill Murray's performance.  I did not see Mystic River, so I cannot compare his performance to Sean Penns, but did see Pirates, and I feel that his performance was at least as good as Johnny Depps.  I will continue to see his movies, because he is an outstanding actor, something I would never have thought possible fifteen years ago.<br />The scenes in Tokyo as almost all have agreed were wonderful to behold.  I really liked this movie, and do recommend it, but understand that like anything else it is not for everyone.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Contrary to the film, the soundtrack follows Tarantino's tradition, comparable to Pulp Fiction's soundtrack. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the film, hoping the soundtrack of the second part will be as good as the film itself.<br />The only annoyance is the lack of coherency between songs, but it's the same annoyance you'd feel in the film...
0385512104|5.0|Christopher John Francis Boone is a brilliant 15-year-old boy who has Asperger's Syndrome.  Asperger's is a sensorineuro condition that is on the spectrum with autism and is often regarded as high functioning autism.  Since Asperger's IS on the spectrum, there are behaviors and sensory responses that overlap.  As with any condition, autism and Asperger's are as varied as there are individuals who have it.<br />Although Chris does not have language delays or other cognitive issues, he DOES present sensory and social difficulties.  He cannot stand to have his food touching other foods on his plate; he is rigid about giving his EXACT age; (\\"I'm 15 and 3 months and 3 days\\"); he is gifted in mathematics and has a far reaching knowledge of prime numbers and mathematical properties; he has trouble interpeting nonverbal cues, e.g. facial expressions as well as verbal cues such as tones of voice.  His social challenges are what he feels set him apart more than his natural intellectual and academic gifts.<br />Chris is also a problem solver.  When a neighbor's beloved poodle is found killed and Chris finds the animal's remains, he vows to find the REAL killer.  A neighbor places Chris at the top of her short list of suspects and the boy is later taken into custody.  Agains the wishes and advice of parents and other concerned parties, Chris pulls the mask off of the real dog killer.<br />I love this book.  I am so delighted to see a book told from the autism/Asperger's point of view.  I am good and tired of stories like \\"Rain Man\\" that portray characters with autism as echolalic stereotypes who have concentrated areas of knowledge and no viable social skills.  I want more stories like this; Chris is a delightful, appealing and VERY plausible character.  Readers who are on the spectrum will certainly feel a literary bond to Chris.  Readers who are closely involved with people on the spectrum most likely will be captivated by the appealing boy with the resourcefulness to think of novel approaches.<br />Hats off to this book!f novel approaches.<br />Hats off to this book!
B00003CXXM|2.0|This 2002 film is based on the novel by Robert Ludlum.  Matt Damon is cast in the role of a man rescued from the sea by some French fishermen.  He has two bullet holes in his back as well as a small vial under his skin which reveals the number of a Swiss bank account.  He just doesn't know his name or anything else about himself.<br /><br />So far so good.  It's rather intriguing to watch Damon's acting, especially when he goes to the Swiss bank and discovers passports from many countries with his photo as well as lots of cash.  And, by the way, he also finds himself fluent in  French and German as well as English.<br /><br />All of a sudden, his life is in danger.  And so is the life of the pretty girl, played by Frank Potente, who only meant to give him a lift to Paris and never meant the relationship to develop past that.  Ha Ha!<br /><br />Somehow the CIA is involved and paid assassins are sent to kill our hero.  Chris Cooper is cast as the evil CIA commander.  It's an easy role and certainly below the quality of fine acting demanded in other films such as Seabiscuit and Adaptation.  But I guess that the powers that be know that he'll be good in whatever role is cast his way.<br /><br />There's lots of action, several murders and many chase scenes.  And I think I was supposed to care.  But I found the premise impossible to relate to, and the action similar to that in a thousand other films.  And when the plot got confusing, I actually fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of the film.
B000127LW2|2.0|Before I discuss the series, let me say that this set is way over priced.  $90.00 for 15 episodes (ep 1 is 90mins) is about $45.00 too much.<br />Voyager was at best hit and miss.  Good seasons were ones that had 1 or 2 good episodes and hopefully less than half sucked.  Once in a great while they'd actually have a great episode.<br />Watching the show, you couldn't help but think of Janeway as Star Fleet's Giligan.  I can't count the number of times they had a way home, but she'd find a reason why they shouldn't take it.  <br />Looking back, it's clear that Voyager marked the beginning of the end of Star Trek.  Berman simply has no ideas, and he's dragged Brannagh down to his level.  Instead of interesting shows with new ideas and stories, they gave us recycled TNG over and over again.  That trend has continued on Enterprise.<br />The best thing I can say about Voyager is that it kept Berman's hands off of Deep Space Nine.  As a result, Steven Ira Behr, Ronald Moore and many other talented writers were able to make a Star Trek that took chances week after week.  They created characters you could care about and story lines that were intrigued the viewer week after week.<br />Save your money.  Buy the TNG sets.  Better still, buy DS9 (arguably the best Trek series to watch on DVD).  If you have both of those, give the money to charity or use it to start a fire on a cold winter night, but don't support the mediocrity that is Star Trek: Voyager.
B00006M183|2.0|I remember when Pearl Jam was one of the best grunge/alternative bands out there...I also remember when Pearl Jam was NOT a political band.  Why do bands do this??  If you sing about politics, people that listen to your music arent going to make political decisions based upon your songs (if they dont agree with you already) and the people that have different views are going to stop listening to you.  I KNOW EDDIE VEDDER IS A DEMOCRAT!! I DONT NEED TO BE REMINDED IN HIS MUSIC!!  Why cant we just sing about human emotion and leave politics and religion for church and the white house?  Incubus, Nothingface, System of a Down and MTV this means you too!!!.......grunge died with kurt and lane...(we will always have &quot;ten&quot; and we arent going to miss eddie's new propaganda garbage that goes out of style when times change)
0345440900|5.0|I love and recommend this book. Its lessons are valuable--look at this child as a person, respect individuality, learn to balance real life with your baby's needs. Much of what she says is common sense and for that reason a real confidence builder for the new mom. Read this book as a guide, not a manual and enjoy being a new mom!
B000002JK2|5.0|This CD is a subtle pleasure, full of acoustic textures that simply delight, yet this rather unlikely assemblage of musians rocks out convincingly on several numbers.  The Ronnie Lane numbers are more stylistically similar than Townshend's, but that makes this CD all the stronger, as does the contrast in the two writers' styles.  And closing with 'Till The Rivers All Run Dry' is perfect.  Townshend's songs are initially more appealing, with My Baby Gives It Away, Keep Me Turning, Misunderstood, Street In The City and Heart To Hang On To easily beating anything (with the exception of Who Are you) that showed up on the subsequent Who LP.  Also, Townshend's Rought Mix is an tough instrumental that showcases the band's inimitable chops (Clapton plays stellar guitar throughout the CD).  Lane's songs are more subtle and (for me) need more listenings to fully appreciate.  Particularly moving are Annie and April Fool.<br />The one imperfect thing about this CD is the remastering, which is flat and hollow.  With great remastering, this CD would shine that much brighter.  Write WEA and let's get it done!!!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys arrived on the scene back in 2001 with her No.1, multi-platinum debut album \\"Songs In A Minor.\\" The Grammy award winning album made Alicia a worldwide superstar and a true force to be reckoned with in the music industry. Her debut album was ever so slightly overhyped which then made the follow-up, \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys,\\" ever so slightly over-anticipated upon its fall 2003 release. The album went straight to No.1 in its week of release shifting some 610,000 copies. Alicia has staying power, and this proved it.<br />Since that infamous debut album, Alicia Keys has brought in a unique and shockingly mature dose of talent to the music industry. Amongst her entrance was the arrival of Nelly Furtado and Norah Jones, two equally talented super powers who enjoyed record sales beyond their wildest dreams and a following like no other. Such success, however, can cloud the illusions of those experiencing it, no matter how deserved it is. Alicia Keys could have easily fallen into the trap of an artist who took herself too seriously (the dramatic title of the album suggests this) but, thankfully, there is no need to worry; The Diary Of Alicia Keys is another masterpiece...<br />On this sophomore effort, Alicia has avoided the frequent trap of crumbling under pressure on how to follow up a stunning debut. She has matured her style slightly with a superb collection of lush and dreamy soul-tinged, R'n'B influenced tracks that highlight and complement her remarkable vocals. Everything about the album is incredibly mature and real. Even the song titles are beautiful, staring off with the intro \\"Harlem's Nocturne.\\" This piano opening soon breaks out with a soulful beat in a similar vein to the intro on the album's predecessor. This swiftly moves into \\"Karma,\\" a superbly beat-driven song that uses Alicia's vocals to the optimum. \\"Heartburn\\" has a fantastic drum beat and strumming guitars with a sizzling beat and brilliant production. It's a new style for Alicia, and it works well. Some may dislike it, but you gotta give the girl props for being creative. \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By\\" is a superb cover version which has been altered to suit Alicia's vocal range and musical style. This is swiftly followed by \\"You Don't Know My Name,\\" the album's lead single. Obviously Alicia couldn't compete with her debut single \\"Fallin'\\" on her comeback single, so what does she do? She releases a six-minute, future-classic love ballad masterpiece with spine-tingling piano trickles and a full-on telephone section, remeniscent of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You!\\"<br />\\"If I Ain't Got You\\" displays Alicia's superb vocals perhaps better than on any other track. Alicia really sells the song and this is the second single. Meanwhile, the gorgeously-melodic \\"Diary (Featuring Tony! Toni! Tone!)\\" is a definite album highlight. The gentle piano creeps in here and drops to offer superb lyrics; \\"Just think of me as the pages in your diary.\\" \\"Dragon Days\\" is one of the album's highlights. Alicia sings of the dragon days when the fire was hot, like a desert needing water, baby! Her soulful voice totally complements the song's mature mood. \\"Wake Up\\" is yet another highlight with Alicia displaying her vocals once more in an up-tempo track about relationship troubles. Done a million times before, but still sounds fresh by Alicia. \\"So Simple\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but a lot of people can't stand it because of the little squeaky voice in the background of Lellow chanting, \\"It could be so simple!\\" The song has a rather isolated mood to it, but this only serves as the genius behind it.<br />\\"When You Really Love Someone\\" is an up-tempo song with a moody and confused intro that highlights the realism of a relationship and what each partner must do to love one another. \\"Cause a man just ain't a man if he ain't man enough,\\" cries Alicia, sounding similar to how she did on \\"A Woman's Worth.\\" \\"Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude)\\" is asuperb section that breaks the album up slightly. The beat just relaxes the hell out of you whilst also managing to make you feel so sexy with its seductive mood as Alicia whispers her (short) lines. \\"Slow Down\\" is not one of the best tracks on the album and Alicia could've been forgiven for leaving it off the album. Luckily things pick up with the sparkling \\"Samsonite Man.\\" What a beautiful song title! And Alicia's not wrong as she sings \\"Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go, packing his bags, gotta go,\\" to a shimmering beat that raises the mood. \\"Nobody Not Really\\" is a DAMN fine song that is just way too short. It only just makes the third minute but should've been at least one longer. The song opens in a flurry of excitement with its piano as a saxophone breaks it down whilst Alicia sighs in the background. The way her vocals are drawn out through the verses is just really superb and is a perfect closer to a brilliant sophomore effort.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />I bought Songs In A Minor after the hyped had died down somewhat - a whole year after its release. I really enjoyed that album and it's certain that the public did too. The Diary Of Alicia Keys will obviously not perform as well on the charts and around the world, but this is truly a mature, sophisticated second album from Alicia. It has future-classic written all over it. An album that will be in the homes of millions of soulful fans around the world, and her third album is just going to continue this trend.superb section that breaks the album up slightly.

B000001FTD|5.0|now for anthrax,everything about em is awesome but the one thing i dont get is that why did joey belladonna left anthrax, he's one of the best metal vocalist EVER sure his voice maybe high pitch but who cares he rules.the album starts with the title track among the living then caught ina mosh then i am the law then later the 6th track indians,these four songs are the best anthrax has ever writen,and the other songs also rule.anthrax had made some tributes in this album like stephen king(among the living,a skeleton in the closet)and anthrax's fav comic book character judge dredd (i am the law).the best song written by anthrax was caught in a mosh this whole song is fast,and joeys high pitch scream in this song is pretty cool,the best is the solo.if you dont have this album,get this now and i garuntee you will never be dissapointed
B000000WFF|5.0|Recipe for Spiceworld<br />Spices:  one dose each of baby (extra cute), sporty, scary, and posh (special black gucci mixture).  Oh, and lots of extra ginger (super hot)<br />Music:  pop with cheery keyboards, drum programming, with a layer of strings and orchestral arrangements, and a pinch of brass.<br />Medium:  one standard CD, 6 cm radius<br />Preheat CD player to desired volume, insert CD and press play.  Makes 10 servings per listen.<br />Yes, this was the soundtrack to their movie, though without their cover of Gary Glitter's &quot;Leader Of The Gang.&quot;  However, there's a noticeable overall consistent sound in all the songs, making it more polished, more pop, and less R&amp;B, meaning that the differences in sound (pop vs. R&amp;B), Stannard &amp; Rowe vs. Absolute that was noticeable on Spice has been totally blurred, despite the fact that both producers return here.  But it's a formula that works and made it one of my favourite albums of the year.  I shall do a blow-by-blow on the songs in order that they were played in the movie (minus the stuff from Spice, of course) for the benefit of those wanting to play the songs that way.<br />&quot;Too Much&quot; is the nice string-laden ballad that opens the movie, introducing Nutmeg, Paprika, Sage... oops!  I mean Baby, Posh, Ginger, Scary, and Sporty, with the quintet trading lines in the verses while singing in unison.  As usual, Mel C's got the keynote role here singing.<br />&quot;Do It&quot;, another upbeat song done when the Girls leave the recording of &quot;Too Much&quot; and into a throng of screaming and cheering fans, also features keyboards and programming by Magnus Fiennes, the man who launched techno-classical quartet Bond into stardom.<br />&quot;Denying&quot; does have some identifiable R&amp;B motifs key to producer Absolute's style.<br />Another fun tune and highlight, the mid-tempo &quot;Saturday Night Divas,&quot; was used when they were trying different costumes, even each others'.  There's a TLC-sounding quality when they sing &quot;Get down get deeper and down&quot; in unison.  All this and some computerized noises and string synths, too.<br />A brass section and the snappy drums highlight the energetic and fun-loving disco of &quot;Stop,&quot; emphasizing playing hard instead of being on the go.  One of the best songs here, and a single that deserved better in the US, but maybe that was soured with the then-recent news of Geri's departure.<br />Another engaging track that owes something to 70's style disco, with string arrangements courtesy of former Art of Noiser Anne Dudley, &quot;Never Give Up On The Good Times&quot; could've been a Rick Astley tune during his early Stock-Aitken-Waterman days.<br />Another ballad, &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, with strings arranged by Anne Dudley once again, and some Spanish-type acoustic guitar, was another single and standout cut.<br />&quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; is an infectious Spanish-inspired dance number that was done in the movie's climactic concert scene.  While a good number, I rate other numbers here over this one.<br />&quot;The Lady Is A Vamp&quot; played over the credits, features a 40's  sound, complete with orchestral arrangements, alternating between Andrews Sisters style harmonies and slow, lazy slow striptease music, replete with a flurry of references to pop culture icons such as Elvis, Jackie Onassis, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie's Angels, in contrast with the new female icon, &quot;a power girl in a 90's world.&quot;<br />Either I missed it or &quot;Move Over,&quot; the song used for their Pepsi commercial, with their salute to &quot;Generation Next&quot; was not in the movie.  A fierce electric guitar is used during the chorus, and the round-robin rap done by them is another catchy technique used to bridge the gap between verses.<br />Still a wonderful album despite the cooling off of the Spice years, this was the apex of their popularity, made all too evident with Geri Halliwell's departure the following year.  And what happens when you leave out Ginger Spice from an album?  Answer:  a lack of flavour in their next album.  Stay tuned.the following year.  And what happens when you leave out Ginger Spice from an album?  Answer:  a lack of flavour in their next album.  Stay tuned.
B000002UUX|5.0|ahhhh megadeth,this was the very first megadeth album i listened to,i was shocked to see that megadeth was formed by ex-metallica guitarist dave mustaine.im a huge megadeth fan and of all the albums this is definitly the best,these tracks are very killer,some of em get dumb in the beginning like hangar 18,lucretia,five magics,poison was the cure,and rustin piece but later during these songs killer riffs come on,the best out of all these songs are hangar 18,holy wars,and tornado of souls.the song rust in piece is very killer the ending riffs are so good i keep listening that part and rewinding to that part over and over again.this is megadeth's best album and i recommend it to anybody that likes metallica,slayer,and anthrax and other thrash.
B00005MKA3|5.0|first off, let us get this straight, there are some differing orders of songs, with different releases, interesting; but it doesn't affect each individual song; but....<br />\\"Wake up and Live ya\\", as another eloquently noted, is the opening of this album (\\"opening clarion call\\"). It sets a tempo for this album, could be very good for the ending too, as this edition we look at has it finishing up the order (before the bonus track). \\"Coming in from the cold\\", plays a similar role on \\"Uprising\\", somehow, a similar message; refrains.<br />Difficult to rank these songs, you have my maybe two favorites then most everything is tied for third; in order of my favorites, because most every song is excellent excepting the likes of say, \\"so much trouble in the world\\" or \\"natty dread rides again (ride natty ride)\\", some may find these songs very likeable, but they miss for me. The latter seeming overdone in concept.<br />One drop, I know Bob's music fairly extensively, this is in my 10 top favorite songs, if not in the top 5.<br />Africa Unite , the instruments and Bob's melodic vocal contributions (not words, the \\"la-la\\" rhythms)  make this A-1 besides it message.<br />Most Memorable; for me, is \\"Top Rankin\\" with one of those clever lines one remembers, mention the album \\"Survival\\" to me, and I think of \\"Top Rankin' Top Rankin' Are You Skankin' (Skankin')\\"<br />Zimbabwe, this is likewise, very memorable to the memory, about what was the former country of Rhodesia.<br />After these songs, all are excellent on an almost equal basis; probably no sense in rehashing what other reviewers have said.
B00009L1OB|4.0|Duran Duran became mega stars after their second album, Rio, became a smash hit worldwide thanks in equal parts to radio friendly songs and glamorous videos.  Their third album, the bizarrely titled Seven &amp; The Ragged Tiger, is again filled with big hooks and hits, but also with a bit more of an edge.  The album's first single, \\"Union Of The Snake\\" is one of their most challenging and experimental songs.  The song has a catchy hook built around a slinky guitar riff and a Moroccan vibe.  There is a jazzy saxophone solo in the break and is flush with synth flourishes that give the song a mysterious and sensual sound.  It peaked at number three on the charts.  \\"New Moon On Monday\\" was the second single and is a straightforward song in the classic new romantic vein.  The band produced a Thriller like, 20-minute video to accompany the song involving some bizarre underground resistance group in France.  It helped propel the song to peak at number ten.  The third single became the band's first US number one, \\"The Reflex\\".  The album version differs from the single, which was remixed, as it doesn't have the female vocals that are some prominent in the single version.  It is still catchy and quite memorable and one can tell upon first listen why it was smash hit.  Other songs have a shiny sound including \\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement\\" and \\"I Take The Dice\\".  The last two songs return the band to the edgier sound that appeared on the last few tracks on their first album.  The haunting instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger\\" segues into the hauntingly beautiful \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" creating two of the finest moments in the band's history.
6305320802|1.0|My distant memories of this film were from the night when Jimmy Carter was elected president...back in the late 70's when you had only the 3 network channels, PBS, and 2 local channels. The networks were covering the election, and this must have been all that was playing because I watched it that night. I was about 13 yrs. old. I definitely remember the opening where Curly is singing \\"Oh, what a beautiful morning\\", and the tune stuck in my head all these years. But I also remember being very aggrivated that all they did was sing and sing and sing and sing, and it was so so so boring!!! Yes, I know it was a musical, but it seemed more like an opera to me. I was 13 mind you, and so as I looked back, I thought perhaps because of my youth and inexposure to good film, I had misjudged this film.<br />Fast forward 29 years or so, to the other night. I have since studied classic film and appreciate it very much. To be honest,I am still not very fond of musicals in general, unless they are good. Meaning, they do some acting and talking too, not just sing, sing, sing, and if the singing fits with the story. Musicals I enjoy are The Sound of Music, some of the Nelson Eddy ones like I Married an Angel (because it is fun and silly!) and The Chocolate Soldier, Elvis' GOOD movies- King Creole and Jailhouse Rock ( I like his songs in his not-so-great Love Me Tender too), White Christmas, and Mary Poppins can be fun every now and then. But other than that, musicals in general do nothing for me because they are too weird. Here in Oklahoma!, well, yes, the photography and color ARE beautiful. But it certainly isn't enough to carry the whole picture. I felt it did have a very good opening, and I do like that song. And the song about the surrey was okay too. But most of the others were just plain silly. And I kept thinking, well can these folks just start talking and acting and quit singing all the time?? Just get on with the story please!!! In the beginning I was interested to see whatthe social was going to be like, but they had to sing and sing and sing, on and on and on and on...that it put me to sleep and I missed the social, the part I was waiting for!! I did wake up again, only to hear MORE singing, and by then it was the same aggrivating experience I had when I was 13 years old. I don't care to watch tap dancing cowboys, or girls who play hard-to-get and thus cause a bunch of trouble. The Laurey character should have just gone with the Curly character to the social instead of using Judd as a token in her little game of playing hard-to-get. The film was so fluffy and lightweight and empty, and what weird turn into darkness it took when Curly and Judd had a chat in the smokehouse. No serious thing could fit in this film. It is like covering a Twinkie, in all its artificial sickeningly sweet fluffiness, with gravy and trying to make it a meal. Yuck!  Nothing of this story ended up being of any interest to me. Well, this is my opinion folks. I know lots of people absolutely adore this film, and that's just fine. But I don't. But still, I will always enjoy listening to Nelson Eddy on my daughter's CD as he sings, \\"Oh, what a beautiful morning...\\"
B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music's albums in the 70's representing the cutting edge of avant-garde pop music.  For their final release, Avalon in 1982, they shift gears towards the soulful sounds that lead singer Bryan Ferry would explore on his solo albums.  As depicted on the album's cover, the band crafts a lush, airy and ethereal sound.  The songs are awash in sophisticated synthesizers and longing guitar riffs.  Mr. Ferry broodingly sings seductive and smart lyrics.  \\"More Than This\\" is one of the most elegant love songs around.  Mr. Ferry sings with longing and heartbreaking weariness and Phil Manzanera's guitar shimmers throughout.  The song is quite simply a masterpiece.  The title track is another elegantly crafted love song that is subtle and beautiful.  \\"While My Heart Is Still Beating\\" has a terse, propulsive beat that literally thumps throughout.  The only problem with Avalon is that is woeful short.  The ten tracks clock in at barely over thirty-five minutes and two (\\"India\\" and \\"Tara\\") are short instrumentals.  That aside, Avalon, set the standard for romantic synth-pop that countless bands in the 80's tried to copy, but could never replicate.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Having been to Tokyo, and working with Japanese people on a regular basis I can tell you this movie is a disgrace and an insult. I'm ashamed.<br />The plot ? there is none. The movie is boring like hell, and only the constant mockery can keep some people amused. Not me.
B00005A8H5|1.0|I liked the soundtrack in the movie...a lot.<BR>I thought the SACD would be a complete remix of the original soundtrack masters. <BR>I was ready for the stunning quality that some of the early classical recordings have been transformed into, for example, the George Szell SACD recordings available here at Amazon.<BR>I was vastly wrong.<BR>The sound quality reminds me of early 45's (if anybody remembers). Just without clicks.<BR>A real waste of an SACD, or even a CD.<BR>I still like the music enough to not throw it away. I'll just never select it as an example of the SACD technology art.

Hyped movies tend to be viewed with unconscious caution.<br />Lost in translation *is* a good movie, a great movie even. But in a quiet kind of way. If you're expecting something from it, you may or may not get it; but if you simply watch it without so many expectations, you'll surely find much more.
B000127LW2|5.0|Season one of Voyager has several excellent episodes.  The show really hit its  stride in seasons four and five but this set was very enjoyable to watch.  I know some people have complained about the packaging and such but, it holds the discs well and takes up little space on the shelf...the cosmetics don't really matter to me.  The content is what is important and I think the cast led by Kate Mulgrew and the stories seemed even more engaging than I remembered.  Hopefully the releases of the remaining seasons will come as promised over the next 9 months.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Set 30 years before the original STAR WARS (Episode IV - A New Hope), Lucas throws us into a mix that includes trade blockades, podraces, and votes of no confidence. Yes, it's Episode I!    The \\"Old Republic\\" elder Kenobi spoke of in the original film is in its heyday - but dark times - they are coming.     The useless Republic Senate caused greedy businesses like the Trade Federation to protest on Naboo, a Republic planet. The Chancellor of the Republic then requested aid from the Jedi Council to restore peace in the Republic. Two Jedi Knights - young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master - are dispatched.    Upon arrival on Naboo - the film's opening scene - the Jedi are attacked by the Trade Federation and escape to rescue Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala. It is then revealed that the Trade Federation are but mere pawns in a bigger game, one that involves the Sith - evil Jedi.    The Jedi flee with Amidala back to the Republic Senate and the Jedi Council for more help. Along the way, they fatefully picked up a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, prophesized as the Chosen One.    To find out the rest of the story, you will just have to watch the film.    \\"Wipe them out - all of them.\\"    The Force Will Be With You...Always    COMING SOON  Star Wars: Clone Wars, Volume Two DVD  Star Wars Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith DVD

B0001907DA|5.0|This is a great box set.  The Police Academy series is my favorote comedy series along with the Naked Gun series, National Lampoons Vacation series, Austin Powers series and the Scary Movie series.  I'm so glad that the sereis is finally on dvd.  The first two may be to bad for kids under 9 but the rest of them are for the family to enjoy.  Of coarse, the first one is in a 20th Anniversary Special Edition.  Police Academy 1,2,3,6 and 7 will be in widescreen and Police Academy 4 and 5 will be in a fullscreen which I think is stupid.  If most of them are in widescreen, why not make them all widescreen.  But what can you do about it.  The first film will have a great commentary to go with it.  The other films will just have a trailer and documentary.<br />Police Academy- This is the best of the series and had me laughing all the way through.  Tackleberry made me laugh like crazy.  \\"DROP THE STERIO, OR I'LL BLOW YOUR DAMN NUTS OFF.\\"  This is a good deal in this box set, and is still a believable movie.   10/10                                                  Rated R for language, adult humor, and nudity.<br />Police Academy 2: Their First Assinment- This is almost as funny as the first and had most of the characters from the first one.  I wonder why George Martini wasn't in anymore of the Police Academy films.  \\"You have the right to sing the blues\\".    9/10                                            Rated PG-13 for language, adult humor, mild violence and brief nudity.<br />Police Academy 3: Back In Training- This is a great, funny and strong entry in the series.  Zed and Sweetchuck are a team in this (but Sweetchuck hates Zed.)  The only part I didn't like was the boring boat chase at the end.  \\"People used to say I was a real jerk, but now I'm a people guy.\\"  This was a funny movie.    9/10                                             Rated PG for mild language, violence, and some crude humor.<br />Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol- This is a funny movie.  In thisone, Harris returns and Proctor is his partner.  Althou this filmisn't the best in the series, it is still funny.  Why wasn't Fackler in this one. \\"Gene, Gene made a machine, Joe Joe made it go, Art Art blew a fart and blew the damn thing apart\\". Get ready to laugh.     8/10<BR>Rated PG for language, crude humor, and some mild violence.<br />Police Academy 5: Assinment Miami Beach- This is another strong entry in the series and is a bit better than number 4.  Harris and Procter steal the show in this one big time.  Too bad Steve Guttenberg didn't make any more. \\"Now I have to kill you, nothing personal\\".      8/10<BR>Rated PG for mild language, humor, and some violence.<br />Police Academy 6: City Under Seige- This is the second best in the series.  Fackler returns, but House is gone.  This has a cool car chase at the end of the film.  It's cool when Jones does Terminator.  \\"Target, HUMAN\\".  So get ready to laugh in this slapstick.         10/10<BR>Rated PG for crude humor, language, and violence.<br />Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow- This is an ok movie but is a bit too slow and not funny.  I guess it's not a terrible movie and is good for a chuckle on a boring Sunday afternoon.  \\"We're in deep borse.\\"            4/10<BR>Rated PG for mild sensuality.<br />So, this is a great box set and most of the movies are hilarious.  Watch out, cause they might be making a 8th Police Academy movie.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This DVD was one of those experiences of getting FAR more than I dreamed of.  Eric Clapton, a lifelong friend of George Harrison organized this concert along with George's wife Olivia and Dhani (who looks like a clone of  the '60's George Harrison). The guest's include of course, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,  Jeff Lynne (ELO), Billy Preston, Ravi Shankar,  Monty Python and many more.  These musicians learned George's music to absolute perfection and gave a two hour performance (at the the DVD version), that is one of the most emotionally moving performances, no make that &quot;the&quot; most emotionally moving performances I have ever seen, as a tribute to the late great George Harrison, whom in my personal estimation was not only a master guitarist who excelled at creating the most melodic leads in the history of music, but also a very loving spiritual man who helped shape the hearts, minds and soul of the generation that grew up in the 60.'s. This tribute literally brought me to tears of joy in appreciation of the music as well as the grief of the loss of someone whom many of us feel as strongly or more so than losing a very dear brother.
0385510438|4.0|Small town Mississippi a few decades back. A secretive gangster family, corrupt politicians and a young widow just trying to get on with her life - until it is rudely terminated in gruesome rape and murder. A young man buys the local newspaper and propels himself into the soul of this yahoo paradise.<br />  The prosecution of the accused is told through the newspaper editor's eyes. Along the way he is befriended by an African-American woman of remarkable character, who becomes the first black woman to serve on a jury.<br />  The story is slow-paced, but thoroughly enjoyable. Several stories run concurrently, all of them seamlessly welded together into an enjoyable whole.<br />  It's not a page-turner, but like a fine wine or good scotch, a book to be taken in leisurely sips. The characters are well developed and interesting people. The plot moves nicely and the ending leaves you questioning whether it's contrived or not. There's doubt because you know for yourself that crazier things have happened.<br />  All in all, a fine read.<br />Jerry
0195117298|3.0|Boy, talk about a difficult book to get through.  I've no doubt that Mr. Barbour knows what he's talking about, but I have to admit that I got thoroughly lost on more than one occasion.  Just when I thought I had the thread of his argument pinned down, he embarked on a new more arcane path, and I was lost again.  I have to admit I am not really a math-physics type person, but I do read a fair amount of literature for amateurs on the topic of theoretical physics, and time is one of those subjects that intrigues me the most.  I'm not quite sure for whom the book is intended either, because although it lost me as a neophyte, I can't imagine that it would hold the attention of someone well grounded and/or professionally involved in physics; it has too many words and too few mathematical formulae.  In all though, I found the concept of time as a, more or less, static collection of instants all shuffled together like playing cards or like the frames of a 35mm film strip a provocative one.  I just can't help feeling, though, that there is something significant missing in the author's argument.  I'm sure he would insist that it is just the overwhelming psychological experience of time &quot;flowing&quot; that is throwing me off, but when I think of his perspective on time and history, I find the only way it makes sense is if I stand outside of the system to see how it might work.  I find it difficult to see how the information about past experiences can be passed on to my memory in any given instant without some sort of connection between all the instants of which &quot;I&quot; am a part.  That however would make consciousness a unique and special entity, which I find difficult to accept.  Although consciousness has sometimes been claimed to be a factor in generating Newtonian reality from quantum &quot;observations,&quot; I think there has been sufficient discussion that refutes it.  Again, I found the book way over my head, but I hope to reread it on another occasion with hope of achieving better understanding.  Definitely not a book to start with if you're not heavily into physics.h hope of achieving better understanding.  Definitely not a book to start with if you're not heavily into physics.
B00012QM8G|4.0|The movie is mainly in black and white, directed with high professionalism and refers to the most serious matter Spielberg ever approached: the Holocaust.<br />Moreover, the Holocaust has been approached from many aspects, mostly with stereotyped ideas (either it did happen or never happened), exaggerated or not, included Gypsies or not ...etc., some authors and historians actually deformed this horrible historical facts, others tried to profit out of it and few told it as it happened.<br />The movie is -most probably- about a real story that it did happen, nothing is unusual in the brutality of war, sadistic soldiers and generals, poor hopeless people killed for their race, color or religion: All where repeated -and still- in every war. Nothing is unusual, also, in Oskar Schindler, this no-saint war profiter who finally turned to be a savior, which is something common in the human race, and which creates the real heroes enlightening the human accumulation of wisdom.<br />Spielberg did a great job, very realistic and brought to cinema the unique movie about the real holocaust that included the corruption of the generals, the madness of the Nazi ideology and the horrible tragedy that Jews (and other 160 million victims) died in it. However, it is not an anti-German film or Holocaust propaganda, it is a precious credit to the cinema and Spielberg (together with his other great masterpiece Empire Of The Sun) reminding us that it is a great art.<br />Do not watch the movie for the Holocaust controversy, and do not watch it because it is for Spielberg, but buy it and view it every time someone is promoting WAR.
0385504209|5.0|An amazing work of fiction.  I have to admit that I rarely read narrative prose, but the love of a good murder mystery is my &quot;guilty secret.&quot; I enjoy the puzzle that this type of fiction poses for the reader, and the more literate the author, the cleverer his design, the more I enjoy the experience.  This one was a rare treat.  Not only does the author present a stylishly crafted crime novel, he also creates a series of cryptic word puzzles based on history that engages of the reader's own knowledge base.  Since I also enjoy history, he definitely had me riveted.  I read the book from cover to cover in a few short hours in one sitting.  While some of the characters were a little two dimensional, and I had already solved the identity of the &quot;villain&quot; well before the end, the author's competent style and the secondary story buried in the Da Vinci code itself, so thoroughly  captivated me that I was not disappointed in the least.  Furthermore, I'm going right out and find out more about the Knights Templar and Mary Magdalene! An amazing book.
B000002C25|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I bought it after Definately Maybe and What's the Story (Morning Glory). It's longer, rougher, and heavier. It's just filled with great songs. The album as a whole may have some weak points, but songs like D'You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Fade In-Out, and of course, Don't Go Away, really make this a must-own. The album is a lot of a certain Oasis style that is unlike What's the Story, so I can see how this might be hit or miss for some people (especially if you want short songs, because the avgerage length here is 6 minutes), but I love it. Great stuff, highly recomended.
B00006JKOL|1.0|>I'm sure that if they don't have Sheet Music in front of them, they don't know what to do with an Instrument<br />In fact, I'm not aware that any \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" sheet music has ever been published. Believe it or not, some us can actually tell precisely what notes and chords, etc., we're listening to without consulting sheet music and could do so long before we entered \\"music school\\". <br />If you'll go back and actually read one of the reviews in question, you'll see that far from being accused of breaking \\"rules\\", Mr. Anderson is being accused of not LISTENING carefully enough. <br />Now, if you merely asseverate that the music \\"sounds good\\" to you, and I merely insist that the music \\"sounds bad\\" to me, neither of us has said anything. It may very well \\"sound good\\" to you, but if you can't articulate why, you simply have no business writing a review. <br />In any case, you have certainly no right or ground to call other reviewers \\"idiots\\" and \\"retarded\\" because they happen to disagree with you.
B00005JMCT|4.0|I am really going to miss the AMERICAN PIE series. This is an excellent movie and is very much underated. It had a very good storyline (especially at the bucks night) and hilarious twists and turns which are guaranteed to make you crack up laughing. The intellegence of the characters(stifler) is also funny.  This movie shows all the pros and cons of a wedding and how to impress the in laws. MUST SEE for anyone who liked any of the other american pie movies or a comedy fan.
B000026OHN|5.0|What these performances show us is that when Bach is played by a master musician, adding almost nothing of himself to the music except the highest taste, technique, and ability to deliniate the lines without utmost clarity, the music that results is spiritually moving in a way that far surpasses the results achieved by a performer who TRIES to be moving by adding his or her own emotions to the performance. Bravo Richter... he never sounded better!
B000059TEP|5.0|This is the best movie ever made. It has a great storyline, great cast. This may seem as a tearjeker for some but if you actually see the movie its hilarious. I have memorised all the scripts and this movie is just one of the excellent movies which are hard to find. It combines happiness, strength, sadness and anger all in one, a kalaeidoscope of emotions. If theres one DVD  youll rent make sure its GHOST
B00005JMEW|5.0|He promised and did it. So, the 4th film by QT starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox. And when I mean starring I really mean it. Goddamn, I would never think fighting girls can be so sexy! Thanks to Uma. Because it is her created character, not Quentin's. Yeah, stylih blonde-killer is damn good. Almost godlike. She could be killed 192 times throughout the movie. But you can't kill the God, a?<br />The other thing is Lucy. After C. A.: full throttle I saw her in my worst nightmares. In Bill she is good, though. But this is Quentin's achievment.<br />Some say movie is awfully bloody. Wrong. While watching it I laughed so loud. And that means 100% Tarantino came back. Killing people have never been as esthetically beautiful as here.<br />Many are disappointed with splitting the movie into volumes. So was I. But if you think you'll realize it is clever. Do you really think you would seat all three hours there? Think not. Goddamn, this is not LOTR!<br />P.S. people, don't read the script of the 2nd volume before watching it, please. It is very bad thing to do.
0446678430|5.0|I was so excited when I first read this book and I am still excited after reading it two years later. It is great to have a book that goes through a personal story and then tells you how you can apply the ideas in your life in many different ways. Robert and Sharon did well with this one. If you want to build a future for yourself outside of the rat race, this book is a must read.
B00006F7S4|2.0|&quot;Sea Change&quot; lacks any kind of energy, and its lyrics would yield only yawns from Mrs. Bumthrust's grade 10 creative writing class. At this point in his career, Beck's music is comparable to old folkies like James Taylor, though his humourless earnestness makes even Taylor seem more fun than a barrel full o' Buzzcocks.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I have never been a huge Blondie fan, but there is no denying that they were very good at what they did and they were versatile too. Their music encompassed pop, rock, punk, disco and even reggae. I never liked punk so some of their hits do not appeal to me but Blondie make up for this with a string of classics. All their UK hits from their peak years are here with the exception of War child, which only just made the top forty, so cannot be called essential. You also get Maria, the song that gave them a number one UK hit in the new millennium. Their American chart history is different, but everything that matters based on the American pop charts can be found here. Indeed, Blondie has always been more popular in Britain than America.<br />My favorites here include Tide is high (a cover of a previously obscure reggae song), Sunday girl, I'm always touched by your presence dear (later covered by singer-comedienne Tracey Ullman), Dreaming, Heart of glass and Hanging on the telephone. These songs are sufficiently appealing to make this a five-star album, but there are some other great songs here too.<br />This is the strongest Blondie compilation yet released. Unless you are a committed fan, this contains everything you'll ever need of their music as a group, although you might still wish to seek out some of Deborah Harry's solo music, none of which is included.
B00005V9IK|5.0|ID4 is a great flick, always fun to watch -- you can turn your brain off with no discomfort. It's important for people to understand how totally this movie is Anime (and Battlestar Galactica) influenced though. From the Southern Cross episodes of Robotech (known in Japan as Southern Cross), in which giant ships appear over Earth cities, to Macross (the 1984 movie -- the explosion of the mother ship is exactly like Bodolza's ship destruction), the film is clearly influenced by by anime. But the creators were also Battlestar Galactica fans, and they seem to have consciously inserted BSG scenes (the death of Serena/the first lady, the &quot;fly the enemy fighter into the big ship&quot; plot at the end). A good movie, though.
B000002J2F|4.0|That's what I like about this CD: they were in the process of coming out of their progressive era, and were just getting their feet wet with the pop style that would make them famous in the 1980s. <br />When Steve Hackett, their marvelous guitarist, left after 1977, it took the remaining trio a little time to recover, which explains why their subsequent release, &quot;And Then There Were 3&quot; was so mediocre (though it had its moments). <br />But then came Duke. What a great album! The opening 3 numbers show them at their best, especially Tony Banks' keyboards. The fast-moving, upbeat &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; blends right into the next number, &quot;Duchess,&quot; which starts off slow and melancholy, but then gets going. The opening trio of songs is closed out with a beautiful Collins vocal &quot;Guide Vocal.&quot; <br />Next are 7 very good Genesis songs which show some very good range, from the guitar-driven &quot;Man Of Our Times,&quot; to the catchy single &quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; to the soft-sounding &quot;Please Don't Ask.&quot; But what really stands out is &quot;Turn It On Again.&quot; All by itself, this song captures the prog-rock Genesis was coming out of, as well as the pop era they were just starting to enter. It's little wonder that this song has long been a favorite of all Genesis fans, even some from the Peter Gabriel years. <br />The CD ends with a final tribute to their progressive era, with &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and &quot;Duke's End.&quot; Keyboardist Tony Banks is at his best here, with his wide range of talents on full display. Phil Collins likewise showed some very strong drum-work here. <br />Only two things I don't like: first, Tony's keyboards and Phil's drums leave Mike's guitars in the dust. For earlier fans, Hackett's absence is glaring on this album. This is not to suggest Mike is a bad guitarist; it's just like having Ted Danson as your lead actor when you could have had Harrison Ford.<br />Second, the beginning and closing songs work very well together, but the 7 middle songs really aren't united in any way. Okay, I'm being nit-picky, but seriously, if they'd used a little more creativity, this could have been a great concept album all the way through. For these two reasons alone, it gets 4 stars instead of 5.<br />All in all, it's still a very good work, and it rightfully deserves its place alongside the best this band has to offer.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Universal deserves to be punished for this. This DVD forces you watch about 5 minutes of previews, WITHOUT the ability to skip past them. Patently dishonest on the part of the studio, especially since the previews were for some sexy movies, that I wouldn't normally want my son to see. AND THEN I see that there are no English subtitles in the disc, so that my wife, who is Japanese, had to go without understanding the movie. FINALLY, there was something wrong with the audio. I had to turn the volume up to the highest level on the TV to hear most of the dialogue. I will punish Universal by avoiding their next few titles.
B000002J1O|5.0|For Phil Collins-era Genesis fans who are discovering that their favorite band had a previous incarnation, with Peter Gabriel on vocals, this is the album for you. <br />Not as long and attention-demanding as &quot;Lamb,&quot; and not as weird as &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme,&quot; this one shows the early Genesis at their best. A little eccentric at times, it will shock you if you're expecting cutesy pop songs like the ones on &quot;Invisible Touch.&quot; <br />It takes a little getting used to; it took me a listen or 2 before I was finally able to get into it, but once I did, it became one of my all-time favorite albums. The main reason is because the musicianship is of a very high order: Tony Banks shows himself to be a master keyboardist; Steve Hackett is arguably the most underrated, underappreciated guitarist of all time (listen to him here, and then catch his classical-oriented, solo CD &quot;Bay of Kings&quot;, and you'll see what I mean); Mike Rutherford is much better suited on bass as he ishere, than when he played lead guitar after Hackett's departure in 1977; and Phil Collins is one of the best drummers in rock and roll history. (No, that's not flattery. His commerical success as a singer greatly overshadows the fact that he is a masterful drummer.)<br />Last but not least, Peter Gabriel shows off his song-writing talents that were only beginning to bud here, but later made him a legend in his own right. <br />All of the songs are solid, but in my opinion the best is &quot;Firth of Fifth.&quot; It starts out with a beautiful Banks piano composition, and then into some poetic Gabriel lyrics. Following is a 3-4 minute section where the band's musical talents are on full display--especially Hackett's guitar, Banks' keyboards, and Collins' drums. <br />Again, if you love the 1980s Genesis and Peter Gabriel, and want to know more about what they were like together, this CD is the best place to start.
0385504209|1.0|The book is what I would categorize as an *easy read*.  I sailed thru it in no time.  So many had told me the ending was a &quot;shocker&quot;.  I agree, it was a shocker, only because I was shocked that I had figured the whole thing out by the middle of the book.  I felt the plot sophomoric. I found the history interesting and the interpretations fun, but in the long run I would not recommend the book to anyone who likes a good mystery that is tough to figure out, cuz this ain't it!  I will agree that it is an engaging book and it is difficult to put down once you begin, but in the end it was a let down.
B000060P79|1.0|that should have been the title anyway. yep sorry to break it to all of you MTV and TRL haters but here's a new band filled with rich pretty-boy skaters. and needless to say the cheerleaders already adore them and are currently sporting their pictures on their folders and on the walls in their rooms. these guys have instantly become the topic of slumber parties filled with 13-14 year old girls who apply their lip gloss carefully so as to attract those skater preps with bleached blond spiked hair.sound familiar? yeah the same thing pretty much happened when blink 182(they suck too) came out. then again with sum 41(they also suck). and yet again with good charlotte(who also suck).and now its happening all over again with yellowcard,mest,new found glory (and yes these guys all suck too.) but now we have another band that sucks and they're called a simple plan. and yeah you guessed it they give us an album filled with crybaby lyrics about breaking up with your girlfriend and how much their parents hate them. oh please spare me the pain. i dont think ive ever heard rich preps whine so much. why do you guys cry about losing a girl when you know any there is some other airhead chick waiting to take her place?oh and to all you people that say its the music that counts, well then how do you explain all the giggly pre-teen girls,when asked why they like the band,giggle and say &quot;because the lead singer's hot&quot; oh yeah the music counts alright. im sure those girls really came to hear the music. (im being sarcastic.) man i'd love to see the faces of preps and cheerleaders everywhere when i play some rock and/or metal. they just wouldn't get it.(oh and ill nino and linkin park dont count as metal)i once had Morbid Angel-Altars of Madness(great metal album) playing rather loud on my CD player in class and all the skaters and cheerleaders looked about ready to cry and throw the Bible at me. oh and to all you dumb f*cks that call metalheads satanic there's a song on this simple plan album called god must hate me. sure there's a nice chrisitan song your parents would approve of. im sure God must really like that song.f*cking retards.<br />oh and one more thing. in a recent interview these guys insulted kurt cobain(R.I.P.)! they said and i quote &quot;as a guitarist kurt cobain is just okay.&quot; well guess what guys,kurt could have played circles around you with his eyes closed.just because you guys tried to play a nirvana song and quit because it was too complex for you doesn't mean he's not good, it just means you guys suck c*ck. <br />you thinking of buying a good CD? get Master of Puppets(Metallica) Ultimate Sin(Ozzy Osbourne) Coma of Souls(Kreator) Terminal Spirit Disease(At the Gates)Fabulous Disaster(Exodus) Practice What You Preach(Testament) or Somwhere in Time(Iron Maiden). if you are a teenage girl,jock,or a skater prep, then stay away from rock/metal and stick to this simple plan garbage because rock/metal would make you piss in your pants that you bought at Hot Topic,Beach Access,and/or Tilly's.as if you couldn't afford another pair anyway.
0804106304|1.0|The Joy Luck Club is a work that accomplishes what it sets out to do...reinforce the negative stereotypes that exist against Asian Americans.  While Amy Tan goes on to tell 4 telling stories of tragedy and sacrifice, she falls back onto the same Western clichés that dominate Western impressions of Asian culture.  <br />Amy Tan shows Asian culture as a cruel place full of philandering and abusive men. <BR>It's a real shame.  Amy Tan could have been are real innovator by showing non-asians a view of Asian society and the Asian American experience.  She could have shown that you could be an American and be Asian at the same time.  Instead, she re-enforces the stereotypes of Asian society and strengthens the belief that the only way to find true happiness is to remain silent, blame your culture for all that's wrong, and marry up and into acceptance.  <br />In summation, I encourage all people to be people of substance.  If you really wish to learn about other cultures, don't find your education in the pages of fiction like this.  Talk to people, go out and experience it first hand.  Research it on the internet.  Don't be the mindless flock who accept everything that spoon-fed to them by the media.  Don't believe that Amy Tan's writing represent the typical experience of the Asian American.  There are many within the Asian community that feels betrayed by Amy Tan.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|A near miss that has been sold with loads of hype. Bill Murray does some good work but it is really nothing that he has not done before. The depictions of some of the characters have a meanness to them that will put me off from watching it again let alone owning a copy of it. I feel that a second viewing would not be entertaining. R.E. and his peers must must have seen some other cut of this movie.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's &quot;Stripped&quot; album is definately one of the best CD's to come out in 2003.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I really love the diversity of this album. It's a great mix of producers and writers ranging from The Neptunes to her longtime collaborator Max Martin who is what made Britney her signature sound. It's a nice transition from teen pop idol to dance diva.  The songs are great and bouncy and there's only one lone ballad here written by Dido the single &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; which has a great message. I also love &quot;Let Me Be&quot; produced by &quot;DarkChild&quot; as well as the remake of &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll.&quot; &quot;Britney&quot; uses her own voice as the chorus unlike &quot;Oops...I Did It Again.&quot;  Other highlights are the disco style &quot;Anticipating&quot; and the hit &quot;Overprotected&quot; even though I wish they had a bonus track of the raido version remix by DarkChild.  While Britney hasn't had a album worthy of 5 whole stars yet &quot;Britney&quot; is her breaking point from teen pop. I thought &quot;In The Zone&quot; would be much better than it was but overall &quot;Britney&quot; is still in my book her best album.
B00008PC2O|3.0|T2 is an excellent movie.  The effects, the acting, etc.  The thing i didn't like about T2 was that it didn't have the same suspensful feeling as the first one.  I saw the first one as a little kid, and the red eyeball scared the hell outta me, especially because Arnold had half of his face ripped off.  T2 was definetly a better movie in terms of special effects.  But it didn't have as good of a story line to it.  I also didn't like Linda Hamilton's acting in it.  She's too tough and mannish.
B00004SCX6|5.0|While the &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; album mainly focused on her vocals, &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; focuses more on catchy tunes and overproduced choruses.  I love every song on this album from &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot; to the country-ish hit &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; (written by Shania Twain).  My other favorites are &quot;One Kiss From You&quot; and &quot;Can't Make You Love Me.&quot;  Even though the choruses in this album get annoying the songs are well-crafted and catchy. The ballads like &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; and &quot;Dear Diary&quot; are good and showcase her voice.  Diane Warren wrote the midtempo song &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot; which is kind of so-so. Anyways if you loved the singles from &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot; then I really reccomend the same-titled album which is not just a good single with all filler. I think some of the songs like &quot;What U see (Is What U Get)&quot; could've been singles.  Also included like all Britney albums is the remake of The Rolling Stone's hit &quot;Satisfaction&quot; which sounds really cool the way she and Max Martin made it.  This album definately has a Max Martin sound and is very teenybopper. I still love it though and would reccomend it to any pop music fan.
B000002HJD|1.0|God-awful pseudo-poetry by rock's most over-rated lyricist.  The fact that this Rimbaud-wannabe's spoken tripe is considered &quot;poetry&quot; by so many people is testament to the moronization of American culture.  Buy &amp; read some Keats, Blake, Browning...
B00000099Y|5.0|There are not words to express the genius and perfection of this musical masterpiece. Eulogy one of the best songs of all time along with Stinkfist, Aenima, and Hooker set the table for this great CD. Truly a revolutionary album with lyrics and guitar riffs that have never been produced before. Still 7 years after it's release it remains one of the most complex and revolutionary works of modern rock music. It may take more than one listen to catch on to some of the material but it is a Awesome CD.
0385504209|1.0|I guess people either love this book or hate it. Count me in the latter group. It starts out very promising, but quickly goes awry after the two main characters leave the museum. I agree with the reviewer who said it was a big slam on Christianity and the Catholic church. But, religion aside, it's not a very well written book. The characters are one dimensional. The plot is ridiculous. The end of each chapter left us dangling like a daytime soap opera. I agree with one reviewer who wrote that is reads like a movie script turned into a book. I could guess the ending by the middle of the book. I kept hoping the characters would get caught to avoid another chase scene, and end the book! When two &quot;specialists&quot; with advanced degrees couldn't figure out that the backwords writing was just that and not another language, I was ready to give up reading. And, while the book describes some interesting theories, it also quickly leaps beyond the facts into complete conjecture. The problem is that many people believe that all of the information in this book is factual and based on &quot;extensive research&quot;. Just look at the complimentary reviews. That's the big danger in this book--peole who are ignorant and/or gullible about Christianity and its history are falling for this. Again, even if you take the religious aspect out, it's still not a very good suspense/thriller when you can guess the ending so early on in the book.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Rented the video tape ... bought two DVDs of TITANIC and LOVED it.  Leonardo DiCaprio was marvelous as was Billy Zane and the rest of the male cast.  The females were too wooden and stereotypical however; Kate Winslow was either sniveling over mean old Cal or drooling over Jack (who can blame her? and NO I am NOT a teenager )... Francis Fisher was the cardboard snot and Kathy Bates a buffoonish and fictional Molly Brown.  The photography and special effects were beautifully rendered and the storyline was clean and clear.  The love story was pure Romeo and Juliet with a touch of modern feelings to it.  The tragedy at the end will be hard for some to take post 9-11: unlike Star Wars, Star Trek , Lord or the Rings et al not only the \\"bad\\" guys die and the violence is not comic book : real people good and bad die horrible deaths.  But it is an excellent film and I went into it not wanting to like it.  I LOVE this film : had you guessed?      BUT  as far as the new DVD Ultimate collection is concerned  This film was good as a story but lousy as FACT.  Mr Cameron has the usual Leftist idea that if Reality and his plastic wishes collide Reality loses. It doesn't.  Further, his comments on social mores (in light of his lack of contribution to the betterment of the world as a whole) is funny.  Also funny was \\"Clint the Cool Guy\\" (he thinks) who said for some strange reason that this flick shows that the Moral Beliefts are \\"Religious type\\" (ie Christians) are false or \\"convenient\\"... eh??  Christians did not make this film Clint, nor star in it.  You silly comments show constipation not competence as a film critic.  Still, have a nice day.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Metropolis was directed by Fritz Lang and, as a black and white silent film from 1927, had HUGE impacts on filmmakers for decades to come. The tale was of a large city with two classes. There was the elite class that lived above ground, enjoying the fresh air and gardens. Then there was the working class that lived in tightly-packed apartment buildings below ground.  You can find this same theme in hundreds of movies afterwards that were influenced by Metropolis.<br />What's amazing is that the movie was lost for pretty much the entire time between its release and 2003. Viewers in those years had to make do with bits and pieces of the movie, often with giant gaps in the storyline. This re-release is the result of years of work, where film historians painstakingly went through all sources they could find and cobbled together a version complete with storyboards where gaps were large. For the first time in almost 80 years, viewers can get a sense of what the original story was all about.<br />The musical score is great, and the storyline is classic. The young man of the elite class falls in love with the young worker woman. There is great strife as the boy's family tries to keep them apart and keep the workers down. The workers believe in prophecies that say they will find a way out of their desolation. The elite believe that their 'golden rule' will last forever. In the middle, a mad scientist believes he has created a robotic woman to keep him happy without any need of human interaction.<br />There are some minor gripes even with this restored version - the motion is often speeded up, when all notes of the original story indicate that the director deliberately made scenes go slowly to give them importance. This is a German movie, but everything has been done in English so you can't really appreciate its true roots. But even so, this is a stellar achievement and one that can be built on going forward. Kudos so the restoration team!
B000002J0B|4.0|It borders on criminal when something is billed as a &quot;Remaster&quot; of a certain album and then they leave songs from the original off. On this disappointing CD the title track &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is missing. What's up with that Jimmy?The WHOLE album would be rated five stars... but since its missing a song, I'll give it four. Seems the song &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; migrated to the next, albeit weaker, Led Zep offering &quot;Physical Graffiti.&quot; I can see why as PG is ponderous, repetitious, and should have been a single LP when it came out instead of a double.The COMPLETE album (which this remaster is NOT) &quot;House of the Holy&quot; is Led Zeppelin's pinnacle... their best. It was all downhill after this baby.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This amazingly powerful film tells of a war profiteer in WW2 who turns into a savior of Jews. Liam Neeson plays the title Oskar Schindler, a Nazi party member who makes great money using the slave labor during World War II. Little by little he realizes just what he is wrapped up in, and he risks his life and fortune to start saving the Jewish people. By the end, he has rescued over 1,000 Jews.<br />The movie won numerous awards even though Spielberg risked his modern audience by shooting the film mostly in black and white. He in fact won Best Picture of 1993. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley was great as Itzhak Stern. There are so many great performances in the movie that it's almost a shame to call a few out.<br />Even with the black and white colors, you immediately get immersed in this story. I know many people who lived through Poland and Germany in World War II and the attention to detail is just immense. Many, many people that I talk with came out of this movie viewing in tears. It is not a 'historical' movie. It's a movie about real people, in a real situation, and the very difficult choices they had to make. It is about taking the difficult road that you know is right, rather than coasting along the easy road.<br />I really recommend this as a must-watch to any person over age 13. If a youngster is to watch this one, I recommend watching it with an adult so the issues can be talked about afterwards.
B000002JSN|3.0|Ponderous, repetitious, and overly long (should have been one LP instead of two when originally released), &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; even had to have the title song swiped from the previous (and far superior) album &quot;House of the Holy&quot; added to this morass to make it more palatable.The well was running dry for Plant and Page when this album was spawned, and it was to be downhill into medicority after this.Led Zeppelin made some great albums, but this isn't one of them.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is a classic submarine movie of WW2 starring J&uuml;rgen Prochnow. Its title in English is simply The Boat.<br />The movie was originally six separate parts of 45 minutes each, a long mini-series. Even the shorter version has immense power, though, as it tells its tale. You start with a fresh crew of sailors, eager to be out on an exciting mission in a submarine. The sub is full of food, the crew is full of good cheer, and everybody is optomistic.<br />Over time, the crew settles into a routine. The food gets old and mouldy. The sicknesses set in. Being in cramped quarters with the same group of people starts to grate on nerves. And blowing up the enemy is no longer so much fun when you realize the nasty perils of war on the seas - of the long, slow death of drowning.<br />The crew tests its skills to every limit - plunging to unheard of depths as the ship threatens to implode on them, going to the ends of the earth. Soon the crew can think of nothing but getting back to a safe harbor, but there is yet more asked of them.<br />Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant as the captain of this sub, trying to keep his crew together and fulfill his mission. Wolfgang Peterson is brilliant as a director, really drawing you into this world that few people have experienced, building up the claustrophibia and pressure and close-contact situation until you can truly believe in it.<br />While some movies build excitement with violent bloody scenes and gigantic car chases, Das Boot does it in a far more meaningful way - with intense pressure and situations that you can really relate to. There aren't gigantic aliens drooling slime here. There are men trapped in a sub, thousands of feet beneath the surface of the water, and the only air they have to breathe is the air in the tiny metal container they live in.<br />It really makes you appreciate being up in the world, able to walk down the street, able to breathe fresh air. We should all give a tip of our hats to the sailors and submariners of the world, and the things they go through. The Germans were not &quot;the enemies&quot; here - they were just soldiers, doing their duty, and hoping to get home alive in the end.iners of the world, and the things they go through.

B00008J4P5|5.0|In this age of over-production and preciousness in rock music, this is the most refreshing album I've heard in years.  The self-irony of the band makes this masterpiece stand out above most everything else out there.
B0000524CY|5.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" has never seemed like a horror film, unlike \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" or \\"The Omen\\" and makes it a very difficult film to come to grips with. It is, possibly, one of the most demanding and disturbing films ever produced both on a visual and thematic level. The story, as everyone knows by now, concerns  the demonic possession of a young girl (Linda Blair), living with her actress mother (Ellen Burstyn) in Georgtown U.S.A, and of the her eventual rescue through the  efforts of two Catholic Priests, Fathers Merrin (Max Von Syndow) and Karras (Jason Miller). The narrative is so matter of factly executed, that we, as the audience, have no problem with what we are being asked to accept, and, despite the famous special effects and shock pieces, it is this confrontation with the supernatural, and the unquestioned plausibility in the film's execution,   that leaves us totally stunned and drained at the conclusion.  I must admit that this restored version is much clearer than the original.  This time around the movie takes it's time, which makes the descent into darkness much more effective. There is more depth on this ocassion - the agony of the mother, the doubt and inner turmoil of Karras, and the serene and hugely heroic Merrin. I also was thankful to see more of the late Lee J.Cobb in what must be one of his greatest characterisations as Detective Kinderman, something which George C.Scott could never hope to imitate, becasue it remains a defined role for all time.   This is a Catholic movie- the ritual exorcisim is verbatim and the movie examines spiritual problems, both in and outside the Seminary where some of it is shot. Upon it's initial release the majority of movie goers thought that the devil actually won the battle, which both Blatty and Friedkin admitted shocked them at the time. The overwhelming image that strikes one at the conclusion is the scene where Regan, now fred from possession embraces Father Dyer.  There is a close up of Dyer's collar, and eventhough Regan doesn't remember any of it, the significance is shattering and moving. The character of Fr Dyer along with the other priests in the film are  portrayed by real life Jesuits, to whom Blatty dedicated the book. The original excised scenes between Merrin and Karras are put back, especially the scene on the stairs, and a sequence where Merrin recites the rosary. The initial medical diagnosis makes the things that follow more comprehensible , and the scene where Karras listens to Regan on a tape she has made for her Father is quite moving. Jason Miller still shines in the role of Karras, the priest with all the doubts and anguish, but who finally finds his faith again at the expense of his own life.  I don't think there has ever been a performance quite like it, and think Miller should have had a bigger career in Hollywood. There are no phoney performances in the film, and acting honours go to all.  It's the kind of film that you can't single anyone out as, as an ensemble, the actors are all locked together in one ultimate goal or pursuit. \\"The Exorcist\\" will affect anyone that sees it but people of the Catholic faith more than any other. Suddenly we are not so sophisticated after all, and the film has a way of saying that maybe the precepts of fire and brimstone are not so far fetched after all.  It has an unsettling way of answering people who profess to believe in a God who is all loving, but not one who would consign us to hell just as easily.  That would imply that we can't pay lip service to our faith and that there are certain rules to be followed as best we can, and just like the laws of our society, if we break them, we pay a price. \\"The Exorcist \\" says that all the old stories of the Old Testament are not necessarily parables after all. Indeed, the Catholic Church still retains and ordains her priests with the holy order of exorcist, which is the third minor order. There have been reviewers who have said they found the picture absurd and laughable, but I would think in the back of their minds their humour is half heared.  Watching \\"The Exorcist - The Version You've Never Seen\\" is no laughing matter, not when one brings intellect to bare on the subject.  It's always interesting to see Syndow in this role and compare it to the role of Jesus he portrayed in \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\". One thinks of an aged Peter Cushing, crucifix in hand. Indeed, Cushing himself stated that he could never have portrayed a part in the movie as \\"it was too like reality\\"  He always viewed his films as fantasy or dark fairy tales. If I had one quip to make it would have been the spider walk sequence, which seems out of place and breaks the concentration slightly, but otherwise it is as close as they come to a masterpiece, of terror, of darkness, but of the triumph of universal light over that dark. When compared with other William Friedkin films the gritty realisim is there, but \\"The Exorcist\\" will always stand alone from them, like a lonely but strangely noble figure, even though \\"French Connection\\", \\"Crusing\\" and \\"To Live and Die in LA\\", are just as matter of fact and treat their subjects with just as much sincerity. The complete version does say a lot more, but in a subtle way and the fact that it is 31 years old and still is the most provocative films ever, when all the movies once labelled \\"infamous\\" have led us to wonder what all the fuss was about, puts \\"The Exorcist\\" in the front rank of truely original movies, and one that will never lose it's power and effect. In that sense, it says something about mankind as we enter the 21st century.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I've never seen Murray in a film that was as poorly suited to his talent, perhaps because he is so comfortable with comedy. This sad movie was made sadder by the parody of the wasteful days people will spend trying to make money. His noble gestures with the young wife were somewhat unbelievable, and were made all the more admirable because of it. Both of their efforts to prevent getting together, however, left the viewer all the more interested in seeing that happen, since it appeared to be what might have made both of them feel connected to life. Although the sources of their anxiety was different, both suffered from the detachment that people often feel when they seek each other out in territory that is not quite familiar to them. It's sweet that they were able to become friends, but the audience wanted more. Had Murray used his energy (that wasn't displayed) to enjoy her company, and teach her to enjoy herself without having sex, it might have been the solution to the despair they both felt trapped in the situations they perceived, probably accurately, they were in. Obviously, as the more experienced person, that would have been more appropriate for Mr. Murray than for the inexperienced young woman. It surely wouldn't be realistic to have to come from her since she was not in the \\"preferential position\\" he had on location; besides, older men should expect to lead in such a situation, rather than to be \\"entertained.\\" Elders generally have the responsibility for setting both the pace and the level of appropriate engagement. While he did tackle that problem, it was not without prompting, and considerable reservation on his part, almost as if it was so little value to him that it wasn't worth his time or effort. This is not exactly the ideal method of retaining \\"fan power\\" although she exhibited that initially until he came so morose that they were left with nothing more than peripheral observations that substituted for connection. Murray is capable of more, and hasin the past given more to his artwork. Perhaps the right film hasn't come along, or perhaps he was somewhat burned out, as in jet lag. It was a disappointing performance, but could have been attributed to the strange \\"twists\\" of the film, a new female director's first try, I heard. That't too bad.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think this album is brilliant. It's got everything... callaborations, catchy melodies, meaningful lyrics (unlike Britney Spears who just sings about guys and doing it). In my opinion this album let's us see what Christina is all about.It also shows us how much Christina has grown up in the past few years. My fav songs are Soar, Fighter, Dirrty and Can't Hold Us Down. If you like Christina and you dont have this album, I strongly urge you to go out and buy it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|After hearing Gavin for the first time, I was speechless! His voice has a sort of raspy, sexy quality to it, that is very seldom heard.  His songs touch you to the very core, and stay with you all day long.  He is an amazing performer as well, and I would suggest that after you buy the CD, which you will imediately become addicted to, you attend a live performance. It will be one you will never forget!
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence, hmm yes they have talent. Fallen shows some of that but this CD just diddn't satisfy me. Alot of the songs got repetitive and sounded way to familar. There are a few songs that are catchy, but of course they have already been made into singles. Amy's voice does stand out on My Immortal, but other than that the music starts to fall under the synthesized rock category. Somebody said them slightly resembling Metallica? Not at all. Linkin Park? Hardly. But her voice does stand out so I feel they have potential in the future. Id say get a better producer and maybe mixer. Overall Fallen is OK not great but not bad.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Lost is the keyword for this movie: Lost money for buying the DVD, Lost time for watching it, and Lost on all the hype surrounding it.  Much of the hype is that it was low-budget film (by current Hollywood stardards).  After the first 20 minutes of the movie it showed.  I love Bill Murray, and really wanted to like this movie, but the effort it would take to find one reason to like it would be more Lost time.
B00008OWZC|3.0|The cd set is good but it does`nt catch the real feel off the time the songs came out.I`ve seen Led Zeppelin many times live,at rock festives,at concerts.When Led Zeppelin frist came out they were raw and powerfull,there music really touched you.<BR>This CD the music is rushed and the rawness is`nt there.Robert Plants voice which is always good,does`nt show that rough and raw sound.Jimmy Page`s playing is so much better than this cd shows.If`ve I was wantting to really hear the real sound of this band I`d go out and buy the cd of the older stuff or go out and buy the newer 2pc.dvd which has about 5.5 hours of real life concerts and I think you`ll see what I Mean.Led Zeppelin took me though my younger days and I still think there one of the best bands that made rock great.An old rock head from Seattle
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is, by far, Kenneth Branagh's greatest performance in a feature film, and the rest of the cast is superb!!  But I can only ask when Mr. Branagh is going to push this great work onto DVD for a new generation of fans and, just as important, when he might tackle Lear or Macbeth in the future as a film project.  Let us hope that he doesn't relegate himself to Potter sequels and the like, although his performance in the HBO film \\"Conspiracy\\" was superb.  All fans of this film should vote for this to be committed to DVD ASAP!!
B000001GPX|5.0|Yet another review for Beethoven's 5th and 7th conducted by Carlos Kleiber.  Well here's my take on these performance.  This is probably the only 1st movement of the 5th symphony I've heard done properly.  If the conductor doesn't get the dit-dit-dit-duh portion exactly right then it just doesn't work.  Here Kleiber gives the impression that indeed fate is knocking on the door and fate isn't taking no for an answer.  I have Karajan's '63 performance and that version sounds more like musician's playing instruments vs. fate knocking on your door.  The dance-like fugue of the 3rd movement is extremely Bach-sounding.  It also shows Kleiber's masterful control of the orchestra.  Kleiber builds up to the climax of the 4th movement superbly.  The sky becomes clear and victory is finally here.  The reviewer who claims that Kleiber is &quot;hiding behind orchestral polish&quot; is wrong.  Kleiber conducts a 1st class orchestra superbly.  Kleiber is not just making the music a spectacle for himself and the performers but just letting the music speak for itself.  Kleiber shows us Beethoven's fearsome, resilient, joyous, and victorious personality which is exactly what a good conductor does.  5 stars.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Guitar-Too good<BR>Vocals-Moving<BR>Bass-Great<BR>Drums-Yeah theyre great too<br />I first listened to a song by A7X from Madden 2004.  I then got some more of their music from their site and i was hooked.  This is the first harcore band ive listen to besides underoath and I just couldnt stop listening.  I went out and got the cd and read the lyrics and i was further amazed.  The lyrics were complex and extremely artistic.  I wont see you tonight sort of sounded like an emo song to me but when i read the lyrics i learned it was about suicide.  OVerall the cd and the band are one of the best ive ever heard.  BUY THIS CD NOW!!
0060528737|5.0|Yes-it even beats out Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings* for me. I know that most of you will disagree with that statement, but I feel that in key ways, these books are better.<br />Like character growth, or actually development-in LOTR, there is little to none. In these books, there is plenty. We really get to know Lirael, Sam, Mogget, and the Dog. I ESPECIALLY love Sam and Mogget. I pretty much just fell in love with Sam-he seems like he's really a cool person. But Mogget MIGHT just be my favorite of all, and I'm glad that Nix put him in the book a lot. He provides much of the comic relief in the book.<br />In my opinion, this is MUCH easier to read, follow along with, and understand than LOTR. I really didn't want it to end! Don't get mr wrong-LOTR is something I will NEVER forget-Tolkien is TRULY amazing. But, sometimes he is a little hard to read, and I get distracted. Not so with Nix. Everything just flows together so...peacefully.<br />If you're looking for something that you will never forget, and want to come back to again and again, than I think these are the books for you.
B00007JVBI|4.0|I don't usually buy CDs but I had to get this album. It's my first one of Cat Power. Fell in love with &quot;He War&quot; (she raps), &quot;Maybe Not&quot; and &quot;I don't blame you&quot;. I really like &quot;Shaking Paper&quot;  and &quot;Free&quot; as well. (basically most of the album) Those are the really excellent songs....there are a few less favorable but having those excellent songs is priceless. Her guitar riffs, piano keys and soft, extended cries go extremely well with D.G.'s drums. It's definately mellow for moody people like me. Her voice is so rich and earthy. She's the perfect friend to listen to and my fave woman-singer.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|alica keys is talented and a good piano player. her song you don't know my name was good. but the best song was if i ani't got you. anyway, this album was better than her last. so buy it now!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I WAS NEVER A CHRISTINA AGUILERA FAN UNTIL I BOUGHT THIS CD. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CD OF THE YEAR, AND DESERVED MORE PRAISE THAN IT GOT. THE LISTENER ACTUALLY GETS A REAL PICTURE OF WHAT SHE FEELS ABOUT THINGS (LOVE, RELATIONSHIPS, ETC). UNLIKE OTHER FEMALE POPSTARS (COUGH, COUGH, BRITNEY SPEARS), THIS CD ACTUALLY HAS SUBSTANCE & MEANING. & SHE DOESN'T USE COMPUTERS TO DRASTICALLY ENHANCE HER VOCALS LIKE OTHER FEMALES DO. THERE ARE A FEW TRACKS (IF YOU CAN'T BUY THE CD) THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST GET OFF iTUNES OR WHATEVER.<br />KEEP ON SINGIN` MY SONG - SHOWS OFF HER INCREDIBLE RANGE. IT IS KIND OF LONG, BUT THE SONG HAS A GREAT MESSAGE.<br />SOAR - SIMILAR TO KEEP ON SINGIN` MY SONG (A LITTLE SLOW & MELLOW), IT SHOWS HER GREAT VOCAL SKILLS. IT'S A SONG ABOUT EMPOWERMENT & SHE SOUNDS GREAT SINGING IT.<br />GET MINE, GET YOURS - A SONG ABOUT CASUAL SEX, CHRISTINA STILL FINDS A WAY TO MAKE A RISQUE SUBJECT CLASSY. <br />UNDERAPPRECIATED - A GREAT SONG TO SING ALONG TO, BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED IT.<br />INFATUATION - HAS A LATIN FEEL TO IT, & TALKS ABOUT CHRISTINA FALLING IN LOVE WITH A PUERTO RICAN GUY. IT'S A FUN SONG TO DANCE TO. <br />LOVING ME 4 ME - A MID TEMPO SONG WITH A JAZZ FEEL TO IT. SHE'S NOT ABOUT SHOUTING LIKE SHE DOES IN OTHER SONGS, ITS MORE OF A CALM & BLUES TYPE SONG.
B00008WT5C|2.0|Sorry, I am going to disagree with the masses here.  Just because an album is loud does not make it good.  AC/DC would write more melody driven songs on Highway To Hell and Back In Black.  This release just sounds way too similar from track to track with little in terms of compelling hooks.<br />The highlight of this recording is clearly the last track, Whole Lotta Rosie.  Excellent guitar riffs and solos by the Young boys and Bon Scott gives a superb vocal performance.  Let There Be Rock, Problem Child and Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be are decent tunes as well.  However, the rest just doesnot distinguish itself.<br />In others words, pass on this batch and go for Back In Black or Highway To Hell instead.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|How can you not own this album? It is CLASSIC, inspiration for 99% of all artists around. However, the &quot;bonus tracks&quot;, in my mind, make a classic CD worse. They are not necessary. It's nice to see the CD remastered, but the interviews &amp; demos aren't needed. My only other complaint with the CD would be that it only has 9 songs. I wish it had more. <BR>Best songs on the CD:<BR>- P.Y.T : a fun mid-tempo song that was never a big hit, but should have been.<BR>- Baby Be Mine : another song that deserved to be a hit. it's a little slower paced, which is a turnoff. but no one does ballads quite like michael.<BR>- Beat It : Classic. The video was even better than the song itself. <br />Worst Song: Lady in my Life. Each album has a weak link, this song is Thriller's. But overall, this CD is a MUST BUY! IT WILL ALWAYS BE A CLASSIC.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This was one of the many movies I went to see out of sheer boredom- not because I saw the ads and said to myself \\"Wow!  I have to see that one!\\"  Surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the funniest (new) films I've seen in a number of years.  I'm not a particular fan of Ben Stiller's movies (though I always like the man himself).  There wasn't much to laugh about in \\"There's Something About Mary\\" or \\"Meet the Parents\\", but Stiller's portrayal of Derek Zoolander, dim-witted male model, (along with a number of other roles) had me practically rolling on the floor with laughter.  His dialogue and comic timing are perfectly fitted to the character, and his feigned accent is just icing on the cake.<BR>I was especially pleased to see that \\"Zoolander\\" didn't delve nearly so deeply into the \\"gross-out\\" humor of some other Stiller films, especially when more and more so-called comedies seem to be following that path every year.  To be sure, there were jokes about sex and bodily functions, but they were doled out sparingly and never came close to overshadowing the other, more clever dialogue.<BR>Comedy is a tricky thing to critique.  After all, perhaps more than in any other genre, quality is all a matter of personal taste rather than objective criteria.  I personally found this film hilarious and enjoyable enough to watch again and again.  For me, it was a rare find in the virtually endless sea of un-funny comedies constantly appearing in theaters around America.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|From start to finish, this album is filled with amazing, catchy tunes!  I applaud Britney and the producers of the album for creating such an excellent collection of songs.  I rarely listen to an entire album without skipping tracks, however I do so every time I pop this into the cd player!  Some of the best tracks include: Breathe on Me, Toxic, Touch of My Hand, &amp; Everytime.  If you're looking for a great pop album full of good, quality music, then I highly suggest you consider picking this up!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is brilliant and very well written. If you don't usually like movies/shows set in space, that doesn't mean you should disregard this show. There are no aliens, or cheesy creatures.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say I'm INCREDIBLY impressed with this album!  I never thought I'd enjoy a pop record as much as this one, It's truly fantastic!  So many great tracks are included, ranging from sensual and slow songs like Touch of my Hand and Breathe on Me to slick, catchy pop songs like Me Against the Music and Toxic.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who has an open mind and enjoys all different kinds of music.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I tell you, this CD was one that took a few listens...I am a fanatic DT fan - thinking they can do NO wrong - and I must admit, there are some parts of TOT that I was disappointed with...Mind you, a bad DT CD is like bad sex, so take these criticisms with a grain of salt.  DT are VERY ANGRY in this CD, no doubt about it, so it comes off as more of a Metallica thing than their usual 'prog metal' thing.  No comparisons to SFAM at ALL, but hey, do we really want SFAM3 from these guys?  I don't think so...In a world that is SO cruel to anything 'prog' like DT, I just say let them go and do a CD like this - stretch the wings, and do one nasty heavy CD.  And that it is!!  I loved it!!!  For all you DT fans that are expecting something 'beyond' Six Degrees or SFAM, stay away - but for those who have stuck with the band since the early 90's, remember 'Awake'? Yeah, thought so...<br />What I am saying is that yeah, the band could have been tighter here and there, and there are some crap tracks that find JP just wailing on the guitar to no end...but like I said earlier, this is some RAW DT, eat it up and enjoy!  In a day of mostly kind of crappy music, even a mediocre DT effort blows everything out of the water!!!
B000099T2L|1.0|Pretty much every single track on this album is filler, which makes me think Beyonce should have just released a 1 or 2 track album instead of ripping off buyers!  I've never heard such a weak album in my life, it's truly offensive that this crap won 5 grammy awards!  I highly suggest you walk right by this album in the store because it's not even worth your time!!
B00006879E|5.0|This CD has some witty, catchy and peppy lyrics and beats. If you enjoy John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews, Sheryl Crow, Collective Soul...Maroon 5 definatly has the same edgy rock, interesting lyrical-ness.  If you enjoyed any of the singles on the radio you will not be disappointed by the rest of the CD, it carries the same happy insiteful lyrics and melodies. Definatly a worth while purchase!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've never heard such a great pop album in my life!  I'm amazed how good the songs are and how great the music and vocals are.  Judging from some of the atrocious reviews on this site, you would think this album is awful, however it's just the opposite!  I love every single song on this album and it suits any and every mood.  All different ends of the musical spectrum are covered, which makes the album that much more interesting.  No matter what your taste is in music, I guarantee you'll find something to like on this album.
B00005OLY5|4.0|I have to put this at 4 stars instead of 5 when comparing it to Legend for fantasy subject and presentation. I thought Legend's plot was a bit more believable, and the unicorns (like photographer Robert Vavra's creations) were perfect. Only the warrior in Willow was &quot;perfect&quot; as far as my tastes go! If only he were single...<br />The warrior Redfern is handsome and intelligent - nice, instead of just a sweaty grunt - and it was interesting to have &quot;traditional&quot; stereotypes turned around. The good princess is a redheaded baby, not the &quot;mandatory&quot; blond. Willow is a midget, not a big, burly hero type. <br />As far as comparisons to Lord of the Rings, well, Tolkein and CS Lewis influenced alot of fantasy writers and fans, so some similarities would be inevitible. However, basic sci-fi and fantasy stories share common elements and it is easy for a non-writer to think copycatting took place. It probably did not. How many ways can you retell an &quot;evil sorceress wants to rule the world and kill her opposition&quot; story? There is a villain, a protagonist (hero) and something valuable that is in danger, which the hero must save or the villain wins. Eaaasy :-)plot. I'm really surprised no one accused this movie of copying Moses, since the baby is set adrift in a basket, and gets found by her rescuers. The sorceress could be a female copy of Pharaoh. (as if)<br />It's a movie I am buying before VHS is totally wiped out by DVD! I think this can rightfully sit beside Red Sonja, Conan, and Legend on any fantasy lover's shelf...especially if they want &quot;clean&quot; fantasy that is not dark. Not full of gratuitous splatter, either.
B000089RVX|1.0|The hype surrounding this album is truly astonishing, however I feel it doesn't live up to the hype at all.  The lyrics are extremely repetitive and each song is more depressing than the next.  I can't bear to listen to it at all now because it's such a downer!  I feel this band is extremely overrated, especially the lead singer, who has a very weak voice that's piercing to the ears at times.  I don't recommend this album to anyone, I guarantee you'll be disappointed, especially because it's being touted as a 'masterpiece.'
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's list is a masterpice. Filmed in black and white, it delivers incredible authenticity to the story, but most of all intensity. And whenever the director wants you to particularly focus on a \\"movement\\" he would add some colors and depicts the dramatics instants to the fullest (the little girl in red jacket and the candle).<br />The story of Oskar Schindler depicted in this movie (whether 100% correct or not, who cares) is breathtaking. He's a man aspiring for power and money, or at least that's what he thought he wants. Scene after scene, oskar schindler will turn to the man who saved the life of more than a 1000 human lives from Nazi's forces. <br />This movie is fulled with little details, and you'll enjoy discovering them one after the other especially that almost everyone will watch this movie more than once.
B000060P79|5.0|The first time I ever heard of Simple Plan was on MTV. I was just flipping through the channels and I suddenly came upon them singing &quot;Perfect.&quot; I fell in love of the group, and their song, for &quot;Perfect&quot; was exactly what I was going through! (Look at the lyrics) So I bought the cd the next day and I was not disapointed. <br />I'd do Anything 4/5<BR>The tune is really catchy, and I was singing the lyrics at school the next day, but the lyrics are kinda dumb I must admit<br />The Worst Day Ever 4.5/5<BR>This song is awesome! I like songs that make you think, and that you can relate too, and this song sure can relate to some of the days that I've been having lately!<br />You Don't Mean Anything<BR>I always skip over this song, so I can't rate it, plus I don't even think that the version I have of the cd even has this song on it, oh well<br />I'm Just a Kid 5/5 <BR>One of my favorite songs. With lyrics like &quot;I'm just a kid, oh life is a nightmare, I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair I'm alone and the world is having more fun than me tonight&quot; It can really relate to you! (or at least to me it those)<br />Meet You There 3/5<BR>Ok, but I don't like it as well as the other song for some reason<br />Addicted 4/5<BR>The first time I heard this song, I absouletly hated it! But it grew on me after a few more listens.<br />My Alien 3.5/5<BR>Cool! Other then this song those not relate to me at all! I just like it, no clue why though.<br />God Must Hate Me ?/5<BR>This is a kinda funny song, at least it is to me, so it's really hard to rate it<br />I won't be There 4.4/5<BR>This song is cool, in a way that's very hard to explain if you know what I mean!<br />One Day 5/5<BR>Whenever my rents make me really mad, this is the song I listen to! If I were to move out, (even though I'm not even close to finishing highschool) and give them a song that describes me feelings, this would be it. It also has really catchy lyrics<br />Perfect 100/5<BR>The reason I bought this cd! It can really relate to me, and it has great lyrics, a great song, and great vocals from Pierre, as well as drums and guitars! (dont 'member their names) <br />Grow Up- 5/5<BR>I heard this song in Scooby Doo, with my little sister. It's really cool! My best friend hates it, but I like it!<br />Overall, this cd is a A. Great songs, tunes, lyrics, meanings, and these song make you think!
006092988X|5.0|I read this book this year, my freshman year. It has been the best book I have ever read and I keep thinking about it. I think you can gather from the rest of the reviews WHY this book is so good. Just buy it, ya hear? You won't regret it one bit!!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|After hearing all the rave reviews for this movie and seeing it nominated for so many academy awards, I was expecting this movie to be awe-inspiring and full of deep meaning.  Well, to be quite honest...it isn't.<br />I understand where this movie was trying to go.  It was attempting to show that sometimes even the smallest interaction with another human being can lead to major changes in your life.  I know this, but i was still disappointed.  My major gripes with the movie can be summed up in two points though.<BR>   <BR>One: I can appreciate a moment of silence in a movie...but this one had WAY too many.  While Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson each have their moments of great acting, I was too annoyed with the endless silences and long pauses that the movie seemed plagued with to really notice them.  A silent moment to allow the viewer to absorb the visual angle of the movie or as an emphasis on an emotional connection is a wonderful device, but when more than half the movie is completely silent and devoid of character i feel it becomes cliche' and melodramatic.<br />Two: I honestly did not care about their characters.  I am supposed to feel sorry for Charlotte and Bob, but they are both such selfish and flighty people that i found it difficult to empathyze with them.  Perhaps this was the point of the movie, but i feel that i've been cheated when i watch a movie and find no emotional connection with the characters.<br />In short (yeah, right).  I just don't think this movie lived up to the hype that was put on it.  It had some wonderful visual moments and some great acting (at times), but i wouldn't sit through it again, much less buy it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Here is Part 3 of my personal review of Britney Spears' In The Zone. I have rated each song on a scale of 1 to 10.<br />1) Me Against The Music - 9/10. Not the album's VERY best track, but thoroughly enjoyable. Also the long-waited collaboration between Britney and Madonna.<br />2) (I Got That) Boom Boom - 3/10. The one track that I feel could have been left off the album. It would be an acceptable track without the Ying Yang Twins, who I feel are just obnoxious!<br />3) Showdown - 9/10. Nice beat. A smidgen odd at moments, but basically a good, solid track. Should have been Track 2 instead of &quot;Boom Boom.&quot;<br />4) Breathe On Me - 9/10. An interesting blend of an up-tempo with sensual vocals.<br />5) Early Mornin' - 9/10. After a few listens, you find out why this is one of Britney's personal favorites from this album. Nice R&amp;B flavor.<br />6) Toxic - 10/10! I had to save 10/10 for Toxic, the album's standout track. One of Britney's best vocal efforts, with crazy-cool string arrangements and an absolutely irresistible beat!<br />7) Outrageous - 9/10. Like Early Mornin' in that it has an R&amp;B flavor and will really grow on you after a few listens.<br />8) Touch Of My Hand - 9/10. Another sensual, up-tempo track(although I'm not saying it's the same as Breathe On Me in any other way).<br />9) The Hook Up - 8/10. The first time Britney has done anything with a reggae feel since Soda Pop and Thinkin' About You on ...Baby One More Time, only this is much hipper.<br />10) Shadow - 8/10. A good, solid ballad, though Everytime is even better.<br />11) Brave New Girl - 9/10. Not a serious offering, but who wants to be serious all the time? A very simply fun, upbeat song, somewhat in the tradition begun with Anticipating on &quot;Britney.&quot;<br />12) Everytime - 9/10. Britney's best ballad to date, because it was sung from the heart and is very touching. I actually teared up the first few times I listened to it. OK, so I'm a little bit of a sentimental fool, but this song truly is sincere and beautiful.<br />13) Me Against The Music &quot;Desi Kulcha&quot; Remix - 6/10. I can live with it, but it's not very different from the original.<br />In summary, In The Zone has a few small flaws, but it is Britney's best effort to date for both her singing and songwriting, and one of her best all-around albums as well. It's not a perfect album, but few albums are, no matter who the artist is, and I love the variety on this new and different album so much that it has to get 5 stars. This is not like anything else out there right now, and in a good way. You have to listen to it a few times and see.<br />I hope my review has been helpful to you. (At the least, I know it's a hundred times more helpful than the death-threats-badly-disguised-as-reviews some ignorant people leave here. Sorry if you had to experience any of those. I try to be rather objective.)<br />Have a nice day!
0312319517|5.0|I was asked if this book was good. No, it is spectacular. At first, AVENGER seems like a simple tale of revenge, but it is so much more.<br />The story begins with the murder of an idealistic college kid in Bosnia in 1995, and a bereaved grandfather who decides to do &quot;one more good thing.&quot; The Avenger is Cal Dexter, a kid who made his bones in Vietnam crawling down tunnels and wasting Viet Cong. The rest is waiting for you between the covers of this extraordinary book.<br />Mr. Forsyth reminds us of what he did when he wrote THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. The same intensity, twists and turns keep you guessing right up to the end.<br />This book deserves 10 or 15 stars. <br />Run don't walk to your nearest book store get a copy right now!
B0001AP12G|1.0|This album is crap ... his whole production ability is overrated also .. He's the newest best selling crap out that's why people flock to this kinda crap .. To my real rap fans pass over this non-rhyming fools album.. Don't believe the hype .. His 3 mins. of fame will be up.
B00015HVI8|5.0|As I've only watched Stargate as it has come out on DVD, I had no idea what to expect from season six, especially with several of my Daniel Jackson-obsessed friends bemoaning his loss during this season's run.  But Jackson or no, season six is a remarkable addition to the Stargate timeline.<br />The first few shows of the season are in that uncomfortable place of having a few very good elements (the introduction of Jonas Quinn, for me, being one of them) and a few rather questionable ones (as in the episode &quot;Frozen,&quot; where the A-story of finding the preserved body of an apparently 'ancient' advanced human is taken over by the B-story of how this human carries a deadly virus, the episode ending up focusing more on how to cure the virus, forgetting entirely about *explaining* the virus and the human who carried it).<br />However, with the episode &quot;Nightwalkers,&quot; with its stylized cinematography and old-school body-snatchers storyline, the season comes into its own, and the episodes that follow only get more interesting.  Viewers will need a fairly keen memory of shows in seasons past as nearly every episode relies on information learned years ago, but I believe the shows hold up nicely on their own as well, simply through the sophistication of the show's ability to put new twists on classic SF and general drama plots. <br />Not to mention, the show begins to more openly acknowledge and poke fun at other classic science fiction shows, such as Alf (mentioned in &quot;Sight Unseen&quot;) and Star Trek (particularly in the episodes &quot;Unnatural Selection,&quot; in which O'Neill suggests calling their new spaceship the 'Enterprise,' and &quot;The Other Guys,&quot; in which two bumbling scientists try to play heroes and end up nearly ruining an undercover mission-- look for the Klingon Bat'leth used as a random set-decoration in the Goa'uld/Tok'ra's throne room).<br />Stargate fans tend to be very critical of Corin Nemec and his character Jonas Quinn,as he is technically the season six replacement for Michael Shanks's Dr. Jackson, but Jonas is a refreshing change in the line-up.  Where in seasons four and five, Jackson came off as slightly bitter, bored, and morose (seemingly reflecting Shanks's own attitude at the time), Jonas is optimistic, curious, and energetic, and provides a good counterpoint to O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c and their team dynamic.  Much as I like Daniel, it actually makes me sad that Corin Nemec left the show when Shanks asked to come back in season seven.<br />The production values of the show in season six are stellar, with solid scripts, cinematography, directing, sound editing, soundtrack, and, most notably, special effects.  Looking back at season one, Stargate has come a long way in what they are capable of in the realm of computer graphics.  Of course, the slightly under-whelming Asgard puppets are still dragged out on occasion, but the writers have enough self-awareness to let the characters make fun of the suddenly non-CG Asgard (from &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;-- O'Neill: &quot;I thought you were going for a new body.&quot; Thor: &quot;This is my new body.&quot;  O'Neill: &quot;...Right.&quot;).<br />The DVD set for this season is also leaps and bounds ahead of the past collections.  The digital transfer is beautiful, and holds up well on a 43&quot; LCD flatscreen, owing to the improved method of filming used in Stargate's production begun in season five.  The 5.1 Dolby sound is, as usual, more than adequate.  The DVD finally includes the actual opening sequence used in the airing of the show, instead of the 'cross-eyed Ra' opening from the Stargate film that was inexplicably used for the past few seasons.  The graphic design for the DVD cases and menus has finally been updated and looks more subtly sophisticated than before, though using a font for the episode titles that looks strangely like the one used by Lucasfilm for the titles of the Star Wars prequels (a moot point, Iknow, but strange nonetheless).  The Directors Series featurettes included for almost every episode are a welcome addition and a nice attempt at reaching out to the DVD audience, some of them providing amusing and/or unique looks into the production, others doing little more than recapping the episode and showing a few moments from the other side of the camera.  The inclusion of audio commentaries once again (as done in seasons four and five) is equally welcome, and provide both insight (from directors, writers, actors, visual effects supervisors) and humor (particularly from director Peter DeLuise and actor Gary Jones, who plays the recurring character of the nearly-nameless technician, who has appeared in every episode since the beginning of the series).<br />Compared to the often-dull seventh season of Stargate currently running (where B-stories consistently eat their A-stories, and Richard Dean Anderson is barely an on-screen presence) and the horror that has become of the Star Trek franchise, &quot;Enterprise,&quot; season six is looking to be the pinnacle of current televised science fiction.  Huzzah to that.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I love this album.  This was Whitney's first album, and her voice is absolutely angelic--just gorgeous.  Too bad all of her lifestyle choices over the subsequent 15 years have resulted in the Whitney we have today.  Instead of growing into the super-grand diva that this album certainly predicted, we are left with a cracked up, croaky-voiced freakfest.
B00005R62N|5.0|Unleashed In The East(1979). Judas Priest's first live album.<br />Ever since the birth of heavy metal in the late 1960s, there were several bands which left their mark on the next decade, such as Black Sabbath, Saxon, and Rainbow. Judas Priest was another big name to emerge from the 70s, and ultimately in time they created the standard by which true heavy metal music would be judged upon in the 80s. They started out with several experimental albums which were Rocka Rolla(1974), Sad Wings Of Destiny(1976), and Sin After Sin(1977). For the most part these were good albums, though Priest was searching for the right sound to go with. Thankfully they chose heavy metal, otherwise the world wouldn't have the legendary band fans have come to know. Stained Class(1978) and Killing Machine(1979) brought forth this new heavy metal image with leather and studs, the blazing guitar assault of Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing, and the glass-shattering vocals of Rob Halford. At the time, there was simply no band quite like Judas Priest.<br />So after releasing four albums and garnering enough of a fanbase around the world, the band decided that it was time for a live album to showcase all their glory displayed from a live performance. During the Killing Machine tour, Priest simply opened for other bands, but at other parts of the world Priest actually headlined their first full shows. Therefore, the band chose the final leg of the tour in Tokyo, Japan to create Unleashed In The East. Initially this recording was only a nine song offering, but thankfully due to the new remaster treatment now there are 13 tracks total boosting the quality of this live album GREATLY. If one thing is to be noted about UITE, it's that this is definitely one of the LOUDEST and HEAVIEST live recordings ever made, even to this day. I'm sure that back in its time this was considered to be the loudest recording. Whereas Killing Machine was the heaviest Priest recording up to that point, UITE manages to be the heaviest Priest recording for many years until albums like Defenders Of The Faith(1984), Ram It Down(1988), and Painkiller(1990) were released. Even then UITE still holds its own well enough in the context of all Priest albums.<br />Now before talking about the tracks, let's get this out of the way first: many people have infamously nicknamed UITE &quot;Unleashed In The Studio&quot; due to a bit of overdubbing on certain tracks. True, it does sound less raw than a normal live recording would generally be, but take into account that without some studio doctoring certain parts of the album wouldn't be audible. For instance, there were times during a few of the songs where Halford's voice faded in and out due to poor equipment, so the vocals had to be overdubbed. Even with the overdubbing, I thought that they did a good job keeping the sound to how it would be live, so it's really not that noticeable.<br />As for the tracklisting, most all 70s Priest fans will be very pleased with the song selections, as there are plenty of classics to be found from the band's first phase. It kicks off into full gear with 'Exiter', 'Running Wild', and 'Sinner', which serves as a pleasant 1-2-3 punch. Next is the original Priest haunting staple 'The Ripper' and their best cover song, 'Green Manalishi (With A Two-Pronged Crown)', both of which are excellent mid-paced headbangers. The second portion of the show brings the band back to their first albums with OUTSTANDING versions of the cover song 'Diamonds And Rust', 'Victim Of Changes', 'Genocide', and 'Tyrant'. Originally, this is where the album ended, but thanks to the remastering there are four more tracks which rightfully deserve their place in the tracklist. Thus starts the third portion of the show, which consists of several Killing Machine tracks: 'Rock Forever', 'Delivering The Goods', and 'Hell Bent For Leather'. Thankfully the show also ends with a real BANG in an extended version of 'Starbreaker'.<br />Initially I would've given this live recording only 4 stars, but since more tracks were included, I rate it higher. However, unlike what most fans say, UITE is not perfect. I would've also loved to hear some live versions of many underrated 70s Priest masterpieces like 'Deciever', 'Let Us Pray/Call To The Priest', 'White Heat Red Hot', 'Stained Class', and 'Killing Machine'. No big deal really, but it would have been nice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL BIG PRIEST FANS.<br />Other live albums that share similarities to UITE:<BR>-'Live Insurrection' by Halford<BR>-'Speak Of The Devil' by Ozzy Osbourne<BR>-'Live After Death' by Iron Maiden
0385504209|1.0|I'll be blunt: If you liked this book you are an idiot. You know nothing about good writing OR about the Bible. I made it 2/3 of the way through before I tossed the book against the wall. The charactors are made of wood, got sick of the cliche bad guys and cliche cops, and got relly tired of all the facts being distorted or just plain wrong. What a waste of time.. The more I hoped it was going somewhere, the more nowhere it went..
0385507755|5.0|Is an amazing book.  There are many books out there about addiction but this one by far exceeds anything else I have read.  I talked about this book to everyone I knew after I read it because I was so amazed that one person could go through all that Frey did and come out on top.  I cried many times...you will not be able to put this down.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album would've been 5 stars if the songs sounded a lot better.  The lyrics are excellent; Christina has established herself as a respectable songwriter with a style that is unquestionably hers.<br />But unfortunately, I find that reading the lyrics in the booklet is better than hearing the actual songs.  I had a hard time warming up to the songs.  The melodies are only okay; they don't really grasp me. <BR> <BR>For the upbeat songs, \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" \\"Fighter,\\" \\"Make Over,\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" are the best songs.<br />For the ballads, \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Cruz,\\" and \\"I'm OK\\" are the best songs.<br />As for the rest of the songs, they're nothing to \\"wow\\" over.<br />This is a very unique album though.  The lyrics are unique, the way the lyrics fit into their melodies is unique.  But there was just something about the songs themselves that bugged me that I can't quite pinpoint.  I just think the songs could've sounded a lot better.
B00003CX95|1.0|Who is William Wallace? He is Scotlands National Hero,there is even a statue in his honor at the field of Stirling Bridge.This was one of the two most major engagemnts fought against the english in which William Wallace was commander of the forces of Scotlands army.The other major fight was at Falkirk which was a disservice to honor and glory and in truth was to allow for the subsequent martydom of William Wallace.In the film Braveheart,liberties are taken with history so that what we are asked to consider is in fact a motion picture and not an attempt to tell history with a historical purpose.I would recommend to anyone wishing to know better,to go to Scotlands national web site and there you will find a good deal of factual information about the life and history of both William Wallace and the nation of Scotland.It is of worth noting that the archives could not verify the claims made in this picture which sought to take the very heart out of the  marraige vow,with an edict that allowed for the compelling motivation of war.In a manner of speaking this is very nearly baseless showboating and what makes this so very difficult to get out of the way of is that this is a very violent film with so much political rhetoric that the emotion just sort of grabs you,to me this is unfortunate.The film though is correct about a few things and that Wallace was betrayed at Falkirk by the underclass which ruled from behind closed doors.This underclass,if you will, is referred to, as the nobility.There ties where to there lands and titles which had been given to them by the Crown of England.They sought to protect there interests by betraying this very brave man in William Wallace.Though these are but a thousand words William Wallace deserves better and you will find honest information elsewhere.It may not be a popular opinion but to me Braveheart is a dishonest film and it does have the distinction of wining a best picture Oscar.However it will keep your attention and perhaps like it did to me,provide the reader with motivation to know who this William Wallace really is,and better yet you might be able to get out from under the problems mentioned and learn something about the politics of the silver screen.There are so many items that were this to be possible, you would find a different result if in fact the truth as to history and the truth as to Braveheart were written that what is perceived at present would differ considerably with what would be the truth.

0553573403|5.0|It took me three attempts to get through Game of Thrones.  I'd heard enough compelling reviews that I felt like I should read it, but it does take some time before the plot starts unfolding and truly engaging the reader.<br />On my third attempt, I was totally in love with the atypical fantasy world that Martin had created.  He seems to have taken some cues from Asian &quot;fantasy&quot; writers (e.g., Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Water Margin/Outlaws of the Marsh) in structuring the scope of his story, but has brilliantly succeeded not only at constructing an epic among epics in terms of plotting and ingenious plot twists, but also depth of characterization, and readability-- the series staunchly avoids repetition or 'recaps,' and the characters are without excpetion dynamic.<br />Throughout the series, the story shifts between more than a dozen narrators, man and woman, young and old.  And almost without exception, they have intriguing tales to tell.  That in itself is an enormous accomplishment, as most other contemporary fantasy novels tend to have both compelling narrators and some who simply get on readers' nerves-- Robert Jordan springs to mind, as he long since seems to have lacked anything new to say.  Having read the first three installments (around three thousand pages), I've been impressed by the lack of dull moments in the course of the series.  I'm always excited to pick up the narrators' stories, yet always disappointed when a chapter ends.  The only exception is the tale of an exile princess attempting to build an army on another continent-- the only character not in the immediate fray, and whose story is more in a stereotypically fantasy mode.<br />The world Martin has constructed is not your usual fantasy world.  Although populated by people who love idealistic tales of heroism and valor, just like the rest of us, they find the reality to be far different, and far more brutal.  And perhaps most importantly, the line between heroism and villainy is never as clear-cut as anyone would hope.<br />Best of all, Martin has an incredible gift for turning the tables on the reader without ever seeming manipulative, and for developing characters to the point where the reader is forced to rethink his own opinion of each individual.  The series might not mean that the genre finally earns the attention it deserves, but I'm confident that there are many readers out there who will be spellbound by the author's magnificent achievement.

6305657947|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1999.  Knowing it was a remake, I didn't expect much.  However, the presence of Rene Russo, Pierce Brosnan and Denis Leary were enough to push me past my prejudice, and it was an hour and a half (or so) well spent.<br />Anyone looking for anything remotely deep will be disappointed.  This is a fun, fluffy, ultimately consequenceless plot.  Pierce Brosnan, the man who has everything, amuses himself by robbing the Met in New York of a famous painting and then putting it back almost immediately.  Rene Russo, Brosnan's perfect match, is a high class bounty hunter out to catch him.  Naturally, things get complicated when they begin an affair- just for fun at first, but then emotional complications set in.  Denis Leary is the world weary NYC cop who raises his eyebrows in Russo's direction and helps her prove the case against Brosnan, but ultimately states at the end of the movie that in the grand scheme of everything he's seen, he doesn't have a problem letting Brosnan go (lucky for them).<br />From the sets at the Met to the high society parties, restaurant and exotic getaways, the movie is visually satisfying from beginning to end.  And speaking of visuals, anyone watching this movie shouldn't be too much of a prude- there is almost a half hour period where Russo (and Brosnan, to a lesser extent) spend much of their screen time naked.  While both look great, after the first fifteen minutes I did start wondering when they were going to put their clothing back on.<br />The movie is also fast-moving in the appropriate places, particularly when Brosnan makes the initial theft and then foils the sting to capture him.  Of course you have to suspend your disbelief that someone (even James Bond) could pull all of this off, but the plotting is so much fun that you find yourself nodding along.<br />While the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is palpable, I've got to say, I found myself wishing at times that she would choose Leary over Brosnan.  Who knew that Mr. Crass Comedian could do so well as a potential romantic lead?<br />Finally, a word about the original.  I rented the McQueen/Dunaway version shortly after I saw this, thinking it would be even better.  I was bitterly disappointed.  While some of the dynamic between McQueen and Dunaway had hints of the chemistry in this movie, the whole tone of the movie was ultimately much more nihilistic than this 90s bit of fluff. And robbing a bank?  Been there!Brosnan.  Who knew that Mr. Crass Comedian could do so well as a potential romantic lead?<br />Finally, a word about the original.

B00004U2G4|5.0|i can't give any bad credits on this one. excellent digitally remaster. there was not 1 song i disliked on this cd. first time in owening jeff beck masterpiece. the only songs i heard before was off rod stewart-storyteller. shape of things and i ain't superstitious.
B00005JMNA|5.0|people try to compare this film to the 1987 dirty dancing and apart from Patrick Swayze being in both,there is no comparison.i love this film,it deals with issues from the 1950's,racism and social class as well as the cuban take on those american yankees using their country as some sort of country club hide away.Diego Luna is great in all his films and this movie is no exception,the dancing is hot and newcomer Romola Garai reminded me of a sweet teenage Cameron Diaz.if you havent seen this movie SEE IT TODAY!
0393317552|4.0|Wow- it seems like all of the reviewers of this book have been completely polarized. I guess I would rather take the work for what it is worth. What is it worth...?<br /><br />  Well many of the chapters are truly fascinating reads! Almost on the same-page turning numbness as you will find in a good crime novel. However, other chapters are brutally slow, and you can't help but let you mind wander.<br /> Religon is virtually ignored for any of his analysis, except that certain religons helped to provide a social framework, which allowed for more structured societies. I guess from an anthroplogist perspective the views of religon are irrelevant in the rise and fall of societies.<br />  Don't get me wrong... this is a thought provoking book. And I feel important in having a basic understanding of why we are what we are. Does it mean everything is completely factually correct? No.... I'd be willing to bet there are some errors (although it is far beyond my ability to point individual flaws). My best guess at an &quot;Error&quot; is his analysis that geography as the main predictor of technological break throughs(as other reviewers have pointed out). However, I think that the Catholic Church proved to be pretty adept at bottling up technology (at least that was the case about 600 years ago!)<br /> And yes, it does seem like Mr. Diamond has a bit of an agenda. However, despite what agenda he made of had (what author writes without ANY agenda?) I feel that he tried to be sincere. Through his effort we have a very realistic analysis of how we may have gotten from the Garden of Eden (my words and not his) to New York City.<br /><br />  So there you have it! All tied up into four stars (not 5 because of the occassional dullness factor). Certainly not a read for everyone, but one that history buffs may enjoy!
B00018D44U|2.0|Yeah, &quot;some&quot; people are saying how disappointed they are with Norah's turn of the musical tide (blues to countryish)and they are right. BUT It is very difficult to have two crowd-roaring successes in the timespan of two years but still...<BR>Here are several impressions I had of &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;<br />Her last CD was hauntingly beatiful..this one is reminds me of clomping ponies at the state fair. It also uses the same idea throughout the CD..the &quot;oh why did you leave, I can live with out you, please come back&quot; thingy<br />*The cover color is very warm and &quot;folksy&quot; and Norah looks down to the floor to reminisce about something...maybe she's falling alseep to the sound of her own songs on &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;<br />*Where did this new &quot;band&quot; come from? With the pics that come with the CD, they kinda look like overgrown college students who wear those thick rimmed glasses and are really smart. They sort of just appeared into the spotlight too...wierd<br />*Some of the songs are a bit tired, some even sounding like poetry you write in the 5th grade (ex: When I look into your eyes, I can feel the butterflies) Each line has the same number of syllibles too! AND many words were repeated throughout diffent songs, it was annoying at times: Like <BR>What DID you say...What DO you say--Creepin' up, Creepin' in<BR>Maybe that's just me though...<br />Norah says that she has moved on into a another style of music because &quot;that was the way she felt then and this is the way she feels now&quot; but the last one was by far the better.
0060935456|5.0|My father read us this book (skipping what he thought were the boring parts) when I was in elementary school. I tried to check it out of the library, but was told I needed adult permission to do so (so glad library policies change!). Being the ever devious fourth grader that I was, I plunked down a quarter at the next library book sale and bought my very own second hand copy. I have read and reread that copy and purchased new ones. I think I have three at present. All this to say that this is one of the all time best novels ever written in the English language. Sweeping adventure, personal struggles, mythology, wars &amp; intrigue and wondrous travelogue all in one. If you have ever let the idea that this book centers on a group of &quot;bunnies&quot; keep you from reading it, put that out of your mind. The characters are based on Adams's military unit and they are quite human. At times frightening and at others laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book you will live as much as read. And when you give it a chance it will sweep you away.

B0000064TT|5.0|In the late '70's, I went to see someone else, and the Dixie Dregs happened to be the opening band.  All I knew about them was they were on Capricorn, the &quot;southern rock&quot; label.  And when they came onstage, as I expected they looked &quot;southern rock&quot;--but then they started to play some of the most challenging and original music I had ever heard.  I was transfixed, certain I was an early witness to an emerging musical genius.  Most of the material was from this album, just released.  I bought it the next day.  &quot;What If?&quot; was an instant classic, and a defining work.  The sound and style are strikingly original.  The compositions are brilliant, spanning an incredible range of styles, with stops at rock, blue grass, classical, and jazz.  The players are each instrumental geniuses, so technically adept they run the danger of being too facile.  The music is mercurial, a blend of tight ensemble playing, well focused solos, and lightning fast interchanges between the performers.  The Dixie Dregs demonstrated on &quot;What If?&quot; they were fully equal to the original Mahavishnu Orchestra or the Chick Corea/Stanley Clarke/Al DiMeola version of Return To Forever.  And a lot of fun to listen to.
0671891634|4.0|They've has done it again, this book is very funny and filled with useful tips from seasoned investor Peter Lynch. This book has several of \\"Peter's Principles\\" (which are very humorous one-liners that make a lot of sense for investors.) My favorite parts of this book are: The story about the St. Agnes 7th grade portfolio managers (these kids beat out 99% of fund managers when they had a two year gain of 70%.) Another part of this book that I enjoy are the subtle tips for evaluating stocks. Mr. Lynch doesn't tell you to do this, that, and another thing to find the ten-baggers, but he does give clues throughout the text.<br />Reed Floren
B00009V7RF|5.0|I first heard this c.d. in a listening booth at my local record store, and from the get go, I was truly impressed.  I purchased it right away.<BR>Now this is solid hip-hop with a great mixture of 70's funk.  It's blended so well that the whole album leaves you always anticipating the next song, till it climaxes with the superb single, &quot;Where Is The Love&quot;.  <BR>The Black-eyed Peas were good before, but with the addition of Fergie's vocals, Elephunk takes them to new heights, more harmonies and a unique hip-hop that takes you away from the humdrum stuff that has been polluting our airwaves (hello 50 cent and Ja Rule).<BR>Buy it, sounds great at a party!!!!!
0679879269|5.0|I am so utterly in love with the HDM triology.  From the moment I picked up \\"The Golden Compass\\" I was attached to the hip.  Friends and lovers had to pry the book from my hands because it was supper time.  <BR>Pullman is a writer that I easily took to.  Every paragraph was so clean and crisp.  The way he describes the children, the adults and especially the daemons (people's soul perse) is breathtaking.  <BR>I love Philip so much for this masterpiece!!!!
B00012L786|5.0|Samuel Fuller's \\"Pickup on South Street\\" is easily one of his better films and as cynical and tough as crime dramas got in the 50's. Richard Widmark is excellent as a cocky pickpocket who swipes the wallet of sexy Jean Peters that contains microfilm of government secrets to be delivered to a Communist agency. Peters is unaware of the Communist angle and is only doing a \\"job\\" for her slimy ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley (who's also excellent). Getting mixed up in the mess to get back the microfilm is street peddler/police informant Thelma Ritter who sells information to whoever wants to buy it. The film is gritty and unsentimental and none of the characters are saints. New York City is depicted as a tough place to survive especially on the dirty waterfront where Skip McCoy (Widmark) lives and stashes his loot and Moe Williams (Ritter) plies her trade. Candy (Peters) is a girl who's been around due to a shady past and never known a decent man in her life. She's trying to survive too. Peters (who's miles away from her ingenue in \\"Niagara\\" also the same year} is sexy and streetsmart with the bad-girl swagger that only Gloria Grahame knew how to pull off. Ritter earned an Oscar nomination for her role as Moe and she is simply fantastic as a doomed fringe-dweller who's getting tired. The film is a good hard look at crime and the school of hard knocks. The Communist plot line is only that---a plot line. The film takes no political stand. It's a story of people doing what they do to survive and the understanding between them that \\"everybody's gotta eat\\". \\"Pickup on South Street\\" is a fine noir crime film and another excellent DVD package from Criterion with lots of good extras. THIS is a collector's item.
B0000019PA|5.0|buy this.  its so fantastic, and so different from anything i've ever heard.  totally brilliant.  totally groundbreaking.
B00018TI5E|5.0|What can I say about John Frusciante that hasn't already been said?  The man is a walking miracle, overcoming a near-death battle with heroin and parlaying the sanity he almost lost into one of the most successful comeback stories in rock history.  While the first of his two comeback albums with the Chili Peppers, Californication, was a little too RHCP by-the-numbers for my taste, By the Way, the second, was the most musically mature pop album the Chili Peppers have released in their two decades as a group. I'm convinced that it's success stems not from the stereo-typical, fan-favorite tandem of Keidis and Flea but from the creative wellspring and innate guitar prowess Frusciante channels from the spirits and demons he has admitted he uses as inspiration.  Following up on his wonderful, but inconsistent, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, SCWP offers overwhelming support for the above hypothesis.  The opener Carvel, with a NES Metroid-like blipping, effervescent interlude, soars with the triumph of a man who has momentarily overcome that which none of us can escape, death.  Carvel feels almost like a spiritual catharsis, a song that is on the precipice of translating a mystical experience into music. Omission, with the dichotomy of it's somber verse and upbeat sweeping chorus and solo could have easily fit in on By the Way.  The song ends with a primal scream that sounds like it could have been delivered from the mouth of Kurt Cobain or Plastic Ono Band-era Lennon.  Regret, when taken in context with John's first solo, Niandra Des Ledes, is poignant and beautiful, even if it is a little redundant.  Water, the funkiest and perhaps most catchy and poppy track on the album, is another listening pleasure that could have been recorded for a Chili Peppers release.  Perhaps my favorite track, Chances, is a collaboration with sonic wizard Omar Rodriguez of Mars Volta fame, on whose album De-Loused in the Comatorium, John provided lead guiatr work for the 13 minute jam-session that comprised the track Inertiatic ESP.  Chances, which clocks in at barely two minutes, is a druggy track with a Revolver-era Beatles feel.  It seems to be a retrospective look at John's life by the artist himself, with an assurance to himself and potentially despondent listeners that they still have a part to play in their lives even if it feels as though they have destroyed a much of it.  Frusciante sings that \\"in the multi-dimensional scheme, you'll know what I mean.\\"  The song leads into another spacey instrumental, ambient-noise track, reminiscent of Meddle-era Pink Floyd that I appreciate but normally skip over because I've heard enough of the real the thing to last a lifetime.  The final track, the Slaughter, a collaboration with bandmate Flea, is a great love ballad, an ode to loss that like most of Frusciante's songs has an undercurrent of hope beneath the exterior.  SCWP is the most listenable, and accessible of John's albums, but not the best; that honor goes to the painful to listen to Niandra des Ledes & Usually Just a T-Shirt.   It does however surpasse almost every other piece of work the man has created, and that even includes his famed recordings with the Chili Peppers from his teenage years and his last brilliant solo album.  This, combined with the Frusciante-fueled progressive direction the RHCP took on By the Way, means we, as music fans, have much to look forward to from this artistically gifted phoenix.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|5 Stars, that is the rating I gave this DVD set and it was an absolute joy to watch. To see the characters that I grew to love in the original run, to hear the snappy witty dialogue...well I almost wish that I had not bought the set. It just serves as a reminder to all the crap that is currently on the small screen with a few exceptions(arrested development for one). It honestly made me sad to realize that there are no more new episodes coming out. FOX, well I think anyone that sees the series will feel the same way about FOX that I do, a shortsighted network that never gave this series its due.<BR>After every episode that is on the set I just shake my head and smile at the brilliance that is Firefly. I highly recommend this DVD set but be advised at the end you will just be hurting for more!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a beautiful film, but for those who argue over how it shows whether you are &quot;intellectual&quot; or not, I say that it is not about the intellect. It is about the heart.<br />Brilliant performances from Johannson and Murray (who considers it his best film), sensitive direction from Coppola, as well as a script that requires you to watch and understand what's going on with the characters for yourself rather than telling you everything because it thinks you won't get it otherwise. I wanted to spend more time with these people.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a truly classic disc.  Listen to every song in order without skipping anything, it's amazing.  Very unique, talented, almost weird...it's so different from anything else out there, even different than Maynard's (lead singer) other band, Tool.  <br />This cd is much more mature and sophisticated than any other rock album i've probably ever heard.  The best track (in my opinion) is &quot;The Noose&quot;....it's very complex and layered.  The song keeps building, wow!, a great song.  <br />If you bought APC's first album, Mer De Noms, and didn't like it that much, then you may STILL enjoy this cd...honestly, i thought their first cd was about 2.5/5 stars..this cd is better in every way.<br />There aren't any fillers in the album, it flows so well from song to song, and the instraments are well done.  If you like Tool or A perfect circle's first cd, you'll like it...if you don't like tool or a perfect circle's first cd, you'll still like it. If you're expecting a cd like Creed or Nickelback, where every song sounds the same, you'll be surprised by how unique and different the tracks are and how good the music is.<br />Definitely worth buying to support the band and encourage this kind of music(rather than downloading for free).
B00008EYA5|2.0|You have seen this movie before. No really. You have. Maybe in different movies, but you have seen it. Every cheesy stereotype that typically is part of the Hollywood film experience is here and you will groan in recognition. The rebellious protagonist, the tough single mom, the insufferable, paper pushing boss, the team of people that no one believes in who prove themselves in the end, the evil foreigner and oh, the weak link in the group who betrays them. The only stereotype missing is the Jewish best friend. Even the dialogues are full of what the script writer thought were smart one liners. The action scenes are slick and the movie moves along at a fair clip, but you've seen it all before, and better rendered so why bother watching this?
B00005JMNA|5.0|While this film is a bit cleched, it is still a wonderful movie. Romola Garai and Diego Luna (two very talented young actors)lead an excelent cast in this based on true events / prequel / remake of the original Dirty Dancing (staring Patrick Swazye and Jennifer Grey). In my opinion Havana Nights is far supirior to the original. The acting is MUCH better, and the costume and set designs more realistic. However it is the beautiful dancing, as well as the standout soundtrack that really steal the show.
B0001AP12G|1.0|There was a lot of hype over this Kanye West album and I thought it would be good so I bought it.  When I listened to it I was very disappointed.  First of all this guy can't rap and he can barely even rhyme.  I don't know what Jay-Z was thinking when he signed this idiot to rocafella.  Kanye Wests style is terrible and he is a hypocrite.  I also think he is very racist and his lyrics are offensive.  This guy is a joke so don't waste your money on this stupid crap.  If you want a great album I highly recommend Twistas new album Kamikazi and forget about that retard Kanye West.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Great swashbuckeling movie in the ilk of any Flynn movie you might see.  The visuals are fantastic and the rolling of the ocean will almost make you loose your grog.  This is also the last time you will ever see the French actually fight in a battle without first surrendering...<br />Two big thumbs up!
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album is about 1000% times better than her other work and a million times better than britney spears.  This girl can sing!   I listen mainly to hard rock, but this is one cd that is so good, i had to review it.  <br />It's got everything, slow ballads, rap, dance, pop(but not bubblegum pop like she used to do).  <br />The best pop album of the year, i think...much more mature and sophisticated than most pop music today...definitely worth purchasing.  If you buy the top 40 singles or download them off the internet, you'll be missing the better, more talented songs.  The only gripe is that there are too many short tracks (4)breaking up the rhythm of the music.<br />The slower, ballad-type songs are the best...they show off her talent and voice.  These would include &quot;keep on singin' my song&quot;, &quot;i'm ok&quot;, &quot;the voice within&quot;, &quot;impossible&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; &amp; &quot;walk away&quot;.
B00008EY9G|4.0|The movie is off to a brilliant start. A serial killer is being given a last minute review of his death sentence (insanity plea) even as 10 people find themselves in a motel where they are being killed one by one. The psychiatrist is arguing the serial killers case.  Meanwhile, the people in the motel discover that people are being killed according to their motel room numbers. They are all very different, a soap opera star, a chauffeur, a call girl, a cop, but they all have one thing in common. They were all born on the 10th of may. Who is killing them? One of them? The spirits of Ancient Indians on whose burial ground the hotel is built? The serial killer? Are these people seemingly normal people, or is there something more to them.<br />If you are a psychological thriller fan, the ending won't surprise you. Afterall, the premise is one of the most popular in this genre of film. However, it has never been protrayed as interestingly. I heard gasps in the theatre as the `truth' was revealed. It won't make you scream, or startle but the plot is very well crafted. It takes very creative writing to make a suspenseful film based on such a done to death premise. Watch it and prepare to be misled.
B00008973A|4.0|&quot;A Chorus Line&quot; is the film version of the Broadway smash hit about a troupe of dancers (notice I didn't say young)auditioning for their chance to hit the big time on Broadway. Boy, talk about cyclical logic: from Broadway to Hollywood to Broadway to box office bomb!  Unfortunately for director, Richard Attenborough nothing is quite as thrilling as being in the live audience on opening night. However, the film does have its moments. Michael Douglas heads the cast as a wary, though compassionate, Broadway choreographer who's looking for his eight hungry hopefuls.  He finds them and the truth beyond the footlights in a bittersweet story that, At the time of its release, was generally reamed by the critics for its hockum, heavy-handed direction and lack of stardust magic.<BR>TRANSFER: There's lots to celebrate here. A near flawless transfer from MGM that sparkles with a well balanced color palette that, while dated, captures the luster of 80s Technicolor. Black and contrast levels are right on. Occasionally the picture looks a tad on the soft side but fine detail is fully realized throughout. There are no digital anomalies for a smooth picture. The audio is 5.1 and provides a very nice spread over all channels.<BR>EXTRAS: A Marvin Hamlisch retrospective that's short but refreshing and an audio commentary.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This is a vintage 80s lemon that squeezes more like an orange. It's not nearly as sour as the critics of its day claimed and, since the transfer is fairly rich and stunning I have to recommend this one for your DVD library, especially if you're a musical buff.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|So basically the point of this movie was, don't do drugs.  It was obvious halfway through, maybe even before then.  But even though you've realized that, you just can't stop watching it.  I saw it at a friend's house and it will not leave my head.  <br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is most definitely the saddest movie I've ever seen.  I tried to read the book about a year ago and could not get through it, however the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The camera angles, first of all, completely astounded me.  I loved the way they portrayed the drug-use scenes and when they used screen splits and whatnot.  The characters were very, very well portrayed, especially Sara.  She broke my heart the most.  I can go on about my favorite parts but I won't spoil it.<br />My only advice is, this is not a movie for those of you who get sad easily and don't enjoy it.  I'm one of those sensitive types and I love movies that screw with my head so that's sort of a bad combination...and this was definitely a movie I shouldn't have seen.  I loved it but, now that I know how horribly miserable it is, I will never see it again because it depressed me so much.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I knew from the beginning how dumb it was going to be.  Uma Thurman knocks on the door and her and Vivica Fox start fighting.  Then there's some cussing.  Then more fighting.  Then we go on to more scenes.  More fighting.  More cussing. Enter Lucy Liu (who sucks by the way).  More fighting. More cussing.  Get the gist yet?  That pretty much about sums up the movie.  Fighting and cussing. And not to mention overdone graphic blood scenes to hide an otherwise inept plotline.  Oh and by the way, who was Bill?  Oh yeah that's right, we have to see volume 2.  So in other words, Tarantino is cashing in for two movies because you would have to see whatever the hell is going to go on in the second one.  Like anyone cares at this point.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I borrowed this CD because I am going to see the musical on Broadway, I immediately fell in love with it.  It is probably my favorite Musical's CD.  I haven't even seen the play, yet I already love the music!<BR>The two stars are AWESOME!!!!  You can't help but have either &quot;What is this feeling&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, or &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; embedded into your brain.  They are awesome.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Being a Tolkien geek who's read the books every year for over 20 years, I was thrilled, yet apprehensive, that the movies were being made.  And as a Tolkien geek, I had quite a few questions after seeing FOTR and TT (why some characters' roles were changed or scenes invented).  This extended edition DVD set, and the one before it, has answered all of my questions.<br />I didn't expect to love the movies as much as I did.  I don't think any of the changes from the book were bad; I just wondered why they were made.  The included commentary from Peter Jackson and the other writers/developers clarifies that there is a HUGE difference between a great book and a great movie.  That is, some scenes/roles are just a big snore if you try to play it literally.<br />The additional scenes on the DVD are nice, but it's easy to see why they were left out for the theater release.  The movie was already loooong.  Another reviewer said that TTT was really not meant to stand alone as a movie (or book), and I agree.  Of the three, TTT was hardest for me to sit through in the theater just because, in addition to being so long, as a stand-alone it seemed a little disjointed (as is the book).  However I think the DVD extras and commentary are excellent, and smoothed out the transition between this movie and FOTR.<br />Also, I just like knowing how movie magic is made.  And there are definitely HOURS (read: perhaps TOO many) of that to be watched in this set, if that's your thing.<br />Overall this DVD set is definitely worth owning, whether you liked the books and/or the movies.
B00012QM8G|4.0|?Schindler?s List? is the engrossing masterwork about the holocaust from director, Steven Spielberg, a broad and far reaching example of all the human emotion and poignancy that motion pictures are capable of achieving under the right circumstances. For this reviewer at least, there is a single moment worth noting in which Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) pulls out his pistol and nonchalantly murders a Jewish engineer as she stands by the side of the road. In most cases, Hollywood has often had a way of glamorizing such acts so that they appear staged for the camera. But in this case, the sudden loss of life is handled with such meticulous craftsmanship that for a moment the viewer becomes overwrought in what appears to be a very genuine and sudden loss of human life. Of course, the film is not centered on Goeth but on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German industrialist who, along with his Jewish book keeper, Itzak Stern (Ben Kingsley) sets out to rescue hundreds of Jews from their fate at the concentration camps by employing them in his factory right under the Nazis noses. Neeson?s performance is perhaps a bit too subdued to be believed, excelling more as the faux Nazi sympathizer than the hero that he actually was. The visceral score by John Williams brings all the plot elements together with a tragic musical crescendo. <br />The DVD transfer is, for the most part, very nicely balanced. The black and white picture exhibits a solid gray scale with deep blacks. Film grain seems a bit excessive during the latter half of the movie with background information breaking apart because of sometimes excessive pixelization, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details. The audio is 5.1 surround and exhibits a very rich and nicely spread sound field with considerable bass. Universal has made ?Schindler?s List? available as both a two disc bare bones edition and a box set. Extras on the two disc edition are a real disappointment,  with only a modest documentary and some junket material. There?s not even a collector?s booklet included. Also, the hard cover packaging is awkward to store. The deluxe edition contains considerably more in the way of extra features and comes in a handsome box. It is also three times the money of the two disc edition.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|I was of the belief that helicopters wern't invented until WW2 or later, but after seeing this excellent movie, and the moors scene where one is chasing our hero, I realise that I was mistaken. What an excellent film, and the best thing about it was that there were lots more to come from Hitchcock. Robert Donat's character is very likable, completley unflappable. He never seemed to take his situation seriously at all, no matter how dire things seemed. Reminded me of Simon Templar of the SAINT. A BIG BIG reccomendation from me. See it, and see it again.
B00009W0U4|5.0|i think that this is a great film.  It is in the same way using imagery to give you a certain feeling of the points of the fillm.  I really dont like that people dont like it because they would like a movie like blue velvet or a clockwork orange for beautiful imagery but this is showing it to have more of a feeling of the emotions and the tone of the film.  Its a bit hypocritical.  I do understand however that a person wouldnt like it because the context and content were too harsh.  I felt a bit ill after a scene in it myself.  The acting was really good.  There was good chemistry between alex and marcus.  Even though the ending was nice i still felt a little disturbed by the begining and the feeling is irreversible.
B00005QW5X|5.0|When I first saw this I was told it was just like Rocky Horror, and hearing this from people equally obsessed wtih Rocky Horror, i knew it had to be true. But no! They lied! This is even BETTER than rocky horror. <br />Not only is the music great and fun and hysterical, but the story actually has purpose too, I even caught myself crying a few times. Mostly laughing though...<br />this is definitely one of my new favorites, you definitely want to see this
B0000AUHQT|2.0|The Great Gatsby\\" (1974) is a story of decadence and decay from the 1920s, spawned from the pen of imminent author, F.Scott Fitzgerald. It?s full of wanton greed, lust, sex and murder set during the flapper age. Robert Redford is the quintessential sexy, Jay Gatsby. He?s at once a charmer and a recluse, throwing lavish parties on his Long Island estate for the ritzy jet set, though rarely attending except in absentee through a bird?s eye view from his second story window. But Gatsby?s unassuming secretiveness is brought into the light when he meets gawky paramour, Daisy Buchanan (Mia Farrow). She?s a godless, flighty flapper, married to a wealthy playboy, Tom (Bruce Dern), and cousin to the introspective, Nick Carraway (Sam Waterston) the young man living on the cottage near Gatsby?s estate. Nick is genuine and Gatsby, sensing that he can trust Nick, confides in him his romantic interests in Daisy. The two become lovers ? a relationship which is genuine for Gatsby but shallow, fleeting and inconsequential to Daisy. She soon returns to Tom who decides to set Gatsby up with the accidental hit and run of Myrtle Wilson (Karen Black) that he has committed. Tom and Myrtle used to be an item and Tom?s impregnation is passed off as Gatsby?s, leaving Myrtle?s distraught husband, George (Scott Wilson) with murder on his mind.  Despite a screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and stellar production values the film generally misses its mark in recanting the tale of a millionaire playboy, brooding away in his locked mansion for the woman that he lost. There's just something about Fitzgerald's writing that doesn't translate well to the big screen.<BR>The transfer is a huge, strange disappointment. Despite being anamorphically enhanced the picture elements look as though they've been fed through a meat grinder. Age related scratches and often excessive film grain crop up throughout, while some scenes are remarkably free of either distraction. The contrast levels during the dusk scenesare way too low. Colors are generally muted and during several scenes even bleed. There are digital artifacts throughout including more than a hint of edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. The audio is barely stereo and really weak in its spread. There are no extras.
B000002UDD|4.0|After listening to the amazing Eust in Peace and Peace Sells, I go this as my 3rd megadeth album.  Many of my friends told me not to waste my time cause its a horrible album, but I did not listen to them.  I hear that this cd was rushed and put out just to be put out; that megadeth did not care about the quality of their work.  Though this may be true to an extent (dave mustaine and ellefson both admit that they were super junkies and supremely high while recording this album), i dont think its that terrible of an album.  but you can definitely tell that close to the end of the album, the... degree of how high some of the musicians are gets larger and larger... <br />Into the Lungs of Hell- GREAT OPENER.  This is a great instrumental though it does not have the big repetition of Orion, it is short at 3 minutes and the high parts are excellent and accurately played.  A<br />Set the World Afire-  this song is merged with Into the Lungs of Hell cause it starts exactly where the previous track ends and ItLoH actually fades into this song.  The reverb on the guitar in this song is huge, but the voice morphing that dave does is great and the riff is awesome. A+<br />Anarchy in the UK-  Not that terrible of a song, but im not sure how it fits.  You really gotta listen to it for yourself.  A-<br />Mary Jane-  wow... musically, im not sure that its the best of megadeth, but its about a witch named Mary Jane.  interesting... but the riff used is pretty good and catchy... but it is used again in IN my Darkest Hour, though they do vary. B<br />502- Oh my god...  listen to the beginning where dave goes &quot;wooo wooo&quot; to simulate the police sirens and you know that hes as high as a kite.  man, well this song is ok not my favorite on the album  B+<br />In My Darkest HOur- dave doesnt really sing in this song, he just says the words, but thye riff is great, a nice variation from Mary Jane.  Im not too sure how much of a dedication this is to Cliff Burton, look up the lyricscause its kinda strange.  a nice search on google will do you.  U can tell that megadeth particularly only likes this song off the album cause its the only one that they have from this album on Capitol Punishment and Rude Awakening, compilations of songs from various albums that they had released.  A+<br />Liar-  the lyrics here are hilarious, but who are they talkin about?  the guitar is good cause the riff in the beginning is awesome.  but i dont get it cause on my cd (yes its legit), but the song just ends, while it sounds like it is going into another part of the song.  I dont know why this is, but maybe its cause of the poor production.  C (cause of the cut off end)<br />Hook IN Mouth-  I hate this song and the way that dave sings the chorus makes me so angry.  GOod thing this is at the end of the album.  Lyrics dont really makes sense and dave sounds like he is seriously dying at the end.  (C-)<br />Its obvious that megadeth does not really like this cd, and with what dave was going through at the time, its a time in his past that i am sure that he would not like to remember.  As for the worth, I am not too sure.  There are 3 really great songs out of 8.
0312263120|2.0|Because I had been fovorably impressed, but not swept over, by Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code', and because I am an amateur, very amateurish cryptography buff, I bought 'Digital Fortress'. One of the positive traits I had found in DVC was, in a general way, the considerable efforts invested by D. Brown in research. Whereas in Digital Fortress, the inaccuracy that borders on flippancy, of most of the cryptographic information displayed in the book cannot be the result of serious research. Of course, this is first and foremost a work of fiction. I do not expect it to be a treatise on cryptography. But an acceptable compromise could have been attained. In my modest opinion, it wasn't. So read it for fun, but just so.
B00009Z576|4.0|DRAMA provides all the original album tracks; 2 single versions; plus 2 early demo tracks of material by Horn, Downes, Squire, White, and Howe.  While having DRAMA completes any YES fan's catalog, with the additional bonus tracks, one can clearly see YES in changes.  I'd have to agree that several DRAMA tracks stand out- Downes' keys seem to pick up nicely in Wakeman fashion on Machine Messiah and Tempus Fugit is a lost YES classic.  Howe's guitar and Squire's always inovative bass keep this YES; though this line up is all most like a tribute band inviting YESmen to preform YESlike tunes- this is not an insult in any way.  There's much more deepness to the entire package...  Especially on Machine, one gets an early taste of trademark ASIA sound with glimpses of Howe and Downes complementing each other.   Also, through out DRAMA, Squire's bass establishes the deep twang that we've all grown to love.  Some of the keyboard styling by Downes would be carried on through Horn in later productions for YES on the Rabin/Kaye 90125 &amp; Big Generator albums...  The bonus tracks make the extra bucks worth it.  You get to see where YES was going (or not) after TORMATO with Anderson &amp; Wakeman.  And the 2 tracks with just Squire, White &amp; Howe after Anderson &amp; Wakeman left show a desire to forge ahead (though you can almost imagine inserting Anderson's vocals with backing Wakeman keys in your head while listening).  Really, there's a lot here.  You hear the decline of the classic 70's lineup;  the transitional lineup with Horn/Downes; with the foundations for what YES (and even ASIA- to a lesser extent) would become.
0385504209|2.0|Lots of information which is supposed to be fact set around a preposterous story line make this book hard to swallow.  Sorry only 2 stars.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am absolutely thrilled to see that Sarah McLachlan has return after half a dozen years after her previous release, 1997's multi-platinum release \\"Surfacing\\" and her latest album \\"Afterglow\\" continues the streak of excellent songwriting and touching music she's brought since the grunge era. Even the during that period where grunge cut both ways for me, I first heard \\"Possession\\" and the song really stood out against almost everything else from that time and made me a fan of hers for good. <br />This newest album is also calmer and much more on the sad side considering that the two major emotional events that inspired this album almost like the sadness of the darkening daylight hours of approaching winter but also positive like the returning warmth of the approaching spring. Unlike the previous two albums which had a very mainstream appeal, \\"Afterglow\\" has a very mature and melancholy mood that may make it difficult to make it's way on the pop charts which have become too naïve in character but this album's deservedly popular status is evident as it ranks so high up on the album charts. The only mainstreatm song on here in my opinion is the song \\"Stupid\\". Don't let the title fool you, this is actually a very intelligent and energetic song that starts as a very haunting jazzy mood and rises into a very alternative rock height towards the ending to create a very dramatic and compelling song. <br />My favorite part of this whole album is the two track combo \\"Drifting\\" and \\"Train Wreck\\". \\"Drifting\\" is a really haunting and seductive song although it's a bit short for me. The song perfectly ends which merges right into the intro of the next song \\"Train Wreck\\". This song has a very cool intro and becomes an amazing and thought-provoking track with a mix of rock, pop, and very mature, sophisticated jazz all blended in on one song! \\"Push\\" is nothing to really write home about. \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" is a very eerie, piano-oriented song that has a very uncertain feel to it and ends the album on an eerie note. <br />The CD is unfortunately on the short side and while the music is just gorgeous, the length leaves a lot to be desired. Although, not disappointing on a musical note, at barely 40 minutes, I kind of feel a bit cheated as I spent nearly eighteen-hundred pennies on it. Then again I'm just simply spoiled at some amazing albums that came in at over 60 minutes in playing time. Veteran fans should definitely go for this album as it continues her great streak of music but newbies or those unfamiliar with McLachlan's music would be better off starting with \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" but anyone looking for just plain great music for the soul will be rewarded with this CD. Buy it today!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This is the first soundtrack I've ever bought in my life, and I have been so moved by it.  I find the music beautiful, moving, even soothing, and brings back to me the strong emotions that I felt in the movie itself while realizing the depth of Jesus's love for humankind. The music completes the movie, and yet stands alone as a beautiful compilation of music with a touch of Middle Eastern flavor that evokes depth of feelings, at least to this listener. There is power, and there is tenderness. I love it.  I don't know what else to say.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|From now on , I will listen to the song samples Amazon offers , because Room on Fire , as Fountains of Wayne Wellcome ... and Newsboys Thrive and ... ect... are uninspiring recordings of mediocre value . The money I spend thinking that Rolling Stone , etc... know what they are talking about is a shame , when I could B listening to more inspiring talent . Oh well , this should teach me a lesson ....
B00003CX5P|2.0|Here we go again with the usual stick up for Lucas or say it for what it was, a clunker. Natalie Portman didn't seem to take this movie seriously as well along with ep. II, thinking SW was just a step in her career along with her Harvard education. A wasted opportunity which Depp took advantage of in POC. Way to go Lucas, it takes a producer/director who doesn't care or know how to make a quality film to let this performance slide. At least Jake Lloyd had some idea what he wanted to do for his role even inexperienced as he was. Same with Hayden Christensen. Even Elijah Wood auditioned a homemade videotape to Jackson doing a skit with his friends about LOTR. Samuel Jackson as miscast as he is, would have worked better than Liam Neeson who admittedly was embarassed just as he knew his role was his retirement bit. Alec Guinness knew it was nonsense and knew Lucas couldn't direct, but he tutored Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford among others with his professional experience into still putting on a real show. The actors' earnest teamwork in ANH was what made the movie and made fans of us all. While LOTR will be remembered, and not just because of the 17 Oscar wins and astounding efx with many efx you don't even know were efx, the SW prequel will be remembered mainly for the infamous Jar-Jar and Portman's beautiful smiles(admittedly she looks a diamond). McGregor did the best he could with the almost nonexistent scraps of a script and role that he got. Portman is already quoted as saying they tried to do better in filming Ep. III. Apology acknowledged but let's wait and see if Lucas finds some directoral talent somewhere inside himself than the others around him. <br />Even the OT is in danger of fading into obscurity with the weakness of Ewokked ROTJ, and Lucas' refusal to release the original versions, not the ruined special editions where the Death Star(s) has a ST:TheNextGeneration looking explosion and Greedo shoots first. In retrospect, one must suspect the origins of the story of ANH. It is biographical fact Lucas researched Tolkien and LOTR in the months before he came up with the script. That the prequels have had such an uninnovative story, one wonders where Lucas' 9 movie story he boasted about in 1980 exists? The documentaries on starwars.com revealed Lucas was trying to come up with a story for the PM(the challenge of coming up with a story was what the documentary title was.. wonder if it's even on any of the DVD's now or hastily erased) only after he had completed the special editions in 1997(and made us buy yet another efx-enhanced editon and seeing only the special editions in the theaters) while Jackson and crew worked on the script and model sets 5 years before principle filming even started for LOTR. Is it a coincidence we all had to wait so long for sequels yet PM just comes before FOTR? The production for LOTR was already known; Lucas didn't have much time. Finally, interesting in the week before the Oscars, AP news reports the OT , unfortunately special-edition only, was finally coming to DVD. Desperation for more profits? Riding on coattails of a real superior trilogy? Whatever. Interesting how the PM showed opposite the coronation of LOTR at the Oscars on network TV as well. Well, to be fair, an extra star for the things that were done right, mainly the stunt director's lightsabre choreagraphy, stunt work and Ray Park's successful stealing of the movie with his Sith scowl.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|So the film was a slice of life. It was intense. It was well done. And it didn't involve the old guy eventually sleeping with the young girl. Is that what you expected? What you were hoping for in your sordid Hollywood fantasy induced world? Grow up! This film depicted two lonely people in an unfamiliar environment who find this connection that works in translation, but would never hold up in the real world. Did you really expect him to ditch his wife and his kids to stay in Japan with a girl whose husband was due back any minute? The chemistry was there despite the age difference. She would have been responsive if he had made the move. They certainly seemed to have more in common than they did with either of their spouses. But that ain't how life works, buttercup! Sometimes people do the right (and...gasp...unselfish) thing. Sometimes people don't grind out a few minutes of pleasure that may wreck the things they have worked for all of their lives. Sometimes, at the end of the day, two people who want each other madly get to go home to seperate lives, even though it comes close to killing them. Sometimes love is unrequited. And Sophia, Bill and Scarlett show us here that it can still be a beautiful and satisfying thing. These two people get what they need from this experience, heartbreak or no. If you didn't get what you needed from the experience of watching it, some day you may, after a few more trips around the block. And you may want to lay off the Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts love stories in the meantime. It may thrill your heart at the theater but when you reenact the concepts with Fred, the copy guy, at work, or Pam, the Denny's waitress, don't expect your signifigant other to roll over without a fight (or one heck of a divorce settlement).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The standout moment is Dhani Harrison holding back the tears during &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, but the whole show is an uplifting and moving experience.
B000005JA8|1.0|Do not wait too long, do not delay too much.  Do not waste your tmie listening to this contrived album.  Half of the five-star reviews suggest that it was composed and rehearsed in nine hours, and that its &quot;beautiful&quot; lack of form is due to the improvisational nature of the project.  The other half assert that it was carefully rehearsed for a year, and that every single bit of studio noise and ridiculousness was planned.  I have my own theory: this is a giant, steaming pile of garbage.  Here's a question for all of you b-fart fans: how would this album sound different if it was played by pre-school kids?  Answer: exactly the same.  This thing is just jibberish.  The emperor has no clothes.
B0000CFW87|3.0|What I want to know is, why is &quot;Oceano&quot; the only song on this CD that totally kicks ***?  The rest is very mellow and nice, but that song is incredible.  His voice is great, but he doesn't seem to let it go very much.  In the middle of &quot;Oceano&quot;, at the end of the verse, he just lets go and ROARS.  It's an absolutely beautiful moment and left me thinking, &quot;Yeah, I want to hear more of THAT.&quot;  If you're taking requests for your next CD, Josh, please give me just two or three more songs like that.<br />His English songs are a bit too schmaltzy for me, but I can honestly say I never listened to anyone sing in Italian before for longer than 3 seconds, and I love every Italian song he sings.  So he's opened my mind a tiny bit.  (What's next - I sell the minivan?)  <br />It will be interesting to see what he does next.  Maybe he can politely ask David Foster to get his foot off his throat a bit and just blow us all away with the full range of his voice.  I think he's got it in him.
