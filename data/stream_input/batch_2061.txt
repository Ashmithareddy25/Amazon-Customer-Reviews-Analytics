B004K4AVAG|4.0|I was skeptical at first when she came out, wow she really turned me around , now i love her music.<br />I have every CD so far.<br />And she has a great story to tell of her life & how it enfluences a lot of people.
B008S80PCE|5.0|All of Bill Wither's Albums released in one set...a must have collection for any Bill Wither's fan.A lot more hits than you expect. Buy these albums separately and you'll pay a whole lot more.
B000006IUQ|5.0|I've seen the movie before and had to have my own copy to watch whenever I had an attack of cabin fever. The setting is inspiring, the action is stimulating. There are some nice foreshadowing segments and surprises, as well. I could do without some of the crude language, although it's minimal and fits well  with the action - it's not gratuitous. There are a few &#34;I don't think so&#34; parts but I wouldn't change them. They're fun. As a guy, I need to see this movie once a month.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story wasn't what I was expecting, since I haven't seen the movie. Well written. Good adventure. Had to buy the rest of the trilogy.
B006CR2PI0|5.0|This is one of the worst scripted movies ever. But it is still very funny and Demi is so hot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as the first book, &#34;hunger Games&#34;. I'd definitely recommend the entire trilogy to adventure lovers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Clear graphics, intuitive.  Too many ads, but it's to be expected.  Familiar game, easy on the eyes.  Like the autocomplete feature.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the end of the trilogy and wished there were more books in the series. I felt like the story came to a good end, even though there were many casualties along the way.
B0053O89XI|5.0|You couldn't ask for a better comedy series in this day and age!! Easily now my favorite comedy series ever!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it works great on my kindle. I definitely recommend it for kindle fire users and aneroid users.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun tried it after playing a similar one called dragon story, I go back and forth between the two
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a teacher and mother, I found this book an excellent choice. R. J. Palacio masterfully portrays both childrens' and adults' responses to a child who is badly disfigred by multiple congenital disorders. She tells the story from multiple points of view, offering many teaching points. It is amazing how my fourth and fifth grade students relate to the characters in the book. It is epecially touching to see my co-teacher's deaf and hard of hearing students relate to and demonstrate compassion for August. This story elicits such powerful responses from children who otherwise have difficulty relating to characters in books. It has also stimulated powerful conversations about everything from appropriate responses to those who are different, to bullying, to appropriate behavior. I can't wait to see what R. J. Palacio comes up with next and neither can my nine year old son or my 9-11 yeaar old students!<br /><br />I recommend this book to teachers, students, and anyone else who loves a well told story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book.<br />It's a great read and I would recommend this to everyone . Read it now !
B000J103WK|3.0|I specifically ordered 2 of the Eagles: Farewell 1 Tour and instead received the HD DVD.  They were Christmas presents for people who do not have HD DVD equipment.  I would not have been able to return them and get my order back in time for Christmas.  I wish order pullers would pay attention to the orders
B004VSTP4Y|1.0|I loved the first book in the series. The final book however, was terrible. I feel like the author got tired of writing this and just ended it. This was completely lame. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on this.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Plays really well, keeps me entertained. Has one of those 1-3 star ratings for levels. I have this game on my iPod, now I can have it on my phone. Good music and smooth controls. Does get a little monotonous after a while however, but people still play that Angry birds game or whatever, right?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I recommend this for all ages! Trust me this game will last a lifetime!<br /><br />And it is free! Awesome huh?
B00A856U7O|5.0|Thalia is so amazing.<br />The greatest singer of Latin America.<br />every album is incredible and your voice change our hearts
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The book is easy to read - but don't let that fool you.  This book is full of psychological events that will stay with you for a long time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game so far! It's more challenging than the first and the only problem I have with it is that with many of the turns, it's too difficult to see which way you should go so that leaves you crashing into things quite often.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You could never guess the next twist in the book. Couldn't put this book down. I loved how crazy and creative the characters were. Compelling story where you never know which character to hate or love.
0345803507|3.0|The first book was a nice change for a quick, fun read.<br /><br />The second book was mildly entertaining.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed took a few months to finish because it simply wasn't very good. I really felt like I was reading a book I would have read back in high school.  With that said, if you are in your 20's to early 30's this might be more entertaining.  But, if you are already a mature grown up then this book might help put you to sleep at night.  I think a lot of women read these books as an escape but this one is very predictable and blah.
B001TXQN44|5.0|This album brought back so many memories, I forgot how much I loved this band.  What a shame that they could not stay together and make more great music.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I'm not a zombie lover, but my husband and I both fell in love with this show.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, the plot line is intriguing and we can't wait to watch Season 3!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I got rid of this app bc of the constant freezing it did right in the middle of the game. Not only did it freeze when it re-started it wouldnt start from where it left off and still took my coins. I have another bingo game that freezes on occation but as soon as it re-starts itself it goes right back to where the game left off and i lose no coins.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app because I can finally check and send email and view videos instead of logging into my computer. This new updated version is better on both my Kindle Fire & my laptop. So glad Yahoo decided to upgrade!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There are several ways to play makes it a versitile game.  It is challenging and fun.  The music is a little annoying but you can turn it off.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This notebook app allows me to keep track of my personal thoughts and not waste actual paper! I use this app for everything and it has a password lock for anyone like myself that uses it as a personal journal. The beauty about this app is that you can design your notebooks anyway you want, label them, and choose a different type of paper and the word background of that paper. I am happy I found this app by pure mistake! Most treasures are found accidentally!

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very good graphics and very captivating storyline. wish you could play more before purchase but I may consider purchase to finish the game. wish ghat HO games were. 99 or less as it takes time but not $2.99 or more.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the feel of this case and it looks great too.  I was happy with this so I bought one for my husband as well.  In a different color of course.  (The elastic strap also helps hold the stylus in place if you purchase the ones that attach separately.)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is just fantastic - admittedly I love most kinds of sci-fi, but please don't turn your back on this book because it's sci-fi. This is a survival story that is smart, funny, and emotional. One of the best books I've ever read!
B003WTE886|5.0|I am a &#34;new&#34; fan, but bought this after reading reviews.  Quite a talented young woman.  I actually bought 2 at the same time.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|All time best game that helps me to keep my mind sharp and helps in eye hand coordination and concentration.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Had to  purchase this CD after hearing many cuts previously.  I have it in my car and play it constantly!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Everyone should play this game....not just for senior citizens.  It is fun and fills extra time with the same enthusiasm that doing a Bingo scratch-off gives but is free.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|First, I love prog.  Second, I love Yes.  Third, I'm not a Yes \\"purist,\\"  but I do like the era of Tales of Topographic Oceans going back.<br /><br />Fly from here is a nice listen, good for background listening, but really lacks any real punch.  I like it, but wish there was more evidence of Howe and Squire.<br /><br />So I will add it to my collection to listen to time and again.  But it won't crack my regular rotation of Porcupine Tree, Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Gordian Knot, IQ, old Genesis, Squackett, Riverside and others.<br /><br />Overall, somewhere in the middle of all Yes releases, worth listening to time and again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I wish I had this a long time ago when I was working as an artist/teacher. It is the modern day scrapbook of everything you want to remember all in one, concise easy place that is all encompasing.  Everyone should do Pinterest!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter showed me this game and I love it, I play it every chance I get.  A game that definitely challenges my mind.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It has a great plot that pulls you in as you wonder what's going on and how it will end.  The ending is unexpected and perfect.  I plan to read all Blake Crouch's books - you should start with this one - you won't be disappointed in any way.
0547258305|5.0|When I first picked up my copy of Graceling, I half expected it to turn out as yet another fantasy book about a teenage boy with magical powers who finds a beautiful girl and falls in love and eventually marries her, but Graceling was quite a treat.<br /><br />Kristen Cashore introduces you to the Seven Kingdoms with vivid yet realistic descriptions. It is a world in which some people are born with extreme talents. This breed of people are called Gracelings. Katsa, marked with her mismatched eyes, is Graced with fighting. Strong, tough, and hotheaded, she defies gender roles and stays true to herself throughout the book, making for an excellent heroine. But no matter how strong she is, she is still quite awkward, vulnerable, and conflicted. Cashore has brought to life an incredibly realistic character. Held under the reigns of her uncle, King Randa, it is interesting to see Katsa's growth as she battles with the moral dilemmas in her mind.<br /><br />When she meets Prince Po, with one golden colored eye and the other silver, as well as fighting skills nearly on par with hers, Katsa is completely fascinated with him. With Katsa so naive in the field of emotions, it is both amusing and heart wrenching to see their relationship progress.<br /><br />Graceling is a captivating story with dynamic characters. The book is very well paced and is full of many unexpected plot twists. I would often find myself awake at one in the morning crying into my book. While romance is embedded in the story, it does not overwhelm the main plot of the story, a skill many writers nowadays seem to lack. It's actually quite refreshing to see two teenagers set out on a long journey and still not feel obligated to marry and have two kids to carry on their legend. It is a story of action, adventure, corruption, and discovery, and simply put, is a fantastic book.
B007SGM084|5.0|It might not be your typical boy meets girl and they fall madly in love and drive off into the sunset but I think that is what made this such an amazing trilogy. They both learned from each other and changed to be better for the other person as well as themselves. Such an amazing read I would definitely recommend it. Plus you were treated with the awesome dirty details and lets face it who wouldn't want to read that.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Great seller! Prompt delivery! Would recommend to anyone in need of some goods! No need to look elsewhere! This is the spot!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I loved this game and really enjoyed it during the short time that it would work.  I even downloaded it twice hoping the first time just had a glitch.  I was able to use it one day each time then I got the message that &#34;My Horse has stopped working&#34;.  It was very irritating that it wouldn't work so I deleted it the second time also.  It's a really fun game if it worked.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|its exciting and completely different from the original. I love how you can sit in a cart now. everything looks less animated and more &quot;real&quot; in this version too. all I can say is wow!
B000002GKT|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing this band in Santa Monica in 1975 in what was billed as their last live performance in the US. I had the album for years & recorded it on a cassette. Played them both to death. Great original band with huge talent. Highly recommended!

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I remember the original Dark Shadows from the 1960's when it was kinda like a soap opera and came on everyday for 30 minutes and it was good.. and the 1990's version wasn't bad either.. I did like this version of Dark Shadow even though it was more comedy that the dark horror that was once Dark Shadows.. But still a good movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins was really good.

B00AZMFO6I|4.0|\\"Quartet\\" (2012 release; 97 min.) is not to be confused with that other recent classical music-themed movie called \\"A Late Quartet\\" (more on that later). This movie brings the story of Beecham House, a place in England that is \\"Home for Retired Musicians\\", but more accuratly very gifted musicians. All is well at Beecham House until the arrival of a new retiree, Jean Horton (played by Maggie Smith), once a very famous operetta singer. On top of that, also living at Beecham House is her ex-husband of many years ago, Reginald \\"Reg\\" Paget (played by Tom Courtenay). The annual gala (providing much needing funds for the continuing existance of Beecham House) is coming up, and the question is whether Jean and Reg, along with Wilf (played by Billy Connolly) and Cissy (played by Pauline Collins) will reunite as a quartet from many years ago to bring Verdi's Rigoletto.<br /><br />Several comments: noteworthy, this is the debut of Dustin Hoffman as a director. Why it has taken him this long to go beyond the camera I don't know, but better late than never (hey, he's a spring chicken at a mere mid-70s!). The acting performances are a delight pretty much from start to finish, even with Maggie Smith playing a mostly unlikable character (Jean is a \\"prima donna\\" for most of the movie, pining for her golden years of success and asking herself \\"why do we have to get old?\\"). The movie is correctly billed as a comedy-drama. When it stays light-hearted, the movie plays great, but when it goes for the drama angle, the movie falters badly, and the end of the movie is utterly predictable. (But stay for the end credits! We get to see who among those at Beecham House in the movie were real-life musicians and what they did back then. One of the best surprises of the movie.)<br /><br />The proof is in the pudding: when I saw it in the theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend, the audience (of mostly seniors, I might add) lapped it up with chuckles and all-out laughter during the lighter moments of the movie (typical example: Reg reminisces to Jean 'I took 12 curtain calls' to which Jean immediately replies 'no you didn't, you took 9 and I took 12'). In the end, the movie was fine but it doesn't make a lasting impression. This is in contrast to that other recent quartet movie I mentioned (\\"A Late Quartet\\", starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christopher Walken), which I absolutely loved. That aside, classical music is front and center in both these movies, so if you're not into classical music, save yourself the trouble.of the movie (typical example: Reg reminisces to Jean 'I took 12 curtain calls' to which Jean immediately replies 'no you didn't, you took 9 and I took 12').

Another thing, the tilt sensitivity. it is slow and hard to control. sometimes the swipes don't even register. once these bugs are fixed thug game will he perfect.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I watched the A-Team the day before so I was excited to see \\"the avengers\\" thinking it would also be an action adventure movie. A lot of the movie has that comic book-esque lighting to make everything look a little mysterious. For me that was a big detraction from enjoying the movie. Other than this all the movie was very good.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I like this app and there is no doubt some instruction reading would need to be done.  The only bad thing is there are no short cuts to get to what you need, like just making a simple note.  I used this for extensive lists...like building a christmas list throughout the year and other things I would need to edit too much.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|you get addicted 5 minutes after watching, I recommend walking dead to all. I can't wait for the next season to come out.
1451675046|5.0|This book contains what you should have learned in Science class.<br />It is outstand and easy to read. A must read if you want updated about<br />the universe.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|To be truthful this book was a little dry compared to the others. It had its moments but for the most part I wasn't going crazy about it. I think it would have been better if she did the entire book from his prospective like she started towards the end but I'm not a writer by any means. It was a great series though, I wish there were more.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|The movie can be watched over and over, a worthwhile purchase for continued entertainment. We love it as a family movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was amazing.. I could not put it down..Can't wait to read the last one. The book was really a great read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the movie so I thought it was time to read the book. it is so much better :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I liked this standard solitaire game because the graphics. ease of card movements. and card size are all so easy on my eyes.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|enter your facebook on another and do that the same device now it says that someone else log on to your facebook account now. delete app on a another device that you want switch. now sign your facebook facebook on that device congratulations you swiched
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the way this game gets progressively harder. but it would be nice if more combinations were available to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever. I can not stop playing it. If you are thinking about buying this game. Do it. It rocks.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version of mahjong has an excellent level of challenge, graphics, and clarity that is easy on the eyes and fun for the brain.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|movie was a long one but  every minute was packed with suspense and action. excellent acting! Thankfully Marla maples trump had a small acting part. And by the way--Halle Berry looked 'drop-dead' gorgeous!!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I have heard that this game is a lot of fun to play for all ages, but we could not get it to do anything on our tablet.
B00003CY5J|3.0|movie itself was slow,dark and drawn out way past the ability of the plot to carry it. If u like DeNiro then get it, otherwise u could probably skip this one
B008220D5K|4.0|Rather liked this movie. A little hard to watch some parts, a little aimless in others, but prompted some outright guffaws in some parts. An interesting slice of not always pretty life. Those who are at that stage of life will definitely recognise pieces of their lives here
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|Only so so. It doesn't have all the songs I wanted. Long live Whitney Houston in our hearts! We'll see you again one day.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This app is worth the price. The level of graphic detail is overkill in my opinion.<br /><br />I would give the app 5 stars if it made multi-player easier. Local multi-player rooms are destroyed after every game and there is no way to keep score within the app across multiple games.
B001F12J48|5.0|We love this movie. The kids have had the best time watching it this Christmas. I will say that the 3D glasses that come with the movie aren't really good ones. I tried to watch it with the glasses on and I had to stop. It was really weird looking. This came with the 3D DVD and the regular DVD. SO we just threw the glasses away and just watch the regular version.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is very well designed for a touch interface.<br /><br />It allows you to easily to connect and transfer files between:<br />1. local network resources (such as folder shares on windows pcs)<br />2. FTP sites<br />3. Cloud sharing services such as dropbox, gdrive, skydrive, s3, sugarsync and more.<br /><br />Access to the fire's camera and a built in video player are also included.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is one of the most life changing books I have read. Read it for yourself & make your own decision. The changes in my body since I stopped eating wheat are amazing!! Have not felt deprived at all.<br />Easy to understand & the background as to why wheat reacts the way it does in your body is an eye opener.
1936594234|5.0|A fascinating journey through the untold power of our minds. For centuries there have been accounts of healings & surgeries done without anesthesia. The author describes, through countless stories, how we are self contained creatures with the ability to do anything we can imagine. Very empowering and hopeful news in the midst of troubling times.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable works great just like the original did.  I also like that it was very inexpensive and was shipped so quickly.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We are hooked on this series, what a great program. We have already ordered season 3 to go along with our collection.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Her music is always great.  These songs were not very familiar, but enjoyable just the same.  Would recommend especially is you are a Streisand fan.
1426209584|5.0|The illustrations are spectacular and the history is fascinating. For such a book, the $32 was quite reasonable. It's nice to have a new genuine coffee table book to put in the living room once every few years.
B0060ANY16|3.0|I picked this album up after Pandora played a track (Greg Allman's) on one of my stations.  I have always been a fan of the ABB, Trucks/Tedschi and that genre of music.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this album is to relate it to a live concert.  Typically when I go to a live show before the main act comes on you hear some back ground music.  Then the main act comes on and does their sets, then the show ends and the back ground music starts again.<br />That's how I hear this album.  You have some really good background music for the first couple of tracks.  Then Greg Allman comes on and lays some great blues backed up by a great band , DT and company.  Then the shows over and you go back to the background music.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, the band is great, but its really just a jam session.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|fun. and. challenging. game I had to use the hint a bit when I got stuck. but the story line and graphics are very googg over all a very good game
B009K0P10K|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Emily VanCamp's performances over the years.  Revenge reminds me a bit of Alias.  Enjoying the show - keep it coming!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the app.It is even better than the first temple run.You should get the app.It was the best app I ever got.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I obviously saw this movie knowing beforehand it was nowhere near bound to be an academy award winner; the idea was to watch something funny and have a little laugh. It's somewhat ok, everything exaggerated, but you do get to see real truths about the so vaguely mentioned \\"democracy\\" that we hear everywhere.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Ok some people think is is a good app is it???? No because if u had this app and like me if u revive with a jewel and the game freezes it scams me it's has not been working right other than that it's a ok app I would recommend it but not to much Times because of this glitch I've listed about10 jewel s because of it.happy sigh green
B005FISC52|5.0|It was a great deal and just what I wanted. Came well packaged and ready to watch. Awesome buy for One Tree Hill Shows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|all the ipods and ipads got updates, why haven't the kindle fires got it yet? does any one know? please tell me if u know!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now I am caught up and current with the series and loving it! I would recommend this to anyone !!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Would you like a mix of &#34;Stand by Me,&#34; &#34;The Goonies,&#34; and &#34;E.T.,&#34; all with a nice dollop of nostalgia? You're welcome.<br /><br />Oh, and the Blu-ray transfer is very nice.
B000000WFZ|5.0|It is hard to imagine that this is the same composer whom made the music for many spagetti westerns including- &#34;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&#34;.  This album/soundtrack is very diverse and holds a special place for me because, although already having seen the movie, I came across the soundtrack on a cassett tape while I was in Guatemala  working as a Peace Corps volunteer.  It was the soundtrack of my life at the time.  Beautiful music.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Very nice Blu-ray with good sound and picture. The extra features were nice, as well as the ability to watch extended episodes easily. Good buy.
B003XRELEI|5.0|I've been a fan for twenty something years, I love the way that he thought- and wrote.  It was a sad day when he shuffled from this mortal coil.
034580404X|3.0|It was recommended I am broadminded but was a bit explicit drawn out-- 2 books would have been fine.I havent recommended any of my friends buy it
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The characters and costumes are so beautifully done.  Can watch the segments over and over again because I always catch something that I didn't notice before.  It's close to history but not boring at all.
0765325950|5.0|This was an excellent ending to one of the best fantasy series ever written.  The story does an amazing job of pulling together all the different story lines that have interwoven the previous novels.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was very interesting couldn't put it down. Enjoyed reading it! Wasn't what I expected at all. Hope their are more for the story line later.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Good followup and makes you want to go for more. Enjoyable fun for light reading. Got the remainder in old fashioned book form though.  need it physically in my hands to relax.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a great movie and great deal.  I paid $10 less on Amazon than purchasing it from a retail store.  However the digital copy is a hassle to acquire, in which you have to use a special app to access and view.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What can I say about this book; the entire series so far has just about everything.  A definite must read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun, hard<br />complicated. easy. cool. enjoyable. sweet. rocking. desirable. awesome. nice. kool. rocking. I enjoy it a lot
B007PT1PEY|5.0|It was fun to read and slowed me down due to the difference in the \\"old\\" or English style of writing versus today's American style (I'm not quite sure of the proper name of the different styles). Having not read any of Doyle's works, I'd always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes just from hearing bits and pieces as I was growing up. To find a collection of his stories was perfect.
0875428940|5.0|Easy to read/use. Great visuals.  Not so much on the so called instructions, but there are plenty of sources on the internet.  It's a matter of your own intuition anyway.
B009O07NDY|5.0|A must have for any film score lover, or fan of Middle Earth. You will recognize some musical themes from  the Trilogy scores, and be delighted by the new themes specific to The Unexpected Journey.<br />The 2 disc packaging is beautiful, with a lovely booklet that brings to life the recording process.  It is well worth buying the physical media over a digital download.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app! It is so easy to use and it is remarkable for deleting spam e-mails!!! It is an absolute must for the Kindle Fire!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved breaking dawn when part 2 was conning out and it was a lot of different things from the book and the movies
B008HK3XKO|2.0|it won't keep kindle standing. no matter what i do it falls. slides down flat. doesn't do what its supposed to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is as wonderful as I anticipated! Can't stop watching this show! Shirley McClain is marvelous as Cora's mother...full cast are still fresh and charming (or devious) as ever...
B006KX3GXO|5.0|New update was wonderful. So happy they added an eraser for my doodles, plus there's now a huge variety of things to use!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I downloaded. Installed and looked and it had identified the WDTV unit on my wifi network. Clicked the icon and we were off and running. Unbelieveable.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Possibly the best Rock&Roll band ever; if not, then they share that honor with only a handful of musicians who influenced music in their generation and for decades after their prime. This belongs in your collection. I bought it because I wore out the original vinyl albums long ago.
B005HGZVEM|5.0|Chris Isaak sounds like a cross between Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, so this collection of Sun Records recordings is a perfect fit for the crooner. Even if you don't hear a lot of differences, it is still great to experience modern sound on classics like &#34;Ring of Fire,&#34; &#34;Can't Help Fallling in Love&#34; and &#34;Great Balls of Fire.&#34; But the differences are there and Isaak's voice never sounded better. Turns out Sun Records owner really liked Isaak's work, too, even before this project came along.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|kept you guessing right to the end highly recommend very well written and great set of characters before l go to sleep
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This product arrived as promised and expected. Am currently watching the entire Spartacus series. It is nice to have all three seasons to watch from beginning to end.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Its very challenging and give you mine a good exercise with different levels of difficulty, great to keep focus and can take it any where
B003PIUC02|5.0|This product arrived as promised.  I am now able to watch the complete series when I have time and at a pace that works with my schedule.
B007EDYN36|4.0|I really liked this book.  Seems to be pretty honest and open. Yes he blames the others for a lot but also takes<br />some of the blame himself.  Everyone knows what an egomaniac Gene is...but the way they (other band members & management) screwed so many people over was eye opening. I believe it- money & greed are very powerful.<br />Glad Peter put his life together.  Read this book in 2 days, enjoyed it a lot.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This arrived as expected.  It is great to have the complete season and watch it without worrying about missing an episode.
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this book on my kindle because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about.<br />I read it, but i found it difficult to finish.  I could find no plot, no depth to the story, it´s just.... porn!!<br />After this, my husband gave me the trilogy as a gift because they told him in Miami that it was the world¨s best seller!!<br />And it is,....sadly it is.<br />I really can´t believe that a book like this is read everywhere and so many women give it positive reviews.<br />It teaches us nothing, (except all the terms in S&M), it gives us nothing!!<br />I know that those who are not twilight fans don´t have many good things to say about it, but at least they teach us some values: the value of family, love, of temperance and sacrifice in not drinking human blood.(i say this because there somehow people talk about this two books)<br />Instead, this book really is just porn.<br />I will not read the 2 other volumes, i rather spend my time reading about zombies!<br />(sorry about my spelling, english is my second language)
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are solitaire games and then there is this one.  Works much better and is easier to use that any before.  I play this for hours, at the beach, on the sofa.  Everyone knows tv is a vast wasteland now.  Reach for solitaire.
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|This was working perfectly, but now requires a computer restart in order for the sound to work. Other than that slight annoyance works great and is very useful.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|this is definately a needed program on a kindle as it allows you easy access to all your files and programs
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a very well written book. The characters draw you in to the point that you're almost able to feel their pain. I'd like to see a follow-up of Hopeless.... to see where these characters are say... 10 years down the road.
0385341008|5.0|I just loved this book, I couldn't let it down and am now recommending it to friends of mine who are also avid readers of good books
0871164566|5.0|love this book. best on the subject I have found. Will enjoy working with this one, wish there was a sequel
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As the series gets darker, I find it is more addictive than ever . Every time you think the situation can't get worse it does. And the characters (that survive ) seem to grow into the new demands. great story and performances!
B005HF1CMI|5.0|Excellent well scripted and good cast I would highly recommend to anyone who like Law and Order, Criminal mind or Mentalist.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy using trajectory analysis in solving problems.<br />This game also relies on reflexes and touch.<br />Can be very time consuming.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm not saying this book will make your marriage work or not, but it really does help you see what your wife/husband needs are. This is a great read for singles and couples alike. It has certainly helped me going forward.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is is twice the fun of the original. The winding path and added obstacles such as the rope and rail road cart add a whole new dimension to the game. The graphics look excellent and the controls are very responsive. You will want to play over and over to get all the upgrades...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series...it is like reading a great novel!  It has Characters with integrity and a very interesting storyline.
B007T967X4|5.0|Great App, Will help you to read the notes in time and makes you concentrate on where the notes are on the violin finger board.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|\\"Ceremonials\\" is an album full of haunting grace and beauty. This is one of those albums that you want to just sit down and get completely lost in--and you can. The songs here are absolutely wonderful, and I love every one of them. They move me and make me imagine fantastic worlds. The stories they tell come through loud and clear, as if I were there in person. In short, \\"Ceremonials\\" is a stunning piece of work.
0316066524|5.0|Yes, you will probably need to look up words in a dictionary, on average, two per page (by the end of my reading, I had 35 pages' worth of words that I had never seen before, including \\"fantods,\\" \\"gibbous,\\" and \\"tumescent.\\"); yes, there will be pages that make you want to vomit because they are simply so verbose and contain very little punctuation that your head basically spins if you don't give yourself the pauses you need to breathe(one gets the impression that Wallace got himself into a rhythm when drafting this book); and yes, you will probably re-read paragraphs over and over again in order to understand the full meaning of them. Without doubt, the reading of this book takes effort (the appendices are a book in themselves, for Pete's sake!).<br /><br />Yet, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that the struggle is worth it.<br /><br />There are many wonderful lessons to be gained from reading this book and many touching scenes that you are likely to reflect upon periodically for days, maybe even months, after you've read the book (as of this writing, I finished the book about two weeks ago). There are also some very funny moments. As Dave Eggers who wrote the introduction to this book reflected of his own experience, it is possible you might even come away from this book feeling like you're somehow a better person (whether it's because you've learned some new words or you've achieved a level of insight that you might not have had before!)! Whatever the case may be, this book has something for everyone and plenty of it to go around.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book. Sky is a very intelligent girl that handles problems in a very mature way. The story is exceptional and shows how important it is to live and be happy -- do not live in the past but accept challenges for the future.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even better than the original and with great graphics! plus its FREE. definatley recommend this to anyone!:) temple run 2 is AMAZING!!
B0010358CQ|5.0|The movie came on time.  It was a great movie.  I wish they would make a trilogy.  I look forward to watching more anime movies.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I got this CD for one song, ended up loving all of them!! Their high energy and stick in your head
B0096DZKZC|1.0|I haven't played my nephew ordered this without my permission. As preivously stated my grandaughter and nephew made orders without my permission while palying with my kindle
B0059XTUB8|5.0|This is a fantastic film. After watching it through NetFlix, I just knew I needed to add it to my collection. It made for a great movie night with friends, and I'm sure I'll watch it over and over.
0811836363|5.0|READING NICE, GOOD HISTORY OF THE BEATLES AND VERY WELL PICTURED. Good pictures, good stuff.  I urge all Beatlemaniacs! Very good.
B004GYY714|5.0|My 'local&#34; NPR doesn't reach quite far enough to hear it clearly at home, and so this is a perfect boost so that I can hear all of my local state news instead of tuning into to the boosted NPR from our neighboring state.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it's an alright game, but I personally hate the XP and energy things where you can't do anything without enough energy.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is fantastic to have season 3 several episodes before it finishing airing on PBS. This has been a sad season so far, but receiving the DVDs in perfect condition made my night a bit happier.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I didn't want a otter box type cover so this was my first attempt at finding one. Very satisfied with this product. Looks nice and protects it for my use (in house usage only.) I have not yet figured out how to use the stand. Smells a bit strange but expect that to dissipate with time. Would recommend for adult users of kindle fire.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch Castle on TV, one of my favorites.  This book is a bit different than the TV program, but just as good.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It brings the fond memories of childhood back and you can almost feel it when you read the story.<br />As you laugh about a time that you did something like the pranks that was told about in this wonderful story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. All his books are wonderful. It will keep on your toes the entire time. Must read this book
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This book will keep you reading until you reach the end. I also  makes you think about how the things that you do May impact on others and on your oneself.
B005LAII80|5.0|Put simply, \\"Dredd\\" is great action movie with a simple but satisfying plot.  Below the surface, it provides interesting social commentary on the justice system and absolutism in the face of the absurd, but the viewer is not struck over the head with such concerns. I saw \\"Dredd\\" in the theater in September after being intrigued by the trailer and was not disappointed.  The visual effects are extremely well done, and it features a good amount of deadpan humor that actually made me laugh aloud.  Thematically it can be compared to some of the more famous films about the Vietnam War, as the plot line of \\"Dredd\\" is really a \\"just another day\\" scenario for the characters.  The pacing is good, there are no blatant logical absurdities, the tone is consistent, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, all of which were huge problems in \\"Django Unchained.\\"  Despite very good critical and fan reviews, this movie failed to make an impact at the box office and only ran for a few weeks.  I've seen it four or five times since purchasing the movie, and it seems to be selling quite robustly.  Maybe we'll even get a sequel that rewards the work of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby if it continues to sell well, but at the very least, \\"Dredd\\" is destined to become a cult-classic alongside \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"The Boondock Saints.\\"  Be the one to introduce this film to your friends...
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is A great app but I Can't Get 0.6.0<br />Please Get 0.6.0<br />Minecraft Pocket Edition is Great<br />It like Lego<br />But 3D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I Love  This App<br />BEST APP EVER
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Recommended by my family member.  Makes an individual think about the proper routing to keep lines from potential crossings and encourages thinking before plunging right into the attempt to solve.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|It wasn't as entertaining as Step 1 and Step 2.<br />I thought it was a little boring it probably didn't hold my interest.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Great modern era Dylan.  Obviously he'll never touch some of his early stuff (e.g. Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks).  Even he's admitted that what he was writing in those days was something special that he can't re-produce.  However he still puts out some amazing work.  I've loved to watch his evolution in his later years.  This album does a great job mixing his more recent, dark style with his amazing storytelling capabilities.  Some of the longer tracks on this album are amazing and will take you back to some of the older stuff.  They tell deep twisted stories that get better each time you hear them as you uncover new pieces.  A must have if you love Dylan and a good buy even if somehow you've never listened to a Dylan album before.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|He loves it! This band is fantastic. It was exactly as expected. Not many bands out there like this one.
B00002N9ER|5.0|This bracket provides a easy way of staying organized in the home office vehicle or wherever else you see fit. The flashlight is always right there when you need it.
B000FC1MOQ|2.0|I wanted to like this book, especially having enjoyed others in the niche. But, the writing style is so bizarre, with odd capitalisation and no use of speech marks (at all!) that one is constantly reminded one is reading a book, rather than enjoying reading a book.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Versatile app allows both children and adults to indulge their creative urges without needing a tutorial or a lot of innate talent.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Very clever and imaginative. The editing and pacing are excellent and really help pull into the story. However, due to the nature of that story, this movie is really only worth watching once.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the only Amazon \\"Special Offers\\" Kindle Title I have ever purchased, and hopefully it doesn't ruin the prospects of any to come. I had no expectations or knowledge of this book prior to downloading but was hooked instantly. The characters are great but not too overly detailed. The environment and description is well written and makes your mind wonder through the space. There are twists and turns just as often as the main staircase so often traveled in the books. The science and thoughts are sound and remind me of Crichton with their possibility.<br /><br />Bottom line - this is an amazing set of stories which will hold your attention like a vise and leave you satisfied when it finally lets go. If you have hesitations, I encourage you to try a sample of the first book - you will certainly make the decision to purchase before you are through. I am now going to explore the rest of the reads Mr. Howey has with eager anticipation.
B0015AARJI|5.0|muchas gracias amigo estoy muy contento y satifecho con el producto era mejor de lo q esperba se lo recomiendo a ojos cerrado
B005MZIF4Q|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT AS LISTED. FAST SHIPPING. GREAT PRICE. ALL AROUND GREAT TRANSACTION THANK YOU FOR PROMPT SHIPPING AND QUALITY PRODUCT,
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can only read so much postings and it stops to where I am not able to view earlier postings.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I don't really use it very much. I get on my phone and I am able to view the videos faster and easier. I really only use my kindle for reading my books. I have enjoyed having my kindle but not so much for the games.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book is horrible YOU CANT FIND NOTHING THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better graphics than the first and I like the idea of the gems. As addicting as the original game!!! I love it!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how Katniss and Peeta were supposed to be in love and Katniss was just acting I really did think she loved him.

B008MF3OEY|4.0|There are many types of covers and holders for the various models of the first generation Kindle fire, but this [[ASIN:B008MF3OEY Verso Prologue Marbled Blue Cover]] adds the look and feel of a rare book to this device. For those looking for a highly protective cover for everyday use, this one may not be the best choice, but it's a good cover with a lot to like about it.<br /><br />The Verso Prologue Marbled Cover looks more attractive than the images shown here, and it looks like it would be right at home on a bookshelf, where mine is right now. The faux leather and antique foil stampings add to it's overall good looks, and the elastic straps in each corner hold my first generation [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] better than initially expected when it was first received. Those elastic straps do cover the stereo speaker ports, but there didn't seem to be any loss of sound quality when I played a few music tracks and video selections... a pleasant surprise. The microfiber interior is a nice touch.<br /><br />A small plus to this cover it that it has a handy inside pocket, which is the right size for stowing a couple business cards or receipts you may pick up if you're out and about with your Kindle Fire. It should be noted that when first received, there's a small magnetic card that comes inside this pocket, and as noted in the directions, this should be discarded.<br /><br />There is one strong point that many covers lack, and it's that it holds my [[ASIN:B008MOHLVC amPen New Hybrid Stylus]] in the binding edge when closed, which adds to its overall usefulness when used on a regular basis. This stylus has a short lanyard that plugs into the headphone port when it's not in use, and there's just enough length where it fits neatly and quite handily. It also fits easily into the [[ASIN:B006ZT4VA0 AmazonBasics Portable Fold-Up Travel Stand]] when reading.<br /><br />As noted above, it may not be the most protective cover for the Kindle Fire. For that purpose it's hard to beat the well-proven [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand]], which is far more utilitarian, especially when traveling. The downside to this one is that it lacks a place to keep the stylus if you use one.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B008MF3OEY Verso Prologue Marbled Blue Cover]] is a good one for those who want a classic book appearance. It's well-crafted, light in weight and quite sturdy, and if you use a stylus, being able to store it within the binding edge makes up for whatever protection shortcomings one might find.<br /><br />1/31/2012beat the well-proven [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand]], which is far more utilitarian, especially when traveling.

B00B4AFPJ6|4.0|Luminescent bounce<br />Eye candy effects aglow<br />Spark ignites my soul<br /><br />This game is simple, ethereal, strategic and fun. Reflect and bounce your luminous spark through the maze, avoid obstacles, collect diamonds, and bounce out the exit. Tap to change mirror directions and alter your spark's trajectory.<br /><br />Easy concept, smooth controls, challenging levels. This requires strategy and problem solving; keeps the mind sharp, yet is simple enough for anyone to enjoy.<br /><br />Neon graphics really POP off the screen. It's extra fun to crank up the screen brightness, turn off the room lights, and immerse myself in the light show. Very intoxicating; almost trance-like and meditative. Really takes me away.<br /><br />Spark effects can occasionally stutter on my LG Marquee, but are smooth as silk on my Thrive tablet. Played well on a friend's Kindle Fire too. Very nice quality HD style graphics. Veritable eye candy.<br /><br />There's 40 levels of eye-popping luminescent fun, so this ought to hold my interest for quite a while. Good twists and turns as it goes on. This one will be fun to go back and re-play completed levels. Nice freestyle type game play.<br /><br />Sound FX and Music ain't half bad and adds to the mystical experience, though I tend to turn the volume down a tad and try to just get lost in the light show. Quite nice. Soothing. Interesting mood-bender. Doesn't get me amped up or anxious like some other games can.<br /><br />Great just before bed. Helps me wind down and get ready to drift off to sleep. There's something really mesmeric about this one.<br /><br />Bottom Line -- one of my fave new games to come along in awhile. Permissions are a bit iffy for a game; phone state, ID, etc, but it's really a trippy, zippy, fun and unique game. Like this one a lot! Glowingly Happy! ;oD

B0000029DD|5.0|I recently became more aware of Jeff Buckley's music.  Sure I heard his rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Halleujah\\", how he refined it and perhaps made it his own, as did Hendrix borrow of Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watch Tower\\".  So, my wife bought 'Grace'.  My God, what musical power and well, Grace!  Sure his vocal talent is great, a unique rock, cabaret, and even sensual soul crooner.  But, even without vocals, his music shows unique expertise.  Just the guitar hooks in the rock bangers like \\"Eternal Life\\" and the musical arrangments are superb.  Thirty seconds of the beginning of \\"So Real\\" just makes the 90s and 00's music output pale in comparison.  The band must commended for producting a great and enduring work.  I could go on, but I rather pay attention to \\"Dream Brother\\" that is playing right now.  Should you get this CD or MP3? Yes.  Will you like it?  You'll learn to like it.  And, if you dig into the biography and associated info, the songs may also bring a tear everyone once in a while.

B0012TUPRQ|5.0|I purchased this along with the RAM Square 2-inch x 1.7-inch base with 1-inch ball, and the Universal X-Grip Holder.  As I am using this as a part of a system, I will comment on the overall package as the parts are all of the same high quality and would be useless alone.<br /><br />Although I've only had it installed for a day, I could not be any more pleased.  For reference, this is mounted on the dash of my 2003 Jeep Wrangler.<br /><br />After going through countless cheap (under $5) car holders, mounts, etc., I finally had enough after purchasing an iOttie mount for around $15 only to have it break after 6 months of usage.  Sure, it is plastic, and $15 isn't a lot of money in the big picture, but I need more than 6 months from a product.<br /><br />I looked into several different mounting options including custom mounts, and fortunately came across RAM products.  I read the reviews, looked into the company itself, and quickly ordered a solution that seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.  I am happy to say so far, I made the right decision.<br /><br />I mounted the base to the center area of my Wrangler's dash, in a place that is covered by a removable rubber mat, and the screw holes can easily be covered up if someone decided to remove the mount for some reason (likely me, in order to keep it for my next vehicle!).  This lets me angle the rest of the mount above the radio and vent, which I find to be the best location for navigation and music control.<br /><br />The X-Grip connects to the socket arm and can be adjusted to almost any position.  The X-Grip, if centered, does hit the volume/power buttons of my Nexus 4 if centered, but I find that positioning it to either side still provides an extremely secure grip and avoids hitting the buttons.<br /><br />I obviously cannot speak to durability, but all 3 of the parts that I ordered appear to use high quality metals and plastics.  The points that would be prone to failure due to sun/heat are sturdy enough that I will be amazed if it breaks, and considering RAM Mount's reputation I have a feeling I shouldn't worry.  I will certainly come back and edit my review should that happen, but I trust RAM would take care of me even in the event<br /><br />All said, I spent around $40 for the 3 pieces.  I have probably spent that much in cheap plastic mounts in the past 3 years.  I have no doubt that I could easily be using this 15 years down the road.  Past the 15 year point, we will probably have all of our gadgets implanted in our brains, but I bet the plastic in this mount will still be solid!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does everything you expect. Although it would be nice if it stayed on at night to show the time...but then I suppose the battery would drain quickly on my Kindle Fire

B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Worded with my media system (Samsung TV, Sony AVR, and Serviio Media Server running on an Ubuntu machine) on my Kindle fire.
038572179X|5.0|I was familiar with Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" due to [[ASIN:B0017W8ODK the 2007 film adaptation]], and even though I still haven't seen it in its entirety, my interest was piqued enough by the trailer that I picked up the novel after spotting it at my local second-hand book store. Dealing with themes such as love, war, truth, storytelling, guilt and (obviously) atonement, I found the novel to be quite gripping and had it read over the course of four nights. A passage quoted from Jane Austen's [[ASIN:1604597348 Northanger Abbey]] (a story in which a young woman's overactive imagination nearly costs her all her happiness) sets the mood for \\"Atonement\\", though it's not the protagonist's happiness that is at stake, but that of her sister's.<br /><br />Briony Tallis is thirteen years old at the onset of the story, a precocious, oversensitive and bossy girl with a hyperactive imagination and ambitions to become a writer, looking forward to the return of her adored older brother to the family estate. It is her plan to perform a play for his benefit, one that she's written herself, roping in her newly arrived cousins to play the various parts. Meanwhile, her old sister Cecelia and the charwoman's son Robbie Turner are just beginning to work out the depth of their mutual attraction to each other, leading to several encounters in the house and grounds.<br /><br />It is Briony who catches glimpses of them together, misinterpreting their interactions and concluding that Robbie is threatening her sister. By the end of the night, Briony will have committed a terrible crime, one she'll spend the rest of her life atoning for.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts: part 1 recounts hours leading up to the crime from the viewpoints of various characters; part 2 is a unbroken description (that is, there are no chapter breaks) of the Dunkirke evacuation as experienced by Robbie, part 3 details a grown Briony's efforts as a nurse in the war, and part 4 leaps forward in time to 1999, where Briony as an old woman returns to her childhood home and looks back over the years. This, the only part written in first-person narration, sheds further light over what the reader has just experienced, and provides a new perspective of the events that make up the novel.<br /><br />McEwan captures a vivid sense of time and place, from the crumbling grandeur of the Tallis family home and the hot summer that preceded WWII, to the blood, grime, sweat and horror of Dunkirke. The swelter and languor of the first part provides a shocking contrast when we're plunged right into the middle of the evacuation, and though this segment of the novel is one solid block of writing, it's nearly impossible to put the book down as Robbie and his compatriots struggle toward the French coast.<br /><br />Though there are themes aplenty, McEwan seems especially interested in the power and persuasiveness of storytelling. Briony is driven to write all about the world around her, and the growth that she exhibits throughout the novel is very much linked to her growing maturity as a writer. A key moment is when she realizes that writing can be more than simple morality plays, but involve an exploration of people's minds:<br /><br />\\"There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It was only scheming and wickedness that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.\\"<br /><br />This epiphany informs the rest of Briony's life, as well as the book itself. In her search for inspiration, her still-maturing mind misconstrues what's really happening between Robbie and Cecelia, leading to her making false accusations against him. She grows up in the war years, becoming a nurse and tending to the wounded soldiers, but always in the back of her mind is knowledge of the grief that she brought to Robbie and her sister, having come to realize from an adult's perspective what was really happening between them. And so she attempts to atone for her past... or does she?  The final part of the novel presents yet another point-of-view of the events in question, and the reader is left to ponder Briony's actions and motivations. Did she make a genuine attempt at making amends to the people she wronged the only way she knows how, or is she selfishly and cowardly attempting to rewrite history and cover up her own actions to make herself feel better, hiding behind atonement as her justification all the while?<br /><br />Each character is carefully drawn - some unnecessarily, as I was never quite sure why we needed an in-depth look at Emily's migraines - but open for interpretation and debate. Cecelia and Robbie's sexual tension is palatable; it's just a shame that their love story is not quite so convincing. Of course, that's not really the point. Contrary to a lot of the book's publicity (especially regarding the release of the movie) the lovers are not the protagonists. Still, I never really felt the pain of Robbie and Cecilia's separation when perhaps I should have - that after all, is what Briony spend the entire book feeling guilty about. There's no lingering sense of \\"what might have been\\" between them after that brief encounter in the library.<br /><br />Furthermore, to make his story work, McEwan has to rely on some stretches of logic. I found it hard to believe that the police would rest a case on the testimony of a child known to be over-imaginative, or that the family didn't protest the innocence of a man they had known since childhood. Didn't Cecelia have anything to say in Robbie's defence? Couldn't the twins account for his whereabouts? Was the victim herself ever interviewed? Not even McEwan can explain the unlikelihood of Robbie's conviction, as he skips straight from Robbie's arrest to his days in the war.<br /><br />It was with some interest that I read through some of the negative reviews. The most common complaints are that \\"Atonement\\" took too long to get moving, that there was a lack of moral certitude, that the characters were unlikeable and that there was a sense of being cheated over the last-act \\"twist.\\" All are viable points to make, though it seems as though some people would have rather been reading \\"The Trials of Arabella\\", Briony's first play, in which good is rewarded, crimes are punished, and there is a neat, happy ending. McEwan eschewers this idea, instead presenting a complex and ambiguous set of circumstances that require the reader to make up their own mind as to what is true or false, good or bad, real or imaginary. Real life is messy and confusing; it's through our fiction that we try to gain some measure of meaning or control over it; as Briony did.e war years, becoming a nurse and tending to the wounded soldiers, but always in the back of her mind is knowledge of the grief that she brought to Robbie and her sister, having come to realize from an adult's perspective what was really happening between them.

B008YCMM2A|5.0|'Live in Europe 1969' contains four (nearly) complete shows from the so-called Lost Quintet, aka the Third Great Quintet, which features Wayne Shorter on sax, Chick Corea on piano, Dave Holland on bass, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. This group never actually made an album together as a quintet, though they did all appear on 1970's 'Bitches Brew,' which Miles would begin recording less than a month after the first two discs' July performances. These shows provide great insight into the progression of Miles Davis, taking place during the latter part of a transitional phase between his more acoustic-based performances of previous years and the insanely tripped-out, all-out freak-fest that is 'Bitches Brew.'<br /><br />The sound quality on the three discs is pristine, even better than the Fillmore's East and West releases from 1970 featuring many of these same musicians, and I'm just thankful I caved and bought it even though I already own bootlegs of these shows. Every instrument sounds extremely crisp, allowing the listener to hear just how precise and on point these guys were, with intertwining melodies that never falter, even during the sudden and various tempo shifts throughout.<br /><br />\\"Bitches Brew\\" here (performed just a couple months after it was recorded for the album) is definitely intriguing, though seemingly still a work in progress compared with later live performances, while songs like \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\" and Thelonious Monk's 'Round Midnight' are straight-up mind-blowers that are nearly impossible to absorb on the first, or even second or third, listen. There are no duds here, nor even any real hiccups along the way, at least that I can tell, which is amazing for a band so heavily improvisational.<br /><br />The DVD, from a November show in Berlin, is also of excellent quality, featuring color, multi-camera angle shots and great sound. It's awesome to have a 40-plus-year-old performance to watch in such stellar quality--the next best thing toactually having been there, putting the cherry on top of this remarkable document of one of the lesser known Miles Davis groups. Here's hoping there's more where that came from. But I think 'Live in Europe 1969' will keep me more than occupied for a very long time to come.

B00AAL6288|5.0|Good songbook that gradually increase in difficulty and accompanies the lessons and the youtube videos very well.<br /><br />Only downside is that the only option I get is to be able to open on the amazon cloud and not on the kindle on my computer.
B009410J9I|5.0|This video captures a young, talented and hungry trio playing rockabilly as if their lives depend on it.  The music is pure rockabilly, but performed with a punk sensibility.  A mixture of covers tunes and original compositions, including a rare lead vocal by the stand up bassist Lee Rocker on &#34;Drink Your Bottle Down&#34;.  Barely into his twenties Setzer is already a very accomplished player.  Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom play and perform hard, never letting the bottom fall out.  A great snapshot of rock and roll being snatched back from the disco days.  This is how rock and roll should be played.  I encourage any fan of The Stray Cats, rockabilly, punk, or incredible guitar playing to buy this DVD.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Have recently acquired an android phone.  This application is easy to use, provides access to all Amazon has to offer, is easy to navigate, and makes it dangerously easy, and handy, to indulge in adding more books to an already book-filled household.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I finally have all three movie's so i am happy.<br />But as i opened the box i found a note that said a special edition box set will be released later on this year :(<br />oh well, you win sum then you dim sum :) still a good buy but looking foward to the special ed.
0688014291|5.0|I read this book many years ago bought it for my daughter recently and read it again before I gave it to her I think it liked it better the second time. Some really great concepts on management will work most of the time. I've used it many times in the last 25 years it is my Bible for managing companies.  I wish they had it on Kindle publisher needs to keep up with the times.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|i loved it, I've been to India several times so it was good to see the streets and people also the actors and story was great
B002AWX6UM|5.0|It will make you appreciate what you have and understands how other people live with very little resources. Very easy to read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After hearing all the commotion from all of my female colleagues, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and see what the hoopla was about. Although the premise was unique unlike anything I've read before, I ultimately was not impressed about the book. There were certain parts of the story that became redundant and annoying. I've yet to read the following two books, mainly out of fear of disappointment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these three books. They where at times difficult to put down and I got really involved with the characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|3 words: I LOVE IT!!!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 u should really get it! ;) I have only had it like 3 days but its the best tr yet!!!!!<br /> -beautiful me-
B008CRC506|4.0|Just great viewing! Clever, believable characters, good story line.<br />I finish one episode and jump right into the next one!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Got this for my niece and she loved it.  The additional games cost and I might purchase them if she really plays it and wants the other versions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I dont play a lot of runner games, but I do own a few. This is the best so far. The first temple run was also fun, but this is better.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|It has to be one of the funniest, scary stories that isn't a spoof.  We laughed so much and several of the acters in the movie are people that I like so that was a bonus.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Dredd was dreadfull. I like a good action/sci-fi movie but this one had a lot of action but no substance.  It was actually boring.  Don't waste your money.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Anything by Nicholas Sparks is amazing! This one was so touching in the way it turned out. I love how much he was able to incorporate the title into the story.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Awesome plot and everything it was one of the best stories ever and I would recommend it to anyone that is thinking about getting it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I would TOTALLY book to someone else to read. This book is TOTALLY awesome! The person who wrote this book is my hero!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the love story behind the action. The plot kept me guessing. I recommend this to the hopeless romantics and action seekers
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book fasinates me due to his beautiful words ans descriptive imagery. I hope his experience is true because than dying is alot easier to handle.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|I like all the characters and the story line was amusing<br />Great movies to watch with my daughters. Light hearted and funny

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I love how original this book was it, it kept me reading the whole time and it was over before I knew it. I can't wait for the sequel!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I am learning a great deal about myself through this book. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five, it is a long read and the author shares lots of research. I know some people will not appreciate all the research. However, most introverts love research. Stick with the book. You could very well learn a lot about yourself or the loved ones in your life who are introverts.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really liked this book!!  I will read it over and over and over and over and over and over again!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After being on the NY Times best seller list for over a year, I expected this book to be fantastic.  I was disappointed.  It was good but I have read much better books that never made the list.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's alright but it does seem  kind of like a rip off of Temple Run. But it's is a fun game I enjoy the market for boards and characters.
067144901X|5.0|At least for my 15 month old. I don't know what it is about this book, it's very simple, but my daughter is in love with this book. So is my niece. IN LOVE I tell you! Maybe it's the way we read it... very animated, hand gestures, animal noises and tickles. Have fun with it... your child will be making animal noises with the right animal in no time. So cute!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's the little things that our society takes for granted and don't appreciate. I'm thankful everyday for our troops that do their job without any questions asked and this book opens your eyes more about what really does happen! A fantastic read!!!!!!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My kid love watching this movie.  He watches it about 2-3 times a week.  it keeps him occupy and keeps me free for a few hours of doing other things.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game and passes the time I have a lot of free time so this game is good for me goodday
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is a great read that helps you understand the importance of Yemen and the place they hold in the Middle East.  Exciting story that is hard to put down.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really love this book! And I'm absolutely madly in love with the main character, Mark Watney. Not only a nice guy, but a wonderful sense of humor and can fix just about anything... I could really use him around here.<br />There was only one short part probably 3/4 of the way through the book where I thought it was getting a little slow, but that didn't last long. I wont go into any details of the book. Read it and be delighted. :)
B00A89ITZG|5.0|For years I didn't quite know how to run (embarrassingly, especially when it's supposedly so simple).  But after reading the book and trying the principles my form and performance are so much better.<br /><br />Great nook, definitely worth the money.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's even funnier than I remember and full of Americana. Aunt Polly was even more helpless this second time around!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romantic story. It was a story that was hard to put down once you started reading it. Fast paced.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I returned from seeing the movie and went immediately to order this CD from Amazon.  I have been driving around listening to it and reliving the scenes from the movie.  Loved it!
B007NVJ7NU|5.0|I enjoyed this film and found it to be a unique and interesting narrative. At times it is quite intense (i.e. flashing lights), but once you get over this it is quite enjoyable. The main character is well developed, but at times the film was a bit hand holding-y, but this does not detract from the film as a whole.<br /><br />One warning though, if you are susceptible to seizures I do not recommend you watch this film.
034580404X|5.0|I do not know much about this series or even heard of it.  My niece called and inquired and told me what it was and decided with the reviews that it is a definite read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|By far this was my favorite book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  At times I couldn't decide if I loved or hated Katniss...a must read!
B000007XUQ|5.0|It is a Christmas classic.  We have it in our stereo playing at Christmastime every year.  One of the better CDs for Christma
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Every time I see this movie I have to sit down and watch it. So my husband bought me the blu-ray version for Christmas. Wow! What a difference than regular TV. I watched it right away and was blown away. Blu-ray rocks!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, addictive! I really enjoy playing this game. My kids enjoy it too. Even my 3 year old can play it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The charger and cable that came with the Fire had a very loose fit and this affected the quality of my Kindle's charging.  Along with the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger, my Kindle takes a charge quickly and seems to hold the charge for a longer period.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. Minecraft is only rivaled by The Elder Scrolls game series. Notch, thank you for inventing this game!
1451629192|4.0|In June of 1991, Jaycee Dugard was like any other 11-year-old.  She went to school, she had friends, and rode her bike.  She lived in California and had a one year old baby sister.<br /><br />Then just like that, she was stolen.<br /><br />A van pulled up, a pretense of asking for directions and she was gone.<br /><br />For the next eighteen years of her life, Jaycee was held captive by Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy.  She was kept in a locked and hidden shed in their back yard.  During her first six years of captivity Jaycee gave birth to two of Phillips children.  By the age of seventeen she was a mother twice over all the while painfully missing her own mom and wondering if she would ever find her way home again.<br /><br />In August of 2009, Jaycee and her daughters were discovered and rescued.<br /><br />In her own words, this is her story.<br /><br />When I first seen this book on the store shelf I was vaguely familiar with the story.  I brought it home and started reading it and be sure when I tell you this, the first 50 pages of this book are hard to read mainly because of the detailed telling of what happened to Jaycee at the age of 11.  I think it would have been easier to handle if the book would have been written by a third-party, but the fact that Jaycee wrote this book and relived the details of her early days of captivity gave it an even more impact of emotion on me.<br /><br />This is not to say it is not a worthwhile read.  What Jaycee endured all of those years is shocking, painful, insane, and yet you see this young girl hang on to hope and a dream of someday being free.<br /><br />At first I was not sure I would like the writing, the beginning of the book felt a little cold and matter of fact when Jaycee described in great detail what happened those first few days and weeks.  I felt as though perhaps she had distanced herself from this painful period by writing as though she was writing about what happened to someone else.  Then, almost as quickly as I had that feeling, it went away and Jaycee's story of eighteen years of dealing with two very disturbing people pulls you in page after page.  I found myself wanting to get back to the read whenever I could because I wanted to know what happened and how she would finally be discovered and rescued.<br /><br />  \\"The more knowledge I gain, the more like an adult I feel. I never got this chance to become an adult.\\"<br /><br />  ~Jaycee Dugardickly as I had that feeling, it went away and Jaycee's story of eighteen years of dealing with two very disturbing people pulls you in page after page.

B004G600A4|5.0|An instant Disney classic.  If you loved Beauty and the Beast you will enjoy this one!  Beautiful imagery.  Fun story.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I picked this movie up the other day from a local Best Buy.  My daughter almost five was hesitant to watch it, she was a little worried about the zombies in it.  But after a couple of minutes she loved it, and when I asked her if she liked it she was said it was ok, when I then said well then I'll take it back, she said no daddy I love it, it is so funny.  It is appropriate for kids but also contains elements that an adult can enjoy. The voice cast was really good as well, with many that are easily recognized. The animation was well done.  I would definitely recommend this for families with younger kids.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is just that classic voice of Van Morrison. Sooo wonderful! The composition, the music, all great. Good to hear him again.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|the wikipedia app is a must have for the kindle fire. it is convenient and quite easy to use .
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Having firsthand experience with mental illness, I can testify as to the accuracy of this book in telling the story of this troubled man.  I saw the movie before reading the book, but wish I had done the reverse. I know this book will be one that I will read more than once. Be prepared to experience what it is to feel out of control and struggling to maintain relationships which are challenging.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|As of today 1-30-13 I cannot say anything, as I had it shipped to a cousin in New Jersey. Haven't heard from her as to whether or not it arrived and in what condition. I will not ask her, as it is to be a surprise gift from me.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|written by my 4th grade son: As I read this  book I am awed at the detail in the characters and colors of the land of oz. I have seen the musical of wicked and after reading this book will want to read L.Frank's great version of it .  The aftermath of the wicked witch of the west is almost as if it were there right in front of you.  The wonderful wizard of oz is a great read if you were ever wondering anything about it.  My friend asha recommended this book to me and finding out it was free I imeaditly bought the book.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I have three watches from Invicta and I have been completely satisfied with them all. I've received many compliments from each one. Once I opened the box, my eyes opened as if I got the present I've always wanted for Christmas! Even when I took it out, my father was staring at it because he really liked it.<br /><br />The face is rather big but that is what makes this watch so unique. I personally love chronograph; it gives the watch a more professional look. I honestly thought the watch would be thicker and heavier than my other watches but to my surprise it was a comfortable wear.<br /><br />I am right-handed so when buying this, I was aware that this was a left-handed watch - I like it. The dials do not dig into my hand/wrist. This was my first leather band watch and wow...does it make a difference on weight and comfort. There is a 'link' (correct me if I'm wrong) that the band goes through after the buckle and it is in uncomfortable position but I got used to it.<br /><br />This watch can be worn with casual and business clothing. It is very subtle and doesn't have that &#34;too much&#34; feeling.<br /><br />As a college student, this definitely fits my budget and it looks great! You don't have to be a millionaire to look like a millionaire as I always say. I will absolutely keep buying Invicta until I can upgrade from bologna (Tag Heuer/Movado/etc.)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Did Jacob commit the murder of his classmate?  I was totally riveted, changing my mind continually as the events unfolded. Then, just when I thought I had my answer...
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase . I take my kindle everywhere i can carry it , or put it in my bag and wont be afraid of scrathing it . nice case .
B003E2UQMS|4.0|quirky book with sweet outcome, easy to indulge in. no real character development - perhaps a symptom of mental illness?!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome Game I really like it allot it a nice game law las las kiss less kiss less law law law law law law
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Finished this book over my winter break and immediately got the next one. This series keeps you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think you have it figured out, something else happens
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am not in favor or posting my life history for the world to read about, but do enjoy reading what others have to say.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the books, and half way through this one and couldn't be happier. Very quick read, and keeps your interest
1849904251|5.0|I got this as a (very belated) Christmas present for my best friend, because we both LOVE the show. Before I it to her I read it myself and it's brilliant! She screamed when she got it and read the whole thing cover to cover that very day. Clever writing, interesting information about the show, and cool insights into John and Sherlock's life as flatmates.... If you like the tv show Sherlock, buy this book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exciting, interesting and captivating. Keeps your interest throughout the entire book, the ending makes you immediately want the next book. Highly recommend
B0094BB4TW|2.0|is there anyway to see ne status updates without scrolling the whole way back to the top. my aneroid phone will have a popup that States 8 new statuses .
B00846REIS|5.0|Best book I've ever read. 10x better than 50 shades of grey. This book never gets boring and the chemistry is non stop.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|This 1974 version of The Great Gatsby is one of those movies to watch over and over again. Leonardo DiCaprio has big shoes to fill!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fine &#34;chick&#34; book and lives up to its reputation.  It's not something I yearn to pick up and read every day.
B00000IREA|5.0|This is kind of a goofy sci-fi movie but it has always been one of my favorites and I still like it!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I watched with my 13 year old daughter and she loved it.  My 9 year old son came in about 20 minutes in and watched the rest of the movie with us as well!  That was a surprise!  The story is fairly predictable, but the characters are engaging and are quite talented.  It was enjoyable.  My daughter has asked for the DVD or download for her birthday, so she will watch it repeatedly!
B005LAII8A|4.0|It is a rare film where a mother's love for her child is the basis and salvation of an action thriller.  Blunt, Dano and Gordon-Levitt are standout but Pierce Gagnon stole the show as Cid.  This film stayed with me, and that is the gauge that movie magic happened because I felt something real.  Recommended!
0525953728|5.0|This was an excellent book and very well written. The author/Ex Navy Seal writes with detail and humility, and one could feel the pride he took with each mission.  From the moment I started to read this book I could not put it down.  I thought the account was most accurate and gave the bottom-line facts of the mission. The best book of 2012 hands down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so fun and addicting I love it I play it every day you should get this it rocks so much and if you get it rate it and you will get 3 gems for free
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it best season yet! So much emotion. crazy twists. Never know what to expect. Look forward every week to &#34;my time&#34; Downton Abbey time!

0307592731|3.0|I don't read much but this one had me hooked enough to finish it. I was more interested in her hike then I was about her life but then again, if you hike enough, the true life will come out of you eventually. Especially if you hike your own hike.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This  book was  very wonderful.  Just perfect for a fourth grader any grade even, in fact anyone!!!! Best book ever! Also for kid s  grown ups or any one look up the song wonders... very good song. Every one had to read this book my daughter read it and she stated crying and laughing in almost every part!!! Loved it!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Much funnier than expected. Highly enjoyable and I'm not a fan of silly movies. Definitely rent!<br />Rebel Wilson is funny and Kendrick has amazing voice.<br />Brittany Snow has phenomenal voice as well.<br />It's like a Bring it On version of Glee with better actors.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This a very good app to keep track of the weather.<br />There's a lot of good features to give me everything to keep on top of the weather, and plan outdoor action.<br />I like to garden and this app will ( I hope ) help me with planting at the right times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its Pinterest! What else is there to say. App functions as the pc version does and doesnt have any glitches so far.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game to play, started off playing to kill boredom but it gets addicting, my kids enjoy playing it too
B004SIIBGU|5.0|App works great on my Kindle. Functions same as pc version with no glitches! Definitely worth downloading if your an Ebay junkie!
0156012197|3.0|Firstly, the package arrived in perfect order. Amazon products are in excellent order when delivered half way round the world.<br />I will need to read this book again when I finish it. It is a book that requires a lot of focus to absorb its meaning. One needs a clear mind and focus. I am sure it will end well!<br />I recommend this book to all who can be quiet in mind and not be distracted by outside influences.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really don’t get what all the fuss is about.  I thought this book was poorly written, repetitive, and the characters were highly unlikeable.  I didn’t even make it halfway through.
0307887960|5.0|This book arrived in excellent condition as was the packaging. Thank you.<br />The book is very informative, thorough and well explained. Each step is given its full meaning and there is no way a person will not understand the Dukan Diet if they read this book.<br />I recommend this book to all who wish to understand and use a successful diet.<br />It works as well.<br />You will not be disappointed....
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in a movie that should be required watching, especially to anyone who dismisses the other works of Stephen King as 'too scary' or 'weird'.<br /><br />Though it comes from a very specific time in US history, the story feels timeless due to the insular world of Shawshank.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Got this in time to surprise my daughter with it, and she was very excited to receive it. She had been asking for it for months!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Piano Master is a cute game.  If you have some free time go goof around it is fun.  It does not really teach you how to play a piano but its fun.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use it every day exept Saturday. it is a great app. you should buy it. only, you should probably plug your device in when running this app.
B004FECNIO|1.0|I've seen a lot of films, and based on the trailers was really looking forward to this one. Wow, this movie SUCKED.  I've never seen a movie that was so smarmy.  I was preying for this to end (don't ask me why my wife and I didn't just get up and leave.)  Just when I felt \\"YEAH, IT's OVER!\\", there was plot twist and it ground on for another half-hour.  Save your money, and your sanity,  Pass on this one.
1616550414|5.0|If you know that she/he likes any Zelda game... they will love you if you give them this book, guaranteed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nice variety of games in one app. Never boring. Fun to strive to open new games. Some games are simple while others are quite a challenge. Very entertaining.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|The story was pretty good but it's almost like watching a documentary instead of a movie.<br />I wasn't impressed with some of the acting; it could have been a little better. The battles scenes were very well done. It showed what it was like over there at that time.<br />Compared to Band of Brothers (which is one of my favorite shows to watch!) this was pretty smutty. I'm sure the way it was portrayed in the series is what really happened over there for a lot of the men but they didn't have to dwell on those as much. Also, compared to Band of Brothers you didn't get to know the characters in the story that much. It was a little too impersonal.<br />Overall, if you like watching war movies then I'd say the battle scenes are the best part of this series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for anyone who loves horses! my sister plays it all the time and she got me in to it. the graphics are amazing
B005K17RU0|4.0|Only had it for a week- seems accurate. fast loading and easy to add new locations. will use it when travelling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is my life it is very cool and when I need help on gameplay I go to the minecraft wiki it's definitely earning my 5 stars
B007PPE086|5.0|Great details, from her streaked hair (ala The Bride of Frank'), down to her bolt-themed heels (an homage to her pa). My 11 yr old niece squealed with joy!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Along with being an amazing story and the music of this man is really quite beautiful and thought-provoking, the best part about this movie is the reminder that that it is possible to be a kind, gentle, and humble person no matter what life throws at you. After watching this movie I thought to myself, &#34;If I can only be half the man this guy is...I will have a wonderful fulfilled life.
B00B7G3BUW|4.0|While the dark nature of Frank Miller's original comic is nothing new, the surprise here is how far Warner Bros. was willing to go to capture that feeling in an animated film. This one pushes the envelope of any animated Batman movie. The movie is brutally violent throughout, and the confrontation between Batman and the Joker leaves nothing (or no one) spared. Despite the shock and awe factor, this is still a strong conclusion to the Batman's legacy and a powerful adaptation of Frank Miller's classic work. This is a must see for Batman followers.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a awesome product very fun and addicting I hope you come out with subway surf 2 hood job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Cx

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game if you want a horse and can't have one. And you don't have to clean up after it. If you do its a game.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have enjoyed the CD it was a great buy. I have to tell all my friends. The CD was in perfect shape.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Let me get this out of the way. I know this movie has pretty bad writing. I know the plot is silly. I know there are major holes in it. I know the script was messy. I know this movie has major problems. But for me, that's not what is important.<br />I go to entertainment to be... entertained. I play games and watch movies for raw emotion. How much a movie can get me caught up in a moment, how much it can make me care, how invested I am, and how much it can simply make me feel, these things are what's important to me. And that's what this movie has in spades. Sure, it's got sub par writing, but let me tell you this; I enjoy this movie far more than many other movies which are considered masterpieces. The Dark Knight Rises evokes so much in me. It draws raw emotion. And that's what I look for in my entertainment.<br /><br />Oh, and the mask looks freaking awesome too.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was a fun H.O. game. It was a good story, the only thing was is that it wasn't as hard as others made it seem. I beat it within a few hours from starting. One thing I didn't do was find all the extra &quot; stuff &quot; because I was only paying attention to the task at hand.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|I'm in the odd group of people who were not that into The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan did Bruce Wayne very well. His Batman however, felt a little generic. It wasn't bad, just far less interesting than his take on Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me. It depends really. What do you like more? Bruce Wayne or Batman?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this trilogy but once I started it I could not stop reading it! Thanks for the first book now on to the second!
0316227706|5.0|This book is spectacular. I've given it as a gift on a number of occasions to fellow dog lovers and everyone loves it. Fascinating and entertaining!
1451695195|1.0|I read this book at the behest of a friend who knows I'm a deeply committed Christian.  Because the book is a testimonial and makes truth claims, the credibility of the author is critical in evaluating what he says.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed in reading it is signs of Narcissistic Personality Disorder on page after page; Alexander asserts his exceptionalism from beginning to end, sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously.  I decided to check out his background on healthgrade.com, a website which helps prospective patients find a qualified doctor.  The opening page on Dr. Eben Alexander III warns \\"It's important to do your research before making an appointment with this provider.\\"<br /><br />His background includes two malpractice suits in 2007 after performing surgery on the wrong sites, and in both cases he attempted to conceal what happened -- in one case retroactively altering the original diagnosis to make it appear he hadn't erred.  He faced medical board sanctions and reprimands in 2009 and 2010 in three states (MA, VA and NC), and was ordered to attend classes in professionalism and medical ethics.  He never mentions any of this in the book -- published in 2012, so it wasn't ancient history while he was writing it.<br /><br />Further evidence of his lack of credibility is his assertion that his experience is scientific `proof` of an afterlife.  Not even a bad scientist would make this claim:  Scientific proof requires that a hypothesis can be tested, and the results can be replicated by other scientists -- that's Science 101.  What his experience, if we can believe it, proves is that the brain is a mystery we are only beginning to understand.<br /><br />If Alexander had said, \\"This is true for me, I can't prove it, but I believe it completely,\\" I would be inclined to put more faith in what he says in spite of my reservations.
B000NY17J6|5.0|I was a amazing collection of songs that I heard when I was growing up.  She is one of my favorite artists.
1400067820|5.0|Nassim Taleb has never failed to challenge our thinking, and this book is no different!  I have to admit I am only about three quarters of the way through the book, due to the need to go back and reread so many chapters before I can proceed.  Still, I feel that I have a much better outlook and attitude toward the upheavals in our world, and know that we are on our way to a better place...if only those who care to do the hard work of adjusting to new systems and challenges.  Well worth the price of the book and the time invested in reading.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I got hooked on this book when they reran every episode last summer!  Needless to say, I don't like some of my favorites getting killed off, but you just can't stop watching!  Great show!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I really don't want to stretch this out much, but it was a good book. Word word word word word(that got rid of the extra 5 words.)
B0007LXPBI|4.0|My grandchildren, ages 7 (boy) and 9 (girl) love this movie.  They have watched it over and over and it still holds their interest.  I know that will pass - but it was fun to watch it with them.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Such a sweet kind child movie. I wish they were all this thoughtful! It was a great gift to give for Christmas!

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved the 1st half of this book.  Very well written and you really love the characters.  There are some great twists but I thought the reaction by the characters to &#34;the twists&#34; was just to unrealistic. Went from a great love story to ...&#34;whatever&#34;...and I didn't want that to happen...Don't know if I would recommend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's very addicting but love it!  It's going to be one of those games you have to keep playing , trying to beat your last score.
B008N1V11U|3.0|The graphics are beautiful for a table game, but the high-resolution causes the game to run slow.  It's often hard to control the character if the framerate is dipping in and out.
1426308469|5.0|My toddler has numerous dinosaur books and this is by far the best one in terms of information, ease-of-use, pictures, and fun! It has a great feature in that it phonetically shows you how to properly pronounce all of the names of the dinosaurs. This comes in quite handy when you are reading it to your kids!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|A decent app for buying and selling on ebay.  I still prefer to use a normal computer when I'm listing items for sale, but the app is a good way to make purchases and monitor the items you're selling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  So far I've gotten to 3 different boards and haven't gotten bored yet.  This game id fresh and vibrant and keeps u guessing.  I personally give it 10 stars.
B008KE3960|4.0|The game gets a bit repetitive because it takes awhile to earn enough &#34;coins&#34; to purchase additional levels and planes, but it's quite fun.  Similar to &#34;Bloons Tower Defense&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great story!!!!! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great book full of action. 5 stars!
0380789035|5.0|Stardust is my favorite book of all time, so naturally, when I was recommended another Neil Gaiman book I was very interested. The beginning of the book is very sad, but it picks up from there, and fast. I don't want to give too much away, but you will never think of &#34;Gods&#34; the same way again! My favorite part of this book, so much so that I actually had to stop and tell people about it before continuing to read it, was when they arrived at &#34;The House On The Rock&#34;. I have desperately wanted to visit that museum since first hearing about it, so to read about it in a great book, by an amazing author was just the icing on the cake for me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked the use of scientific knowledge to stay alive. The adventure is relieved with his reviews of the other astronauts entertainment material left to him.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this and the other book, &#34;5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth&#34;, for my husband after he expressed interest in them from The Oatmeal's website. Book is very funny!

0385344228|4.0|Landay is a talented writer, develops his main character well. The reader can get into the character's mind and see what he is thinking.  The father, a former assistant DA refuses to see the red flags about his son's behavior when a murder is committed in this small town in Massachusetts.  The father even helps discard possible evidence, blind to the fact that his son might possibly be guilty of a crime.  I was amazed that an experienced DA could be so blindsighted when it comes to his own son as to totally disregard critical evidence.  Maybe all parents would do the same to protect their child. His wife is more aware, but seems unable to cope with the concept. This is a page turner, you won't be able to put the book down. All during the book, I was wondering how the local population would regard this respected citizen who is now defending his son so vehemently. Intriguing concept.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its AMAZING and addictive!!!!!!if you loved temple run 1 definitely get this one and it has great new features that i love and hopefully you will too!!!!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the show. It makes you think back on all you're Nursery Rhymes and nursery story. makes me wonder if they're going to bring back Thumbelina, princess Swan, old lady in the shoe, Beauty and the Beast. just a few that I can think about.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|I read the book first and actually cried at the end it was so touching. A few days later I watched the movie and was completely disappointed. I would recommend reading the book and never watching the movie!
B005LAII8K|4.0|I love the movie, but I gave it 4 stars for not having the dvd combo.  I would at least like the option.
0143038095|2.0|I read this book for my Pre-AP analytical essay. As much as I wanted to love it, the book made it very hard.<br /><br />The Good:<br />*The story line of reconnecting mothers with daughters was  a great idea! I heard about this and I wanted to read<br /> it right away.<br />*The symbolism when you look deeper into it was very inspiring. I would have never thought of using half of the symbols to mean anything!<br />*3rd person omniscient helped understand where the characters were coming from.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />*There was not that much direct communication between mothers and daughters. It would have been nice to see exactly how the mothers used their stories to rekindle relationships with their daughters but the only one that really did that was Ying-Ying<br />*Characters have bad qualities. Most of the daughters seemed whiny and annoying. None of the daughters really wanted to stand up for themselves, and if they did it was for something stupid like a Chess game. I'm sorry, but if the worst thing that is going on in your life is \\"not wanting to play chess\\" then the solution is simple, don't. The mothers were less whiny, but seemed a lot more abandoning. Not once in the story did the daughters ever say that they went to their mothers for advise/help. Most didn't like their mothers at all. Whereas the mothers', when they were growing up, seemed as thought they had motherly figures that genuinely cared for them. Which you would think they would show to their daughters but not.<br />*A lot of the issues were left unresolved. You never know if the daughters get out of troubling relationships, or if the mothers ever get the relationship they want with their daughters back (with the exception of the Jongs). It's quite aggravating when everyone stresses about how the story is about rebuilding relationships when you never know if it actually happened.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If I didn't have to read this for a class, I would have put it back on the shelf after the first two sections. It was boring long and drawn out with no relation to the ending.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|very fun game It is interesting to people who love horses like me I think you should get this app the graphics aren't blurry
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book has a bit of a difference in the mood compared to the other books. I loved it! It was a wonderful read

B0058VW36U|5.0|The family loves this game. It has us all thinking of the best method to cut the rope to earn the most points. Good times!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After Hunger Games being such a success and catching fire  being a close second, I expected this to be wonderful but it dragged on with to much political talk.  Don't get me wrong it was still great but could have been a little better.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I couldn't stop grinning for the first 30 minutes....I was in awe the rest of the time.  40 years later and still the greatest.<br /><br />This concert lives up to the hype. You'll understand why Led Zeppelin is the greatest band EVER.<br />This is how it's done....<br /><br />John Paul Jones holds it all together as the most talented utility man in the business. He can play anything.<br />Jimmy Page Is in fine form, nails all his parts, his trademark sound and swagger, it's all there, and he plays with the emotion and skill he's known for.<br />Robert Plant sounds better here than he has in literally years and somehow manages to consistently hit high notes he hasn't hit in 20 years.<br />Last but not least.... Jason Bonham. Wow. He holds it down in a way that would make his old man proud. No one else could sit behind this band and pound those skins in a such a way that you could legitimately call this LED ZEPPELIN. He's been in the business a long time and has played with some of the best musicians in the world. This is nothing contrived. If anyone deserves to be there, it's him.<br /><br />The set list rocks and each number is tight. They seem to get stronger as the set goes on which is incredible to witness.<br />I'd give an appendage to have been at this show. Not having the opportunity to be there just reaffirms the fact that life isn't fair. I'll have to be content to see it here instead.....but at that rate, I'm not going to complain.<br /><br />The sound quality of the BluRay is fantastic. The video quality is fantastic. The light show is perfect.<br />Do yourself a huge favor and play this on a credible home theater system.....loud. Real loud.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome series. I hated to end the book. I am not a scifi book lover but this book really appealed to me. It's an easy must read book!
B0045NDVFE|4.0|The songs all have some substance and I've enjoyed listening to this repeatedly since I purchased it.  I even found some songs that I originally wasn't interested in that I really like.
630469654X|5.0|I had looked everywhere for this title, even here,  but couldn't find it until now. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was in Blu-Ray.
0439023491|4.0|The book was in good condition when I received it which I was happy about. The plastic cover had a small tear in the back but otherwise the condition is great and I would buy more books on Amazon.
1568490119|5.0|Hardback for this book are difficult to find. I needed it to be hardback for a friend that only buys hardbacks.
B009C7JS14|1.0|I ordered this in error. Tried a few weather apps and settled on  the WEATHER CHANNEL.  I was glad this was free.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This will tell you your top five innate personal strengths and how they make you different from all the other applicants and helps you tell a prospetive employer just how you will fit in. It is an invaluable tool.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Loved the story & have a somewhat connection. This is based on a true story of a student who graduated from Briarcrest  Christian school where one of my grandsons is currently a student. The Miss Sue who was Michael's academic coach in the movie was based on the true story Of Miss Sue ,my  daughter&#34;s cheerleader sponsor, a wonderful person. Will be watching this yrs  Super Bowl for sure!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I have been looking for The Jungle Book for several months. I could find all kinds of Jungle Book II, but that is not what I wanted. And, it was for a much better price than I was expecting.
B000002MJC|5.0|I bought this CD because I am a huge Depeche Mode fan and am currently collecting their discography. This CD features some very great songs like &#34;I Feel You&#34; and &#34;In Your Room&#34;. Weather you are already a Depeche Mode fan or are just starting to listen to the band this CD is a great addition to your CD collection.
B003L77G10|5.0|Didn't get started on this series on TV, but now am hooked and can't stop watching it, hours at a time! Highly recommend!!
B000002L75|5.0|I bought this CD because I am a huge Depeche Mode fan and am collecting their discography. This album in particular is a very good one. It features my favorite song by them (Lie To Me) along with many other great singles. Weather you are an old time fan or just now discovering the band this is definitely a good CD to buy.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I wish there was a little more action, but the dialogue and plot made up for that. Definitely a 5 star.
B000002KN8|3.0|I bought this item simply because it was Depeche Mode (one of my favorite bands) and I didn't recognize any of the track listings. I later found out that was for a reason. I didn't much care for this album in particular. If you are a die hard Depeche Mode fan like I am, go ahead and buy it. If you are just now checking out the band, try a different CD instead.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I just can not stop playing this game. you can not win very often but when you do what a grand feeling.
B000002LCI|5.0|I bought this CD because I am a huge Depeche Mode fan and am collecting their discography. This is one of my favorite albums by them. &#34;Never Let Me Down Again&#34; and &#34;Strange Love&#34; are in my opinion two of their best songs. This CD features other successful singles and would make a great addition to your CD collection.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I am blown away! Amazing musicians! Amazing Music! Amazing production! Amazing Sound quality! Incredible! I show people this video and tell them that I will stop this video whenever they want me too. And they have a hard time telling me to stop it.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I loved the book and the way it sets you up to be grateful for ten things a day and by day 28 you feel that you have seen things in a more grateful perspective. Thank you for this book. I will continue on my gratitude journey. I highly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well written with a few suprises that will please the reader. You may think you know how it ends but you probably don't. But you won't be dissapopinted.
0316223239|3.0|been wanting to read this one and was a bit disappointed... I should of read the reviews more carefully....it was told/narrated by the interpretation of a 5 year old child, which is an interesting concept but had to keep re-reading which doesn't sit well with me.  Hard to get thru the beginning, by the middle a bit more intense and kind of died down at the end.  There was no real wow factor for me, I think it would of been worth it if it was narrated by an adult.....don't pay full price, not worth it!!!!
B008ZTW7OU|5.0|The Sheepdogs transport you back to the days when rock n' roll was still inventive and expressive.  You can't help but hear a little bit of Allman Brothers or other 70's southern rock in their sound, but they seem to mix it up with a cool laid back sound that at times almost reminds me of the Band.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The charactors are so colorful.  Highly addictive.  Anyone who enjoys history or just the beauty of the early 1900's will love this series.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The first 2 books were amazing and in continuing with that theme so was the 3rd! It kept you on your toes and I didn't want to put this one down either- I'm ready for another!!
B004R2DS9C|4.0|THis is such a cute way to wrap a present for a 9 year old!  My grandson loves Star wars and he needs storage for stuff so thought this would be two for one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I kept reading until I finished it.  Read it in one day.  A little different from the movie, which is also excellent.
B00000J0O2|1.0|The company that rebuilt that cartridge did an awful job.  The print quality is poor, and forget trying to print any pictures because the ink is too weak to be seen in anything lighter then black, yup shades of gray are either entirely missing or so weak they can't really be seen well.  I ended up buying a new (not remanufactured) cartridge instead and now the printing of shades of gray is great.  Also the cartridge page printing capabilities was far less then a new one.  I thought I could find a decent rebuilt cartridge to save money, but instead got horrible results and ended up buying a new one anyways.  Save your money, at least don't buy it from this cartridge rebuilder, find another with known high reviews.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game. It is addicting!  I love that it changes subways too.  I highly recommend this game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun and addictive. &amp; unique. Many many games. So you can play for hours &amp;  not get bored !
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Note the word &#34;backpack.&#34; This is *not* a &#34;bag.&#34; If you don't have lots of equipment, this will be far too bulky for your needs. As it is, we just bought the Canon Rebel 3Ti with the kit lens, and if feels almost silly to carry this around - there is so much empty space! If you are packing a ton of gear, this is probably a good choice - it's sturdy and has lots of compartments. Otherwise, it's not just something you grab for some quick pictures of the kids at the park.
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|Love this soundtrack It always gives me that warrior feeling inside the discipline and honor. Also its made from Hans Zimmer so that right there is the main reason you should buy it hes a Legend when it comes to soundtracks you feel the heart and soul of his music every piece has a breath a life of its own.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie wasn't what it was made out to be, hard to follow. Tried to watch it twice with my son and I fell asleep both times and he didn't care for it .
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pretty good overall, but I haven't figured out how to add a new pin using a URL. Easy to navigate other than that though.
B008602KQI|5.0|Real life feelings being displayed and it shows us what could possibly happen if the government got to much power.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an interesting and awesome book. At first I didn't want  to read the series but I was hooked by the first book but mockingjay was the best.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was great. The wicked Queen was great and was easily hated, and it was easy to root for Snow and the huntsman.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I chose the rating because it kept me interested.Each time I stopped reading it was compelling to read again and it ended beautifully
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie kept us entertained from the beginning to the end. The plot was there and very good. We will definetly watch this one again.
B002E8B212|5.0|If you enjoy the blues,than this is a great album/CD to add to one's musical selection.2great artists getting together and combining their own styles to make an enjoyable Album to listen on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This was a good movie, it was different and we watched it a couple of times and that was enough.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Last Man ties in some of our most challenging political problems with breakneck speed and a tight believable plot. Fun fast read.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was a plesant surprise. I thought it would be another comic book movie but it was great to watch, so much so I watched it twice.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|This is a grab you by the throat kind of movie that shakes you until you're ready to scream. Things get off to a predictable start on a cruise ship on New Year's Eve when everything starts to go wrong. There are probably few, if any, who do not know what is going to happen so when it happens there are no big surprises.<br /><br />The only question left is how do our heroes manage to do what we know they're going to do? That's what this movie is all about, tracking the adventures of this small group as they defy all odds and survive a nightmarish disaster.<br /><br />The acting is all acceptable with the major members of the cast turning in credible performances as they meet the challenges presented by this disaster. The special effects are convincing and terrifying enough to make one question the wisdom of cruising on the open seas for pleasure. If one is inclined toward claustrophobia it will be an especially challenging ride as our heroes must make do with several life-threatening, claustrophobic situations.<br /><br />If you enjoy disaster flicks this is one you owe it to yourself to have seen; whether or not you want to watch it twice is up to you.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This MIB was definetly different than any of the others. It was very unpredictable, sorry to see Zed die, but his replacement was really great!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Okay, I love \\"The Con\\" and every previous Tegan and Sara album, and this is different -- a little poppier, a little more orchestral, a lot less acoustic.  And I love every minute of it.  I played it straight through five times yesterday while I was working--I write to music and have been writing lately to a 600-song playlist that's a big mash-up, but when I listened to this for the first time I just backed it up and started it over.  And over.  The songwriting is the key.  They're both (I guess) miraculous songwriters.  And the singing is, as always, passionate and precise, and the vocal arrangements are great.  Just a wonderful album.  I usually list, at the end of my books, the music I listened to, and this will be on top when I finish the new one.
B009329ZF2|5.0|It was full of action, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and wanting to watch again and again.
0375842209|4.0|In a year where I have had several disappointing reads, this book was wonderful. The characters were strong and I felt as if I was really \\"there\\" to see, hear and feel the story. The narration by Death was an interesting twist and I enjoyed the use of German sprinkled throughout the book. The emotions were real, the story pulled you in and I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie was very action packed, and kept us wanting more and delivered it. The action shots were amazing, Abraham Lincoln never looked so good.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a fun game to play. There were not too many search and find mini-games. The other mini-games were very enjoyable. Definitely worth the money.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This movie isn't like the originals, it keeps you entertained thoughout the end. We would gladly watch this movie again.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Kept us on our seats, action pact all the way through. More realistic than the original, and not as comical.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book is intense!! Something mind blowing around every corner. Very well written. With a ending you never would  of expected
B003RV43X4|3.0|It was a good movie and was easy to follow. The ending could have worked out a little better. Nice action.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!<br /><br />It sure helps the time go by while waiting for a doctor's appointment.  I am really enjoying it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I was excited to see Scott return to the sci-fi genre he has done so well in the past, but, through the entire movie I kept thinking &#34; haven't I seen this before?&#34;  Oh yeah &#34;ALIEN&#34;.  Very disappointed to sit through what looked like a complete rehash with new staff and a lot more FX
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this Kindle cover.<br /><br />That it turns my Kindle on and off when I open the cover is wonderful.
B0013FBS20|5.0|this is a dark and disturbing flick that made my 28 year old self afraid of the dark. bluray is always best and the alternate version is a nice added feature.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|CANCER...<br /><br />John Green gives insight into the life of a teenager with cancer...their take in the tumultuous, hopeless, tailspin of terminal illness.<br /><br />I hadn't read a novel on this topic and was fairly impressed.<br /><br />At moments the story tended to lag and carry on very slowly, but the intended message and points were made.<br /><br />Its difficult to find love and prosper in a life where you're living to die, but if there isn't any hope than why even care. But we're given a very good reason to read on...<br /><br />John Green portrayed what I feel was a very realistic take on the views and internal dialogue that one would encounter having lived with cancer and had no hope in healing.<br /><br />I wish the ending had more to it. I was a bit let down - I was devastated of course, but something was going to happen, I just wasn't prepared for it.<br /><br />This was thoroughly well written and flowed cohesively.<br /><br />You will need the kleenex and an open heart to take in the depth and heaviness of this one.
0765325950|3.0|Shouldn't it be Vera's? It was like nails on a chalk board every time. I was pretty disappointed with the book, but didn't hate it. Basically, I agree with everything in D. Parvin's review, and highly recommend reading that review as well as the comments to it.
1616550414|5.0|Most of the art work collected here is from Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, but still a great buy with artwork from 20+ years of Zelda games.  Contains interviews with the creators and a manga at the back.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Great author, I adore Harry Potter and re-read them constantly.  This IS a masterful character study, and many of the characters in this book will stay in my mind forever, BUT not one of them is likable and it's just such a horrid little look at the dirty side of small town politics and people.  BUT because the people are so real to me, it's really is a masterpiece.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|I rated this movie 4 stars because I think Clint Eastwood. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are awesome actors.  The movie was a little on the slow side and the shootout scene in the bar was even slower.  Not the best western movie but a good watch.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|CD arrived in excellent condition and very quickly.  Too bad I had to buy a single to get the song because it wasn't on the main soundtrack CD.  Marketing Trickery?  Excellent single.

B000002L9O|4.0|The general consensus among critics is that throughout the 80s, the Ramones continued to grasp for the record that would make them a huge sensation, but never quite got there, and as a result the quality of their output throughout the decade was varied. Fans, hardcore and casual, often agree that the Ramones should have been the biggest band in the world (though most punk bands, when they reach the Top 10, are immediately accused of \\"selling out\\" - whatever that means - by their fans anyway, so what's the point?).<br />Jean Beauvoir's production on 1986's \\"Animal Boy\\" may have clashed a bit with the first-album three-chord buzzsaw approach, but he did an outstanding job at capturing a band who refused to change in an era of drum machines and synthesizers, even if a few compromises to their sound were made. Beauvoir does a much better job than the notorious pairing with Phil Spector on the controversial \\"End of the Century\\" album. And like \\"Pleasant Dreams\\" after it seemed to be a compromise between Spector's lush production and the Ramones' punk attack, \\"Animal Boy\\" found Jean Beauvoir admirably producing a band who weren't as willing to change their sound as other groups of the era - and we're thankful they didn't.<br />The Ramones' panzer-punk force is still mightily at the fore on tracks like 'Mental Hell,' 'Somebody Put Something In My Drink,' 'Love Kills' (sung by DeeDee Ramone), and 'Apeman Hop' (if you can get past the cheesy intro). The standout title track could be turned into an anthem for a Creationist such as myself and is a relentless, prime example of great 80s Ramones. 'Crummy Stuff,' (though undeniably infectious), 'Hair of the Dog,' 'Eat That Rat' and 'Freak of Nature' are nothing special however, the album's only throwaways, although they do, if nothing else, blow your face off with grit and guitar-driven fury.<br />Other places are suspiciously Top 40-ish but demand repeated listening - 'Something To Believe In' and the ballad 'She Belongs To Me' find the band stunningly versatile, and Joey Ramone's sensitive but powerhouse vocals on the latter put Phil Spector's over-the-top production on 'Baby I Love You' to shame. Perhaps the most famous track from \\"Animal Boy\\" is 'Bonzo Goes To Bitburg,' a Reagan-era satire that embodies both top-notch production and classic, unwavering Ramones - the kind of track the first family of punk would have been producing on a regular basis if they had ever truly become \\"the biggest band in the world.\\"find the band stunningly versatile, and Joey Ramone's sensitive but powerhouse vocals on the latter put Phil Spector's over-the-top production on 'Baby I Love You' to shame.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I found the story mildly interesting and unfortunately i have a problem with any, even mild, grammatical errors that are not part of a quotation from the characters. I am surprised when I see that even publishers are careless these days in these technicalities.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the book began somewhat slow. The author has you believing one thing when later you find out the complete opposite. I do like strange twist in books, but this was the strangest by far.  I had heard many reviews from various people on the ending and I agree that the book did not end the way most would have liked. I personally think the author ended the book with an option to write another.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I always hate loving a song and then buying the cd and being completely disappointed. That did NOT happen here! If you like &#34;I Will Wait&#34; and &#34;The Cave&#34;, you are going to LOVE this cd! Every song is perfect; there's so much energy and the music and lyrics are incredible. I got it in the mail yesterday and have already listened to it 4 times. My only disappointment? Waiting so long to purchase it!
0553386794|5.0|When the King comes to Winterfell, Ned Stark soon finds himself given the post of Hand to the King by King Robert.  All is not well in Winterfell, however.  Stark's son is gravely injured and signs point to the King's wife's family, the Lannisters.  Stark will soon find out that when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die...<br /><br />Okay, so it's way more complicated than that but it's hard to write a teaser for an 800+ page kitten squisher like this.<br /><br />I was bound and determined not to read the Song of Ice and Fire for a variety of reasons.<br />1. I am not a huge fan of today's fantasy novels, never-ending doorstop fantasy series in particular.<br />2. The series is not yet finished and I don't want to be Dark Towered into waiting years between books or having Martin pull a Robert Jordan and die without completing it.<br />3. Hype.  Anytime someone tells me I have to read something, I almost always dig my feet in and resist.  One of these days, I'll stop being stubborn when people recommend me books.  Sure, most of them read probably 20% as much as I read in a year but there are reasons why certain books sell thousands and thousands of copies.<br /><br />So after my girlfriend and I blazed through the first season of Game of Thrones in a weekend, I figured it was time to cave in and give it a try.  My fears were unfounded.  The Game of Thrones took over my life while I was reading it.  Even after watching the first season of the TV series, I couldn't be bothered with things like cleaning house and eating properly.  I was captivated by the tale of the Lannisters, the Starks, the Targaryens, and the rest.<br /><br />I read an interview with George R.R. Martin where he mentioned liking historical fiction but hating knowing the ending before he started.  Game of Thrones feels way more like historical fiction than it does fantasy.  While there are magical elements, they don't dominate the story.  The story is the battle for the throne of the seven kingdoms and intrigue behind the scenes by various factions. It feels way more like Pillars of the Earth than it does epic fantasy.<br /><br />For me, the main strengths of the Game of Thrones are the characters and GRRM's willingness to do horrible things to them.  While fantasy is usually about good vs. evil, nothing is so black and white in the Game of Thrones.  King Robert is a man with a drinking and whoring problem.  Ned Stark fathered a child out of wedlock.  The Lannisters are a bunch of well-meaning scumbags.  Jon Snow looks down upon his companions because of his noble upbringing.<br /><br />As for GRRM's willingness to do horrible things to his characters?  Don't get too attached to anyone.  There were several shocking deaths in Game of Thrones and I'm told it gets worse from here on out.  I can't wait for someone to settle Joffrey Lannister's hash!<br /><br />For me, one of the marks of a good book is if it makes me want to rush out and write something similar.  It happened with the Dark Tower, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Elric, Hyperion, Amber, and now this.<br /><br />That's about all I can say since I don't want to give too much away.  This book is a monstrous tome but it didn't feel like it.  There's always something going on and everyone better watch their backs.  After all, Winter is Coming...ven kingdoms and intrigue behind the scenes by various factions.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I started watching this series a few weeks ago through Amazon Prime and couldn't wait for Series 3 to begin.<br />Needless to say I've watched it all and can't wait for Season 4 that starts filming in a couple of weeks. The cast and the story line are awesome and very believable. Watching Downton Abbey is like reading a book you can't put down.Definitely recommend!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is possibly on  of the best books I have  ever read. You just don't want to put it down. You dream of your own Christian. As sick as he is you love him. Fantastic
098478280X|2.0|After spending only 45 minutes with this book I could see that it was pretty much useless in preparation for any hi-tech interview -- for me, that is. The first few chapters give you an overview of what most people already know: be on time, dress appropriately, be polite and send them a thank you note. Nothing new there.<br /><br />The rest of the book is mostly an exercise in programming gymnastics and a review of a lot of obscure programming areas you probably won't remember since college: C++ and Java linked lists, binary trees, bit manipulation, recursion, etc., etc. Sure, you may use some of this stuff a lot on the job. But probably not most of it. And, while the material is a good refresher (where you can even fathom it), you can't know it all. By the time you get to the end of the material you will have to start all over again, as it could take you months to work thru & review it all (if you're just a normal person, not some geek from Mars -- you know the type). You should also be aware that other languages like PHP, Python or Visual Basic are not addressed. Not a big deal really, as the examples can apply to almost any language. But it could be important if you don't know C++ or Java.<br /><br />Let's face it. Any job interview is always a crap shoot. It doesn't matter how well prepared you are because it's all a matter of chance. For sure, the better prepared you are, the greater are your chances of getting hired. That may be reason enough for you to enjoy this book, but it wasn't for me. That's because so many other intangibles exist with the hiring process and this book only covers one small part of that process.<br /><br />My approach to interviewing, which has worked for me and is as good as any, is to just tell the interviewer that if I don't know the answer, like Einstein and his phone number, I can just look it up. That's what you'll be paying me to do on the job anyway, right? This allows me to cut right to the chase and not waste any more of theirtime, or mine. If they don't value my \\"problem solving\\" approach then I know I probably don't want to work there anyway. (Hey, works for me. Your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />Buy this book if you think memorizing a big bunch of technical answers will increase your chances of getting hired. And it may do just that. But also remember that, once you know all the answers, they may change all the questions!<br /><br />Two stars for technical content.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game. It is a fun &#34;action&#34; game. The characters are cute and funny and the scenery is great.
1451620829|4.0|I actually really loved this book.  I have been a big Kiss fan for years.  I am also a musician and sat and talked to the late Bill Aucoin a couple years before he died.  He always said that if Ace and Peter write books, you will get the real stories.  Well, I wasnt that impressed with Ace's book.  It was all over the place.  I couldn't put this one down however.  Peter dishes on everything and doesn't hold anything back.  you get stories of his upbringing, struggles, road stories, and band dirt.  He does do a bit of complaining, but its a great read.  Way better than any of the other Kiss Books and Bios that I have read...and I have read them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This amazing game I love this game so much.I have got all my friends to go on this game and they have got all their friends and family to get this game as well.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Never at a loss for something to add or keep looking at-great way to pass the time. Ulgh---I am hooked!! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This story is definitely a different kind of romance story since in his early years the main male character, Christian Grey, had a bit of an abusive type childhood. I enjoyed book two because it not only continued to hold your interest due to the sexual attraction and lust Ana & Christian had for each other, but the characters matured and helped each other grow despite them not fully realizing that this was happening. They both learn how to appreciate each other for their uniqueness and this draws them to each other on another level, a more mature relationship so to speak but you have to read between the lines to see it. Basically, there was more to the story than initially expected even after book 1.  Now I have to read book three to see how it all works out. Good Book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great series of programs. Having read all the books from beginning to end without a break in between made the anticipation for the series extreme! Recommended to anyone who is a George R R Martin fan...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I tried a sample on my kindle and was blown away by her writing style! I was hooked after the begining and HAD to see how the story unfolded. Not sure if I was going to be reading a YA, which would have been fine, but it did not present itself as such. The first chapter dropped the reader somewhere in the middle of the book at an extremely critical point. Then the author begins the story. Well, I had to find out how this story got ot THAT point! I could not imagine how the story got from point A to point Q (knowing that it was not the end of the story) with the way the story was unfolding. The clues along the way were so mysterious and disturbing at times. Instead of revealing the story as I read along, it seemed to become more and more confusing like a maze. Just as one little clue is revealed, a whole new path opens up to the point that in order to put down my kindle, I had to finish the story! It did not disappoint me. When a story takes you down a road with scenery that you are enjoying only to end up at the city dump, I end up hating the whole dang thing! But, this just got better and at the end, I wanted to immediately start it again. So I did.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig plays a classy Bond. My favorite of them all. Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Very good movie!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just like the first one this game is addicting. Can be frustrating and hard at times but I keep coming back for more. Graphics are great and seem to jump out at you.
B00A8KJK7G|2.0|Directed by Tim Burton but pretty bland overall.<br /><br />Tale focuses upon a boy who loses his dog and uses science similar to Frankenstein (hence the title) to bring his beloved friend back to life. Of course, other kids with less scruples find out and dabble into manipulating life out of their own perverse pleasures.<br /><br />There is a dark and macabre look to this picture just as usual for Tim Burton pieces. The dark rims under the eyes of almost everyone was a nice touch.<br /><br />The budget was $39M and it made a bit over $66M at the Box Office.<br /><br />ANIMATION: C plus to B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of January 2013.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Thought it was good and in-keeping with the first book. Makes you want to hurry up and read the final book!!
B0028RXXFC|4.0|This is one of the most engrossing and entertaining series we've ever seen!  It truly makes Roman history come alive--with all of its splendor--but also its seamier side-- and the political intrigues of the main characters are fascinating.  The story is told from the standpoint of two Roman Centurion friends--who are caught up in the shifting currents of Roman politics, sometimes benefiting and sometimes victimized by these changes.  As their stories play out, you witness the Roman transition from Republic to Dictatorship--and all the tumult that ensues.  The acting, staging and story-lines are first class!  WARNING - There is graphic sex and violence--probably not suitable for children under 17/18.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A wonderful, intriguing story with a good twist at the end which I did not see coming.<br /><br />A brilliant author.
0547569653|5.0|After reading this, I just want to give Scott Jurek a hug. Also the pancake recipe made fantastic pancakes (I used blueberries instead of strawberries, played with the flour proportions since I didn't have a lot of the flours he listed and added a little lemon zest). My mom raved about them. Wasn't wild about the quinoa porridge (I prefer quinoa in salty dishes). Oni giri is one of my favorite things to eat anyway. Highly recommend it as a snack or light lunch. Make with the umeboshi paste and a Japanese seasoning called furikake. really tasty.

B002ZBRSIY|4.0|I love the Ocean's movies a lot but the 2nd two pale to the first and the 2nd is the worst by far.<br /><br />This one is back to it's roots.  You have a large convoluted plan which culminates in a multi-layered victory for the heroes.  I wouldn't have it any other way.
B000YABYLA|1.0|I don't know what it is about this movie that makes it so ineffably aweful, but it is.  There are some moview that are just mean-spirited, but honest about it.  The original \\"Texas Chanisaw Massacre\\" and the original \\"The Hitcher\\" come to mind as movies that were just hard to watch.  Juno was different.  When I was watching it, it seemed okay--certainly not a good movie, but occasionally amusing. But the next day, and the day it would invade my thoughts and I'd be overcome with the same sort of soul-sucking depression that I felt when watching the Texas Chanisaw Massacre.  And it's not because of any \\"mesasage\\" the movie might have had about abortion or anything like that; it's the phoniness of the characters, the obnoxious self-conscious quirkiness, the God-awful dialog, the yellow shorts.  It's insideously corrosive, like hydrofluoric acid for the soul.  It's no mere conicidence that the author of this abomination calls hereself \\"Diablo.\\"
B002M7KHO8|4.0|There's a lot of irrelevant mind games and moralizing going on in this movie but the main character after denzel does a great job of telling the story and the pay off is worth it.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|As a user of Facebook for both personal and business reasons, this app is only slightly better than the last. A pro is that you do get more of your timeline feed, but the con is that I was still unable to view any of my listed comments or messages. They don't show up when you click in you notifications, so the post you made appears as if it's had no comments at all. Hoping that would change was why I tried this app, and I was sad to see it didn't work. So I will be uninstalling it as it is only taking up space on my droid tablet. Back to having to use my desktop for all my Facebook needs.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I heard about Fifty Shades but didn't understand the hype.  I read a sample and had to read more.  The story is very intriguing and provocative  So, I am currently reading the second book and will read the third as well.  The story pulls you in and you want to know what happens next and where is all this going.  It gives you a glimpse into the Dominant/Submissive world.  Oh and an accurate description of this book is Sex, Sex, and more Sex.  Enjoy!!

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Lots of twists and turns and things you can guess - which is fun - along with things you never will in a million years. I will say I liked the story of the first season better, but this is a nice logical extension of the franchise. Makes me wonder if a season 3 comes out what they will do with it then.<br /><br />Love the fact they bring back the whole cast from the first season! (main players anyway)

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Interesting premise on time travel and how the threads to undo the past can change the future in unbelievable ways, no matter how heroic and necessary the changes seem. A good read!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think it has a great message for people my age (I am 10 by the way) :)
B005QUQ99K|5.0|This article is what I wanted to buy, meets my expectations.<br />Also, the service is fast and secure, well packaged and protected.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was interesting and kept you reading.  Some times it was a little to much for me with all the punishment that was being delivered.  I still plan on reading books two and three.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This game deals faster than most I've played, and I like the choice of background colors and card design in this version.
0071766588|5.0|Perfect book!!! The best for to preparate the Toefl exam!!!! I recommend the official guide!!! Very nice compilation for the students.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I  loveTemple Run so I am really enjoying Temple Run 2 because it has so many new things to do that keep you wanting to keep playing. Lots of fun
1606995359|5.0|Great duck stories and color.  Good balance between longer stories and shorter strips.  I hope more volumes are coming soon.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|And I bought this one from a review I saw on the Handwritten album.  I can't remember which reviewer recommended starting with \\"59 Sound\\", but thank you!<br /><br />It's like Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen had a baby.  I REALLY like this album, and I fear change and new things.
B004SDEP38|2.0|You need to buy the full version to work it. Very disappointing. They try just to take your money. !
B008XG1X18|5.0|I get a ton of inspiration from here!  Highly recommend it it you love fashion  and art!  I love seeing what my friends are looking at and sharing new things I come across.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I can't believe how they've cleaned up this old movie.  Of course it is the greatest movie of all time, but jeez, some of the old versions of it, in theaters, on VHS or older DVDS, made it hard to appreciate sometimes.  This one looks almost perfect in every scene--and the sounds is vastly improved, too.  (I've only watched the Blu-Ray version.)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is a must for people that need to relax their brain or keep it busy while studying. It also drowns out background noise while I am sleeping or trying to study when my spouse is listening to the television.<br /><br />I love that the sounds overlap to create a wonderful blend....just the perfect way to relax after spending all day cramming for a test. I would not be without it!
B004WE01YA|2.0|I didn't realize that we had to have a3D blue ray player when I bought this DVD.  Package didn't mention we needed one.
0307346617|4.0|Excellent settings for a zombie book, as told to an interviewer. Pretty ingenious. The story line is well placed and logcal, it doesn't jump back and forth. This also leads to it's suspensefulness. I like that it's an open ended interpretation for the ending. Not really &#34;scary&#34;, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, but it was more thought provoking scariness.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I received my new Kindle Fire HD in the mail and immediately began loading the apps I wanted. I thought FB would be one. I installed it and tried to use the camera. When the camera is on, I expect to see an image as if I'm looking int he mirror. Instead, the image is upside down?! Seriously, I couldn't make this up. When I rotate the Kindle, the image rotates as well, remaining upside down. This doesn't happen when using the camera directly or when using the video camera. Must be something in the FB app.
B001CNMDYA|5.0|I LOVE THE 80's and this is a must have to your time capsule. It may seem a bit tongue and cheeky at first glance but this is a great movie with a great plot that works well for that time. There is nothing I can say bad about this movie not even Melenie G's performance. I enjoyed her part as well as the appearance from Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Salute to the 80's.
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|Chronicle was a pleasant surprise.  The weak spots in the plot line and movement was made up for by the special affects.  That is what made the movie good.  The fight scene between cousins was especially interesting.  All in all, it was an enjoyable movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing book. I read it a few times and I can't wait for the next book from Travis's prospective! I already ordered it.
B009ANP48G|4.0|You don't really watch the Step-up movies for plot, you watch it for the dancing. The group routines are outstanding, even though the rest of the movie may lack a little in script and acting. Was great to see Twitch with a larger role in this film, and even a few of the other SYTYCD alumni, such as Philip and Katherine. Worth watching, for a fun family movie.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Tht movie I orderd( The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button) was just what was shone on the sight. Love it!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|worth the time reading this novel could not wait to read more. love the story line it was great, hope there are more.
B000P2A256|5.0|MAroon 5 always good have all the cds  keep buyin them .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B007L3BMGA|4.0|this was a great book something very different for the old type of love stories, could not wait to read the next one
B00008O31H|5.0|Love all their albums. A cross between led zepplin and jimmy hendirx and joe cocker as new age rock.  The best of all worlds!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|very enjoyable, could not put it down if you liked fifty shades of grey this is just as good in my opion.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Love the mix of rockish slash blues that ryan adams gives.  Discovered him by a song playing in a movie.  Will be buying a lot more of his cds.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|this is another great book and I could not put it down. its well written and keeps you guessing. hope there are more from this author.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Hes bluesy oprah style sing is great love all his music. &#62;&#62;.... . . . . . . . . .
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire doesn't disappoint.  It kept me wanting to read more every chance I got.  The twist at the end is excellent!
B0000A5BTL|3.0|DVD played fine in my computer but is for region 2 (europe) instead of region 1 (US). Would have be nice to know about it up front.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is a good game but sometimes it freezes up and has problems. Then you can die it kinda got on my nerves but I still liked the game.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Truely giant in the industry who produced an enormuse amount of music that she either sings herself or wrote for others.  Tapestry is filled with classic Carole King at her all time best.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually love John Grisham's books. This one was just so, so for me. Seemed to take a long time getting to the whole story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|People in my school loves this game,people in my church plays it,people in my job plays this game. But I got the highest score plus it's addicting. AND I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt is a master musician.  He writes or co-writes all the songs on this album.  The songs are on the darker side but sung beautifully in his own unique fashion.  He sounds like Leo Sayer, at times, but he definitely is his own man.  I recommend this CD highly.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I purchased it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down from the moment I bought it. The book was very exciting and gave me what I was looking for in the \\"bad boy\\" romance storyline. A must read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Cool Epic Weird Scarry ( In A Way ) Awazing Killing Traps Are Too Violint Last Character Cost Too Much Involving The Prices On The Upgrades
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I like the adventures and the hidden object part is a bonus. I will recommend this game to others
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its an easy game for anyone to play. I'm paralyzed quadriplegic with partial use of my arms and hands. If I can play it. Anyone can. Its also a lot of fun.
B005LAII8K|5.0|It got here fast!! It is a good movie with some unexpected plot twists. Don't worry no spoilers here! Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon - Levitt are great!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book with many unexpected twists that I recommend to many people and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|It was shipped fast and it was a good movie!! I loved all of the action. Now I am typing because I need more words.
0385535147|2.0|Have not had a chance to read it yet. But I have all of the books that he has published so I know this one will be good as well.
B0062IQNG4|4.0|It has some very nice songs but a couple of songs I didn't care for. Some of the songs were romantic and very relaxing.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game that keeps you guessing! Many twists and turns and not too many hidden object scenes. Overall I'd recommend this game.
0525953728|5.0|Great book, I really enjoyed it.  Felt like I was there, but fortunately didn't have to be. Proud of the USA for having such dedicated military.
B001NHJTKG|5.0|One of the great albums.  The songs are bluesy, melodic, and memorable.  Contains some of the songs that made Mark Knopfler one of the greatest guitarist ever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an AMAZING game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My parents should be proud that I'm addicted to this game and not drugs! Ever since I got this game I can't put it down! This is my favorite game EVER!!!!!!! This game was brilliantly made and I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone!!!
B00004TJWE|5.0|I've been a fan from day one largely because they hail from South London and I was lucky enough to be able to sneak in and watch them at the Orpington Civic Hall by the railway station aged 12. As I read many reviews of the Pretties albums the common theme is how come they never made it big like the Beatles or Stones? Image, that's all. They did not manage their image and combine it with the music. Look how the Beatles moved from Twist and Shout in drain pipe trousers to long hair, beards and psychedelic clothes on Sgt Peppers but always maintaining the nice guy image.  Look how the Stones did the opposite, the band who peed up against garage walls and bar Satanic Majesties retained that image for decades and Keef remains someone you probably wouldn't want to take home to mum! The Pretties? Well with Dick Taylor a founder Stone on board they started out trying to out stone the Stones in terms of being anti establishment and growling and snarling at every available opportunity, but whilst SF Sorrow is a brilliant piece of music it did not fit the image and I for one only purchased it in 2012! I did not like it at the time, I liked the Buzz the Jerk Pretties. I also don't like the title \\"SF Sorrow\\" to this day. Pipers and Sgt Peppers and indeed Tommy work for me, but SF Sorrow sounds more like the name of a ship than an opera. The Stones realized their \\"error\\" with Majesties  and produced 4 of the best albums of the century, Beggars, Exile, Sticky Fingers and Let it Bleed. The Pretties produced Parachute which is for me their pinnacle and right up their with those 4 Stones albums. But after that they lost the plot. SF Sorrow? Superb if you are a fan of the Beatles, Beach Boys or Hollies, you'll love it. It is melodic, it flows, and is right up there with the albums it is often compared to being Sgt Peppers, Pipers and Tommy. However, if you liked the Buzz the Jerk type of Pretties and if you like hard blues and rock and roll then pass on this offering. Why 5 stars? Because as a piece of music it is superb, but what was incongruous was that it came from guys whose image had been to out stone the Stones and liked hammering out the blues - and their mistake was that they did not change their image to fit with the music! Enjoy!
B00A4AHZZO|5.0|Time after time we see conductors wallow through Mozart's symphonies treating them as sympathetic, dainty symphonic tissue. Here we are blessed by the presence of Klemperer giving purpose, drive, and colour to these truly classic symphonies, overtures, and serenades. This is Mozart done a certain way, surely different from the \\"sweetness\\" of Bruno Walter's Mozart and the swiftness of Abbado's. This will not to be the choice of all Mozart connoisseurs, but surely an epic interpretation of each Mozart symphony can be found within this box. Long live the emperor.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great DVD and it actually makes exercising fun, in my opinion, because Jillian is so crazy and entertaining but also motivating. It's not easy, but it's worth it. I get as many of her DVDs as I can and this one didn't disappoint.<br />However, her cooldowns aren't quite long enough for me, so I recommend doing more stretching afterward to be on the safe side.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the new subway surfers you get more mystery boxes and a lot more jetpacks and also more coin magnets and its the best game ever invented i love it soooo much!!!!!!!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Unbelievable!  Excellent product, delivered early at a good price.  Surpassed expectations for the quality.  This will be held for years as an example of what can be watched as a family in the home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love taking care of my horse Sadie shes soooo pretty even though she can get really tired sometimes though
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It has a lot of different things from the original temple run.it is very exciting and lots of fun,and best of all its free! You should get it.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Great movies!  The collection is so much better when you watch them all together.  Spent a freezing Saturday watching them all and enjoyed every minute.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of those apps that you look and just think to yourself, HECK YEAH! Fun and amazing, entertaining for all ages.
B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|When I tried to upload it to I-tunes and to my I-pad. it skips. Folks have told me record companies are doing this on purpose. I paid for this item, and should be able to play it on my own personal laptop or i-pad. If that is true, shame on the record labels.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Awesome free ap that takes the Angry Bird characters and the challenge to beat the piggies into space! Loved it!
B0067AC5KA|4.0|This series is difficult to put down;  hoping that sequel movies are made of the 2nd and 3rd in the series.  Easy to read on the Kindle, but one suggestion would be to allow the customer to break the book back into three;  it was difficult marking pages and keeping synched with such a large book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This free ap is so much fun! Goes quickly and you can get caught up in the puzzle of it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is a must read andI highly recommend it..I love this book and the series I so enjoyed every bit of this book..addicted to it...couldn't put it down..Love it
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great movie with incredible soundtrack. My toddler loved dancing to the songs. Great animation, funny movie and incredibly colorful :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really LOVED this book..very good story line, I really loved this book, hoping for book 2.....cried while reading and got lost in a great book.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Funny and good for the whole family.  Great tie in to most traditional fairy tales!  Mike meyers is awesome.  great movie
B004G8P2M8|5.0|Hammett at his best.  I have just begun to read Hammett and this was a real delight to read.  The Op is a great character.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ok.I know what you temple run fan boys like temple run brave and temple run 1.But this is by far the best of the series and that is a fact.It's so advanced giant ape, new characters, mine carts, new traps, new power ups, new colored coins,head starts just to name a few features but there's much much more.so please Imangi Studios continue the series and add much much MUCH more.So all of you temple run fans this game is HARD!!!!!!!So get your run on!
B0094HRA6M|4.0|The outter box was torn up alot...im not really picky so i dont care but my father isnt happy but the disks and everything is ok and great really!
0142420891|4.0|\\"Where She Went,\\" the sequel to [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]], is a very different story, and not only because the sequel is narrated by Adam, rather than Mia.  If you read \\"If I Stay,\\" (and if you didn't, I highly recommend it), you know that it ended with an incredible cliffhanger, and here with the sequel, we have the resolution.<br /><br />Maybe Gayle Forman has more of a knack writing romance from the male perspective, but I have a much better sense of the (former) love between Adam and Mia in this book than I did with Stay.  I just didn't really get it when Mia narrated, but with Adam, I could feel his love, his heartbreak, and his longing.<br /><br />As the title indicates, we learn what happened to Mia during the three years after she squeezed Adam's hand in the hospital bed until their somewhat chance encounter after her concert at Carnegie Hall.  Mia is now a famous cellist, and Adam is a rock star with an actress girlfriend and constantly hounded by paparazzi.  (A little unrealistic, but let's go with it.)  Mia disappeared soon after her recovery and rehabilitation, leaving a devastated Adam in her wake.  Adam is still tortured by Mia's decision, and we feel it on every page.  The tension between the two is palpable, and neither one is willing to broach the topic of their break-up.  When Adam finally explodes, we readers, along with Adam and Mia, can finally breathe.  The wall between the two is shattered, and the rest is just...beautiful.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I LOVE the sound of rain. This app has a nice alrm clock feature also. Easy to use and I really enjoy the sounds.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Seems funny i had just watched the first dredd a few days ago then i watched this version wow it was very good i enjoyed and i will watch it over again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so fast moving .'  That you were actually in the  places they. We're.  I give it 5 stars
B008MEM24S|5.0|my daughter loves these games we have all of these games as a mother I think that they should keep making these games
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put this series down. If you buy one, you HAVE TO buy all. Great for the love life at home also. :)
B0037NB6QE|5.0|I loved the book, I have read few of her other books. I like that its about several people and like continues.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Long winded drawn out, I skipped to the middle and then to the end, not a book I would recommend, just not a good read.
1401322786|5.0|Love it!  So inspiring. Definelty recommend that you read this book, it will make you have a whole new look on life
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I do not enjoy predictable books that is why<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was very well written and thought provoking.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This game requires a lot of time for the real ending, and it's worth it. The ending! It's excellent! Ahhh
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Absolutely no complaints it works good on the kindle fire and have yet to have any type of glitches. Its fun and exciting and keeps you on your toes.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This product came exactly as explained and in a very short amount of time! Would Def. order through this company again! Great product at a great price!
B00701897I|5.0|Nobody directs an action-adventure like Steven Spielberg and with Peter Jackson's company providing the amazing animation, this film is a winner.  It's probably not suitable for younger children, parents may want to consider the depiction of Captain Haddock's cartoon drunkenness (true to the books that were written decades ago) and the non-graphic violence.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This show is so addicting and fun to watch. I recommend it to everyone! I've even gotten into the books.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie had all the prospects of being great, but the movie seemed rushed to me. Possibly it should have been longer?
B006ATJXQW|5.0|James Dashner describes the emotions, actions, and appearances very well. He makes a great prequel to the Maze Runner series.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I tried to use it a few times and gave up. There is no way I would recommend it for anyone
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this app as I have trouble sleeping.  My favorites are the waves and the campfire.  I also use it for meditation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Honestly i think this game is easier than the first but that is just my opinion but yeah the game is awesome
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I have triplet boys (Three years) and they love this movie.  The music is great and they dance around the house singing the songs all the time!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I watched it alone and with my family and we all loved it immensely. It's a great family movie and has a beautiful, cute twist to a rather dark plot. The animation was beautiful and the characters were lovable. Definitely getting it on DVD.
B004SIP8BG|4.0|Its was great I lost my original copy and wanted to replace, but couldnt find it at all let alone at a good price. And here it was at a great price I love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire is a great book to read .you. Will never want to put the book down. I love this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AMAZON needs to update to Rio...love the game but would like to get all the characters and boards so please update so that I can....my son has this on his i phone and it is already updated...Same problem with Rome, but a little after I posted last time it was fixed..hopefully it works again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a good book. Funny too. The best book ever. Read this over and over again. Good book. Bye
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT WE CREATED THIS GAME BECAUSE THE OTHER GAMES WHERE BORING<br />WE ARE GONNA HAVE A NEW UPDATE NEXT WEEK.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game, so much better than the first. Great graphics, fun new challenges, an all around amazing game. My only complaint is that I wish it would let me change the sensitivity in the options.
1612680011|5.0|No page flaws. Small and light. The writer is great in delivering his lesson and his own personal experience. He talks about facts about many things in lift that sometimes our parents did not have time to teach us. Good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good and fun. Great quality.awesome character. Love all the boards. And all versions are great. Plus the mystery box's are phenomenal.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm still not seeing the flaws some people have complained about here.  The outer box is basic, but not really cheap or flimsy.  The individual disc cases and labels are perfectly adequate.  I suppose they could be even more fancy and elaborate...but do I really care?  No.<br /><br />I have no complaints about the quality of the discs or the playback.  With the first five discs the movie does start right up when you insert the disc, rather than going first to a menu screen.  Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 have proper menus that come up first, and separate special features discs with more and better extras.  But there *are* bonus features on the first five discs--trailers, deleted scenes, short interviews with cast and crew, the usual stuff.  You can access them by pressing the \\"disc menu\\" button on your remote, or you can sit through all the multi-lingual anti-piracy warnings after the end credits--the menu will pop up.  I imagine there would be more goodies on the deluxe edition discs, but I didn't pay the cost of the deluxe edition, did I?  If you're looking at this set I'm betting a lot of you don't want to, either.<br /><br />I think this *is* the region-free version that other reviewers are recommending that you order from Amazon.co.uk.  The URL printed on the disc cases is warnerbros.co.uk.  The age rating symbols on the box are the ones awarded by the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office.  After each movie ends, you see dozens of anti-piracy warnings, in every language under the sun--I've never seen that on a US version DVD.  Also, everywhere in the first film--on the packaging, on the disc, in the titles, in the dialog--they refer to the \\"philosopher's stone\\" rather than the \\"sorcerer's stone.\\"  (The original UK book title was \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" but the US publisher thought that would put off American readers, so they dumbed it down to \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\\"  They did the same with the movie so as not confuse fans of the book.  But they only changed it in the US--everywhere else it was always \\"Philosopher's Stone.\\"  Personally, I find having the movie with the original title a plus!)  The one thing I cannot find anywhere on the discs or packaging is the region code--but clearly, these are not the standard US editions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is awesome . It's easy to use. And it helps me with my homework. I totally suggest getting it. It was so good my brother wanted it.
0375869026|5.0|My daughter is a very picky reader.  She frequently picks up books to read, but rarely finishes them.  Wonder is one of those books she has read over and over again.  I think she is on her 5th reading of the book.  She loves Augie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot better than temple run. The Rio version is better also I wish I could give this game 7 stars and I am now just trying to get twenty words in because they make you
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Good cast and well acted. Violent and profane film, but totally realistic for the story line and characters. Long film, but holds interest.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so amazing and the ending, unexpected. everyone who reads this book will enjoy it...I know I loved it
B005EGXNLS|3.0|This is the first book of the series that I have read, so I am coming in in the middle as it were, but I found it reminiscent of other Cornwell books, particularly the Warlord Chronicles, back to the shield wall. Certainly not bad. The soap opera of the Saxon wars is presented neatly and with typical Cornwell skill, just feel that the autor has plowed this ground before.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Too much bad language that was offensive to some who were watching it with me.  I would not recommend it to anyone myself.  I was curious about it and that is why I purchased or rented it.  Won't watch it again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When my brother begged me to download this app, I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical. But my worries were soon forgotten! Fantastic, would recommend to anyone :-) please download it will not be a waste, I promise! Use for journeys near and far, the time will fly
B00946WMXY|5.0|gotta be a fan.  DC is not the best bond but is definitely exciting.  Way better the Tim and Pierce.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book seemed very much like the movie. I liked it. I think I would read the book first next time. Can't wait for the second one!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Here we are again...Good movie nice fx...But if you have seen and love the originals we know how it all began.  We get it...Why doesn't someone continue a story instead of rewriting it.  Movie was ok.  Just disappointed in the rewrite.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|works good. great addition to my apps. I'm sure with time it will just get better. I would recommend this app.
B00979CS50|5.0|I saw Neil Young and Crazy Horse live in November.  They played 4 songs from this CD.  That concert would have been awesome in any decade from the 60s to the present.  Neil is timeless.  This CD reflects Neils current take on things, which seems to be a reflection back to the 60s and 70s, as articulated in the opening song, Driftin' Back.  For those who caught his 2012 tour, this CD is an extension of what you experienced.  For those who did not catch Neil in concert, this CD will at least partially fill you in on what you missed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandchildren just love temple run. Temple run 2 is more challenge than the first. They also love it because it is on my kindle. I recommend the game for ages 4 and up.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|No customer support, no software definitely won't buy from globalsat was a big waste of money nothing else to say
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was a good book when it was read to me, and it's still a good book that I enjoyed reading myself  55 years later. Yes, it's a children's book, but not like Dick and Jane, this is a great sturdy story that has lasted the test of time.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The DARK KNIGHT as written by iconoclast Frank Miller gets an amazing adaptation. The two parts taken together are equal (or superior) to most of the Batman feature films. I think it's also superior to the graphic novel in some ways (I never liked Jansen's artwork-too sketchy/scratchy for my taste-all smoothed out here). The character designs & backgrounds are VERY true to the source & the dialogue & action represent the original brilliantly. Peter Weller excels as Batman/Bruce Wayne & all the other voice talent is top notch! It is VERY dark & violent so be sure to screen it prior to showing to younger kids!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Okay, this was a gift for my son. We do watch the series even though I took a strong dislike to some of the characters and wish they'd decide whether zombies can or can't open doors, pry things open or flap at them, run or drunkenly reel around. Let's face it, when all that's working in your skull for &#34;thinking&#34; is your brain stem, you're essentially walking piece of rotting meat, not Einstein. The special effects are great, and this case looks just as ucky as the guy that Andrea stuck with the screwdriver, and I'm waiting for the next season to start.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Wonderful to watch with young children or in my case great grandchildren and I also loved it.  Not only does it have good humor but teaches good life lessons.  I also loved the first one &#34;Nanny McPhee,&#34; but you don't have to see the first one to understand this one, each one stands alone. I only purchase DVD movies that I want to watch again and again, I own both Movies.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Since I love ALL the major actors in the movie and ABBA's music, I found the film highly entertaining. Merle Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski are hilarious as are Colin Firth,Stellan Skarsgård, and Pierce Brosnan- especially at the end of the movie when they are dancing onstage together in feathers and spangles! Definitely a movie to lift your spirits.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If MacGyver were an astronaut trapped on Mars.... this is a well told story. I am going to read it again because it was one of those stories I could not put down and had to find out what was going to happen next.  The Now I want to get some of the  depth I blazed past. The telling is straight forward and although there is a good bit of technical explanation of survival techniques it doesn't Overwhelm the reader.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Kept picturing Sir Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff and David Niven as Edgar, but Vivien Leigh instead of Merle Oberon as Cathy while I was reading this- again. It's still a great story, and the B&W movie is still my favorite interpretation of it.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I know Seth McFarlane's comedy isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed this movie and was glad to get it on blu ray and get a digital copy, so I can watch it on my tablet or even my phone.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This is the craziest story I've ever read.  After reading it, I looked at the world differently for a while. It's as if Phil just took me on an acid trip that is his mind. I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys weird stories.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As with any series like this, you either like it or you don't.  I find it very addictive, particularly because there are so many characters for which George R.R. Martin has fleshed out different personalities and interactions.  If you try to figure out where things are going, you will usually be wrong.<br /><br />I've been reading this during chemo treatments. I find that it really helps with the mental aspect of dealing with cancer.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game alot, but I'm finding it to be a challenge - it moves very quickly and before I know it my guy is falling down a waterfall or off a cliff!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As with any series like this, you either like it or you don't.  I find it very addictive, particularly because there are so many characters for which George R.R.

I find that it really helps with the mental aspect of dealing with cancer.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A most interesting rock n roll story!  Definitely worth seeing (and hearing the music).  A talent missed in the 60s and beyond.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As with any series like this, you either like it or you don't.  I find it very addictive, particularly because there are so many characters for which George R.R.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am a fan of Temple Run 1 and was excited to try #2. Well it exceeded my expectations and proved so addictive. I think I may have spent a day or two focused on it when it first came out. Definitely an outstanding choice.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with any series like this, you either like it or you don't.  I find it very addictive, particularly because there are so many characters for which George R.R.

B007Q0OUNA|4.0|If you are LOTR and/or LEGO fan, you're already getting this set to complete your fellowship of the 9 anyway. The set also features some good playable features,such as a trapdoor, and a set that opens and closes. There are also nice little details such as small statues, as well as the campfire scene. Also, for some reason, there are flick fire missiles.<br /><br />However, this set still feels a bit &#34;empty&#34; at times and for its MSRP, not that great of a value. A decent entry, but not amazing by any means.
B004A3KPYY|4.0|An old favorite that always helps me sleep or relax. It's very electronic sounding and one of my all time favorites.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was thinking do I really want to get this? I rarely play the first one any more...took a chance...boy what a difference. I think the only reason I put it down after 2 hours was to let the dog out. for me its a must play! more challenging and addictive!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I thought that this game would suck but I was wrong its an awesome game you have to buy it!! By the way a goo seed is nyan
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is way cooler than the first temple run. graphics are way better way more obstacles and just way cooler I recommend this app to everyone.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I've read it when I was 12, then I 've re-read it in University and now I am 32 years old and I am reading it again. That's gotta tell you something! Brilliant!
1449410243|5.0|A great book! Well worth the price and quite hilarious. We like to leave it on our coffee table so that guests can have a good laugh when they visit.
B00065U08Q|5.0|I am a fan of Frusciante and love his work with Josh. I think this album would appeal to a wider audience (opposed to some of his other material) but one should be open-minded because it is John:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|gosh what is not to love about this game. oh yeah that's right nothing is un loveable about minecraft. I mean seriously youncan hug creepers
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Always at the edge of my seat watching these episodes. So happy its on Instant Video on Amazon. Can't wait for Season 3 on Amazon!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this app Friday night (release day) and played it that night.  I played ot Saturday morning andnall was fine. that afternoon it gave me the opening page and then closed. I figured it was just a temporary glitches, but it has lasted 5 days and counting. besides that glitch, it is a fun game!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wicked game it's a really fantastic game brilliant and you can change characters,<br />Cool game I'm definitely a fan awesome.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I do love this app but sometimes I am not sure where my pins go after I pin them<br />still love it!
B0061S073A|5.0|I like that I can let my grandson play with my kindle, and it allows him to play only with what I've put in the kids place app.
B0086449YA|5.0|My son loved this CD..was on his christmas wish list.. I have always had good luck when i order music from here
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive. I can't stop. I just want to keep going. Keeps your brain thinking. My daughter got me hooked.
B0055S348W|5.0|I was able to print my email from my kindle without any problem. Excellent product and easy to use without any help.
B007XIC1GI|2.0|Although not a huge fan of Manson, thought the book would be much better. Seemed just a clinched rock star book. Nothing earth shattering here. Not terrible, but nothing great either. Read my share of music biographies and autobiographies, not all if the subjects was I a fan, this was just okay, if you are a fan you will most likely enjoy it.
0761171703|5.0|I purchased copies of this book for my entire faculty.  A fun book for anyone but especially appreciated by dancers young and old.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott has done a good job explaining his route to his current success.  I became familiar with his story in other publications so this was a good addition.
1574214276|5.0|I purchase several of these books for nephews, son-in-laws and grandchildren.  Along with a set of pens, this made a nice gift.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|good book but a little predictable in spots  I was able to finish it in only two days. Very intertaining
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator. Nice and simple. Nice sized &quot;buttons&quot;. Easy to see. If you are looking for a good, easy to use calculator to use for everyday , then this is the one for you.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of my favorite movies and the blu ray sound and picture is unmatched compared to the DVD. Plus this one has lots of great behind the scenes stuff that I enjoy.
B003UUFHHS|4.0|It is the music from the TV special. Typical Leonard Cohen, songs I heard before and it was what I expected. It is a little hard to hear, and I am not sure if it is the recording or his voice quality.
B003QCNFN8|5.0|We bought this at least a year ago and it's still in our music rotation. My favorite song is &#34;Life won't wait&#34;.
B0052GACNM|5.0|It's one of the best. I play this CD in my car, and several people who have listened to the music loved it. I bought extras for Christmas presents!
B00136Q1I0|5.0|My husband I have been listening to this a lot. &#34;Everybody has a hungry heart&#34; has been stuck in my head for 2 days now. :)
B0067R0APK|5.0|This app  is great and very accurate.  It. Is easy to use and maneuver around the site.  AccuWeather  Platinum works way better than the typing correction program to write this review!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Wow, this book grabs your attention right away and never slows down.<br />Would definitely recommend it to everyone. LOVED IT!
B000V39KDO|5.0|the best jaw dropping, ear splitting, heart beating, movie ever. extremely inspiration and epic graphics. I wish it was longer!!! go sparta!!!!!<br /><br />warning the explicit content was unnecessary and took away from the fun of the film. I wish that it had been taken out.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|If you like Rod Stewart, you'll enjoy this.  His deep, raspy voice make for a nice & different take on Christmas Carols.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I thought it was very entertaining. However, I expected it to be a musical. I loved the animation. I was a little disappointed as I expected it to be more like the original storyline.<br />My favorite version is Scrooge, the musical.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great for listening to radio on your mobile device.  Especially nice for news headlines.  Have it on my phone an tablet.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Putting Ben and Charlie together really works fantastically.  I was surprised at how traditional they managed to keep the album.  Really great music!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This app is perfect for any piano player, or anyone interested in playing the piano. The full version is even better than the free version because it gives you 20 more songs and it also shows the name of the notes on the keys. Dont hesitate to buy this!! i love it
1590171993|5.0|This book is a work of quiet beauty and expert craftsmanship. I found myself copying whole paragraphs into my journal, so that I can savor them again. If like me, you have never heard of this book, maybe, like me you will be totally swept away by the beauty of the language and the quality of the writing. Wonderful book.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|If you like T&S or just solid, catchy rock/alt/pop, you'll love this album. It's a new take on their typical staccato rhythms and thrifty lyrics, with a new mix of synthesizers and 80s electric feel. Get it.
0345803485|5.0|So my friend kinda forced this book on me. (sparing the details), I started reading the first book, and within one week I finished all three. I never entertained romance novels, but I really enjoyed this series once I looked beyond the cliches (which this book had alot of). Nontheless, I really became captivated by the story and I could not put this book down. I enjoyed the characters, especially Christians development through the series. It was way more than just the sex. I actually enjoyed the plot and it became a page turner for me. I know people critized the book for bad writing. I dont know, it seems snobbish to me. Take this book for what it is, purely for entertainment and fantasy. If you get SO hung up on the irrelevant literary elements of this book, then I think you need a Christian in your life. I thought this book was fun! I would def. recommend it. The last book left me hanging though and I am hoping that there will be a book from Christian's perspective. I think it would be so much more fun to read it through his eyes. I would reread the whole book, if it was all his perspective!
B000I2JI80|5.0|Have a Holga camera and need this type of film in it. Fuji seems to make some good film and works well.
1609611543|5.0|This book is outstanding! The author, Dr. Davis, explain very carefully why the wheat that we eat now, and for the past 30 years, is causing us to become obese. Modern wheat hybrids yield high quantities, but these changes have now made our blood sugar soar due to insulin spikes and the resulting low blood sugar, which makes us hungry-AGAIN. After the explanation, Dr. Davis gives us wonderful recipes, with amazing photographs, of all the foods that we can eat. I am eager to purchase the alternative flours (almond, flaxseed, etc.) to bake my own breads and other delicious goodies. I've been using the Wheat Belly program about 2 1/2 weeks now and have lost 8lbs. I'm 65 and most-probably have metabolic syndrome. This program is the only one that has worked for me in years. I'm convinced that wheat is causing our inability to lose weight, mainly because we're always hungry. Well, not anymore! Thanks to Dr. Davis and his careful research, it's now possible to drop those unwanted pounds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great. Me and all of my cousins and my mom play this game 24/7. I wish that all games were as fun as this one. Right now this game is my new favorite out of all of the games that are on my tablet.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am highly addicted to this game, it's so much fun! The only negative comment I have: when I die, if I use a jewel to continue where I died, a lot of times it will take my gem and force close the game.  Very frustrating. Otherwise this would be a 5-star rating!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant game enjoy for hours and trying to beat your own score and friends aswell you get to play friends on facebook great graphics and choose from plenty of boards and guys in the shop
B008OOYALE|5.0|love the game. the colors. the different. dragons you can get and breed and the fact that you gist other players games
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Creepy--far better than season 2.  Characters are flawed in so many intricate ways.  Worth the time to watch how and what the house is.
1444737112|5.0|Excellent book free from complicated writing, just the facts ! and very rewarding facts they are too.<br /><br />Of course being a lover of ginger cats as I am does help, but still, everyone should read this book and learn how vital the love of an animal was in pulling the writer out of the pit of his drug addiction.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I am NOT a reader.  But my daughter got this book for Christmas and I decided to buy the e-version so we could talk about it together.  What a good TRIP.  Great story.  Fun.  NOT SCARY---more like a great magical Harry Potter Like Book.
B001KK052W|5.0|this season  is the best.  it is witty and funny. i especially like allen, kind of a dufus.  jake couldn't be played better.  this child actor comes across as a real person in the series.  the comedy is delivered by all in a flawless manner.  a little risque, but this season is the best, 1-4.

068817776X|5.0|This is a wonderful memoir. I felt like I sat down with Edith and she told me her story.  I couldn't put it down, and devoured the whole thing in one day.  Wow, what a good read!
0425263908|3.0|After reading Fifty Shades Trilogy by E L James, I decided to read Sylvia Day Bared to You.  Because I read that  Fifty Shades readers should read this book. At the beginning of Bared to You by Sylvia Day is half way was very similar to Fifty Shades Grey written by E L James. I heard it was going to be similar to 50 shades and I was expecting more of a difference. The characters in this book, compares to 50 Shades. But the contrast is that Gideon Cross cared so much for Eva in so little time. Also Eva was stubborn and really spoke her mind. After reading the first five chapters, I thought about putting the book down and stop reading it because I felt like the ideas were copied off of 50 Shades. Also I felt like the book wasn't very descriptive.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It took me a few chapters to really get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down. Nice story flow didn't go to fast or to slow. Loved how it ended!!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best book I have read about our solar system exploration ever. Totally believable and brilliantly written. This guy knows his science. Why don't NASA employ him to lead the first Mars expedition.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Some of the ways Lee describes the fight/killings in this book are beyond words I can't even quote it! Great book sad plot but Reacher is my new favorite character to read about.
B000077VR3|5.0|This was a gift for the granddaughter, loves it and it came in plenty of time to wrap and mail off
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am a Lincoln nut, so anything concerning Lincoln I automaticaly read.  This book is a long one and I am only 51% through.  It is well written and seemingly well researched.  I would recommnend this book before reading &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34;.  the lives and characters that were Lincoln's rivals are very well presented.  Who ever really heard of Seward, Chase, Blair, Stanton, etc.?  Once you have read this book you will feel like you have met them personally.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Gift for granddaughter, she LOVES this move.  It came in plenty of time to wrap and get it off in the mail.
B00913P6G0|5.0|And this should be nominated for a Best Album of the year as well. This album is nearly perfect and the best album to come from a hip-hop artist in a long time. Finally a rapper has dropped an album better than his mixtapes, which has been an awful trend.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|this a good game that memes you keep changing and thinking ahead.  recommend to atleast try it.  freezes and boots you out some times.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I tagged one song on Shazam a couple of weeks ago and it lead me here. I was surprised to hear all the songs I remember from my mid-childhood. The album was compiled in the 90's, but I believe most of the songs became hits in the mid to late 80's. Anyhow, I love this album because it is a classic pop/rock album. Enjoy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I loved this as much as the original one!  I'm not as good at it as my son, but it's super fun!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put the book down.  The diary approach worked well to build up suspense.  Psychological portraits well developed.  Will read more Gillian FRlynn.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son downloaded this game for me to try.  It was my first Angry Birds experience and I love it!!
0679882820|3.0|This little board book, like the others in the Dr. Seuss collection, is abbreviated, but it's fine for young babies.  For toddlers and older, though, the full-length, non-cardboard versions are much more interesting.
B002QP145C|2.0|An accurate depiction of a brief period of Finnish history. I give it a low rating because the indoor scenes do not have true color.<br />I was charged postage for this DVD.  It was advertised as free shipping.
B0085FF55W|5.0|I purchased this CD mainly for the song Hero after I heard it on the radio.  The entire album is very enjoyable, and the song styles are varied.  I wish a few more of the songs were of the style of Hero, quiet and acoustic.  But all in all, I'm very happy with the album.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Gotta rumble.  Best to have 2 to 4.  L2 & R2 kind of a step back from usability of them on PS2.  Price always feels high, so I watch for price drops (especially for controllers after the first).  Size is just right for me.<br />The whole eye & move just have not replaced or bettered this.  Wheels and peddles do for a few racing games.<br /><br />I miss the see thru black of the original sixaxis.  I wish this came in that color.  I'd like more colors, but I haven't seen any I want.  One of the sticks is a little stiff and slightly sticks.  My other one didn't require that break in.<br /><br />I love how these can be used with a PC, too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would say that Pinterest is the most used app on my device. It is so addicting. Try it!! You will be glad you did!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Good screenwriting in a fun action flick, plus good fun for any marvel fan.  I didn't know all the characters but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying.
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you like your thrillers on the scary side, you will love this one. A happy if unikely adventure goes terribly wrong.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|I enjoyed this film immensely. The characters are very real and identifiable and have each have their own complex issues they're dealing with.  Many high-school dramas are either too sappy, or too horrific and heart-wrenching. Though what the protagonist and his friends go through is not easy by any means, it leaves the viewer with a feeling of up-beat optimism that even though terrible things can happen to us, it's important to not dwell on it and move on with your life, as it is &#34;infinite.&#34;
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea is my passion - I love all of his music and concert performances.  I think I own all of his CD's and DVD's and spend much time listening and watching.  I was so fortunate to see him live in Boston a few years ago, an unforgettable, beautiful experience.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Take temple run add updated, sharper,  better graphics. Add more dangers like fires, cliffs, spikes, and a large gorilla. Add zip lines and trains. Shake it all up and you get this great game. I think it's harder but I'm old. My young daughter likes it very much so I recommend this game.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great film exploring the inevitable adjustment of senior citizens to retirement and new lifestyles.  A serious treatment of sensitive issues lightened with amusing situations and dialog.  I recommend this film to everyone.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love his dialogue and the comfort he feels with his characters. Maybe Harry's partner could have more of a role, that would be my only input to making it a little better.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a good read about not just what happened in the mission but the work it took for the author to get there.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Very wordy, almost like a play. The characters don't take on much of a personality and the beginning is confusing. It doesn't take off into a great mystery thriller.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|For a simple guy doing simple VO work, mainly audiobooks, this did the trick. Works great and gives a nice sound. Most importantly it works with pc or Mac. Since I just switched from pc to an iMac that was a money saver as some interfaces don't work with one or the other well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER. EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sweet game. Not like pc. Not that detailed. But it is sweet. It is nice and portable.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|There couldn't be a need for more variety in the rain sound effects department. If you aren't afraid of water you should enjoy this app. It has a chance to soothe a cranky newborn baby too. 3 stars for looping too frequently.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was very pleased with the DVD. Had read the book, but wanted to add this to my favorite<br />DVDs. I have watched it several times!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Honest, heartwarming, and humorous. I fell in love with Pat and Tiffany right away. I saw the film first and expected differences There are many and as expectes I enjoyed getting the whole story and all the intricacies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down for a second! There was never a good stopping point and I would go to work tired the next morning from staying up too late reading this book!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love the way he intertwines history with his fictional characters.  Loved Fall of Giants and am equally fascinated with book 2, Winter of the World.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|You must get this game. It has so much more item upgrades and things like that. I think you really should get it<br /><br />Gangnam
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is fun game where you surf the trains of New York. You collect coins and mystery boxes and power ups. I suggest that you get this app and if you have an Facebook u can compete with friends.I hope you enjoyed this.<br /><br />  By Sammy age 10
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but how do you update it? I really need to know so can anyone help me please
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really awesome job to play you can also use next city should be in Alaska or in Florida
0061537969|5.0|read it ! and find out for yourself !<br />Very dramatic story,  with Zen like perceptiveness.<br />it makes you cry out loud. but when you finish reading ,<br />you will have a smile on your face
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Ian McEwan's work, and couldn't wait to read \\"Sweet Tooth.\\" I must confess that I found the first two thirds of the book confusing, boring and frankly, I didn't care all that much about the characters. I thought the final third of the book really redeemed the story. The end surprised me. But it was a bit of a slog to get there. The notion of espionage being the ultimate aphrodisiac is an interesting one, but somehow, it just didn't play out that way for me in the early going.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed book 2 can't wait for book  3 I hope it will be as good as the last 2
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't even like Zombies. But this show is so much more. I just discovered it a few weeks ago. I devoured to first two seasons and just got the third from Amazon. I can't wait until it continues in February. If you love great drama, you'll love this! I can't say enough wonderful things about it.
B008WOULPK|5.0|I was so sad when the book ended. Grace made me feel like I knew her for ages. She's funny and certainly not afraid to tell it like it is! I read this simultaneously with &#34;A Beautiful Fall&#34; so sometimes the &#34;characters&#34; overlapped. Truly, fact is greater than fiction!
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|It pains me to say this, but Amazon/PBS/CarnivalFilms are playing us for fools. Back in November, I purchased the UK version through Amazon UK to watch on my region free DVD player. I was very happy with it, but I was still looking forward to receiving my blu-ray version and watching it in high def.<br /><br />When I watched it on PBS, I was stunned to see (edited: a good 8-10 additional scenes that were not shown in the UK version), and the whole series hasn't even been shown yet. I never dreamed that the Blu-Ray released would not be the full version but I went to watch it tonight and lo and behold, it's the version with the missing scenes. I am returning my disks ASAP and hoping they release the full version soon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series has got to be one of the finest production in a long time. The story line, cast and atmosphere really bring in the viewer into their world. I highly reccomend.
006097625X|3.0|At the risk of pissing off a lot of Scott's fans out there, I felt compelled to write a review of this book, based on the fact that there are a surprising amount of five-star reviews, and I just can't figure out why. Now, please understand I think it's great his book found an audience, and I actually just ordered his \\"Making Comics\\" book. However, here are some of my thoughts on this book:<br /><br />*If anyone has read comics any significant amount, a huge portion of this book will be completely redundant and unnecessary.<br /><br />*His approach seems to be \\"the only reason people don't like comics is because they simply don't understand them.\\" Well, it's not rocket science. If people don't like comics, it's probably because they simply don't care for the medium. I can't imagine how explaining things in EXCRUCIATING detail is going to suddenly change their mind. His other approach is to justify the medium itself as a valid and important art form. I agree that it is both those things, but to create a whole book on that premise is again (I feel) barking up the wrong tree. If people don't like comics, why would they read a whole book on the subject?<br /><br />*There certainly is some nice information in this book, particularly the historical info on comics. But, as a whole, it feels padded and bloated with things that most people would already know, or just not care about.<br /><br />All that being said, it is obvious that he has indeed found an audience, and I can't (and wouldn't want to) change that. My only concern is that some people might think this book is something that it's not (for instance would-be comic creators, like me) and may read it and be disappointed. That's what happened to me, so I have ordered one of his other books. I think it would help if amazon allowed people to look at the table of contents before ordering, but at present there is no option to do that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun and my children love it. I would highly recommend this game to horse lovers of all ages.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book takes you for a ride that we will never take.  Thanks to Mark for his sacrifice and for sharing.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Nice app.  Easy to use and very functional.  You won't be sorry with this app.  I am using this app on my Kindle Fire and it works well!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you see this game you have to get it cause it is so fun and always play on it.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Very intersting read. I enjoyed the book from beginning to end. I think some of the myths got clarified for me.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I have all of Hayao Miyazaki's best known animated features, but had not really heard much about this early effort.  I was intrigued because one source said that Miyazaki named Studio Ghibli after the Italian plane which appears in this movie, so I bought it.  The movie proved to be classic Miyazaki:  one enters the story seemingly in the middle, there is a level of humor, danger, fantasy and mystery, and true loss.<br /><br />The animation is incredibly rich with the usual attention to detail, and colors remain vivid.  The story is compelling, but for audiences inexperienced in Japanese cinema it may be a little unsettling in that not all questions are answered.  The movie is lively and funny, but the flashbacks are emotionally powerful.  Once again, the soundtrack contributes powerfully to the mood in those scenes.<br /><br />Some reviewers of other Miyazaki movies released in the US have complained about the use of Hollywood stars for the voice talent, but honestly I haven't found that to be an issue, or distracting.  In many cases, unless one looks at the voice talent in advance the viewer would not be able to connect most voices with the star.<br /><br />Not as well known as &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34;, &#34;Spirited Away&#34; and &#34;Whispers of the Heart&#34;, &#34;Porco Rosso&#34; is worthy of being included with those movies.  Any fan of Miyazaki's work will enjoy this movie.
6305212112|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Reminds me of all the things good in life, and some really fantastic times.  For 5 bucks I couldn't ask for anything better!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Nothing much to recommend....if you are a Columbo fan<br />you will be very happy with this complete series. Quality<br />is excellent...audio fine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game and good graphics. Extremely entertaining though diamonds are hard to get. If one thing could be changed is a little easyer to get the diamonds or more ways to get them.
B005IQZB14|5.0|one of those that the subject didn't interest me. my sister encouraged me to read it and i was really surprised by how much i loved this book.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence and the Machine has an edgy dark side that really gets me working and my frustrations out when working on a tough project.
B006LSZECO|5.0|lots of twists and turns.  every time i thought i had it figured out, it would twist again.  the ending was a surprise and thoughtful
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game. Some of the areas are tricky for me to tell whether to jump or go under but that is part of the challenge.  I'm interested in possibly geting the update of this one.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Don't know if it was because I wasn't expecting much to begin with but thourghly enjoyed this film.  Give it a shot.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I had trouble downloading this and everytime I try to use it, it won't work. I would appreciate it if customer assistance would instruct me in how to either make it work or clearing it off my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good graphics and presentation. Takes a while for things to get completed unless you are willing to pay for it with actual money.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This story completely swept me away. I almost missed my subway stop several times because I wanted to keep reading. The world and characters Morgenstern creates are compelling and irresistible. Her use of multiple points of view and times jumps effectively added to the mystery and suspense of the novel. Although the novel certainly employs liberal use of magic, the overall feel is more magical realism than fantasy. You would love this book if you enjoyed The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A page turner in every sense of the word.  Dan Brown has never let me down when looking for great subjecy matter, mystery and little known facts.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|in the worst way possible. I was wary of buying a book about a terminally ill teen falling in love because it's so easy to fall in the the sentimental &#34;Walk to Remember&#34; trap. But I bought the book because several of my guy friends told me they couldn't believe how clever and funny it was. One of my friends even confessed it made him weep and affected his view on life.<br /><br />What a mistake. There were several times as I was reading on the subway that I had to slam the book shut and mutter, &#34;This is so unrealistic. This is so idiotic.&#34; Everyone in the book speaks like over-pretentious Diablo Cody characters living in the melodramatic world of Nicholas Sparks. I could go into more detail about what I didn't like, but I feel other reviewers have already said it just as well. I suppose the book's worst crime is making the characters so smart and witty that they don't seem likable or, for that matter, human. Also: the fact that half the content of this book is summarizing the plot of books or movies like V for Vendetta. The readers don't need summaries of stories by other authors--we just need one really good story from the author at hand. Felt like reading a book report at times.<br /><br />Although the first few pages held promise, I hated the book by the end of the first chapter. I'm sorry to trash John Green, but this is the first time I've ever felt the need to publicize how much I disliked an overrated book.
B005CVWWJY|4.0|it was a really amazing and interesting book, posed many questions for what the future of earth may be like.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching on recommendation of a friend.  Got hooked pretty fast.  Refreshing to watch a period series with such good and accurate content.  Hope they keep going.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Can't wait for #3!!  This movie is as good, if not better than the first.  Good pairing of actors. Great plot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I find this game pretty fun for Ipads, IPod touches, and other devices. It has good graphics. The only sad part is that the tack costs a lot. Same if you want to buy a new horse. But it's still really fun!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is def one of my favorites!! This is my second time playing! Awesome graphics and story line. Well worth the price! Recommend to anyone who loves hidden object games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would recommend this novel to those looking for sheer entertainment.  Although I enjoyed it, I was disappointed with the ending.  I may have also been a little disappointed because friends described it as &#34;the best book they had every read,&#34; and I expected more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|a good game to bypass some time but interesting keeps you playing cause your wondering what's in the next room.
B000002J0N|5.0|I enjoyed this album thoroughly over the summer, was nice to brush up on some old CSN stuff.  I think I prefer their older music.
B0086700CM|3.0|it was fun and all when i got it but what is wrong about it is you get bored playing 5 sec. into the game not cool do not get unless you are VERY bored
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I have always enjoyed hearing a Rihanna song over the radio or out and about but never enough to purchase her material. Her lyrics are often lacking in depth and her songs are all the same but I was pleasantly surprised with this album. She really took it up a notch and I'm glad I purchased the whole thing.
B000001EYO|5.0|Good music from a great movie.  I don't have fourteen more words to say, but they require me to write them.  Weird.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading Rowling's first foray into adult literature. I have read all of the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them all. &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; starts and ends with funerals, and it has no joy in between. The characters are finely drawn, but the only likable one has died before the book even begins. I was disappointed in it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was sooooooo funny and it is not a waste of money only problem is that the book goes really fast one reason I thought that was because it was on kindle fire because you can take the  kindle everywhere. All in all great book
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has not let me down in book two of the Century Trilogy.  Left me wanting to have Book Three in my hands as I turned the last page.  This series could go on for another millenium.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic, fun, and entertaining but I do not like how expensive everything is and how all the awesome stuff costs gems instead of coins.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Again, Mitch Albom has delived a very thought provoking read.  Although it was slow developing, the end result made me sit back and think about all those items that keep track of time.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Probably some of the best music from an era of really good music. Written by a tail-ender baby boomer (in other words, a little biased). Listening to this download (we used to call them albums) brings back a flood of memories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loving this game! Very addictive and great fun.lots of different characters and boards to aim for. A lot of missions to conquer, and surprises along the way. I've just been transported from New York to Rio and am loving the change of scenery. Great for mums like me, kids and oldies, give it a go!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast passed and very believable, felt for the characters.kept me on the edge of my seat the while time. Would recommend
B007KOLNXC|2.0|I thought that I would be able to stream these videos, and I am used to occasional loading screens when using my xbox to watch movies online, but I have never had such a hard time watching and online video before.  A loading screen popped up nearly every 15 seconds and makes the series unwatchable.<br /><br />And it is not my internet connection because I tryed both netflix and hulu tuesday and wednesday after I was having troubles watching the video and they worked seamlessly.<br /><br />I am upset that I payed so much for this and I cannot even watch it properly.  I hope that the viewing experience get better in the next few days and that amazon instant works better.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game ok it is kinds hard dome of it nut mot all of it dome it id kinds eady
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love love love this show!! The well written script/storyline. great costumes and set design. the acting is great! If you love period dramas then Downton Abbey is a must for your collection!
B005I4JG80|5.0|An insightful, humble, entertaining look at the current state of American/Anglophone parenting through the eyes of an American mother living in Paris.  As a mother of a young child myself, I think this book is an important, timely commentary on how norms and expectations have gotten a bit out of balance in our guilt ridden, over-analyzed, over scheduled American parenting culture, and how we might learn a thing or two from French parents and also appreciate some aspects of American culture that we take for granted.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|For a few bucks, it'd be hard to pass up a deal like this. Two discs, a digital copy, and sweet packaging for only $3?! And just in time for Into Darkness. A++ deal
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free flow is one of the moost interesting and challenging games I have played. As I got farther into the game I found that it got harder to figure out  the challenges.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This tells the self-published author everything he or she needs to know in order to publish on Kindle.<br />Clearly written, well indexed and accessible.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Talking tom is one of the highlight of my day and I love when whenever I say something he says it in a much higher pitch
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Buy it. love it. will be listening to this one alot. Thanks Chino and company. Love your melodies, lyrics, very great sounding album, hats off to the producer as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wonderful gameplay and graphics. I enjoyed the first version, and I can say that I've enjoyed Temple 2 a lot more. Better challenges and more fun!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey´s prose is fantastic. More than any other book in recent memory I found this series harder and harder to put down.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks books, this one just made me love them even more. He writes with so much passion and heart. You feel the same pain Katie does and see into the twisted mind of her abusive husband Kevin. This book is a treasure!
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Why do bad things happen to bad people?  Imagine \\"Double Indemnity\\" spun out of control beyond all pretense of being a 'civilized' film noir - a \\"film sanglant\\" if you will.  Sadistic violence, Lolita-esque nymphet lust, corruption, deception, adultery, betrayal, and a Grand Guignol finale - I just loved this movie!  The acting was superb, the direction excellent, the screenplay provocative and the pace of the film took me on an inevitable, doomed journey of annihilation and destruction.  That's what film noir in general is all about, and this film in particular is an entertaining and exhilarating ride straight to hell.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the best one so far in the series slash next series but not at good as Athens Mark
0451216725|4.0|The book takes off from a familiar launching pad: Our protagonist, \\"Luke\\" (Dr. Claude Lucas, we later find out), awakens one morning with no knowledge of who he is, where he came from or what he's doing in a restroom in Union Station dressed like a bum. His story begins as a quest to find out who he is, but develops into much more, taking us into the post-Sputnik space race, Cold War espionage, murder, betrayal, intrigue, and draconian brain-tampering.<br /><br />It's been a while since anything spewed out by traditional publishing has grabbed me so effectively as this book did. I actually got angry when distracted or I had to put it down to deal with work, family, etc. I found it that good. Follett's use of flashbacks was deft, if not masterful. And by that I don't mean they were all part of some gimmick or contrivance to trick the reader. He used them to develop the characters, and it worked well. I cared about Luke and Billie because of those.<br /><br />There were surprises, to be sure. And though Follett's view of history has been colored by revisionism (as has most everyone's educated in government schools), there was no huge political sucker-punch waiting for me at the climax. Quite the opposite.<br /><br />There are flaws. The most bothersome to me are the conventional plot devices which depend on the hero's gullibility. But those are few and mostly plowed to the end of the plot line.<br /><br />This Cold-War thriller gets an enthusiastic recommendation from me.<br /><br />Henry Brown is the Two-Fisted Blogger and author of pulpesque men's fiction including the paramilitary adventures Hell & Gone and Tier Zero.
B005LAII12|5.0|Classic &#34;Family Guy&#34; humor. Prepare to be offended. Laugh out loud funny. I need to type 8 more words so here you go.
0545265355|5.0|at the time I purchased this set, even Costco was more expensive. and Costco usually has waaaay better deals than anywhere. its been while since I bought these but I wanted to leave a review anyway. fast shipping. great price. LOVE HUNGER GAMES!!!
B001IMFHTS|4.0|Very good value and amazing music. I had been waiting a long time for the opportunity to jave the full set.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|all Dr Pandas Apps are great for preschoolers and i have them all,it hard to find apps for our sons tablet that arent for adults or older children and he luvs them thanks!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just read it. The story telling is wonderful and the &#34;voice' is special. You'll enjoy it and remember it. Really.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Heart warming & suspenseful. The love story between Katie& Alex is what we all long for.<br />Can't wait to see the movie
0307279189|5.0|I hate running--and even I loved this book! A friend told me her husband LOVED this book, although he LOVES running, but I bought it for a gift and decided to read it too. It reads really fast, and it's super interesting--I think everyone should read this book! It's not just for runners--it's really about how all humans are &#34;Born to Run!&#34; And while it did not motivate me to become an ultramarathoner, it completely changed how I think about running
B005JABU82|5.0|The Freedom Gundam is one of, if not my favorite Gundam so I wanted a kit that looked cool and this was the one. besides having some features not even the master grade has, like the wing split, and what not even the 1/60 scale had, it was one of the best purchases that I have ever made. The very first Gundam model I purchased was the High Grade, 1/144 scale Freedom Gundam and fell in love with it. Comparing this real grade to the high grade however, there is no competition. It comes with two beam sabers, a rifle, a shield, and different hands. One of the greatest things about the real grade line is the Master Grade type frame that goes into the real grade. It has a lot of articulation, looks awesome with no panel lining, using a marker to line the various little crevices of the model to make it pop more, or painting, and it looks incredible overall. If you want to get a kit but don't know if it is the right one for you, youtube has some good reviews on models to help you make your choice. A few notes: you need a specific action base to attach the Freedom onto; This is a model kit, not a toy so if it falls, it will probably shatter into a million pieces.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If you read the first of the triligy, you'll know what to expect of this one. I found this 2nd book to be a more tedious read, although more of the love scenes, so if you like that, you might not find this book so tedious. I told a friend to convince me to read the 3rd one, and she did, and I'm glad I pushed through. It is a great love story, and it's well-conveyed in this book.
B00005N5S5|5.0|price was great. product was good quality and I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to any one
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Exactly what you would expect from a Nicholas Sparks novel--great characters, fast read, romantic story....and suspense! He's great at writing that style, and even people who aren't previous Sparks fans could love this book
B001OQCV2E|5.0|price was great. product was good quality and I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to any one
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am really enjoying the new one. a few minks need to be worked out but other then that its a cool game
B001VLBDD0|5.0|price was great. product was good quality and I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to any one
1616284382|5.0|The book details the making of Snow White from conception to reception. All of the main characters are given comprehensive coverage, as are the various scenes from the film. Highly recommended.
B00005JM0B|5.0|price was great. product was good quality and I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to any one
B009IQG5LK|3.0|I remember seeing this in the cinema when it was first released - at the time I thought it was an interesting way to interpret a comic strip, but it was a little cheesy. Lots of big names, too many average songs, and Beatty and Madonna. Not to everyone's taste.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|As I was watching the film, I was underwhelmed and not impressed. I thought it SUCKED actually, then the ending was a nice surprise. I would have given it one star had it not been for the fairly decent ending. There were some slow parts throughout the movie. This is no &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; or &#34;Die Hard&#34; if you're used to Bruce Willis being fully loaded on high octane. Bruce Willis actually shows a softer side in this movie. Three stars - you just have to get to the end to really appreciate it.
1451695195|5.0|Absolutely star studded captivating writing.<br /><br />I have reccommended this book to nearly everyone I know.  Even to people i didn't know.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is like any other competition movie, think, \\"Bring It On\\", \\"Drumline,\\" etc.  What makes it different from other competition movies is the differences among the members of the group.  This group actually celebrates people being unique and not the cookie cutter blonde model.  There's women of all shapes and sizes and there's diversity of color.  This movie reminded me of TV show Glee for that reason.  Great singing.  Good humor.  4 stars.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The boys got bored with this pretty fast, but I like it. A basic matching game but fun to try and beat your best time. Fun, quick game.
B00ARAO720|3.0|We've already seen vehicle chase movies. The only difference with this one is that the protagonist is on a bike throughout the movie. The plot is okay, somewhat believable, but sometimes I had questions like, &#34;really? There was no other service to use in New York. . . The cop is dirty, obviously, so why not just report him to Internal Affairs?&#34; Those loose ends grated on my nerves. Other than that the movie was okay. No overt sex scenes. Good moral of the story; although, the movie can be violent at times.<br /><br />One good thing about the movie - it made me interested in biking again. 3 stars!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is actually a very hard game but my boys love it and my 5yo is great at it. Physics and problem solving in a very cute package. They don't even realize they're learning.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I'll admit it: the first Muse song I ever heard was \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", and I heard it on the soundtrack for the video game \\"Guitar Hero III\\". Kind of a lame origin story for what would become my love affair with Muse.<br /><br />Before I knew it, I owned all 4 released (at the time) studio albums from Muse and I listened to tracks completely out-of-order, etc. It took me a while to realize that this album is one of my favorites (from Muse and also in my whole collection, which ranges from Ray Charles and Elton John to the John Spencer Blues Explosion and Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and over to Moby, Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, and Sister Machine Gun).<br /><br />\\"Black Holes\\" tackles somewhat seep subject-matter with sweeping and dramatic guitar and synth combinations (cf. \\"Map of the Problematique\\"), acoustics (\\"Soldier's Poem\\", \\"Hoodoo\\"), Spanish-flavored guitar-and-horn (\\"City of Delusion\\") and good-old syncopated prog-rockin' guitar (\\"Exo-Politics\\").<br /><br />The only blemish on this album is its introductory track: \\"Take a Bow\\". It's clearly aimed at US President George W. Bush which wouldn't be a problem in general, but the song seems more like it is simply telling the world how terrible he (Bush) was, and does not offer any actual critique. The message is clear but unnecessary. The music is background-noise. This song could have been left-out and it would not have impacted the album negatively at all.<br /><br />The song \\"Invincible\\" includes a guitar solo that makes my heart leap every time I hear it. I use an intro clip of \\"Map of the Problematique\\" as the ring-tone on my phone when my brother-in-law calls (it's only fitting: he introduced me to Muse in the first place). I sing \\"Hoodoo\\" to my kids as lullabies to sing them to sleep.<br /><br />There is an unofficial music video on YouTube of \\"City of Delusion\\" that takes scenes from the Bruce Willis film \\"Surrogates\\" backed by the song. It's amazing. If you like it, you will definitely want to hear thisentire album.<br /><br />Hearing \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" still makes me feel like I could jump over a house. ;)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Be careful! This game is very addictive. The birds have a lot more abilities so it is much less frustrating that previous Birds games. It does get progressively harder, so it isn't boring, and we do love the sound effects.
B008G12ERC|1.0|Religious wars can be started amongst Muse fans over which album is best (Origin, of course) and which is worst (this one), etc. Muse is and will always be one of my favorite bands of all time: they don't owe me anything at this point.<br /><br />This album is horrible, but fans should still buy it.<br /><br />(Non-Muse-fans should go buy Origin of Symmetry and Absolution, then buy the others (including this one) once they've discovered how great this band is.)<br /><br />Why should fans still buy it if it sucks? So they'll make another one, which will (by definition) have to be better than this.<br /><br />I am a huge electronic music fan (Industrial, House, Ambient, Club, Drum-and-bass, etc.). I even like the B-side &#34;Popcorn&#34; (from &#34;Resistance&#34;). This is not an &#34;electronic&#34; album. &#34;Unsustainable&#34; is dub-step at most and it's the only one on the album.<br /><br />I am hugely disappointed that Muse chose to include the awful &#34;Survival&#34; - the song written for the 2012 Olympic Games - this album. It was so phoned-in it wasn't even funny. I can't tell which was worse: &#34;Survival&#34; or &#34;Neutron-Star Collision&#34; (from Twilight soundtrack).<br /><br />Good points: some tracks are halfway decent, or at least interesting. They are &#34;Supremacy&#34; (hard intro and other parts, but doesn't seem to be one single cohesive song IMO), &#34;Panic Station&#34; (Muse's take on funk), and Animals (guitar work).<br /><br />Toss-ups: &#34;Madness&#34;. This should have been one of Matt Bellamy's solo projects -- just like &#34;Exogenesis&#34; should have been from &#34;The Resistance&#34;. I thought it was crap the first time I heard in in advance of the album's release, but it's grown on me somewhat and I find myself humming it occasionally. Then I remember that it's not very good and I hunt for something else to get stuck in my head. &#34;Big Freeze&#34; sounds very U2-esque (in a good way).<br /><br />Bad stuff: &#34;Save Me&#34; and &#34;Liquid State&#34; (With apologies to Christopher Wolstenholme).<br /><br />The rest of the songs are completely forgettable.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My boys love this game and I love the challenge it gives them. Cause and effect/basic physics/problem solving/logic. I prefer that they play this game to most others and they do too.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|To me, this is Muse's seminal work. This album is one of the greatest progressive rock albums I've ever heard. If \\"Rush\\" is the gold-standard for progressive rock, Muse is a harder-rock answer with somewhat deeper, more subversive subject matter.<br /><br />Highlights (that you may not have heard on the radio): \\"Hyper Music\\" is one of my favorite Muse songs: it's got a (pleasantly) disorienting, dissonant guitar riff, great chord progressions, melodic vocals, and a bit of string-scratching thrown in for fun. \\"Darkshines\\" oscillates between a quiet, acoustic-like feel and arena rock. \\"Citizen Erased\\" again juxtaposes heavy guitar and bass against quiet, solitary music and vocals that cross the border into lamentations.<br /><br />There is a single \\"low-light\\" to this album in my mind, which is the cover of \\"Feeling Good\\". The recording itself is just fine: not exactly Muse's best work, but for an 11-song album, having one of the songs be a cover is somewhat off-putting.<br /><br />This album is definitely worth having in any rock-lovers collection.
0525953728|3.0|Too much padding on peripheral issues. Interesting coverage of a well covered topic with a good level of inside information. Thank you
B0001LJC2K|5.0|If you love Muse, you will absolutely love this album. If you haven't heard of Muse but you like Progressive Rock, you will very much like this album. There is amazing depth in this album given this small band (3 members plus backups). Front man Matt Bellamy includes plenty of piano on this album and the guitar keeps on coming. Drummer Dom Howard continues his odd style which - for a former drummer - I really appreciate.<br /><br />Pearls that you might not have heard on the radio (e.g. \\"Time IS Running Out\\", \\"Hysteria\\") include \\"Falling Away With You\\", \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\". A highly notable B-side (obviously not on this album) is \\"Fury\\" which is on the B-side of the \\"Sing for Absolution\\" single). Specifically, \\"Fury\\" is a B-side song that is so extraordinarily good it is better than entire albums of other artists.<br /><br />The rest of the album is very strong and holds-up well even after nearly 10 years.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is an amazing book for anyone that wants to know what true love is. Everyone even guys should read this book. I love it.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|At its release, this was my least-favorite Muse album (it's hard to beat \\"Origins\\" and \\"Absolution\\") for a few reasons. It remains so after several years in retrospect. There are some good points and bad points.<br /><br />To me, this album could be a musical interpretation/rock opera of Orwell's 1984 (or possible Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\"). The lyrics are intentionally subversive and suspicious (with the exception of \\"I Belong to You\\" which is a truly delightful ode which includes a clarinet solo and an entire movement sung in French... I suppose that represents Orwell's interludes with Julia), the music has a familiar dissonance I have come to expect (and crave) from Muse, and, for this album, is very intentionally march-like.<br /><br />The good: \\"MK Ultra\\" is fantastic: almost good enough to recommend the album simply based on its inclusion. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" sounds like a faithful Queen cover complete with 3-part harmony, piano, and guitar effects worthy of Brian May. \\"Uprising\\" is a catchy (not in a bad way) call-to-arms. \\"Unnatural Selection\\" is squarely in Muse's wheelhouse though without Bellamy's otherwise ubiquitous falsetto.<br /><br />The not-so-good: \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is an attempt at a mostly-electronic-sounding song that falls short of the mark. Honestly, I like the tune and the lyrics... just not the execution. Had it been 100% \\"organic\\", I think I would appreciate it more. The track \\"Guiding Light\\" is an overly-dramatic song with a guitar solo that brings me back to the cock-rock of the 1980s (where it should have stayed).<br /><br />The final 3 tracks - collectively \\"Exogenesis\\" - could have been developed into an entirely separate album, which I would have enjoyed. Their presence on this album seems incongruous and detracts from one that could have been more fully-developed without them.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for work and home.  Easy to organize and find notes.  Always updating and getting better. Great toll for the mobile User that syncs with all devices.
B00284BNKC|5.0|I am only 26:40 into this and I am dumbfounded.  Wow.  This is a movie that is required if you are in a desperate situation.  Because believe me if you are in a desperate situation, WATCH THIS MOVIE, and you will forget about your current situation.  And the Blu-Ray is 7.1 natively, so it sounds shocking in the man/woman cave with a native 7.1 surround system like I am following right now.  I guarantee you I will have a nightmare tonight.  This is a movie, not for the kids, but any adult should own or at least fathom.  I am a better parent now because of this movie.<br /><br />tool1970
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Loved it, it was everything I thought it would be and more. would recommend to anyone who likes Kelly Clarkson
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game. I've never had any problems running or opening it. I would like to mention that before almost every game there's an ad that you have to close before playing. I don't usually mind this because it's a free game and they have to make their money somehow, but it's frustrating when there's a movie ad with inappropriate content in it that you have to watch a certain amount of before it will let you play. My son plays this game and I don't think that's a very family friendly feature. It isn't all the time, though so it's usually fine.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|Bought this cd for 2 songs I love. Figure I would enjoy others of theirs. I was surprised to find I really didn't care for any of the rest of the album. I was quite disappointed.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|great animation, voice acting, and story. im watching part 1 and 2 right now, and this movie deserves a review. for $14 (the price right now), its more then a steal. i would pay that for the superman v. batman fight alone. joker running around GTA style? again. each scene in itself if amazing. put them all 2gether, plus with part 1, and you have the best batman movie on film. live action or not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't give it enough stars!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely wonderful! I'm already chomping at the bit for season four. I'll never make it untill January.....

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag because I only had 2 lenses for my DSLR and did't really need a large gear bag. Great little bag for those without much equipment. I end up hiking a lot of places and jumping a few fences from time to time, it holds up through a lot and I'm never concerned about my gear. Great size to take on a plane too.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is really epic with the characters and the fights. I would recommend this game to those who likes waves of enemy's coming at them. awesome .......

B000089RV6|4.0|How do you review a CD?  It was not scratched when I got it, that is good.  The music recorded on the CD was good too.  I bought this CD because AC/DC was not selling their music on iTunes.  A few weeks after I bought this, they released their music on iTunes.  WTF!?
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to trying more fantasy books after falling in love with the game of thrones series. This one was recommended on what should I read next site.<br />Reviews said it takes a while to get started so I tried really hard but I just didnt connect with any of the characters. I found the references to mages, wizards, and other forms of fantasy characters to be just too much for me. I liked that little bit of fantasy thrown into the game of thrones but this was just to bizarre for my taste. I am sure a true fantasy lover might think differently but just not my style.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|the best TV SIFI ever I am a Star Trek fan and have been most of my life and will always be.

B009KHCT94|3.0|I saw a preview for Iron Sky on another DVD... Osombie (Osama Bin Laden returns as a zombie). They had me at &#34;moon nazis&#34;.  The premise and content of the movie is no secret; there's no way you can complain that it could have been written better or in a more believable way- because again, we're talking about moon nazis. There are some pretty hilarious political jokes thrown in here that made me giggle, and I saw a few instances of laziness or over-simplification on the writers' part that also made me laugh.<br />This movie is terrible in the most enjoyable way possible.

B009X2CVXA|5.0|Second Kate Morton book, and another good one.  Loved the history and description of a another look at a  a 'Downton Abby' life of the the early 1990's.  Also the thoughts and memories of a woman in her final months of life.  Well written.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Wow - interesting story - I must admit I didn't expect the ending and there were a few things in the book that got me thinking about a lot of other issues in and around my life.  Don't think I will go to the movie though - I just want to remember this story in my own mind.  Great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is app fun and amazing I especially love the diamonds and the airline the entire game is awesome. Anyonenyone can play
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Pretty good read - didn't have to think about this story much - it was pretty predicable - however, a good light read for the long summer afternoons in the hammock.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I like a big of small unit action and big tactical action.  Threat Vector has it all.  As good as Red Storm Rising.  In my opinion, it was the best Clancy novel I've read in years.
1433502410|5.0|I was very excited to receive this study Bible. I started using it as soon as I got it. It has maps, great descriptions and commentaries, and a great concordance. I would recommend this study Bible to any student of the holy Scriptures.
0525478817|5.0|Where do I even begin with this book? I was really excited, but at the same time a bit nervous, to begin reading this book. I was not prepared for an emotional roller coaster such as this one. Young love determined to blossom despite the nasty disease that should stop it.<br /><br />Spoilers Ahead!!<br /><br />Let's start with Isaac because I honestly loved his character despite how \\"minor\\" he was. His whole being was determined to find true love despite the cards he was dealt in life; one could say he was blinded by the desire to have it (no pun intended). For a second he even thought he had until it was ripped from him like his remaining eye. He was more devastated over the loss of a girl more so than his own eye which allowed him to see the beauty of the world, but then again, his world was collapsing like any other teenage boy's by losing who they thought was the love of their life so at that point, he was a normal boy without cancer.<br /><br />Let's move on to Hazel. At first, I didn't care much for her. I really have no reason why I didn't like her other than my own fear of bonding to this character and expecting her to die in the end and rip me to shreds like any other time a character dies that I like. By the middle though, I couldn't help but love and sympathize for Hazel. I really got upset over Peter's treatment towards her even though he had lost a daughter that she reminded him of so much, it still didn't excuse his behavior. Hazel was very mature for her age and I hate that the cancer did that to her because it also made her apathetic towards life and I really wanted her to be happy especially after meeting Augustus but what did I expect reading a book about teenagers with cancer?<br /><br />So that brings me to Augustus \\"Gus\\" Waters. The knight in shining armor in my opinion. A character you couldn't help but adore and love especially when he gave up his Wish to fly his non-girlfriend, and later girlfriend, to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author. The boy that fought so hard to get her to fall in love with him while in remission to just have it all ripped from him by finding out that once again, he had to battle for life that he was destined to lose. Which he did lose and which broke me to pieces.<br /><br />I never once expected it would be Augustus who died in the end, I always thought it was Hazel but John Green has a way of turning the tables on you and making me assume one thing and throws something else your way. But at the same time, I wouldn't have it any other way. I didn't want to read a book that was so... cliché. I wanted to read something a bit different and would surprise me and this definitely did. All in all, this is one of my favorite books now, I recommend it to everyone, and I have been touched in an indescribable way and it will never leave me.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It took me quite a while to read this book. Mostly because I'd stop at one part, get a little (Shocking!) bored, and then continue on with the story, excited to read the next part.<br /><br />Never read a book that way before.<br /><br />My favorite character was Isabelle. What a badass girly girl she is. I loved everything about her. I found myself cheering her on in the fights against the demons.<br /><br />Romanceeeee is in the air-for Clary Frayyyy!<br /><br />Yep, it's a love triangle. This review won't contain any spoilers, so, just know there's a love triangle. I enjoyed the triangle, and I look forward to it in the rest of the series.<br />Probably highlighted the most quotes in here than any other book I own on my ever so useful kindle.<br />~~~~~FOR EXAMPLE~~~~~<br />\\"Shadow Hunters, looking better in black than the widows of our enemies since 1234.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, I shared that one to my friends.<br /><br />Thinking on buying this book? Do it. It's a good book.<br />Contains some..mild language. I was surprised, truthfully. But it's just a little mild. Have a swear here every, I don't know, 4 chapters-Guessing here.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the book! :3

B0099Y2YL6|4.0|\\"Downton Abbey\\" is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I am giving this season four stars because I am super critical. I feel like this season, while I still enjoyed it enormously and it is far better than pretty much anything else on television, was super predictable and contrived. I am not going to post any spoilers, because the emotional impact of this season packs quite a punch and everyone deserves to enjoy that in full without being spoilers. My main issues are that, for example, the final event that happens at the very end of the bonus/Christmas episode is something that both my husband and I predicted right down to the letter...and we predicted it during the second episode. That's how much obvious foreshadowing I think there is in the various plots this year, which is a bummer. Sometimes the storylines are so obvious, the dialogue so contrived, that it just takes away from my enjoyment of the show as a whole.<br /><br />Another big disappointment--HUGE--is Shirley MacLaine's character. When I found out she would be joining the show, I was thrilled. ALl I pictures was Shirley and Maggie Smith trading zingers back and forth with a vengeance. Sadly, Shirley's role this season is pretty brief, and her character is much more watered-down than I ever imagined. I am stunned that her talents were not put to better use, and that more effort wasn't put into giving her a more dynamic character. It wasn't a bad character or a bad performance, but it wasn't at all up to par with what I was expecting. I think there was a huge missed opportunity here.<br /><br />That is NOT to say that this is a bad season at all. It's not. It's fabulous and I enjoyed every second of it (well, except the horribly depressing parts, and I am warning you all, there are plenty of those). There are some great storylines, many surprises, and so much emotion. In terms of each character's individual stories, I think Season 3 has been the best season by far, at least as far as individual character development goes. Viewers will be emotionally rocked to the core (and totally depressed) more than once this season, and I have absolutely no idea where next season is going. But, as always, I can't wait to find out.<br /><br />As for the boxed set itself, it's fabulous. Great design, helpful chapter titles, and great special features packed into three discs. You won't be disappointed.acter development goes.

B004LWZW2E|4.0|It has been a long time since a horror movie actually creeped me out.  I am glad they focused on making the movie scary instead of just being gory.  It has some funny parts as well.

B001GCUNW6|3.0|Bought this Blu-ray package because it had the digital copy. I was hoping to use this digital copy so that my son could watch it on his tablet, but the code expired years ago. Really bummed about that because that was the reason why I bought it. Otherwise, the blu-ray itself and dvd worked fine on our console and computer.
B001JI72AI|5.0|I am not sure how I missed this movie when is first came out.  I was up late one night, looking ofr something to watch and decided to give it a try -- a great adventure.  I loved it.

I would recommend this book to anyone<br />who is already vegan, vegetarian, and anyone interested in improving<br />their health, energy and happiness!

B008CPQ8F6|5.0|The contents of this film is about a man who has completely turned his criminal life around, for a life that serves God in such horrendous conditions.  Sam Childers has such passion for saving these beautiful children.  Children who have been violated in some of the worst ways imaginable.  It's not a typical Hollywood movie thats full of action.  This movie is real and it's raw, and it's about redemption.  Sam and Lynne Childers have sacrificed everything for this cause, including placing their lives in danger.  The Bible says, the greatest love of all is to lay your life down for another, which is what Sam Childers is doing.  I pray that God keep each and every person involved in this cause safe ,from Joseph Kony and the LRA, from the savagery and destruction they create in their reign of terror.  As for the acting, Gerard Butler WAS Sam Childers in this film.  He played his part to perfection.  Michelle Monoghan and Michael Shannon were superb, as well.  I would highly recommend this movie, but to mature audiences only.

0307596885|5.0|This was such an enjoyable short story collection that I read one story every day because each story was so beautiful I felt like I needed the time to think about it and enjoy it before reading the next. This is the first of Alice Munro that I've read and now I want to read everything she's written. This collection was moving and profound and surprising. Her prose is deceptively simple and it's beautiful. It seemed to me that Munro's stories perfectly capture the moments when our lives change course. Despite the fact that some of these stories are quite sad, it wasn't depressing. I'm more of a reader of novels than short stories, so I'd recommend this to anyone, because it made me realize how great short stories can be and I know I'll read more from now on.
0312330537|5.0|First impression was that it was a large book, nearly 1000 pages, but the story unfolds so seamlessly, the characters developed so intensely that by the end I was wanting more.  It truly is one of my favorite books, EVER.  Heart breaking, funny, romantic, human and inspiring.  Some of his characters are so vivid you will swear they are real.  GREAT BOOK.
0375850864|5.0|As an adult reader, I was interested in this book because I loved Madeline L'Engle's book a Wrinkle in Time when I was young.  When You Reach Me is a wonderful tribute to that childhood classic, but it also stands on its own merits.  There's a little mystery and science fiction element which keeps the plot moving towards an interesting twist at the end.  I read the book in an evening as I couldn't put it down.  But it's more than just the plot which makes this book so enjoyable.  There are some very true-to-life moments as the main character, and her family and friends, experience the small dramas of sixth grade friendships and life in general.  Miranda's growing awareness of other people's feelings and lives also drives the plot as she learns how to navigate the changing dynamics amoung friends in the sixth grade and learns how to be a better friend herself.  I'd recommend this book to adult readers who loved a Wrinkle in Time or just enjoy a well-written break from the sometimes harsh realities of adult life and literature.  I'd also highly recommend for young readers who will enjoy the plot, but might also benefit from the very positive message this book sends about how our actions affect the lives of others and how important kindness and understanding are in making and keeping friends.  This message is conveyed so cleverly and with humor that it avoids cliches or cheesiness, but is instead quite insightful.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|At first I really didn't think I would like this game, but as soon as I started playing I loved it. It is actually very relaxing and fun.
0425264386|1.0|After one ridiculous, impossible scenario after another, the author finishes by blowing up a truck driving down a freeway of with \\"a ton\\" of dynamite by shooting the truck from a helicopter with a Barrett.  Got that so far?  This resulted in:<br /><br />\\"The terrible energy of the explosion had blasted outward and met absolutely nothing at all in it path.  Nothing soft, nothing vulnerable.  It had blasted outward and then weakened and slowed and died to a puff of breeze miles away and it had hurt nothing.  Nothing at all.\\"<br /><br />Didn't mess with the highway at all.  Why?  Because it wasn't soft and vulnerable?<br /><br />Did he remember the \\"a ton\\" of dynamite part before he wrote these lines?  I would prefer to be shot by the Barrett than endure this writing again.<br /><br />I did the terrible act of any book lover and threw this in the garbage can to prevent anyone else from having to endure this \\"story.\\"
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I was so enthralled by this book that I literally could not put it down! It is all kinds of interesting wrapped in a neat package.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A real page turner full of plot twists and turns. Cleverly written. I read it in two days, then immediately re-read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it's one of a kind get it right now and then you will love it also is AWESOME APP
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will admit I was a little cautious when I picked up this book. I had just finished reading one when Amazon recommended this one. A guy I had never heard of before, but Amazon had been correct with previous recommendations. I was about to get on a plane and needed something to read for the flight. I am so glad I did.  Howey is now easily my favorite author. I would highly recommend this book to any Sci-Fi fan, or really any fan of good fiction.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|One of the best batman's ever!  Kept me engaged the whole time.  It was fun and suspenseful.  Will watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game rocks if you're a fan of horses then this is the game for u this is just like having a real horse. You can feed it, groom it, and you can constrain with it and take it to competitions to win coins trust me you NEEEEED!!!! To get this game trust me : )
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read these straight through.  I liked the descriptions that kept the story moving along while painting a picture of the situation.  Struggles that end in some sweet victories and some bitter losses are balanced enough to keep hope alive while keeping it from becoming a fairy tale when the good guy wins every time.  I'm happy to have this in my collection.  Can't wait for more from this author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not since The stand has Mr King taken me on such an incredible ride. This is truly a epic piece of storytelling.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I read this book 50 years ago and enjoyed it.  I actually enjoyed it more this time around.  Very good book.<br />John
B0063GORYU|5.0|helps me relax. I enjoy it at the end of my day. challenging trying to beat my time with each play
B006M6NV0M|5.0|I have to say, I really loved the theater release. It moves from very physical action scene to very physical action scene with personality disclosing moments between characters.<br /><br />This director's cut reveals a much deeper and heart driven story. It is a much more satisfying experience for the watcher. The opening intro by Stallone and the special features are all amazing to watch. The are insight into what inspired this movie. Stallone reveals alto in these. They are a great addition.<br /><br />I can't more highly recommend The Expendables: Extended Director's Cut. (It is important to note this is not a movie for younger children.)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|LG Optimus G, works as advertised. Can be a time filler that turns out to be hard to put down. The game play is easy and addictive.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|played a long time, no way to use all the 17K coins, so it got very boring, quit playing  a
B001XVD2Z0|3.0|Although this movie still has good production value, special effects, stunts, etc. the story is not at all plausible to me. It seems that the whole premise of the film is to contrive some story explaining why the world we live in may not be as real as we think. It also seems that the main characters all seek the advice of a fortune teller to inspire their decisions.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|boring, same words over and over and over and over and over and over...................and over and over and over and ov
B001EOQWEO|5.0|It was easy to fall in love with this movie, it's simple and thought provoking. Lovable by the young and old.<br />My Grandson (4) loves all robots I think Wall-E started it all.<br />I'm amazed that a movie with so little words can affect someone so profoundly, we did watch it daily, now we are down to weekly.<br />It definitely makes you wonder if we are headed that way, the garbage, letting robots take over our lives.<br />I highly recommend this movie for everyone!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is so interesting.  It takes<br />you through the lives of some<br />interesting characters.  I got so<br />attached I was sad when it ended!<br />Nice long enjoyable book!
B00005JM02|5.0|I have always loved Disney/Pixar movies, they are very engaging and colorful. If you look close enough you can also find educational tributes as well. In this it would be listening to your parents but also for parents not to smother the enjoyment of life from the child or they will rebel.<br />A great movie for families.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|One of my favorite shows.  Thanks for the addition to my group.  I love all the actors and the stories.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|This is a heart warming and yet heart wrentching movie. I cried through the last 25 min. It is a great story about true loyalty, but very sad towards the end. Caution, there are a few scenes of social drinking, and it tends to lead to the idea that everyone goes to heaven, or at least to an eternal existence as wandering spirits. It also shows how &#34;people like to take credit for things they had nothing to do with&#34; once someone is gone from this life.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I am working on the whole collections and love watching it over and over and over.  Thank you for this show
0451232852|3.0|There was good plot development and an easy to set of characters. However, Follett overstates every Progressive Era myth. All the Russian aristocrats are utterly corrupt and cruel, the White Army is incompetent, and labor union leaders are always the perfectly good guys. Alas, if history really played out that way!<br /><br />I can attest, having grown up there, that his breakdown of neighborhoods in Buffalo is very accurate. Too bad his characters political and social features are overly exaggerated. It hinders enjoying the plot. Do you really want to cheer on Lenin, Trotsky, and Zenoviev as they march the Soviet Union into an era of Gulags, mass famines, and military aggression, including the Hitler-Stalin pact and thus another world war? Woodrow Wilson is similarly idolized and all other American political figures vilified, except Follett notes Wilson's racism in passing at the end of the first volume.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Thanks for the 2nd one in my collection.  I love the show and it will be a great addition to my group.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I am totally addicted to this series, and cannot wait for Season 3 to begin in the spring.  I know it is something I could watch over and over again.  I will certainly be ordering Season 3
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I keep reading. The shortstories are great, it is a series of letters and they are great.Recommend you try it
B009OWGMYI|5.0|This album is a great collection of songs from the years of great music from HIM! While I do have these songs already from the original album, there are a few songs that are mixed differently than the original versions.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Required viewing for cultural literacy, IMO, James Whale's film is not true to Shelley's masterpiece, but it is a seminal film that spawned multitudes of works.  Frankenstein has become its own genre, and even those who have never seen the film or read the book *know* Frankenstein, if superficially.  Rather than mock the movie, I kindly suggest viewers focus upon the mastery of Boris Karloff, who plays the creature with a great deal of skill. He had no actual lines and yet he uses his body language and gestures to convey his emotions.  The set, too, is the archetype for the 'mad scientist' laboratory.  In fact, the producers of Young Frankenstein tracked down many of the props of the original movie to use in their classic comedy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  First book I've read in a long time that I could not stop reading or thinking about.  The characters are awesome and get inside your head.  Will try another Gillian Flynn novel soon.
0061900656|4.0|This is a great book to welcome a new baby to a little brother.  Your family will enjoy reading this one over and over.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because this book deserves it!  Safe Haven tackled the very important subject of abuse towards women in a very sensitive way,  Well done Nicholas Sparks!  I am looking forward to the movie in February!  I hope they do it justice!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series.  Maggie Smith is outstanding. Outside scenes were breathtaking.  Looking forward to season 3 and to see where the story goes.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|If you are a person that needs a little extra noise in the background to fall asleep this is the app for you. There are plenty of options to choose from. A few sound looped but most are wonderful. Enjoy
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I got this DVD in time for a visit from my grandkids.  We all enjoyed it and the message of taking care of the earth.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I loved everything minute of it as I went to Vegas and watch her live it was nice being able to relive some of it....
B0050DIWFC|4.0|What an ending!  It's a very suspenseful book right up to the last page. Never would have guessed that ending!  A worthy read.
0547884591|5.0|Great book for various reasons. If you want to learn to cook its great. If you want to motivate and need some tools to help accomplish goals even better.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good pace, these books always give great background and details. I believe if i were ever to write a book I could use Tom Clancy books as reference books. His detail is excellent.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|it's very addictive plus the fact that I have high scores on it makes even better, yes i have recommended it to friends
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I have to say I was a little worried when I first heard &#34;Closer,&#34; but this gets better with every listen. A big departure from their earlier songs.
B005HSL626|3.0|not as good as the one you have to pay, because it restricts you alot.  it's best to get the other one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He did it again another tail that makes a person examine their lives a little more closely. Imagining how many times old souls have guided us without our knowledge makes the hopes of seeing lost loved ones again more real
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I love sci fi and i'm also a huge fan of Halo, so it's a win win situation in my book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun it is so addicting cant stop playing it. I dream a bout playing it that how good it is.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once again I love sci fi, I really love reading the trilogy I liked the Hunger Games movie, and I'm also looking forward to the second movie as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fun book to read.  Great story line. Full of excitement, eroticism, romance, love, characters, and suspense. I absolutely loved it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my daughter and i luv spending  time collecting coins and completing quests. graphics are great especially on my kindle fire.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Love it, can't say enough good things.  His voice, the way he sounds with Cheryl and others.  Just love the Kid.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Wow. Different from what I normally read (mystery, thrillers, homocide detectives, etc.) but what a gripping story. So endearing and worth the read. I would assume this would be great for anyone dealing with a loved one with Alzheimers or Dementia. Although, you don't need to be interested in that subject to like the book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A gripping history of WW2 and the rise of communism under Staline. As a history buff,I was mesmerised. If you love history, I highly recommend it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|the only thing that keeps this app from being perfect is the fact that some of this sounds are looped.
0765325950|5.0|While you don't really read a 14-book series just for the ending, if it had ended poorly, it would have been extremely disappointing.  All of the principal plot lines are reasonably tied off reasonably well and I enjoyed the pace of it.  I'm a little sad to have put down The Wheel of Time for the last time, but I'm sure
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If  you are a fan of glee and such you'll love this CD. Fast shipping I love the CD I've been listening to it none stop sense I got it :-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a horse lover's game for the whole family.  Each member can have their own horse to care for and compete with.  You can also buy your own tack and name your horse.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very inventive story. I found I took time to imagine the world the author created. Like an adult Harry Potter.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far the game is interesting. Waiting for it to get a bit more fun. Hopefully it comes quickly and with more things to do without narrorating
1591791707|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this.  Marshall has many good and easy to use techniques to improve communication both with others and yourself.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|This disc is an excellent choice for people who like a variety of world, ethnic music.  Sitar music with a Spanish influence provides good pleasant listening--and a nice change for those of us who like classical Spanish guitar music.
