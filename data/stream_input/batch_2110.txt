B000J3OTSM|3.0|Changing Tatum has a whole new appeal lately for sure. This movie isn't as great as others of its time . Similar in nature to Save The Last Dance but it is still worth watching such fantastic dance moves.

B008ASGP3U|5.0|Seemed more like earlier Rebus novels...<br />was quick read for me...<br />But I can't understand why if Rebus is SO GOOD at sniffing out clues and finding culprits he never gets any respect...<br />surely the police dept realizes that even if he doesn't fit the stereotype of what a good policeman should be--he is even better...<br />this is theme among other detective literature that never seems to get old...<br />Michael Connelly's detective Harry Bosch falls into the same niche...
B007QNRMUU|4.0|Love Jason Mraz. And I  Love  Love love the song &#34;I won't give up&#34;.  What a Beautiful voice that man has.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Finally got time to read Dr. Cordain's book and implement it's guidelines. I am so far very impressed with the results. I am naturally a skeptic and am required to be as a healthcare practitioner, but after years of going by the \\"governments guidelines\\" and  calorie restriction, or starvation, diet unsuccessfully I knew there had to be something wrong. I had ballooned from 195 and 8% bf in undergrad to 240 lb and 23+% bf at the worst. 4 weeks into following paleo and I have dropped from 227lb to 211lb and 38in pants to 36 in, but even those are getting loose.  The biggest health benefit has been the resolution of a lifetime of GERD less than 3 days into starting. I am now off Prilosec and Zantac completely and sleep so much better. That is the biggest reason I plan to adhere to paleo. Dr. Cordain's explanation of paleo is great for both those with a science background and those without. He is exceptional at both presenting the evidence and interpreting it for easier mental digestion. My next goal is 200lb, and my reward will be a blood test to measure my internal progress. I can't wait to see where this will take me!
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Almost as good as the first. It was delightful after watching the movie over a dozen times, to find out what happens next. Although predictable, it was still a fun, light read.

0446580848|1.0|I managed to get one third of the way through the book by skimming over all the prattle and then decided to check the reviews to discover if it gets miraculously better. NOT seems to be the shouted answer. This book is just terrible... I think others have already mentioned that so I won't go on... but save your time and quit now. John is more disgusting than ever, if I were there I would help the Panther. That is the end of my relationship with Nelson DeMille. In case you are wondering, I am not bothering to finish the rest of it. I think I'll just go wash my hair and do my nails...
1932073221|4.0|Subtly different from other Law of Attraction money books--but then, the more you become atuned to subtlety, the less subtle it becomes!  I found this book to be hugely valuable, as it triggered some honest personal exploration of my belief systems.  Everything we experience in reality is a product of beliefs and I *believe* there is no built-in agreed-upon meaning to things otherwise.  So, \\"change your beliefs, change your life\\" it is.<br /><br />There are great exercises at the end of each chapter.  The most prevalent is some version of \\"magnetizing to you,\\" in a meditative state, people and stuff to help you achieve your desires.  In Abraham-Hicks jargon, you'd call them \\"cooperative components.\\"  Roman and Packer (and their channeled counterparts) gently show you how it's possible to have what you want without so much outward striving.  Or, at least how to do the magnetizing first so that the ensuing effort will be far more efficacious!  Their perspective dovetails nicely with the teachings of Bashar (another channeled entity, via Darryl Anka), whose wisdom I've grown rather fond of lately.  If you're into this sort of woo-woo stuff, I highly recommend checking him out--especially his stuff around Changing Core Beliefs.<br /><br />Overall, CM (as my boyfriend and I fondly refer to it) is a very inspiring and potentially life-changing read.  I give it 4 rather than 5 stars only because I found the writing to be awkward at times.  But I suppose discarnates do the best they can with the whole human language thing...  : )
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Very good show. Enjoy the acting, costumes, and locations. The story line is continuously changing and keep the viewer interested. Thanks for your consideration.
B004132HZS|5.0|Such a great take on iconic stories and characters. Very clever in the way the stories are adapted to the modern era. Perfect casting decisions. I have the feeling that if Doyle were writing his stories for the first time right now, this is how they would turn out.

B007IK44CK|5.0|Awesome movie!! Hope the next one is better or at least same to this one. Hawkeye is a good addition to the team.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is definitely a great game, but the Imangi folks should know that I ran up a ridiculous score (Username: Famousdave2) somehow of 1,635,692,000. This shows up on amazon GameCircle. This score is not legitimate and should be deleted. Also, the distance score of 65,427,528 is not valid either. Thanks. My Stats in the game are correct.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|My friend and I chose to watch this movie thinking it would be really dumb and only worth watching to laugh at, however, this movie is deceptively enduring and all around very funny in its dead-pan satire at the expense of the contemporary teen horror flick.  It is worth the $4 rental price.  As of this review, it's also streaming on Netflix if that's your cup of tea.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Story had holes in it.  It was just ok. Wouldn't pay much to see it. I like time traavel movies, but this one just wasn't that good.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Only complaint I have, is that video freezes a LOT! Or it takes a long time to come on. More often than not it will freeze 3-4 times during the show/extremely frustrating! Otherwise, the show is awesome if you like old fashion, good acting well made series !!! PLEASE FIX freezing problem! Thank you, Julia
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Easy to use, just plug and start talking. I love the long cord. I can walk around my 20 x 20 sq. ft studio with this lavalier mic still attached to me (although I don't recommend you do!) I will recommend this for those starting out recording videos or podcast. It seems to filter some of the background noise,too! For the price, it's well worth it! I'll buy it again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I lie this game it is so fun recommend to all. my faverate game ever.  i can play this all day long.
B005FITIIC|5.0|*This review contains spoilers*<br /><br />It's quite an achievement to make a movie about a boring subject and keep the viewer engaged throughout, but Margin Call does just that. It's a financial drama, depicting events leading up to the last stock market crash in 2008.<br /><br />The movie begins with a scene showing Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) being laid off. He's in risk management for an investment company. When he's informed of the decision, he's escorted back to his office to pick up his belongings, and then made to leave the building. His phone service is immediately terminated and he's told to forget about anything he was working on as it's no longer his problem. But Dale hands a USB drive to a colleague before he leaves, advising him to be careful.<br /><br />The colleague is Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), who takes a look at Dale's research when everyone else has left the office. His findings set in motion a series of events taking place over 24 hours, during which we are shown how a financial crisis might be handled.<br /><br />Many scenes involve people looking at computer screens and talking about the worrying implications, but the excellent screenplay makes us anticipate what is coming next. There is a little technical jargon, but it doesn't matter if you don't understand anything about Mortgage Backed Securities. The beauty of the story is in showing the chain of command, and the way in which people respond to the unfolding events.<br /><br />We see the problem being talked about by Sullivan and a junior analyst, and they decide to tell their immediate superior, Will (Paul Bettany). He then calls in his boss, Sam (Kevin Spacey). As the night wears on, a series of meetings take place. Other department heads are called in, and ultimately the man who decides the overall strategy (Jeremy Irons). Eric Dale cannot be traced, and the decision to terminate his services causes problems to all concerned.<br /><br />My favorite scene involves Dale talking about his former career as an engineer. He reveals how much of a difference one man can make, and shows some of the traits which earned him his job in risk management.<br /><br />The movie depicts leadership, reaction to stress, and how a strategy was devised to resolve the situation with as little damage to the company as possible. Ruthless decisions were called for and made, and the story has an undeniable ring of truth at every turn. That's not surprising when you realize that director J.C. Chandor's father worked for Merrill Lynch for 30 years.<br /><br />Margin Call is a movie that's well-written, well-acted,and surprisingly gripping. It might even make you question your investment strategy. Although I loved Wall Street, I think Margin Call is my favorite story set in the world of finance.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5his former career as an engineer.

B008OIQYTG|5.0|LR is nothing if not an incredibly prolific, gifted and connected musician. He never ceases to amaze me with the music he creates, and often with many others, and his unique talent to bring the right session musicians to play with him.<br /><br />I would characterize this collection of music as eclectic excellence. It is all different, some with vocals, but all with the common theme of having rhythmic qualities of many forms of music aka jazz, Brazlian and r & b.<br /><br />It's really a modern classic.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Back when there were two classes of citizens, this book shows the hypocrisy of those who think they are better then everyone else. It demonstrates the lengths that some will go just to show they are better when it actually shows that they are less.  It is not the size of one's shadow that counts, it is the shadow that you leave on everyone's heart that matters.  This was an excellent book and an excellent movie.
B0040X46TE|5.0|I would like a single if it ever comes out, I would give everyone in my family a copy of it

1449325947|5.0|This book is both board and deep. Meaning it covers a ton of topics and goes in-depth on all of them. This book is great for the beginner, but also has a lot of advanced material.<br /><br />After a nice introduction that explains the structure of the book the author starts off Part 1 covering the basics. The book starts with the basics and leads us to advanced topics by the end of the book.<br /><br />I have listed the 5 parts of the book below with the chapters they contain to give an idea of all the topics covered.<br /><br />Part 1. CSS Basics<br />1. HTML for CSS<br />2. Creating Styles and Style Sheets<br />3. Selectors: Identifying What to Style<br />4. Saving Time with Style Inheritance<br />5. Managing Multiple Styles: The Cascade<br /><br />Part 2. Applied CSS<br />6. Formatting Text<br />7. Margins, Padding, and Borders<br />8. Adding Graphics to Web Pages<br />9. Sprucing Up Your Site's Navigation<br />10. CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations<br />11. Formatting Tables and Forms<br /><br />Part 3. CSS Page Layout<br />12. Introducing CSS Layout<br />13. Building Float-Based Layouts<br />14. Responsive Web Design<br />15. Positioning Elements on a Web Page<br /><br />Part 4. Advanced CSS<br />16. CSS for the Printed Page<br />17. Improving Your CSS Habits<br /><br />Part 5. Appendixes<br />A. CSS Property Reference<br />B. CSS Resources<br /><br />I have found CSS to be very powerful, but a lack of understanding can lead to some messy web sites. I have seen some really tragic HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementations. Reading this book and using it as a reference will help avoid that. The author does a great job of showing how things should be done the right way.<br /><br />The author did a great job putting together the code samples. Each chapter has two folders. One with the beginning of the solution, and one marked finished for the end result of applying the techniques shown in the chapter.<br /><br />The author does a great job covering responsive web design. This is something I have seen mangled up a lot. The author covers media queries, flexible grids, and fluid images. He also did a great job in this part of the book leading into responsive web design with chapters on CSS layout and float-based layouts.<br /><br />The nice flow is actually found throughout the entire book. The chapters are put together in a very logical order which is one of the characteristics that make this book a good cover to cover read.<br /><br />I also really liked the chapter on providing a print page using CSS. The is nothing more annoying than finding a great article, blog, or a product description that you want to print out that just won't print nicely. I can't tell you how many times I have recreated information on the web in word just to be able to print it. This chapter does a great job of showing you how to avoid aggravating your customers with unprintable pages.<br /><br />The author's writing style make this an easy cover to cover read, but it is also laid out in such a way that it also makes a great reference.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to be a great read and highly recommend it to all web developers and also to those Windows 8 Store App developers using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.b design.

B0038OY6DW|5.0|This is probably the best Sherlock movie i have ever seen.  The story is made exciting by the acting skills of all the main cast.  Its the perfect combination of laughs, problem solving, mystery, drama, and action.  :D Great for a rainy day!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was hard to put down, an interesting twist at the end. I see it's coming out in a movie. It'll be interesting if it stays true to the book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|What a great game! Lots of fun:) and the fact that it was free is awesome! My kids love it too!
B006885FZI|5.0|Great filmmaking as always. Souls be requirement of all high school students studying American History and anyone seeking to become a citizen.
B003PIS6GO|4.0|It would not suprise me if they ever decided to remake this into a newer version.  The story definitely takes you places as it does the main character who innocently plays video games until one day he is taken into the reality.  Being used to high visual effects its very low on the visually appealing scale but has its good points.  My dad loves this movie so I got it for him to watch.
1591845831|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  I bought 5 paper copies after reading the electronic version so I can give them to friends.

B0013WI0PQ|4.0|Poor kid goes through a lot.  I like how he makes the best of every situation and always keeps upbeat despite the people he comes to be surrounded by.  Lovely story, pretty music.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|If you are home or on the road this is for you. The weather any time and almost any were.
B008EEHRAU|3.0|I saw this film a long time ago at a friends house. It is PG-13.  Has a great story which touches a cord in anyone who has ever been uprooted and moved repeatedly.  Disliked one scene which shows two nude people through a screen.  Did not see this scene in the last version I had watched either due to poor picture quality at the time or forgetfulness.  Movie has a lot of cute laughs throughout and with the exception of this scene is pretty PG rated...
B009GED3HS|5.0|Five stars for a comedy that will make you laugh and go crazy waiting for the next episode. A must watch
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My three YR Old loves this game &middot;Its really good for him to learn how to care for a real pet so when the time comes he knows what responsibility comes with it &middot; He loves horses and this app made him super happy - Definitely worth it &middot; Good luck(:

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I reaally enjoy playing this game. I think its way better than the first one. its sooo addicting. I can play this game for hours and not get bored. I Love it!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is essentially a well-done soap opera, but it also gives a glimpse of the upstairs & downstairs worlds of the British aristocracy and their servants, as well as an appreciation of the massive social and economic change that occurred during the turn of the 20th Century.  Give it a go!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very intense through most of the book, but I didn't like the end at all.  Genus scheming on her part.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What more can I say.  Firefly was a great show, well cast, beautifully shot and a genuine pleasure to watch.  The only problem with the show is there isn't any more.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I really like this series. The characters develop in very interesting ways. The plots are  interesting. The only thing I don't like is the very fake looking bodies in the autopsy area.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son bought it with his won money, and he has been playing it since.  I think he plays it a little bit too much sometimes!
B0036UW09U|1.0|Maybe this match-up worked in the seventies, or whenever this won best picture, but I found Kriss Krisofferson and Barbara Streisand to be bland and boring.  The songs were horrendous and the storyline stilted.  The dialogue was absolutely moronic.  Maybe the film is saved in it's third act, but I wouldn't know because I stopped watching somewhere after the midpoint.
B000IYUIPK|5.0|Good acting and Great Plot.  Would recommend for anyone any age to see. What a pair of actors for thismovie.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I always liked the original Sherlock Holmes stories, and this adds some fascinating twists to them. It's a great show.
B00340ESIS|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to learn more about script writing and the movie business. Blake Snyder is funny and reverent in his writing, and shares helpful tidbits and inside secrets about the industry.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|totally spacy no kevin spacey but out there but I must say starwars birds poop all over space birds yes
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Easy to use from my laptop to my kindle Fire.  Before I found this app I had to post to fb first to get pics into my gallery on the Kindle Fire.  This is so easy to drag pics to the cloud icon and they instantly upload.  I recommend this app highly.
B001UGB1X8|1.0|SOFA KING WE TODD ID. The most disconnected plot and wasted film.  Can't beleive Tommy let this get to the theater.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife's and beheading  two of them. And for being  was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|I never watched Kelly on American Idol. And I didn't pay that much attention to her after she won the first season. But it all changed with Since U Been Gone. I became instantly obsessed with that song and with her. I became one of her biggest fans. This compilation is a celebration of her career and could not be any better. Just about every song she ever released as a single is here. The bonus DVD makes it that much better. Kelly is a wonderful singer. It is truly a treat to listen to.
B004RCUJ9E|1.0|i deleted the app once i found it very forgettable...doesn't stand the test of time like other great apps. looking for more.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my gf loves it is fun game I heard the constant updates are annoying but I heard its a lot of fun
B001UTW7QU|3.0|The acting seems real then it seems stupid. It's done well enough to another series, but you might find yourself pausing the program and getting up  to clear the cob webs out of your head..
B0063IH60K|2.0|Basic solitaire which I like but I ended up deleting this game because I got tired of the anoying ads.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|don't remember much of the app...i was very forgettable. i found better apps during my time searching the app store.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it isn't alwas very good doesn't update all the time and it is just no where near what it is like on your phone or computer personally I try not to use it on here because it stinks
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I would recommend this book to everyone. There is a life after this one and it's exciting to read about the experiences others have had.
0312370849|4.0|The story goes back and forth between first person account by the auther and third person about Sarah. While I found the end of (the author's story) rather predictable, it didn't take away from the book. Sarah's story is very moving and your heart aches for her.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have read a great deal on Lincoln and this added to that and was well done.  Take the time to read this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I felt like I was in a time machine . the date I was sent back to was a dark day in my past being chased by a large African mamel and being corned into unwanted actions very scary stuff. I mean the temple dud eholding his face on the app cover should hint the horror that it beholds
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I bought this book not realizing that the main characters were so young,  but the plot development kept me turning pages, especially after the first 1/3 of the book.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|We've all seen haunted objects before, but this is a new one:  a dibbuk box known mainly to those familiar with Judaism and Jewish folklore.  A dybbuk is a demon or dislocated spirit, and this one lives inside a wine cabinet.  Problems ensue when a young girl picks it up from a yard sale and takes it into her house, endangering herself and the rest of the family.  Nice performances from the younger actors in particular.
B005LAIH2C|2.0|\\"Too many hands in the pot spoil the soup\\". This seems to apply to this movie with so many producers that there was no control. Editing was as bad as the CGI ogre which was really poor. So was the language and the subplot about diabetes. If you never heard of Hansel and Gretel, Grimms fairey tales or production values this movie might work for you. Otherwise stay away for there are far better fairey tales out there.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|free why not take it I heard it is great though say the movies GREAT great great great ten words
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|How can you not love the first season? Its so much fun, and somehow through all the bad effects and under budgeted episodes you see real heart and become attached to these characters.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Excellent, compelling read, like classic Clancy.  Don't miss this one.  ALMOST as good as The Hunt For Red October.  Ends well.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler - Privateering<br />  Mark Knopfler is of course best known for his band the Dire Straits, but he has been busy releasing great solo albums since the 80's!<br /> &#34;Privateering&#34; is Knopfler's ode to the South which he unfolds over 2 CD's full of softer country-blues inspired rock tunes.  Complete with fiddle, cittern, uilleann pipies, accordian, harp and the guitar work of Knopfler.  His music is sincere and heart felt on the softer tracks and smoothtly blues-rock on the faster more upbeat numbers!<br /><br />  This is Knopfler's first double album and he sure covers a wide spectrum here on this set with some fantastic song writing. No question that fans of Knopfler will like this album !  The song &#34;Dream of the drowned submariner&#34; is one of the absolute killer tracks that Mark ever recorded....a bit of a Peter Green thing going on...
B0068THAGY|2.0|I wish Amazon would allow HD quality movies on PCs.  As it stands, I was simply uninterested in watching Super 8 to the finish due to the low resolution.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best I have it for all version xbox Pc and pocket edition it is so awesome buy it save your money do any thing it is so fun
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I've really enjoyed watching this as I unfortunately didn't give it the time it was due when it was first on the air.  It's nice to be watching a Sci-Fi show without the high level of &#34;Soap Opera&#34; type drama that's so common today.  A good family friendly show that although a bit rough in the first season (which Star Trek wasn't?), but gets better as it goes along.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny movie and intertaining I have seen better but it was cute.I would not watch it again I wish you had a little more time to view it
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 4 year old loves this app can't stop playing it.. it's amazing... I am even addicted to it... it's a family it's a family thing..
B0080YGZ20|5.0|I really love the melodies and she has a great voice. Its a fun album to listen to, but that's my opinion.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am enthralled; pulled back into the era; enjoying every minute of Downton Abby. The story line, characters and every actor is sheer perfection!  Bravo!!!
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|Great video and audio quality. The movie was a stretch on the imagination with the 4 good guys against 400 bad guys, but it was still fun to watch.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Love the app but it does freeze up sometimes. It's a cute game though and I play it quite often.
0765325950|1.0|WAY too much devoted to battle scenes (yes, I know it was the final battle, but still, 400+ pages. I had to really struggle to not just toss it in the trash. He completely misses a couple key meetings between specific characters I had been waiting for for years (I won't spoil it here. Sanderson already did)<br />It's too bad. He didn't do all that badly with the previous two books. Not great, but not horrible. This one was a serious let-down.<br />Could someone else please write another ending for this?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is fun and exciting. Full of adventure. Gets your heart to racing to where you feel like you're really running from this animal.
B001LOPYHI|4.0|This movie has been a favorite since my teen years - along with the novel on which it was based. It seemed so cool then and by comparison the special effects are so cheesy now, but the story is stll a good one. If you like classic sci-fi movies or storylines that show people questioning their preconceived notions, then this is a good one for you.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this so I could know the story before the movie comes out. I've always been a Sparks fan but this certainly became one of my favorites!
B000FA5STS|4.0|I really liked this book,  A good story-line, well-written, and held my attention.<br />I do think he is a good author
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This DVD is a must see for blues aficionados.  Joe B is an incredible player, and has excellent pipes as well.  Fabulous song list, outstanding guest artists, and impeccable video and sound quality make this DVD a true pleasure to own.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Best sci-fi series of all time.  Anna Torv and John Noble are both great actors as is Joshua Jackson.  Plenty of action but it doesn't overwhelm the &#34;thinking&#34; part of the plot.
B006BQNJR8|2.0|Could have been a good reboot of a series. Was just so generic and poorly done. Don't watch it. Extra words
B0015DROBO|2.0|Too verbose  Too much filler and repetition.  Could have cut the story in half and missed nothing.  Only became interesting toward the end
B009CVELHG|5.0|Stars like Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery and Lionel Barrymore makes this movies to the best Movie in the year 1931/32.<br /><br />Movie has a length of 113 min and is in Black & White. It looks good on Blu-Ray but not quite perfect. Its free of damages, scratches, dirt.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is Code-Free and contains also a german Track.<br /><br />Contains any special features: Audio-Commentary (not subtitled), Makin of \\"Checking out\\" (subtitled, approx. 13 min), Premiere Newsreel, Theater Announcement (= special Trailer), and approx. 25 min \\"Vitaphone Musical Short: Nothing Ever Happens\\" and the Trailer of the Remake from 1945: \\"Week-End at The Waldorf\\".<br /><br />OK, for younger viewer the movie could be boring but it was made in 1932. And the actors/actresses had STYLE and GLAMOUR.<br /><br />TRIVIA: And the end of the movie, the young honeymooner Mrs. Hoffman is Mary Carlisle (\\"Remote Control\\") - she's until today (February 10th 2013) the last surviving actress from that movie. And director Edmund Goulding has a cameo appearance.<br /><br />One of the \\"Bellboys\\" - Robert Lees, wrote later scripts for Series like \\"Lassie\\", \\"Flipper\\", \\"Rawhide\\" and appeared in only 3 others movies like \\"Rasputin and the Empress\\" (where all 3 Barrymores appearing the only one time in a movie together). Robert Lees wrote also the screenplays for several Abott and Costello movie and was murdered 2004 (at age 91) in his home.<br /><br />FAZIT: well done!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|About a passionate and faithful man, to his family and his countrymen. Not a chick flick, but I enjoyed it very much, even shed a few tears. There are some scenes I had to turn away from as I am squeamish when it comes to limbs and heads being lobbed off; this prevented me from watching the film through to the end on several past occasions but this time I stuck it out to the end and I'm really glad I did.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I liked Moonrise Kingdom a lot. It was a goofy and fun movie. The cinematography was really spectacular at times.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the book and can't wait to read the next new heroes of Olympus book it's my favorite series
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully produced and full of intrigue. I get to love and hate wicked Thomas and O'Brian. Maggie Smith steals it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As usual, Albom gives us a simple reflection on a troubling aspect of our nature. In our desperate desire to control everything in our lives, we are challenged to accept that we cannot control time. Excellent read.
B009CPES4I|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was much better than I expected. My wife wanted to see this and I just went along. It had a very good story line and was interesting.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I hope you make a game called subway surfers 2. My favorite character is Tasha ya!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Best movie we've seen since Skyfall. Superb acting and unpredictable plot made it well worth watching!<br />We highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the season and the amazon prime video service made watching it so convenient. Highly recommend it to anyone, but would also encourage folks to start from the beginning rather than diving into the second season to start.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down loved the way you could actually visualize the characters... Made my husband read it after me :) can't wait to see it in Thursday!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose this rating because enjoyed this book a lot! I didn't want to put it down. I finished the book in less than three days. I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys romance and even some suspense.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|It kept my interest way to the end - mmm wondering- Yes I liked this movie. Reccomend  to adult- I liked the ending of Mom just leaving  not saying a word
B00000J8EK|5.0|The first time I heard Sunshine Underground, I was HOOKED!!!!!! I listened to the album on the net and tried to order it (from a different seller than this last time).  The first seller failed.  I gave up.  However, the music stayed in my psyche.  I decided to give it another try with a different seller and this time the sale worked.<br /><br />I recommend this album to EVERYONE! Everyone needs to be exposed to as many genres as possible and THIS album is EXCEPTIONAL.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|With Q retired, M dead, and not much tech gadget expo, this is below average for a 007 movie. I think the American 007 (Mission Impossible) is getting more tech savvy than the Original British one.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was an intense read.. I could not put it down. It was so well written I felt like a part of the book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Why chose- just fun!<br />I am so hooked on Spider<br />Reccomend to Any One!  but be careful you will get hooked on Spider
B00296A4F4|5.0|Was really nice to watch them all again. No commercials!!!  We can not wait to the all the rest of the seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|By itself, the first season of Fringe seems like a typical \\"case of the week\\" sci-fi.  Almost every one of the first season episodes will tie into another episode or two and may even reveal major plot devices used later in the story arc.  This season of Fringe is more than it seems. I was going to rate it 4 stars and thinking back on the way the show is playing out, it deserves 5.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really awesome.  Similar to Temple Run, only WAY better!  If you like Temple Run, then there is no way you won't like this game!
B002Q4GIJ0|5.0|a great addition to the terminator line of movies.If you havent seen it yet,you will see some new terminators.Action packed
B004F1F32A|1.0|My adult kids know how much I love watching my boys Segal, Van Damme & Norris. My youngest (27) suggested I watch Taken as Leeson is the new Segal. Wrong! At least my fellas make now bones about the action thriller movies they make. Taken was cheezy and unimpressive.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I had went to a Redbox to rent this movie. The box didn't work and my girls were so disappointed. So we came home and tried Amazon Instant Video. The picture and sound quality was great. The girls loved the movie and watched it so many times, that I am now going to buy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It like a whole new temple run only better. It has way more fun stuff and it's like advance I can like it more!
B000SP1SH6|4.0|Bill Murray's best performance, to date, is captured in this film.  What proof do I have to offer?  He actually makes the audience believe that Andie McDowell is a decent human being worthy of admiration and talent.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Best WWII Documentary ever seen. The World at War. Archival footage, eye witness accounts by people who were actually there.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I wanted to like this album, I really did.  But every time I tried to listen to it I was disappointed by the muddiness  and lack of clarity.  Geddy  Lee sounds like he is wailing in a tunnel during a hurricane.  I can't pick out the drums,  guitar,  or bass over the maelstrom of background noise in the songs.  Their  past albums were precise and all parts  of the music could be listened to separately or as a whole,  but not this.  This band was once a well- oiled machine,  but now it desperately needs a tune- up,  which is a sadly ironic  thing to say about an album titled  Clockwork Angels.  I'll never give up on the band itself.  They have been the soundtrack of my life for over 20  years.  But every time I try  to listen to this album I end up cussing at the stereo and switching to any other album of theirs and remembering how good they used to sound.
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|Some excellent episodes in this season.  Much superior to the previous seasons and a great storyline that extended through the season.  The Xindi are an alien species intent on destroying Earth; in fact, all humanity.  Archer and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to stop the Xindi from building a planet buster weapon that they will use to destroy Earth.  (Planet destroying weapons seem all the rage these days... since the Death Star introduced them in you-know-what)  To accomplish their assignment, the crew of the Enterprise must cross the Delphic Expanse, a sector replete with spatial and time anomalies that plague the Enterprise and it appears the ship may not even reach the planetary systems of the Xindi.  To further complicate matters, it turns out that the anomalies of the Expanse are due to objects, spheres, being constructed by the Sphere Builders, another race of aliens who are not only alien to our civilization but are actually alien to this universe.  There are great Xindi characters introduced and since the Xindi are composed of four separate races, insectoid, reptilian, aquatic and humanoid, there is opportunity for some excellent special effects which are done magnificently.  And there is the Andorian, Shran, whose character is played by Jeffrey Combs, who steals the show in a couple of episodes.  This season could have been made into a very good movie by some judicious editing (especially taking out several episodes that did not further the Xindi plot).  If you enjoy good space opera and Star Trek is not anathema to you, well worth watching.  I enjoyed it.  Even the &#34;filler&#34; episodes were pleasant enough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game,  it's just like Temple run but better and if you are just getting this game I hope you love it too
1250027624|4.0|All the details you wanted to know and then some. Raised conversations regarding class society incorporating  England's hisroty and performances.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Prince is one of the greatest musicians of all time! This is an example of some of his best work!
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I enjoyed this season, its what got me addicted to the show, and I ordered season 2 quickly after. if you like myth and fantasy you will probably like this.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I got into this series late, so I decided to start catching up now.  This is a pretty good start!
B007R41E8O|5.0|You will again stay up late into the night playing this game! You won't want to leave it alone! You'll make up excuses to stay home from work! Don't let the Boss know your playing this on his time. They tend to get cranky!!!!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Very dark book. Would have been ok if he didn't include the real ending. I would not recommend the book.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|season 1 starts like most zombie movies, you get to know the characters, and you want them to survive, the tension around this really grabs the audience.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|How many stars do I give this master work, Amazon? All of them! I give all kinds of stars here!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typically Grisham. Holds your attention from the first page. Too bad there aren't many more like him. I enjoyed it very much.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very surprised at the twists and turns in this book. Nothing was as it seemed in the beginning. A real page turner.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This is such a fun series.  I've read so many historical fiction novels about King Henry VIII so it is really interesting to see it all in action.  The characters are so well cast that you truly believe they are who they portray (albeit Henry is probably better looking in the movie...).  I highly recommend this series.  Can't wait to watch rest.
B00005JOA0|5.0|YES! It's a great story, very complex and interesting, the  quality was good. And Toby Stephens is in it. Enough said.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It was a cute movie. As anything that Ashton Kutxher does, it dissent take a lot of thinking. It was enjoyable enough to watch once.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Great show, thank you amazon for making it possible for me to watch this show will stationed over seas......thank you very much
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Entertaining and easy to watch. Would recommend  . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1451629192|1.0|Bought it for my granddaughter for her English class.  This is what's wrong with our education system.  In a highly technical world we require our children to read this crap.  I don't understand the benefit of this publication in a public school system.
B0028K3192|4.0|I listen to this cd frequently.  It is actually my 2nd time buying it since my first one was lost in a car accident.  I wouldn't normally buy a cd twice but like it that much.  It has Maxwell's singature style.  The first three tracks are my fave.  And it has some smooth jazz in the later half of the cd.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Olved all the books.  Would love to read more by author.  Just liked everything about this book.  Want more on this topic.
0446401307|5.0|There are times when Harry Bosch just makes me squirm because he can be a real horse's patoot. In The Overlook, by Michael Connelly, a doctor who works in nuclear medicine is killed, and some cesium goes missing, the FBI gets involved because of the possibility of the cesium being used in a terrorist attack. Never one to work or play well with others, Harry is so focused on solving the homicide that he ignores the very real threat of the possibility of massive deaths due to the release of radioactive material. Bosch is even more prickly than usual when dealing with the FBI, perhaps because one of the agents involved is his former lover, Rachel Waller. Bosch violates chain of command, going straight to the Police Chief in his attempt to keep from being shut out of the case, and in a really hard to listen to scene, handcuffs an FBI agent and leaves him in the murder victim's house. On the one hand, there is this guilty bit of satisfaction in seeing Bosch act the way most people would only dream about, but on the other hand, I cringed while listening to it, knowing that Bosch is inappropriately taking out his frustrations against a guy who was just trying to do his job.<br /><br />It's also difficult listening to the way Harry treats his partner, Ignacio Ferras--he is non-communicative, he expects Ferras to follow his orders without explanation, and he totally disregards Ferras's objections whenever Ferras questions Bosch's actions. I think that having Bosch as a partner would be a constant exercise in frustration, and I would probably smack him before the end of my first day.<br /><br />Yet, this is precisely what makes Bosch so loveable--he stands for the victims. He doesn't care who the victim is or what the victim may have done--he is entirely focused on obtaining justice for that victim and nothing will stand in his way. Not the FBI, not protocol, not a young partner who cares too much about SOP's and not enough for justice. Bosch is a homicide detective, and thatis his entire life. I have to admire his focus, and I have to admire his skill as a detective. He doesn't miss anything. When he is looking at a crime scene, he notices even the most insignificant details, and his mind is running and asking questions that nobody else thinks are important. Why was the clock in the doctor's bedroom unplugged? What was the picture that was removed from the wall of the victim's bedroom? Why was the trash can in the victim's garage filled with paper towels stained with grape juice?<br /><br />Bosch jumps to no conclusions, he just files everything away in his brain until the pieces finally come together in the only way possible. While the FBI is throwing all the resources of the Department of Homeland Security at trying to track down the Cesium, and while the LAPD's on Homeland Security Division is shooting up the house of a person of interest, Bosch just keeps steadily trying to put things together.<br /><br />And the thing is, if Harry doesn't play well with others, neither do others always play well with him. The FBI is notorious for coming in and shutting the local authorities out of investigations, and the police department is well known for letting politics and protocol take precedence over finding out the truth. If the FBI had not shut Harry out of the case, if they had kept him in as a local partner and given him access to the witnesses, he could have prevented what ultimately turned out to be a slew of unnecessary deaths and an embarrassment for the FBI.<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS!<br />A final bit of humor for me in the book was when Bosch finally convinces Rachel Walling that the terrorist threat is a red herring, Walling makes the remark that the terrorists could have denied their involvement till Osama bin Laden was found dead in a cave and no one would have believed them. The book, of course, was written before bin Laden was killed, but it was still funny.<br /><br />Iliked this book. It was frustrating, aggravating and hard to listen to at times, but in the end it was quite satisfying. My only problem is that it ended too soon--I always like to have things tied up with a nice bow and in this case,  I wanted to know what happened with the various characters in the book. Was Harry exposed to radiation and suffering from radiation poisoning? Did the LAPD Captain of Homeland Security suffer any consequences for storming a house, killing an innocent man and terrorizing his wife? How did the FBI react to finding out that one of their own had committed the crime and staged the terrorist threat as a red herring. Was there any vindication for Bosch at all?<br /><br />Just as a note, I listened to the audio version. The reader was okay. They added some saxophone for atmosphere and sometimes the music was too loud and drowned out the narrative. It was okay, but the music didn't add anything for me.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you like the Big Bang Theory at all then you'll like this season. Funny funny funny! I think the only thing that can be better is watching these with a pizza and a cold beer.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I have seen a couple of versions of Emma but loved this 4 part miniseries.  It described much more details in the story and added a great deal to character development.  Excellent show.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Found the writing to be poor. No interest in the characters.  Very juvenile in it take on sexuality.  Would not recommend this book.  People I have talked to who read all the books agreed with me about the writing.

B006ZAZ31U|2.0|Sorry I didn't select preview for the book before I bought it.  Just another story, anyone who ever served in a war zone and fought in combat could write their own book.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game to pass the time.  No real skill required but still fun.  Nice if you like horses.  Kids of all ages will enjoy it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was very much looking forward to reading something different from J.K. Rowling.  It is taking me forever to read.  Nothing drawing me back to it.  That is how I know I am enjoying a book...when I cannot put it down and finish very quickly.  I have been reading this book on and off for several months. Sorry, but I was disappointed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Will continue to watch series. Had a few issues with connection, but overall it worked well. Looking forward to third season.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app, but it may be confusing for children under 7. Other then that, it's great for all those horse lovers!
0375831002|5.0|i thought this book was going to be about some dude who stole books because they suck (#books) and i was totally ready to ride that train but it turns out it actually has a deep plot and stuff and that is way too complicated for me. there are no dick jokes, no racist undertones or metaphysical analysis of the wu tang clan, so it looks like im out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  A wonderful love story.  My daughter read it after I did and we can't wait to see the movie.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I purchased this as a gift.  It was very much appreciated.  It is a nice addition to any DVD collection.
0765325950|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series and would love it if Brandon Sanderson kept on writing the series or at least have an aftermath type of series based on the events following the end of this book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This games is incredible. Very interesting &amp; good story.  This deserves 5 stars for sure!  It keeps you on your toes and wanting more.  It is a good length and has awesome graphics.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Difficult to say any more than the obvious - does exactly what you want it to....tells me how much battery life I have left.  I have not tested it's accuracy, but it works for me.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators --<br />I thought this was one of Grisham's best novels.  Good story line.  Easy to read and held my interest.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my 8 yr old daughter has had her heart set on being a vet. for many years :D she loves this game and plays it every day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST TEMPLE RUN YET I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME I WOULD GET THIS APP IT IS GOOD  AND FANTASTIC OMG GET IT
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, I wish I had this book while on vacation because I can't put it down and I am missing work! Smartly written with wit and excitement!  The science is a little heady but it adds to the credibility of the story line.  Read this book!
B006LSZECO|1.0|why anyone would want to read about two such banal and evil people is the real mystery.  couldn't care less about these two empty soul-less people. have we really fallen so low as to &#34;entertain&#34; ourselves reading about such utterly unremarkable purely selfish characters? ugh
B008TMA1LY|3.0|The game is cute but very challenging and for a child it's too DIFFICULT!!  You have to purchase the hearts will real $$ to unlock characters, but if ALL characters were used with coins it would make it alot easier than spending our real $$! Characters should be able to be bought with the coins we earned!! Just my thought :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|just finished the whole game in one sitting can't wait for the continuement. kind of repetitive but addictive first half of the game is better
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome!!! It is not a spoof or a rip off if you know what I mean. Oh and if you spend the seven bucks I highly recommend the pocket editor as well. The seed that's the mostly for you adventurers is dumbocow. Also try nyan. Its got some surprises.
B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed the book but not the very best book I've ever read.  Still I am glad I bought it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|So many people were talking about this show that I finally had to watch it.  And now I am hooked.  I just finished season 2 and can't wait to start season 3.
B0098460O4|5.0|This is a must purchase item if you are a fan.  Jonathan and Charlotte are superb.  Excellent choices in selections to showcase both of them.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great music!  I have listened to this a jillion times!  Wonderful talent showcased on this cd.  Can't wait for their next one!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I love the story and the way it is told.  Description of living conditions along different political regimes in Afghanistan and their influence on  of women is really interesting.
B007V65R54|5.0|What a great read. I enjoyed his 538 blog during the election so wanted to read this.  The range of topics he covers and discusses is fascinating. Quite thought provoking!
B004DNWPY4|2.0|I felt too much emphasis was placed on charting and statistics. Not enough was stated about how to really save money. My children can remember 4 different meals from a cheap 7-bone beef roast. I guess I expected reporting of extreme economizing so I was disappointed in the contents overall in 'The Millionaire Next Door'.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Game is so different then temple run. It is different because there is only one monkey and there is a hanglider.
B008M9PHWM|4.0|Tempest is a very good record, even though Bob's voice is gone. Sad but true. But the songs are pretty amazing, some of his best lyrics in a long time are here. This pack is cheap considering you'll have the album (I collect them all) and a cd copy. Worst thing: the bloddy envelope: they shoud include the cd artwork as well!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books of fiction I've read, makes you hunger (no pun intended) for morer.  Am currently on the second book of the series, Catching Fire, and will be hungry for more.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|What fun to see my favorite costume drama again. The intrigues and dramas of the serving class and those they serve is underscored by the predjudices and rigid rules of both. Even though episodes 2,3 and 4 are in black and white for some reason, the stories glue you to the screen. You can almost taste Mrs. Bridges haute cuisine!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's the best game ever it's kids favorite it keeps you busy and quiet u can get it on any device it's really cool ur kids probably already know about it and played it before...
B00881VLCE|5.0|My 3 year old loves puzzles and this app is so easy for her to use. I highly recommend this app!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it!!!I love it!! I love it!!I love it!!I love it!!I love it!! Really? How many times do I have to write this??
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I really liked that the whole family could watch this together and enjoy it.  It wasn't too scary for our (sensitive) daughter and adults could enjoy it too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent plotting, character development, acting.....what more do you need?  Review requires 11 more words, so I'm filling it with this!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it does get stuck from time to time but the game itself is fun. it is on the simple side good for early elementary age
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It makes you further and what happen next. It is very interesting too. I will  tell all my closest friends about it.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Not much to say, except Rufus W. has a plaintiff tone to all of his &#34;songs&#34;--wonderful, emotive, empathetic and very comforting/rewarding lyrics and sound.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app. Really addicting. It is a really good app. I love it because of the color and the bonuses
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book a lot. It's kept me busy. I personally like a bit of romance in books. I think it gives the book a bit of a twist.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND ENTERTAINING. I AM A BIG FAN F BBC MOVIES . WOULD DEFINATELY WATCH AGAIN . WOULD RECOMMEND.
B009CF7GRY|2.0|I never saw the original and having seen this, I will not be.  It's supposed to be a dance movie, but there's not much dancing.  The acting from the leads is pretty terrible.  The protagonist's accent comes and goes throughout the movie.  Whenever someone mentions Boston, he'll remember that he's supposed to have the accent, but the rest of the time, it's just flat.  Julianne Hough is cute, but not a great actress, and she doesn't get to show off much dancing, which seems like a shame.  I thought it was fun seeing the Deadwood reunion between Ray McKinnon and Kim Dickens, but that's certainly not enough to recommend that anyone sit through this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All i can say is you just have to watch. this is by far the best series i have ever seen.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE, IF YOU HAVE THE 1ST. SEASON. THIS IS THE BEST  SERIES I HAVE SEEN SO FAR.
B004N6369Y|3.0|As with her other books, this one was filled with great descriptions of places and people, it just seemed a little bland and like nothing really happened.  I enjoyed reading it, I always learn a little bit about different places when I read her books, this just wasn't a 'wow' in my opinion.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Awesome game love it!!!<br />Would recommend it and the other dash games with Flo!!<br />They have it for computer also. Can't wait to see if they come out with more versions.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun challenge skill graphics are well done good them many puzzles worked in my kindle fire better than the phone def recommended play it fir awhile you nay get  hooked
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful acting, good plot,  Love it!<br />Have had a couple of glitches with the streaming, it could be our device, not sure.<br />Delighted to find series 2 on Amazon Prime. Thanks Amazon!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I had high hopes for this movie. For a 'chick flick' while doing toes, it's not bad. I had hoped for a bit more comedic relief, but much was pre-canned humor and allot of per-concieved societal norms placed upon characters.<br /><br />Cute enough to watch...would not purchase it to watch again. Would watch it if it came on as part of my free Prime Amazon Instant Video or pay t.v. service.
B00797MB0O|1.0|i kept watching it because i thought/hoped that there would be something learned by the shallow, narcissistic former prom queen who never grew up. nope. glad it was at least free with prime.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Had to drag myself away from it when I couldn't hold my eyes open anymore. I love all is books!
B0091W5UWG|5.0|I really enjoyed the main characters and the relationships they portrayed.<br />I need more words to complete this review, so I added this sentence.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|I am hoping the DVD will work. It arrived  not wrapped in the plastic that is normally very hard to remove but in a slide in plastic bag and the inside holder was broken. The DVD was not sealed at all. I only hope the DVD's will work. I expected better of Amazon!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fast read b ecause you HAVE go find out what happens next.  Language , thoughts, of both<br />husband and wife suggest they are evil. Read it now--it will be a movie in a year.!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I am now on season 3 and actually have been clued to it all weekend. The only problem I had was with season 3....I was sent a used DVD. Was very disappointed with Amazon on that. The DVD was not wrapped or sealed and the inside holder was broken.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|The only track I really liked is Up in Flames. I think that Coldplay is a band that maybe in the future will reach the feet of U2 or Dire Straits or Pink Floyd. It is really cold like their name implies..... I think that they will never reach the perfection of Yellow.  Sorry for that...
B007IK44CK|5.0|Try it u will love it.it was one of da best movie i have seen so far.i just came here 2 give a review becoz it deserved it
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Got a little off track (I thought, like trying to get enough pages to make a book) at one point but still interesting.  The ending wrapped everything up neatly but was a bit of a let down.  I guess I'm more of a romantic than I like to admit.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie, nice spin at the end. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his better performances coupling drama and comedic relief perfectly for a movie that will keep you entertained to the end.
B001NLKT60|4.0|A good page turner with the same complaint as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the ending left me hanging but then I knew it was 2 of 3 so high hopes for the last book.
B00933JL0A|5.0|i just got the game today and started playing right away. i have been looking for a game like this for a while and im glad that i finally found it, if you like village games then this one is for you
B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|Disc 2 didn't work and was totally blank.  So I only saw disc 1.  This was the second time I had ordered the Season 2 series and the second set that had a blank disc 2.  Amazon was great and quickly sent me my replacement.  Loved Amazon, but disappointed in the quality control of the company producing the discs.
0373771665|5.0|Great story, somehow a bit more realistic than other historical Georgette Heyer novels. Lovely settings as usual, I can recommend!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Interest stays high in the second season  The quality of acting is so tied to the excellent story. Maggie Smith shines; the fewest words have the most import. I am a \\"period piece\\" buff and the costumes and scenery and culture keep me watching with enthusiasm.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was easy to see where the story was going. No big surprises.  If you watched Sleeping with the Enemy they are a lot alike.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|always handy and I love the visual cue of last number used on the bar beneath the screen.  great app and free!
B009G78EE2|2.0|I enjoyed thrift store a lot but when I listened to the entire cd it's a little depressing. The happy songs are great the depressing songs are good, but so depressing. I cannot listen to it when I want to be pumped up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game challenging and fun yet frustrating at times.  It's hard to put down.  Fast moving and that beast is scary.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|The book raises lots of issues about vision, behaviour and organisation structure.  An interesting read, although perhaps a little too long.  I would have liked a more detailed discussion about how his impending death might have caused a rethink of some of his positions.
1451648537|5.0|I had to read this book for my book club and I was dreading it.  I don't own any apple products.  I found the book interesting, almost inspiring.  You can do something even if the odds are against you.  I also understand more why I don't own apple products, but that is why there is choice. I would recommend this to everyone who has a dream and is willing to pay the price to make it come true.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|It is so beautiful and very touching story, a really good story that has important morals. The animation is amazing (again XD) and the music is very beautiful.<br /><br />I think Belle is the best character that they ever made . She's smart, beautiful (both inner and outer), compassionate and she loves books and adventure . In this movie, everybody in the village think that Belle is \\"strange\\" all because she always like to read and daydream but they still think she's beautiful. But Belle doesn't care about her beauty, just enjoying her reading and hoping to have an adventure. Also she's a brunette like me XD.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a good time killer but  is repetitive.the characters are not easy to get.I have a mixed review on this game.
B0001I561E|5.0|How awesome is that this film is based on one of the famous tales of 1001 Arabian Nights. I just love it! The animation, the characters and the music, they are all so great. Even though the movie have some complains from the people because of the racial issues back then but I don't really care, I'm Italian and I believe it's an awesome movie.<br /><br />Jasmine is exotic and strong-minded character, how can anyone don't like her ? She's very beautiful character with head-strong personality and she's the only Arabian princess in Disney ever. She's a type of lady who truly believes that she will marry for love, not for royalty reasons and she hate to be treated like a trophy (I totally agree ). Jasmine felt trapped in her own palace and wants to be free; even she's not yet street-smarts on the outside world like Aladdin. But she is after all a fast-learner.
1452110581|5.0|Well written, witty and super funny. I gave these to my cat and non cat owners and they equally loved them
B000F8O35U|5.0|I love this movie because it is so fluid the animation and the story is beautiful (even though it changed the original tale of The Little Mermaid, but they do have reason why). Colorful characters. I love the oceanic settings and colors and of course... I love mermaids.<br /><br />The reason Ariel is one of my favorite heroines is because even though she is not wise to make a deal with the devious sea witch, but she still follow her heart and risk everything to have her dreams come true.
1449410243|5.0|This was a huge hit with all my friends. It's filled with a lot of funny and witty content. Adorable
B00B2EWNWG|3.0|I was trying to get into this movie, martial arts and all, but then this<br />hiphoprapcrap music started making noise and I couldn't put the<br />two, together.... Why is it Liu alway end up dead!?  And Crowe better<br />go on a diet!  But, for the most part, I enjoyed it; except for the<br />hiphoprapcrap music...
B00AQMQBKK|3.0|I was very excited to finally see some FFG offerings in the Kindle app store. Then I downloaded one. I can't really review a game that won't work, can I?  The help menu videos crash the app whenever I start them. Enabling video in the settings doesn't help. I predict I've just wasted $4.00.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br /><br />OK. After some poking around I found the help menu has the game instructions as text. I'd suggest to FFG, they'd actually be OK without the videos. I have a feeling all they do is take up space. I played the game with video reenabled and the cut screen videos actually work, just not the tutorials.<br /><br />Game play is actually quite fun and challenging. The number of investigators and the random adventures help with replayability. So, I'll upgrade this from a 1 star to a 3 star.
B005LAII80|2.0|I bought this movie expecting violence and that it was.  But I also bought it expecting good 3d effects and it was sorely lacking in that respect.  Not impressed.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie, which may or may not imply I've been living in a box since its release.  Who'd pay attention to something called &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34;?  But I loved this movie enough to recommend it to anybody who'd stand still long enough to listen to me.  Its theme is implausibly simple:  An aggressive English politico, played flawlessly by wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas, decides to &#34;lighten up&#34; the dark and dismal sides of the war in the Middle East  by finding something to distract the public.  That something turns out to be a wealthy sheik's desire to introduce salmon into the bone-dry Yemen.  The technology involved in this goofy idea will cost millions, but he's willing to spend it.  And guess what?  He's not doing this purely so he can selfishly fish in his own backyard; he wants to pull together all those who will be involved in the project, including Emily Blunt, who represents the &#34;agency&#34; that handles his finances; and Ewan McGregor, who believes salmon won't survive in the desert any better than ravens will swim at the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that Emily's soldier boyfriend is mia in Afghanistan and Ewan's marriage should have been scrapped years ago, and you have the unlikely basis for love.  As you'd expect, these two are brought together as their individual and mutual passions for succeeding in their project grow.  Predictably, Emily's boyfriend miraculously survives an attack that killed everyone in his squad, showing up just when things look like they might work out for her and Ewan.  But the resolution is lovely, even if you think it's as improbable as a few salmon surviving the subterfuge that destroys the entire project.<br /><br />Most impressive is that the sheik is shown in a believably favorable light, which flies in the face of present-day racial profiling and bigotry.  Although he is the victim of &#34;bad Arabs&#34;, he's unquestionably a &#34;good Arab&#34;, a visionary, a poet, a man of faith and a believable hero.  It's about time the entire world saw a portrait of a middle-Easterner that was not designed by George Bush.  There is good in every group, and it's nice to be reminded of this in a movie.<br /><br />Please give &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; a look-see.  It's delightful.ionary, a poet, a man of faith and a believable hero.  It's about time the entire world saw a portrait of a middle-Easterner that was not designed by George Bush.

B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Entertaining movie for the grandkids.  They especially liked the 3d effects as I did also.  Would recommend for 3d viewers.
B0000542D2|5.0|I was a child when &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34; hit the big screen, and was so thrilled to see the Beatles larger than life, even if they were in black and white, that I loved it.  Seen in the 21st century, the movie's a bit creaky; but it's still obvious that all a filmmaker had to do was point a camera at John, Paul, George and Ringo, and the magic took over.<br /><br />There's no point in iterating this lightweight plot, because the style of the film so far outweighs it, the viewer comes away with more images than story.  This was the seminal exploration of herky-jerky, artsy filmmaking based on a highly accessible subject (the Beatles), and it's fascinating as a work of filmic art.  Moreover, it's a piece of history, and well worth watching.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Good movie but lacking in the &#34;wow&#34; effects that I like in 3d effects.  Had some quality special effects with the fighting scenes.
B005FITIDC|4.0|I really like Gerard Butler, and always wonder why he chooses such awful projects.  Based on the tacky title, I expected &#34;Machine Gun Preacher&#34; to fall into that category; but actually, apart from the gore and fact that Butler's character is generally amoral and loathsome, it's a good movie.<br /><br />Butler is a junky drug dealer who, after nearly killing a man in a fit of rage, finds religion through the faith of his devoted wife.  Because he is fundamentally an obsessive person, he takes his new beliefs to an extreme, traveling to Africa to help dispossessed orphans.  He is deeply moved by the plight of these children, but an inherently violent man, it doesn't take long before he is militaristically embroiled in a veritable war in Africa.  His initially heroic stance becomes increasingly paranoid and borderline evil, and eventually he is little better as a man than his enemies.<br /><br />Butler is a sensitive performer under his muscle suit, and he portrays his growing awareness of his own flaws with depth and eloquence.  This is based on a true story, unbelievable as the movie may be; but it is Butler and the children of Africa who elevate it to something special and moving.<br /><br />Please get past the exploitive title and watch &#34;Machine Gun Preacher&#34;.  In the final analysis, it's a meaningful film.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Speedy delivery, excellent condition.  A Christmas gift received in plenty of time.  My daughter has enjoyed many hours of entertainment from the many movies she received for Christmas.  I would buy from this seller again.
B001J4E1D8|3.0|Thomas Hardy must have been a very unhappy man.<br /><br />Every time it looks like the plot of this gothic period story might take a happy turn, a character makes a terrible choice that ruins everybody's life.  Poor Tess.  She's doomed, through no fault of her own.  On the other hand, the very fact that this film is ultimately so upsetting attests to the quality of the production.  If you want a happy ending, watch Jane Austen.  If you want to be depressed for a few days, watched Tess of the D'Urbervilles.<br /><br />You can get the plot from Wikipedia, but what it basically boils down to is this:  Tess is an innocent, beautiful young girl whose inebriated father mistakenly believes his family is descended from royalty.  Eager to better their lot in life, his sends Tess to work for the actual last descendants of the once noble D'Urbervilles, where she is unpleasantly courted and ultimately raped by the young heir.<br /><br />Tess runs away, has a baby out of wedlock, the baby dies and Tess, determined to make her own way, goes to work on a farm. There, she meets a man she saw once before and instantly fell in love with, and that relationship grows into an innocent, pure love.  He is the son of a wealthy family and wants to marry Tess but the morals of the time being what they are, she refuses, finally agreeing on the basis that she will share the horrible echoes of her past with her new husband.  He accepts this lovingly, but when she confesses the truths of her former immorality, he leaves her, and her life goes rapidly downhill from there.<br /><br />Tess ends up slaving in a cruel potato factory, where the dreadful young D'Urberville heir who raped her finds her once again.  He's still obsessed with her, and although she refuses his unrelenting advances, her longing for the husband who has deserted her ultimately drives her into his arms.  He has played the one trump card she can't refused:  He's bought her family, making their lives better while destroying Tess'.<br /><br />Her husband, recovering from a dreadful illness and still in love with Tess, tracks her down, begging forgiveness and anxious to start their marriage in faith.  Tess is now her enemy's mistress, filled with self-loathing and hatred for him.  She commits the ultimate crime to escape her horrible situation, killing the man she hates and fleeing to the one she loves.<br /><br />The young couple enjoys a period of bliss while trying desperately to escape the recriminations of the Law, and at last, Tess is taken.  She is put to death by hanging, the final page in a tragic chapter of an unreasonably misused life.<br /><br />This is very well done, all performances outstanding, settings magnificent, fine scripting, directing, producing.  But God, it's depressing.

B003HARV3Y|1.0|I haven't read the books, based on this movie have no desire to do so, and thought &#34;Percy Jackson&#34; was absolutely dreadful.  Bad writing, mediocre acting, silly effects; barf.  I won't bother describing the plot, but highly recommend you watch something else unless you're  under ten years of age.

B008YWY0HK|3.0|Visually, \\"Brave\\" is stunning, with the usual excellent soundtrack and voices expected of such movies these days.  But what's it about?  Damned if I know.<br /><br />The heroine is a willful, capable young woman who can outride, outshoot and outthink nearly everyone she comes in contact with.  Her mother annoys her, however, so what does she do?  She seeks out a witch, who transforms her mother into a non-speaking bear.  Then what happens?  A bunch of stuff that doesn't really amount to a hill of beans.<br /><br />Maybe I just didn't get \\"Brave\\", because I'm not a kid.  But I've loved nearly every other CGI animated movie of this type, and this one left me cold.  If you're looking for a saga of a young woman using her heroic gifts and achieving great things, I believe you'll be disappointed.  I frankly think \\"Tangled\\" is a better movie involving billowing hair.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I downloaded this app for my smart phone and find that the program for Chess Free provides chess games for all ages and all different levels of beginner to expert chess players.  Relaxing but uses the gray cells.
B000VSBX34|3.0|I was a kid when &#34;Help!&#34; hit the big screen, and remember that as a Beatles fan, I was put off by how dumb the story was and how long it took to tell it.  Truly, this is a pretty terrible movie but very much of its time, with that op art visual sensibility and a feeble attempt at the disjointed &#34;Hard Days Night&#34; styling.  John, Paul, George and Ringo come off very well, and the rest of the cast is professional and good; but honestly, &#34;Help&#34; is lousy.<br /><br />For the one person reading this review who never saw &#34;Help!&#34;, it involves an Eastern religious cult that wants to murder Ringo because he's accidentally wearing their sacrificial ring.  The wily Beatles are chased all over England and the Bahamas, and good wins out in the end; but who really cares?  You watch this for up-close-and-personal images of the Beatles, the great music and the fun.  Unfortunately, for this viewer, there is too little of the latter to justify the rest, which is a bunch of fine English character actors you'd like to boo off the screen so you can get back to the Beatles.<br /><br />I'd rather watch &#34;A Hard Days Night&#34; or maybe just reminisce about how wonderful the Beatles were to pre-pubescent girls all over the world.  &#34;Help!&#34; is just plain stupid.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I downloaded this app a few months ago and having been using regularly since.  This is a great tool for your current location as well as looking at different locations that you are going to be traveling to.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|A short, easy read.  Too many things going on and not enough of the story dedicated to developing the plot.  Cute story though.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I have not used the Documents to Go full version key yet.  I will be better able to provide feedback once I have researched and used.  I expect to start this process in the next few months.
0765325950|5.0|Was Very happy how this Book turned out. Fans of the series will not be disappointed. A must Read !!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I downloaded Pac-Man lite to my smart phone a few weeks ago.  I was hoping it would be simiilar to Pac Man and it is to a certain degree, but not as most enjoyment as I remember from years ago.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Nice try, but no matter how hard they try nothing can beat the original with Kevin Bacon! Now he get's 5 stars!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have enjoyed the book. It's a nice read. It didn't live up to all the hype for myself though. I never really found myself staying up because I couldn't just stop turning the pages. But still, overall an enjoyable read.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Not sure I understood the whole story but it didn't make much sense to us.  It was ok but not something I would watch again
B000AAF1U4|5.0|bought this as a gift for my sister - it was just what she wanted! Brand-new, fast shipping, and such a cute movie!  She loves it!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I understand that a non-PC version may be a bit limited, but this is pretty basic in function and display.  Works well enough to get by when I don't have my PC available or time to fire it up.  The iPhone version functions as well.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It's the second book of Ken Follett that i have read, both very good.  I like the subject, the history of the First world War, when my parents were 15 and 12 year old and watched their friends go to war in Hungary.  After this, the Second World War, when i was eight year old.  Ken Follett chose the saga of families to follow up to my adult life.  It's a different way of studying and understanding History, that I lived in a non-European country.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has a great twist! Never saw that coming!!!!!!! I will most definitely be reading the book again! I totally recommend it!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story was obe of those that it was hard to put down.  It flipped from his childhood to adulthood and showed the results of one on the other.  It was almost a mystery but was fun to see unfold.  I loved it and will look for othre books by the same author int the future.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel should win another Oscar for this performance. He definitely makes you wonder how close to reality this could be. The acting is superb, the story is wonderful. I cannot say enough about this film.<br /><br />Bravo, ladies and Gentlemen, bravo.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have a tendacy to misplace cords to my electronics which is exactly what I did in this case.  Knowing that I could order a new one and have it available when one is misplaced.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The descriptions really made you feel right there with the characters. Loved it. Will definitely read more by this author.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like this book very much this is the best book I  have ever read in my house.. my sister loves it too
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I wanted to be able to watch this movie again but with the new technology was only able to watch it on a small tv that had vhs capability so the effect wasn't as dramatic as watching it on a large LED HDTV!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One of the most romantic, most inspiring and yet saddest books I've ever read, could not take my eyes out of it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read this because of all the hype.  Everyone I know was talking about it and I couldn't contribute without reading it.  Not too impressed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such an incredible game!!!! Loved it and all the characters! Definitely recommend this to everybody! Download now, it's totally worth it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn!!  His stories are always entertaining and very up-to-date.  Hope to see a movie some day soon.  Just hope he does a better job of picking the actor to portray his hero than Lee Child did for Jack Reacher.
0345803493|5.0|i chose the rating because the story between the two people is different than anything else i have read. and keeps your interest captured, hoping the two of them find a way..
B0037EAJAC|5.0|Good story with beautiful pictures. Brilliant scene of war. It has everything I like. Akira Kurosawa is a great director.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love to hate those pigs!  Sometimes they can get the best of me.  Totally addicting game - truly recommend for a pass-time.
B00000F214|1.0|My title says it all. How anyone can even find this movie remotely interesting is beyond me. It should be buried in a hole one mile deep in Siberia and forgotten forever. What an absolute FAILURE on all levels!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The first several games were almost too easy, but higher levels started making you think before acting and much fun.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|So much better than the original cast movies I, III, IV, and V; reflects the best of the original series storylines, where an engaging enemy is required - Christopher Plummer is great as Chang, and Kim Cattrall is very convincing as Valeris.  If the viewer engages this movie not expecting the stars (pun fully intended), then it works.
159562015X|4.0|Quite an interesting approach. Fairly quick read since once I had gone online and determined my strengths I only read those 5 of 34 that applied to me which I found to be reasonably accurate and insightful. I like the approach of leveraging your positive traits as opposed to wasting a lot of time on those that need \\"correcting\\". (No matter how much time I practice, 5'9\\" me is not going to make it in the NBA or the NFL!)
B004UID2LC|2.0|Maybe I didn't understand how to use this app, but it just didn't do anything I needed.  I wanted to be able to search things on this app and could not.  I think I just needed to understand it better.  I didn't keep it as I needed more space.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Better than most film adaptations of this kind of novel. Because of the lack of character development of Swagger's earlier years one doesn't know why or who he really is.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|The whole family watches this movie and we love that we have it on the road as well as at home.  It is fabulous.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is GREAT and I'm very glad The Man's still at it, but he doesn't credit a forebear from whom he has evolved. Who was the soul singer who had a hit in 1966 with Open the Door to Your Heart, aka Walk Right On In? There is not one mention of his name on the liner notes. Otherwise, this CD couldn't be better! The music, the wisdom, the candor, the experience, the worldliness makes me feel I've just travelled from Northern Ireland to the French Rivera!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love being able to play this on a tablet vs. my phone because I can see it better.  It hasn't had any glitches since I loaded it and my daughter and I both play it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|these lee child jack reacher series books are the best, quick and great action with a touch of mystery and thriller.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I accidentally downloaded this but was happy to have it for a while. It sure brought me back to my child hood, but I am not a gamer, so the controller was hard to get used to.  I actually did not keep this app in lieu of space for something else for my child.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Adult NEVER-ENDING STORY?<br /><br />Heard the author interviewed on NPR and intrigued, listened on Audible. Sent the paperback to engineer daughter who found a surprise when she went to read it one night.<br /><br />Modern story takes place in San Francisco, New York, and... in a bookstore, at Google, and... we had varied opinions on Epilogue -- I liked it :)
B001QFZADA|5.0|This is a great eye opening book.  The insight is wonderful. The book is easy to read and to follow.  I am applying it to my every day life. I definitelywill recommend to others.
1616550414|5.0|I am so honored to have this in my library. The Hyrule Historia book is something I have been waiting for ever since I became a Zelda fan so many years ago. Everything about this book is wonderful! Such an awesome piece of memorabilia for any fan of Link and his adventures throughout time. ^^!
B002QNTNL6|5.0|one of her favorite movies.....<br />and my 17yr old loves it, my 19yr old likes it and I really enjoyed it.....
B00846F1YW|5.0|Mysteryville 2 worked great on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I enjoyed this game as much as I did the first one. Heavy on hidden object scenes but also includes a few puzzles. I wish they would figure out how to do the dialogue so it's not so tedious. Glad you can skip dialogue through the menu. Fast game but fun.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Haven't finished yet, but interesting, Real fantasy stuff. Interesting new subject, but fits with the whole genre of magic and paranormal.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Different to some people that didn't like the remastered parts of the dvds, I don't actually mind them. I didn't give it 5 stars cause the box of Season 1 came with some weird stains on it and I haven't been able to clean it. But it was like $80 cheaper than the one sold by amazon and the DVDs are in good condition so I guess there is always a catch with things being cheaper!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very addicting. It's a game to pass the time while waiting on other stuff, such as friends or while your cooking.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|It's a great concept, but the lenses are terrible and it distorts the image from the Kinect so bad that it renders the Kinect inoperable. When I tried it it would constantly lose track of me and had a lot of blind spots. So I hooked my Kinect up to my computer so I could better see what the Kinect was seeing and the image was incredibly distorted with big black fuzzy areas all over the place. No wonder it was losing track of me. Great concept, but poor execution. How about some better quality materials and quality control Nyko.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Can't wait to watch the second season. Walter and Peter are very entertaining.<br />Why are the other seasons so expensive with Prime?
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Again, I must say how much I love this show. I've always enjoyed cop dramas and futuristic, sci-fi shows and this is an amazing blending of the two. I enjoy the characters and their little nuances. This show is a mix of cop dramas, futuristic sci-fi and the bizarre with some really great acting.
B008BP097A|5.0|I have been listening to Melody Gardot ever since her interview on public radio a few years back.  Since then, her music never ceases to amaze and transport.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Excellent British series of the earliest years of the 20th century of the two classes of people, the servant class and the upper crust of society, thier lives and and their interaction. The characters are rooted in realism and the actors did a great job so the audience can identify with some, get to love some , respect a few and hate others. I really looked forward to viewing each episode.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|Caro Emerald's unique take on music leaves the listener breathless and trembling, awaiting the next line, the next tune.  One is transported back and forth in time and space as the music hearkens back to the sounds of the first half of the 20th Century (think speakeasies and Harlem Renaissance) and then moves on to the cadences made popular by Perez Prado and Antonio Carlos Jobim.  Yes, she is that good!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun to play but the next day most of your coins are gone.Once you start you can't get off.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this series. I just started watching it on netflix just to see what it was about. After watching a few episodes I was totally hooked! Pretty decent mystery/drama!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|There are heartbreaks and tearjerks galore.  But it never felt so good. Costume and acting are superb.  I felt totally transported in time.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not sure how i got hooked on a show with such a violent story line. The characters grow on you and you become engrossed in the battle between good and evil.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Since Book 3 is mainly a continuation of Book 2's plotline, this novel starts slowly.  In fact, I was dismayed, early-on, at the seemingly conventional espionage-angle the plot was taking.  Fortunately, Larsson dumped conventionality shortly thereafter, and the book became as exhilerating as its predecessors.  I hated to finish because I knew there would not be a fourth book in the series.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I loved Homeland, first season.  Claire Daynes is wonderful. Homeland is full of suspense.  I would recommend this to everyone. Can hardly wait until season 2 becomes available.
B003LPR4ZK|4.0|A love affair...with words, with books, with people never met.  Sweet anticipation vs immediate gratification.  Merchants -- real people -- in a relationship with their customers that goes far beyond &#34;personalized&#34; banner ads...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I like it because it shows truths of real life back in the day which has given us many traditions.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I've enjoyed everything by this author.  She write charming mysteries, with great locations and characters.  A fun series to read.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|In past Transformers movies, I couldn't make out the autobots vs decepticons in the battle scenes, but this one seemed to do the job a lot better.
B004SBULWE|5.0|It's great if you go on a lot of websites.  I have it on my phone too. So easy to wipe out sites that keep running, even if you're not using it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|fun game, it keeps you coming back to play. sometimes its frustrating when you cant win. good family game, everyone can play.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is great! Our kids love it and we love it too. The music is super fun. I love dr suess books and having them come to life is fun :-)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was definitely worth a 5 star rating.  I read the book in two sessions. I just couldn't put it down. The ups and downs had me experiencing every emotion. I wanted to scream at them. I wanted to cry with them. I wanted to smile with them. The fights, gambling, and fire made the story even more suspenseful. I left wanting to more.... I'll be reading it again!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|We went out and bought the trilogy. My son loves this movie. It was a great gift for my son.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know what all the hype is all about. I can't get passed Chapter 3. I have put the book away and have no desire to find out what's next. Very boring read.
B000I9W08I|5.0|A fun, feel good movie! I could watch it over and over again. This is a great movie for anyone who likes nostalgic musicals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because it has every thing in a game from temple run to dodginng<br /> things :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|There are a lot different games starting at an easy level and working up. Then there are challenge games. I am constantly using this during my down time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing, I can't believe I waited so long to read this!! Wonderful writing, a truly riveting story. Can't wait to find out what happens next.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I have always loved sci-fi shows just wish I could see season 5. LOVE THE ACTORS AND THE STORY LINE CAN'T wait to watch the last season
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy this game and so dose my 7 and 3 year old. With three different style games to play zen, classic and arcade there's a fun way to play this game for everyone in the family.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read Safe Haven and enjoyed it.  Like all of Nicholas Sparks books, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|First of all, I love my new kindle. It's so easy to use and the picture comes in really good for the video. I'm enjoying watching the tudors. .
1861085257|4.0|Miniature foods masterclass has many fine details about the construction of some of the fussier miniature foods that were eluding me. Lots of clear pictures and instructions made this book a worthwhile purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Not a cliche ending. Very good. Not one for romances, but I loved it. Unpredictable. Can't wait for the movie.<br />I absolutely loved it and I could not put the book down.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My 10 year old loves it!  This is the coolest lego product ever made!  It has all the internal &#34;camper&#34; supplies also!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I upgraded from a Kindle to a Kindle Fire and then got a 10\\" android tablet. I gave the Kindle to a friend, the Kindle Fire to my wife and I use the Kindle app on my tablet. I am an avid reader and had trouble storing and/or discarding all my hard back books. The Kindle family of products solved my problem and I save a little by buying ebooks rather than hard backs.<br /><br />Another really cool thing about \\"Kindle for Android\\" is another app called \\"Overdrive Media Console\\". You can sign up for ebooks from your local public library (for free) and use \\"Overdrive\\" to sync borrowed library (text or audio)books with your device (phone, tablet, Kindle or other ereader).
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I really think all good storytelling is character driven, and Fringe has truly wonderful characters. The science fiction base is creative but close enough to everyday reality to relate to, and J.J. Abrams humor keeps it from getting bogged down into the gloom and doom. It's also one of those series where you see more of the threads that hold it together when you watch it over again.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Iron Man movies peaked my interest in these Marvel based comics turned movies. I was told I needed to watch this one before Avengers, etc. Glad I did. I really enjoyed it.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I am a huge fan of G5 games but not this one. way to short and not a good story line. the ho were difficult to get...I had to touch the object several times before it would come off the list. the scenes were bare and not at all interesting. no way I would buy the sequel. I am actually surprised this came from G5 would expect from other companies but not them.
B0095P33IW|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, especially the story involving Stark Sr. and the old style tributes to the era.<br />Didn't like it as much as Thor, but almost.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is so captivating it keeps your attention and keeps you conning back to see what will happen next
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book, great author....I am HOOKED on Sylvia Day!  You should read the whole series, then move on tho her other series!!
0140282033|4.0|I bought this book because it was recommended to me because I liked The Chocolatier's Wife.  It was, of course, considerably different, but still yummy and intriguing.  I would recommend it!
B005H9B44A|2.0|Thor- good effects and a lousy script. it could have been much better. I'm glad I didn't have to  pay to see it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great book, once again by Clancy.  Interesting in following the possibilities of world threats against the US and the realization of cyber warfare.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved the take of this post-zombie-apocalypse novel.  More of a study of humanity's resiliency than your traditional zombie book.  While the interview-like format is not for everyone, the story is still nonetheless great.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is so well done it is scary. Thoughtful, interesting, insighful and teaches the viewer the real power of observation. No tricks just paying attention.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is great I have bought a lot of different alarms and this is the only one that worked it never crashed my kindle I never had any issues I really appriciate it telling u haw many hours of sleep you'll get for those who had issues or had to shut down there kindle I have no idea what your talking about plus alot of people said u have to leave it on to work and that's a bunch or bologna beaches I turn it of every night and it still wakes me up every morning so ya I don't know what and of the people who gave it one star are talking about
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is exciting. There are twists and turns you never see coming.  There are rich complex characters with realistic flaws and traits.  You'll question your own judgement of the characters and the situation.<br />I could read this again and again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Turned onto Downton Abbey by a friend and now I am hooked! Highly recommended it to those who think there is nothing good to watch on tv anymore.
B007C8671O|5.0|I could not possibly review it better than I'm sure it has been already hundreds of times over the years.
B006G2124E|5.0|i just love this movie! yup yup yup yup yup yup yup. why do i have to have this many words?
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this game very much. It keeps my mind busy and away from the refridgerator! Ha. I'm finding that MobilityWare seems to be reliable in the game department.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A gripping, reality-driven story line.  It was easy to finish the book quickly.  I enjoyed this book; although the harsh reality of teen suicide was somewhat difficult to stomach.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was looking for something different in the game department to keep my mind busy on boring plane flights. I like the fact you can pick your difficulty level.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Thanks to Amazon Prime and access to all of the episodes it's hard to just watch 1 show per night.  Have heard great show but just started watching recently. Wife enjoys it and both of us look forward to another episode each evening. Great story line and acting they should be proud of their accomplished series that they have given us.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like this product because I love reading, and with the Kindle for Android I can carry my books with me to work, or on vacation in a compact tablet, saving room in my suitcase. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to read.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Special affects were just Ok.  Scenery was nice.  Acting was barely Ok.  Very average movie.  This would not even hold a candle to the original.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|When I shut my eyes Ted sounded exactly like my brother in law who lives near Boston. I laughed, because the acting was an accurate  picture of  how funny  Massachusetts is.
B005LAII80|5.0|I enjoyed the movie but glad I didn't go to the movies to see it. Reminds me of the original.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Loved the game! Best strategy game I have ever played. I like this more than dragon vale which ruled me off sadly.  This game, however, did not. I trust it a lot and I really recommend it.
B001E9641K|5.0|it was new as they said and was in good shape.  We have had fun playing the game and highly recomend it
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Well acted. Not your usual corny plot. It amazes me that Clint can still act as well as he does. Also, Amy is very good at her part
B008I43DYU|5.0|The app installed without trouble.  The interface is clear. As everyone says, portrait is a simple calculator for arithmetic, landscape useful more sophisticated functions. So far it has not tried to call home or ask for recommendations.  Easy to use. As advertised. I would buy it again.
B009O2XY12|1.0|would be fun if you could play longer. it only lets you you play for a little while then it wants money to continue
B004X2M9VY|3.0|One of the most annoying on going story lines and characters ever created for a Dr. Who series.  She knows everything,but wait she doesn't know a thing.  She's been there, but wait she has never seen this place before.  Nauseating.  The stories that did not feature that character prominently were not too bad.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|All other Vietnam war movies after Full Metal Jackets, have it as a starting point. Incredible. Good HD quality but not superb.
B003G8Y4QO|3.0|Dr. Who is a good series, has been for all of these decades, but this Dr. Who is just too disjointed.  It gets to be a task just to sit through an episode.  But still I had to watch.  Why give up now?
B0045INOCO|5.0|The picture is off course unique, the last 30 minutes of the movie is Marlon Brando, meaning he is the movie! The quality of the digital product is really good but not excellent. It is an old film after all.
B004UPALT6|1.0|Not gonna waste more words---not good.  Must add 14 more words for this review to &#34;take&#34;, so here they are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is a total change is scenery from the usual games I<br />play. Also the game is very kid-friendly.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|Not quite as good as the original, but each season seems to be improving. Obviously, it's hard to be a successful spin-off, but this show holds my interest and I do keep coming back for more.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great way to waste time and build a world of your own. If only we could do this for real
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The story lines and character profiles remain interesting and on the edge-of-your seat thrilling.  Can't get enough of this amazing show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|perfect for kidsnor adults just beware of real life purchases<br /> would def recommend. this app even my four year old loves it!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Always has been and continues to be an outstanding show.  Love the ability to watch it whenever my schedule permits.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!!! It lets you see your friends highest score!! I've gotten to three hundred thousand something and it changes setting!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author is either crazy herself or brilliant. I'm going with brilliant. It takes an amazing author to think of all the twists and turns in this book and to create the female character with such a sinister mind. It truly was a book that you can't put down. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't like the ending. It ended too quickly but it did wrap things up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It runs smoothly and just like when  you could only play with cards it's a great go to game when you are bored.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Been using it for years on my PC and love it. I had no problem paying for it for my smart phone, syncs easily to my PC with wifi. Tried the lite version that doesn't sync, not so good.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was anticipating this book as soon as I heard about it.  In the story we are introduced to high school student Sky.  She has been homeschooled her whole life and is about to start at public school with her bestie and neighbor Six.  Unfortunately, Six failed to mention that she would be going away for an exchange program, and Sky will have to face school all on her own.<br /><br />Soon she meets Dean Holder.  A goreous guy with an uncanny ability to make Sky feel something, which has always been impossible for her.  As things progress, she will find out more than she bargained for.<br /><br />This book tackles very mature subject mature and is not for young readers.  I would definitely recommend it though.  It is the kind of book you can totally get lost in.<br /><br />I read the reviews before I read this book, and it is quite clear that the ones who left bad reviews didn't finish the book.  The whole story is there, you can;'t give up on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive! It is a good way to test the brain in a fun way. My friends an  I all have it. I recommend this to anyone.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|it was ok, im aware alot of readers love these books but i am not that taken with them. thanks
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just got game and already I am hooked. Very entertaining keeps u on your toes.<br />Recommend highly. A must for anyone who likes games adults and children
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book had a good twist with Rickman being alive<br />One problem I have noticed with this book and all the others are typos. Not misspelled ewords but words missing to complete a sentence.  Usually two or three times a novel. Never saw that with Clancy<br />Mike poirier
B005D73ALQ|5.0|I appreciate the instrumentation of this particular group of musicians. Miles is Miles, but the rest of the ensemble is remarkable as well.<br /><br />I'm a tuba player, and a pure jazz lover, so to be able to listen to cool jazz with a tuba so prominent, is heaven for me. Love it!!!
B009NX409M|2.0|Had I know that it was about two married people falling in love, I would have never chosen to watch it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent series. Captivating story and excellent actors. You can't stop watching episode after episode. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Action, adventure, history, mystery, an evil guy or maybe a bunch of them, and a smart team of good guys make for a fast-paced, interesting read.  The central story had something to do with ancient nano-technology being let loose in current times. I didn't really understand how that would work, but the consequences were dire and it didn't matter at all to enjoying the story. This is a well-thought-out race against the clock to keep the world as we know it from being destroyed by forces of nature triggered by ancient, possibly man-made technology.  All of our favorite Sigma Force characters were there along with several native-American heroes and heroines.  Thomas Jefferson played a key role.  A satisfying race to find the clues, stop the bad guys, and save the world.  Who says conspiracy theories don't exist?
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great movie with remarkable sensitivity for an animated film about machines. Beautiful imagery and cute characters make this a very entertaining family-friendly film.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Wow what an awesome movie! I had to watch this for one of my college courses but it is definitely worth owning.  A very well put together movie!
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is really addicting but could use some updates to make game play better.You should try it out and see how you like it yourself.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like to have a one touch app to reach one of my favorite websites. I recommend everyone get the app
B0094K1JPC|5.0|We just browsing the free Amazon Prime movies and saw both Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams and thought how could we go wrong. And we were very pleased.<br /><br />It was a very entertaining story of a young blossoming producer and a bitter award-winning anchor as their careers both changed direction. Lots of laughs and surprises.<br /><br />Great movie for all. Though there is some brief near nudity and a few scenes leaning toward adult stuff (it is rated PG-13) that could have been deleted and still a great movie but for a wider audience.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It is the same anti-virus software I use on my personal computer. I have had no problem with the software.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very addictive story telling. It's hard to beat Stephen King. Definitely movie worthy. Although I rarely like the movie as well as the book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very useful and not buggy at all. i use it all the time.<br />works with my 8.9 kindle and is very easy to read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Of course I love my FB APP!! With the ease of being able to carry my Kindle Fire anywhere I can always<br />have access to FACEBOOK :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  Lots of twists and turns every chapter.  I really enjoyed this book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is bar far one of the best series to read.  Never get boring and keeps you wanting more. everyone should read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am enjoy ing  this game so far. I wish Icould understznd it a bit better at the starting levels I am on. It is nice for people who like horses.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Challenging right off the bat!! Great fun!! With beautiful backgrounds and a timer, I'm still learning but enjoying the challenging levels and the HD quality.
0316228532|4.0|Who knew!  I loved this page-turner and feel like the folks I \\"met\\" in  Casual Vacancy are family and friends (friends?... well, you have to read it to understand!)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice app and all but everything is so expensive..... would be nice if it was a little easier to get items.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book! Definitely didn't expect the ending but really enjoyed it. Can't wait to see the movie :) c
B0095P29EG|5.0|beautiful picture I never go much to the movies so glad to watch it at home I would watch it again
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I was looking for a good book that would give insights into heaven,after life and near death experiences etc... I'm a person who experienced one of the greatest loss in my life as i lost my wife who was also a Doctor and experienced same steps as as Dr. Eben as she was unconscious for 3 days in an ICU. So, i wanted to see how she might have felt during that period and i guess this book was immensely helped me to understand that death is nothing but we just finish our job in this life. At last, i would recommend this book to anyone who needs to start searching for NDE stuffs.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|If you know of Sherlock Holmes from literature and not the 30s movies, this is a treat. Keep in mind the mindset of the British public of that era to anyone of color or foreign background.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I love this cd! Tedeshi has that bluesy soul of Janice joplin. Her voice is sexy and fresh. I'd like to see more of their own music instead of cover tunes. The guitar played by Trucks reminds me of the allman bros. Together they have the talent to go far and be up there with some of the best!  I think we'll be hearing a lot more from this band
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a classic love story of battered, dominated spouse with a delicious twist, it's a must read, there will be tears
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|this was the first movie I paid to see on amazon prime and I found it very interesting. A believable situation with a plane accident<br />and the many things that could happen during a rescue.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm so glad there is a Season II and beyond. This series is so well done and I was hooked after the first season. It's refreshing after not watching TV for many years because there is so little of value on these days. I wish there were more shows of this quality.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great book! This is a great way to learn more about  English language.I love this book so much.Great job Oxford university press.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a very touching story that always keeps you on your toes. I recommend this book to any Nicholas Sparks fan
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book! Read the entire book in a day. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
0062206281|3.0|I hesitated before writing this review, because unlike many other reviewers, I had not read Zafon's previous two books in this saga. However, because each book is billed as a stand-alone novel, I feel that this review could be helpful to those who are jumping in at this point in the series.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven has a lot of the elements I love in a novel -- a wonderful sense of place, haunting characters, a twisting and mysterious storyline.  But throughout the novel, I found myself feeling as though I was missing an important part of the puzzle.  There was not a lot of character development, although we discover essential details about Fermin's past.  While the plot was interesting, I felt like this whole novel was designed to set up the fourth book in the series.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Zafon's writing and am eager to read the previous two novels in the series. I typically don't read serial novels out of order (for obvious reasons), so my main disappointment was that this novel did not truly stand alone as the author claimed it would.  As a first-time reader of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series, I found several elements to be completely confusing, although I assume that readers of the other two novels would have had more context from which to work.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot speak for previous readers of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series.  If you're new to the series, this is not the stand-alone novel it claims to be.  I'm eager to discover the previous two books and fill in some of the questions this novel left for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game with nice graphics,and a good way to show kids how to take care of real animals. Can't think of anything to make it better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is a british gone with the wind and I love it. It is more in depth and shows more of the commoners side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great! i love this app its fun and entertaning. its very reasistic and alot like a real horse.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very well written, tapping into a broad range of emotion, some of which were very enjoyable, with plenty of anticipation, mystery, surprise, and suspense, which endeared myself to the main characters.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Sometimes I try to get on this and get advertising of the product about 5 times.  I don't know why that is happening
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Plenty of room for everything you would need to haul. Plus it just looks like a backpack, so it isn't as thief notifying as a traditional camera bag would be. Lays flat on the back to open and has all the little cubbies you need. Nicely padded straps and back.
B008N1LL42|2.0|Horrible painful juvenile script filled with mistakes. Inexcusable with a budget like this. Director must have not read it before shooting or else he's illiterate. I'm amazed someone actually got paid to write this rubbish. Watch it with the sound off and spare yourself the agony of horrendous dialogue, characters so dumb they should be in kindergarten, not running a Naval vessel, and plot development that was pointless and incoherent.
0345529057|5.0|The World created by George R. R. Martin is very big and very rich. The style in which each chapter corresponds to the viewpoint of a different character is new to me. And i like it very much. The story is complex, there are no classical bad guys and good guys. Read all three in record time and i am not an english speaker (as can be noted also in my writing). Excellent choice.
B00797MB0O|1.0|It's a waste of time. I don't like the story, nothing interesting, and it's just plain boring. The whole movie has no spark, no surprise, no climax.
B002RI9ORI|4.0|This book shows how those who work in the field or speak in the name of it can be manipulative. Scientific knowledge, as of any type of knowldge, can be missused and Ben Goldcare shows that brilliantly with homour.
B0080M3OGW|3.0|ummm... didn't seem very believable. kungnliu lkugboiug hnfr5bed utbtfiu ikgyofyi gjfdydtfj fdfygiuhu gffugih jggiug jghugu ukguigu huohg silly minimum word requirement
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I think this last movie falls neatly into the first 3 (I'm not counting Tokyo Drift).  And I can't wait for #6!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I wanted to watch a realistic movie instead of the loads of science fiction.  Denzel was good in his role, understated but not an award winning performance.  The story line about battling alcohol and drug addiction was the star of the movie.  It was a compelling story and the crash scene seemed very realistic.  I recommend it unless you have an attention span of typical teenagers, in which case I'd advise watching something different.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looper is a great original movie. A fresh concept in a time of remakes & reboots. Its Blade Runner, The Proffesional & Memento all combined.  A must see!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great show! After watching the final season I decided to start over again at the beginning and watch it all again.
0143112724|5.0|My roommate bought this for school. It came in great condition so she's very pleased with it. Thank you :)
B0035YTG30|5.0|I really like this classic. Light hearted from beginning to end. The lead female character is very pretty too hahah.
1400069289|5.0|I always wondered why stores especially big box stores do some of the things they do.  Now we know.  This book makes you stop and think about your habits both the good ones and the bad ones.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The transmission was terrific HD<br /><br />This is much better than the problems with Downton Abbey....  Where it is very inconsistent and frustrating
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The kids and I love to play this game. It's addictive like Granville is on Facebook. If you like horses then this game about taking care of them is for you.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|This series has the annoying habit of stuttering and stopping.  It can take a half our or so to get it back running properly.  It's very frustrating when this happens over and over again.  1 hour show easily becomes an all evening affair.
B003VBNN7C|5.0|This is an excellent movie with an amazing story and an ultra fantastic soundtrack!Violet followed her dreams and never gave up trying to acheive her goal as a songwriter!This movie shows you that you should go for your dreams no matter what anyone tells you...beleive in yourself...that's all you need!Everyone should see this movie because it makes you feel good:-)
B0053O89IS|2.0|This season set had no way to go to a specific program other than using the fast forward button and trying to find the beginning of a new show. I like to be able to re-watch specific shows, which is why I purchase the season sets. Seasons 1-6 all had the ability to select a specific program. I was surprised and VERY disappointed that this season did not. Although I enjoyed the programs, I will rarely watch this DVD set because of the inability to select the specific episodes. This will also be the last season set I purchase unless I know that this problem is corrected.
B003VW54QO|4.0|Classic film. Iconic stars.<br />One the good westerners.<br />Great role played by Dean Martin. John Wayne and Dean Martin duo excellent.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Just made sense I had to have the soundtrack! Just keep them coming. I'm country to the bone and love good country music!
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I loved it I know its a reboot but still fun good story and just a good time over all.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I don't even know where to begin, hard to pinpoint - the non-existent plot, the unrealistic sex, everything for sale....
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is a pretty sweet app. Takes all your social media like ESPN, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook etc and turns it into a magazine format. So you literally read your social media like you would any magazine. Enjoy it
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I have installed this on my kindle fire and at the beginning it worked just find. Now when I try to open it, it shuts itself off.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The only reason I have this four stars was because it's a little slow when you turn otherwise this game is great for all ages and very addicting if you liked this game then I would recommend subway surfers
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it's ok and if you can catch this in the first day or two (Feb 9-10) while it's at the $2.99 it's worth getting for an ok time waster. I wouldn't waste my money if you have to pay the higher price that g5 usually tacks on after the first 48 hrs.<br />  this was a shorter game (finished within an hour the first time through which included several distractions from the little kids). storyline was so boring I started skipping it after the first chapter. there didn't seem to be any glitches with gameplay except for the fact that the taps weren't always registered in the HO scenes. there were also a lot of objects in those scenes that were hidden behind the &quot;inventory&quot; button.<br />  if you enjoy these games more for the puzzles than for the HO games then you might want to skip this one. there were wry few puzzles and the ones that were there are way too easy to waste your time and money on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ROME!!!! I love it. The egg hunt gives you more of a challenge!I think you guys should do Paris next!!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|kept me intrigued whether she would finish.loved her strength. Loved the way her life ended. Made me want to visit Oregon
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower was an amazing book. Any teenager or anyone older would definitely love it too.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Just what I was looking for and at a great price. Arrived in time for Christmas viewing. Will watch again and again.
B005LAII80|2.0|It was nothing like I thought it would be. I wasted my money. I will think twice befor I order another DVD. I t was terrible.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I can't remember if this is fiction or non-fiction, but I'd love to believe it's a non-fiction story.  The pictures themselves make the book worth looking at!  Fascinating read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun<br />T his game is fun<br />This game is fun<br />This game is fun this game is fun
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was a god-send for me recently as I lost my  mom a few weeks back.  Reading Dr. Alexander's account of his &#34;death&#34; made the mourning for my mom a bit easier.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I needed a quick app to let me print from my [[ASIN:B00AB7FVCY Samsung Galaxy Note II]] to my [[ASIN:B0077FQ7PI HP Envy 111 e-All-in-One D411d Printer]]. This app did the trick quickly and easily.<br /><br />The download took mere seconds, and in less than a minute after installing it found my printer and I was printing to it. Doesn't get any easier than that.<br /><br />This app is supposed to work with any other printer, but I have not had the opportunity to test that out. As soon as I signed up for HP's printing service (also free) a long list of printers from local businesses like the UPS Store showed up, so this app, combined with that service, makes this ideal for road warriors.<br /><br />If you own an HP printer you cannot go wrong with this app. I am still smiling from the easy of installing and using it, which took place less than ten minutes before I was inspired to write this review.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Easy reading, couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Glad to learn how Cheryl's future played out.  Gutsy lady! Enjoyed
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. I know I'll be thinking about it for a long time to come. It made me smile, cry and laugh out loud at various points as I followed along with Jamie and Lydia's life experiences.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is written for married couples specifically, but the principles are applicable to all relationships. The book is insightful and makes the concepts easy to understand. The premise is simple and there are suggestions on how to apply the principles to your current relationships.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Interesting take on tv comic book adaption - strong cast that over comes sometimes predictable plot and over the top action scenes.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Cast gives standout performances. A truly original story that centers around the things which are truly life-affirming. I wish there was a genre for movies like this.
0143122010|5.0|1,955.  That's the number of footnotes in this incredible book. Pinker says the world is much safer than ever, and getting more so. Many people might reject that idea out of hand (&#34;What about nuclear weapons and terrorism and gun violence, etc.?&#34;) but Pinker gives us a boatload of evidence covering just about every domain you could identify.  The book was recommended to me by a scientist friend who used it as an example of a book that backed up its conclusions with data, and wasn't just someone's opinion.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|I've read a lot of Sci-Fi and i'd say this was pretty impressive. it was my first e-book so i'm still getting used to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've heard about Downton Abbey for a while now, but finally decided to watch a few episodes when the new season (3) came on.  I was immediately hooked, so I signed up for Amazon Prime and proceeded to spend the entire weekend and following week watching all of seasons 1, 2 and ALL of 3!!!  Yes, I paid for the British episodes that haven't premiered in the States yet because I couldn't wait!!!!  Best week of my life - and I got so much laundry folded and ironed!!!  Just wish it didn't have to end!!!
0143117130|4.0|The simultaneous failure and masterstroke of this book is, of course, the fact that Bridget Jones is everyone. It's a delightfully funny romp of a book; the pages turn quickly and the laughs come easily because every reader identifies with Bridget's misfortune and neuroticism. But the fact that most readers will identify with her means that she's probably not individualized enough--except in her case, with her zany ways, it's likely that she's too much of an individual, which paradoxically makes her an archetype. If that makes any sense...<br /><br />Really, though, this isn't the type of book where such a criticism matters. It's a book to be enjoyed quickly, in the brief moments where you're not, like Bridget, obsessing over your love life or career or appearance. I found it impressive that although many of these characters are frequently unlikeable (Bridget herself is horrible when her friend Tom \\"disappears\\"), they are all so easy to sympathize with.<br /><br />Although I haven't read much \\"chick-lit\\" and I also despise that term, I am willing to bet this is a highlight of the genre. For the most part, it's light and funny, but it also puts emphasis on significant current social issues, particularly those concerning the role of \\"modern\\" women. And for that reason, I expect Bridget Jones's Diary will, despite its fluffy exterior, go down in the literary annals because it quite accurately represents the major anxieties facing women in the beginning of the 21st century while managing to be witty and charming.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|If you like comic book action movies, this is the best one that has ever been produced. Can't wait for the sequel.
140053271X|5.0|eBoook is realy simple touch reader whith a correct price and very useful on day by day travel to my office.<br />It is exactly the device that I want.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It's defiantly a little creepy, but that made it all the better! I'd recommend to anyone looking for a good read! :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best Angrybirds yet! When you finish Tatoonie you unlock all the other worlds except path of the Jedi which is $1.99.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|THIS GAME IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE PLAYER. IT HAS MANY LEVELS WHICH CHALLENGES THE PLAYERS. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT HINTS BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PLAYER.
B003U4UPHG|2.0|I wanted to re-watch and see what I may have missed the first time. Sense November 2010 I turned off TV and have opened my eye's to the message behind all the programs. Boy have I learned. Stop watching could not take it anymore.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT IS USEABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS SHOW THE UPDATES AS QUICKLY AS I WOULD LIKE.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As a long time fan of Barker, King, Poe, Lovecraft, and McCammon I appreciate the larger scope of story arc this series has to offer. This is a very well-written and carefully crafted production that is character driven, not simply shock for the sake of shock. I would normally not be interested in the adult-themed aspect of a show but in this case I do not consider the sexual content to be gratuitous. This is a great show. I cannot recommend it to everyone, however; this is not a series for the squeamish or the faint of heart. I certainly had my share of nightmares during the series but as a &#34;confirmed ghost story and horror film addict&#34; it was well worth having to turn the lights on in the middle of the night. Bravo to the writers and producers, bravo.
B008M7JODC|5.0|One of the most original and thought provoking shows that I have seen in the last few years.  If you liked the X-Files and The Twilight Zone you will love this show.  Something new every week with great actors to boot!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|takes a very long time to load about 25-40 min but very very very fun its awesome I would highly recommend it to any body that likes angry birds
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|quality story; great acting; holds one's interest; credible and fun to watch.  Characters are interesting and present various and<br />unique circumstances.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|In my opinion, \\"learning to fly\\" is the best song in rock & roll history. The highs and lows of the beat render great power to the flow which seems to carry the listener to a high peak on which converging hard rock guitar and percussion meet with subtle melodious blues rythyms and firm standing vocals. Simply put, it's smooth and powerful. It's understated and reserved, yet reaches into ones being, syncronizing with the inner vibrations of our own vitality, lifting us to high places above our dreary places.  OK. To put it another way...IT'S PURTY DURN GOOD AND HEY, IT GIVES ME A THRILL!  and by the way, \\"ON THE TURNING AWAY\\" is an indictment of all who care about the poor but do nothing to help,  also presented with flair and verve. IN ALL, IT'S EASY LISTENING FROM START TO FINISH.
B000WN60NG|4.0|I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy a story with human interest and texture.  The movie has references to the culture of the Blues the history of race in the South and the simple humanity of people trying to find their way united by a desire to make music.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I like this series. I don't know how true it is to the real Sherlock Holmes characters, but these guys are good actors and play off each other well. I wouldn't recommend it to children under 13 due to subject matter. I don't remember any vulgarity but there were a couple of instances (of which I can't remember now) where my 13 year old asked &#34;What does that mean?&#34;, refering to something sexual I believe. I replyed with &#34;I'll tell you later.&#34; Later forgotten of course.
140053271X|5.0|Probably the best return for the price. It's very handy and comfortable, you can have as much books as you want just inserting a microSD card. You can have even some internet with Nook Simple Touch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this rating because this book was pure amazing. A love story, but still a tear wrenching novel. I loved it's deep tone, and quiet happiness. I would read it over and over if I could. But I don't enjoy crying my eyes out too many times.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love the classics.  This one is good for those nights when sleep does not come.  It shows what cruelty humans can show when they don't know Jesus as their Savior.
B009O07NDY|4.0|I have the three Lord of the Rings special edition CD 's. So I bought the extended version of the Hobbit rather than just the regular cd. I love Howard Shore 's compositions and  I wasn't disappointed even though I bought the CD before I saw the movie. This cd includes both &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; and &#34;Song of the Lonely Mountain&#34; (which plays as the credits roll).  The two songs I really wanted. I always hate it when I buy a CD only to find that it's missing some of the music or songs from the movie. &#34;Blunt the knives&#34;  Is also included. A fun song the dwarves sing around Bilbo's table. I rated it 4 stars because its not my favorite of the four films. I do so much love Richard  Armitage's deep voice as he sings &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; and the track &#34;Song of the Lonely Mountain&#34; but the rest of the CD is just better than nice.  Even with hindsight I'd still fork over the extra coin for the extended version.  I'm always sorry afterwards when I don't.
B0044IABFS|5.0|I can't believe I didn't watch this series when it aired. The writing is masterful and the acting superb. It was like a good book... I couldn't put it down!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've tried the other youtube apps but this is the only one that let me download the video to watch when I'm not connected to the web. When watching HD videos you can download them instead of streaming to avoid the buffering issues.  I've had no trouble running this app on either my original Kindle Fire or my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it uses my online profile which makes it easy.  You can download and stream in different resolutions. With this app you don' t need multiple youtube apps to do what you want. Watch, stream, download, manage account all in one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can't live without it! It is so addicting. I love temp run run 2
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but I can't play for very long on my Fire 8.9 without getting motion sick. I think that's hilarious. I've never had this problem with any game.  But that being said the graphics are much better and make harder to stay on track in Temple Run 2 than in Temple Run 1. The scenery is much more varied than the first. Love the mine tracks. Any get yourself a box of motion sick pills and download the game. I only took the star away cause I love this game BUT I can only play for a short time.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I gave this movie 5/5 stars because I had seen this movie once before and I wanted this movie to own.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I heard of it and put it on my want to see list.  Glad I did watch it.  It was even better than I thought it might be.  Far more in depth than I expected.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I gave the second season 5/5 stars because there was a twist with every episode and Damon had to make sure he could make Stepen mad every chance he could get.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|It is worth watching a second time.  I really should read Homer again, just to search for the different references.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I gave the third season 5/5 stars because it showed how Stephen really was and how nice and caring Damon could be if he really wanted to.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|The music (and opinions thereof) are well documented in the reviews here. Personally, I have always loved this album. It is a logical extension from Morrison Hotel but a bit more bluesy. The crowning bookends are the original LP side-enders LA Woman and Rider on the Storm. I am only posting this in terms of the vinyl re-issue. I am not sure if Amazon has it, but Analogue Productions has recently released the definitive master - 2 LPs at 45rpm on 200g vinyl. It is not cheap - I shelled out $50 - but the sound is so clean and pure there really is no comparison. Listen to the end of Riders and you will want to go outside and roll up your car windows. It is that good. So if vinyl is your choice, I am only offering this brief snippet to let anyone know a better option is available than the standard 180g.<br />Cheers
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I gave the first season 5/5 stars because the television show was nothing like the books. It was better. You had your little events that tied the show to the books, that was about it.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Long time fan of the series. I like the new doctor and the special effects have improved over the years
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Touching, real characters .. Really really liked it!<br />Matthew Quick isn't afraid to be real about life and present reality but still makes you love Pat Peoples and the other characters and root for them..
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Since Greg is so pathetic he makes all his books good, especially this one. I couldn't stop reading - literally.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|I hope that this unknown virus never comes to be. I thought about this movie for days after I watched it. That's probably what's meant to happen. It makes you want to apprreciate what you have now and not take it for granted.<br /><br />I also thought a lot about how I would handle the situations these people went through. One thing about people, though, they learn to adapt.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor was great in this movie, as always. I've recently been doing a marathon of his movies since I've discovered him in things other than Star Wars. He really is a versatile actor who goes all in with his characters.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's better than the 1st Temple Run. If you like the first one, then you won't regret purchasing this one.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|There were only two songs I didn't recognize, but I enjoy the entire album. I'm glad I picked this one up.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|oh this was the best movie i have seen in years.  it is a definate &#34;watch twice&#34; movie.  wonderful job on tommy lee jones, but then anything with him is well done.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|If you're a fan of the Matrix this is a must buy. It's very modestly priced and you get all four movies.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|It really picks up after the first few episodes. It turns in to a pretty entertaining show with a few awesome episodes. It can definitely pull you in and fix a craving for the DrWho-verse, just don't expect quite dr who level quality.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Amazing story that is hard to believe. It gives great insight in a culture different from the american way of living. Very sad but absolutely worth reading.
B00594XOZU|1.0|My daughter didn't like it at all, she was asked by friends to download it. She said it was confusing and not user friendly.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love how it sinks with my account now.<br />It's very smooth and I love how simply I can move around from item to item.
B004AQR24W|5.0|Good movie! Love it how I can watch it on my iPad! Can't wait for amazon to expand more and more of the movies that we prime members get for free!
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|it's a good back up...from your regular routine.  i use it on days I'm unable to make it to the gym
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good writing and acting. A good look at a period and lifestyles we are not that familiar with. Most of all, very well done.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This version of Emma has brilliant writing and a great cast.  It's thoroughly entertaining and one of the best Austen adaptations I've seen.
B005J2V74C|3.0|Overall, it was a good movie. I would categorize this movie in the list of movies to watch on DVD or streaming.
0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light is a very, very good conclusion to an incredible series.  It's not the best, and not my favorite book, but it brings the story to an ending in a phenomenal way.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Can't review because it does'nt run on my android tablet. Tablet uses android 4.01 so it seems it should work with this game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is one of the best apps i have ever downloaded!! i cant wait until they come out with #2 or they get new dragons. but dont bother buying any dragons with gold because you will probably breed them anyway
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so hard to put down!  I thought the first book was good, but this was even better!  It was filled with so much suspense and it was action packed.  I can't wait to start book 3!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Couldn't figure where it was going so it held me captive. I love Kate Morton. She never fails to deliver.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen!  It is definitely a soap opera; but with their British accents, you forget about that.  I just finished Season 1 and I have already ordered Season 3.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book is full of words...just. endless words and descriptions.  I lost interest very fast!  Kept hoping for more meat  to the story but just didn't come.
B0086213XW|4.0|I had avoided seeing this for several months, fearing it would be far too schmaltzy. Plus, I had a lot of trouble envisioning Seth Rogan in the role of Michelle Williams's character's husband. And if I had any quibbles with the movie, the first would be casting Rogan -- a seemingly nice guy, a sometimes funny guy, but more like the best friend and never the romantic lead. We didn't need that much contrast between him and the sultry Luke Kirby, whose gaze made me want to run off and earn my SAG card just so I could be in his next film.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is a better actress than she was in &#34;Brokeback Mountain,&#34; a maturity born of pain undoubtedly, tinged with grace and unmistakable lightness. She did a wonderful job of showing how a woman struggling in a marriage can be a &#34;good girl&#34; while all the while being so tempted by love and passion. Her emotions were perfectly played.<br /><br />So many terrific scenes in this film including a turn on an amusement park ride (Coney Island?) set to a delicious rock soundtrack. I won't spoil it.<br /><br />The ending is very disappointing and elements of tawdry sex besmirch an otherwise ethereal, lovely and romantic film.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best fantasy books I've ever read. The writing is engaging and the characters are compelling. I can not wait for the next book to come out.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I had seen this before, and somehow it affected me more when I was younger. Still, the director's mastery is shown by unique camera angles (to build tension) and locations. Where he seats his actors or has them stand is effective too, such as when Janet Leigh's character is looking up at Anthony Perkins when he's discussing his taxidermy. Obviously I enjoyed it more the first time since I didn't know what was going to happen. Now that I'm older, I can see this as a cautionary tale to always do the right thing. The shower scene so classic that viewers take it in and make it their own horrifying possibility...Score is appropriately suspenseful and actors are spot-on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|no problems and better than 1st one. full of ziplines upgrades characters and surprises. this game will make play for a long time and when your wqiting somewhere it will make you think temple run
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Very good.  My kids and I listen to it over and over in the car.  &#34;Stars&#34; is still my favorite song.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I like Christian Bale as Batman and the new series (the ones that he acts in) is in my mind the culmination of the Batman saga.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|What is not to love about these characters?  This is a great purchase and was loads of fun to watch
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is truly disturbing....but in a glued to your seat way. Kind of like a severe car crash.....you know it's horrible, but you cannot turn away...
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book starts off very slow and you are wondering why you are reading it.  The author sets up the stage to introduce these characters to you.  It is full of twists and turns..with an nail biting ending.  A must. read
0345803485|5.0|I loved the first one, even participated in a book club with friends over this book.  But about the middle of the second, I was tired of listening to how wonderful he was and how she couldn't believe he was hers and blah, blah, blah!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I never write reviews because I feel I judge too harshly but this book was great! It held my attention the whole time. This is my first read by Hoover but ive become an instant fan! The story breaks your heart but you cling to every word just waiting for the next revelation! Plus its well written unlike books Ive read recently about broken characters and the dire need for physical/ sexual dependency.
B006LQQ1GE|1.0|Aside from his one hit song the rest of the album falls so short! I end up skipping over the other songs. Sorry to those of you who are a fan!
B000FC10IO|5.0|This trilogy was great to read. Nix does a wonderful job staying true to the characters and develops them well. Each book is an exciting adventure and hard to put down!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It Sucked me in from page one. This is a great series. I can't wait to start the next book.

B001FAZYOQ|5.0|First, I just have to state the fact that I am a Bowie freak. I own every cd released by Ryko, have Au20 gold discs, rereleases, anniversary editions, some original RCA cds, and have over 40 original and rare cassette tapes and LPs, and still continue to collect cds and LPs of Bowie's extensive catalog. I have just (finally) bought this version of his Live Santa Monica recording from 1972, and am very satisfied with the quality of this now official bootleg recording. It is fantastic to be able to listen to and experience this moment in time from one of the greatest artists of our time, near his peak with his band at that time. It is a good recording. Loud enough... almost more than adequate. Raw... yes. Do you feel like you could be in the audience at the moment? ... yes. Are the musicians, including Bowie, performing adequate? ... yes. ----and no. I realize that this particular live recording is a sacred thing to a lot of fans, and it should be, seeing as to how little live recordings of this great period are really just that... GREAT live recordings of the era. However, it is still not better than the Ziggy Stardust Motion Picture soundtrack (at least the one, now remastered, by Tony Visconti). And let me briefly explain this... While this bootleg is a fine example of The Spiders live at their earlier stage of touring, the Motion Picture Soundtrack is just better in the fact that they have toured Ziggy, and found ways to improve upon their live performance. Not only is their performance, as a whole, on the Motion Picture Soundtrack (again... the version remastered by Visconti), a great improvement from this one, but also adds material from Aladdin Sane (of which is the tour for). The additions of Cracked Actor, Time, and Watch That Man are freakin' awesome... especially Time. Listen to that song and disagree, I dare you. Also the Stone's cover of Let's Spend The Night Together is also included, which is a sexually charged highlight as well. The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud/All The Young Dudes/Oh! You Pretty Things medley is a treat! Not to mention the 15 minute and 45 second long version of The Width Of A Circle. HOLY SH!T!!! is all I have to say! The guitar solo on that album is enough for the tipping of the scale in favor of the Motion Picture Soundtrack versus this Santa Monica performance. (And FYI... it includes the Clockwork Orange 'Ode To Joy' Intro).<br />Look... I am not saying for you to pass on owning this great recording at Santa Monica. No, I am just letting you know that the long cut-down Motion Picture Soundtrack is actually THE best ZIGGY experience... period. Better arrangements, better structure, more substance, and much more experience and confidence/cockiness. You can hear it in Bowie and the Spiders. You can actually picture him strutting around the stage like he rules the world. ....Better version of My Death as well. Just all around better than Santa Monica. And there's a lot more going on musically too. Plus, if you take into consideration, it too was recorded like a bootleg, you'd be hard pressed to say it is crappy, like others have continuously reported since its release. It is a shame that it has a bad rap, because to me, a lifelong Bowie fanatic, and lover of his Ziggy period, The Motion Picture Soundtrack is THE classic archive of that era. Period. Plus there is one annoyance (albeit an entertaining one) with Santa Monica that I cringe at. It is the part in Space Oddity after Bowie counts down, when you normally would hear the electric guitar make a climbing sound, he uses his voice instead to horrible, laughable effect. You'll know what I'm saying when you hear it. It is jarring and strange.<br />But, buy this Santa Monica album too. Really... buy it, because it is also good for a historical document, and a fun listen and addition to any fan's library. You decide. But DO NOT make the mistake of counting out the other (greater) live album of his Ziggy era. You'd be missing out on a true Ziggy Stardust concert experience at his peak... literally too, because it was his last show ever with The Spiders and as Ziggy. Just buy both, compare, and enjoy. You won't be disappointed with either album. I just wanted to make sure you experience the &#34;other&#34; Ziggy live album, because it is awesome. See for yourself. No b.s. ---from a fan.ncert experience at his peak... literally too, because it was his last show ever with The Spiders and as Ziggy. Just buy both, compare, and enjoy. You won't be disappointed with either album. I just wanted to make sure you experience the &#34;other&#34; Ziggy live album, because it is awesome. See for yourself. No b.s. ---from a fan.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I have memory problems, i got the app to see if it could make a difference.  I actually saw an improvement in only a week.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I got this so I could keep notes on important while on the road. I have been using it for about two weeks and have had it freeze up once.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Good read.  I liked the twists and turns. and the feelings of the sister who had not kept in touch as much as she wishes she had.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really liked the book. My daughter has it also and told me about it and knew I would like it. Bought it for my Kindle. Just bought the second book, hope it is as good.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was quite thought provoking.  The author makes you feel the angst the parents feel when their child is accused of a hideous crime.  Doesn't wrap up in a neat bow at the end either.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I gave this a 5 star as this was an excellant book.  I would definately reccomend this book to all my friends !
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|So much fun and super addicting!!! You'll be sad when it's over!!! Very creative and pretty brilliant!!! I can't wait for more games like it!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I purchased this book because it was a book club choice book.  I thought the book was gripping enough to keep turning the page but thought the two characters in this book were aweful people. I HATED the ending of this book and I am not sure I would reccomend this to anyone to read.
B004GYY714|5.0|Our local radio station dropped my favorite Jazz program so I searched for apps that would find my favorite DJ -- Bob Parlocha -- and allow me to listen to his Jazz programming.  This Tunein program did it!  I can find a station almost anytime of the day playing his Jazz music.  Clear and easy to use.  I'm so relieved and happy to find this terrific program.

B003PTP4S6|5.0|Beautiful compilation. Sound quality is superb. Great selection of songs for any mood and any activity in a day. Well worth every penny!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|When I got the DVD it was in top shape, no scratches or anything. No broken clips or f*ed up stuff. Very good!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I Really enjoyed the modern interpretation of the old classic Sherlock Holmes. Same old elements all new technology and gadgets.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Awesome, not one scratch or broken part. All in all, a wonderful purchase!! Would recommend it to anyone!! :D speedy service!!
B008SLAXGO|5.0|Only if you are a true fan you will love it. I bought it because I am a fanatic of this artist, you know, been to concerts, have all records, yes even those tracks that not even you do. And finally got this to see her, it is like if the pictures tell you an amazing story.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Super useful app. Quick and easy to understand and works every time. I would recommend this app.  I have the full version and love it.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|A very lengthy story...Not particularly believable....You must start off reading by having a mindset of &#34;This is fiction&#34;.  It is, however, a well thought out tale.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fast moving game.  This version is one to play when you want a quick mahjong game.  Very smooth tile movement.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Predictable...I saw this in the theater and left really disappointed esp after the build up which I just don't get.<br /><br />Seemed like many of the one dimensional action flicks you see rolled out these days with the exception of Daniel Craig and his talents. Take away Craig and the Bond brand and you have a direct to DVD flick.<br /><br />The villain put together an extremely elaborate plot just to meet his simple end game?! Why go through the bother?<br /><br />This will not go down in time as one of the better Bonds in my opinion.
B0098460O4|5.0|I love these two singers, both as people and performers.  I agree with some of the criticisms of the production quality -- there are imbalances in a number of places between the stars and the accompaniment.  But the thrills of their performances on BGT come through, at least for me, with more polish, too.<br /><br />Jonathan is the budding superstar here.  He is superior to Andrea Boccelli in the same songs. His voice is smoother, more mellifluous and more powerful than Boccelli's.<br /><br />For her part, Charlotte is quite professional, but she lacks the power that would come from more push from her diaphragm -- she sings too much from the head.  Still, as a pop/musical theater, she's quite good and has a future in that domain.<br /><br />As duo, they are very beautifully matched, and this album is very deeply moving to the point of bewitching.  I look forward to many years of them casting their spell!
0446581356|5.0|Great informative book! Really has taught me alot. I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about makeup.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really think this game is so much more awesome then the first temple run it is awesome and has better graphics
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting and story line in history simply magnificent . I believe you can sit through 3 episodes at at time which we did. The amazon watch now free for prime members a very big plus. We missed season 2 and couldn't get it through Netflix or anywhere else thanks to Amazon we were able to do the entire season two. It's great I would recommend it highly
B000002JPA|5.0|I was lost in the 70's and eighties when it came  to hard rock and metal music and I was fortunate enough to be turned on to Dream Theatre by a friend of mine close to 4 years ago. I was listening to this album for the first time ,when my best friend was fighting cancer and through prayer, positive thinking and the music of Dream Theatre, it helped carry me through the rough time. I might add that my friend beat cancer. Anyway, it's so refreshing to see such talented musicians as Dream Theatre create positive and such creative music that  isn't what I would call angry, aggressive heavier rock that is so popular today. Dream Theatre is right up there with my favorites such as Van Halen, UFO, Joe Satriani and Jimi Hendrix to name a few.  Pull Me Under, Another Day and Under A Glass Moon are my 3 favorite tracks on this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes hard, progressive virtuoso rock. You won't be disappointed.
B008M721MS|2.0|on my kindle fire hd. i cant hear the person im talking to,  even with my volume turned up all the way. &amp; the video lags constantly.  i wish this would work so  i can talk to my family.

B00BBDBB3A|5.0|I've purchased / downloaded several episodes of Castle Season 5. I discovered the show on TNT after the season had started. I was so intrigued by Beckett and Castle that I couldn't wait for the reruns to catch up on Season 5. It was definitely worth it because each of the episodes were fun - filled with banter, humor and sexual tension. Oh yeah, they solved a murder in each episode too.  I've been trying to get others hooked on Castle and hope this series runs for several more years.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a very cute story.  Enjoyed everything about it.  Was never bored.  Kept me wanting more all the way through
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Somebody told me I should drop everything and read this book.  After looking at all the good reviews online it looked like my  type of book.  Let me preface by saying I love me some good scifi fantasy cyberpunk novels,...huge fan of neal stephenson's &#34;snowcrash.&#34;<br /><br />The books starts off real strong but quickly devolves into constant beyond nerdy D&D/80's pop refs.  It reads like a very thinly developed young children's novel.  I'm not the type to not finish a book, but..after half way through, I didn't see the point.  Obviously many people disagree with me, but feel free to give it a shot and see for yourself.
B00992CF6W|4.0|completely epic except the difficulty it takes to get to the nether and how you can change it from creative to survival but I've played all versions and each one is completely awesome
0671027344|3.0|HATE THIS BOOK BUT U MIGHT LIKE IT IT WAS CHEAP AND IT WAS FOR SCHOOL SO I GUESS ITS OK
B007V65R54|5.0|We often hear about polls and the results of those polls. We here about predictions with such authority and conviction, it is hard not to believe them as fact,  One might come to the conclusion that they are accurate representations of public opinion and scientific facts that have been uncovered and proven without a doubt through a rigorous process..  Then along comes Nate Silver, an individual who has simplified and dissected statistical inference so that it reads more like a novel than a textbook.  He demonstrates the ability to separate the wheat from the chaff, to truly get at the dependencies in the data.  Nate illuminates biases in data and clearly articulates why practitioners present it in such a fashion.  He brilliantly weaves the match concepts and real world implications, after reading this book I truly believe I have a better understanding of modeling and predictions along dimensions seldom explored.  He even dissects how Big Blue took down a master.  Nate accurately predicted the 2012 election to an unprecedented level.<br /><br />Awesome read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending book in the trilogy of the hunger games<br />Can hardly wait for the next movie<br />Coming this fall
B0049VZ222|5.0|The Walking Dead is the Best damn show in Years!! My family and I can't get enough of it!! Awesome, Awesome, A+++!!! Thank God Amazon Instant Prime has it, because we don't have regular T.V.!! This show Rocks!!!! Thanks Amazon!! Yours truly--- Jessica R.
B008Y6WPXC|4.0|Just a good action filled movie.Has some of the best action stars in movies now and in the past.Special effects were very good.i would have given it 5 stars but it's the same old good guys against bad guys an as always the good guys win.I would recommend this movie for any age group!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Wonderful and can't put down  Will read her others holds your in interest all though highly recommended for a real suspenseful story
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Typical story line for another MIP.Lots of special effects and very good action at times.Not as good as the first two but still entertaining.Would recommend it for the ages 12 and above.
B00B7XGFO4|5.0|Well acted version of a classic.  Worth watching.  We enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to anyone.  George C. is great as usual
B0095P33IW|4.0|It's worthy of the four stars because of the special effects and the action.Good storyline of the weak becoming strong and battling evil.Did a good job on the costumes for that era.I would recommend it for 12 years old and above.
B0093ST02E|4.0|It kept me entertained throughout the movie.  I  liked the actors  so that was a plus!  Definitively would recommend it!
B000WN60NG|5.0|OK; so Ralph is not a believable visual as a bluesman.....but the spirit is on point.  Being a musician from Memphis and playing all over for 24 years, I can tell you there is many solid truths in this movie.  Joe Seneca is great as Willie Brown. You can feel the heat and humidity when he is standing on the highway to Greenville waiting for Lightning to tie his Mississippi string tie.<br /><br />You get a taste of early Steve Vai as Jack Butler, a white boy from Memphis that cuts heads (guitar contest) every Saturday night.  I loved the scene with Robert Judd as the Devil.  Loved his clothes and the cadence in his vocal delivery.  Many good locations in this move and the feel of the deep south in the 80's is just like I remember.<br /><br />Grab your half-pint of Old Crow, strap on the pignose and plug in your beat up guitar you been squeakin' on and find ol legbuh out on the crossroads.
B007N85POS|1.0|It's always asking me to buy power-ups, which are expensive.  I can never get beyond the first level.  Boo to  this!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Super boring. Terrible transitions between chapters. Next to no action in first half of book. A very, VERY disappointing read! If Rowling submitted this book as an  unknown author, I doubt if an agent or editor would have taken it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|good app that has a nice interface. I like the weather feature. very happy with this one, as my phone alarm was becoming unreliable. the upgrade version would be nice, I could live without the ads, but the free version has all the functionality you really need.

B001UW58WW|5.0|David Garrett's music is addictive!  It doesn't matter if it's classical or rock, or a mix of both it's some of the best violin music I've heard. He also has a DVD of his live concert available and it's so much fun to watch him play because his personality (not to mention his good looks) really shine.  This was the first of his CDs I purchased and it didn't take long to buy more.  I know some of this is cover music but he's a wonderful composer and he really makes these songs his own with his unique style.  Some of the pieces we've all heard before, Nothing Else Matters, Who Wants to Live Forever, Air and a few more, but done in his unique style, with the passion and emotion he shows/plays with, it makes them sound new, like you've never heard them before.  Check out some of his other music CDs and his DVD.  I think if you like this CD you'll want more of his music.

B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is an excellent series that is absolutely engrossing.  We watched both seasons in less than 10 days.  Can't wait for the next season to begin.<br /><br />This was an excellent price for this item - good value.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book because  it was really funny and cool and silly and crazy I just can't explain the craziness. I hope I get to read more books just like this one.__@ mpbyrd1982@yahoo.com.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was totally addicted to the first one, until I got other apps, and forgot about it. I guess I'm starting all over again! It is so fun, and even though the part where ur riding in the cart/ train thing is hard, it is really thrilling! Love it.&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;  I even gave it five hearts, aside from the fact I also gave it five stars! :-)
B000000XB9|5.0|My Husband loves Chronicle  Creedence Clear water so I got it for he for a Christmas Gift.I also love this tape.

B00A83075M|5.0|This movie is what is about to take place on planet earth. He who has ears let them hear what the Lord says.<br /><br /> 1Th 4:13 ¶ But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.<br /><br /> 1Th 4:14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<br /><br /> Mat 25:1 ¶ Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br /><br /> Mat 25:2  And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.<br /><br /> Mat 25:3  They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<br /><br /> Mat 25:4  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br /><br /> Mat 25:5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<br /><br /> Mat 25:6  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<br /><br /> Mat 25:7  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<br /><br /> Mat 25:8  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<br />Rev 9:2  And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.<br /><br /> Rev 9:3  And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.<br /><br /> Rev 9:4  And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.<br /><br /> Rev 9:5  And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.<br /><br /> Rev 9:6  And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br /><br /> Rev 9:7  And the shapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces [were] as the faces of men.<br /><br /> Rev 9:8  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions.<br /><br /> Rev 9:9  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.<br /><br /> Rev 9:10  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Glad to see they lived a happy life even more happy to read Mr Grey was finally able to find true happiness after all he had to endure in his life time growing up.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Kept my interest, well written, would recommend it.  Read this book for my book club, should be an interesting discussion
B007PVHMCG|4.0|As someone who's just starting to get back into LEGO, this set hits all the right notes for me. Appeal to an awesome game, check. Lots of pieces not normally included in other sets, check. Modular and easy to display on my desk, check.<br /><br />I like the set because it's modular and can be quickly rebuilt to make your own scenes. I also like the flat 1x1 plates - but there sure are a lot of them. As far as set weights go, this is pretty light. Lots of tiny pieces could pose an issue for younger builders. I built my first set in an hour, and my second in 45 minutes, but I could see build times easily doubling mine depending on age. Kids obviously love it, and for parents it can be frustrating to see your kids want something that doesn't maximize pieces/dollar/gram ratios, but there's a good econ lesson in there. Especially if you can work something in about scalpers and aftermarket pricing. A note on that - don't pay their ludicrous prices. Keep an eye out and you can snag this set fairly easily. SlickDeals always has a thread posted when this set is in stock.
B000GOVHN4|5.0|For whatever reason, I anticipated I wouldn't like this movie. SO wrong! It was incredibly funny and heartwarming. Elijah Wood is perfect as the Collector.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story line and acting are simply superb. This series has been a joy to watch and I look forward to every new episode.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I Like Nelson DeMille's style.  As usual well written, suspenseful, funny, and a good story.  Kept me turning pages late into the night.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I've only watched the eposodes, none of the speical features but if you haven't seen the HIMYM seasons defintely check it out. Each eposode kind of fills you in out what is going on so you won't feel lost just watching a random one. RDE
B003O86FMW|4.0|loved the twist, cannot wait to read the next book.  would definitely recommend this book to friends and family members.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I've only watched the eposodes, none of the speical features but if you haven't seen the HIMYM seasons defintely check it out. Each eposode kind of fills you in out what is going on so you won't feel lost just watching a random one. RDE
B0014H32MG|5.0|It is Stephen King, is there any doubt that this would be a good book. He has yet to disappoint. Nothing like the movie with Arnold.
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this moveie the first time I saw it...had the have the DVD. It is definately a keeper lol.
0385040253|4.0|Overall I like this book a lot, it is comprehensive and has an unexpected charm.  It didn't give it 5 stars because it feels slightly low quality and I note that the text margin at the channel (the bound edge of the page) is rather uncomfortably small.  Notwithstanding these comments, I strongly  recommend this book to all knot &#34;tyers&#34; .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It brought tears to eyes. Every person in this world deserves love that amazing and intense. It was like I felt every emotion they were feeling. Out of all the books I have ever read this one is my favorite. It's a book that you could read over and over and not get tired of it.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I chose this rating because I got exactly what I wanted at the indicated arrival time. Great service and recommend it to anyone.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|It's a fun and challenging game that me and my kids like to play when there is nothing better to do
B007C7UZIG|1.0|This app is no good it dose not snyc with the steam app for the pc infact you have to create a whole new account for this app to even work. for me
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Twist on original version, which makes it more challenging and fun to play when there is nothing else to do
B005PK56TA|5.0|What a great show that's even better watching with no commercials!!  I'm so glad this is available for streaming on amazon!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Okay so I just downloaded the game today and it won't let me play it at first!!! But it let me play latter on and it is REALLY a fun game and I rely enjoyed it:)
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|As stated above, it was a decent movie if you just want violence. But as far as batman movies go this one really dropped the ball.<br />One of my least favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game!I compete with my friends all the time from Facebook and tell people at school. I love this game so much. :-)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Can't get temperature out of Celcius (even after changing in options) and can't change from millimetres to inches for rain/snowfall.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like coin dozer but I did not see any instrution on how to play the game.<br />It's alot of fun, does not make the coins come out fast enough for me.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This case is very good.  Hence, 4 stars. Nothing more to say, really, but they need some number of words so I can submit this.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Exciting and very well written.Mitch Rapp  is in the league with Jack Reacher  as macho folk hero..This is greaat literary finger food.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved it and it's amazing.I think I'll be playing this game for a long time .<br />Also I can't wait until the next upgrade because it's gonna be very exciting.
B008OE05IG|5.0|A look inside the world of a first class sushi chef!<br />The daily routine, trips to the fish market, and his relationship with his two sons are not to be missed.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book especially near the end of the book :) it took a little time to get into it. When I got half way through I couldn't let my kindle down
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My daughter wanted to see this movie. I wasn't familiar with it so I did not expect much. However, it was humorous and entertaining. I enjoyed watching it whit her.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It am deeply in love with this game! A new Update!!!! 6.1.  Hold on a sheep with some kinda dye, and the sheep will turn that color. Also go to options and turn on 'fancy graphics' and you'll see clouds. Can't stand on them yet, but still cool, right? Armor is available now, too. People that don't play minecraft: you must play. It is an active building game that simulates blocks and allows you to play creative or survival. A cool game is waiting. Note: Bugs. Do not dig all the way down. You will never get out again. Don't say I didn't warn you. Hoping they add more stuff like blocks and mobs.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|The game is a fun version of a hidden object game with levels of different type puzzles.  But the dialogue flows is a little long and I found myself tapping through it and missing game instructions.  Plus if you zoom in, it reads extra taps when you move around. Other than that, I thought the game was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this all the time so I'd thought I should rate it, my horse game should include more complex jumps though... and maybe more racing...
0393064476|5.0|Heard this author in a televised interview and was fascinated by the subject matter.  Took it with me while my husband and I were on vacation and kept stopping him while he was fishing to read aloud from the book.  We both loved it.  Subsequently bought the Lucretius, which we also both enjoyed reading.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I'm a sucker fro period dramas and Lark Rise to Candleford did not disappoint! Great cast with a ton of great stories!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This app does everything it says it will do, what I like about it is that it keeps sync on my kindle, desktop and laptop. Very functional. Any cons ....? well if it could be in color would be nice, the ability to use different fonts would be nice! But overall a great program.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|At first this had great possibilities. After the first level the number of points to be reached increased but the fun did not. Very unremarkable.
B00821OX98|1.0|Poor writing, poorly acted. The typical modernday American style tripe where everyone behaves like an emotional little girl. It took 3 attempts for me to be able to finish the first part of the pilot. I'm actually not sure if I finished the second part, but I just don't care, it is garbage.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|good series I cant believe I never saw it on TV a must see for syfy and x file fans
B0081336FO|5.0|The BBC version of contemporary Sherlock Holmes is a real winner. Superb acting, witty and intelligent scripts- I have watched every episode of both seasons 1 and 2 more than once, and thoroughly enjoy it every time. I can't wait for season 3.<br />Brilliant!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Gotta love Walter. He is quite a character. And Anna Torv is an excellent actress, not to mention very attractive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its awesome.I love it. I'm going to go play it now ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hays
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Was wondering how the author was going to keep the reader from jumping right to the operation, but there was some great background info.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Nice way to catch up on missed shows.  I definitely will be using this method to catch up on all that I have not watched. Thank<br />you for offering this service.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|The book is much better than the movie. I've been a huge fan of the movies all my life..Not until recently I began reading the books and I wished I would've started off with them. Great read
B0080MJYR0|1.0|They all should have failed that class.  Looking for a camp si-fi movie and felt assalted by bad script and acting.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Through the mighty powers of related suggestions on my Kindle, I discovered How to Be a Woman, or at least I discovered the book and not the answer. My Kindle is usually pretty good with suggestions, and it was right about this one, as well.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book as long as I don't pick apart each chapter. There were some chapters that I liked more than others, and a couple of chapters I didn't like at all. Admittedly, I skimmed or skipped through the couple of chapters that didn't do much for me, such as the chapter on Abortion and Role Models. Her views on Abortion don't match mine, and while I respect that we are both allowed to have different views, I felt like she was \\"poking fun\\" at people who don't have her same view. The Role Models chapter seemed to be there to solely put into words her high disdain for Katie Price.<br /><br />With those two chapters out and a few soapbox moments in some other chapters, the book was pretty spot on for what I enjoy reading in a book about what women like and really bonded with Caitlin through her words. Caitlin is a mother and has a chapter on being a mother, followed by a really awesome chapter on why women shouldn't feel that they have to be mothers. Being a Not Mom myself, I gained tremendous respect for Caitlin for addressing the issue and pointing out that women who are childless (by choice or not) are not less of a woman. Caitlin was truly and properly speaking for me as a childfree woman by saying things like, \\"But deciding not to have children is a very, very hard decision for a woman to make: the atmosphere is worryingly inconducive to saying, \\"I choose not to,\\" or \\"It all sounds a bit vile, tbh.\\" We call these women \\"selfish.\\" The inference of the word \\"childless\\" is negative: one of lack, and loss. We think of nonmothers as rangy lone wolves--rattling around, as dangerous as teenage boys or men. We make women feel that their narrative has ground to a halt in their thirties if they don't \\"finish things\\" properly and have children.\\"<br /><br />Caitlin presents herself well as this woman that most women would enjoy spending time with. She's like an 'every woman' representative for women who aren't and never have been perfect and perhaps identify closely with their weird side.<br /><br />How to Be a Woman is recommended for people who lean more left than right and understand that there are way too many facets of womanhood to attempt to explain fully in a novel. However, reading this book can help you gain a better understanding of why you are who you are and why society views you in certain ways.ngs\\" properly and have children.\\"<br /><br />Caitlin presents herself well as this woman that most women would enjoy spending time with.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautiful writing, handling sensitive material so well that I thought I was reading a mystery and yet the plot was not predictable.  Loved the characters
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Honest, sincere, tough, cathartic.  An easy book to read.  A gripping story.  I enjoyed having two perspectives.  I appreciate Chris's insights and perspective, his straightforward honesty.
B000YJ6736|2.0|Too much description that leads to the climax of the story at the end of the book.  I know the climax was to be shocking which it was but it was also very disappointing.  What a waste of time!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The Blue ray-DVD combo pack with ultraviolet and amazon digital copy is worth so much more then what you pay. Then you are enjoying the movie ( which is hilarious) everywhere :)
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is good, but it does not always save. It is a lot better than the first one though because it lets you chose your levels. Overall I am impressed
B00371QQ2U|1.0|Don't bother with this version.  Universal completely screwed this one up,<br /> by the time you finally get though the menu to the movie you'll be to aggravated to watch.<br />also when you finally get to the movie you have no real control over back, fast forward and stop.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It&#34;s fun but is so predictable, like when you get the long zip line you get only 86 coins and the short zip line you get 36 coins.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a perfect distraction from daily life.<br />The cast and story lines are fun and endearing .<br />Always making one wanting just one more<br />epispde!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! I am giving it the highest rating I can because it was so romantic. The characters were perfect for each other. M's. Kelly kept me so enthralled in the story there was no way I could put this book down.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a book written about one man's experience in an Catholic orphanage (Ireland, if I am remembering correctly), It is written in a past/present narrative that is easy to follow.  I thought the author did a very good job of painting a verbal picture of the pain and everlasting heartaches that followed many orphans who had the terrible misfortune of finding themselves in such places.  However, the book has places of moral high-ground and optimism.  It is a good read.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|There were some interesting concepts, and potential storyline, but none of them came to fruition.  A long movie without good plot or character development.  Disappointing.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|So much of our lives are lived through sheer habit-and it isn't something many of us take notice of.  This book describes how we can get stuck in self-destructive ruts, and gives suggestions on ways to re-wire our thoughts and habits.
B00338QENI|4.0|Beautifully written saga by mixing medical advancement with deep family feeling. Provokes  a personal gut-level response from the reader. Great read!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|HD playback throughout the movie (we do have a cable modem though). The price was perfect FREE with my Prime membership (which I bought for free 2 day shipping, Now if I can just get the shipping to work as well as the video service.)
B0026S93C0|5.0|Great music beautiful actress good storyline. and single girl with beautiful pit like me;)  great oldie that i can watch over and over
B008N9AASC|1.0|Samsara stinks!  It is nothing more than an exercise in photography.  Boring junk,  with funeral music. Do not buy this.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|This is what I would expect from these two on a Saturday night on Charlie's front porch.  Spare, soulful, moving.  Yep, no doubt, &#34;She Got Kick!&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Worth the fuss!<br />Great character development. The only problem is, these episodes are like potato chips. \\"No one can eat just one!\\"<br />It's quite challenging to limit oneself to a single episode.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I like this movie is very funny and creative. Great job by Johnny Depp. No interruptions during the stream play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome it is fun the horses actually look real it is fun awesome amazing you can buy different horses
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was not taken with this novel and do not know why it has received so much attention. The people are really messed up and the ending is not only improbably, but a terrible one for all but especially for the child.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As always, five stars for Kathy Reich's. Just when I wonder if she will run out of plots for Temperance, she nails another one with even more suspense and a touch of heartfelt humor. Please keep them coming.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Money talks, but when you are able to light your drinking water on FIRE, it's time to realize that no amount of money is worth the ultimate contamination of the Earth. The temptation to feel that we can sustain our energy consumption without importing from other countries is highly attractive and patriotic, yet tracking will cause us more harm than good in the long run.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows ever ... it's beautiful and the characters just draw you in. Love it, highly recommend it.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|This is a fantastic throwback (modern) 70's flick.  This means fairly violent, decent action, very little nuance in the plot, and very little dialogue (only to move the story forward).  For the most part there are no surprises because characters act the way you'd suspect they would act; also there is no real \\"good guy\\" in this movie.<br /><br />It's a great movie if you're into these kinds of movies and can deal with a modern \\"gloss\\" (as in it looks (is filmed) better than 70's movies of the same genre).  This isn't art it's a popcorn flick.  There are lots of these types of movies being made currently (most of which are awful) however, this is great because it maintains the spirit of the genre.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Needs some way to rate my books and authors.  Easy to use and download.  Great feature in view options.  Just need rating to help review what we have purchased.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The storey flowed well and kept me interested throughout the book.  I think it is better geared to under 35's (younger than me!), having said that, it is well written and covers subjects that are not for the immature.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started watching because I love Joshua Jackson, kept watching because I loved the rest of the cast, infinitely freaky story lines, and crazy twists and turns. Quickly addicted!
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Just a blockbuster of an old classic with John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles and Lee Marvin. Have watched it dozens of times. It just gets better each time!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and love it.  I find it relaxing to just pick it up and play for a while to clear my mind.  I particularly like having it while waiting anywhere I need to pass the time.
B0083Z614S|5.0|For fun. A fantasy land in the garden of your heart with a moral lesson tucked up it's sleeve, bursting with imagination.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Nice book. Enjoyed it very much. So many untold stories .  I am glad they were able to meet and have a friendship
B004XUMMFE|4.0|There was only one season to enjoy! The show was cancelled to soon for something worthwhile! If Star Wars can resurface then Firefly can catch fire again!
B000LB7G00|4.0|It would be good if  the software was a bit more full featured on OSX to enable use accros more apps.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have found this series to be such a wonderful read I couldn't pit it down. It catches you in, and keeps you wanting more!
0525953728|5.0|I found this to be an action packed account of a real mission by Navy Seals.  I could not put it down.  Thank God for men and women in our Armed Forces who are willing to do these missions to keep America safe.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Keeps you engaged... loved the series.  Plan on reading them all.  Would highly recommend to everyone especially for the great price!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|What an excellent show. My husband and I stay up until the wee hours to watch \\"just one more episode\\". Compelling characters that you love or despise. Story lines that keep you guessing. One of our favorite shows ever.
B008L1F91A|5.0|Very happy with this product as the detail is excellent and quality is as well.  I do wish the foot magnets were a little stronger, but I'll have it placed in a safe area anyway and it shouldn't fall over.  I'll most likely buy more of this brand of figurine for myself and son over time because of the quality. g-
B001XUT6AG|4.0|Not the worst and definitely not the best in the classic Star Trek movie series but it's a good one to watch every couple of years if you are a fan. A must see for Star Trek fans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I  personally enjoyed these books so much! I think that more could have been added, and less repeating but still amazing
B00006GA4C|5.0|This is a great album at the time, I remember listing to too back in the 70's when my older brother would let me borrow it from time to time,back then it was on vinyl or cassette.The sound on this CD is fantastic,Your going to need a great subwoofer and speakers and if you have all that. Just crank it up and enjoy.One of the best albums Grand Funk has put out.I highly recommend this CD.I thought I would never find it in publication. Thanks to the seller.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I enjoy this movie whether it is on TV or the DVD. Whenever on TV, I always stop to watch it for whatever reason. Think I have seen this movie well over 50+ times I just enjoy it. Amazon delivered this movie and others ifaster than expected.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Liked this one. Different take on things - interesting the way the story unfolds. Dark and engaging generally. But a very easy read. Enjoyed it!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Don't give up after the pilot, which has the  typical alien-invasion plot. After that, it became the best TV series I have followed in 20 years.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|A Scottish tale of mystery - the first in a trilogy. Well worth a read. So great when you start a trilogy and you like the first book - you still have 2 more to read!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Incredible footage, incomparable music. Has to be one of the best DVD's ever! The pure blues sex from R. Plant, guitar genious from Page, the bass line of JPJ and of course the most powerful drummer Bonzo.
B009NH9IMM|5.0|Just amazing! Highly recomended. If you like horror movies this one is the right one for you. Buy it now
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this! I got to 3 million on it and have never gotten to a million on the 1st. its great and I love the graphics!
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Just amazing! Highly recomended. Mi little boy love the movie. The shipping was extremely fast and the item arrive in perfect condition. I´m happy with this purchase.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Still a classic, and with Amazon streaming in HD with the 5.1 Dolby, why not kick back for a couple of hours?
B00821OX98|5.0|cant wait for the next season. will keep you on the edge of your seat. need more survival type series.
B007QDNKQA|1.0|This movie is lame, uninspired, woodenly acted, and poorly written. i would give it no stars except the production values are marginal.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|best batman animated film since the redhood classic. this is for a much more mature audience. batman don't play around in here, this film proves his O.G. status.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Great construction, color and design. Would buy many others and would recommend them unhesitatingly to my friends and family members.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book Hopeless.  The beginning was a bit slow, but as soon as Holden came into the picture the book became more interesting.  Love the plot to the story.  Worth reading!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I ordered this product for my Ipad and was impressed at how I received it immediately.  I will continue to order books for my ipad via Amazon. Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It drew me in from beginning to the end! I couldn't put it down. It was a great ending with great characters.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall a very fun game. Sometimes freezes up or won't open. A lot to do and a very entertaining game.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I didn't realize this was a group sort of thing. I thought it was going to be a game like Angry Birds. I'll be more careful in the future of purchases.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a hooked Michael Connelly consumer.  In particular, his characters are so artfully drawn that I feel I know each of them - Harry Bosch, Rachael Walling, David Chu etc. The only other writer with whom I am familiar is Steven Coonts.  Both Coonts and Connelly are in a league of their own.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was very similar to other fantasy books. The words mundane and muggle sound very similar and mean the same thing. There were a few plot points that don't make sense. The tone seems very similar to twilight but it has an actual interesting protagonist. The story was entertaining but predictable at times. Overall though City of Bones was a novel that kept me entertained and wanting to read more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns ...definately a very good read .. I Loved how Flynn took you chapter by chapter !!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Watching the relationship unfold between these two was facinating!  I fell in love with both of them :)  Watching their love-story unfold was highly addictive!!!!  GREAT book!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I have always liked this movie. Great special effects and action from beginning to end.  Never get tired of the liquid metal man!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved seeing how this concluded!  This took a book that some may view as risque and closed the loop on that!  GREAT book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never review anything but cannot bypass an opportunity to sing the praises of this book.  I stopped everything that I was doing to read it and thoroughly enjoyed every page.  I highly recommend!!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Cute game just like Mario bros that we all loved.  Graphics aren't bad.  Haven't played it as much as doodle jump but it's cool just the same!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless grabbed my attention as soon as I started reading.  This book has it all!  I will watch for other books by this author.  Enjoy!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was one of those that you find yourself still thinking about days after you have viewed it. Unfortunately, if it doesnt have sex, violence, or special effects...movies like this dont always get recognized for the great artist work that they truly are, perhaps because you have to use your mind and soul to watch it. Great cast and screenplay, cant wait for it to come out on dvd!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. On 3d it was even better. I would definitely recommend this movie for everybody. It is really funny, and has a great storyline.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy ::&)&!!!<br /><br />This book was amazing.<br /><br />I'm actually sitting here just overwhelmed by it quite honestly. It was just that good. The plot takes these just crazy twists that were totally unanticipated.  I don't feel like I cab say much more without giving things away. What I will say is that you will really get into this book. I feel like it started out slow so stick with it because once it takes off, it takes OFF!!!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a delightful series. The characters are endearing and the stories transport you to a sweet, simpler time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great time waster. Enjoyable and I'd recommend it. Very easy to play and loads quickly.  Never seems to grow old.
B004RE29PO|5.0|Where ALIEN was sci/fi horror, James Cameron takes us into new territory by going the action/thriller route yet still remains respectful and faithful to all that was established in the previous film.  ALIENS in a perfect example of how a sequel should be made.  This movie has it all, top notch special effects, a thrilling story that never lets up once it kicks into high gear, and beautifully fleshed out cast of characters.<br /><br />Fifty seven years after her horrible ordeal in ALIEN, Ellen Ripley is rescued from deep cryo-sleep by a salvage crew and sent back to a station near Earths orbit.  She is grilled by company brass for the loss of her crew and ship from the previous film and demoted from her flight officer status.  Ripley soon learns that a colony has been established on the planet where the alien creature that killed her crew came from.  Soon contact is lost with the colony and the company wants Ripley to go in with a military team to check on the operation.  When Ripley and the marines arrive they discover that the colony is missing and that there are not one, but a whole nest full of alien creatures.  The might and firepower of the marines is outmatched by the resourceful aliens.  Ripley and a handful of survivors must struggle to survive and wipe out the alien onslaught before they can return to Earth.<br /><br />If you are a fan of ALIEN then you will love ALIENS.  It is every bit as good as the original which is rare for a sequel.  Sadly this is the last decent film in the franchise.  ALIEN 3 and 4 just don't measure up and should never have been made.  I wish James Cameron would revisit this franchise and set things right with a proper follow up to ALIENS.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|I love these two actors and I watch most of their movies.  This movie has some funny scenes but all in all falls a little short.  The acting is great as you would expect but the story was not up to the same level.  Take it or leave it, there are better movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the beginning I thought I knew where the story was headed. To my surprise, the story took different turns. The thoughts of the characters and actions between them are very well written. There were no loose ends. The story is fun, sad, hopeful, anger and love all combined.
B004X4R3FE|5.0|This is a great movie and I would highly recommend it for anyone!  It is based on a true story and the acting and characters are very well done.  I have watched this several times and each time it is just as good as the last.  What more can I say, watch it!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love all of the puzzles.  It gives you easy ones to start and you work your way up. Really good to keep an active brain.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I like Willis movies even though they are usually way over the top.  However, this movie is brutal and violent.  I stopped watching it when he was about to kill a small child.  Terminator one was pretty violent but this was just bad.  I would not recommend it even as an action movie!!  Two thumbs down!!
0596805888|5.0|My son was happy to receive this.  It was on his gift list.  I'm sure his wife will like to have him cook more.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for a guy to buy an expensive DVD box set, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of discs; episodes that have been acquired over a very long series. Discs that will be a joy for people like you. If you let pass on buying this box set now, that'll be the end of it. It will not look for you, it will not pursue you. But if you do buy this box set, it will look for you, it will find you, and it will entertain you.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|whats to say have loved big fish games for years. they are challenging and very interesting to play. this was no exception.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This movie combines two of my absolute favorite things, Anime and Daft Punk. The animation works beautifully with the music and in my opinion it's just incredible. There isn't anything negative that could be said about this movie. There is no dialog, but the music and animation work together to bring out the story.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Great movie. Shia LeBouf is kinda played out though. Too serious as Mr. Witwicke now, chill the heck out. Would have been better if he hadn't overacted
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Absolutely, love, love, love this CD.  Have loved Rod since he came out with my fav song of all time, Maggie May!  Beautiful Holiday CD!
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|I have it on my Kindle fire but don't know exactly what it's used for, so it will take up space until I figure it out.
B007SGM084|5.0|I own the books in paperback and just had to have on my kindle as well to take with me when I travel.  These you just have to read again and again.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|Kind of lame if you think that she'd get away with that with English royalty, but I like the movie and have not watched it for a long time.
B0012HEB32|4.0|Great show with great special effects. Fun to watch back to back episodes! A bit  violent . . .  Had to hide the screen around the kids.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|Amazon's part of the deal did a great job. The writers of the music did a pretty good job, considering that it is a show and not music on the radio. It was interesting to me that they put Reyna's girls' cover of \\"Telescope\\" on the album but not Scarlett's cover of Avery's song. Good first album. Hopefully the next will be even better.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I really liked the story line and the animation was great. The characters were life like. Would watch it again.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse itself is pretty solid and comfortable, but the top buttons and scroll wheel are a little uncomfortable to use. The side buttons work fine, but the two above the scroll wheel require you to make your middle finger a claw and then stab the buttons, not too useful for I-need-my-action-now moments in games. The scroll wheel rolls fine, but is too far up on the mouse it as the same problem as the buttons. You either need to roll your wrist back to scroll with it or do the claw method. The right-handed shape of the mouse also forces your middle finger on the side of the wheel vs. on top of it. Also, its hard to pick up if you need to spin in the game more, though this can be fixed by changing the sensitivity. The mouse is very comfy if you place your whole palm on it, but not if you have a claw like grip on your mouse. The mouse is also bigger than my old one, so if you have a wrist comforter mousepad you will hit it a lot and be twisting the wrist to compensate for it.<br /><br />I give this a 4/5 because it is a very well made mouse, and its my first &#34;gaming&#34; mouse, so it might be just me accustoming myself to the new grip. I was using a standard 2-button and scroll wheel mouse for $20 before I bought this.
0312330537|5.0|Love this book. Such an amazing read. A little long, but so wise. I would recommend this book to anyone.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|this had my husband and I engrossed for hours!! We can hardly wait for the second chapter. bring it on!!
B0036D7Y1Q|4.0|Everyone in the cast sings very well, but the emotions are a little too uniform. It is definitely worth listening to, but you will not be moved.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Same theme as Hoosiers, but different culture. Samuel L Jackson was very good. His role risked success of student athletes against personal gain.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show. At the end of every show, I can't wait to see the next one. A wonderful insight to English history.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I think this game is the best game but it is  kinda hard because som.etimes it dosnt turn right for u.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a pleasant and page-turning read from beginning to end.  A fairytale teen-age love story.  Read it and see if you don't agree.
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|I love Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston together.  Their affair was very believeable.  Great action as well.  I really enjoyed this movie.
B00961ZGQC|4.0|Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Chris Evans makes for a great American Hero in this movie. The actress that plays his love interest in the movie is beautiful.  I real classic beauty.  I really enjoyed the action and the war scenes in this movie.  I hope they do a Captain America two.
B005LAII62|4.0|Got this for the grand kids at Christmas time. So far no complaints. They are four years and six years old.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game takes all of the things you love about Temple Run and make them better. Great new game, 5 out of 5 stars.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Got this for the grand kids at Christmas time. So far no complaints. They are four years and six years old.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This type of entertainment is typically not my cup of tea. Yet I find myself wanting to give each episode a go as soon as it is available.
B006O6EOII|5.0|producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Just discovered Firefly.  Loved the whole first season and the movie.  Fun, fun, fun... Only wish there was more...great story!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|So refreshing to see a female protagonist who is not exploited for her sexuality (though Anna Torv is plenty sexy!)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really liked this game, its addictive &amp; a lot of fun... until it erased all of my progress!!! Ugh.. please fix ASAP!
B000FC12C8|5.0|This book is very well done as well as being a classic.  Chapters 8 and 20 should be read more than once
B002RI9SC4|4.0|The Twilight Saga is simply addictive. I read every single book of it, even if it s a teen story really
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Beautifully written, engaging and easy to read, it's a smart book with plenty of collateral information about zoo management and animal training and a heck of a survival tale with a couple of surprises.  I enjoyed it thorougly and just preordered the it on Blu-Ray to air at our next book club.
B0031RS7X6|3.0|It s an OK book if u are at the beach or on a plane. It s entertaining but for sure not a masterpiece
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Among the best shows ever. Early on you get invested in the characters lives. It is the kind of show where anything can happen.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I really like this app.  Look, I don't think I'll ever &#34;PLAY&#34; piano, but after doing this &#34;game&#34; a few times, you DO kind of get a feel for the songs.  And it's a lot of FUN for a novice like me.
B0086449YA|5.0|This CD is a must for Mark Knopfler fans.  He never disappoints. His poetic talent for \\"painting a picture\\" is truly masterful. His haunting guitar enhances the mood, song after song.  If you liked \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", you'll like Privateering.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!!! No other words needed!! Just bought the third book. Can't wait to start it and see what happens next!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|In reflection of the orchestrations of  the many entertwining facets of this story, I am left with a perspective of how fragile this age of electronic information has made our world. This is yet another hang on by your fingernails, hold your breath and don't put it down creation.
0143116177|4.0|My wife read this, but I have yet to read it.  She said she enjoyed it and it was informative.  She thought that the ending indicated that the author had &#34;an axe to grind&#34;.
B007T967X4|5.0|I have three words for u get it get it get it well not actually three but u have to get it my grandson Matthew was having troble with music he is only 6 years old and he wants to be a pianist just get it
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have watched bits and pieces of this show over the years but could never tie it all together.  Well, getting the seasons as they started and grew has been such a delight.<br /><br />I love PBS shows in this era.  It was a romantic and naive era that cannot be found today in most nations.<br /><br />Thanks for taking us back to this era in time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game that i can play over and over again.  I recommend this game to anyone i know
B003NHRGSQ|2.0|Can't get into the story like the first one. I think im only I  chapter 4 and it seems like the story drags.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This is a great game that i can play over and over again.  I recommend this game to anyone i know
B000PY52EU|5.0|It took me a while to get around to this movie (2013), but there are a lot of very good older movies<br />to watch that don't cost you $20.00 a pop, and this is one of them.<br />Being a Blues,Jazz,Rock guitar player, I really fell in love with the simple 12 bar blues tunes that Jackson<br />knocked out.<br />I did leave another review of the soundtrack where I get into the guts (guitar tab) of main song.<br />This is a great watch, and at under $7.00, how can you go wrong.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use. Just right for me. All I needed was a free, user friendly, uncomplicated, regular calculator.
0307454568|5.0|Like the two previous books in this series, the story and the characters are great.  Ther is such suspense, even if you think it is going to turn out alright, you are not really sure! Too bad the author is gone as I am sure he would hav written many more good stories.

1933633867|5.0|The social sciences are divided into cubic disciplines. Each facet, as it were, offers us a unique perspective on human life. The particular vision of anthropology, therefore, opens up the narrow cultural horizon of our birth into the far more general.<br /><br />Normally, the basis of anthropological judgment is comparative. For example, in my own studies of the Tuareg in 1973, it was easy to determine that lineage is traced through the mother, and not the father, as in the European tradition. A bit more investigation would reveal that uncles (mother's brothers) serve as power figures that we normally associate with `fatherhood'.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of clan-association, which really isn't easy to figure out. Not only are the answers ambiguous from one Tuareg to the next, but also one discovers that, above the extended familial level, alliances shift and vary with obligations--precisely the `debt' of which Graeber speaks. In other words, the Tuareg causal arrow seems to indicate that nomenclature follows obligation.<br /><br />Lastly, Tuareg will vary their kinship terminology to reflect seasonal time and space, as well as economic situation. The question of who might be `related' to who is answered by the personal selection of the optimal term from a lexic grab-bag of contradictory labels of kinship.<br /><br />For example, a young man living a transhumant life on the floodplain of the Niger River might have an `uncle' from a far-away clan, six generations removed, who lives in Kabyle. Although they've never met, debt-obligation obliges the elder to act as `father' to this blue-skinned redneck who speaks a barely understood dialect of Am'zer.<br /><br />These debt-obligations are what make Tuareg the `Tuareg', and spread out, Pollock-like, over the canvass of North Africa. The work of the anthropologist is to trace the particular lines to establish a wider frame of reference. What defines a particular Tuareg's subjectivity is his/her own particular trajectory .<br /><br />In passing, this is why they will never abandon `Northern Mali' to the French uranium companies. The entirety of Tuareg identity is linked to this land through debt-obligation.<br /><br />Debt-obligation also extends in a vertical dimension, or with respect to class. These rights and obligations are verbal, clear, and quite contrary to anything one might imagine in Randite Amerikana.<br />Among the Tuareg, the mutual obligations are fulfilled by doing one's work--be it herding cattle, working the fields, or demanding protection money from caravans.<br /><br />The above explanation is a decent example of what one does to write a PhD in Anthropology. On the other hand, Graeber's canvas is the entire world. In my best moments, I envisage myself as having had the abilities to synthesize theory as well as Graeber. That I felt unable to do so is primarily the reason why I abandoned the field altogether, in 1980.<br /><br />The genius of Graeber's work resides in having extended the anthropological perspective to include with the non-modern both the origins of capitalism and what exists today. This, in a conceptual sense, is a difficult problem, and what stumped me back in the seventies: how, in essence, can anthropology offer a general economic theory which synthesized seemingly contradictory institutions? Students of Physics might offer the insight that this problem is somewhat akin to that of Maxwell's wave equations that did not fit into Newtonian mechanics. Might we therefore look upon Graeber's debt as his own discipline's Lorentz  Transformation?<br /><br />In any case, Anthropology has always been a major irritant to the yahoo set. These are the people who, by standards of general enlightenment, are so hopelessly ethnocentric that any scholarly discourse suggesting that Middle Amerika represents neither how the world is nor how it should be is considered fit for the bonfire.<br /><br />Graeber adds fuel by linking his General Theory of Debt toa committed activism. Because our economic affairs are not `natural' in the Aristotelian sense (recurrently universal), they can be changed. In other words, what we understand of classical economic theory is time and place specific. Neither markets nor money are universal; without this `scientific' groundwork, Economics merely tells us how we've chosen to arrange our affairs.<br /><br />Graeber, in short, is rubbing his discipline into the faces of the TINA people. Yes, he's saying, there are alternatives, and to say otherwise makes you a self-serving, lying, pos--because the proof is precisely what I've shown it to be.<br /><br />My only `criticism' so to speak, is his eagerness to engage the ignorami. Not being an Amerikan, he probably thinks that these people can somehow be brought around. Or perhaps, being far younger than I, he just enjoys a good brawl.<br /><br />America delenda est, I say to all that. Or perhaps in the more polite sense of Dante, `Follow your own course, and let the rabble talk'.<br /><br />Lastly, of course, I offer him a deep, sincere thanks for having written such an important book.<br /><br />BH
B007MDB6L0|5.0|YES!  Love this movie.  I have 2 little girls under the age of 6 and not only do THEY love it, but i love how Dewey sounds EXACTLY like Father Guido Sarducci!!!  that alone kept me entertained.
0761169431|5.0|After enjoying the Origami Yoda and Darth Paper books at school my son asked for this book on his wishlist. While the designs in here are a little more complicated and require a lot more precise folding than OY and DP books, this is still a lot of fun and the preprinted pages are a nice addition.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a heart warming story of a young women in a hellish situation that survives and finds true love.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of those really great arcade games that dont have much point but things just keep flying at you faster until you mess up and slice a bomb! The free version was great for me as a casual player. You still have the ability to unlock new backgrounds and swords you just have to click out of an ad before playing.... but what do you want for nothing?
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome fun! The graphics are amazing. Very impressed with the fluidity of play that the game has! Very Very Nice!
085786078X|5.0|An avid fan of Simon, I roared with laughter as the addition of one smart kitten so specifically matched what we had experienced when our male cat received a brother.  We leave it in the guest room for our friends to enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was an enjoyable read that filled a transcontinental flight. While the topic is not humorous, the characters are entertaining and the dialog well written. I would recommend to a friend.
B008Y78M60|4.0|An interesting, easy watch, good entertainment. Sad commentary about we the people. I pray each of us can lose more of ourselves and try hard to be more like Lincoln.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is much better than the first Temple Run. It looks better, it plays better, it is hard to go back to the first temple run.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|great movie, plenty of suspense and action.  holds your interest, far out story, could really happen, makes you think ,more!!.......wdn
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Its a music CD.  The tunes play and that's about all I expect from a CD.  I like some of the tunes better than others, but that's normal for any music CD.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|As a big Harrison Ford movie, I had never seen Morning Glory. I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This series seems to have gotten its second wind. Both the story and humor exceeded expectations. If you enjoyed the first Ice Age film, you'll enjoy this third sequel almost as much.
B000L212HC|5.0|The Prestige was one of the few Christian Bale movies that I had not seen, and it was a fun movie to watch.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This story feels like a sequel of a sequel, which of course is exactly what it is. I think what is exasperating is that really nothing changes from one film to the next - the human race is overrun by mutants and nothing ever improves, no progress is made - the film could just as easily be called &#34;Alice kicks butt again&#34; and at least you'd know not to expect more. I watch this series only because of Milla Jovovich, but I really feel she is wasting her talent on this series - it's a Far Cry from the original &#34;Resident Evil&#34; and films like &#34;Fifth Element&#34;.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|The Captain America movie was not what I expected, but I definitely enjoyed it. I have never followed the &#34;Avengers&#34; characters but this was a good movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|If I caught someone peddling children as slaves to aliens, they would be instantly in front of a firing squad. But not in this program - instead they are simply told to \\"go away\\". But despite this recurring theme of liberal, bleeding hearts nonsense, the characters are likeable, engaging and the stories interesting enough to keep me coming back for more. The program veers between a character portrayal of the worst but also the best of human nature. Sure the premise of \\"alien invaders who can't quite seem to get the job done\\" does seem a bit weak, but someone in the script department knows how to spin a decent yarn. Truth be told there isn't much decent sci-fi left on TV so we take what we can get... so four stars.
B000FJGWBM|4.0|I gave Memento four stars because it is by Christopher Nolan, but this is by far my least favorite of his movies. Did nothing for me.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|the picture is a portrait of an ugly side of life.  That's not why I watch movies.  I watch movies to get away ugly things.  That said, Denzel Washington is a great actor and he makes this picture.  Worth watching.

B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great, surprising thriller of a book. So many twists and unexpected turns. The writing was clever and different from anything I've ever read.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I enjoyed Inception. It was one of those movies where you had to pay attention to every detail, and I was entertained.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run one got old after a while. With all the new twist and turns (especially in the mines) this version is definitely more entertaining!
B005H9B44A|4.0|I have never been into the &#34;Avengers&#34; movies but have started going through them. I was entertained by this movie for sure. The &#34;hidden&#34; clips are brief but make me want to see more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great series! I couldn't put them down! I was very skeptical about the story. I had no interest in reading a book about children killing children. I was intrigued though and I'm glad I gave it a try. Suzanne Collins did a good job keeping the books clean considering the plot. I would be comfortable letting my teenager read this series. Again, great series!

B00190N4E4|5.0|Gandhi is a 1982 biographical film about the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. The film opens up with a scene of Gandhi's unfortunate death, then quickly thrusts the viewer back to the earlier life and events that lead to him becoming one of history's most admired activists.<br />The film takes you through Gandhi's life as he makes the decision after being thrown from a \\"white's only\\" train, to dedicate his life to gaining equality for Indians. Gandhi is pictured as a quiet humble man, seeking fair and just treatment for Muslim and Hindu Indians. India was once dominated by British rule, which Gandhi sought to overcome through non-violent protests. He quickly gains followers of his peaceful tactics and forges ahead to bring light to the issues of poverty, unfair treatment to women, and a lack of moral and religious ethics.<br />As Gandhi and his followers seek fair treatment, the British become angry and increasingly aggressive. Several scenes break your heart as you see the people of India beaten down simply for requesting the same freedoms and respect that should be inalienable to everyone. Non-violence was crucial in this effort, as it demonstrated the behavior of love and honor that was being taught in religious teachings such as the Christian faith.<br />The refusal to physically fight back does not come easily for everyone, and you see tragic deaths throughout the film. The disagreement about the tactics being used to accomplish independence and equality are also what results in Gandhi's assassination.<br />Viewing this film was a perfect addition to my studies of World Religions, as it not only depicted the recent topic of Hindu culture, but also demonstrated the pluralistic behavior of Gandhi. Although he was a practicing Hindu, he embraced other religions such as Christianity and Islam. One of Gandhi's most memorable quotes which demonstrates his equal respect for all faiths and people is \\"A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history\\".

B0066W1AZK|4.0|All the basic features work nice.  I like that it tracks how many games are won and lost.  I dislike that it reset the count back to zero after app closed.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I couldn't stop reading.  Her life in her words offer a unique insight.  I especially love how she is completely dedicated to protecting her girls.  A strong woman with a tremendous heart.<br />I do not recommend this book for young children as I don't think they could comprehend the subject.

B000NTPDSW|1.0|I was looking forward to watching all 3 Godfather movies' Part One was going along fine until the \\"hospital' \\" scene.<br /><br />Then nothing. I mean nothing else was on the disc. Contacted Amazon, they sent out a replacement, quickly too, I might add.<br /><br />Popped in Part  One of replacement and .... nothing.....  very disappointing.<br /><br />Needless to say replacement will also be returned, this time I want a refund.

B005PK56TA|4.0|I like watching horror movies, so of course I wanted to watch &#34;American Horror Story&#34;. The story line is interesting, but at times stretches it beyond what I thought what was credible. Of course every horror movie has something someone thinks is unbelievable, and AHS is 20+ hours long for the first season. The acting is good, and Jessica Lange is great.
0446547654|5.0|I have all of Nicholas Sparks' books and am adding this to my collection and the great price for a hard covered book.

B004TI5N38|5.0|My husband gave me the second book first...he did not realize this one existed.  I loved that book so I immediately purchased this one.  I love the main character...his very interesting family background.  It all makes him a multifaceted person.
0345537998|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out. I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time. I purchased a new copy several years ago and again was enthralled.<br />I checked it out of the library this past year and again it was a great read. I  am always pulled into the novel as if I am in the story with the characters. I read very fast, but when I read a good book I find myself slowing down as I read. I become immersed  as if I am one of the characters.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time! This book is a WONDER!! Great perspectives from all the main characters....realistic dialogue and believable situations. I'm a high school teacher and plan to use it in class. Amazing book!!

B005S9EJ14|4.0|I LOVE this movie!  Ten stars for production and location. Ten stars for cast and acting.<br /><br />The fly in the ointment is the shallow plot. Thirty minutes of revision would have fixed ALL of what's wrong with the movie.<br /><br />All that time and money spent on a bad plot...
0694003611|5.0|this book is pricless. i think the hole word knows good night moon . and if they dont well they are missing out . seller was great , come fast . good price.
B00APUQPX6|2.0|These stars obviously did this one for the money. My family was very disappointed, they loved the other Ice Age movies, but this one is best avoided and rewatch the old ones
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this band to me.  I am glad I listened.  They produce some very unique music with wonderful emotion, powerful lyrics and keep me coming back.  Definitely worth the purchase.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|There was a ton of extra content included in the collector's edition. No it doesn't answer every question, but it does give you a lot of insight into this epic masterpiece.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I love David's books because of the detail in all his plots.  I would love to proof read for him.  This one lived up to him reputation.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|LOVED this book. If you're a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, this is a really interesting read. It's hard to explain what it's about without giving anything away, but trust me, it's worth it! Also, if you're skeptical, you can download Part 1 alone for free and see if you like it. That's what I did and I was hooked!! Lots of plot twists and surprises & Howey paints a detailed picture with words of this &#34;futuristic&#34; landscape.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|It's acdc so it's awesome.  I bought it before I knew the catalogue became newly available on iTunes, so paid more than if I only got a few of the songs. But it's acdc so I'm good with that.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Kinda got out there on story but was a good ending and if you like lost this will not disapoint
1563898586|5.0|Great story and art. I liked the art in Marshall Law, and its just as well done here. All of the literary cameos are fun too.  I saw the movie version a while back and thought it wasn't that good but this book is excellent. I got volume 2 recently and actually enjoyed it even more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so pleased to see further character development in the daughters. Viewing the series was a nice luxury. Where can we purchase those dresses?
B000YT3KEA|5.0|Nice condensed version of he original suitable or my four year old. My two year old loves the pictures and we paraphrase the story for her even more. Nicely done.
B005PK553C|5.0|Can't stop watching! Jessica Lange is the perfect damaged southern magnolia. She mesmerizes with her sweet southern drawl and her painful psychosis. She is truly wicked and frightening.
B008Y73940|4.0|The plot was great, the acting was excellent!  I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish.  Definitely kept me interested!
B007UW9VWO|5.0|I just finished watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi. It is a great documentary, even if you don't like sushi, full of life lessons. It is interesting, inspirational, informative and enlightening. I give it two thumbs up, five stars and highly recommend it to one and all. We could all learn a lot about life and professional passion from this sushi master.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Like most riewers, I loved it.  This is an award winning series, and deserves the awards and acalades it has received.
B00338QENI|5.0|I do not have a science background, but the author explains cell biology in such a way that anyone can understand. The ethical questions raised are important and illustrate how concepts like patient privacy, patenting of genes, etc., change and develop with new knowledge and technology. This book does not read like nonfiction in the sense that you are caught up in the stories of the lives of all involved. I am going to miss them when I finish the book.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these for my husband to play Mech Warrior Online and he absolutely LOVES them! I wanted to get him a great headset without spending a ton of money and these are PERFECT!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Beautifully written and thought provoking. Yes, our world has annoyances, inconveniences, and pain...but without those things we would not have choices, beauty, or love. The Giver reminds us of that.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing quality video and sound for a streaming video! Would highly recommend to any fans of this genre. HD Quality is superb!
0547884591|1.0|There are a number of categories in which this book fails very badly, so, allow me to present the micro (well-sort of micro, they are all pretty major issues in and of themselves) faults in each category so you can understand why when you put them all together it feels very much like a giant pile of steaming ...something. I will begin with the less serious and move to the worst things.<br /><br />*The actual writing* This is poor, the two-columns used through most of the book are not even justified so you get the same feel of a text that was formatted for the web, which looks messy. The actual writing needs considerable editing to pass even my rather lax standards of written English, and the book uses lots of images and pictures and has plenty of blank spaces all over the place. If you got rid of the pointless images with \\"clever quotes\\" that give the whole book a kind of lame \\"lads' mag with \\"clever\\" quotes\\" feel, you would probably be left with only half the pages he has in it.<br /><br />*The structure* It's virtually non-existent. It may well appeal to a generation of ritalin addicted ADHD youngsters that can't keep their thoughts on one thing at a time for longer than 5 seconds, I could see that in this respect it may cater to a \\"market\\" as such perhaps, but don't fool yourself into thinking any of these readers will go on to \\"accomplish\\" the feats Ferriss keeps telling us he has achieved (more on this later). If it was not intentionally written to appeal to a superficial, easily-distracted-by-shiny-objects category of reader, then I can only conclude that it was written this way because the writer is one himself.<br /><br />*The name-dropping/lying by omission/general douchery* On almost every page Ferriss name-drops with nauseating regularity, usually followed by some over-long anecdote of something he did at world-class level in the company of so-and-so. At first you try to excuse it, but after a while it just becomes truly obnoxious. Much like trying to bein a room with \\"Topper\\" the fictional character invented by the creator of the Dilbert cartoons. Topper has already done it, before anyone and going backwards. Neil Armstrong? that was nothing, I went to the moon on a pogo stick in 1958. That sort of thing. It's made actually WORSE by the fact that Ferriss tries to play \\"humble\\" in a way that only someone that is spectacularly narcissistic could do. You can sense the highly selective way he describes his accomplishments and the omissions he makes about the hows and whys not just of his accomplishments in general, but of some of the details concerning any particular skill acquisition too. Ferriss obviously thinks he is a very smart and very talented person. I'll say that I guess he is probably pretty well-placed for narcissistic self-promoter/marketer of the year, but... a) I don't like those type of people, and more importantly b) they never really deliver on anything and this book is a case in point.<br /><br />*overall*<br />Taking the above points in mind and mixing them together would be enough for most people to not want to waste money on it, however there were a few \\"meta\\" points I wanted to describe too. Quite a LOT of the book is actually devoted to cooking. Given I could not care less about the subject matter (I think most humans on Earth are capable of making a few dishes well with a minimum of effort required in learning if they want to do so) I was surprised that I actually think I found another, less obvious reason why Ferriss wrote this book. Apart from the more obvious one already touched upon (I am so great, look at me and what I can do/what I know/Where I have been and ALSO WHO I know, as well as I am famous, I write bestsellers etc. etc.) I think there is a GENUINE reason why Ferriss probably did try to learn quite a lot about cooking and food etc. etc. He keep mentioning all over his book that the aim is to be able to cook 2 dinners a week..why? I asked myself...I think filtering all the rest outI got the answer. Ferriss seems to be the type of compulsive obsessive person that has real trouble creating an maintaining real human relationships, and I got the distinct sense that his whoe \\"I can cook like a master-chef\\" persona was HEAVILY involved with wanting to be more appealing to the opposite sex. Apparently he has now had a girlfriend for over a year (He mentioned this in one of his random videos which I watched) and maybe it's just me but I got the very real feeling that cooking twice a week was his way of perhaps being \\"different\\" and \\"special\\" and though I can't know this for sure, if I had to bet money on it I would say that I've concluded that Tim Ferris wrote the 4-hour chef mostly because he thinks cooking for women/his significant other will get him laid more often/better. It's actually kind of sad. I'm not saying maybe this isn't the case, but I found his level of \\"desperation\\" which seeps throughout the cooking section only subconsciously I think, so maybe I am just imagining it, admittedly, but again, if I had to bet money on it... The other thing is that after a little research, I just find his over-the-top-claims to be a really bad case of \\"selective memory\\" and \\"selective raconteour bias\\". Sadly, I am not sure how aware Ferriss is of his personality. I get a true sense of someone perennially trying to overcompensate for something. I realise these may seem like personal attacks, but honestly they are not. I don't know him or care about his success, in the main, I am happy for people to be successful. It's the main sense of the personality of the guy that permeates the book and it makes for a very unpleasant reading experience overall. My only personal objection to Ferriss would be that his success, as far as I can tell would seem to stem to a large degree from deceiving people to some degree or other about both his as well as their accomplishments.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Excellent story in classic literature  Well written and depicts the futility and vanity of our search for eternal youth.  Another best seller by well known author Oscar Wilde

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This Was A Good Book. lots Of Tears, Thrills, And Laughs. Reading The Second Of The Trilogy Now.  Hope It's As Good As This One. Haven't Seen The Movie But After Reading The Books I'm Not Sure I'll Want To, movies Are Usually A Disappointment If You've Read The Book.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is a wonderful show. It has No bad language. It also has great music. The characters are well developed.  It's a memorable show.

B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I realize I'm in the minority here but I think I prefer this cast over The Next Generation.  I'm not a huge Trek fan or anything but I like the fact that they have so many episodes on series like this.  There's not a whole lot of space exploration shows on so it's good if you are looking for something different.  Just don't expect a stellar script or outstanding acting.  For me the special effects were good for a tv series and never distracted from the show.  The storylines were original and unique. This series can be streamed for free with Amazon Prime.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for something different from what is on tv right now in the scifi genre.  Just remember this wasn't a series up for any awards...
159514188X|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter, and she love it, she said that it was a shamed that the girl killed herself, it was not worst it, there is much in life that you can find

B00821PCJS|5.0|Series is very well done and is not fake fealing sci fi.  I would recommend to my friends that watch sci fi.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Will not spoil it for anyone but expect the unexpected with the plot twists.  James is James, got a new Q (geek with lots of attitude and personality definitely a great pick) got the movie on Instant Video and keep watching over and over because this one has many things you can miss in the background and up front.  Daniel Craig still one of the best replacement Bonds.  His acting is always dead on and he puts on his Bond suit and becomes Bond.  The ending will be something you haven't  seen in a Bond movie before,
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Watched on Amazon Instant Video on my iPad and the series is amazing.  Also downloaded the Doctor Who Matt Smith (holiday) specials to prepare me for the upcoming series.  Stephen Moffatt has done a superb job with this show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun way to pretend I have a horse of my own. Easy to use. Works very well on the Kindle Fire.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great tv series! Everyone who has ever liked Doctor Who and other alien series should watch this! I can't wait for season 3!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|excellent writing, engaging story.  I love it when I writer tells the story in a way where I can feel a part of it and it stimulates my mind in visual ways.  This book did that for me
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Loved this show.  The character of Tate was a rollercoaster of emotion.  Here, piggy piggy piggy!  Can't wait to watch season 2.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|We love Sherlock and could not wait till it came out on disc.  Now we can watch anytime we like!

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|What can I say, we love Tintin and have watched it multiple times and with commentary.  We love commentary.  Thank you!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The CD was everything I expected. Great music and good quality. Looking forward to their next album release and tour. Great mixture of music similar to Mumford and Sons and Ryan Adams.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Once you figure out how to maneuver around everything so your not deleting the picture every time; it makes great relaxation,fun to use,and willing to recommend to all.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story hooked me in right away.  It was well written and really held my interest to the last page. I prefer happy endings but that is not real life. The slavery era was full of cruelity and unspeakable secrets -  this story has both as well as some very memorable characters. The book was reccomended by a friend and I am glad it was.  I have already reccomended it to others.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It came in handy and at this time there was no problems to report. Definitely can recommend this product to everyone
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have never read a more inspiring story. Will make you wonder what you have done with your life? If you are a fan of Lone Survivor, Service, American Sniper, or Outlaw Platoon- you will love this book.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game reminded you of the good old times. However when trying to get the pac-man to steer it became difficult at times.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|My thoughts and feelings on this book are complicated by my own previous relationship with a bipolar person, but I'm happy that Pat finds clarity, peace, and support. By about halfway through, it really diverges from the movie - or, the movie diverges from the book, rather - and I kind of preferred the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, but the book was sweet and disconcerting and thought-provoking anyway.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Super One of my favorite series, funny, great action, can't stop watching ......<br />.....<br />...<br />.///<br />..<br /><br />.//<br />\.<br /><br />ll\

B0089EHWQE|4.0|It was a well written book but I normally like more upbeat subject matter. It didn't end the way I thought it would.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game and easy to learn to use. It will pass the time. Not a complete waste. You can get a Zebra or a Unicorn.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game is ok. Its a decent distraction from boredom. Geesh I really don't have 10 more words to say about this game
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this is the best game that i have found by far! talk about keeping your brain working. it keeps you constantly trying to be more focusted and faster not to mention, its fun!
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Good movie. Decent story. Pretty good action. Not sure if two guys could really share a girl like that without there being some issues. But it did make for a good story.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Book two did not disappoint, in fact I found it to be even better! By the second half of the book I was having a hard time putting it down:)

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very good. It kept my interest from chapter to chapter.<br />Anxious to finish the series. Highly recommend to anyone.<br />Awesome series
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book glad I finally read it. A little slow in the beginning but picks up quickly. Would definitely recommend reading.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't start watching the show until January, 2013. Watched the first season on Netflix and had to buy season 2! Now am up to date and watching current episodes on PBS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that Temple Run 2 is an amazing game. You can slide down a pipeline and a big fat monkey follows you instead of 3 or 4. Temple Run 2 is so cool because everywhere you look you see optical illusions. That makes the game harder, but makes it more fun.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|If I had watched this on TV when it first came out 10 years ago, I would have been really ticked off that it was cancelled after the first season.  Well worth watching from Amazon Prime.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Collins always throws in a twist that no one was expecting and that's why I absolutely love reading her books. This book was just as good as the first and got me ready to jump right into the third.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Second set of the trilogy is sizzling exciting and full of surprises with a wonderful ending. Can't wait till number 3!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is my favorite show of all times.  I recommend this to all.  I fell in love with it while traveling to London on our in flight tv.  Purchased seasons 1 and 2, and so far season 3 is awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!! The best game ever. I'm soo addicted to it. I can't stop playing the game. I play it everyday single day.
B004P12SSW|5.0|This movie was recommended to me.  I did not think I would like it.  Watched it and was very surprised.  Very good.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|i found that i very much enjoyed the film. but it seem to be over to soon and the ending was not what i was hoping for.
1609611543|1.0|This book is written in a typical health-fad way: grandiose claims pointing to one simple cause of just about any ailment, and pretending that people from long ago were paragons of health. There's also plenty of anecdotal pseudoscience and vague descriptions designed to appeal to the emotions.<br /><br />The fact is that most people eat \\"modern\\" conspiracy-theory wheat without becoming obese or developing debilitating illnesses. There are other lifestyle and cultural issues at play.<br /><br />Wheat sensitivity can be a real thing and if that makes a difference for you then avoid it, sure. Low carb diet? Nothing new there. Most people on gluten-free diets don't have Celiac disease (there was a study about that). Most of the stuff in this book isn't actually backed up by science and the stuff that is, is pretty obvious stuff.<br /><br />Writing \\"pop-med\\" books like this must be much more profitable than doing peer-reviewed medical research.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|GREAT BOOK  (Destiny Harris recommend)<br /><br />I like this book because it helped me with my essay<br />I recommend this book to other studentships write essays
B004EF65QA|5.0|Even though this mini-series takes some liberties in  adapting E. Gaskel's original narration , it is done with amazing sensitivity<br />and does not essentially  alter the story-line.  The casting and acting is superb . I can't think of a better BBC production . This is<br />better than any of the J. Austen mini-series .  I just loved it and consider North and South almost a work of art : you never tire of it .  - But , just like the book ,  I wish the final scenes had been a better match for the rest of the production . Elizabeth Gaskel had a valid excuse for the sudden ending of her story , the author of this screenplay did not , and took the easy way out . Still ,<br />I loved it and know that I will watch it many more times.
B007IK44CK|1.0|Yes, it's fast-paced and has lots of thrills. But it doesn't have anything else and eventually the whole thing gets numbing. In fact I was so bored by the time it got to the big skyscraper climb my attention wandered and I actually lost track of what was happening.
B005PK553C|4.0|The experience of obtaining the shows couldn't be easier or more convienient through the amazon instant video app. The show is great.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Lots of the animation scenes were pretty amazing, but I didn't love the story. Not so great for kids, either.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Would recommend this game. From my  four year old granddaughter to my eleven year old neice they loves it alot.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I saw the movie in 3D at the theater which is probably the best way to see it.  On my tv screen isn't bad since the story is still excellent!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|My neice downloaded it and I didnt get a chance to play it so from her point of view it is ok.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Good entertainment.  Moves along at a good pace. I'm glad I watched it and got caught up with the storyline.  Now I have to watch the other movies in this series.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Only watched a couple of episodes and i don't think it is as good as Deep Space Nine but worth watching.
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|I thought it was more of a comedy.  Maybe it was but I couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off after 10 minutes.  Terrible movie.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|there's nothing better then the Tudors, i just wish they would have continued the series beyond Henry, I would have absolutely loved to have seen his children's reins as well by these same writers and director since from what i understand the children's reins were also pretty turbulent and interesting.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|For many years those of us who were cryptophiles had little resources to consult except oblique references in histories or very dense and technical mathematical descriptions.  I am glad this book is now on Kindle.  I loved the paper version of it.  Singh has the gift of explaining what seems at first glance confusing in a way that makes it accessible and fun.  Through his narrative we come to understand the absolutely vital role that ciphers and codes played in history as we learn how these systems were constructed and then deconstructed only for the process to begin again.  By all means, get a piece of paper and enjoy playing along.  It's a timely topic since we now live in an age awash with information and are learning the hard way what can ensue if we don't find ways to protect it.  If nothing else learning the Playfair cipher is one way to defeat the snoops in your corporate email system.  Very readable and great fun.
0937381888|1.0|This book is great except for the fact that pages are missing!! Apparently this is not uncommon from this publisher. Check that you have all the pages when you receive the book, so you dont get screwed by Amazon's return policy if you don't happen to read the darn thing front to back in the first 30 days...
B003AQBWRQ|5.0|I'm an adult with no children and bought this for myself as Christmas present last year. I set it up in my knick knack cabinet. A friend of mine admired it so I bought one for her for Christmas. She was thrilled with it.  Said she had so much fun setting it up and every time she walked by it she turned the Christmas tree on!  The quality is excellent with attention to detail (there's a mini nativity set, how cute is that?!!).  I actually felt like buying myself the dollhouse! -- But thought people would start to question my sanity!  Totally brought out my inner child.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It is a great application to use to share photos with your family and friends, and is very user-friendly. It can be used to do a bunch of things.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the app.  love all the different versions and the reading plans.  definitely recommend this app for daily Bible reading and study
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It was fun untilit started to get boring so I stopped playing they should add more world tours so its fun.not beth happy:(
B008133MDK|5.0|Holmes was British after all. Excellent production showing Sherlock at his quirkiest best. I couldn't wait to see the next episode. I'm only sorry and disappointed because it appears that the series was discontinued.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I don't know if the problem is the end user or actual program.  I cannot figure out how to delete a note and it takes an effort for me to complete a note-I type and the letters do not appear on the screen-I have to save the note get out of the and continue to start over.  I really want to get a hang of Evernote because I think it a great tool.
B008FBMLRQ|5.0|This concert was filmed and recorded in one take and is a flawless representation of an iconic band. I have never heard a better concert recorded. This is a band that has been around over 30 years and is still keeping it fresh and hot. I highly recommend you take a listen. Your ears will thank you.
B009A7E7SK|5.0|I like the this workout because I can take it wherever I go.  I like the demonstration and the pace of each workout and the explanation of which body part is being affected.
B0092QITO2|1.0|Would be a good movie, if the audio didnt drop out like every minute, so annoying you can not enjoy, will just piss you off. Sony needs to fix this.  This movie is going back to the store. Lots of info on line about this issue.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|This is a remarkable story about a gifted musician.  The film does a very good job presenting and then solving a mystery.  It did leave me wondering if everyone in Detroit is a philosopher.  I think it's possible.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very good graphics and animation  sequences. I was also impressed by the detail of the scenes. Well worth the money.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book continues to be well reviewed but I thought that it was not living up to its hype.  The story has a good premise, explained in the other reviews, but it quickly falls apart and (without spoiling it) about half way into the mystery really loses steam from the woman's side of the story.  The man's side is hangs together pretty well until the end, then the &#34;twist&#34; just becomes a mechanism to try to thrill the reader rather than bring the book to a satisfying conclusion.  I would skip it, there are better books out there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is getting better and better.  I loved Season 1--Season 2 is positively addicting.  So many twists and turns in the plot.  The viewer is never bored.  Bravo!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not great literature but a really good read.  The other reviews hit on the plot so as not to duplicate them suffice it to mention that Mitch is back at it and the story is a good one and right in today's headlines.  If you like this series, this one is worth getting even in hard back.  Enjoyable.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome what this man accomplished with his God given personality and gifts once he really accepted his Maker's love.  Adam's resultant love and commitment to his wife is very inspiring.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book! I couldn't put it down! I read it in a week and that's only because I had to work! It was AMAZING!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We started watching it on a Friday night and were compete with season 2 by Sunday night. It was really well done! You have to be able to handle the subject matter...an asylum can be heavy for some. But we loved the conclusion too.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I enjoy this app very much.  Having family and friends out of state this alows me<br />to see what the weather is like where they are .  Grandkids involved in soccer<br />volleyball, etc.  lets me know if it's game on or not.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a well-produced, smartly-cast, and brilliantly-acted contemporary play on the classic characters. The first episode's twist on the original novel is pleasantly done. I'm looking forward to any more Sherlock I can get my eyes on.
0425252868|5.0|A great way to learn new things about an importaint time in history.This book is a tough one to put down once you start it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. I'm so addicted and cant stop playing it. it is decently worth 7 dollars. It still needs some updates but they are minor such as they need to add buckets. They are constantly coming out with updates that improve the game quality. I highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys a creative game.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|these are great shows and are very entertaining for all ages. Great casts and writing as well as good music.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! Tina Fey's writing was funny and thoughtful. Great for a woman who is looking for inspiration in the workplace or home life.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I liked this book because it was a morph of mystery, action, a giant puzzle, and sci-fi. However it had a lot of blood and violence, but it was still 100% awesome.
1450419895|1.0|Do not expect speedy service in shipping your product. You may get two day shipping with prime but that doesn't matter when the company your are purchasing from does not take your product to be shipped. I ordered this book on the 4th of February and it still has not been taken to the shipping carrier today on the 10th of February. I have the book and the book rocks though... this was just a birthday present for a good buddy of mine. Must get book for any person who attends to a gym schedule.
0525478817|5.0|Amazing!!!! I started it on a Friday and finished it on Saturday night! I was told to read it by one of my students and they were right!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|If your a fan of the games this is a must have! Answers a lot of questions and gives great insight to the characters.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|did get to see all the episode from Kindle b/c only allowed me four episode. Everything about Fringe is great - it never disappoints.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is gorgeously written and visually evocative.  We can only imagine how Pi's open religious exploration has impacted his sensory interpretation and analysis of his devastating experiences.  We are left to wonder whether his story is a defense mechanism, delirium, reality, or a combination of all.  The book allows us to explore the depths of human endurance and perhaps the way we order our experiences in order to survive and bring meaning to life.  Life of Pi is a quick, engaging, and thought provoking read.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|if you remember and like the X files, you'll like this. A bit preposterous at times, but a likable set of characters
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for horse lovers. I love that u can care for your own horse! The graphics are spectacular. Five stars for this app
B00931JMRE|5.0|this album just jumps out of your speakers - a lovely meaty production and some great songs - never boring, and highly recommended
B00993I6D2|5.0|This movie adaptation is as faithful to the novel as it could possibly be, given the fact that long passages of the story are Winston's internal reflections on the society he inhabits. Nothing is added to Orwell's book and very little is deleted or re-sequenced except what is necessary to make this very cerebral story coherent on film. Much of the script is drawn directly from the text of the novel. Visually, the movie is notable for its drab colors and shabby, dilapidated sets which is exactly what one should expect if they've read the novel. Even the set decoration in Winston's row of cubicles in the Ministry Of Truth is exactly what one would expect. The acting is exceptional with a pall of &#34;Orwellian&#34; fatalism hanging over all of the characters except for the mindlessly menacing Outer Party drones amongst whom Winston works in Minitrue. Richard Burton is perfect in what would turn out to be his final role as O'brien, the treacherous Inner Party agent of the Thought Police and Winston's calmly sadistic inquisitor. The only aspect of the film that may be difficult for the non-reader of the novel will be the surreal depictions of Winston's premonitions of his own fate and disjointed flashbacks of his own childhood. I loved the novel and I love this movie. However, if you're looking for a positive message or a happy, life affirming ending, look elsewhere. This movie is not for you.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|The plot sounds lame, I know. But the movie really is extremely well done. The brothers and father were all perfectly cast. A great movie about the devils inside us all and how we each choose to fight them.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I liked that she had to figure out paths for each screen for Perry to be able to move on. She played for quite awhile and did not want to put it down when she had to go home!
0525952926|5.0|Great continuation of &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.  Good history lesson of the world powers and events the situations that lead up to WW1 & 2.  Characters brought to life people's lives in &#34;those days&#34;.
B0053O89IS|5.0|My daughter lives in Berline Germany and saw an episode of Bones while visiting us and fell in love with the TV show.  So, Momma buys each season so she and her husband can join us in watching one of our favorite TV shows.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Well worth the 5 star rating. Watched the entire season. Recommend to anyone that likes Stargate SG-1 and/or science fiction.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I installed the Kindle for Android on my 9 year old granddaughter's Incredible and she just loves it.  I frequently find her reading books on her Incredible now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great show will continue watching.Downton Abby is well written and the actors play there parts viry well.I cannot wait to see what happens next.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Very disappointed! Nothing at all like the first 3..................MP#3 was pnenominal! Very predictable and did not keep my interest.Some good action scenes but kinda cheezy ones too!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It made me think about the times in which these people lived. History becomes so much more personal when it is portrayed in a story like this one. The Kitchen House is a page-turner very much like &#34;The Help&#34;.
