B00DW1WR14|1.0|I don't know why the last 3 albums Eddie sounds like he has a kazoo for a microphone but his voice sounds strange in all 3. At least the last 2 were rock I don't know what this crap is. It's a joke. I'm done defending them if they are gonna put out garbage like this. Sounds like 1 or 2 tracks leftover from Backspacer and a whole bunch of LAME filler. Well, at least the first 5 albums were good! My wife and I are PJ fans from way back. All the albums, the DVDs, PJ20 and love it all but not this. Lightning Bolt? Yeah... right...
1451673442|5.0|All I can say is inspirational, inspirational, inspirational.  I would recommend this to anyone who is ready to ask for guidance when it comes to attracting things into their lives.  Loved this book.  Thank you, Rhonda Byrne for inspiring me again and again. :)

1442337966|5.0|LOVED the Power.  It truly demonstrates that Love is all powerful.  There is nothing stronger.  I recommend this to those who don't know where to turn anymore.  This book spells out in the simplest way how to give and receive love.  Rhonda narrates this and she is charming and sweet with her Aussie accent in delivering such a profound message.  Thank you, Rhonda, again.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is the first Kelly Clarkson album I've purchased and I love it.  It has all her major hits.  This CD would be great for anyone to likes Kelly and her more popular songs.
0920668372|5.0|My daughter and I both cry after reading this book--she's 32 and having her first child.  This book goes through all the stages of life of a child from infant to adult.  No matter what &#34;my baby you'll be&#34;!  Beautiful book!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Way too much unnecessary bad, ugly, foul language!  I would never choose to read another one of her books.  Read excerpts of her other books & it looks like she uses the same kind of language in those also.

1476727651|3.0|I'm happy to be one of the millions of Stephen King fans, one of his Constant Readers. I had looked forward to reading Dr. Sleep, the sequel to The Shining, but I found the novel disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I totally enjoyed reading it, it was just not one of my favorites. Even worse. I mean The Dead Zone wasn't one of my favorites either, but it was an awesome book. The same with 11/22/63. But Dr. Sleep is nowhere near The Dead Zone or 11/22/63.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep reads like a collage of previous Stephen King novels. It reminded me how much I loved the Stand, and Dreamcatcher, and Insomnia. But when you peel off the stuff King borrows from his earlier works, there's not much left for Dr. Sleep to be, except a small puff of steam dissipating in darkness.<br /><br />Let's just say that Dr. Sleep is much better than a Dean Koontz novel, and not as boring as Bag of Bones.<br /><br />But it's not a good Stephen King novel.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep is about Dan Torrance. The kid from The Shining is now a grown man fighting alcoholism and a bad temper. While he tries to stay sober, he decides to redeem his sins by using his shining in a positive way. That is, working in a hospice, he helps sick people die peacefully. After being coached by Dan, a.k.a. Dr. Sleep, old people manage to give their last breath -- \\"the gasp\\" -- and there is a red steam rising out of their mouths, nose and eyes. The mist hovers around their body and then fades mysteriously.<br /><br />Now, Dan gets in touch with another prodigy who has the shining, Abra Stone. Her paranormal powers are even greater than Dan's. But that's what makes her a perfect prey for a group of psychic vampires called the True Knot. These vampires don't look like Dracula, no fangs or capes, but they appear as boring RV people traveling around. Their leader, Rose the Hat, deposits their victims' steam or psychic gas in canisters she keeps hidden in her Earth Cruiser. She feeds her crew from time to time, when they get hungry and there's a shortage of \\"steamheads\\". Now, their supply is running low and they go after Abra, \\"the mother of all steamheads\\". The girl's shining, especially if extracted by severe torture, will keep them going for a few hundred years at least.<br /><br />Predictably, Dan joins forces with Abra and defeats The True Knot forever and ever.<br /><br />Two aspects of the novel stand out as original: the characterization of the True Knot, and the psychic wars between Abra and Dan on the one hand, and the circle of the True Knot, on the other. King moves away from the image of evil beings roaming the earth under the guise of a traveling carnival; an idea going back at least to Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. King keeps the idea that satanic groups are nomadic, but instead of equating them to the roaring Hell's Angels, he portrays them as the Mild Angels, the placid RV people. They get away with their crimes because they blend perfectly in the environment, nobody pays attention to them:<br /><br />\\"You hardly see them, right? Why would you? They're just the RV People, elderly retirees and a few younger compatriots living their rootless lives on the turnpikes and blue highways, staying at campgrounds where they sit around in their Walmart lawnchairs and cook on their hibachis while they talk about investments and fishing tournaments and hotpot recipes and God knows what. They're the ones who always stop at fleamarkets and yardsales, parking their damn dinosaurs nose-to-tail half on the shoulder and half on the road, so you have to slow to a crawl in order to creep by. They are the opposite of the motorcycle clubs you sometimes see on those same turnpikes and blue highways; the Mild Angels instead of the wild ones.\\"<br />The only difference between this group of vampires and the normal RV people is that vampires don't have dogs.<br /><br />\\"They don't like dogs, and dogs don't like them. You might say dogs see through them. To the sharp and watchful eyes behind the cut-rate sunglasses. To the strong and long-muscled hunters' legs beneath the polyester slacks from Walmart. To the sharp teeth beneath the dentures, waiting to come out. They don't like dogs, but they like certain children. Oh yes, they like certain children very much.\\"<br />That is, tasty children who have the shining, like Abra Stone.<br /><br />King is very inventive in his account of the parapsychological war between Abra Stone and Rose the Hat. Abra is able to jump bodies and see through other people's eyes, while others see through her eyes. This is what she and Dan call turning the wheel. Using this trick, Abra is able to fool Rose the Hat, not once, but twice, by giving her the wrong location. That is, in one instance, Abra jumps into Dan's body and gives Rose the impression she is where Dan is, that is on her way to Colorado, when in fact she's at home in New Hampshire. These mind games are reminiscent of the ones between Jonesy and Mr. Grey in Dreamcatcher.<br /><br />While these aspects of the novel are original and entertaining, the story doesn't have enough emotional depth to make the reader care for the characters. I never cared for Dan Torrence as much as I did for Ralph Roberts in Insomnia, for instance. The depiction of Dan's struggle with alcoholism and with the demons of his dad and the Overlook Hotel is powerful and gripping. But then, we don't know enough about his gift of helping people die peacefully. How did Dan stumble upon this gift and how does it work exactly? Also, how can it go wrong? What if someone doesn't die peacefully? What's so terrible about that? Is the dull red mist that raises from the dead man's head, their soul? Is it going to go to Hell or Purgatory? Or keep roaming the earth aimlessly? If the novel explored this part of the story more, it would have been much better.<br /><br />Similarly, the author doesn't tell us much about the True Knot. And there must be a lot to tell, since they've been around for centuries. They are empty devils, concerned only with staying alive and finding new recruits and having lots of sex. But their characters, including their leader, Rose the Hat, are not really fleshed out. What's it like living such long lives? What keeps them going? What do they believe in? Do they feel loneliness, anxiety, fear? When they die there's no mist hovering above them. Their bodies just disappear. Does that mean they have no souls? King is silent on that point.<br /><br />All in all, one gets the impression that King wanted to fit too much in a book which ended up being about nothing. One reason why the novel doesn't work is that Dan's mysterious ability to help people die peacefully doesn't fit with his helping Abra against the True Knot. The only moment his strange power comes into play in the battle against the Knot is when he manages to trap Abra's great-great-mother cancerous steam in his mind and then release it against the members of the True Knot. But that's just a clever artifice. There's nothing substantial drawing these two essential strands of the book together. Maybe this book should have been two books? Or three books? Either way, on its own, it fails. But it can serve as a reminder of how good other Stephen King books are.
1401322786|5.0|If you only have time to read one more book in 2013, READ THIS BOOK!<br /><br />Beautifully written. Poignant. Life changing.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from the book is \\"A heart weighs more when it splits in two; it crashes in the chest like a broken plane.\\"<br /><br />This is the story of Dor, the first person who attempted to measure time.  And the punishment he must endure for his actions.<br /><br />The ramifications of his actions trickling through humanity. And he must reach out to two people who cry out for more time and less time.<br /><br />The author captures the angst of a teen and the fear of an elderly man so perfectly that the characters live and breathe on the page. As a reader, I identified with all three of the protagonists.<br /><br />It is a brilliantly executed fable that sucks the reader in from the first line and keeps them immersed in the story until the very end.<br /><br />It was one of the most meaningful books I've read and one I think I'll reread in years to come when I need perspective on time and what truly matters in life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My kids are so happy I can play now. Works awesome with my KINDLE FIRE! It is very addicting, but nice to have friends on Facebook to give you extra lives.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I love it but I think there are to  many adds and when I pause it I can't see anything but besides that it is really good!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I think that this game is fun and works really well. It's easy and fun and not hard to control.
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|This is not a negative review because I disagree with the author. On the contrary, I agree with his main premise. My problem is that the premise gets lost in an ocean of &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; verbiage and snarky vitriol against anyone and anything religious.<br /><br />He is also annoying in the way he asks question over and over and over again before he gets to making his point-which he sometimes does not quite make. For example, in the chapter about the various proofs of god, he is all over the place. He starts at one main argument, blows it off in one sentence, as being absurd on its face and then he goes into a long series of anecdotes about conferences he has attended, other comments from other writers, and anything else that apparently popped into his head at the time.<br /><br />Towards the end I started skipping chapters because they were so predictable (I mean how surprised would I be by reading the chapter on religion and homosexuality?)<br /><br />Basically, this book is a long series of stories about how bad religion and religious people are and, sad to say, not much else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super game. So happy to see it available for Kindle! Thanks for bringing it to us finally! Great game play and super graphics.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I avoided this for years because the premise put me off, but I finally gave in because of Edward Norton. No wonder he was cast as the human side of the Hulk. This film IS a film, although its a surrealistic downer in several ways, including the locations involved. Even there, you get a quality eyeful due to the great editing and framing throughout. Its a coherent work sporting some rough messages, but its not for your granny or the kids. I'm not kidding, they'll have seizures, both of 'em. A great story and a good partner for tales like Bobcat Goldthwait's excellent &#34;God Bless America.&#34; Watching it will drain you a little, but not because it lacked character.
B005WKKI96|3.0|It is not Lila Down's most adventurous record so far. She returns to her folkroots, it gives me a been there done that feeling. Still, she remains a marvellous singer.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Good story line. I felt the end was a bit too neat. Story plot was interesting , hence the title.
B0092MIYOQ|5.0|Slayer along with a lot of metal to come out of the 80's the problem of sounding quite dated by today's standards. If a band<br />could survive all sorts of trends and still sound relevant- well my friend, you have just bought one hell of a record. Seasons<br />for me is just that- a good, if not at times GREAT record. Is it the band's greatest work? Helllll no! But in my opinion, it's probably the last of the truly great albums the band has put out. That's not to say they haven't put out their share of good stuff since this one- but it's far few and in between. War Painted Blood for what it is- is a pretty good offering. However in my mind- this album pretty offers the visceral ferocious opener \\"War Ensemble\\" to Midtempo but riff heavy closer \\"Seasons in the abyss\\". And everything in between sticks out in my mind as being pretty awesome. It's something of a masterpiece for these guys- and probably the more varying of work this band has done to my knowledge with this line-up. Thank you Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman (RIP), Tom Ayara, and Dave Lombardo for putting out not one but two great albums: Seasons and Reign In Blood.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Often, \\"classics\\" are dry and a chore to read. This is a true masterpiece, and I am better for reading it.  I highly recommend it to children of all ages.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great acting! Great storyline! Love love love. Can't get enough of this series. I never thought I would love a show that involved such horrible gore.. but I do!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This game is the most fun I have had in years.<br /><br />There is a real storyline (plot), and it is great,<br />with complex levels (realms) to move through and<br />solve one step at a time.<br /><br />The artistic graphics are the most spectacular I<br />have ever seen.  The puzzles are varied, interesting,<br />and challenging (but not so frustrating as to be<br />unsolvable.)<br /><br />I enjoy games that present an alternative world,<br />challenge you to think logically about how to solve<br />each problem presented, but are not so unclear that<br />you cannot figure problems out after thinking<br />carefully about each one.<br /><br />This is a great game, and a good value for the<br />money.<br /><br />Please keep these kind of creative, intelligent &<br />fun games coming, G5 (and BigFish)!<br /><br />Love them!
B000002AZ8|5.0|Nice addition to my collection.  Great to listen to while working.  Need to definitely look for more music from Pearl Jam.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|You have to continue the story! I love the 50 Shades trilogy. I wasn't disappointed with any of the three books.
0394818237|5.0|Got this book to go along with Best Word Book ever, which is a favorite.  My kids can spend so much time looking at these fun pages, and learning!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades Trilogy. I wish it didn't end! If you read the other two, this one is a must.
0307155102|5.0|Got this for 3 year old, because I remember hours of looking at this book as a child. My 3 year old LOVES it, as does my 5 year old.  Educational, imaginative, and fun.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read Gone Girl, sharp objects, and now finished dark places. Although they are all great reads, dark places is my favorite! You won't be disappointed with Gillian Flynn
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I found this movie totally entertaining. It is the kind of movie you can watch multiple times and really enjoy.  It would not be for everyone as you must suspend reality to love it.  People eager for social statement forget this movie.  If you just want to spend a couple hours without any stress at all, watch this movie.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Quick pace with good plot and character development. Plenty of action and thought into how the action moved forward. I enjoyed the ride.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|It looks like Walt!  I bought this primarily for display, so was not concerned that it is not a true &#34;action&#34; figure.  Friends that saw had to have one!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book. It starts a little confusing as the author sorts out the three sets of characters. Very quickly tho the reader is immersed in their stories. I enjoyed spending time with all these characters, each one sympathetic, three dimensional, and all too human. A sensitively drawn portrait of different people in terrible situations and how they learn to go on. Loved it!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|What an amazing movie. I didn't think this movie would interest me but I watched it with my 11 year old daughter and I thought I would end up having to turn it off, but she loved it too. Very well made film and the acting was excellent. Highly recommended!
1444737112|4.0|Bob is quite a cat.  Amazing what all he could do.  Set in England, story gives good insight into drug rehab.  Love forward to more books about Bob.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|For me this is the best album since Figure#5. Stabbing the drama had a couple really good songs, but I'm talking about front to back every song is good album. This is it. Both parts are great and I can listen to both from first to last song. Awesome, best money I have spent in a really, really long time. I can hear the guys souls in this double album. Lots of feel.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I have wanted to be an astronaut since I was a small child... I had a plan... I began private pilot training at the age of 16 and joined the marines at the age of 17... I pursued becoming an officer with hopes to earn my wings, and then pursue a career with NASA as many former Marines do including one of the most famous astronaut  of all, John Glenn!. I eventually decided to settle down and become a family man instead of becoming a astronaut, Such is life... I did not become an astronaut. I left the marines, got married, and now have children of my own with dreams of their own. But I am still a dreamer though, I do still one day hope to experience space! Well I just got to! (the best way available to the average person that is) AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is one word to sum up what I just experienced. My zeal and dreams to go into space have been rekindled to new heights! (no pun intended) and the fact that the acting, plot, score, etc were all incredible is just icing on the cake... but those visuals, the sound effects... WOW... get into your local theater watch this in IMAX 3D and then wait with bated breath for its release on blu-ray 3D and watch it when ever you want! I will likely edit this and add more down the road, but I am going to go and watch Apollo 13! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad it's finally available on Amazon! It helps pass the time. I play it on my lap top, my phone and now my Kindle Fire HD. My name is Jessa and I'm a Candy Crush addict!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show does not need words to rate it. This show has gone viral and everyone is dipping their hands in the cookie jar when it comes to this show. I couldn't wait for the new season to start and I just love this show.
B008EL25LE|5.0|An interesting combination of match 3 and hidden object and an interesting story. The fact that it was the free app of the day makes it an even better deal.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This is a great series. My wife was not that big on it at first, but now she likes it. It shows some truths from history that if you look you can see today.

B000G7PNAE|5.0|There are no words needed to explain this. If you like this age/type of music then the name of the band says it all. Perfect.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was really good because it required you to think. The clues were so varied that you had to rely on your thinking skills. The game was addictive, once I started playing I had to keep going until I got stuck. I'm currently waiting on an update so I can play past the 10th floor.
B006M6VXYS|4.0|There is only one song on this cd that really grabs my attention which is number 3. The downfall with this group is that they can't keep a lead singer.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, especially because of the great older actors!  Can't get better than these guys (and gal)!  Would recommend for anyone who likes a bit of action with some old guys!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is not a show for everyone. If you like fairy tales with twist this would be a show for you. For me it captures my thoughts and makes me think.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting forever for Candy Crush Saga on kindle!! Words can't explain how happy I am :D CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT AGAIN! (I had it on tablet)
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|Words are not really needed. If you like this era of music then you will understand. It is just perfect. Words just can't explain it.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much! Completely addicted and so happy it's on the Kindle Fire now. I have no complaints
B001FVV2X2|5.0|One of the best I've seen for a while. Interesting enough to keep my attention. Like the medical terms and adventure. Really like the characters. Always want to watch the next.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|It's awesome! If anyone who's an Elvis fan doesn't have this one they need to get it. I've just started re-collecting all my Elvis stuff I had on VHS to DVD. All his movies,specials, concerts,Etc. An Amazon has it all. Can't wait to complete my collection. And in the words of the King himself Thank You Very Much.....
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is the one of the best shows I have seen in a while.  Love Sons of Anarchy.<br /><br />Keep making more!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this. This will definitely end my boredom. Thank you its finally available in my kindle. Can't wait for pet rescue.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|I love Toothless/Night Fury. The character has the grace of a manta ray, the mannerism and eyes of a kitty,  plus the sleek design of an axolotl. This mini representation is so precious and even though, yes, I am a full grown gal, I have no shame admitting this lil' cutie brings out the child at heart.
B008M721MS|4.0|Works great, but sometimes drops a video call.....it's good to use for those who are far away and want to keep in contact
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I never got to the movies to see this film as it wasn't out for very long. I suppose the makers of this film felt there wasn't a large enough audience out here for this kind of film. A dear friend raved about what a wonderful story that was being told, so I decided to purchase the CD and I'm saving it for one of those cold, snowy, rainy days to watch it. I can't wait.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|If what happens in this school happened in my kid's school - lawsuit city. The BS is piled so high on this one it smothers the funny.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The movie was entertaining but left me with a few questions.  I'm guessing they left it open for a sequel, which I would watch.  I think it started out a little rough but it got better quickly.  It was the perfect mix of magic, story, and mystery.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|If you have a fear of rats, do not read this.  Imagine being locked up in a cage with rats queuing up.  You can't move in the small cage. So difficult to imagine and so well written.  The mystery unravels slowly, turning many corners. A good read
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Good start, but the &#34;crazy woman&#34; bit wasn't interesting to me. Most interesting part was the basic premise of having a real community of people, including kids, pressed up against the fence of ever-disgusting looking walkers. Also, at last, the threat of disease is a good turn as it's only natural that the water would be contaminated. Like the new characters, keeps things fresh.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Knowledge of how habits work and how you can use them will help you live better and lead better. Duhigg provides the tools and tells a good story
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It made me anxious to read the other two.  it was excellent.  I may even see the movie, but I believe books are always better.
0756697875|5.0|My boys (8 and 6) are Lego addicts.  They love this book.  I find my son in bed with the flashlight several nights a week.  Makes a great birthday present.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|You can call me a fantasy &#34;newbie&#34; as the only other book that I have read (Game of Thrones-wickedly good) but still have not finished.  The book is awesome but I am intimidated by 4 other books in this series so I guess I am prolonging dedicating myself to that long of a series although I love and embrace huge books.<br /><br />When I saw Brandon Sanderson's (BS) The Way of Kings, I picked it up because it seemed like it was a standalone.  I AM WRONG.  I believe this is going to be a 10 book series.  I read that Sanderson had finished the Wheel of Time series since the author died.  I thought that if he could finish what someone else wrote and get great reviews then his story should be that much better.  It is.  I have never read anything like it.  I love the concept of the Stormlight, Shard Blades, Thunderclast, Winspren and so much more.  I have to confess that since I have started this book, it is the only book I am reading and housework is getting neglected.  I won't go into details about the story since you probably have read the other reviews and know what this series is all about.<br /><br />This book which is the first of ten is over 1,100 pages and it truly boggles my mind how BS is going to keep the story going for another nine books.  I think you have to be a creative genius to keep ALL that information bottled in the brain.<br /><br />With that being said, I have to get back to my book.  I will say the first hundred pages are difficult because you are experiencing a world that BS has created when he first thought of this book.  Even if it is difficult because there are so many things going on and the story flips back and forth with time and the characters, I did not get bored and neither will you, should you decide to purchase it.  That is how good this book is.<br /><br />Since I am new to the fantasy, I would really appreciate comments on this book.  Am I the only one that is impressed with the world, human and creatures that Brandon Sanderson has created?<br /><br />UPDATED AS OF 6/7/15<br />Excellent book.  For those who have never read Brandon Sanderson, you are really missing out.  All his story have such fantastical elements to them that you will become an instant fan.  No disrespect intended but any of those people who compare him to G. R. R. Martin or Robert Jordan should read all of his books because Brandon (IMHO) is way better than the aforementioned authors.  Although I must say that I do love GRRM's Game of Throne series.  Phenomenal series.  As for Robert Jordan, I know he must be a great author but I can't seem to get into his series - The Wheel of Time.  However, I will give it another try.  Right now I am &#34;crushing on Brandon Sanderson&#34; and I have almost all his books.  The thing I love about Brandon is that he writes fast, he writes such entertaining stories and they are all so different and unique.  What more can you ask for in a sci fi author.  Oh and he is also one of those authors that actually responds to emails.  It may take him time but he did respond to mine and for that, he has endeared himself to me.llent book.  For those who have never read Brandon Sanderson, you are really missing out.  All his story have such fantastical elements to them that you will become an instant fan.  No disrespect intended but any of those people who compare him to G. R. R. Martin or Robert Jordan should read all of his books because Brandon (IMHO) is way better than the aforementioned authors.  Although I must say that I do love GRRM's Game of Throne series.  Phenomenal series.  As for Robert Jordan, I know he must be a great author but I can't seem to get into his series - The Wheel of Time.  However, I will give it another try.

B00C6BB2JE|4.0|This is a great movie that I purchase for a gift. It came in a metal case with a rustic look, which goes right along with the movie's environment. A good purchase, especially if you're buying this movie as a gift as the packaging of the product is unique.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm reading chapter 10 and honestly I'm not very impressed. The story traps you but the way the main character is so controlling is almost not healthy.  I don't know what's ahead I'm still reading to see how the story evolves.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I ALWAYS LOVED THE ORIGINAL STAR TREK.  HAVING THE CHANCE TO SEE ALL THREE SEASONS AGAIN IS A DEFINATE TRILL.  I AM CYRRENTLY AT THE END OF SEASON TWO AND LOOKING FORWARD SEASON THREE. TO ME, THE ORIGINAL IS THE BEST.

B00E5UEA4I|5.0|If you've come to love KT for her high-energy, rockin' tunes like &#34;Black Horse,&#34; &#34;Push That Knot Away,&#34; or &#34;Hold On,&#34; you might find this album to be a little slow. But KT is a master songwriter, and she has gone above and beyond with this album. It's reflective, poignant, and often heart-breakingly honest. I will admit that it took several listens for me to truly appreciate the beauty of this album, but it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />Check out &#34;Invisible Empire,&#34; &#34;Yellow Flower,&#34; &#34;Made of Glass,&#34; and &#34;Feel It All.&#34; If you spring for the deluxe version, (and you should!), check out &#34;Hallowed Ground,&#34; (pretty rockin'!), and her cover of &#34;Boys Of Summer.&#34;<br /><br />A beautiful and haunting album that will stay with you. Cheers, KT. :)

B00A2H9WW8|1.0|Since I am such a huge fan of the original &#34;Carrie,&#34; I went into this movie with tempered expectations.  Boy, was that a good move.  The latest remake was a HUGE disappointment.  I almost left before the ending, but decided I'd already been tortured for over 90 minutes, so I'd just buck up and try and stomach the rest.  I am amazed by the other reviews; however, after this movie has been in circulation a little while, I don't believe anyone will find it still being rated as a 4-1/2 star movie.<br /><br />&#34;Carrie&#34; tells the tale of a young girl with special powers, i.e. telekenisis (the power to move objects by force of the mind).  Constantly tortured by an over-protective, uber-religious mother--not to mention just about an entire high school--Carrie dreads just about every day of her life...until she discovers her power.  After that, Carrie feels a little more focus in her life; she has something no other teenager in her school possesses, and she doesn't feel so helpless anymore.  After a very ugly scene is posted on the internet involving Carrie and her &#34;becoming a woman,&#34; one girl feels the need to try and help Carrie fit in.  This turns out to be the worst thing for everyone involved.<br /><br />Most of you know the rest of the story.  Scenes in the original that were poignant, tender, and so meaningful have been replaced with hurried attempts to tell a story--and LOTS of CGI.  Although Chloe Grace Moretz does a decent job as the title character, it is the rest of her cast that do this movie in.  Julieanne Moore was an absolute train wreck as her mother.  Her character portrayal was lifeless.  I'll take Piper Laurie's over-the-top portrayal anytime over the zombie-like mumblings of Moore.  I could compare (character for character) the 1976 version to this remake, and there was not ONE actor who came close to hitting the marks of the original.<br /><br />&#34;Carrie&#34; will hopefully die a quick death.  This should be a lesson to all the morons in Hollywood who continue to think they are capable of outdoing a classic.  It will never work, so STOP already.  &#34;Carrie&#34; is rated R for violence and language, and was directed by Kimberly Pierce.

B005MMY534|4.0|I like the cast and a different take on camelot story. I really enjoyed jamie campbell bower  as auther. Until I saw him in the mortal instruments as jace I didnt know  of him as an actor. So I looked up his films to see what else he has starred in and discovered camelot and I enjoy the chemistry with all charecters. I look forward to future projects. I really hope for the second story to mortal instruments but I understand that its been canceled . Disappointed.  Camolot is awsome though !

1476727651|4.0|Several positives struck me about this book.  The book is fantasy, of course, but King weaves many real things into it.  One is Alcoholics Anonymous, which has played a role in King's own life.  Writers should focus on what they personally know.  The meetings, members, and credo of AA are excellently and convincingly rendered.  This is very integral to the story, not something hung on like a Christmas tree ornament.  In fact, Dan's immersion in AA provides him with insights and tools to survive in his battle with the True Knot.<br /><br />Dan is the link with King's earlier novel, \\"The Shining.\\"  He was the boy in that novel, and the focus of that novel.  His flashback recollections of his nightmarish time at the Overlook Hotel show the reader that Dan -- whatever else he is -- has become an expert on evil.  Some \\"turns\\" occur, where the monstrous entities from the Shining actually are put into play against the True Knot.<br /><br />Speaking of that, the True Knot are a very original and creative source of evil.  They may owe something to vampirism and other legends, but I have never encountered anything quite like them.  The worst of them, such as Crow Daddy or Rose the Hat, emerge as pretty convincing characters.  As the backstory emerges for Rose, she is seen as a centuries old Lamia.  She possesses human emotions such as vanity, malice, vindictiveness, and rage.  She also is motivated by love and grief.<br /><br />How many of us have seen photos of abducted kids pinned up in WalMart or displayed on the back of milk cartons?  King is excellent at taking such common experiences of daily life, weaving them into the book to make the totally implausible seem convincing.<br /><br />Possibly the most interesting character in the story is Abra, a precocious kid of 13 who possesses extraordinary psychic abilities.  Dan says at one point, \\"I am a flashlight, but Abra is a lighthouse.\\"  Dan is her ally, guide, and mentor.  He combines his deep understanding of evil with her remarkable psychic power.  Together, they stand against the demonic forces of the True Knot.<br /><br />Other characters come out pretty well designed.  Billy is a brave old Senior Citizen who plays a major part.  Abra's parents, Dave and Lucy, are pretty well developed also.<br /><br />One great writer said that all successful novels link to character development.  Doesn't matter.  Horror novels, sci-fi novels, or even \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.\\"  This book is well plotted and well paced.  But King's characters really bring it to life.r remarkable psychic power.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|This is a great album.  Gary Clark Jr. is a very talented artist.  The song &#34;When my train pulls in&#34; is worth the cost of the album by itself.  In fact, the song is almost too good.

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I've been listening to this CD ever since I received it.  The tone and pace of the songs vary and the arrangements are lovely.  Some of the songs are old favorites (September Morning and La Vie en Rose) and some are new to me.  Whether in English, French or Italian, they're all wonderful.  Andrea Bocelli is easy to listen to and leaves you in a positive frame of mind.<br /><br />The CD arrived quickly in perfect condition.  The transaction was problem-free.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book was captivating and kept me wanting to get back to it to see what would happen next. The interesting aspect was the cultural background of the countries involved in the developing social and political changes that were occurring.<br /><br />The fictional characters and their developing circumstances were a bit far fetched but certainly interesting.<br /><br />I was interested from a historical perspective, and the fictional characters made the details of the political developments much more interesting than a detailed fact based approach.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yes, little DannyTorrance is back as a young man with that very interesting past. he starts a new path. and yet is still very connected to the old one.... Stephen creates a new world for us, within one we might trust, and never suspect of its evil. I wasn't going to get an RV anyway.... see for yourself, you'lll love it!

Outstanding well written page turning book!  Highly recommended.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|I am 30, work full time as an RN, am married and have two kids.  I have many busy days, and sleepless nights, but after reading some of her book I almost feel like I am not doing enough because I'm not CEO of some company.<br /><br />Some parts were inspiring for me like when she writes about how women more easily doubt their abilities and thus hold themselves back from opportunities and advancements.  What I got out of that was it's not just about how smart you are or how hard you work, but it is so important to believe in yourself and be confident.  That might be an obvious message for some, but for me the way she put it really made sense.<br /><br />Being a mother, a wife, holding a pink collar job like nursing,  or just being a woman and being good at those things is are very important jobs that don't always get the repecf and praise they deserve.  The world should recognize that more and treat women better in the first place instead of taking those roles for granted.<br /><br />Also, she works for Facebook! Yes,  it's a very successful networking site, but are we all better off because of it or is it just another time suck out of our day that's making us all more ADD.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Great. I expected nothing less from a director like Guillermo del Toro. Great f/x great story and a perfect cast.

There were portion  of the novel that needed some modification for my three year old, but the story proved as wondrous to her as it did to me the first time I read it. All of Gaiman's works are wonderfully perfect for the adult reader and young reader alike.

B00DM12ANO|5.0|I'm a sucker for Sci-fi movies so when I saw the preview for this I was a little skeptical. You have to suspend your belief a little to allow for two planets orbiting one another yet not moving in a customary rotation. That said, lets pretend. This is a basically a love story disguised as a sci-fi movie. The visual effects of an upside down world really are spectacular and this will be one to eventually buy. The story line flows pretty good and you actually end up rooting for the two lovers beating the system. This system juxtapositions the two worlds of haves and have nots and keeping each in their own place. Of course, our two lovers happen to be on opposite sides of the system (worlds) and must fight the powers that be to fulfill their love. For true sci-fi fans, you won't be disappointed. Its an original premise and a great movie.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Man of Steel weas boring and one of the reasons is the casting.  IMO the only casting they got right was Russell Crowe as Jor-El, and Michael Shannon as General Zod.  Other cast members are forgettable, and I wish I could forget them.  The movie was too serious and I did not laugh once.  What happened to fun and romance?  I expect a Batman movie to be dark and serious, but not Superman.  The final straw for me was the endless violence, and over the top CGI.  I expect a Superman movie to be a lot more than just AVERAGE.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|Very disappointing third installment. The whole premise of the first two movies was waking up the next day and not knowing what happened the night before. This installment had none of that. Without giving away any details, suffice it to say that part 3 chugged along with no real depth of story other than chasing the money. Slow and boring and never really grabs you into the plot.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I loved it. Didn't think I would like it but it was really good a I did a marathon of 5 yrs. I loved it. Truned all my friends on to it and they loved it. Glad I watched it.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|I have to say, this movie is really good. Just when you think the movie is over, it's just beginning. Story is good even for adults and the Giants are amazing. This is one that you need to buy and keep in your collection.
B00CJGP116|5.0|excellent and handy. fast delivery<br />i love the amazon apps . i can play my song everywhere. my wife love it
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I had so much high hopes for this one and was looking forward to a great Zombie movie. As a fan of the Walking Dead, I was looking forward to at least something on par with this TV show. Sadly, this movie lacked background, purpose and a plot. Brad Pitt has never been one of my favorite actors but even his performance was sub-par in this one. The story never pulls you in. Things are happening with no explanation and the plot makes no sense. I think some in hollywood simply think that putting zombies into a movie equals success. Nope. What makes The Walking Dead so successful isn't the Zombies. Its character development and the human condition surrounding the end of the world. This movie lacks all of that and simply has Brad running here, there and everywhere as some sort of &#34;expert?&#34; that is never really explained.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Steps we've all heard presented in a very tangible, doable way!!! By far a most valuable addition to my collection
B00F9040HU|3.0|Game is fun, but you are prompted to purchase full version after competing certain level. You can go no further in the game without making the purchase. Don't be fooled by &#34;free&#34; game.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|A wonderfully artful experience! I honestly don't think there is anything I don't like about this album. It has a great storytelling feel and poetically visual.
B00BXHLM9W|5.0|I had to do it....I bought the vinyl version.  What fun to spin vinyl again and hear these incredible tunes blasting from my speakers!  The quality of the vinyl, by the way, is top notch.  No more than 4 tracks per side.  Anyone who knows CCR records from Fantasy, with such thin vinyl that it compared unfavorably with a burrito shell, will be pleased.<br /><br />The songs sound so good because it's obvious Fogerty had a good time doing this; the guest musicians sound that way, too, and not like a bunch of groupies playing an icon's tunes.  Keith Urban never sounded better; and if you don't know Foo Fighters, you certainly will after hearing the searing opening track!

B006LSZECO|2.0|NOT a mystery, not a thiller, just a sad tale of a marriage between dysfunctional people finding their best lows to crawl through life. Clever plotting, odd people, but untimately all cliche and very little substance. A lot like 50 Shades of Gray in that it is cashing in on a trend, not very original and ultimately a bore. Right after I finished this tedious book, I got a Dashiell Hammet mystery to clear my literary pallate, and that was very refreshing!<br /><br />I think &#34;Chick Lit&#34; is a demeaning term, but it fits this dreary novel perfectly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is highly recommended. You can get it on almost any device. It only takes a litt l e bit to download and they change it all the time(in a good way)
0345803485|1.0|This book is not worth talking about, so just a warning and maybe a plea. Please don't read this disgusting junk. I wanted to see what all the hype was about since they want to make it into a movie. It is insulting and abusive to men and women
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Steal like an artist is a book by Austin Kleon that changed our paradigm about stealing. His particular theme is that if you steal from one it is called plagiarism, if you still from many it is called research. Most of the artists proclaim of nobel ideas and movement yet those were already created by artists before only they don't know about it. Thus, creating is not from nothing into something but bringing into existence from something things that did not exist before. A great insight however he might encourage artists to steal and copy only and not to exert effort. I believe that artists should combine all ideas either new or old. A great book
B001QWBM62|4.0|could be smaller and soon will be, for now a very handy sound recording tool at a really decent price.
B00FKE3H0G|4.0|I have to say I am shocked on how good this album is! She is a great singer love her voice! If you like Miley you will not be disappointed!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Works well, got shafted on a used one. I would not buy used. The battery life on the used one my wife bought was terrible. it cannot even hold a charge so it always has to be plugged in.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works very well sharpens all types of knives, would buy again! great for gifts for the marine in the family. lives up to its name.......
B004GTKP3S|5.0|This short series brought sadness and joy while following the lives of the townspeople through good and troubled times. Sweet series that culminates with happy endings.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Every songs shows a great evolution since The Slip. A great step into NIN history. Absolutely, buy it. NIN is anger under control.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is such a great western and the directors cut is something that I didn't know if I would need or not.  It is worth the extra that I paid for it and will stay with me for a long time.
B00FIYFQ20|4.0|It's a good album overall but has a little too much of an 80s feel to it at times. The album makes up for it by being intense, heavy and fast.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read. Unusual plot that keeps you wondering how its all going to turn out. Highly recommend this book to all married women.
B00FFL8ZMY|4.0|This is the heaviest album so far, Tremonti really brings in his metal influences hard on guitar.  He truly shows his talent and ability.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|this album is off the chainz doe!! I have to be honest this is one of the best albums i ever heard! i keep replaying this over and over!!!
0525953728|4.0|I really enjoyed the book; very detailed and easy to read.  Probably laid out more detail about the attack than any article I've read, and the author didn't have any reason to embellish anything.  I appreciated the diagrams to help with envisioning the procedures during the actual attack.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I lived there for five years and I never knew the entire story of the Muscle Shoals Sound. It is still a wonderful place to visit friends. My son was born there. He now lives across country but I have linked him to this movie. It is a must see.
0393330435|3.0|I was really excited to read this book and was looking forward to an opportunity to get inside the head and life of one of the greatest innovators of our time.  Perhaps this book would better categorized as a \\"collection of achievements and pranks\\" rather than an autobiography.  There's no doubt that this is a great man, but the book doesn't do him justice.  I'm not sure what the focus of the book was meant to be.  After five chapters I was disappointed that I was STILL reading about how he was far smarter than everyone around him and how he would take great pleasure in secretly pranking people.  It seemed like I was listening to him tell funny stories, with no real overarching theme or valuable take-aways.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I think the media played it up to be more exciting than it was. I'm glad I waited till it was out on DVD. Maybe in the cinema it may have been better due to the large screen. I will buy the dvd to have on hand as other family members have not seen it yet but seriously....it did not blow my socks of so to speak.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I have never been a huge Superman fan. I tended to lean more toward X-men and Batman. I am also, admittedly, not a huge movie goer. And I never see movies in a theater twice. The last time was to see the first Pirates of the Caribbean.<br /><br />I saw Man of Steel because I was trying to see a movie with my two sons (ages 20 and 17) within a limited amount of time, and both Into Darkness and Ironman 3 started too late for our schedule. I figured, whatever, we'll just go watch Man of Steel since none of us have seen it yet.<br /><br />I was pretty well blown away. This film is so well cast it's ridiculous. There was no one in the film who was miscast, including Amy Adams, of whom I an not a fan. The choices for both sets of parents (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer on Krypton and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane on Earth) were spot on. Henry Cavill was born for this role.<br /><br />There are a few things in the movie that are out of place with the comics, but the changes all make sense and don't ruin the story. Everything is well explained but is not glaringly obvious. The goals for Kal-El/Clark Kent by his two fathers works to shape him. It seems they work at cross purposes, and yet, neither of them is wrong.<br /><br />About a week and a half after I saw this with my sons, I was sitting at a restaurant with my younger son and we had a conversation that went something like this:<br /><br />Me: I seriously can't get Man of Steel out of my head. It was an incredibly movie. I'm seriously thinking of hitting a theater and seeing it again.<br /><br />Son: There's a theater two blocks over and if you catch the first showing it's only $7. Man of Steel starts in 40 minutes.<br /><br />Less than an hour later, I found myself sitting in a darkened theater waiting for the movie to start. It's that good. And it was that good the second time around. If I had to find a complaint, it would be that there was nowhere near enough Russell Crowe for my taste.<br /><br />This movie will besitting on my shelf when it finally comes out.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great flick  good action would recommend watching. Watch twice even for what you miss  had to type too many words hahahha
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally the actual Candy Crush game!<br />Love playing in the 7&quot; screen, instead of the phone. Runs smoothly. A+ in my book!!
083205416X|5.0|I received this used book from Amazon.com.promptly and in good shape. I have always wanted to read the Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck but just never did.  I am about half way through and am really enjoying it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you love hidden object games you will enjoy this game.  It is really easy to level up when you complete the quests.  I have been playing for about a month and I am already at level 33.  It does sometime take a while for your energy to restore but if you just pull up the game to get your rewards when you may not have time to play you can gather a lot of energy.  You don't been have to connected to the internet to play.

B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Fantastic sequel to The Shining. I didn't believe I would enjoy it as much as I loved the original but I did - it was a fitting continuation of the story.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I had a fun time watching this movie.  It's easy to watch, easy to follow and pretty fun in general.  Nothing earth shattering, but worth a watch!
140006922X|5.0|This book is not a fast read!  It is a thought provoking read!  I enjoy historical literature and this was one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really really really LOVE this app. It is addictive ( as you can see) but I love it and it is very challenging. I play it everyday day and I can't hardly wait for some lives to hurry and come in so I can play as many levels as I would like to play in a day without messing up!!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like the fact that if you are patient you do not have to spend any money. This game is fun to play. I am still in the beginning levels and it is a little bit challenging. Overall great game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Justice is achieved in this wonderful story by John Gresham . I would recommend this to everyone that loves Gresham.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. What an amazing, heart-wrenching story! This is my first Colleen Hoover book, and I absolutely loved it. I love her writing, and how she's able to weave such a gripping, intricate story in a way that meshes perfectly together at the end. Although predictable plot, her characters are likable and Holden, oh my Goodness, Dean Holden is downright lovable! I love him, and I absolutely love how he loves Sky with his entire being. Heart-wrenching and painful to read at times, I found myself enthralled and unable to put the book down. I am now officially a Colleen Hoover fan ❤. Highly recommend this book ;).
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I could not put this book down. I loved the excitement, the love story, the happy ending, everything about it. I look forward to reading more of this series.

031623480X|5.0|The link between diet and brain health is established in this easy to read book. I have followed the recommendations for about 6 weeks and see improvement in memory and clarity of thinking. I've lost 3 or 4 pounds as well even though I wasn't overweight to start.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is filled with adventure and excitement with a bitter sweet ending. I definitely recommend reading this good book
B007EECSFA|4.0|We read this for my book club.  At first I wasn't sure if I would start (or finish) based the the length of the book.  But I kept at it and was told that it was worth finishing it.  I'm glad I did.  It takes a while to get to the twist and turns as the reader really wants to know what the secret is.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I was never able to download it..:&#34;( why am I being required to write so many words to say I wasn't able to down load the book....damn really
B00D48BSBA|3.0|It was a good read. Decent novel. It was quite fast paced. I would read again if given a chance.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This is another great Miyazaki movie.  My wife and I loved this one and definitely recommend it.  We're very happy with the purchase of this film.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|A good movie on several levels--sympathy for the underdog, compassion for the mentally retarded, suspense. These factors are perennial, and I enjoy the fim every time I see it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THANK YOU AMAZON for finally releasing this for us loyal Kindle Fire owners..my family has been waiting forever. Anyhow,game is strangely addictive, colorful,not too easy not to difficult. The graphics during storyline are unique with paper cut out effect which is also,strangely entertaining. If you are a fan of match 3 and playing to help and be helped by your Facebook fans, then you'll love this game..watch out though, might make your sweet tooth raise its ugly head :) (I think you may be able to play without Facebook,but you'll need your friends help as you progress )
B00EBDXT9G|5.0|Though my opinion of the music on this album is quite high, much has been said of it by others already. As such I feel that my time would be better spent defining the differences between this and the slightly older Elektra release of the Album and reviewing them.<br /><br />The difference is: &#34;Not much at all,&#34; and my review is: &#34; Since this is replacing the Elektra version entirely, that's arguably a good thing.&#34;<br /><br />Let's face it; few things are more annoying than buying a movie or a CD at full retail price, and then having a new edition released that is cheaper, shinier, or (in some cases) having the level of quality and content that the one you originally purchased SHOULD have had to begin with. Fortunately for those feeling that way, when Metallica bought the rights to their older material off Elektra and went independent under the &#34;Blackened Records&#34; label, they elected to take a less-is-more approach to reissuing their classic albums.<br /><br />So this edition doesn't boast expanded track lists, or &#34;remastered&#34; works; in fact they are Identical to their Elektra counterparts in every way. After all what really needs to be changed? The album is a classic and the recording snafus that have been part of it since release are a piece of its legacy and icon.<br /><br />It even comes complete with the classic (or &#34;Cheap&#34; if you're a cynic) black-ridged CD case so it'll fit right in next to that old copy of &#34;Master of Puppets&#34; on your shelf if you're buying the physical copy.<br /><br />So what HAS changed? Well, there's now a little &#34;Blackened Records&#34; logo where &#34;Elektra&#34; was once emblazoned and (possibly) there has been some color correction to the album cover, though I don't have an Elektra copy sitting around to compare.<br /><br />Oh, its MSRP is also slightly cheaper than the Elektra version was, which is always a plus.<br /><br />While I'm sure some people will lament that Metallica didn't take this opportunity to attempt restoring Newstead's largely muted bass track, or conjuring up the lost ambient mic recordings from Ulrich's drumming, one can't help but wonder if these songs might not sound strange with these things added in. (At least in the case of Newstead's Bass, there's an unfortunate technical reason it's not in full force on the master recordings, or so I've read...)<br /><br />So, Long Story Short: If you haven't yet added &#34;Justice&#34; to your CD collection this is a great time to do so at a more reasonable and modern CD price. (And if you're weird like me, you'll like that the case will match any older versions of Metallica's Albums that you might already have.)<br /><br />If you already own it? You don't have to fear that you've missed out on anything. Win-Win, I say.take this opportunity to attempt restoring Newstead's largely muted bass track, or conjuring up the lost ambient mic recordings from Ulrich's drumming, one can't help but wonder if these songs might not sound strange with these things added in.

B000P407K4|5.0|Peter Sellers is unmatchable in THREE roles!! To make this commentary on the insanity of nuclear weapons at the height of the cold war (I was a cold war warrior IN the USAF SAC in B-58 nuclear weapons system delivery) was unpopular with the &#34;red/white/blue&#34; folks but very popular in the counter culture world. Great movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is the best book ever it is so awesome that I read it 9 times and no skipping pages
B0063GORYU|4.0|Not bad but the commercials drive me crazy. But you can't beat it for free . I really like it better than several that i have paid money for.
B00B3VB9TQ|5.0|Tally is just another Ugly, another person waiting for the day they turn 16 to take the operation that will switch them from Ugly to Pretty. Tally's best friend is just over three months older than her, Peris was turned pretty a while ago, born at the end of the year Tally has no friends left, they've all moved to New Pretty Town and she's just counting down the days till she joins them. She soon stumbles upon another girl that has been left behind, all her friends are older too and have also moved, Shay and Tally seem to do everything together now, just waiting for the day to come so they don't have to be alone anymore. However when Shay runs away before her birthday Tally is sent on the job with one condition. If she doesn't find her Tally will never be pretty. What Tally discovers in the outside world surprises her though and may even make her question her own thoughts on being Pretty.<br /><br />This novel is fairly old now, published back in 2005, however due to the current hype of the dystopian genre it has been gathering more interest lately. Tally isn't necessarily the most likeable of characters which make me like her even more. The plot is very gripping and sucks you into the book with ease. You can feel the frustration of the characters and the suspicions they hold. The whole book, from front to back, seems to flow happily and suspense as to what's going to happen is almost mind-boggiling. The cliffhanger that you are given at the end makes you want to pick up the next book as soon as you have finished the first.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Hunger games or Divergent or even people who just want to read a good book
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartwarming story with an interesting twist.  A friend of mine recommended it and she was spot on.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002TZ3C6I|4.0|Zoey Redbird is just an average girl, she goes to school, worries about geometry, has boy drama, the whole lot. However one day her seemingly normal life changes when she is marked at school, now no-one will treat her the same and she must go to the house of night. A vampire training school, or she will die. Lots of drama at her new `school' as well as boys, cats and a whole lot of weirdness packs you in for a treat.<br /><br />Marked is the first book in a long series by P.C. and Kristin Cast, it follows the Journey of Zoey and her friends at the House of Night. I enjoyed the plot to this book, there was lots of things to think about and always stuff happening to keep you entertained. The characters each have great personalities and the whole group works well together as well as the other characters that aren't featured as much. It's nice to read a vampire book that's a bit different from the rest and this is definitely that<br /><br />If you do like vampires or supernaturals or even just want a fun read then i would really recommend this book
B00003CXRM|5.0|What a great movie !  Funny and has a great sound track.  Alison Kraus and the Union Station did most of the music.<br />Really entertaining.
1439152810|5.0|This book was the first book I read from this author. This book was so good I will read her other books!
B00008G7UF|5.0|I did not know how I was going to like Meg Ryan starring with Kevin Kline because I had not seen him in film before. I was used to her with Tom Hanks, but when I watched her and Kevin Kline together it was something that I had not expected. They were wonderful and his French accent was terrific.<br /><br />I wanted to watch another movie with Kevin Kline but I did not like the part he played in this other film after viewing him as an unkept Frenchman. Seeing him in dress attire was so different and I was not ready for that. But, I really like Kevin and hope that I can watch another one of his movies and enjoy it as much as I did French Kiss.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing book. Makes you want to keep reading. I couldn't put it down. Love it so much. I would recommend this book to everyone

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of my favorites.  Love the costumes. It is a refreshing change from reality shows and other current tv programs. Can't wait until new season starts.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is an excellent choice.  It is thin and light weight; the texture is easily gripped and feels secure; the Kindle snaps tightly into the case and does not move around in the case which makes the Kindle as easy to handle as without a protective case.  While I haven't dropped the device just to test the case, I am sure that it will afford way more protection than dropping an unprotected Kindle.  The seller did an acceptable job on delivery, but I've had far better response from some other sellers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a cute way to spend some free time! Fun and easy to love!!! I would recommend it to all minion lovers in the world.
0812982622|5.0|I was drawn in from the first chapter. The main subject, Pak Jun Do, evolved from a cog in the machine, to an extraordinary individual in a country that will &#34;cancel&#34;  anyone, for anything. This novel was haunting and all my senses came alive with every page.  I can understand why the author won the Pulitzer. He most certainly deserved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game. Finally decided that the time outs are a good thing because they give me a moment to do other things.  Lol. So happy you FINALLY created the app for the kindle Fire. Ive been looking for it daily!  Thank you ...love it!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|The story has funny parts and drama as well.  Chris Hemsworth is good in the title role along with Natalie Portman.  This is a prequel to the Avengers.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|It didn't seem like a lot of time was spent on this novel. It could have used more factual detail and character development. I also wish that more detail had been included about the legal proceedings. Still, the story was interesting.
B007V80WUC|4.0|This band, afaik, used to be a Dream Theater cover band. So it's probably no surprise that when you listen to this you'll hear many of the same styles used by Dream Theater, like the synth and guitar playing high speed notes in unison. In fact, for their first two albums I would have said that they were just another Dream Theater clone. On this album, however, they strike out more on their own style, and each song is more memorable than the previous albums. That said, I'm not entirely sure they have found their own style yet, but I bet their next album will be see a huge growth based on how much they grew from their last album.
B003WTE886|5.0|This is different as far as writing on the newer RED CD but I still enjoy it a great deal. A little more country flavor and with her awesome writing and vocals, anyone who likes Taylor needs to get this cd
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Amazing series! I can't wait to get the second season. I recommend this to anyone! I'm also trying to read all the books in the series. Watch it!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our all-time FAVORITE movie to watch every Christmas season as a family.  We never fail to feel lifted from the fast-paced pressures of the holidays by watching this movie.
1401917232|5.0|It doesn't surpass DU as my favorite, but it's a great conclusion to the trilogy. Gary and his teachers present a lot of the same teachings in new ways, as well as highlighting some forgiveness techniques. Much more of the teaching in this book comes from Gary, as opposed to DU and YIR, where Gary mostly presented the information provided by his teachers. Gary also elaborates more on his life story and forgiveness lessons.<br /><br />I've seen some negative reviews in which people claim that Gary talks too much about himself. Given that he writes books about the teachings of ACIM and how he applies them to his own forgiveness lessons, I would argue that this is to be expected. Sure, he shows some judgment towards other ACIM teachers. None of us are perfect (well, we are, but you know what I mean). There is a lot of good information and motivation to be found in this book to readers who are willing to forgive the parts that they don't personally favor.
1451695187|5.0|And a friend recommended this book.  It's written by a neurologist, who scientifically did not believe in an afterlife.  Then he had a life changing experience, and went to the other side an back.  He tells his story so well, and it is comforting to know the people and pets you have loved will be there.  I have not finished it yet, but it is my primary read right now.  Also, it arrived in good shape and on time.
B00E6F15HM|5.0|Gabriel and band in fine form. He's weird, his dancing is odd, but the songs are perfect as well as the subtle performances of this top-notch band.<br /><br />Gabriel's voice is perfect as a vessel of a wonderous array of emotions.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I believe this game is worth $10.00! I would totally recommend this game to all my relatives and friends! Highly worth the wait for Quell: Memento.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|It is the one of the best Disney movies that my daughter loves. She can watch it over and over.
B00FFL8ZMY|3.0|Alter Bridge was one of the first bands I really started to follow and listen to on a regular basis. There first two albums are still some of my favorites to listen to. (So much so that the first track on my copy of Blackbird (Ties that Bind) won't even play properly anymore) That being said, I wasn't exactly as big a fan of AB.III as I was there first two albums. Sure, AB.III had a lot of good stuff on it, but it just seemed a little too much like Blackbird in a repetitive way.<br /><br />Being a fan, I was excited to hear a fourth album was coming out of course. However, I only once listened to their pre-album release single on You Tube, \\"Addicted to Pain\\", and I have to say, I just was not impressed by it. Something about it that I still can not put my finger on, but I just don't enjoy the song like I do most of Alter Bridge's previous releases. Of course, I hoped the majority of the album would be better... sadly, it wasn't the case...<br /><br />I don't know what it is about Fortress, but I just don't enjoy the stuff like I do their original stuff for the most part. The only song I really like off the album is \\"Cry Me A River\\" which has a catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head. If all the tracks off Fortress were like \\"Cry Me A River\\" I'm sure I'd have loved the album. But alas, I don't know exactly what it is, but this one was a bit of a let down for me. It's okay, but it just sounds like the same old stuff you heard on AB.III without any of the heart. I think they should have waited a few more years before releasing another album, because part of me says it was too soon after AB.III to give them any time to do something \\"great\\", especially since in between AB.III and this, Mark Tremonti went off to make a solo album that almost puts Alter Bridge's entire works to shame. (Which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who loves Blackbird, because it will blow you out of the water)<br /><br />I really wanted to like it; the cover art is awesome; there's a few really good songs like \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Cry of Achilles\\" (which by the way, has nothing to do with the figure from Mythology at all) but let's just say I won't be sticking songs like \\"Addicted to Pain\\" or \\"Peace is Broken\\" in my Alter Bridge Best Of playlists.y good songs like \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Cry of Achilles\\" (which by the way, has nothing to do with the figure from Mythology at all) but let's just say I won't be sticking songs like \\"Addicted to Pain\\" or \\"Peace is Broken\\" in my Alter Bridge Best Of playlists.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I give this game five stars because this game is really challenging for kids and adults too. That's why I got this game you guys or girls should try it you will l love it.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|In world where Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Kim Kardashian are revered, why I am surprised that a movie like this gets 4 stars! Seriously this movie was horrible and the ending WOW!!!<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, what the hell happened to you?<br /><br />Mark, did you do this movie to even up with the great indie movies you have done?<br /><br />It bothers me that this movie has a sequel in the works while kids go hungry...
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app is great only problem is that amazon should make it be able to open kik cards from other people
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|It is not the season yet but I know my grandchildren will love this. They have all the Lego Friends so far. It is great Lego started to produce items besides Starwars and battle items.

B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I have been waiting for another game from Fire Maple.  As soon as I saw this app I had to buy it.  It ran with no flaws on my generation one Kindle Fire.  I had to use my brain on this game.  Chided myself for not seeing the obvious or being able to figure out the next step.  I agree with the reviewer who said to be patient - all will come to you.  The graphics are the best of any other game.  The back ground music is soothing which helps to relax.  Puzzles are fierce and require some brain power.  Buy this exciting game and enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played on my mom's I pad It fanially got on here. And I got it the first second I saw it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|well done, transporting the reader completely into will and clark's world. I resisted reading this book because the plot sounded dreary, but I could not have been more mistaken.
0451232852|5.0|Enthralling!  I found this to be an excellent summary of the events around World War I.  Although I recalled the genesis of this horrible and unnecessary war, I forgot about the alliances that existed as well as how we we got drawn into the war.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It did not provide enough information about Wilson's flaws and dictatorial tendencies during wartime, but it did make mention of some.  In addition, it discussed the Russian Revolution as being an escape to something better as perceived by one of the main characters.  I suspect those poor souls thought that would be the case, and as history has revealed, it was going from the frying pan to the fire (read Ayn Rand's &#34;We The Living&#34;).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, but it is quite lengthy.  Think about reading it on a long plan ride heading for vacation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for this game on my kindle forever!!!! woohoooo its about time!!!! theres a lot of candy crush saga imitation game but nothing beats the real deal!!! thank u amazon!!!
B007SVPZMW|2.0|This game might be nice for very young kids but too slow and boring and easy for adults to enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had to think to figure out what I was missing. Great game!<br />Recommended for game lovers of all ages.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Not my idea of a good read at all. It was such a dismal story. A pull down. Better books out there more suited to me. If you are into this style, try it. I have it a shot and was right. I didn't care for it.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Peter Sellers was magnificent as were all the others.  But the lamentably late Mr. Sellers, as far as I'm concerned, owned the movie when it first came out and I still feel the way way.<br /><br />I've MET people with that &#34;war at any cost&#34; mentality; they scared the britches off of me.  I used to live not far from the former Carswell AFB and used to watch the '52s take off and land. I tried to block out the fact that they were carrying nuclear bombs to no avail.<br /><br />Being an Air Force vet and having had to visit SAC bases as part of my duties was just a tad frightening because I had the appropriate clearance to BE on the bases, but my Air Force issued cameras did not.  I never felt comfortable leaving my gear aboard the craft on which I flew into the bases, but didn't want to lug it around either. Classic SNAFU all the time.<br /><br />The closing shot of the movie was a bit too much like some of the characters I've run into. They would have loved to ride a Nuke down...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|lots of round and round and round and round and round and round and round. spend a little money and things move along faster. cute little minions.
B00AR3GPHW|5.0|He likes the vivid story and the pictures. I read this to my children before I have to leave for trips.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Boring.  Sofia Coppola needs to come up with some better ideas.  If you're in to couture fashion, check it out.  Otherwise, skip it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|:)<br />Could use some updates but otherwise a fun way to pass some time!<br />Its very creative and well done!
0765350386|5.0|Amazing book. you get your breath taken away. Brandon Sanderson is amazing. Take your time to read it and read the whole trilogy. He is amazing.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is a great, action packed movie filled with talented actors whose performance pays great tribute to the original cast! J.J. Abrams directs an outstanding movie which enhances the dream started by Gene Roddenberry! It is a must see, must own movie!!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very interesting, I like the historical references also.  Keeps you involved through the whole story. Top notch.<br />Try it. You won't regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this app is great, easy to get addicted to. only problem is every now and then it feezes. other then that its perfect
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|Not in a thousand years is this game worth $3.00. Maybe for a buck but even then it still gets boring after only a few minutes. I got it as the free app of the day and will be uninstalling.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY! My prayers have been answered: Candy Crush Saga is available on the Kindle Fire! This is a smoothly running app that packs loads of endless fun. Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|downloaded and it wouldn't load to play so I deleted it and tried again and still no play on my Kindle Fire HD. Would've loved to play it. Maybe I'll give it another try some day.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, a great King offering. Humor, sadness, all in one good book. Easy to read on Kindle as well.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|seems to do what it is suppose to. Haven't been on too much but so far I like it. Not hard to navigate on my Kindle Fire HD and easy to connect with others as usual.
B004R739LE|3.0|An acceptable choice.<br /><br />UPPER COMPARTMENT<br />I want to focus on the upper compartment first. It has 2 exterior pockets. The problem with these pockets is they are totally unpadded. The middle section in-between the pockets (the middle section with the Lowepro logo on it) is actually padded with a (very) thin layer of padding; it's just the pockets to the left and right of this that aren't! So the middle section between the pockets gets some padding but not the pockets themselves. This isn't ideal since whatever is inside these pockets can be damaged if hit hard enough. Sometimes the bag is on your back and you turn around and forget that you are carring a big load on your back and your bag hits into something when moving about. The unpadded nature of these pockets gives me a cheap feeling. Maybe that's unfair on Lowepro but I expected some padding here. Anyway, when you open these pockets they just consist of the one compartment: there are no mini-compartments inside these pockets to better organize smaller stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, moving on. Open up the main top secttion. Here your larger non-camera things such as lunch or clothing can fit. Inside we see a single mesh pocket. That's all. Again, no real options for compartmentalization if you want to store smaller stuff too. I would prefer if the mesh pocket wasn't mesh so whatever goes inside there can be better protected from any other things scratching it or getting caught on the mesh or doing damage. I'm unsure why mesh is often used, especially in simpler bags like this. Visibility of the contents shouldn't be the main priority. Protection should. So again the feeling of cheapness creeps in.<br /><br />LOWER COMPARTMENT<br />Unlike the upper compartment, the lower compartment is totally padded (good since most will want their camera gear in here). By default it is divided into 6 sections with dividers that are easily velcro-repositionable. The surfaces here consist of soft fleece and nylon. Which are soft fleece and which are nylon? The repositionable dividers have a nylon surface. It isn't as soft as the fleece surface. The inner top surface (the opening 'lid' of the bag) is also nylon. The parts that consist of the soft fleece are the bottom surface and sides of this compartment. I always prefer as much soft fleece as I can get. Anyway, the camera & other gear have adequate clearance from anything that could possibly scratch them. As the bottom section is opened & closed and the gear put in & pulled out, there is no real risk of scratching. Good to see. No metal bits. No nearby zips (zippers). Now closing up the lower compartment, we see a large buckle that can be used when we want to open & close the bag quickly without doing it the long way. Nice. 2 external lower mesh pockets sit on each side. These don't seem to be high enough for many water bottles. They really need more height. To me, it would be better if these mesh pockets were completely sealed pockets rather than mesh, perhaps with double zips (zippers) to also accommodate bottles too. There would be more opportunities to safely store other gear here and keep it away from typical rain and dust (as well as keep it protected with some padding). The mesh pockets limit the usefulness (and durability) of many bags, which again makes me think the bag design is a little cheap. Pretty much the only thing you can carry here is bottles when it could be so much more. Even when carrying bottles they are not adequately protected from shocks due to the cheap mesh (especially true of glass bottles), let alone the low height of the pockets.<br /><br />BOTTOM SURFACE<br />Looking at the 'feet' of the bag now. The bottom surface of the bag allows the attachment of a compact tripod or other gear (rolled-up clothing). The straps here are easily adjustable with the plastic buckles. Quite nice. The only problem is this: every time you put the bag down on the ground, the plastic buckles on the bottom surface are going toget in contact with the ground. They will get scratched and otherwise face the wear-and-tear every time you take the bag off your back to put it down somewhere. When doing so, the bag will not be completely flat, even when not using the bottom for anything, since the buckles have some height to them. There are no durable 'feet' for the bottom either, nor reinforced materials. All you notice here is a rather thin nylon like the rest of the bag, so it doesn't seem like the most durable bottom surface. The plastic buckles will be taking most of the scratches and wear-&-tear here and that's just simply bad design. There are no slits that the buckles and straps could slide into (to keep them out of harm's way). It's a disappointing omission that (again) makes me feel like this is a little cheap.<br /><br />OTHER<br />The main shoulder straps are adequately constructed. They are padded and otherwise comfortable. Eash strap has a small 'belt loop' on it which is designed to accommodate the attachment of smaller pouches with velcro-removable belt attachments. There is no chest harness. The part of the bag that touches your back is also adequately padded and comfortable. The carrying handle on the top of the bag seems adequate. Not the best and not the worst.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />* soft & cushy section for your camera gear with nicely adjustable internal dividers<br />* the top left & top right exterior pockets have zero padding. Not ideal.<br />* in my opinion, an over-use of cheap mesh pockets is evident here (but many other bags do the same)<br />* side mesh bottle pockets offer no protection and don't have enough height for many bottles. Poor design.<br />* in my opinion, elements of the design come across as cost savings rather than thoughtfulness<br />* bottom of the bag doesn't seem the most durable thing to put on the ground (and plastic buckles take the damage)<br />* no durable hard plastic or rubber feet for the bottom of the bag (for more longevity)<br /><br />Over-all, an adequate bag for the money. It will protect your camera gear but may disappoint those expecting a bit more for the money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun to play. it is truly an awesome game.if you don't have this game well you need to play.<br />try it!

B0053KWDES|5.0|When I first ordered this I was very sceptical of to how it would sound and OMG I was BLOWN AWAY!!! I have a pair of v-moda crossfade lp's and I paired this with them and I almost died when I felt the BASS!!! When I say bass I mean like 2 15 inch subwoofers literally on your head and I'm not over exagerating at all! If you love bass and want to impress your friends get this now!!!this makes beats alone look stupid.  I cannot stress enough how incredible this product is!!! If you listen to anyone's review listen to mine I swear you won't regret buying this. It's just out of this world mind blowing incredible!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My only complaint about this game is that there are only 10 rooms!!!  It was tough at times, but not impossible. So fun!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Works great for teaching kids. You can slow the speed down for tie as you go if need be. It is also excellent for adults just starting out or as a refresher.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|I had never heard of this movie before. I noticed the box cover and thought it looked really creepy. Then I found out it was a vampire movie. I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies or anything closely related to them. Something about it seemed a little intriguing so I took a chance on it. OMG! Where has this movie been all my life!? This is definitely not aimed at the Twilight viewer. This was one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. I hesitate to even qualify it as a vampire movie. Yes she is a vampire, but there are so many layers to this movie. It is scary at times, and very moving at others. Kodi Smit-McPhee is so good in his role, you really just want to hug him and tell him everything will be okay. Chloe Moretz also does an excellent job in her role (she is starring as Carrie in the remake). Did anyone notice that they never show the moms face in the movie? It was kinda strange and intriguing. And I don't want to spoil anything but pretty much everything you want to happen in the movie does. So that is quite different to have a happy ending in a scary movie. My husband was so excited that I found this unexpected gem of a movie. We are definitely putting it in our Halloween movie rotation. I don't know why this movie didn't get more publicity. Maybe it did and I somehow missed it, but I am so happy that I found it and I would recommend this to anyone! Vampire fan or not, you will love the story. Parental warning-there is one scene where a ladies nipple shows for about 2 seconds. Other than that no sex or nudity.
B008JFUOVI|4.0|I liken the first Hangover to the comedy genre what the Matrix was to sci fi. It was very original and the best thing to come along in a long time. There was no way any sequel was ever going to live up to the first movie, and that was made apparent when the best they could do for the second movie was to just copy the first one, just swapping out some of the jokes.<br /><br />This, honestly would have been a far better follow up to the first movie. It expands on what happened in the first movie, even bringing back some of the same characters (even the baby as a 4yr old kid). The best thing about it, is that while it does refer back to the other movies, it was not a carbon copy of them. There is still a lot of crude humor and over the top situations in this one, so if you do not like that kind of stuff in a movie, or did not like the others then you will not like this. I think if you really liked the first movie, you can enjoy this one (even if you did not like the second one) if you are willing to accept the fact that it is not as good as the original.<br /><br />As for extras, there are a handful of relatively short behind the scenes features, a gag reel, and some deleted scenes. Nothing too extensive, but amusing for those who like to go through that stuff.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Maybe I read too many wonderful reviews of this book before I read it because I was expecting a lot more from it. I didn't believe the main female character (I can't even remember her name) as she waivered between self-doubt and take-charge attitudes. I'm not sure the author knew how to end the book. While I certainly didn't expect a happy ending, I certainly didn't expect the ending to be glossed over.
B009LDD4Z0|5.0|Chances are by now you know how you feel about Bones. If you have liked the show up to this point you will likely still enjoy this season. If you don't like it, this season will not do anything to change your mind because it really follows the same formula as it has the past few years.<br /><br />I think the stories are still compelling and interesting enough to keep the show fun to watch. It does a good job of blending the case of the week stories with the ongoing story arcs. The main antagonist this season continues to be Pelant. The storyline from the last season which resulted in the end of the season cliffhanger is resolved quickly in Season 8. Pelant however keeps coming back throughout the season to make the lives of the team hell.<br /><br />The show has kept the rotating interns that stemmed from the one story line from the show whose outcome I did not like, and that was having Zach written off the show. The show does a good job of actually giving them more to do that just being Brennan's sidekicks and it seems like the show is going to stick with that format for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Aside from the stretches that the show makes with reality which you either accept or not, the only thing that was completely unrealistic from this season was about Hodgins money. You have to suspend your disbelief for what happens initially, but I personally think the directon the show takes the aftermath is just dumb.<br /><br />The rest of the season really revolves around Booth and Brennan as a couple, and as parents. I think that part of the story is well written and has done a good job of not making the relationship stale which is always the danger in bringing lead characters into a relationship.<br /><br />For those who get the blu ray set, there are deleted scenes and commentary on some episodes, an &#34;Ask Bones&#34; feature where cast members answer questions submitted by fans, a short ultimate fan segment and a gag reel. Not a ton of extras but enough there if you do like going through that material. Also, the blu rays allow you to play it in season mode, so you can stop at any point and pick back up where you left off.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This novel is beautifully written, interesting and insightful. Focusing on the lives of two families with very different backgrounds, the author leads the reader on a journey about love and loyalty during the terrible events of the second world war in Europe.<br /><br />Greta, a Jewish girl, falls in love with the handsome young German who works in her local bookstore. She falls pregnant and they marry with the conflict of war bringing complications to their relationship and the future of their children. Wilhelm takes their son to Germany and divorces her as Greta gives birth to their second son.<br /><br />The novel is filled with tension as the reader is introduced to an array of characters, each of whose life is affected by the haunting events playing out around them.<br /><br />The description in this book is amazing in its detail and the author has clearly researched the period and events thoroughly. I really felt I was increasing my knowledge about the war, without going over old ground, as well as reading an enjoyable tale.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the second book in this wonderful trilogy.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I got this FAOTD thinking &#34;Well, this might be a little fun&#34;, but I got to where I couldn't put it down. I found myself picking up my Fire to just play &#34;for a couple of minutes&#34;, but before I knew it 20 minutes had gone by.  Kind of hooks me like &#34;Cubistry&#34;.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Nothing exciting happened.  Cheesy scenes all over the place.  Total lackluster...complete disappointment.  The idea of the story seems really neat, it just failed horribly at the execution part. When will Hollywood learn to stay away from m night shyamalan at all costs!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Typical Stephen King. While I'm not a fan of the macabre, I find that he doesn't get too graphic for me. The man sure knows how to turn a phrase ! I love his stuff !
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I got started and I didn't want to put it down. The characters were believable and I felt like I could identify with them. I enjoyed the story and I want to see what happens next. This book was recommended to me and I would recommend it as well.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great way to clear space up on Kindle. This app works automatically and when it detects space needs to be cleaned up it shows up in your notifications.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very interesting series (currently on series 2) and find the episodes provoke so much thought about &#34;What if......?&#34;  Excellently written and supreme acting.  Very, very worth my time.  Oh, by the way, this weekend is a marathon streaming &#34;Fringe&#34; Weekend!  All hail the brains behind this program!

0440245915|5.0|IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND AS STATED AND MAKES A FINE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION I CANT WAIT FOR THE REST THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Another great read from Mr. King.  It brings back some old monsters from The Shining, and adds some whole new ones in the True Knot. The modern day gypsy vampire concept is an intriguing concept.  Hopefully they will make a reappearance sometime in the future....it only takes one to have quietly escaped!  As always, I love how Mr. King always integrates the endearing and deep friendship stories into his tale's.  I highly recommend this book to any King fan!
B009715NUK|4.0|It's a bit downbeat in it's lyrics, but like the rest of Elysium, it's a beautiful piece of music, played and sung just perfectly. If you can find the remixes, they are great too, and really give the song a lift.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this app. it is kind of like a hidden object game in that you have to find the items needed to advance to the next level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing candy crush on my phone and Facebook for a while.I 'm so happy that it is on the Kindle now.  I enjoy the game even though it gets a little frustrating at times
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|This game was good until i get back on it one day and all my data was gone. Can someone explain to me why this happened
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Franchise is over. Boring.  Clever seems redundant.  Same person/charachter that never evolves shows no effort and treats the audience like it doesn't deserve quality.  That is an artist riding his own coat tails. Don't waste your time. ..
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought this to use it with Mass Effect 3 and Diablo 3. Kind of silly since you don't play a game... forever and the trend for games now is to use LESS and LESS buttons.<br /><br />Eventually we'll all be playing on XBOX controllers anyway, save yourself the money and buy an XBOX controller for PC instead. Unless you religiously play RTS only, this is not really useful to you.<br /><br />But when you do use it, it works perfectly.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|It is always hard to listen to a new album by a well established artist. I got the basic  version of  \\"NEW\\".  There are a couple of deluxe versions ex : Best Buy. Anyways,  Paul is definitely a happy man these days from the tone of the album. It really has a fresh updated sound. I will not go into real specifics since I barely listened once. But these tracks stick out- 1.Save Us (produced by Paul Epworth),  3. On My Way To Work (produced by Giles Martin)<br />4. Queenie Eye (produced by Paul Epworth) I think the next single,  5. Early Days (produced by Ethan Johns) which is a lovely classic McCartney acoustic ballad, 6. New (produced by Mark Ronson) the single. I predict it will be in the BILLBOARD Top Ten this coming week. I've been following Paul McCartneys' solo output since the mid 1970's. This is one of the better McCartney albums in a while. Check it out. Hopefully the Band on the Run will come our ways.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|So good to know what happened to Danny, after all this time. And if you read between the lines....you see Stephen King's heart and soul laid bare. Thank you for everything you shared with us here Mr King.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much and it is so much fun.  Also all of me and all my friends can play.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I had missed this one - great story telling!  Will look forward to the next part of the Trilogy.  Period pieces are always in style.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE THIS WHOLE SERIES. This series kept me interested the whole time. I appreciate books that draws me into the book. Wonderful Job E.L.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Seriously though. Super helpful as well as engaging.. The whole family is already using strategies from it. We're taking second looks at habits that might be good and trying to create habits for the things we want to accomplish.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its a fun and challenging game. I play it whenever I have a chance... luv luv luv luv it!!! You should really download it ;)
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Set in a graphic world of drugs, sex, money, and violence, Get Clean is a compelling novel, which is different from your average cookie-cutter thriller; I mean that in a highly positive sense. The book has a 'Breaking Bad' vibe, as another reviewer pointed out. It's a dark read, the type of story I find fascinating. I don't want to give the plot away, but again, if you liked 'Breaking Bad', and many people did, you'll likely enjoy this book. Give it a read.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good story about the little boy from the Shining.  And Stephen King too.  Very nostalgic as always.<br />A heros tale of facing demons of the past and redemption.  All while coming to terms with his special gift/curse.<br />I really enjoyed the book, especially having just read the Shining, and still having Danny's world still fresh in my head.<br />I know one thing I will not look at group of folks I see all over the place the same way again.<br />I'll always snicker and wonder.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I believe that art can infuse anything we do, for everything has an art to it’s nature. Creation is at the center of art, so create anything and there is art. More people are becoming aware of how food and art intersect. More people in the west are becoming aware of the art of sushi. If there is one form of art that can compare in nature to that of sushi’s, it would be the composition of the haiku. So, as I watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi I could not help but see each of these small creations of sushi as a poetic endeavor, a haiku rendered in fish and rice.<br /><br />  Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a documentary about the master sushi chef Ono Jiro and his restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro. This little restaurant, which is located in a subway terminal of all places, has won a consecutive three star rating from Michelin. Something very few restaurants can do. Jiro has two sons who he taught his craft to. The youngest, Takashi, went and opened his own restaurant. His oldest, Yoshikazu, has stayed and keeps working under him. So, the documentary really focuses on this working father - son relationship, and the love of the art of sushi.<br /><br /> Jiro hides nothing, he has no secret technique he guards jealously. He believes only in taking the time to prepare the fish with as much skill and care as possible. It is Yoshikazu who selects the fish from the market. He will only take the best, at the same time only dealing with the best in the business. However, it is more than just care taken with a raw material. They work to perfect the way a particular fish is sliced, or how the rice is prepared. They use a particular rice as well. The rice dealer refuses to sell this rice to anyone else, because only Jiro knows how to prepare it, in his opinion.<br /><br /> While the art of sushi is front and center, the underlaying theme is the relationship between father and son. Yoshikazu is the reason Sukiyabashi Jiro has the three star rating, as the documentary makes clear near the end. It stands to reason that he is more skilled then his father, but will never be recognized for it as his father’s shadow will always fall over him. The differences in the two brothers is clear. The younger Takashi, who owns his own place seems less stressed than Yoshikazu, who is waiting to inherit. That doesn’t mean that Yoshikazu does not have the same love for his craft as his father does. In fact, he many love it more.<br /><br /> The film also touches upon the fishing industry. Jiro remarks that the size and quality of the fish has decreased over the years, making it harder to produce good sushi. Yoshikazu doesn’t hold back and says out right that there must be strong regulations on fishing, especially tuna. He says that business is dependent on the natural resources of the planet and to practice unsustainable fishing is to put themselves out of business while destroying the environment. The film shows the staggering differences between catches made fifty years ago and the ones being made today.<br /><br /> The filmmakers were not unaware of the poetic nature of their subject and the film is beautifully shot because of this. The slow motion preparation of eels and tuna, with water splashing over working hands becomes visual poems of life lived and loved for art. These memorizing scenes are backed by either great classical pieces but more often by Phillip Glass’s haunting music, which furthers the hypnotic power of watching these masters at work. When Jiro or Yoshikazu is filmed finishing a piece of sushi for a guest, they place it on these black square plates. For a moment the camera lingers on the dish and it seems as if the dish is a painting, or a sculpture making an observation concerning quality over quantity.<br /><br /> Being a lover of the sushi I was very interested in watching this film. However, I can recommend it for anyone, even those who hate sushi. Jiro and his son are quite enjoyable people, and if their personalities aren’t enough, theirphilosophy should be. Jiro advises people to love their job, and never stops trying to find the next level of his own perfection. He is something like an eighty-five year old Bruce Lee, in his attitude at least. Yoshikazu, despite his love of speed, speaks of patience, patience with learning skills, patience with nature, and patience with business. He is the embodiment of the motto, good things are worth waiting and working for. Whether you wish to learn about Jiro and Yoshikazu, or about sushi, or about life, I suggest you watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi.philosophy should be.

B00E6F1522|5.0|I've been a Ferry fan for decades (it would be indiscreet to say how many) and it's exciting to see him bring an entire lifetime of experience and performance to the catalogue; this gorgeous concert ranges from the first Roxy release to the very latest work. I'm also pleased with how much Bryan plays piano on this release- Colin Good is a virtuoso, and I like his function as music director, but no one plays Ferry like Ferry himself.<br /><br />Bryan in his 60s is my favorite Bryan Ferry ever- and I can't wait to see what he does next.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a tale of love, loss, redemption and hope. Molly and Vivian were an unlikely duo who forged a friendship that know no bounds. My heart went out to the two of them as the tale unfolded. I wish there was more to the story--but there could always be a sequel!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Fun show to watch with the guys. Just action pretty much, don't expect a soap opera or drama. Liked it. 3.5/5.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great item works just as described.  FYI the iPod Touch 5 does not fit correctly in it.  It doesn't seal as tight as it does with the iPhone.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Just finished watching Now You See Me. It was very entertaining. Very little character development with the majority of the characters, but that's due to the fast pace. The focus is on the overall plot, not the individual characters. With the exception of Morgan Freeman, they could have replaced any of the actors with other actors and the movie would have still been just the same. And with most movies, you can guess what's going to happen half way before you get there, but not so with this movie. I feel like the plot is a victim of its own success, though. It's as if the writers wrote and twisted themselves into a very small box with no way out. The ending suffers because of this. You're left saying \\"What?\\" and scratching your head. It's as if the writers closed their eyes, randomly chose a way to end the movie, and then did a horrible job of coordinating the ending with the rest of the plot. Enjoyed the beginning and middle, hated the ending. Regardless, though, you will be surprised!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Now if you don't like boxing than you will still like this as I'm not a sports fan. The storyline is fabulous and the acting is magnificent making you feel that you are there, right in the middle of it all, Sylvester and cast do a fantastic job and the show will always be around for years to come. Wanting something different well this is it. Plenty of things happening that you have to watch it all the time not missing out on anything. Story is about a boxer that has other issues with family and friends, now that is all as not to spoil a great movie. I rated this an A grade plus for the fantastic action and twist and turns that keeps the entertainment going, so what are  you waiting for, go collect your popcorn put your feet up and relax for a surprising night of great classics.  Enjoy!

B0055D3EFU|3.0|First, I'm so glad I waited until I could stream this via a rental rather than a permanent purchase.  \\"Insidious\\" is definitely scary/creepy/unsettling from the very first shots; despite this, something was bugging me about the movie.  About 45 minutes in I realized what it was: there is no story.  The creepiness has nothing to do with the narrative, but rather the camera work and scoring -- this is quite common these days.  However this particular movie is presented as if there is going to be a meaningful narrative.  A musician mother and teacher father and their three young children move into a house paneled with lots of dark oak .  It is said that \\"things are going to be better\\" now that they've moved, hinting at previous problems. These problems are perhaps connected to the mother's unhappiness; she is very grateful that her husband is allowing her to focus on her music full-time now.  Still, it's apparent that she doesn't feel he's really helpful enough.  Has there been marital strife?<br /><br />After a few nights in the house, the oldest son is in a coma that confounds medical experts and the house is full of unexplained disturbances.  After about three months, the mother is insistant upon moving.  Her chronically detached husband agrees so they do, and find themselves still \\"haunted\\" by whatever it was that was tormenting them in the first house.  It isn't until the family moves into this second home that there is any glimpse of a tangible story.  Unfortunately for \\"Insidious,\\" that story is \\"Poltergeist\\" -- without the depth.<br /><br />The only element that is introduced in the beginning of \\"Insidious\\" that is carried through is the fact that the father doesn't like to have his picture taken.  What previous problems did the family have?  Who knows.  Instead, the paternal grandmother is introduced and we enter what seems like a whole different movie.  All that was frightening about it to begin with is lost as it unravels into ridiculousness.  And it can't be said enough how derivative the story is of \\"Poltergeist.\\"  \\"Poltergeist\\" isn't necessarily scary, but it has that thing about it that elevates a mediocre horror movie to the realm of the iconic: a point.  At its center, \\"Poltergeist\\" is about the hippie generation grappling with the \\"greed is good\\" mentality of the 1980's -- a commentary on capitalism, traditional values, etc.  There is no such subtext in \\"Insidious.\\"<br /><br />To give an example of how little \\"Insidious\\" focuses on a script or story continuity, the grandmother is supposed to be watching the other 2 kids while a supernatural rescue team tries to save the boy in a coma (i.e., bring his soul back to his physical being).  There is no mention of her having a husband, of there being a grandfather.  In fact, despite the family's earlier problems, despite this woman's grandson needing round the clock medical care, we don't see this character the entire first half of the movie.  Yet when they call her to the house she runs right over in a matter of minutes so she's clearly nearby -- unless the father got a new teaching gig and they up and moved across the country.  And now that the grandmother is participating in the festivities, the other kids are with whom?  But she needs to be there because any substantive story the movie has is based on the grandmother's dialogue; about 80 minutes in, she (with the aid of the leader of the supernatural rescue team) explains to the audience what the reason for all the ghosts, demons, and creepiness is. That's how exciting it is -- straight-up exposition.<br /><br />At this point, the movie is not scary.  It is silly.  Rose Byrne (mother), Patrick Wilson (father), Barbara Hershey (grandmother), et al can't be faulted for empty performances since they had so little with which to work.  Suddenly, the sick boy's freaky drawings which have been on his wall for months and are freaky regardless of what has subsequently been revealed have meaning!  We never find out why the family moved into the first new house to begin with.  If there were problems in their previous home, it can only be assumed, but then why would the mother feel moving a third time would make it any better?  And although the ending is supposed to represent a twist, I figured it out, as I think many people would given that these movies always end with a twist and there aren't many directions in which to go here.<br /><br />So, \\"Insidious\\" is scary in the beginning, but in the same way walking through a haunted house is scary because you are literally following the camera turning the set into a haunted house. A dark realm is explored toward the end, but by that point I personally couldn't stop comparing the ways in which the movie was like -- and not as good as -- \\"Poltergeist.\\"  The movie stops being engaging just at the point it's really supposed to get intense.  Bottom line: it really needed more of an original story, and that story really needed to be integral to more of the movie, not just the second half of it.

1455502758|5.0|It's Christopher Hitchens, no review is needed. His ability to express through literature was unmatched. To say the least, superb!!! The world suffered a great loss with the death of Christoper Hitchens. He was a geniius. His writings superseded most. For me, it was tragic. As for the courage it took to write this book; once again he proved himself to be a man amongst men. Phenomenal!!! That was the \\"Hitch\\"!!!!!! Love, forever love!!! Amazing!!!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the heroine.  She was a young woman who was so full of creativity, love and promise; but who was unable to believe in herself and her own value as a person because of past experience.  The other characters are also believable and well developed.  Sometimes life turns around and blesses you.

B005LAIIMG|4.0|Could have followed the book a little more closely without being a problem but overall an excellent value for an evenings viewing pleasure
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I was excited to read this book, and was very disappointed once I did. He makes sweeping generalizations that are at odds with accepted theories. That is not a bad thing, unless it is plain wrong. Aslan dismisses any anti-violence teachings by Jesus, seeing no way that such thinking would be anything but capitulation. The book offers great background history, but relegates Jesus to the realm of just another zealot.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very good read!  I did a bit of air travel recently with several legs and layovers.  Finished the book after a day of flying and waiting in airports and was really surprised to find that I did not feel put out about the arrangements at all.<br /><br />This is an historical novel that begins in the early 18th century.  It has a story line (well, really several story lines) and an educational component.  It reveals the disparity in income between the aristocracy of several European countries and the poor classes and the subsequent development of several varieties of socialism.<br /><br />I feel entertained and educated for having read it.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Takes a little while to figure out how to use it.<br />Google is advertising that this ChromeCast is ready to work straight out of the box and it says you can do so much with it which is not true. The ChromeCast has a lot of limitations.<br /><br />I cannot connect by Ethernet to my Wireless Router and then to the Google ChromeCast. Your computer needs to have a WIFI card as well. That is stupid even though the ChromeCast is setup on my Wireless Router.<br />I also had to disabled my Comodo Firewall to use the Google Chrome addon within the Chrome browser. Windows default Firewall does not need to be disabled.<br />The Google Cast extension for Windows does not function at all on Win8 without a Wireless WIFI card. Keeps telling me to connect to WIFI and I'm already connected by Ethernet.<br />I cannot stream any video from my Win8 computer to ChromeCast.<br /><br />Be-warned, ChromeCast is still in Beta testing but Google is selling it as a final release product which is wrong and should be illegal to do. I want a final product not a beta product because beta is known to have problems. But the ChromeCast is able to receive updates.<br /><br />At first I wasn't able to stream Netflix from Chrome browser to ChromeCast. This is now fixed.<br />ChromeCast as of right now only works with Google Chrome browser and not other web browsers. I expect this to change later.<br />I can stream YouTube fine from Chrome browser to ChromeCast. The streaming quality is very well. It's a little weird on how you stream it to the ChromeCast which is not user friendly.<br />I can also stream video from other websites too and it streams very well.<br />I can stream online video from my Android phone and tablet very well.<br /><br />I am sure that Google will fix some of the issues that I am having later as they release more updates.<br /><br />The ChromeCast itself is small in design and I like that. You plug it into the back of your TV by HDMI and then plug in the power adapter that came with it. I had to use an extension power cable because the power adapter than came with ChromeCast was to short.with it.

B008EKMB82|3.0|This book took forever to finish, because I really vacillated about giving it up. But, she's like a Canadian great, as is my beloved Margaret Atwood, and this novel was on the short list for the Booker Prize. I skimmed a lot in this book, I followed the story lines that most interested me. However, the overall effect of the story that entwines history, cultural validity and personal quests for innate superpowers, was very \\"felt.\\" What I mean, is after reading it I decided to be unpredictable in my behavior, to see what would happen to my most intimate relationships. It got me thinking and taking action within myself, which all the best books do. I am not a Zen Buddhism fan, a nun in this book says \\"up is down, down is up, same thing,\\" and that is irritating. They are not the same. Oh well, I guess it really doesn't matter. WHAT????
B005XN31LY|5.0|So far I have only watched the Pilot and episodes 2 & 3, but I am hooked!  It is the most imaginative, unusual TV series I have ever seen.  Maybe because I am a retired Senior, and read a great deal as a child and throughout the rest of my life, I am very familiar with all the Fairy Tales and loved the &#34;and they lived happily every after&#34; endings.<br /><br />This series takes away those endings and brings you into the present day, but with your favorite Fairy Tale characters as residents in a small town.  It's fun to guess who is who as the storyline goes back and forth to the Fairy Tale time to now.<br /><br />It's an incredible journey.  You can &#34;stream&#34; the pilot for a very small cost just to see what and how all this is accomplished.<br /><br />Sheer genius as far as writing, production and even special effects.  Kudos!!!

B00DSTBMMU|3.0|Well it's not a great stretch for Sheryl Crow to go country. For me, Ms. Crow has not been able to match the brilliance of her 1993 debut &#34;Tuesday Night Music Club&#34;. She's always been a second prize winner--good music, uneven album after album. Still, she's had a good run after 20 years, but now she's asking fans to travel to different musical ground with her. &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; is Crow's first foray into country, which, as it turns out, isn't true country. I mean, I don't like country music, generally speaking, but if I'm going to listen to country music I'm going to listen to classic country, not this modern country rock knock-off garbage that, for me, started with Garth Brooks in the early 1990's and has only continued to evolve into this hideous monster called modern country.<br /><br />And that's where Sheryl Crow comes in with &#34;Feels Like Home&#34;, working with Brad Paisley, a modern country star. So, if you're hoping Ms. Crow gets down to 'real' country, well she doesn't. She apes modern country, and she does it fairly easily, but then that's not saying much as modern country is garbage as I've already established. A momentary digression....Ms. Crow's last album was &#34;100 Miles From Memphis&#34; which, to her credit, only had three cover songs and nine originals meant to hearken back to that old Memphis soul sound of the 60's/70's. She did that fairly well. But this is what I'm saying: This is two albums now of non-Sheryl Crow music. Does she really expect us, as fans, to believe she's gone all country now and isn't coming back? Jewel has tried this with very limited success.<br /><br />So, if I have to look forward to Ms. Crow doing country from now on then she's has some work to do. &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; is average at best. Sure, there's catchy tunes, but what Crow album doesn't have catchy tunes? Sure, there's humor here and there, but Crow has that on many of her albums as well. What's missing here is the songwriting. These songs, to me, are dumbed down for that 'modern country' audience she seems to be pandering to. Well, I'm here to say that the lyrics don't need to be dumbed down. The one song I felt demonstrated this best was the closing track, &#34;Stay At Home Mother&#34;. It's this song that I felt captures the essence of Crow with it's gentle melody, relaxed vocals, and heartfelt mood. This one track felt honest and sincere. The rest, well, I suppose there are truthful elements to &#34;Waterproof Mascara&#34; that parallel Crow's personal life. I mention honesty, because, to me, good country is made by honest country singer/songwriters who sing about what they know (not today's slick, dumb country stars).<br /><br />&#34;Easy&#34;, &#34;Callin' Me When I'm Lonely&#34;, &#34;Crazy Ain't Original&#34;, &#34;Homesick&#34; and &#34;Best Of Times&#34; round out the good tracks here. The rest can fade to black. So, as a long time fan, I wasn't looking forward to &#34;Feels Like Home&#34;. Crow made it barely tolerable. I need to go listen to Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson to rinse of this modern country grime now.<br /><br />Note to Crow: I really enjoyed your 2008 album &#34;Detours&#34;. Why can't you continue to be more experimental like that? You are at your best when using modern technology to push the boundaries of your sound as exemplified by &#34;Tuesday Night Music Club&#34;, &#34;Sheryl Crow&#34;, &#34;The Globe Sessions&#34;, &#34;C'mon C'mon&#34; and &#34;Detours&#34;--all your best works. I know you live in Tennessee now, but can't you buck the system and NOT do country just because you actually live in the country now?<br /><br />Here's how &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; compares with Crow's other works:<br /><br />1993 Tuesday Night Music Club: Five Stars<br />1996 Sheryl Crow: Four Stars<br />1998 The Globe Sessions: Four Stars<br />2002 C'mon C'mon: Four Stars<br />2005 Wildflower: Two and a Half Stars<br />2008 Detours: Four Stars<br />2010 100 Miles From Memphis: Three Stars<br />2013 Feels Like Home: Three Starsetours: Four Stars<br />2010 100 Miles From Memphis: Three Stars<br />2013 Feels Like Home: Three Stars
B004GHNH7Q|5.0|This was my sons Hawaii trip reading assignment for school. Was quick read for my son...who really loves to read.
B009LOJK1Q|2.0|Big disappointment. King was a hero to me at high school. Perhaps that's the problem. But in my mind Kings novels are terrifying and brilliantly written. This was tedious. Almost nothing happens. I had to really wade through it to finish. And the climax was a real fizzer. Does he dumb down, I wonder, to sell to as many people as possible. If you think about it, his books are in every bookshop in the English speaking world. Many many dull people buy books. Perhaps he is being deliberate, for cash. It's a pity if he is.

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I saw this show seven (7) times live and has been waiting for this release with great anticipation. But the quality of the sound and picture on this disc is probably the worst I've seen since Kylie released her X-Tour a few years back. The editing is so fast (often several times in a second!) you can hardly see any expressions on Madonna's face, which is also so white and pale caused by an \\"instagram-filter\\" color grading, which in my opinion ruins the whole thing. The film is grey and grainy compared to the colorful and sharp show I saw live on stage. The sound of the cheering audience is also put on top of the audio, which is so annoying I don't know what to say. This is obviously not from the live recording of the show, cause I cannot remember the crowd shouting, screaming and applauding non-stop for 2 hours, which this release want you to believe - and at the same time totally ruin the sound of the film. It is no secret that the footage is taken from several different shows, but it is a bit annoying to watch her clothes and hair alter from one picture to the other during the same song. Very very dissapointed about this realease. I was so looking forward to show this to my friends who didn't go to the show, but this release don't do the MDNA show justice. Unfortunately.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Unsurprisingly given that this is merely the companion to book 4 rather than the successor - this book continues to build tension as we approach the battle for Meereen across the Narrow Sea and the battle for mankind in the North with the battle for Winterfell in the mix as well!  Given the complexity of the gritty world that Martin has created the engaged reader will look for foreshadowing of what is to come.  Does Melisandre give Jon the breath of life?  Does Brown Ben Plumm take Tyrion to Daenerys so that she learns more of her dragons?  Does Daenerys return to Meereen on Drogon leading a Dothraki horde?<br /><br />Mr. Martin has created a vast area of possibilities that will make the reader frustrated and annoyed that he/she cannot dive into Book Six and see where these threads come together.  The journey has been a long one for those use to instant gratification and those who come later will never appreciate the power the author has invoked over his readership but this series must rank as one of the truly epic fantasies ever written.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|If you're looking for a feel good movie - then this one is it. Great for kids to watch (or you know for us who are dreading going out in the rain and just want to curl up with some home made popcorn and a movie. )
B001O3Y78I|5.0|Recommend for anyone who likes Depeche mode songs, a MUST for Depeche mode fans.  Some songs aren't that great, some are good, others are AWESOME.  You be the judge, but you won't be disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very interesting game. It not only challenged the mind but also made you use your creativity and kept you interested the whole time. The puzzles are varied, the graphics are stunning, and the story draws you in (there's a pun there if you've played the game). I can't wait for the sequel to come out. Well done Firehouse.
034553154X|5.0|I enjoy this calendar as most GOT fans see it and have no idea what they're looking at.  It takes them a few minutes to figure out its from the books and hasn't taken place in the show yet.  FUN conversations!
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Nice cartoon graphics and ok gameplay. Nothing incredibly difficult and doesn't keep your attention for too long. Might be good for kids.
B00165KRQU|5.0|for any Duran Duran or basic 80s music fan this is a must have.  It's missing a few great ones, but has most for then....most? part.
B000OSC3GM|5.0|Intergering plan excellent direction very well acted  nice and simple only drama not hi if action just the plain and simple story
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Okay. Not Gone with the wind. Not an intellectual thought provoking film. Not a film that will foster self awareness. Just an old fashioned scrappin' Friday afternoon at the local professional wresting arena kind of movie. Not a lot of character development and fairly simple story line. Bad mutant dinosaur slash invading Godzilla type creatures invading Earth and the good guys have to take them out before they take all of us out. What could be more fun than that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive but a great game all in all. Love this game and play it every chance I get...every day after working.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book in the series did not disappoint me.  Part way through it I was worried I might not like the ending but I found the ending to be very satisfying.  Another great read.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I'm a big will smith fan, This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. It took 40mim for any action, If you need to go to sleep rent it!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read the Hunger Games, you will want to go right to the next book in the series.  Outstanding reading.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Good movie.  Much better than it Appeared to be.  Effects and story really do a lot to carry it.  Will surprise you
B00C7IMJQG|4.0|This entire series was an absolute page turner. The twist at the end came out of nowhere!! Brilliant read with a thrill on every page.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Very funny and sometimes sad Wall Street tale. Exposition on financial dealings weaved perfectly into the narrative. This is a long book at 500 pages, but I didn't want it to end.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I watched this with my granddaughter and what a wonderful time. Hollywood needs to make more movies like this. Wonderful sets for a magnificent story. Great
0451419243|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book of this trilogy, you will absolutely love this book. I thought it was going to take me a month to read but it was hard to put down. I finished in a couple of weeks and can hardly wait to read the final book of the Century Trilogy.
B002DXN2PW|5.0|Sounds great nothing like the original lp that I played thousands of times. Wish they would have found the lost mix sooner.  God rest your souls Johnny and Jerry.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I tend to enjoy most everything I read, but I was obsessed.  Can not wait for book 6, and the continuation of this saga.  If you like history and fantasy, s science fiction, and everything in between this is the story for you.  I laughed, cried, and was surprised in turns.  Awesome read!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Like the,title the,sound,is awesome I get to Iisten to my favorite music from the rock area. Only thing I would like to select the ARTIST myself.
B007EC27QM|1.0|Don't waste your time. This is a basic calculator, no more. The calculator that comes with your phone or tablet is better.
0399159347|4.0|Interesting reading, I loved the characters and could not put the book down. I wish the ending was more detailed.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Thank you for an enlightening book of instructions for future Kindle Books. Helpful hints and easy to read. I'll be sure to take note!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this dictionary because it helps me with my words and it helps my grammar and it helps me understand words.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|happy to use it when needed but still use the desk top when possible, my wife uses this app more than I do because of the convenience I am sure.<br /><br />hope this helps<br />Samsung 2
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this book because it helps me understand words I need to know about.and it helps me with my grammar
B006LRUVUA|5.0|enough said right<br /><br />I think there might be a 5 minute timeout but I can't remember for sure.<br />still very happy and I can usually get in and get out by then with no problems in not sign right back in.<br /><br />If you set up and account you can set up your computers and give a password so if you get kicked you can sign in without having to get another numeric code from the computer you are trying to access (all this for free I add)<br /><br />thanks teamviewer and thanks dad for turning me on to it. He uses this to fix my computer from southern California while I am in Northern California, Please not no rules are broken<br /><br />use with confidence
B009IF8CH6|5.0|, Scripts are au courant, acfing is brilliant the acting never overdone, just right  Each episode is fresh and unforseen with many things hidden as in the Halloween costume choices of &#34;Blossom and Joey&#34; for Sheldon and Amy!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Great value! Easily ordered and packing was strong and easy to open! Recommend this for everyone's use! A must buy!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|An interesting, well written and amazing true story by the author.  The book is based on the subject of one woman's survival in the wilderness on the Pacific Crest Trail and the survival in life.  She managed to conquer both....or did she?
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|This series is fantastic, even if the teenage angst borders on the too much from time to time. This season, like last season, fall into old patterns. I think the new set of doppelgangers is an old hat. I was looking forward to the plot moving on as Elana  went to college but it just got sucked right back into the doppelganger rerun. I hope that the new episodes bring out a refreshed story line. It is STILL WORTH WATCHING.
B00C58QP72|4.0|Kept me interested.  Realistic mountain climbing scenes.  Enjoyed the story line and what the climbers went through and overcame.  I'd watch it again.
B005721W9O|4.0|great mix of spoof and reality<br />the mindlessness of obsession and false identity as it gives way to real hearts when the fantasy turns real and the players step up
B00ECLU346|2.0|Disappointing, big fan of series, they blew it on number 3. Just did not seem very funny. But second is my fav
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Chalk up another good album to the PJ catalogue! This album is along the lines of their self titled album and Backspacer.  There are some potential radio hits in \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Sleeping by myself tonight.\\"  It's full of really solid songs as well.  The first song, \\"Getaway\\" is a great way to start of the album and \\"infallible,\\" \\"let the records play,\\" and \\"yellow moon\\" are other examples of good songs.  This album is not in the same class as epic albums as Ten and Vs, but as I said it's really good.  If you are a fan of Pearl Jam then you will enjoy this album.<br /><br />There are really only 2 songs that I would consider just average or slightly below.  Those are \\"Pendelum\\" and \\"My Father's Son\\".  Everything else here is good.  The 4 stars I'm rating this is only because Ten and Vs are worthy of 5 stars.  Since Lightning Bolt has only been out under a week it's tough to say if I would move this up in the rankings closely behind \\"Vitalogy\\" and possibly \\"Yield\\", but it's a really good album and over time I only see it going up in my ranking of the pearl jam catalogue
B005FUTC86|5.0|Loving having this in my collection. I can understand that all versions should have a widescreen option for this because it is such a colorful movie, and mine does, so just read descriptions carefully. Grateful that so many of my childhood favorites are still available.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Although I enjoyed the first book, Follett has done an even better job with this second book of the trilogy.<br />His attention to detail of every major event in this book as well as his further development of the many characters that we came to know in the first book were excellently done!  I cannot wait to read Book Three!  Follett is simply the best.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|This is now one of my favorite Alter Bridge albums.  It is very rare when you get really good lead singing coupled with really great guitar and drums (like Led Zeppelin) with some longevity under their belt. But what sets this album above the pervious ones is that the band keeps improving and Myles Kennedy's vocals have never sounded better.  I am glad I got the MP3 album because I would have worn out the CD by now.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The writing and storyline of this novel are excellent.  I became instantly involved in the lives of the characters and eager to know what would happen next.  A great read!
B00003CXB2|5.0|Adventure,  ideals, action, beautiful scenery, suspense, music, script. This film has it all. Highly recommend. Never tire of watching this masterpiece.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|This new Netflix series starts out with an absorbing story and just keeps getting better.  I highly recommend it to all because of its wonderful complex storyline, excellent acting and realistic setting of the United States Congress.<br />I'm hooked!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 4.2 / 5<br />video - 4.2 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />good superman movie, great video and audio on this blu ray.<br />a must have for superman fans, as i can't wait for the upcoming<br />sequel.<br />found the story to be interesting, good action and special effects.<br />recommended for your collection.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett --- and this novel made it clearer to me why I am such a big fan.<br />While writing about all of the major events of history in this era, Mr. Follett managed to make it real by describing their effects on his major characters.  The different families, and different countries made me &#34;see&#34; the big picture as never before.  I am eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the trilogy.
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|this review is made on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4.2 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />got a lot more than i expected, after all the bad reviews, found this movie to<br />be just as entertaining as olympus has fallen. guys, please don't compareit to any of the die hard movies<br />as it's very different.<br />great video and rockin' audio throughout.<br />recommended for you action fans.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|If you love the Dr. Quinn show, you will love this.  It also has extra's on some of the disks, such as a biography of Jane Seymour.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Very good<br />Love the book the whole series is a wonderful story. Its suspenseful and interesting it keeps me on my toes
B004SIP7F8|5.0|Fantastic movie, nine Oscars, so need I say more......??<br />  I have wanted to see this movie for years, never did, for reasons not now clear. My son thought I should see it and gave it to me recently, so even more recently I saw it, yesterday......!!<br />  Late in the day I usually fall asleep, sometimes in movies, with the result that a second viewing becomes mandatory. I can see why some people found it &#34;long&#34; or &#34;boring.&#34; I was almost there myself, but could not let go of conciousness, could not sleep, watched the whole thing, although it was not what I would call &#34;entertaining,&#34; but rather stunning, sad, in a Greek-like way, massively beautiful, with reminders of all kinds of other great material.......Lawrence, with more romance and less politics, Zhivago, with less clothe and more sand, Casablanca, with more outdoors and vaguer enemies, and so on.<br />  Spectacular filming and scenery, with more reasons not to go into the desert, and acting, by every single actor, that was perfect. I would love to hear actors comment on the making of this movie, and their views about making it. Was it an &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; boot camp, or a week in Beverly Hills.......?? I need an &#34;making of.....&#34; movie for this movie.....!!<br />  Well, well, I finally saw it, and will be adding it to the often watched list, with &#34;Ben Hur&#34; and &#34;Godfather,&#34; and hope those who found it tedious and boring, will continue to struggle getting through The Bible and Shakespeare. I know what, watch &#34;Out of Africa,&#34; then do the New Testament...............
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it was challenging at first but then it got very easy.<br />Inc  I got the hang of it everything was all right.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|So glad our book club facilitator suggested this read. A compelling story amazingly written. Not a light read however a very good one.
B005L38QHA|1.0|I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself. We created profiles and programmed the the mice. They worked as expected.  However they won't stay programmed. They would work great. Then we would leave the game and when we came back in the buttons, still showing to programmed, wouldn't work. We re-installed the drivers, as others have done, same thing over again.<br /><br />I went to Steelseries support. But I had to register, just to contact them. I have a bit of a problem with any web site that wants personnel information just to contact them. So I decided to return them and order the Razer mice.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|clean master is a great program for my kindle it lets me clear junk files and keep it fast it has helped me to be able to have more space and not have speed problems
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|john is now coming into his own i think he became seasoned when he sat in with eric clapton and jj cale on one of their ventures it is obvious on this cd that he learned something from those masters he has stepped up a solid notch and it is good
1250038820|5.0|Brandon Stanton has become one of my favorite people and photographers a few years back when i first discovered his amazing blog and facebook page.<br />The book is as great as the blog, and I'm very happy to own a \\"physical\\" entity of his work! rather than having to go online, being able to see the pictures in a book is a very different and enjoyable experience!<br />When is the next one coming out? :)
B008G3N71W|5.0|This is not my usual genre, but I‘m totally blown away. Professionally written, immediately absorbing and engaging, I forgot that I was reading erotica until Greta’s panties were ripped off. I became so hot on my commute that I couldn't read it on the train. Chloe Thurlow caught me completely off guard with her easy reading style, and face paced sexual tension. My heart raced as Greta explored her fantasies and let all her inhibitions go wild. A fantastic page-turner to the last page. I want more...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cute and fun if you love horses. a bit slow through tutorial have not gotten far yet but good so far. easy controls and good hints.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a masterful author, and Steelheart is further proof of this indisputable fact.<br /><br />Steelheart is a vision of a dark future, which you won't be able to put down from start to finish.<br /><br />Not just for superhero fans, Steelheart brings all the action of a Hollywood blockbuster, AND a breathtaking world of impressive depth, memorable characters, and burning questions that will leave you begging for the next installment in the series.<br /><br />I completely recommend Steelheart to people of all ages—even more so for young adults.<br /><br />Pick up a copy today, silence your mobile, and by tomorrow you'll be a die-hard fan.
B000007UTN|5.0|Hello everyone, and let me just say that this, like most Radiohead albums is superb, but, whom ever the factories are that are pressing these records are ruining them to the MAXIMUM! I don't know how many of you grew up with records, but they should not sound as if they are already used. You, the buyer should have the luxury of making your record purchase sound awful over time if you don't take care of it. For those of you who are new to records, and think that they should come with skips, ticks and pops already, you are mistaken! I have gone through three returns of this album, all of them sounding like crap. Even worse the third copy even had glue or something like that smeared on to the first track of the D-side. If you didn't know any better, and played that with all that gunk on the record it could potential ruin your needle! I don't think that Capitol Records, Parlophone Records or Amazon will be replacing your needle if it gets destroyed, do you?<br /><br />So let me make this short and sweet, Radiohead is awesome! Record pressing factories SUX, AND ARE RIPPING US OFF BY SELLING CRAP ALBUMS!!!!<br /><br />If you find yourself complacent and or apathetic, or both, and your O.K. with being sold crap, then send me your money and I'll gladly sell these piece of s*** sounding records. Come on, I know you like to waist your hard earned money!<br /><br />If you care, voice your opinion about these issues to the record labels. They should not be getting away with this Rip-Off Crap!<br /><br />LONG LIVE ANALOG!!!<br /><br />Note: Funny, this is almost the same review I gave for The Bends. The not so funny thing is that the experience with the two is almost identical! Which makes me wonder how many of you, since this album has sold like a bajillion, are just cool with this poor quality???
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|The game is so much fun. I play it all the time. It is great for a way to pass the time without wifi. Only some things do require wifi. But all in all it is great.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|I had never watched any of the Jason Bourne movies, but after watching Legacy and LOVING  it, I watched the three previous movies and really enjoyed them, especially the third one, which takes place the same time as Legacy.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Excellent modern take on sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes book series. Slight differences here and there but hardly noticeable.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Loved this movie!  Watched it several times to pick up all the information and nuances.  Not usually a Tom Cruise fan, but this movie was really good.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious and a really enjoyable movie. I wouldn't change a thing. It is perfect for the whole family. Get out the popcorn!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Love the banter between the characters. Its what keeps the show fresh and not just another run of the mill lawyer drama
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Splendid casting, masterful performances, enchanting stages... Why did it not win the Oscar to Best Picture? In my opinion, Les Mis&eacute;rables is clearly superior in every aspect to Argo.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works as advertised. Just follow the online setup. You do need a strong wi fi signal to watch streaming video.  Works great with my Samsung phone or my PC.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|The movie had an interesting mix of flavors.  Aspects of human extinction with a background of economic crisis.  The combat seemed to bring back a hint of the Godzilla fight scenes.  As action flicks go acting was good, of course if your watching an action flick, as long as its not terrible acting who really cares, right.  The story was good and did not breakdown.  If you are looking for a fun interesting movie this should do the trick.  PS I paid for a 24hr rental from Amazon, they gave it to me for 30 days...bonus.
B003L5BRXK|5.0|A lot of good gems on this one, well worth the 5.99 price.  Its good to hear Charlie (and Bill) but this remastered mix is too low on the guitars.  Especially Tumbing Dice, can barely hear the riff
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I would recommend this book it excellent for book club discussion. The epilogue is a necessary part of the whole story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this product will NOT cast proprietary video players, such as HBOGO and Showtimeanytime.  It will, however, cast video players which are embedded into the chrome browser, such as hulu and crackle.<br /><br />NOTE:  if you launch the video player out of Crackle, it will NOT play.  Why? ,, because the crackle video player is not (yet) supported with Chromecast. In order to 'cast' a video from Crackle you must stream it from Chrome, then expand your screen.  The fallback in doing this is that it consumes your laptop (or other PC) whereas you're not able to surf or perform other functions on your laptop while the video is playing.<br /><br />I'm guessing as time goes on the proprietary video players such as HBOGO, showtimeanytime, crackle and others, will eventually support chromecast, but as of today, 10/19/13, it does not.<br /><br />on the other had, it works great with Youtube, which my Roku doesn't support.  In a perfect world, there will be one product which will support ALL streaming sites.  Until then, there's a lot of money to be made by selling all these individual devices for each video site.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B003U4UOP4|5.0|Just thought I'd watch the last 3 seasons again.  Was just feeling a little LOST.  Totally enjoy the array of characters.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having a computer board  where I can post  my ideas and pics of things I love and everyone see it
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|They did a great job of adding updated storIes and themes while still honoring and even channeling Sir Arthur Connon Doyle.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|It's hard to rate a diet book without rating the diet. I never dieted before, as I love good food too much, but when I read about the fast diet, I thought it sounded like the thing I could do. And it turned out I was right. The diet itself is simple (fasting twice a week, and stick to fasting one day a week once you have reached your goal), the scientific research behind it pretty convincing. I feel great with it, and the book gives the whole background, including a bunch of recipes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so excited it's finally on Kindle! FINALLY!! I look seriously almost everyday for this app and its MINE!! Yes! Yes!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've enjoyed the game so far. Would like to see more levels soon! Seems a bit easy at this point, but am looking forward to more.
B005F9TQ2Y|2.0|This record is a step up from the three albums that came before it but that's not really saying much.  There are some interesting lyrics however that doesn't necessarily mean good songs.  Solid melodies and interesting musical phrases are few and far between on this record.  There are a couple of alright songs but the bad early eighties production and Dylan's worst singing to date make them hard to find. (I have a theory that he permanently damaged his vocal cords during the Rolling Thunder tour.  His voice certainly took a turn for the worst after that period.  Maybe it was too much back stage smoking, drinking, singing,etc?  It's Just a thought anyway.) The addition of former Rolling Stone Mick Taylor on guitar and Dire Straits head honcho Mark Knopfler on production and guitar somehow can't help things either.<br /><br />Dylan neophytes would do well to skip this album.  In fact skip his 80's output altogether. Start with the 60's, cherry pick the 70's, and then come back in with the mid 90's material. His output does eventually get better but sadly it also gets much worse before he turns it around.  I must say I am kind of surprised that anyone would give this record five stars.  Three maybe or an over zealous four from the worshiping fan. But five stars!? Really?  Even a die hard Dylan enthusiast would have to concede that this is not in the top tier of his material.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|The game is enjoyable to play, not as challenging as some, but interesting to see how many points you can build up to make changes to a room.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Decent graphics easy to play. Many options to choose from. Much better that the original. Well worth downloading this app.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The Micro Shell Folio case fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. It's lightweight and the color is exactly what I was looking for. It not only protects<br />my Kindle Fire but gives me the ability use it in a stand up position. Very happy with this item.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Is an amazing product, u can control everything from you phone. You only need a HDMI connection and chromecast  app, and ready to cast your phone.
B0055D3EFU|2.0|My girlfriend and I rented this movie because we wanted to see something scary, and for the first half, it was well on its way to becoming a very creepy and frightening movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like most horror movies. Once you hit the second half of the movie, it all starts going downhill from there. The make up for the main \\"ghost\\" was absolutely terrible and didn't illicit any fear. In fact, it was so bad, that you couldn't help but roll your eyes as to how bad the creature design was. The scary ghost old woman had the best make up of the bunch and was the scariest of them all, but she only shows up in a few scenes.<br /><br />Essentially, this movie is not as scary as one might hope. Its best moment was when the ghost was walking outside the house on the second floor and then suddenly it appeared inside the house and attacked the woman. THAT was scary, but is unfortunately, the ONLY scary part of this movie.<br /><br />This movie really could have knocked it out of the park. The editing, the shots, the atmosphere, everything was extremely well executed and definitely copied some of the scariest movies of our time. But once the second half with the psychic rolls around, it all goes down hill from there and makes you wonder, just what the hell happened? It's almost as if a different director or writer took over and threw the movie into the garbage. The second half of the movie is an absolute waste, and ruins what could have been an incredible, scary movie.<br /><br />You might get some enjoyment out of this movie if you watch the first half, but feel free to turn it off once the second half shows up.
0060763280|5.0|I've read that book before...perfect...I recommend. That's like you can be rich thinking by rich people think. Is easy to read and interesting. Good
B001UG4VWQ|2.0|I got this in the mail and found it is written in German and was concerned the whole movie was in German, but when I put it in my DVD player was informed it was not formatted to be used in America.  Boo!
031623480X|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter has managed to write a very readable book without sacrificing scientific explanations and documentation.  This book brings home that you are not fatalistically locked in from birth with cognitive or mental health levels.  Likewise, you need not remain a victim of the environmental damage you have done to your brain.  Through utilizing science to shape your future eating and lifestyle choices versus the folklore of the government food pyramid or &#34;my plate&#34;, you CAN reverse, and/or heal and/or improve your brain function - even dementia and Alzheimers.  This book is another important proof text for why we cannot rely on bureaucratic government to set standards concerning health and food, cholesterol and heart disease, global warming, cancer, etc.  Too often the government sacrifices factual scientific evidence to powerful economic interests.  READ this book if you want to begin or continue disentangling yourself from the figuratively poisonous food industry in the United States.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|love watching this with my kids and explaining to them that I used to watch this when I was little!
B009HOU672|3.0|Comparison with the original is inevitable.  The new treatment does not measure up to that standard. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..
B0017SWSCW|3.0|The book had some inventive, although implausible, events and plot. Character development was minimal. It seems to make the British justice system look inadequate.  There were enough twists to keep the reader engaged as long as one didn't think about it too much.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly was canceled after just one season. Way too soon. Watch and enjoy. Before he was Richard Castle he was the captain of the Firefly..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a Steven King fan since the first book of his that I read. ( the Stand) King's good and bad folks are clearly drawn and struggle to the end, with not all good characters surviving. This story pits a 13 year old young girl teamed  with a survivor of the SHINING story 20 years after that disaster. The villains are a band of zombie like vagabonds  that cruise the country to find clairvoyant humans to give them extended life.
0316204366|4.0|\\"Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him.\\" -- 1 Samuel 17:49-50 (NKJV)<br /><br />I enjoyed every single story in the book. Mr. Gladwell is a fine storyteller. My disappointment was that the book didn't provide more practical advice.<br /><br />There are three parts: the advantages of disadvantages (and the disadvantages of advantages), the theory of desirable difficulty, and the limits of power.<br /><br />In the first part, the title could just as easily be: misunderstandings about advantages and disadvantages. They key lesson actually comes from the first story about how an experienced basketball coach built a winning team around extreme defense ... because the team didn't have much else going for it: make the most out of whatever advantage you can gain. The most practical application came in the material about how it's better to go to a lesser college and be a star there than to not be a star at a more highly regarded college.<br /><br />In the second part, the title could just as easily be: slow down and notice what's going on. The examples show how concentration ... despite difficulties in doing so ... yields great insights and results.<br /><br />In the third part, the title could just as easily be: don't push people too far, they'll get stronger in resistance.<br /><br />So if you thought this book was going to give you some huge new insight from academia, I doubt if that will be the case. If you hoped to find some bit of practical advice for what to do differently, there's little past some good principles. The college lesson, however, is worth the price of the book for any high school seniors who will soon be making such decisions.<br /><br />Enjoy some fun reading!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love this movie~ And the fact that with Prime I can have access to it and watch great movies like this one. So entertaining and fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I want Mr Fellowes to write more great series like this one.  I am anxious to see season 4 and what things they have in store for their viewers!!
B004FGMV0W|4.0|I love Avril Lavigne and her music! This CD is very good. Not my favorite, but definitely part of my collection of good music. I got it very quick when I ordered, so it's good because I was expecting it soon!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 7 year old is so into Angry Birds. These games which I personally don't get into did however hold my kids attention and some aspects of the game teaches control of aiming skills. I recommend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I was looking for a Sim City type game and this one is super fun! Easy to learn. Great time waster.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, Hosseini crafts a love story worth reading in one sitting about characters who seem more real than reality TV personalities. He takes the reader to three different continents, all while telling the story of a bond broken in one family decades ago but miraculously sewn back together in present time, albeit with some frayed edges. Two Paris, three brothers and a mountain of secrets to climb over, this novel blossoms with emotion. Long live real, undying love.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I am known among my friends as a lover of ensemble casts. I completely adore the NCIS gang and will watch them until the bitter end.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I love all of these books! I can't wait to read the next one! I seriously recommend them to all!
B004U8VUQG|5.0|Definitely the best Scream movie in the series. A good thriller which will scare upcoming scary movie fans (kids) out of wanting to watch more of them!
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Thought provoking! Very tastefully done. Excellent job by all actors - moving & tugs at the heart! Very highly recommend!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is honestly the best book I've read in a long time. I would recommend this to any teen/preteen in love with a good real not fake lovey dovey love story but a realistic one.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Wow! Been meaning to see this since it came out! Most excellent movie! Heartwarming, funny, moving! A plus plus plus! Must see!
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Love, love, love it! Saw them on a late night show and just had to hear more of their music!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Although it is not a riveting story, Orphan Train definitely captures the heart of anyone who loves nd cares about children.  It is well written, and, as far as I can tell, historically accurate. It is a tale of survival in America's heartland.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Every new volume of the Bootleg Series provides surprises and unknown gems, Vol. 10 included. Thankfully, Bob Dylan has been able to leave behind those fans who sought to make him their guru and their muse. What's left, as always, is the music. Have a listen to a varied musical palate of old and new, and old made new.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This fun, a good time waster. Don't really like having to post a review to get to the next level though. Probably won't go with this developer again.
B004LR5K0I|4.0|While I've owned the 50's and 60's Masters for years, and received my first Elvis record in 1958, I'd not added the Essential 70's Masters to my collection until recently. The often-electrifying 50's and the 60's Elvis recordings were more essential for me. Dave Marsh's excellent essay helped me focus on the strengths of Elvis' 70's output. I agree with his key point, Elvis sang. His voice remained strong. Song production was clean and uncluttered. The backing musicians, James Burton et al., were tight. While I've always gravitated towards Elvis' mastery of rock and roll, I've been impressed by how well he served the lyrics in whatever genre he attempted.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King proves yet again why he is still the top name in horror. Sometimes I think he can write these \\"in his sleep.\\"
B004SIIBGU|2.0|It sucks on an android phone and it's not because of the phone. I love my phone. It sucks on a tablet as well. I use the full web version on my tablet.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Really enjoy this series of books .  Baldacci does it every time -  Great books  I stayed interested enough to read this book in two days!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I read Dracula every year and never grow tired of it! It is the quintessential vampire novel...a gothic horror masterpiece!!! A MUST READ!!! THE COUNT WILL BID YOU WELCOME AND DRAIN YOU DRY!
B007W4F6M4|5.0|I haven't seen the movie in years but it is still a classic with a dark sense of humor and some social commentary.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Maya's entire life for the 12 years she has worked for the CIA has been to find Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain has the role of a lifetime as Maya and plays her brilliantly. You can't take your eyes off of her as she follows every lead, interrogates suspects who may have information and begs for the backup she needs when clues begin to add up. There is a stellar cast (I absolutely LOVE the actors who play the Navy Seals...every one of them!) that lends credibility to this wonderful movie. It truly gives you an idea of the difficulty of finding Bin Laden and the tiniest and myriad leads that had to be followed. It is a &#34;watch it every time I see it is on cable&#34; kind of movie! I highly recommend it!
B00CXQL828|5.0|Can ya beat a better team of players?  NO!  I just saw them perform this disc basically straight through in Denver at The Soiled Dove and they just killed it.  As per usual, Ritchie's tunes are right on point here (lyrically & vocally especially).  This is an amazing disc...BUT IT NOW!
B004LWZW9C|3.0|I FINALLY figured out why it was so difficult to care about the characters in this movie, to really get lost in the movie itself.  There were SO many different little stories involving different characters (sub-plots?), and they were so short and choppy!  The humor was very forced, and most of the characters seemed uncomfortable in their roles.  This was a lot along the lines of Valentine's Day, but that was a better movie with more character sympathy.  A huge \\"A List\\" cast made the trip more enjoyable but couldn't bring the film up to an \\"A\\" movie.  It is a fun bit of fluff!
B009A87X80|1.0|What can I say? Eva Cassidy has the voice of an Angel and plays lovely guitar. This compilation contains some of the best cover versions of some incredible material. This CD is pure Joy to listen to.....
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a wonderful documentary of the Eagles from seeing how their group was formed, to the break up, to the reunification....and everything in between.  The music is worth the price of the DVDs, but to watch how they write their songs, how they had to fight their management for decision-making status, how a few members came and went is fascinating.  We even get to see who and how the cover art for an album was made.  This is another &#34;movie&#34; that I watch every time I see that it is on cable!  It's a must-see!
B00004YZFR|1.0|What a wonderful documentary recording of the unfortunate Altamount incident occurring during the Rolling Stones appearance there back in the late 60's. Well-shot and well-made. A must-have for any serious Stones fan.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book changed the entire way I relate to the world and other people.  It's amazing what compassion can accomplish. Approaching every human situation from the standpoint of feelings which point to needs, changes everything.  Highly recommend this book.
B0000DC13U|1.0|What a package! The making-of, the background, the whole process of putting together one incredible Stones tune, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". Plus, the avante-garde use of Eldridge Cleaver's book, \\"Soul On Ice\\"--what a psychedelic touch.....Totally win-win!
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|It is not The Cure, but I bought this for my daughter. She loves it.<br />It is not utterly unlistenable.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was a easy read. Good storyline told through someone who has no social skills, but is highly academic. It's probably too simplistic when it comes down to analysing peoples DNA in a certain timeframe.Get on your bike and let the author set the pace. Enjoyable.
B0052FDRI0|5.0|It is not Depeche Mode, but I bought this for my daughter. She loves it.<br />It is not utterly unlistenable.
B000BJ7BCA|4.0|My 10 year old gives it 3 stars, my 7 year old gives it 4.  So... There ya go!  Personally, I liked the music (they remade a lot of music that was popular when I was a teenager), and it was pretty funny here & there.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|In this day and age of film production this is no better than the godzilla movies I used to watch on Saturdays in the 70's. Lame monsters. Lame special effects. Lame acting. Lame directing. Lame, lame, lame.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game that I love to play all of the time plus it works on a kindle fire.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Love this movie. Great cast. Clever dialogue. Funny without being too cliche or it's able to laugh at it's cliche in an intelligent way. Whatever, I was totally entertained and laughted alot. And Red II is off the charts even funnier. I made the mistake of watching it on a plane and had to physically control myself from laughing out too loud so as to not disturb the other passengers. That was really hard to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I play it every day. It's fun because you can never get bored. That's why I like this game
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Another Zombie movie. 50 years of zombie movies. Kinda hard to have a very high expectation of a new zombie movie. Surprisingly, it delivers on the suspense and there are some limited good special effects. Every thing else is just kinda the same stuff. For whatever reason, it reminded me way too much of I Am Legend and Outbreak. Admittedly, I am not a zombie movie buff, but this movie begs me to ask a question: I know we are to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but it bugs me that the characters here point out that the zombies are dead bodies, not living tissue, so they can't be infected with another bacteria or virus, but no one ever asks how such a dead body is able to move and run way faster, and longer than a live body and how they can defy gravity and physics and every other law that live bodies adher too. Blah
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very compelling & heartwarming.  I couldn't put it down!  The writing was thoughtful, funny, sad, and inspiring! I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B007HO392S|5.0|She ventured away from some of her normal songs in this one.  A few are a little dark, but you'll be singing along in no time!  Two Black Cadillacs and Wine After Whiskey are favorites.  It was a nice change for her, but still so &#34;Carrie&#34;!
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Excellent Show! One of the top new shows! Highly recommended! Don't miss. Addictive show....incredible acting! I cannot wait for the second season!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|I enjoy playing this game very much! It's cute, funny and addictive! Moving around is a little stiff but you get used to it. I need more levels lol....
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This story begins in the decade prior to World War II, in a small town in Czechoslovakia called Bratislava, and follows two families through the war. I've read several books over the years written both by survivors and first hand accounts of witnesses to the tragedies and atrocities committed during the Holocaust. It was obvious to me from the attention to detail in the story that the author was meticulous in his research. The minutiae of everyday life somehow made the events portrayed much more real to me. Sometimes I feel disconnected when I read, that wasn't the case here. I was grateful for the slow pace at which the story moved in the beginning; it gave me time to absorb what was happening and develop a connection to the characters.<br /><br />Fischer accurately portrays the cares and concerns of life in this time period for people living both in the city and the country. That attention to detail is reflected in the daily lives of the Weissensteiners and Winkelmeiers. Greedy men gobbled up land and possession that had been taken from Jews without regard for the hardships their former owners had to endure because of that loss.<br /><br />Fischer captures the tension Jews felt as Hitler's armies pressed closer to Bratislava. Wilma's fear after being attacked on the bridge is palpable. The fear of being discovered as Jewish was very real and the penalties were stiff. I couldn't agree with the Winkelmeiers sending Greta and Ernst back to her family. After all, they were his grandparents. But they too had a very real fear of being discovered in the act of harboring and protecting their Jewish daughter-in-law and grandson.<br /><br />What Fischer accomplished for me that no other author to date has, was present how rational, thinking people could possibly accept the lies they were being fed about the Jewish people in a way that I could almost understand. That has always confused me. Yet, as I watched how Wilhelm responded to the allegations, and gradually began accepting them, I developed an understanding of how thorough the Hitler propaganda machine really was.<br /><br />This was not a comfortable nor easy book to read. Given the subject matter, I don't think it should be. I was at times tense, nervous, scared, relieved and hopeful. Although I wasn't able to read the book through without putting it down and getting some distance from the story, I am still giving it five stars. The story affected me deeply and helped me to understand a little better a very dark time in human history.<br /><br />For me, this is a must read book. We should never forget what was done to so many millions of people. Fischer has given a voice to a sector I'd not yet heard from in this era. Well researched, well written, well edited. An excellent story. I would definitely read the other books in this series. I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B002VECM72|5.0|All enjoyed the presentation. It was clear and crisp and the price was certainly right for my budget this time.  Good flick.......JCI
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It used to be great but now every time I try to go on it it says v tube has stopped. What gives?
B007EC27QM|3.0|I played with this calculator for about 30 seconds before I realized it's just a regular calculator with a few added functions. The stock calculator on my device does way more.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Love the movie. One of our family favorites. Love the soundtrack and the storyline is clever. Very pleased with purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like others I have long awaited to play the game others have raved about!  Hurray!  It's finally here!  It's fun fun fun!
B005SAP45I|4.0|I was expecting more racing like the original but it still was a good movie. Didn't keep my son's attention for too long though.
B002N57KG2|4.0|Burt Reynolds and Don DeLuise are very FUNNY in this movie, although I don't think<br />the ENDING matches the story line's excitement and laughs.  Buy it, and try it....you WILL<br />like it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It is wonderful to see a show about people and their problems, not shoot them up and violent car scenes.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book! This book was enjoyed by all in our book club.  So interesting that is is actually part of our little known American history.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Me and my sister love this game and we were looking  for a new game and wow we saw this game we immediately got it
B00F5F140U|5.0|Love it. Such a privilege to have such gifted<br />artist, such as these. Elton John you have another great album!
B0089LOG02|4.0|This novel introduced events in US history that I was not aware, Orphan Trains.  It was both nteresting and educational.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Iour daughter has every year starting with year 2 and she loves her entire collection.  It is her gift from dad and she looks forward to each new doll.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I laughed, I cried; I love the story of Cat and Bones. Now,  on to the next book. Can't wait.
B004K00NEO|5.0|It is the first DVD our grandson will wear out.  He is almost 2 and lives bots so this movie is a daily showing
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i really like the details about the battery this app shows. it doesnt just show the charge but length of time for different activities. i recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a pretty fun game but I really wish there were more levels. I finished the whole game in one day.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This is a movie more for girls than guys but guys can enjoy it as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has proven to be a very good actor.He's interesting in what ever part he plays.Pairing him with Zoe Deschannel ( I'm sure I spelled her name wrong) works very well.Watch this flick with your girlfiend and she'll see your more than just a macho man.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I tend to install all sorts of calculators always hoping to find the best of the best.  When it comes to simple fractions though, I've yet to find one better than this.<br />I do a lot of measuring for doing remodeling projects and other things,  and while I am good at doing the math,  this does help when my mind is just not in the game.<br />Great job Digitalchemy.
B0028R3G5O|5.0|There really is not much more to say, all the great songs are here, i listen all this time in the car and sing along!!!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|easy to read, I finished it after all<br /> helps remind you to be positive, look for the best in life<br />the tests did not all work but interesting trying
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|Calling it \\"for Android\\" is very deceiving as it does not work on other Android device except for the Kindle devices. Also this version is so buggy and it can not even handle most of MP4 videos which can be played on an old HTC Inc2.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Each book gets better and better! Can not wait to get to the end and see how it all turns out.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Amazing book. Great characters, in depth and interesting world, and begins to move away from the Harry Potter feel that I got in the first book, in a very good way!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Downton Abbey. The writing is excellent for a &#34;posh soap&#34;. A viewer can expect something great from every episode and be excited for the following.
B001MTENOC|5.0|As a former atheist and general skeptic, I related well to this book. You don't have to believe everything, and you won't if you are an atheist today, but give it a try n over the next few years things might happen that may change your mind. A book started me on such a journey and though it didn't convert me in a day, it helped me be a better human being to start with. This is one of those books that can add meaning to your life. It won't tell you why you are here, but it may help you remember that you are here for a reason.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It Hard to work with but it does work when you get the hang of it , it just takes a lot of time and a lot of  bottles. Shipped in good time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting a while for this to be available on my Kindle Fire, so was pleased when it was offered for free.  I have played and played this game as it is quite addicting.  Love,  love the music.
B007EC27QM|5.0|What sold me is the way it lets you use the percent function.  Plus you can't beat the price.  You should get it.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Interesting enough to keep me coming back; interesting layouts; and good look. Mahjong II is better though. good graphics for me
B0087OXDDC|4.0|Basically the same approach but with one big difference: the book has a lot of nice examples that illustrate every single phrasal verb. And that's great. I really like the book.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|If I could I would only rate it 3½ stars - and average Sanderson book with an great idea as basis.<br /><br />Feels like it's missing some depth in the story.<br />Personally I think Sanderson have a bit too many projects and this book feels like an great idea build around some Sanderson generic character build.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|Okay we can all say we new it happened to view it first hand is another story. Wish I had seen this after the tsunami so I would have donated more than what I did. This movie was great. I watched on the airplane which was not such a good idea I was crying like a baby.The acting is beyond good although I never heard about this movie I am so glad I purchased it . I do not recomend this movie for children. WOW!
B005CRQ2XA|3.0|This book is the best book ever if anybody looks at this book they should stop looking at it and just read it trust me it is a good book!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally I can play candy crush on my kindle..Love it. Easy to download and its just the same as on your pc.  Addicted
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Some people will love this album, some won't, especially those who don't really know and understand music and songwriting. Its rare that people love all songs on an album. At best there's a couple of favorites and the rest are very listenable. Sometimes, you get a gem on an album, which stands out very far from the other songs. Most of Paul's new songs are very listenable and become more so after many listens. I'm not going to review each song but I do want to mention 3 of my favorites. \\"Early Days\\" is my clear cut winner and my personal gem, even though I do understand that some people will not like the shifts in Paul's voice. But this is a great song, not only for the music but also for the story it tells about Paul and his friend John. I've always felt Paul has wanted to let people know how important John was to him. He sings his beautiful \\"Here Today\\" tribute to John at every concert, often getting very emotional after all this time. \\"Early Days\\" is not so much a tribute, but a fond remembering of his friend and the times they shared. I think its a great song. \\"Turned Out\\" was a pleasant bonus surprise--catchy song with a nice message. \\"Scared\\" was another pleasant bonus surprise--simple and beautifully written, with Paul sounding very much like 71. Paul has the ability to write achingly and momentarily beautiful musical notes and melodies and you can hear them in this song.<br />Paul doesn't need a pass even though he's 71. He still can write better music and outperform most, if not all of the talent out there. God, I hope I can walk at 71! As I recently wrote about Elton John, Paul won't be with us forever (I think) so enjoy this iconic treasure while he's still with us. Buy the album and listen and send Paul back some of the love he continues to give us after all these years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting 4 this game to be in app store from the day candy crush had just came out for android and apple
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|After an afternoon of repeat listens I'm impressed by Paul McCartney's New cd.  I'm a lifelong second generation fan.  At this point I buy every cd, though I considered stopping in the late 80s and early 90s.  IMHO, ever since The Beatles Anthology McCartney's work has matured.  There are fewer underdeveloped songs; and the lyrics seem more reflective and less cliched.  Expect the same here.  At this point, Early Days' Beatle reflections risk seeming cliched; but McCartney presents it in a way that keeps the topic personal and revealing.  And the CD's love songs focus on his own vulnerability more than on romanticized declarations about his loved one.  After one day I haven't mastered each song's nuance; but I already can appreciate it enough to recognize that it's the thoughtful reflections of a mature mind.  Musically, it seems influenced by Electronic Arguments.  At least, many of the songs have an electronic sound.  But its not a CD filled with synth music.  There are plenty of guitars here.  That this CD has four producers hints at its sonic range.  But it's not a disjointed collection, a mismatch of sounds.  It sounds like a sonic quilt, with different sounds sketched together by McCartney and Martin (the son).  Lastly, I recommend getting the Deluxe Edition.  It has three (not just two.  The unlisted track comes at the end and is called Scared) bonus tracks, worth the extra investment.  In fact, I love Get Me Out of Here, a whimsical and yet reflective tune during which McCartney playfully declares \\" Get me out of here.  I'm a celebrity.\\"  He's always been able to laugh at himself.  I'm not sure if there are any standards here; and I'm suspect Chaos will remain my favorite recent CD; but New is a joy of a CD.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Easy to use. Adjust the volume of each sound to fit your taste. Save to play next or create a new one the following night to suit your needs.
0345529057|4.0|I bought this set a few months ago for myself and then I bought another set for my best friend's Birthday. I REALLY enjoyed these books! Each one is well-crafted and full of vivid detail. I do have to say that the very last book in this box, A Feast for Crows, was a little slow, but the book after it was GREAT! These books are not for the light-hearted though. They are graphic and lengthy, so if you're looking for a casual read, I do not recommend them. But if you're a bookworm like me, the read away!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I hate that it's got DIET in the name - as I think is a huge lifestyle change - and not just a diet.  For anyone who seriously wants to get healthy again (or improve their health), this book and the prescription is a must
B002UNMW7O|5.0|This one will help explain the first one if you're confused. Lots of fun, violence and bad lanquage too. Most sequals aren't this good. This is the exception to the rule. Great casting both times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|We want more! The characters, the storyline, the mud the blood and the tears. What a slice of a post-apocalyptic world. Finely crafted with people you care deeply about. We need to know what is next...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The undisputed King of the horror genre!<br /><br />His are the only &#34;real&#34; books I still buy-everything else I buy on the Kindle, but I MUST own and hold Stephen King's books. It's the best part of my day when I can buy yet another new Stephen King book and the worst part of my day when I finish it and have to wait for the next novel.<br /><br />Kudos to you, sir, from your Constant Reader.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is great for everyone. It's an amazing recreation of what it felt like with the 1970s/80's, and mixed with the future. I recommend this book to everyone, but especially teens.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My 98 year old grandfather has only 10% of his hearing left. He wears the most expensive hearing aids but still has trouble. I purchased this for him thinking \\"what the heck,\\" and it works wonders!! It has helped him tremendously, and his family as well (we don't have to yell so loud!). And if he says it helps, it must really work!
B007T99ENE|4.0|There is something unique about the way this author engages the reader with the characters in his books, whether they are likable or not. He creates an intimacy with the protagonists personality and a tension in the narrative that is most compelling. Have you read this yet Shelley Seid?
B00B7Y0206|5.0|As always, I am pleased with the YouTube app. I always works well and I never have any complaints. .
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This season was a good character study with some history setting to get you in the proper frame of mind.  Most of the hanging plots were resolved, but the season left us with a good cliffhanger
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|As usual, Dream Theater delivers again. Every two years I wait for another cd from them and I'm never disappointed. Great drumming, intense music, a fine effort again.
B000KIRT6A|3.0|Didn't really accomplish the results that I was anticipating.  Not neccessarily the fault of the unit, but more what I was actually looking for in regards to other advice.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I didn't see the first 3 seasons of Greys Anatomy, so getting it on Amazon Prime is terrific. The series is, as a lot of you know, quite wonderful at mixing exciting medical situations with interesting personal relationships and the cast and production are among the very best. The later seasons reference many things from season 1, so watching it is doubly rewarding. Highly recommended.
B008M721MS|5.0|I have always loved Skype. I was one of its first users, as I was assigned 86 foreign assignments. After a very short time you are making normal expressions and motions as if you were in the room with that person that you so care about. PLEASE get this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Go go go go go try it you will enjoy using it<br />I love the recipes and tattoos I have family on pinterest.
193700788X|2.0|The plot was weak, with many holes in it. I don't care who Sookie ended up with, but there should have been more of a concrete build up towards Sam as her potential lover. The seal sex description was frankly, disgusting and disturbing, as bad as the worst fan fiction. Ms. Harris can do better.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|There were so many characters that I had a difficult time getting them all straight.  Good story though, and surprising ending, very interesting.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|It was good solid entertainment. It had a little bit of everything. I'm looking forward to the next movie in the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but it makes you review it to keep playing. Obviously I like it otherwise I wouldn't be here reviewing it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie was fun to watch, but in my opinion, it had a lot of holes in the plot. The ending could have been better and more explanatory.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is perfect for a rainy day, or just a relaxing read.  I enjoyed it immensely.<br />Stephen King at his most electrifying.  If you read the prequel you MUST get this, also.<br />It gives an ending to the first book; The Shining, then read Doctor Sleep, which is exactly<br /> what I intend to do.  It will blow your mind.  The world needs a Doctor Sleep.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is awesome but it needs to stop just working great then saying \\"mystery manor is not responding force close \\"
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He never disappoints. I read the book cover to cover over the weekend and loved every word. Stephen King is a genius. The story is perfection!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found it to be entertaining. I started reading SciFi as a teenager and at 61 still enjoy a well thought out plot which I felt this series had. I will probably read more by this author.
1452126577|5.0|I loved this book! Her opinions on various topics are hilarious (&#34;This is cactus. He's just a cactus with googly eyes. He's okay I guess.&#34;) and she stay's true to her Grumpy roots. If her owners ever decide to give her up, I'll take her in a heartbeat. Get your Grump on!
B00009AOBI|5.0|Great movie, great picture quality and super fast shipping. I would highly recommend to anybody wanting to see a great movie. Young or old. Enjoy everybody.
B00064WSOQ|5.0|Released in 2003, KC's `The Power to Believe' features the same Fripp-Belew-Gunn-Mastelotto quartet as its immediate predecessor `The Construkction of Light'. Here the band plays with a conviction and mastery of its material not quite achieved since the mid-70s Wetton-Cross period.<br /><br />The musical forms are concise and exacting in structure and yet allow for intelligent improvisations, with plenty of light and shade. These guys are not just good, they're REALLY good. The foursome gels perfectly and obviously enjoys playing together.<br /><br />It can take several listens before this music starts to make sense, so persist. Soft melodious mood pieces alternate raunchy, full-throttle KC-rock with the sound `turned ap to eeleven' to shake the window frames, jumping around between different time signatures and keys and yet all making perfect sense. `Dangerous Curves' is one of the band's most powerful and energetic pieces, and Adrian Belew continues to write with finely observed critical wit about the modern social landscape (especially on `Happy with what you have to be happy with').<br /><br />Good to see that after 40 years the KC project is still ahead of the game and making such great music, preserving an inventiveness and originality rarely heard elsewhere.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|John Legend covers the spectrum of emotions with a nice mixture of uptempo tracks and thoughtful ballads. I haven't taken it out of the CD player yet!( a month later)
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Just wonderful movie and the music is addictive.  Madonna did great.  Love the history and the scenes.  I can watch this movie over and over.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I must say all the characters were well acted. Of course the show was well put together. The character were great.
B00AC8ZIXO|1.0|I hope the video game is a hell of alot better than this crap.  Horrible acting!!  Poor plot, poor sotry line, poor visual effects, what else can I say.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY!! Can't stop cheering! Thank you Amazon I've been waiting so long for candy crush to be playable on my kindle. Works wonderfully! I am a very happy camper :)  Even more addictive!! Love it
B00DJZR46G|4.0|I love Elton John, but all the songs are slow and contemplative. I could have used a couple of rockin' songs like the ones on The Union.
0399255370|5.0|This is the funniest kids' book I've come across in awhile. My daughter lives it and its an endless source of amusement for me to hear her 'read' it to us, complete with voices for each crayon.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. DVD's work great! Very compact case, which is good for my DVD shelf( I'm running out of room) :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was hooked from the very first episode! Can't wait until season four starts! We feel like they are our family, lol!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I didn't think that I would like a movie on the cloud, but now I can watch this whenever I want. It's great.
B007EC27QM|4.0|It has nice interface, I like its simplicity. It has all the basic features which are you need im daily life. So overall fantastic calculator.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|If you were ever curious about the Grateful Dead ( and you know you are ) this concert will set you straight. Well, not exact;y straight. This is the band in their glory in 105 degree heat with alot of hot hippies dancing, drinking smokin and having a real good time. With it you get 3 High Quality CD'S great for goin down the road feelin'good AND a DVD of the 1972 concert in Oregon its self, which was a benefit for Ken Kesey & his Merry Pranksters including Neal Cassidy. Get on the bus , Gus. ENJOY !
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've been a Daft Punk fan for a while.  When the album was released, I listened to the sample tracks on Amazon & thought it sounded cheesy.  After my brother told me it was actually a great album, I looked it up on youtube to hear a few full tracks.<br /><br />I LOVED it!!  This album is pure audio endorphins!  It's like 70's funk met 80's 8-bit in a discotheque run by robots.  Definitely recommend it!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This was another great Follett book. His characters are so real, it seems like this must have been the way it actually happened.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|When this was on normal TV, I thought eh, not my style.  When my husband decided to try it recently through amazon, I was really caught up in it.  A woman who was strong enough, observant and able to do what was necessary.  A good show
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love this game have it on my smart phone and kindle. Prefer android edition but kindle is good too. Play daily. Very addictive.
B00FPH6A70|3.0|I like a good scary flick that is not a slasher movie, and I wanted to see this movie at the theater after hearing so much hype.  So I waited for the DVD and purchased it without thinking about renting it.<br /><br />It was only okay, not terrible, but only okay.  It did not live up to the hype.  It is probably the best of recent 'paranormal investigation/exorcism' based movies, but that sub-genre is so very played out.  I was hoping for something.....different.<br /><br />For an idea of what I think are examples of great horror films.<br />Changeling<br />Exorcist<br />The Shining<br />The Thing<br />Alien<br /><br />I don't think of slasher movies as horror.  This movie was not a slasher film. ****edited****
B00008HCCF|5.0|One only has to see and hear Norah play and they will be drawn into the music and walk away, if they can, wanting to hear more.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it has<br /> the best graphics freedom to do what u want and build what u want and play offline I'm every additional Ted to it I say it's a must have game
B0016MJ6HY|5.0|What a cast, so many great well known actors.  Also a very relateable storyline, but with an &#34;adventurish&#34; twist in the part played by Norah Jones.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  Knowing Norah as a musician, I was wondering how she would be in a movie.  But after seeing the trailer, and then watching the movie, I was amazed at how great an actor she was in her part.  Would love to see her in more movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It's very funny, very thought provoking, very genuine, and very sad. All at the same time. I'm going to miss it.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Even though it says the interest level is for upper grades, I'm in 8th grade and still loved it. It was so sad at the end though. :(
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Timothy Ferris is great, love his books. Not a book you can read cover to cover without stopping and thinking, Wow I really can do this!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like temple run and subway surfer mixed together but as lot better<br />Just like a boss pro btw game is great I would recommend it to everybody
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I was not disappointed with season 2 of the Tudor's. Again the portrayal by the actors of the rich tapestry of the life and times of Henry the 8th  was excellent and kept me enthralled from beginning to end!<br />Could not wait to see each episode !
B000V1US2S|4.0|I heard Diana in Buenos Aires and will always prefer on  records (to inexpressive on stage)<br />This records.combine excellent jazz pierces with romantic last titles.<br />Special mention toLittle girl blue.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Absolute 5 star rating!!!<br />The actors gave a sterling portrayal of the life of Henry the 8th and the life and times of the court of Henry the 8th.<br />Entertaining, captivating. Could not wait to watch Season 2!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Without a doubt this book will forever be one of my favorites. Once you start reading it, you won't want to stop.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I read this book not knowing until almost the end whether I liked it. By the end I liked it. I also ordered the second book and while it was hard to get into I enjoyedit.
B005JABU82|5.0|Exactly what I expected just perfect and yeah some parts are really small and loose but overall its great model no more complaints
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've just re-read this book and fell in love with it over again. Brilliantly written, suggested to all! Really a great read.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|A seemingly  lovely town and an injured man wanting to leave. What is crazy. What is not.  Although the physical endurance of the main character is tiresome at times, nothing else is in this mysterious, dangerous town. Intense and addictive.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is a very nice album with pretty songs in it.  I particularly liked the her version of &#34;O HOLY NIght.&#34;  I would recommend this album for holiday use.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Promotes networking from your favorite armchair or desk.<br /><br />Keeps members abreast of current events in their particular field of interest. Allows members to keep in touch.
0788859544|5.0|Excellent service - delivered as promised and in excellent new condition. Granddaughter love it and have enjoyed watching it over and over.  Great entertainment value for all to watch together.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|It seems that this album is a little bit of Cher wrapped into one pleasant package. We hear hints of past albums such as &#34;Cher (1987)&#34;, &#34;Heart of Stone&#34;, &#34;Love Hurts&#34;, &#34;Believe&#34;, &#34;Living Proof&#34;, & even &#34;Take Me Home&#34;. The ballads are incredible as Cher has really perfected her unrecognizable vocals to reach notes both high & low with her beautifully controlled vibrato. My favorite on the album is &#34;I Walk Alone&#34;, and it's no wonder she chose the title of the album &#34;Closer to the Truth&#34; from the lyrics of this song. It's all at once devastating, powerful, and uplifting. Much like Cher's career, I do believe we are closer to the truth. But I'm glad we aren't there yet. She still has much to give!
0812932293|5.0|Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- &#34;There was a great sense of teamwork within our family. Whenever we were within Mum's orbit we had to be busy. If we tried to escape by saying that we had something else to do, we were firmly told we were selfish. As a result we grew up with a clear priority of putting other people first.&#34;<br /><br />2- &#34;Later, it became apparent to me that business could be a creative enterprise in itself. If you publish a magazine, you're trying to create something that is original, that stands out from the crowd, that will last and, hopefully, serve some useful purpose. Above all, you want to create something you are proud of. That has always been my philosophy of business. I can honestly say that I have never gone into any business purely to make money. If that is the sole motive then I believe you are better off not doing it. A business has to be involving; it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.&#34;<br /><br />3- &#34;In the many different business worlds I have inhabited since that night in prison, there have been times when I could have succumbed to some form of bribe, or could have had my way by offering one. But ever since that night in Dover prison I have never been tempted to break my vow. My parents had always drummed into me that all you have in life is your reputation: you may be very rich, but if you lose your good name you'll never be happy. Th( The thought will always lurk at the back of your mind that people don't trust you. I had never really focused on what a good name truly meant before, but that night in prison made me understand.&#34;<br /><br />4- &#34;It is always difficult to admit to a failure, but the one positive thing about the Event episode was that I realized how important it was to separate the various Virgin companies so that, if one failed, it would not threaten the rest of the Virgin Group. Event was a disaster, but it was a contained disaster. Every successful businessman has failed at some ventures. and most entrepreneurs who run their own companies have been declared bankrupt at least once. Rather than defaulting on our debts, we paid them up and shut down the magazine.&#34;<br /><br />5- &#34;It was one of our early acquisitions, and it gave us first-hand experience of all the pain that comes with laying off staff in order to turn a company round. It also demonstrated the benefits of growing a company from scratch, when you employ exactly those people you want, and really f establish the kind of atmosphere you want.&#34;<br /><br />6- &#34;In the same way that I tend to make up my mind about people within thirty seconds of meeting them, I also make up my mind about whether a business proposal excites me within about thirty seconds of looking at it. I rely far more on gut instinct than researching huge amounts of statistics. This might be because, due to my dyslexia, I distrust numbers, which I feel can be twisted to prove anything.&#34;<br /><br />7- &#34;As well as the constrictions of having to report to nonexecutive directors and shareholders, one of my main i frustrations with being a public company quoted on the stock market was the short-term view which investors took. We were under pressure to produce instant results, and unless we paid out a large dividend our share price would suffer. Japanese investors do) not invest with the dividend payment in mind; they look almost exclusively for capital growth. And, given that it can take a long time for investments to pay off. Japanese share prices are very high in comparison i with the company's earnings.&#34;<br /><br />8- &#34;It sometimes seems to me that I have spent all my life trying to persuade bankers to extend their loans. Given that Virgin's policy has always been to reinvest our surplus cash back into the business, our profit and loss accounts understate the underlying value of the businesses. This policy has workedover the long term. but whenever there is a crisis it disguises the real picture and means that the banks worry about our short-term profits and ability to pay our immediate interest.&#34;<br /><br />9- &#34;Obstinate as I am, I recognized that there is a time to back down. 'Live for the present -' I heard my parents' old maxim in the back of my head '- and the future will look after itself.'&#34;<br /><br />10- &#34;You just need to look at where Virgin is now to see that business is a fluid, changing substance. As far as I'm concerned, the company will never stand still. It has always been a mutating, indefinable thing and the past few years have demonstrated that.&#34;<br /><br />11- &#34;My vision for Virgin has never been rigid and changes constantly, like the company itself. I have always lived my life by making lists: lists of people to call, lists of ideas, lists of companies to set up, lists of people who can make things happen. Each day I work through these lists, and it is that sequence of calls which propels me forward.&#34;<br /><br />12- &#34;In some ways it all boils down to convention. As you might have noticed, I do not set much store by such so-called wisdom. Conventionally, you concentrate on what you are doing and never stray beyond fairly narrow boundaries when running a company. Not only lo I find that restrictive, I also think that it's dangerous. If you only run record shops and refuse to embrace change, when something new like the Internet is launched you will lose your sales to the person who makes use of the new medium. It's far better to set up your own Internet operation to which your record shops lose business than lose it to somebody else's Internet operation.&#34;over the long term. but whenever there is a crisis it disguises the real picture and means that the banks worry about our short-term profits and ability to pay our immediate interest.&#34;<br /><br />9- &#34;Obstinate as I am, I recognized that there is a time to back down.

B008EL25LE|3.0|Not what I was thinking it would be it is a fun game, but the story bores me wish I could skip it, also exist there was a delete/undo button
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game it's addictive but not on it all day, as I don't spend on it, just go and do something else while energy is being restored
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing Mystery Manor for about a week now and thoroughly enjoy it. It provides a great distraction for passing time while not being boring or monotonous. Also, the quests keep things interesting and making friends is fairly easy. You don't have to spend any actual money on the game unless you choose to, which is also nice. Overall a fun addition to my collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a challenge and its fun you can go head to head with friends you go to different levels and places
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Simple game but hard to master. Interesting. My 4  year old has trouble getting the hang of it. Addictive but not hard to put down and pick up later.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I love this series.  It always seems to give you just enough of everything, edge of your seat suspence, love, relationship issues.  I like the parts tha leave you saying &#34;didnt see that comimg&#34;.  I do not always like the cliff hangers but it all works out and that is what keeps me coming back for more.  There are not enough words and I hope theybkeep up the good work.
074401493X|4.0|Tells you where all comics, pendants, and other collectibles are. The hardcover and key-chain are a nice addition as well. Really great guide overall, If the key-chain isn't a must though, I'd pick up a copy used.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Yeah ok it might be fun but it takes forever to freaking download its not worth your time so DON'T GET IT.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This is like a fallen souffle.  Lots of obvious hard work in the writing that shows a foundation without substance.  Nothing but supposition of what didn't happen.  Well researched and written, but it falls flat.  At the conclusion, you wonder why you bothered to read and why he bothered to write.  Save your money.  -  fa
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love kik it was my fast way  or talking to people that I didn't want to talk to in person and now ..... IT DON'T FUDGEING WORK!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not enough stars to rate appropriately.  This is the best King has ever been.  He is revisiting old ground and doing one hell of a landscaping job.  It's like reading your very first King opus.  You will not sleep until the Doctor is finished.  -  fa
B007EC27QM|4.0|SIMPLE AND EASY. Better then the first calculator I got. Nice buttons and not challenge complicated at all. Great for on the go.
B009C7JS14|3.0|I was hoping for up to the minute radar, didn't see that feature yet.  also wanted futurecast,,,, just to know its 85* & sunny right now is obvious
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game its the best ive played for android i would reccomend this to anyone i know and ii will buy in game money
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I downloaded this as the FAOTD.  I saw a lot of reviews complaining about ads while others said there weren't any so I was curious to find out.  I saw no ads from what I played so far.  I am sure an ad driven app would've definitely put one in.  Maybe people are confused by the comic book style intro pics.<br /><br />Anyways, this game is cute but more for a child.  It's a Robinhood style theme.  This isn't going to teach children to steal.  If parents parented their children then their children would know the difference in games &amp; reality.  Stop blaming EVERYONE/EVERYTHING else when the real problem is America's lack of parenting skills in most homes.  Not all, but most these days.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It's good. You need to know how to work that's not hard. Good luck. It's amazing. One star people are STUPID!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive but it is fun to play and pass time. It will make you mad but I still love playing it. I was so happy that it was available for Kindle Fire
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Outstanding bio by Isaacson who pulls no punches.  Not only great insights into a complex man but a terrific history of Apple computers.

B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|Cloud Atlas includes the stellar acting talents of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon among others. The talented cast is the only area that I could see where Cloud Atlas excells. Despite those talents, Cloud Atlas is one of the most muddled and disjointed video presentations (I refuse to denigrate \\"movies,\\" even including those winners of the dreaded \\"Raspberry\\" awards by referring to this disaster as a \\"movie\\").<br /><br />I strongly urge anyone who is considering purchasing and viewing Cloud Atlas to do themselves a favor: Go wash and clean the toilet. The stench is very similar, and you will ultimately get something useful from the cleaning: A clean toilet. Bonus: You will have a feeling of accomplishing something useful, instead of wishing that you had those wasted 172 minutes back.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This is a great movie......I just love movies about food and cooking and restaurants.This one fufills all those things...Perfect !
B00EYE0ECW|2.0|Whenever I try to use it on my Kindle HD it causes Silk to hang.  I also get blank screens when I try to zoom in.  And in a few instances the Kindle Fire HD 8.9Rebooted.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I love Julia Childs and I met her and Pepin in Boston in 1995. This movie is perfect as I love to cook what they are cooking and have my dinner while watching the movie...It tastes even better !!..LOL
B0073XORLU|3.0|Everything since Crest of Knave has been a disappointment to me. And Crest was simply Tull doing doing pop, IMHO. I'm a life long Tull fan but that DOES NOT mean I'll ever give high ratings to the likes of Dot Com or anything else just because it's Tull and it's new. But this album... Well, I was prepared to hate it. Maybe listen to it a few times and put it with Storm Watch (I don't know why I hate SW, just do) and write it off to Ian needing a quick buck. However...this is an actual straight up Tull album (sorry Martin). Definitely hearkens back to the prog days in complexity and creativity. It won't take a place with TAAB, Aqualung, or SFTW, Minstrel, HH, but, for me, it's solidly with War Child, Stand Up, Benefit, side two from PP. A different sound than those, certainly, but about that level of overall creativity and overall auditory goodness.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited!! I've been waiting for this game to come out for the Kindle Fire. I love this game, each level gets harder and harder. Very challenging.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I wish there were! I would give this one 5 million! Love Stephen KIng, He is better than ever! Danny is exactly the way I thought he would be.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun game to play it is pretty easy but can be addictive. I like to play when I need to relax. I am a bit of a word need anyway.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Based on characters in the movie series. My grandchildren enjoy the games and I enjoy the that they can visit other villages without a Facebook account link.
B006OB3K56|3.0|First the positives, why I gave it 3 stars.  Michael Fassbender is a great actor and is great in this, he's the reason I watched it.  I also like Carey Mulligan but this wasn't one of her best films.  Fassbender plays Brandon, a sex addict.  I think his addiction was portrayed as powerfully as it could have been, which was effective - sex scenes that do nothing but scream how empty he is inside, how badly he lacks the ability to emotionally connect.  Director Steve McQueen does a great job of conveying the characters' emotions and thoughts often without anyone saying a word.  I like that.<br /><br />Now the negatives.  The very slow pace is effective in the beginning, but wore on my patience as the movie progressed.  Too slow for too long.  And by the end of the movie I just wanted to take a shower and watch a really funny comedy.  The movie left me feeling dirty, empty, and depressed.  Sometimes movies do that, and I can handle it, but in this case it ended up being for no reason whatsoever.  In the end the characters are as bad or worse than they were in the beginning.  It's an effective movie, but the effect is very bad.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Both cables , for both kindles we bought, are now peeling apart and no longer charging the kindles.  Extremely frustrating!  I see this is an ongoing issue for many, many other kindle users.  Wishing Kindle /Amazon would recall and replace (free).  Can't seem to find the easy way to contact them and ask for replacement.  Already Apple fans and now leaning FAR more towards iPads and less towards kindle!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I give it three stars because I prefer real literature.  This book is very entertaining though keeps you wanting more.  It's part three of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.  The second book was my favorite; although this book has some twists not as much as the second book. The  story in this book is predictable, but none-the-less happy ending. I skipped some parts at the very end. I don't know why the author felt it was necessary to relive the first book at the end.  I get it but by that time I found myself lossing interest in the book. Entertaining, easy summer read nothing else.
1576875776|5.0|I am really enjoying this book of her work. Large and clear pictures of Vivian's photos. Definitely a good buy.
B00COO2D6O|3.0|Good so far... haven't played very much so yeah.<br />Eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|Many artists at age 70ish  still perform in a stellar fashion.  Paul is the only one I know of who still has the steam to create an entirely new collection of songs.  A new collection of incredible songs and arrangements.  Not a weak cut on the album.  All powerful, beautiful and new.<br />The Beatles sound WAS a collaboration of four men, but it's clear that Paul was a driving force on the creative directions.<br /><br />For me, this IS a Beatle album.  It has all the hallmarks, and why not?  It's Paul.  Thank you Mr. McCartney.  What a special gift to the world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My wife and I were detectives together.  The problem was the game was over in a couple of hours.  But we did have a really good time while it lasted.  Looking forward to additional levels soon!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was so great catching up with Danny &#34;Doc&#34; Torrance. It seems even when you beat the monsters more are waiting down the road.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this app forever!what a great birthday gift!and it is free! thank you amazon!easier to play on my kindle than a phone!
B009WUBERW|5.0|this was a great action movie would recommend to view if interested in action type movies. Acting was very good
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The ads featured Morgan Freeman with a significant presence. In the movie he's a seldom used afterthought. The movie has little to offer. The story could have been rendered better, but whoever is responsible for that decided to bore it down. If you like real boring movies, this is it. Otherwise, it's not worth five bucks and two hours of your time.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The author made a Huge mistake in terms of timing and technology. In writing a piece on Janie, Moriarty wrote that Janie could have e-mailed or sent a text to John-Paul. No such technology was available in 1984. The fact that no one caught this- the author, the proofreaders, the editors bother me.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for iTunes Radio for my Kindle Fire, and this is what I found.  It is essentially the same thing.  It has my favorite radio stations from both the internet and the Real World.  You can find pretty much any genre or style of music and talk radio.  Great app for streaming radio, I highly recommend it.  And it is free!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good graphics & storyline. Frustrating when energy is spent as you have to either wait until energy is replenished or purchase energy. Along with Mystery Manor the kids & I play this every evening!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I believe this to be his best in years. a great sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;. Don't miss it! A must read.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I never read the book, but my daughter did.  It had &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; cheesy-ness with the costumes and a disturbing variation of &#34;The Running Man&#34; using kids.
B00F2362IE|4.0|This is a very fun game but some glitches. First, sometimes when I play wherever I touch appears the pause screen. Next, sometimes when I finish Turtle Time, it brings me to the app store. Please fix this and I will be happy to rate it 5 stars. Otherwise this is a great game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|#GOOD GAME . its a good way to learn how to save money.ICE AGES 1-4 good movies. someone please make a new series or something; like a good movie like blue sky. and can you guys do me a favor a watch Wwe Raw on mondays at 7:00/8:00p. its a cool show RKO.#WWE
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have purchased 3 of these I keep one in the house and one in each backpack.  I've used these on several knives without issue with good results.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is the best Korn album in years! So happy Head is back and their sound is better than ever! I listen to this album from start to finish without skipping tracks, that's how you know its a great album! One song is better than the next. My current favorite is Mass Hysteria. Its been on repeat in my car, in my house and at work since I got it! Cant stop listening to it! This is a must have!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Trying to find matches involving luck but also strategy is fun and relaxing.  Perfect for after a stressful day.  My kids are 7 and 6 and it quickly became too hard for them.  But my husband and I love it!
B00E9PMMX0|4.0|Here we go again. Another re-release of the saga. Not that it's a bad thing. I already own the Blu-ray set of the saga, the dvd versions of the original trilogy with both the SE and original versions. However, I am going to end up purchasing these. George just keep tinkering with the movies, and I love that! My wife says that George Lucas owns me..haha.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|What can I say? The show rocks.  We have all the complete seasons.  Never get bored with them!  Loving their new season now.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Fun and addicting<br /> My kid's and I play all the time I would recommend this to everyone<br />I love it fun and fast paced
B002AGIEYG|5.0|I found and watch his 3rd Symphony on U-tube first. It was the most impressed Horn solo of the Berliner Philharmoniker on the third movement and Conductor Simon Rattle's expressions.<br />Then, I ordered this album and I have been enjoying it.<br />I recommend this album if you like real german expression on the Brahms Symphonies.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I just loved watching the show. Felt it had a great storyline and the talent to carry it off.  Very sad it was cancelled :(
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|About time they put it on kindle!!!!!!  Been waiting. My 4 stars rating is nexus some levels are frustrating and almost impossible with out spending real money. And when u get frustrated u don't enjoy playing. I am level 163
B009XWD02G|1.0|worse app ever does not work on droid phones or kindle fire or tablets don't use at all not a good app for anything on the market
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Basically, a big dumb action movie chock full of superannuated stars from the 80s and 90s, some of whom are aging more gracefully than others, spouting cornball lines while making mincemeat out of their opponents. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005HSL626|4.0|Really like being able to play with my friends and unlock new blades. I first played this at Dave & Busters. It was really lots of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME SO COOL AND AMAZING!!!! (: I really like this game it's so fun get it right now!!!
0316074314|1.0|I have nothing to say about Ms.Catton as a novelist--she may produce something important one day.  But--if one expects from a novel deep observation, analytic perspicacity--in particular regarding the animal condition (our condition as animals in world where the victims of our narcissistic sense of human primacy are our own kin of every species)--then this novel does not deliver.  It does provide, as many have already stated, a fine tapestry of overlapping contexts, but by p. 150, I knew I was drinking something that did not satisfy.<br /><br />So--I admit that I did not complete the reading and have returned the book to my neighbor.  I wish Ms. Catton well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, it's available on Kindle Fire.  I am already addicted.  I only wish you could earn more than 5 lives.
1416955070|5.0|book was in great condition like it said it was and recieved it before expected thank you for this book . i love it
1444777556|5.0|I expected less from the follow up.  Was I ever surprised!  This was a very rewarding read, the excitement and charm of the original story never sagged.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is well deserving of a Pulitzer Prize. Beautifully written while at the same time describing a sad dark country.
1250029465|5.0|When someone is as far down and out as this young man was, but still has left enough humanity and sympathy to aid a helpless creature, it can't be anything but heartwarming and uplifting.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Only gave it a 4 star because, opponents always do there RIP attack at the end. Last, best of all its free!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You is a Wonderful book. Touching and heartwarming and real. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Couldn't stop reading it!
B00E95ED32|5.0|Love most of the songs on this album.  I especially loved Lay Me Down sung  by Adam Lambert co-produced by Nile Rogers.  Producer, Tim Bergling, is unique.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I was concern reading the 1 star reviews saying that there was a hissing issue with this mixer, and let me say that it is true, however it only happens when you crank all the settings to the extreme highest point (on each knob). If you are using headphone to monitor the audio you will never hear this hissing as having as such high volume would probably rupture your eardrums. My reason for the hissing is probably bad quality equipment being used, I'm sure using high-end equipment would probably solve this issue (most likely you won't be using this for super expensive equipment). I would recommend this product for anyone looking to monitor 2/3 sources with great control over your quality of audio.<br /><br />Plus for me: I'm a desktop user and having to reach the back of my tower just to unplug/plug my headphones was a hassle, this solved it as now I have it setup next to my monitors and just quickly unplug/plug my headphones. And I almost forgot to mention how greatly it increased the quality/volume coming out of my desktop.<br /><br />Note: on Windows/MAC you will need to download the appropriate driver from this page<br />[...]<br /><br />For linux it worked out-of-the-box using Ubuntu 13.10 (using ALSA).
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|Actually liked this one better than the second one.  Chow was so funny in this one.  I'm only typing now cuz they force me to have so many words. Dumb!
B004UNX1LS|1.0|this app always messes up when I'm watching videos. I cant get through one video without having to force close the app.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Fast and interesting read.  For the first time in years I wasn't able to determine \\"who done it.\\"  Am looking forward to author's next novel.  Would recommend this book highly.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Addicting game play and keeps you entertained.  WAR PLAY IS OK not bad for a free game.  Coin build up is slow is you don't pay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lovin this game. Glad to get it on my Kindle Fire HD. Been playing on my phone but glad to have it here too.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|After discovering Woodkid through my random internet travels, I must say I was instantly hooked. Every track is moving in its own way. The album is pure brilliance.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun and challenging. Can't get enough. Great brain exercise! Would definitely recommend this app to friends and family!<br /> A+++
B000002MJC|5.0|This is a terrific CD with excellent, moody Depeche Mode music and lyrics tied to Faith and Devotion. Powerful lyrics and powerful music. I highly recommend it for old and new fans!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very shallow...a vicarious romp that appeals to some.  I keep wondering why I was reading this immature babble.  I won't purchase the next book in this saga.
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|It does occupy one for hours, but is too easy and too slow moving to be a real challenge.  After a few minutes of it, my mind was numb. Leave this one for the kids, but they may not like it because it is repetitive and slow.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I think dumb ways die is a really fun game, but its one of those games that if you play it to a while it starts to get boring. I recommended it because its great for past time and its free.:-)
0786939532|5.0|I have only been through half the book so far and it is amazing I love the detail that salvatore puts into his books. Also when I got the book mailed to me it took about 6 days, but when it arrived it had a sticker on the cover that said it was an autographed copy. Sure enough I open it and there it is a R.A. Salvatore signature. Great shape as well. Would definently buy the next drizzt books from this seller.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game its soups awesome u need it i pretty much live in this game buy it know
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|The kids loved this movie and have been quoting movie lines ever since watching it. There is plenty of adult humor to keep the grownups laughing as well. I would strongly recommend this movie to any family.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is very overrated because all you do is just swipe, swipe , it only gives you like 10 swipes to beat a level and the people are just look downright CREEPY.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I've always been into Star Trek, but the last two movies are great in my opinion. The special effects are top of the line with very entertaining story lines, you don't need to be a Trekkie to enjoy this movie. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to watch an exiting fantasy movie with great FX.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|This app is great! It lets you pause things, and everything is saved. Occasionally the pause button won't push, but it doesn't freeze.<br />The app also makes you pay for recording and other things, but it isn't expensive.<br />Overall, great app. I would highly recommend getting this app and the problems aren't annoying. The only good FREE video app.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This is an entertaining movie with decent special effects, definitely worth renting. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a fantasy movie with good action and fx.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|THIS game is bad you only get like 3 min. Do not get this game EVER. I say gun craft is better.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very insightful and interesting. I have learned some things about myself as well as what I would like for my future.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The movie was a traditional butt kicking action film for guys who like movies. The best part is watching for free with amazon prime.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book was breath taking.I was very sad  but then became uplifted in joy. I will always remember this book and recommend you to read it
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This movie had an interesting twist, and for the first movie to surprise me since Psycho. However, this is not a horror film.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Did you ever struggle to reconcile the person who said &#34;love your neighbor as yourself&#34; and &#34;judge not so that you will not be judged?&#34;  with the people who tell you that if you play cards, dance or get a divorce that you will be eternally damned?<br /><br />This book explains how someone named Paul who never met Jesus and was in conflict with the apostles lead by James hijacked the followers of Jesus and created an entirely new religion.<br /><br />It also explains how the bishops who met in Nicea over 300 years after Jesus died selected the books that are in the Bible today and suppressed the others that were written.<br /><br />If you want to read a well researched book about the world Jesus lived in and why the New Testament is the bundle of contradictions buy this book and open your mind.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I generally liked the movie and the special effects were captivating, but something was missing in the plot or editing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing while I am watching TV.  It is so easy to use and fun and challenges me too.
1568363931|5.0|This is a must for using with the stackable lunchbox.  It has loads of good suggestions, and some I'll never use, but is a great starter.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|This is a great family movie. It shows the love between pets and owners.<br />This is a good adventure story with a happy ending. Good triune over ill.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|This was my husband's favorite movie and ended up becoming one of mine as well.  The story is enjoyable even for a first time viewer, but the characters have so much depth that watching this film, many times over, leaves you with big life questions.  I have watched it so many times, but enjoy it greatly still.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Some final seasons are so horrendous in both content and execution that they not only suck, they do retroactive damage to the entire series.<br /><br />This is one of them. Spare yourself.<br /><br />I mean it, if you've made it up through Season 7 just stop there. That's actually a fairly decent ending for the show. If you go through this last season you run the very real risk of destroying the re-watchability of Dexter as a whole.<br /><br />Because this? This transforms the 96 episode run into a complete, comprehensive, catastrophic failure.
1250000971|5.0|I've enjoyed Jeffrey Archer's writings over the years and was glad to see there were three more to read.  I'm now on the third volume of The Clifton Chronicles - first two volumes were page turners.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Norton's break-out role is a brilliant thriller with one hell of a twist.  Get this movie in library.  You will not be disappointed.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Thank you for this series.  It is very nicely made. It is also a great buy and hard to find. While not entirely true to the book, it is what lured my wife and I into the book series as well.  We appreciated it much better this way. (watch movie first, then read books)  That is almost a universal truth anyway.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Weaving a story such as this one that takes the reader back in time and forward into the future is the work of a gifted artist.  I highly recommend this novel to all seriousm  reader
B000JQUZCI|1.0|This is NOT the complete, unabridged version. Upon completion of more than half of the work needed for school, my son learned the reason for his wrong answers stemmed from the misinformation and misalignment of THIS version vs the printed version.  His teacher sat down & compared the versions, to find this ebook greatly differs from the accepted classic version. Be careful if using for a school assignment, but it's not bad for personal enjoyment reading.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|another &#34;I-cannot-put-it-down&#34; win for Gillian Flynn!  I loved GONE GIRL - and SHARP  EDGES isn't GONE GIRL, but it still kept me guessing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this app for so long! But it's finally here. Now let's get to the app. Challenging,fun,addictive, and more! You can also connect with Facebook but don't worry it's not one of those apps that say aft about ten levels &quot;Connect to Facebook to continue.&quot;, you can go on without that happening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very fun and additive game to play. You want to play it very day to keep up.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a very good game. I love it. To build a house and my own city its great. Drive with cars and busses are awesome
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Though I enjoyed the free part of this game I adon't like the free, just kidding garbage game companies pull. Also for whatever reason this game kept telling me it couldn't download for lack of space even<br />though I have boatloads.me
B00F880BWG|5.0|Worse thing you can do in a television series is a cliffhanger. I guess walking dead has nothing else to do but keep people in suspense until next week or next season. Lol
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It is very simple, it teaches you pronunciation (even if it is from a computer-like voice), unlike other programs I have tried.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a cool game.  You don't get many coins at once, but it's alright.  At of all I guess it's good.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I couldn't wait to read and get on to the next book...Very good stories. Didn't want it to end.  I have read a lot of books by this author. All great.
0061673730|3.0|So the picture shown on the order was deceiving, it was not the edition shown on the picture in the order.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|This films lives up to its title. Steel alright. It had no warmth. Just boring, brash and downright forgettable.<br />Please don't waste your time watching this movie. Go watch the Superman 1 and 2 (Richard Donner cut) instead.<br />In a way, I am so glad this movie was not called Superman. Because it was not and had nothing to do with Superman.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally it's for kindle fire! I been waiting a long time my mom plays this I watch her play it's cool!
B007VF1X12|5.0|The music of Hayden, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven dominated the classical music scene for almost 200 years. Their music is one of man's greatest achievements which deserves to be cherished forever. They squeezed every iota of music possible to various structures, such as sonata form, the fugue, et al.<br />Then along came Claude Debussy . . . with new music for 20th century man. His music---I am finding this out by playing MP3 selections downloaded from the Amazon Cloud---is fantastic. Not as structured or formal as his predecessors, nevertheless Debussy's music is equally mezmerizing and sublime.<br />His music has influenced modern-day composers such as jazz gurus Duke Ellington and Bill Evans, and significant others (Ravel, Stravinsky, avant-garde and minimalist composers (Reich & Glass).<br />All that being said, the proof of the pudding is to listen to the music. Let your ears take over. If you listen, you will be amazed.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is actually very enjoyable, and definitely one of my favorite apps. It has some depth in it playing as a sort of epilogue to Iron Man 3. However as you get further into the game it starts to get nearly impossible, to dodge obstacles and actually progress. When you do beat a boss and continue with the story, it only gets more frustrating. The game also seems to lag quite a bit, only adding to the chaos. Despite its flaws, this app still presents itself as a really great choice, especially since it is free.
B000026OHN|5.0|The greatest musical genius of all time? A distinct possibility, tho devotees of Hayden, Mozart, Beethoven and Debussy might quibble. Will we see his like again? Unlikely. So, if you feel that modern man and his music is on an inexorable climb upwards, think again.<br />What to do? That's the easy part. Just download his music from Amazon Cloud, and listen to your heart's content. It's the smartest thing a music-lover can do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome. If you had to choose any game to play I guarantee you that you will pick this one
B008M721MS|5.0|It's amazing to hold a person in your hand as you talk to them across the miles and see them while you talk.  Works seamlessly.  Just best if you keep the Kindle plugged in so you don't lose the connection when the battery runs out.  Or at least be near a plug if your battery gets low.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Great debut album.  I saw Vintage Trouble open for The Who earlier this year at the Honda Center in Anaheim.  They are one of the best warm-up acts I've ever seen!  I liked their live performance so much that I purchased The Bomb Shelter Sessions CD.  This album is rock solid and reminds me a lot of James Brown, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, Humble Pie, and early Led Zeppelin.  I wish more bands would play this kind of music.
0393324818|4.0|This book while it has been dramatized into a movie does remain close to the book.  Written by Michael Lewis the book chronicles the Oakland A's.  Billy Beane has assembled a team that closely resembles his thinking.  As a team without a lot of money he continually is able to reach the playoffs despite being outspent by a ratio of 2-4 times as much.  This book helps bring together economics and baseball to a wide audience.
B00BP0O7QW|1.0|I never got it . I hope it's a good book but it wa suppose to come on the 15 and still haven't gotten it
B00D48BT5A|5.0|History. Boring. Unless told by Bill Bryson. In that case you don't want to stop reading! Five stars well deserved!
0060523808|4.0|informative portrayal of how Louis worked his magic and brought focus and direction back to IBM.  Many good principles and solutions that can be used in anyone's day to day management and leadership in their own life.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I recently purchased the Chromecast module from Amazon. I excitedly opened my box and plugged the module into the hdmi port on my TV. I elected to use my phone to set up the Chromecast device and to my chagrin I was not ever able to connect the module to my wifi. I tried for about an hour (tinkering with my router settings)before venturing online to see if others were having similar problems. Bingo! It does not work with 5 GHz wifi anymore. You have to connect to the device using the 2.4 GHz band. Once I did that everything has been smooth sailing ever since! Originally you could use 5 GHz but so many people were having issues Google updated the modules to auto detect the stability of your 5 GHz band and use only 2.4 GHz - as per Google's help forum.<br /><br />I have Apple TV 3rd generation, PS3, XBox360, and now Chromecast. I will directly compare it to my Apple TV. Without a doubt it is easier to use and I have less issues with my Chromecast than mirroring my laptop with my Apple TV using Mac OS. When mirroring my Chrome browser tabs, it takes less bandwidth than mirroring my entire desktop using Apple TV. I also love that I can stream a selected tab and continue to work in other tabs when using my Chromecast and laptop combo. When I mirror using Apple TV, whatever I am doing on my laptop is mirrored to my TV. One thing I noticed is that when I am mirroring using Apple TV it is hit or miss. Sometimes I can connect and sometimes I can't and have to restart my connection. I have never had a single issue with Chromecast thus far. This issue is most pronounced when using Hulu through a web browser. I can rarely get through an episode while mirroring using my Apple TV without it stuttering to the point of being unwatchable. Sometimes I can use Apple TV and hulu without issue. I check the band channels to make sure they are not cluttered with users so I know it is not that. I want to mention that I have a super high bandwidth router. I have never had an issue mirroringmy tabs with Hulu playing using Chromecast.<br /><br />Where Apple TV one-ups Chromecast is the resolution with which you can mirror. Chromecast is limited to 720P while Apple TV can mirror higher resolutions and is limited by your TV's resolution. Apple also has more apps available on their device.<br /><br />I love that I can easily switch between tabs, apps, and devices using Chromecast. Transitions are seamless.<br /><br />I am about to purchase another Chromecast (love it so much).  $35 dollars... can't beat that  :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I have been waiting fir it to be available on kindle fire hd yes thank you Lord and Appstore
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Best pool app ever simple but can be very tricky to beat your opponent which are real ppl. By the way
B000MD9UJC|3.0|The end cap push button feels loose and cheap.  The threads are poorly machined, not like the awesome quality of the original Maglight end cap. The light produced is OK.  Other than trying to get some re-use out of my venerable Maglight, I'd recommend the 3 CREE LED flashlights for $20 at Costco over this kit.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I can't believe this was so good..<br /><br />I bought the book and the Graphic Novel...<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone..
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This by far was the best third person book I've read yet! Great details and wonderful timing for the climax of this book. Loved it again and again!
B001P7HUF0|5.0|I just wanted to keep reading as the story kept my interest as it moved along. The characters were interesting as they were well developed. The main character's plight was fascinating. I would recommend this to most fiction readers!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|It's not, of course,  the best movie ever made, but it was very well done and darned engrossing (and I'm not a huge fan of the action film genre).  Tom Cruise did a terrific job, and my interest never waned. Bobby Duvall was his usual delightful self.
B0031RS64G|5.0|I absolutely love this series, I am totally absorbed in a different world when i read these books.<br />A word of warning though,  these books are not for the feint hearted, Steven Erikson will not hold your hand for a stroll through a foreign land. He will dump you right in the maelstrom, literally from page one, then it's sink or swim. i recommend swimming because once you find your feet your are in for an incredible experience supported by incredible characters.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series. Great characters, well written, beautiful period pieces, and story lines that are very enjoyable. I have watched it more than once, and will again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I just want to die over it. It is so awesome and I love the new thrall and features this game Is.  Assonance so you Guys should haveistmas tm to.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I was looking forward to playing this game, waiting and waiting for the progress bar to fill up.  Then my Webroot Security &amp; Antivirus Premier popped up saying the App had a Trojan.  Please make sure you have software on your device before downloading any App especially if you sideload your Kindle...
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|So much better than Iron Man 2! This does not disappoint! Edge of your seat action throughout! We will be buying this one for our collection!
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|I miss these guys.I love their old their sound, but this welcomed change does not let me down. It's an appropriate evolution for the band.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Eh..James Franco is a bit &#34;flat&#34;<br /> But the effects were great-storyline held together..Only, we purchased the HD version-and..its not compatible with our Roku-so we have to change audio settings when we want to watch it-lesson learned..
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I first read this book thirty years ago- prepare to experience every known emotion.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in history
0812550757|5.0|I am a huge fan of Orson Scott Card and the Enderverse.  This is one of his best works.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I bought two of these. One for a gift and one for myself. I love watching & listening to Justin Timberlake on this DVD. This is a great gift idea for anyone who loves him!!! It was also shipped extremely fast too!!!
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|ads ads and more ads plus adware make this app a little lesser than the price which is zilch....  clean up your act rovio, as you would be surprised what a good reputation would do for ur sales
B009LDD5HW|1.0|item was sent in a package that was open when i received it.  the blu ray was not included in the package.  I have made multiple attempts to contact amazon.com and have not received any response as of yet.  For someone with my long amazon ordering history, this is very disappointing and discerning set of events.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I've been playing this game on my iTouch for about a year now.  I was really disappointed when I could not get it for my Kindle Fire.  The iTouch is so small to use.  Now that I have it available on my Fire, I hardly ever use my iTouch.  One thing I did notice that is different.  There is no Daily Game on the Amazon version.  It would be nice to have that included.  I also miss the extra five cards to use for 2000 points.  Other than that, I absolutely love it.  I waste too much time playing but I have time on my hands to enjoy doing what I love to do.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I actually watched the show prior to reading any of the books. The show followed the book very well and I learned a few things. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|So visually stunning, memorizing, and funny funny funny--to the core. One of the best films I've seen since Toy Story one, Two, and Three.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|A great old movie, and always worth seeing again.  Wish they would make movies like this now.  It is fun to see again and again.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great start to the new season. Good to see the old faces and some new.  Can't wait for what's to come!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love waking up to du hast by rammstein or any other song I choose. Has all the features of a real alarm clock. The snooze button is  my fave. Works perfectly on my kindle fire.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is the best photo app ever! Tons of stickers and backgrounds and frames and effects and more! You should totally buy it! :)
B00CBKLO52|1.0|I didn't keep this game on my tablet so I don't rate  it good or bad.  I don't have it.  It wasn't for me.<br />thanks. Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay.<br />bj
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This book is so bad that I couldn't finish.  It is like a child's top.  It just keeps spinning and not hoping anywhere. Characters were undeveloped and the setting even less so.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I love games and this is one for the challenge and I like  playing it because you can go up on the aggressiveness of the game. I enjoy it.  okay.<br />bj
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is a literary genius. He'll have you laughing your tail off even while your heart is breaking for the characters. I'll not be giving anything away. Buy the book. I thought it would be too depressing. I thought wrong.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Bought it for the 3d which did not disappoint. This is not the best movie in the world as far as plot goes but it is one of the prettiest. It is a pleasure to look at from start to finish and the characters are fun if not broad archetypes.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Really enjoyed the continuation of cultural art and the angst of youth and life in the modern age.<br />This album is truly a recent classic and a poetic work of audio art. Beyond art as noise this sound scape moves the electronic story forward.<br />Peace & Light
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how they are always adding a new area or idea to this game...it keeps it fun and exciting, and makes me want to come back to explore the new areas. Some games are the same and get kinda boring, and I lose interest in them and stop playing them- BUT not this one!!! Thanks for a free one of a kind game! :)
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Great Movie, lots of physical contact and destruction! The movie is fast paced and keeps the viewer immersed. They make the Jegers look possible as if they could actually exist in the near future. Only one curse word that I can remember throughout the whole movie and that was- oh wait there is at least two... both the B words, I was so into it I didn't pay it any mind. Still not bad considering other movies. The rating is appropriate. One thing to keep in mind, if you have watched movies on Amazon before and you know you have less than a perfect connection you might want to try the HD version. I got the regular and every-time the connection went down to less than 3 the film got pixiled and it was hard to follow some of the action scenes and that is one thing this movie has a lot of. I don't know if that would make it better to follow or not, but its a suggestion. Otherwise, I Loved it! 5 stars!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so much better than the last one it has better graphics more animals better aiming an control an my little girl loves to play it when she can
B00CF2UORK|5.0|All of my children love this show. I wish amazon brought in more seasons! Our entire family enjoys European (especially) British cartoon shows. Thank you for making it available on Prime.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I like having to ability to check the radar any time I want.  Very user friendly and seems always be up to date.  Very handy to have with the quick changes in our midwest weather.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I thought it looked kinda cheesy but when I got to playing I found I really couldn't put it down. The levels are fun and challenging. I have almost all three apples on all levels but I can't get through the last one. Anyhow its a good game give it a look.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Great! And great to have 2 disks incase one gets damaged. My son absolutely loves the movie as well. Thanks so much!
B005UT29Z0|5.0|I was not sure what to expect. Great actors throughout. Good storyline. The pace was good. I like how they took bits of pieces of the big financial companies and played with fantasy too. One of the better free prime instant videos I have seen on Amazon. I recommend watching this if you would enjoy a well-written script about the world of finance. If you did not follow closely to the 2008 sub prime mortgage crisis- it may be helpful to briefly read about it online. Then, one can play the fun game to decipher which moves and pieces may have been their real-life counterparts. I would have enjoyed a more realistic ending. But it was an enjoyable flick.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this product it is the most amazing app ever it is fun chatting with your friends so plzz add it back to the Amazon app store we really want it back
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm obsessed with this game! It's SOOO addictive . All you have to swipe the candy to get 3 or more in a row. I love the feeling when you beat a level you have been stuck on. Get This Game!!
B005HSL626|4.0|This game I really like it keeps me moving got this from my daughter and son recommendation<br />I love the game would not change anything on it<br />If you want  to get your blood moving I recommend this game
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've always loved hidden object games so this one was no disappointment for anyone who enjoys hidden object games as much as me this is a game you will want to check out for yourselves
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|These games are so much fun for me to play.  It is great that the objects are not always the same each time it is played.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is about time man I have been waiting forever. No I tat to play but I hope it doesn't freeze. (please don't freeze) :)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|cheap relaxing fun. i play this game a lot on both my Kindle Fire &amp; my Iphone. love it!<br /> relaxing, soothing music.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I might agree with some reviewers that the peak of the series was the last few episodes of Season 1, but...  leading up to the final episode really worked for me.  Not to mention that the acting was so good I have started watching other shows/movies with these people in them.  Wow!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The game was fun. The graphics are cool. If you don't mind jumping back a lot your gonna like this game.
6305127646|1.0|This was highly disappointing. I'm a big Elisabeth Shue fan and have seen at least four seasons of the TV series with Roger Moore. Kilmer overacted and had  none of the sophistication that I've come to expect from the Saint. Also little of the excitement of the books. I'd pass up this movie and look for the Roger Moore series on Retro TV.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Mr. Hosseini shares his history of a time and place few have talked about, making the characters likeable and understandable. I haven't finished it yet but it is a book I know I will always remember.
B000VX6YCY|5.0|...but this shoe feels great and feels right.  My feet are contoured with each step, I feel like I'm walking on air compared to my Eastlands these are replacing.  I don't even need shoe inserts.  Very well made shoe.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I browsed the device on day-1 but neglected to pull the trigger and lost out on the Netflix deal- I wouldn't be so disappointed if I received the Netflix credit.  Still, at a comparatively $35 price I decided to purchase anyway.  That's the only \\"pro\\".<br /><br />WOW- HALF BAKED DEVICE!<br /><br />I'm an Android fan and have only Android devices in my home.  However, this Android device fails to impress me.  I feel like I'm using an Eclair device again.  Brings back bad memories!  :(<br /><br />WiFi signal strength is horrible, even with the dongle attached.  I have Google Music All Access and the device continually loses connectivity and stops playing.  When I play a Netflix movie, the device takes over the streaming chores but then if I want to pause the video I find that my handheld device has disconnected from the Chromecast.  No way to regain button-control of the Netflix stream.  So, now there's not much reason to use my Chromecast.<br /><br />I am very diappointed Google closed the interface to block 3rd party apps from using the Chromecast.  Let developers be creative!  I'd have many more apps to use with the Streaming media Player if Google would only allow developers to stream media to it.<br /><br />MLB- where is your support?  I've got some TVs that don't have a built-in MLB app.  Chromecast fails to meet my simple needs.<br /><br />Google: make sure the connection between the Chromecast and the streaming device don't lose connection.  You put connections in a state of limbo with no user controls. I can't even use my push-button Harmony remote control at that point other than TURN OFF.<br /><br />Lame device... it's now sitting unused waiting for an update to let me use it to it's potential.<br /><br />Don't buy it... yet.
1939416019|1.0|I've read fan fiction that's better that this drivel.  How does a shepard who has never been outside his mountain village picture hills as camels?  The author is constantly contradicting himself or herself.  In just one scene the king imagines that the threat to his realm is greatest from the outside but goes on to describe how that would be impossible and the real threat is from within the kingdom.  Also, the kingdom has never enjoyed such peace, yet there are constant skirmishes with a neighboring kingdom.  Oh, there it's also some nonsense about a sword that is the source of all power in the kingdom but the \\"Chosen One\\" has not arrived who can wield it.  I only made it a few chapters on before giving up.  I'm so grateful this title was free. Woe be it to the poor soul who tries to make it through this dreck.
B002X6PTH8|4.0|This is SO much fun.  I watch this every once in a while and always enjoy it. It's a happy and utterly unique movie. Jim Carey is one of a kind!
B007X70NVO|5.0|A great inside perspective to the world of Moto GP through the eyes of a legend. Faster gives all of us a unique glimpse into a world few will know and all the intensity necessary to win.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yeah!!! Finally!!! I have been waiting and watching forever for Candy Crush for the Kindle!! This game is super fun and addictive! Easy enough for kids and it links to Facebook.
0007520506|5.0|Amazing mesmerizing book! Well-written and very inspirational! Quick-read!couldn't put it down!  Will need to read other books by this author.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Love it,  I Have all of the Darius Rucker Country music CD's.  It is good to know that he is an African-American, showing the world that African-Americans can strengthen their musical talents beyond, R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Rap.  Another great album.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|Although this version has no big name stars, it was the version my Daughter and rest of Family would watch together each week on PBS. We enjoyed it as great family entertainment.
B00B23O96A|3.0|As a total Eric fan I was looking forward to this release.  There are a few good songs, but the rest is uninspired.  Eric does not need to be doing &#34;old standards&#34; or letting McCartney totally dominate an entire track.  This is not a bad album...but could have been better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is awesome this is a good puzzle game so glad it came out available for kindle fire hd  I used to have to use the computer now o can use it mobile every one should play this game
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This game is a lot more fun than I expected it to be. I can't stop playing and laughing. It's very addicting.
B001RPD06I|5.0|I had to get me another sd card for my galaxy phone.They are good to have extras, thank u very much.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|good, very rich, but several characters somewhat unfinished and unknowable. Alma herself needed more internal life to be a great book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Impossible without help! Had to keep the cheat sheet pulled up the whole time I played. Now have to review to continue.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|The song &#34;1960 What&#34; will grab you and hold you.  He is an awesome vocalist.  I look forward to seeing him and hearing him in March in Pittsburgh, PA.  Come join me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was fantastic! I think everyone should read it!  I give it a five star review! I enjoyed it so much
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Gregory Porter is an awesome vocalist.  From the first time I heard him, live in Pittsburgh, PA, I have been drawn to his music.  &#34;Be Good&#34; is the first CD I purchased.  I heard a song from &#34;Water&#34; - 1960 What and had to have that CD.  Liquid Spirit meets my expectations as well.  He will be in Pittsburgh in March 2014 and I am looking forward to seeing and hearing him then.  Come join me.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|I was generous with a rating of 1.  You can put this one in the same 'stink' category as Battleship.  I think Godzilla vs. Mothra had a better plot line.  I have seen grade school plays with better acting.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This movie brings enjoyment to the young as well as the very old . My whole family enjoys watching the scenes from this movie all the time . We watch this movie when offered about 2/3 Times a week .
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|I typed Despicable Me 2 into our Roku box and paid for it. Despicable Me 1 plays instead. I paid for  Despicable Me 2 not Despicable Me 1. Is there a way I can get a refund?
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Love it more then why other browser I have ever used. It is easier to navigate then silk when it comes to using a browser in my kindle
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app!  Cleaned my kindle and freed up a lot of space.  Great free app that lets you take control of your kindle.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I don't use the social aspect of it, but I enjoy the advance warnings about traffic issues and law enforcement.
B00003CXCT|5.0|My children are in love with Star Wars, and now my grandkids have discovered Star Wars.  The legend lives on.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is the best book in the Grisham series, ALL of which I have read (even his dull obscure ones like The Painted House).  The movie was pretty good, too.  But of course the book was better.  Read it for yourself and see.
B00407PNY2|5.0|What wasn't cool about McQueen?  He was the and remains<br />the man and this film is Steve at his best, playing a role he<br />resisted playing for a long time.  It's hard to see how he could<br />have done it better. No one else could have come close.  The<br />car chase is terrific but it's McQueen's movie and his subdued,<br />coiled-spring performance makes it watchable over and over<br />again.  Old movie?  Like hell, it's a classic of the genre.
B008B68IUY|5.0|my seven yearld nicece loved this car for her monster high dolls she had a great smile on her face when she unwrapped the gift
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a book everyone must read. The research behind it is excellent. Frankly, we have all been rather stupid to think that the problem of atomic war has vanished. We have been very very lucky that an accident with an atomic weapon has not led to something much worse. How likely is it that this will remain the case? It would seem like a good time to sit down and rethink our relationship with these weapons, especially at this moment when there is so little money about to pay for them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you!!!  Love this app.  So glad you made it available for kindle.  Now time for Pet Rescue.  Love my kindle fire and Amazon.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really enjoying all the different layouts, I always enjoy playing this game.  Easy to read all the tiles, not too small like other versions.
0061950726|4.0|Loved the book.  Well written and very historical.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought it to be non-fiction.  I had NEVER heard about the actual &#34;Orphan Train&#34;, and after talking to the book club members and others.........no-one else had heard or read about the train either.  So an interesting tale and learning experience all in one.  Made for an excellent book discussion.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Goes well with Rod's name. Camera work could have been better, but I love his music so the camera work can be overlooked
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I did not like this movie at all. I thought the movie never got going. The only reason I watched this movie was because of Robert pattinson. It was slow the whole movie.
B004J713JW|4.0|Good stuff, like I imagined it to be. I liked the camera work and Billy's agility at this age is really exciting
B004JMY312|5.0|This is a great family movie. I would say that any child 3 up would enjoy. My 10 year old enjoyed.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Has a very spirited cast of characters that are very strong in their views. Each episode leaves you with a kind of moral of the story. It is well written and the cast is very genuine. Great show to watch.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Its a fantastic album! Nothing like old panic!, but hey they grew up and as musicians they have the right to grow up & evolve into better musicians. no? Im happy to hear that they are turning into fantastic musicians/entertainers. Love listening to them! they never dissapoint. same panic!,but with a whole new sound. Whether you going out with friends,staying in,talking a shower,or in your car;its a great album to listen to.=D &#60;3 &#60;3&#60;3
B007SGM084|4.0|The book was great.  Having all three in the bundle was difficult to move around in the kindle.  If I want to go to chapter 20 in book 1, it would take me to chapter 20 in book 3.  Other than that it was great.
0312117337|5.0|It took over 3 weeks for me to receive my Osho Zen Tarot deck, which I paid $73 on a deck worth $25. Not only was the deck ridiculously over priced, but the shipping took forever and the display box in which it came was completely banged up. Fortunately, the cards and book were fine. Awful awful shipping packaging. And though I will not be ordering from this seller ever again, I am truly grateful to have this beautiful deck of cards. I thought they would never come. The imagery on these cards is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I do tarot readings on myself and others and nearly cry because the images are so spot on and beautiful, so inspiring. Get these cards while you can because they aren't available in stores anymore. You won't regret it.
0670026638|5.0|The novel was all about living in the now [in the Zen sense of the word.] The construct of the book was exceptionally interesting: a young girl in Japan writes a diary (there) and it gets washed up on Canadian shore by a middle-aged Canadian-Asian woman who reads it with great interest (here). Each woman is experiencing psychological paralysis over situational issues in her life. Oddly enough, they help each other. And the young girl's great-grandmother is a 104-year-old Buddhist nun [with bald head and frail-thin body] who teaches her grand-daughter, Nao (pun!) how to stand up to bullying by bullying a wave. A great scene. The novel shows the reader how to meditate, how to see the world through quantum mechanics' parallel universes, and explores the underbelly of abuse. I admire the author. The story was outstanding and the philosophical underpinnings fascinating.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton did a fabulous job!  A terrific mystery.............kept me turning the pages.  I loved the way she wove the three times and gave us tidbits of information, but never enough to not finish reading
B005SEZUJE|5.0|Love whedons work. Firefly was great to. Definitely worth watching. You will never know what to expect, yet it all ties together.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great film to watch with family.<br />A true adventure worthy of a night on the couch with a bowl of popcorn.<br />Great movie to tie in all the Super Heroes.
144235948X|4.0|it was a little drug on..I did like it and think it was fun but kinda felt like going in circles but hey I guess real lif relationships are sometimes like that too. Overall pretty good book
0345803507|4.0|Product and price was great. Arrive on time nicely packaged and in excellent condition. This one was missing. I am now happy to have the set complete.
159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is an interesting, dual narrative between a young lady, who struggles with high school rumours and her male counterpart, who is too afraid of what others think. The book captures human attention from the beginning as the reader anxiously awaits the arrival of Clay Jensen and his unique role in Hannah Baker's mysterious, solitary life. This New York Times and international bestseller is overflowing with brilliance as it holds the reader in suspense, while feeding the addictive nature of the reading beast.<br />If anyone is interested in a simple, yet cryptic novel to fill their reading needs, then Thirteen Reasons Why is just what you're looking for.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun fun fun game.<br />Kind a hard to find things but love it... Graphics are good.<br />Happy happy happy. Lol<br />I totally rec c omens this game to everyone. Download it now.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|A very fun read, lacks depth and all of his characters are identical to any other book but it was still fun.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game is a lot of fun and the armors are pretty sweet. I keep getting frustrated because it freezes up on me,  but I think that's an issue with my device and not the app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent show. It gives one a feel for another whole way of life. My wife and I cannot wait for season four to begin.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This was a very good documentary. Anyone who is interested in the history of rock and roll should see it.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I am glad that this was free because it would not install I don't get it I deleted all of my apps but it said sooty not enough space to install those better get fixed or I will not buy any of this company's apps.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|I was expecting a traditional zombie movie, but that is not the case with WWZ. Brad Pitt's role was hard to understand at first and it continued to a little confusing until about three quarters into the movie. The story line was good about figuring out the zombies will not attack sick people, but there should have been some gore.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app really do what it suppose to do, I trust this app! Its my to go tool. Can't think of any other app I want to use but this one.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Makes one wonder what dos go on in this world we live in. Some of it probably closer to the truth than we might think.<br /><br />Forsyth at his finest.  Good!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Game two is as much fun as the first just keeps betting better and this one  has more challenges  keep them coming nd more fun love the<br />Games
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author and he did not fail to impress. Fun, perverted, creepy and deep. What more could you ask for?
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I was hooked from the very beginning. I am Pilgrim is a fast-paced and clever novel, very well-written and with a central character who, although he has done a lot of bad things, is a 'hero' you just have to love.  I would probably prefer to give this 4.5 stars, only because at times I felt it was a bit far-fetched - but with this book, who cares. I was sorry to finish it -  can't wait for the next instalment!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This film should have remained a book.  Far to many details which do not translate well on film.  It was confusing and boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game s the bomb. Especially with friends. I always recommend this game to any one with an ipod or kindle
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My dragonvale recently got an unrecoverable error and I have 1 blue moon 4 moon 3 Sun's 1 gold 1 seasonal 4 bone 2ghost don't want to loose
B0006SSOHM|3.0|Well I have to say that jigsaw is one of the most intriguing criminals I've seen.  Not the most ruthless but the most intriguing.  The only thing that turned me off to this movie was the SLOW pace and the ending.  I won't get into the ending but just beware the majority of the movie and all of the other saw movies are just GORE!  As compared to like a scream film or something this was just \\"How much blood and torture can we get away with\\"  I still think it is worth watching more than once but loosed entertainment value (IN MY EYES) as you watch it more and more.  But like I have said before to each his own.  I think it is one of those movies you will ever love or hate.  I hope you enjoy my comment and comment on my status :)  Have a good time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Why did it take so long to get a kindle app...  fun game. Is very very addictive. Why do I need to leave a comment to rate any games?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I could play uno for hours. I use to play uno with my sister's when we were younger. Now I can play it by myself all the time.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Sometimes it is cathartic to read of others struggling and the beautiful descriptions of the world around the PCT and the people who hiked it.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This was a very wonder concept piece.  Once it starts and the idea of two worlds being separated by opposite gravitational direction is very fascinating.  It is the kind of movie that twerked my brain and left me wondering it this is really possible.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game but it's definitly interfering with my life.  I stop working for a coffee break and decide to play a quick game...two hours later...my coffee is too cold to drink and no work got done'  Love this game...in fact,  I've loved every ITree game I've tried!
1451648545|5.0|what an unbelievable person he was! A genius so close to insanity. the world has changed due to his efforts and craziness. A great and interesting read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game . I beat my brother and I thought I couldn't but I got 2 times more than his score .[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazingly fun for all ages :) my nephew and I play it all the time :) thank you for the game :)
B009LQKHIO|3.0|The story line was okay but the grammar and punctuation definitely need improvement.<br />I am glad it was free; I would be upset to spend money on a book with grammatical errors such as these, which most word processing programs can help repair.
B003U69IX6|5.0|I am so glad I rented this movie, now I know it is one I must buy so I can watch it as many times as I like.  Boy howdy! I did like this movie.  I am looking forward to the next PJ movie.  It was fun and a great twist on the human offspring of the &#34;gods.&#34;
B0055D3EFU|1.0|1. Lame 2. Poorly written 3. Cheesy ghosts & demons 4. Boring 5. Waste of time 6. Poorly directed 7. Crummy special effects
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really a way to tune the world out when I need to. It can be addictive but very fun.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a very nice game challenging but dammm it some of the stages are to hard come on its not that serious it's a game  and y'all Gonna take the fun out of it by it being  sooo hard
B00506NRBS|3.0|Down to earth guy, great ideas won't help you get rich but being honest you need to figure it out yourself without a gimmick
B00383ZTXO|5.0|One of the first bands I ever saw was the Stooges.  In Detroit.  They turned suck into masterwork.  Just that simple.  My life changed.<br /><br />I don't think that this recording is so much an album as it is a kind of hieroglyph, written by men of caves, on a wall we return to all the time with wonder.<br /><br />Everyone else reviewing gets the specifics.  Praise be, because the reviews are highly intelligent.  But I will appeal to the general.  It's cave wall art.  A fire burns behind the painter, and the smell of fresh kill is everywhere.  The clan fears for what's out in the dark.<br /><br />That's my take, and I think Iggy would likely approve this message.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book did what I hope for when I begin any new book, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters during the read and even well after.  JoJo Moyes has become my new favorite author and it's been a long time since I could say that about anybody.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series.  I can't wait to see what happens in season four.  Surprises are always occurring in this show.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse itself is as powerful as gaming mouse twice the price. Of course, the mouse feels as cheap as it actually is. The interchangeable weights are useful, but it still feels a bit light. The buttons are also a bit loose. For beginners though, the mouse is definitely worth it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  Kept me entertained for hours. Has good  graphics. Was pretty easy to figure out what to do next. My son loves to play it  with me. Would like to upgrade this game.
B00000DRXW|4.0|A really bad moment on track 2 stole the show, literally.  For the most part the audience is into it, but the audience cheers the loudest during the most simple part of the cd, a mere 12 bar blues without any solo.  If I could merely edit out that part, then this album would rate a 6 out 5 possible stars.  Really though, this album doesn't have enough tracks on it to keep something on track 2 that only a loser would like.<br />That makes me think two things about this album.  The first is that, maybe this audience was so trashed and drunk that they couldn't tell what parts of the music were good.  The second is that, maybe this audience is completely tone deaf like most Americans are.  America is terrible at educating most of its high school students in the arts.  The result is that people act like parrots, such that when someone from the Baby Boomer generation with credentials recommends something they listen, but the problem is that they don't appreciate it.  Most of America even at the college level doesn't know the difference between major and minor, and that is pathetic.  Take it from me.  I stopped listening to popular music in 8th grade in favor of stuff that usually took more skill to play, though I do admit listening to Nirvana in 8th grade.<br />Other than that, this Saturday Night in San Francisco is magnificent.  It is a rare moment in history: A summit of the best known flamenco guitarists that may very well have been the best in the world when this album was cut.  These days often times it doesn't matter how good you are.  You could be unknown and the best guitar player in the world at the same time.  I know of no other album that blends the skills of guitar in this style as well as this one.<br />Audience aside, it is a true gem, but it is a gem with a giant blemish.  Imagine a huge diamond that at its center has a colossal malformation.  That malformation is the audience cheering its loudest on the entire cd for the part that is the worst, and most contrived deformity, and should be thought of as an embarrassment to musicians everywhere.<br />The best track on this album is track 3.  I haven't heard the song elsewhere, and so it is extra special in comparison to the other songs which if I recall correctly I was already well familiar with them before this live disc.ontrived deformity, and should be thought of as an embarrassment to musicians everywhere.<br />The best track on this album is track 3.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this first season. Chris Noth was a good choice as the &#34;maybe&#34; sleazy former States Attorney. It is well worth watching.
0451232852|1.0|For me, No.<br /><br />I am a lover of historical fiction, a la Michener and Rutherfurd, and so was excited when Ken Follet tossed his hat in the genre ring.  What a disappointment!  My biggest complaints with the book are:<br /><br />1.  Boring!  After the first few pages, it reads like a cheap history text.  Every character seems mesmerized by history and politics - that's all they ever talk about!  Over dinner, while fighting, while working, and even before, during, and after sex!  No real person would ever talk the way these characters talk - they would be scorned out of the room.<br /><br />2.  Cliched!  Think of your most predictable far-left comic book of history, add a few fictional characters, and presto!  Every Lord or Lady, whether English, Russian, or German, is petty, conniving, ruthless, and uncaring.  Every working class member, from the maids to the coal miners to the factory workers were attempted to be written as interesting, likeable, honest, and noble.  Bolsheviks = good.  Capitalists = bad.  Priests = rapists.  Nobility = spoiled.<br /><br />3.  No Plot!  Follet has a great writing style and the books of his that I have read before this were page-turners.  But, while the actual writing of this was good, the plot was non-existent.  No climax or resolution apart from the well-known historical timeline.  No character arch, nothing learned, nothing improved.  And at the end, when you were waiting for your favorite people to get their just rewards, and the bad guys to get their comeuppance, pfffft.  I have rarely felt so disappointed upon finishing a book in my life.<br /><br />In summary, if you are a liberal history textbook junkie who is bored on a friday night, this might be for you.  If you are looking for well thought-out, entertaining, fresh historical fiction, don't waste your time.
0525953728|4.0|I decided to read Mark Owen's NO EASY DAY after finishing Lea Carpenter's wonderful novel ELEVEN DAYS about a fictional Navy SEAL so I'm certainly a Johnny-come-lately to  this best-selling autobiography written with Kevin Maurer, a journalist who, according to the jacket blurb,  has been embedded with the special Forces in Afghanistan six times and who I suppose should get major credit for the fine quality of  the writing in  the book. As the whole world found out (think Fox News) just days after the publication of this searing and controversial book in September of 2012, the author's real name is Matt Bissonnette  who had chosen the name \\"Mark Owen\\" so that his identity would remain hidden. And we have since learned from an interview with the journalist Mark Bowden whose book THE FINISH about much of the same material that he had hoped to interview Bissonnette for his book and that he had given him the proposed date of publication of his  own book when asked by Bissonnettee who then rushed to get his own story published  first. And he used  the name \\"Mark Owen\\" that is terribly close to \\"Mark Bowden,\\" an act that Bowden found \\"a little cheesy,\\" a sentiment I would agree with. On the other hand, he surely is a gentleman as Bowden has said that he hoped  Owen/Bissonnette sells a million copies and he considers him an American hero. (I would agree with that observation also.)<br /><br />The last half of this book-- that you literally cannot put down-- covers  the planning and carrying out of the killing of Osama bin Laden (known by the code name UBL) by the U. S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (Seal Team Six). Whatever your political persuasion, whether Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, whether you like or hate President Obama- unless you are a total pacifist-- you have to acknowledge that these brave 28 men, along with an interpreter and a combat dog named Cairo-- pulled off an amazing and daring mission that trumps any fictional account of any armed conflict you will read. Owen who was one of the first SEALs to get to the third floor of the compound where Bin Laden was and took numerous photos of his dead body is remarkably understated in his account  of what he (one of the team leaders) and the other men accomplished. He maintains that except for the man they took out-- probably the most hunted man in history-- that this mission was not unlike the many others he had participated in, just another day's work by a team of highly trained professional soldiers.<br /><br />Owen says he wrote this book to set the record straight after Washington and  the media got stories out that were inaccurate. A registered Republican, he says \\"none of us were fans of Obama\\" and describes  Vice President Biden whom he met along with President Obama, as telling weak jokes and acting like \\"someone's drunken uncle at Christmas dinner.\\" President Obama,  he alleges, would take credit for the successful  mission and would run with it in a re-election campaign. He fails to acknowledge, however, that if the mission had not been accomplished, that the blame would have been squarely on the shoulders of President Obama,  a glaring omission  it seems to me, since he remembers that because of  a  similar failed attempt to rescue the Iranian hostages  that President Carter ordered, that he probably lost his bid for re-election.<br /><br /> Owen also says in the introduction that nothing he writes about is classified information and that a Special Operations attorney reviewed the manuscript to make sure  that it does not mention forbidden topics and does not \\"compromise or harm the United States.\\". I take him at his word on that. He also maintains that he and  the other men involved are not superheroes. (I would disagree with that statement.)<br /><br /> Most of the money  make from sales of this book will go to honor  the SEALs who have died since September 11. Owen lists 74 names of these men who have died at the end of this extremely well-written book.y well-written book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Super hunting game with outstanding graphics.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes shooting games.  At least this gives you the chance to earn money needed to move forward without a wait.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Must read! If you like the movie, you'll love the books as well. If you have read the book but haven't seen the movie you must watch the movie, they do a great job following the book!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game It is one of my favorite game but what would make this game better is a build your own suit creator that would make this game a whole lot more fun.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|The best use of 90 minutes in film I've ever seen. The best kind of S.F. - you can't tell if it's fiction. This film is so astonishing in scope and clarity that it will leave viewers stunned for 90 minutes. Curiously, I have no desire to see it a second time. Superb acting. Clooney never better. Heart-stopping suspense. The dream sequence is chilling, up there with \\"The Shining\\" quality of chills.
B0026S1XD2|4.0|After all the years that have passed, this music is timeless.<br />Mike Oldfield was ahead of his time, and so yound and talented
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is a good read for anyone who believes that the choices you make or don't make can and will shape your life.  It also looks at marriage and real life struggles that surface through<br />out a marriage.  Well written and thought provoking from beginning to end!
B008EL25LE|5.0|I love this game. The story is nice, but the game doesn't really need one I guess. Except for the 'hidden treasure' puzzles (find the part they show in te picture) there's no connection between the game and the story. But as the story continues the puzzles get harder and harder. Especially the puzzles with the bugs get really hard. But it's addicting. And that's why I have the warning as title. If you start right before you go to sleep, you'll find that the 10 minutes you wanted to play became an hour or even two. You might know the feeling: 'I'll play just one more level' or 'This is really, really the last one.'  If you are not familiar with this feeling, you'll learn it with this game.<br />The only negative point is the 'hidden treasure' puzzles. I play on a 4.5 inch screen (smartphone) and the object are hard to see. But on the otherhand: even if you find nothing or only a few things you'll still continue to the other puzzles. They're not that important. And that's why I don't lower the score.
B0017VG69U|5.0|It is fantastic how this remastering can clean up the original prints and bring the audio up to today's standards without detriment to the original material!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Got it for my sister as a gift she loved it and I got into the show watching it with her. It came in-tacked and on time.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Absolutely loved every word in this book. Read in a day because I couldn't put it down! Wish it was longer.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|My wife like the movie very much & the 3D was done very well.<br />This movie was a lot better than the one in the '70's.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun for kids and adults! Little tip...get enough coins to buy the moon, cuz it's easy to accumulate lots of coins on the moon to buy more vehicles and trick them out.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Just works like a calculator should. History feature is great and percentage info is awesome. No permissions needed is also a bonus.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|Story about a young girl growing up in an adverse situation. Well written with better than average pacing. I couldn't put it down.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|My first 30 second listen to Lorde made me think I really don't need another album. But after liking a third song on the radio (Tennis Court, Royals, & Team), I decided to purchase it. I can't stop listening to it now. The 30 second listen of each song didn't do it justice.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Use it every morning as my alarm clock after I stopped using my traditional clock. It's been perfect so far.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent movie !<br />If u are a super hero movie person, then this is ur movie.<br />Awesome 3D, & an excellent story.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is the best. I have all the seasons on my computer and I can't grt enough!!! Well worth watching
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been searching for Candy Crush for a few months, but all I found were fake games for the Kindle Fire.  I found this two days ago and was glad it's finally on Amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's beyond great it has blocks and blocks and blocks. Sorry so it's really good but don't get it search for blocklauncher it's a free one where you can change your skin and other stuff. Or of you have get block launcher pro
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The only thing I don't like about this show is it's only on once a week. I would watch this show 7 days a week.
B000G6R7B8|2.0|The watch has a mechanical winder which rotates as you wear the watch.  However, the watch only seems to run for about a day without being worn. If, like me, you have several watches, when you come back to this one not having worn it for a day or so, you find the watch has stopped and has to be re-set.  That is annoying.  I have had other auto-winding watches, and they all lasted longer than that.  Also, the canvas strap is very uncomfortable, it is a little stiff and chafes.  I hope that will resolve itself as I use the watch more. if it a more expensive watch I would return it, but I have thrown the box away and I can't be bothered to find another one.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Very good 3D effects, but the story on how a very nice witch turned into the evil witch was very lame.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for having this game on the kindle fire!!! (Now I don't have to play it on my laptop or my smart phone or bug my b /f to get off the laptop)  Very happy customer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the best game ever created love it so munch great for kids best for little kids and very ecdacasonl once more I lave it
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|The last few games I have bought have had issues, so it was really nice to have a game that worked all the way through! It was a fun game, the mini games were interesting. The only nagging problem was where the back button was and how often you had to tap it. But that was minor.
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|Really cheesy and campy. Not worthy of the Marvel name...yet I can't stop watching. It's like watching a car accident.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|I missed this movie in the theaters and was very excited to see it.  I thought I was in for a good heist movie.  What was delivered was a horrible, awful, terrible, crappy movie with so many holes that the entire movie falls through and crashes.  Not little holes but rather HUGE, GIGANTIC, CUJO sized holes...Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />I started writing a long review of the flaws of this movie and I just stopped myself.  Getting my irritation off my chest won't help.<br /><br />Magic is not real.  But sometimes it is in this movie (flying capes and floating magic cards).<br />Hypnosis is not real.  But for this movie it is and we can make people fly across the world and tell us their bank info and go to some magic show by just walking by them and whispering.  Ahhh it pains me to even write the crap this movie pulled.<br /><br />The second heist goes on to tell us that they invited 1000's of people to a magic show who all got screwed and knew they would come so they could pull their robin hood act.  Come on.<br />And why once the ending is revealed does the agent say \\"freeze\\" when he is in on it.<br /><br />Car chase, how could they plan for that chase.  How did they know the agent would have a car to follow them.  And then their switch where they endangered peoples lives.  And does Woody just get to jump on a bus route and drive with a car attached to the front with a dead body in it and nobody on the bus questions this?  Really?<br />And again if the agent is in on it all, why would he climb into the car that was going to obviously blow up risking it all for the stupid third act that could have been done in any way.  And why did they risk the apartment fight and lead the cops there.  He knew his plan was to look incompetent.  Why lead them there and chance anything or anyone getting shot or killed and blowing the entire thing.  Why.<br /><br />The third trick was CRAP.  Hey thousands of people show up and watch us jump off a roof and turn to money.  Oh wait fake money.<br /><br />And then the morgan freeman scene in the cell...poof I'm now outside the cell without a sound. In a second.  Oh cuz magic is real.  Oh wait it's not cuz your entire show was all lies and illusions.<br /><br />Like the stupid Mirror and Common playing air violin.  Who programmed him and why btw.<br /><br />And then magic is real again as the 4 horseman cards fly in the air.  And then they get to be in the eye and go to an amusement ride.  Yippee.<br /><br />It's a movie, I know just let it go.  Like I pointed out earlier, It wanted to be an Oceans movie pretending to be deep like Chris Nolan film.  But it didn't have good characters.  The banter was bad.  The premise was worse.  The story was a joke.  So I'm sorry, I cannot look past it.  This was a bad movie.<br /><br />Don't look too close or you will miss it.  I think I looked to close.  Cuz I missed a good movie like the 5 star junkies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never played Candy Crush before so I figure I'd check it out to see if it lives up to the hype, It does. It's just real fun and simple to play. Encourages players to use social networking to earn power ups but it's not forced on you. Again, It's just really fun to play and I'd recommend it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great show, just gets better and better every season!  Kurt Sutter is awesome!  The cinematography of the shots in Ireland is beautiful!   The show continued to get better and better with every passing season as well!   Please do yourself a favor and watch this show, every episode, every season!   It will not let you down!   So much pain, violence, death and corruption!  I love this show!  Great show, great ending and GREAT cast!
6305428050|5.0|this is a cute movie for all ages.  adventurous and funny this movies has a great plot and makes a lot of sense
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing plot and content! Recommended to anyone! A dance with dragons is a fantastic novel worth reading! Beginning is a bit slow but the end is worth the wait!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally bringing this to the kindle, has played great so far, very addictive , now if only you would do Farm Saga for Kindle
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Started of easy then got harder. I have a few games on my kindle that can keep me captivated and this one has now become my favourite
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|Not a bad app, Certainly worth checking out, but it needs a lot of work. Here are a few things that the developers really need to address.<br /><br />1. More robots - 24 seems a little short and I think to really make a compelling fighting game, They need to have 32 or more to play as.<br /><br />2. Larger campaign - 5 robots a stage is rather short, Again this goes to the number of robots in the game. Adding more robots = More stages/More robots per stage.<br /><br />3. Tone down difficulty/Make it easier to earn coins - Opponents are not that hard in campaign but the bosses can be frustratingly difficult. Only way to beat them is by upgrading and only way to upgrade is buy either spending real money on in-game purchases or by spending hours grinding out. I think if they offer more ways to earn coins, It'd make things a lot easier to deal with and it'd make the game very less tedious and boring to play.<br /><br />4. Fix the multiplayer - Local Wi-Fi multiplayer only is garbage. It sucks that you can play others globally, Especially when even the most basic apps offer that. I really don't know why they did this or why they thought it was a good idea. Either way, They need to scrap it and add a better multiplayer that actually lets you play against other people on a global scale.<br /><br />5. Add free robots - Want better robots? You have to pay. That's actually pretty annoying. Offer more free robots, Actually give people a taste you know and use that to influence them to buy more.<br /><br />Fix those things, even just one or two of them, and they will have a far better game than what they have now. Yes it is worth checking out because it honestly is not that bad but it still needs a lot of work.
1401322786|5.0|This book came quickly and was packaged well. It came in the time promised.<br />This was a diferent kind of book, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.<br />Mitch Albom is one of my favorite authors!
0767802624|5.0|great for all ages this movie has everything- aliens, comedy, action and a great cast.  One of my favorites along with the others in the series
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think it is the best game ever I play it all the time it is a great game!!! There is like different. dragons and levels I think every one should have it. If you do not have this game you should get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I must have been one of only a handful of people that hadn't followed Downton Abbey - until now.  Now I'm hooked!!  What a wonderful series!  I won't miss an episode now for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Beast!!lol I love it I thought it would be just an app but its not I love it. BYE APP NOW!!!!!!!!! I GIVE IT AN A+++++++++-+
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Got it as the free app for the day and love playing it. It's fun going through each stage, figuring out the puzzle, and figuring out how to get all the collectibles. That being said, I think 3 dollars is a bit too pricey. I think 2 is a far better price for this game. Still, Worth checking out (there is a demo/lite version) and I'd recommend it.
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Awesome movie never seen the original. Never really plan on seeing it since I already saw it in a newer version and its basically the same concept just better. Great movie I love chloe as carrie.
B002VECMAE|5.0|this movie reminds me of my dad and how he said things were like for him in Vietnam.  Hilarious movie with quirky comedy.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I found this version of Total Recall closer to the original story.  While both versions are highly entertaining, it is the smaller details that like in this version.  The phone-in-hand and the video on glass for example.  Acting of course was superb with the cast that was brought in and the effects were excellent, but not overpowering.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This work out kicks my butt! I can only do beginner level and I am shredded. lol This is excellent!
B004YAS9M8|5.0|Ok, let me clarify. Ludovico is not Bach nor Mozart, Hetfield or even Page. But that for which he lacks he makes up for, I think in engaging quiet restful music that helps to clear fog of the day. Yeah with a little help from Jimmy Beam! I play this music A Lot during the drive home from work to deal with the brain dead knuckleheads I'm trying to dodge. Ok, that comment was meant to get you to shake your head in agreement. YOU KNOW I'm right!<br /><br />Thank you Ludovico!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It has more twists and turns to integrate the characters. I really enjoyed the entire book from start to finish. Looking forward to reading more of her books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I discovered how handy kindle fire is for everything.  which lead to discovery of need for a calculator. went to kindle app store and found this handy dandy free calculator... it works and the keys are big making it even easier to use. yay!
B00005421R|5.0|a classic sci fi movie.  set in the future with Jane Fonda its racy and interesting and a classic.  super sexual at times.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The writing and acting were much better the second time around.The characters were much better defined and more believable. Can't wait for season 3.
0307236722|5.0|This is the most recent addition to my growing collection of books by Martha Stewart - I now own 5 of her books.  While I am yet to try her recipes from this baking handbook, given my experience with her other books I know that I can expect success with recipes from this book as well. I find her easy to follow instructions, many tips and techniques are essential in sharpening my cooking and baking skills.  Thank you, Martha.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing on my kindle. It's so much easier to play on, instead of having to sit in front of a desk top. I like playing in between book's.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most awesome game I have ever played! It costs money but it's a good deal!  I highly recommend this game to every kid!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is very inspiring I would recommend it any day. It is heartwarming and sweet. It has a great concept it is great how everything works out. It perfect for a 11 or 10 year old. This book has elements of happiness and sadness. The book makes you feel as if you are August (the main character, a deformed little boy).
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|true to the times with the costumes and cultures this movie is an amazing example of how things were and how they changed.  Beautifully written and acted.

B005MLOKXA|3.0|n spite of some &#34;in the weeds&#34; legal procedures that are not so easily followed by the viewer, the characters are well defined and played  with skill. You're able to understand how devious the legal profession actually is (In my opinion) .
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Love Cher had to add this cd to my collection.. love her music she is my favorite .. have been to several of her concerts thank you
0765325950|1.0|Easily the worst book in the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, \\"A Memory of Light\\" is an incoherent mess. Many threads from the previous 13 books in the series remain unresolved at the conclusion of this final volume, leaving readers to wonder what happened. Wonder who killed Vandene Sedai way back in Book Six? You're not going to find out in this book. Ever wonder what the Dark One's super-secret evil master plan was? You won't be able to figure out what it was from reading this book.<br /><br />The previous book in this series managed to close a few long-open threads, revealing several secrets, killing off a few adversaries and closing a few ancient unresolved plots. This book doesn't answer anything. It's just long-winded and poorly written. It feels patched together... which, I guess it was.<br /><br />Parts of the book are unintentionally hilarious. I'm thinking specifically of the chapter in the pavilion where Rand and company have an argument in front of dozens of leaders, and none of the leaders even notice the argument. Terrible writing.<br /><br />Several hundred pages of this book could easily have been culled, and improved the quality of this book (but I think that's true of the last ten volumes). Ultimately, this last volume is a huge disappointment. The first few books in this series were really well-written, but the series turned into a mind-numbing chore, and the final volume has no real pay-off.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|I avoided watching this series for the first few years because I mistakenly thought it dealt with drug use in a trivial way.  However, once I gave it a chance I appreciated it more and more and now recommend it highly.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Awesome movie- I got this for my mom and we watch it all the time.  Its a great family movie based on the smurfs cartoon
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This is a good movie for kids and adults both. There is a few gun fire scenes but not to bad.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The lettering for which USB jack is for Android and which is for Apple is tiny, but this is a handy little device to keep in the glove compartment when you need to charge a device while driving.  It might also make sense to get the appropriate USB cable as well.
B009GESJH2|5.0|love kid rock recently went to his concert here  in washington ... i was surprised how great he really is... thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|perf I really love this app. so cute so fun makes me wanna own a minion... :o that rhymes. I got nothing else
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Stay with this surprisingly funny comedy at the beginning because it is often hard to understand the dialect at times.  Sit back and relax this somewhat slapstick British import.  My wife and I enjoyed it!
B00005RDRO|5.0|this movie is super funny.  adult humor but most will get it.  suspenseful murder mystery with lots of twists and turns.
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|Seriously, no deleted scenes, no director's cut, no alternate or extended scenes?  Or will that version be released in a few months so that everyone's forced to buy the film twice if they desire that material?
B00B2166BS|5.0|works great.<br />As described.<br />fast charge  with out worry about dammage to port. Attaches quick and easy. safely disconnects if cable pulled
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|What can you say about Sir Paul McCartney,<br />He gets you singing along in the shower and in the car<br />while you are listining to his music.<br />You can`t get better than THAT.<br />Everytime he breaths out PAUL comes out with a NEW and wonderful TUNE<br />SIMPLY THE BEST
B000OIZUW6|5.0|As I have found with all of the boods Follett has written that I have read, they keep you constantly interested and on the edge of your seat.  Although based in a time period long gone, there is enough remembrance of WWII that you could even get a little history out of them.  Thanks Ken Follett.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|My initial concern with the length of this Dan Brown story was soon alleviated once I began reading.  It kept my interest up and I now appreciate the abundance of research that good authors like Brown put forth in their novels.  I highly recommend it and am now enjoying the Di Vinchi Code and once again finding it's length an asset rather than a liability.  Three cheers Dan Brown.  You now have me as a loyal reader and fan.
0767821629|5.0|awesome sci fi type of movie that keeps you guessing until the end.  Great starring cast, awesomely written with special effects
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|For a final season, they aren't going out with a bang. Slow moving and extremely boring so far. I hope it gets better because this used to be a favorite show of mine.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I watched &#34;What to Expect When You're Expecting&#34; and could not wait for it to end.  It was very boring to me.  I feel that it was just too darn slow.  Not much of a story.  As I said this is just my opinion.  I prefer comedies and didn't think this was really very funny at all.  Very slow movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Once of the best weather applications out there. I do wish they would quit  giving winter storms names.  I do love the application.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to figure out. Challenging but not enough to give up. need to have more levels. Played it all in one sitting.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Eh, it works pretty well and I use it a lot. There's significant lag time when tab casting, and sometimes a loss of quality. It appears to work pretty well with netflix, although not anywhere near as responsive or seamless as the ads make it look. It basically is just a wireless VGA/HDMI adapter. I'm sure there will be some expanded functionality in the next year or so, but for now its very much still a beta product. It loses connection quite frequently and reboots a lot. But I'm decently satisfied.<br /><br />I find it to be HILARIOUS that this is Amazon's #1 selling product, and it is NOT compatible with Amazon Video. You think that would be the very first feature they would work on before releasing.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|this is an awesome series.  after seeing this season I could not wait to see the rest of the series.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It has wether alerts and it even tells you the forecast and videos. Love you wether channel<br />So I recommend getting this app best ever and hope you enjoy it to
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Quick read that gives the basics. If you want to get started writing your own e-books, this one is a good staring place.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|This movie was bad on so many fronts.  The plot was weak, the writing seemed to be poor and honestly it seems like shyamalan's movies have gone down hill so much year over year that he is left with dross like this.  The point of Science fiction is that it is based on believable science.  I hated the parts where the temperature would suddenly drop to an instantly freezing temperature every night, but the fauna would be fine the next day?  Basic understanding of biology seems to be thrown out the door on that.  While I don't think the acting of Will Smith's Son was as bad as some reviews said, I did feel like the writing for his Will's made his character so robotic as to be unbelievable.  I honestly can't believe he was in a movie like this.  Im a huge fan of his and believe his acting to be top notch.  It was sad to see it reduced to a role like this.  Overall the movie was really really bad.  I wouldn't suggest it for a rental even.
0783235607|4.0|I love most of Alfred Hitchcock movies, but this is his most famous and scary one of all. Think of the most vulnerable place a person can be, the shower. An isolated hotel, a guy who is a few shy of a six-pack and his best friend is his mother-CHECK PLEASE. The first time I saw it was when I was really young in the 70's. This movie has it all suspense, horror, and a naive girl who has no idea what she is in for. I just know when my mom saw it, she took baths for 2 weeks after seeing it. If you haven't seen this movie you are missing a classic horror flick the re-make is nothing compared to the original. I guarentee you will not be disapointed after seeing it, but you will become a little more cautious.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
1476727651|5.0|When I saw that Stephen King had a new book coming out, and that it was a sequel to The Shining, I was dying to get my hands on it. Back in March, I placed my order with Amazon. The closer the book's release date got, the more I started to wonder how much I really wanted to read it.<br /><br />The Shining is one of my absolute favorite of his books (tied with Pet Semetery and Bag of Bones, depending on which one I've reread most recently.) It wasn't the little boy that made me love that book so much, it was the Overlook and its ghosts. Reading about Danny as an adult? I wasn't sure how enthusiastic about that I was.<br /><br />I reread  The Shining for what was probably the fifth or sixth time while I was waiting for Doctor Sleep to show up in my mailbox. Then I curled up with the new book. And instead of being bored, I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />There are echoes, wonderful echoes, of the Overlook hotel. And there are new things to be creeped out by. The book had me scared, but not of whatever noises I might hear late at night after I'd closed the covers and tried to go to bed. I was worried about what the author might do to his characters -- he's not as nice in his more recent books.
B001KZN2PO|5.0|Nicholas Cage and John Travolta are amazing in this movie together.  This is an awesome example of versatile acting by everyone in this movie
B005SGXWII|1.0|The first two seasons were brilliant TV, there were often moments that made me laugh out loud.  The third season is wretched.  The laugh track is obnoxious and the humor has gone stale.  The first two seasons were clever and smart, this season is dull and unfunny.  There are very few television shows that require you to be aware and intelligent, it's a shame that Big Bang Theory gave up on that premise.<br /><br />The degradation between seasons is stunning.  It went from unique and creative to a cross somewhere between 'Friends' & 'Lavergne & Shirley'.  I think they upped the volume of the laugh track because they needed to telegraph the lame, unfunny and typical sitcom jokes.<br /><br />Plus there is a big change in the characters, with everyone becoming meaner and losing their charm.  The relationship between Leonard and Penny is unconvincing and unbelievable.  The first season revolved around science, now it's about bad relationships like any other sitcom.  Predictable and boring.<br /><br />Buy or rent the first two seasons and then walk away.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|with so many different challanges in each level you will never get tired of this game. seriously though a lot of games you get tired of but not this one! I love it and there are sooooo many levels!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|High if you are least expecting it to go play with kaleb isn't home from the dentist he put on my kindle yet to be comforted by thy great bounty hunter the graveyard and a
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read all three books in the series in a week.  I could not put them down.  I hope that there will be a followup.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Somewhat interesting story.  Not to diminish what he has done, but the book is very repetitious in it's descriptions of events.  Most interesting was how the troops have to defend themselves from liberal and politically correct upper echelon officers and politicians who would rather protect the enemy than allow the soldiers to do their job.  Hard to tell who the enemy really is:  the whining liberals or the Taliban.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I had hoped to learn more about the children who were put on these trains, not just a fictionalized version of what may have happened to one of them.  Still was interesting.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Written in unique style. A lot of symbolism. Not like  his others! Worth reading if you want something different. Can pick up and put down.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like others have commented this game takes patience which you will develop  otherwise you will spend a lot of money.  It really is a great game and worth the time. Has various modes of seek and find objects, very different from other hidden object game's I've played.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think should get 2 gems every day and it takes so long to get updates but other wise I love it and there should be more updates and worlds
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|A teacher must have!!!!  I heard this book at a Professional development session and feel in love with it.  I went right home and ordered a copy for myself and my daughter (who is also a teacher). I used this book with adults during a Professional development day as well as with elementary talented and gifted students.  Everyone loved it!  It lends itself to some wonderful discussion and extended writing.  I am now going to order another copy for my exchange student/teacher to take back to her country with her when she returns.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is by far the best and only search engine that I use. I have depended on it for many many years. It is the most remarkable window to the world. Thank you Google!
142311339X|5.0|This  is  a  really awesome  continuation  of  the  Percy  Jackson  story.  It  has  a  very  good  story. This  story  tells you  there was  another camp  fighting  in  the Titan war.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Tried many different solitary games, this one I've played for years. Thought maybe I'd try some of the newer ones, and ended up deleting them.  Easy to read, can make bolder numbers than others games.  It's locked up a few times, I just remove from kindle and 're-install.  Able to change card backs and colors.bY
B00139XSBA|5.0|I grew up with the space program, and have many books on the Apollo Program. This is my one - eminently quotable - history of the one that laid the foundation for everything that came after - Project Mercury.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This sci-fi movie has it all.  Great plot, excellant special effects,  super cast-all of which make it one of the most entertaining movies ever.  A joy to watch.  And it has Robby the Robot.  Enough said.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I love these old Star Trek programs. I started all the way back with season one. Just got caught up in the development of the characters and their relationships. Voyager is one of my favorite series of Gene Rodenberry's Star Trek.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|Exceptional for its time, great job by Norton, Gere fit his role pretty well in this one. My wife had not seen it before and enjoyed highly.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I play games at work on my breaks. I don't have internet access there. This game won't play unless I am connected. Looks promising but I'll never know. The first one was fun and didn't require internet. Not sure why this one does. I am not playing online and as it is paid, there shouldn't be ads.<br /><br />Disappointing. Was looking forward to it.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I've been listening to NKOTB since the Hangin' Tough lp was released.  Their latest album, 10, is another enjoyable pop/dance collection.  It didn't grab me right away musically like their prior album, The Block, did.  But, I was impressed that the lyrics on 10 are much less adult-themed than the Block...that was the one thing I didn't really like about that album.<br /><br />Some of the songs on 10 sound a little similar in style, but I don't mind because they're all pretty good.  There is a laid-back, smooth quality on a few songs.  I think The Block had more variety in sound, but most of the songs here are catchy and the guys' voices sound great.  Any New Kids fan should enjoy it.<br /><br />Update:  I recommend finding the song \\"With Me\\" that is on the Target version.  Why that song was not included on the regular edition of the album is a wonder.  It's one of the best songs from 10!
B0037LXTUW|4.0|We play this game from time to time. Some people get, other struggle (like me) Even so, the expansion bring much needed new picture to the game. You can't play it too often though, because folks start to memorize all the pics.
B007EC27QM|5.0|The best calculator on the market. Easy to use, great function, very good user interface. Thank you amazon for giving it for free today
B008JFUR10|5.0|Monsters from the deep invade coastal cities wreaking havoc and killing thousands.<br />The military can kill them but it takes a very long time while the monster is destroys everything in its' path.<br />Earth pulls together invents giant two-man robots that fight the monsters in epic hand-to-hand battles.<br />The monsters get bigger; there are more of them and fewer robots after each attack.<br />The giant robot project is scrapped in favor of a great wall.<br />The last three robots are shipped to Hong Kong.<br />A monster breaks through the wall protecting Sydney in an hour.<br />It is up to this last remnant to stop the monsters once and for all.<br /><br />Yes, we have seen this story many times.<br />Yes, the dialog is not timeless or even all that new.<br />Yes, you can tell what is going to happen.<br />Now, sit back, kick off your shoes, loosen your belt, turn off you mind and be entertained.<br /><br />The robot monster fights are something to see.<br />The acting and story work for this type of movie.<br />Most of all, this is a fun time for all but the youngest family members.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This season left us in suspense for what comes next! I am anticipating the next season will be very interesting. The characters in this show continue to grow and I have become very attached to them.
