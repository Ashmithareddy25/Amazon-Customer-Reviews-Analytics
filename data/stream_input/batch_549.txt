B00003CXDD|5.0|I don't think that this is a kid's movie. There are too many situations in it that should not be flaunted in a kid's face. But that is the only negative thing that I can say about it. I first watched this movie, about 20 years ago. I have had it on VHS that has been watched about a thousand times. And I have just recently got the DVD. I love fantasies. And that is exactly what this film is all about. Great actors/actresses. Great effects and a terrific story line. I love and will always love this movie.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|I'd like to say -Aeon Flux- is a great SF movie ... but i'd be lying.  This is -THX 1138- meets -Logan's Run-, barely capping the'intelligence' of those movies. & i do mean 'bare'.<br /><br />Charlize Theron [capable is a role little more than a cipher/stripper - MAN is she is shape!] stars as Aeon Flux, a 'rebel' who fights against the eeevil 'conservative' Goodchild regime.  But 1 can tell, the 1st time Flux is assigned her 'mission', that the person sending her out is planning to *sell* her out.  Flux' target [we learn eventually ... 'waaay too eventually] is her husband Trevor Goodchild [Marton Csokas, trying his best w/a script that's the wrong side of drek], cloned 7 times ... & so is Flux ... a clone, that is.  In fact, *every1* is a clone!<br /><br />There's no plot, no reason for Flux to kill the hundreds of faceless also-ciphers that i could see, and b****er-all sense to this senseless fable.  Avoid it ... unless [like Donald] you love beautifully-done stunts, perfect FX, & lovely CGI...
B00005JMUA|5.0|Cinematic brilliance.  Indulgent?  Of course!  It's Tarantino we're talking about here! But if you love what he indulges in these are the films for you. If you don't, then you'll probably be bored and annoyed.  He's an artist pushing the limits of his craft and basically making himself happy - and what's wrong with that?  Isn't that what so many artists would love - a chance to produce something totally their own? <br />KBV2 really hits its mark when we *finally* arrive at Bill's \\"lair\\" and meet Bebe. (Bebe?)  He slows the pace down and lets you sit back and savor the subtly brilliant naturalistic acting of Carradine. A mesmorizing force, Carradine rules every scene that he's in; it's almost like he's got you under some crazy thespian spell. <br />All in all, a fabulous film for those of you who love acting, dialogue, action, pushing of limits, and that self-indulgent factor named Quentin Tarantino.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|My husband bought this CD for me right before the birth of my daughter.  I have listened to it so many times and it brings tears to my eyes everytime because it reflects so many of the emotions new moms feel.  After my daughter was born, we listened to it together and \\"bonded.\\"  Even my husband loves the CD.  I have also used it as a lullaby CD.  My baby calms down as soon as it comes on.  I listened to it so much when my baby was a newborn that I had to put it away for a couple of months.  I have recently brought it out at 8 months and my daughter falls asleep to it.  I love this CD.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|one of the reviews stated that only the last 20 minutes of this film are any good...these are the same people who think Audition isn't any good until Asami starts torturing Shigeharu, it makes me sad to read things like that, but oh well. <br /> <br />on to the film.  this is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant foreign films of the last 10 years, and i may be taking a risk by saying that it's  quite possibly Korea's \\"Citizen Kane\\".  Everything about this film is so bitterly sweet, from the colors to the soundtrack, the storytelling is the epitome of suspenseful and heart wrenching, and good lord, not to mention Oh Dae-Su's plea for forgiveness at the end, which makes any Pacino or Brando role look like chopped liver. <br /> <br />i've seen this film 4 times now, and there are many more planned viewings, but every time i view this film it still floors me and leaves me choked up at parts. <br /> <br />oh, and a quick **** you to Hollywood, this doesn't need to be remade.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|This was a great cd. Christina's voice is absolutely beautiful on all of the ballads. The more upbeat songs are very catchy and definitely help put you in the holiday spirit. And the classics she remade like \\"This Christmas\\" are very well done, the originators would be proud of her. I love it and definitely think it should be in everyone's holdiay collection.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|Someone played a Bond song for me (Atlanta), and I liked, so I bought three Bond albums.  I had seen the warnings on the internet about some of them being unplayable.  Two of the albums I got were just fine, but this one refused to play. <br /> <br />I was forced to make a copy of the CD in order to use it, which is sad. <br /> <br />Classified and Remixed, the other two Bond CDs I got, worked just fine, but this one required me to jump through hoops.  If you are like me, and only have a computer (I use a mac mini to listen to music and watch my DVD collection) and not a standalone CD or DVD player, then you might want to skip this album to avoid being out the money for an unsuable CD (unless you are also a FreeBSD user, and can copy the disc).
B00000099Y|2.0|I find Tool amusing more than anything. I don't find them \\"bad\\" as such, just pretty average hard rock. But all this silly \\"intellectual\\"  and mystic stuff approaches Python-esque sillines. Oh I'm sure the fans lap it up, but from a  detached perspective it's like listening to my 10 year old son say \\"Hey dad I read some Schopenauer! Its cool! He was such a neat deep thinker and thought for years about all sorts of cool things\\" And why do 13 year olds smoke? Is it from enjoyment or do they want to make themselves look older? A lot of rock music is like that too. I myself was in a Blue Oyster Cult phase twenty years ago. behind the cool albums covers and mystic image lies a fairly decent pop/ rock band , not much else. Some things never change it seems.... <br /> <br />Tell you the truth when I was eleven I thought Return Of The Jedi was was \\"cool\\" too and lines like \\"You can either profit from this or be destroyed\\" convinced me that I was watching art of the highest calibre. 20 years later though and I now think it's just silly. But if I said that to the eleven year old boy that I was he would just have scoffed at me and said something \\"you've got no taste!\\" Likewise Tool has its fanbase of people who like to think they're listening to high art, but give it another ten years or so and you'll start to realise that such pretension in a rock band is really quite funny.  <br /> <br />I give two (or maybe 3 stars) to the music itself, but I would give zero stars to Tools attitude.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|My children listen to this cd every night. It is emotional and full of love, and makes me want to hug and cuddle my babies. Would make a great gift for new parents. It will grow on you more and more each time you listen to it.
0679422714|4.0|Mao: The Unknown Story is a gripping account of the life of history's greatest tyrant. Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have written a very accessible biography of Mao, who caused untold misery on his people, all in the name of trying to satisfy his own ego to have China (and therefore himself) as a superpower in world politcs. The Unknown Story explores and debunks many aspects of recent Chinese history which are tied in with the Chinese Communist Party and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and Mao's role within the Party.  <br /> <br />For example, as Chang and Halliday relate, some of the battles of the Long March transpire to be nothing more propaganda thought up by Chairman Mao as he was carried by porters on his recliner through the mountains evading the Nationalist army. He lead his army all over vast tracts of inner China in a bid to keep it out of conflict while other Chinese Communist leaders (and thus potential rivals) engaged the Nationalists and suffered losses. Mao was not above lying and decieving others, on more than one occasion ignoring radioed instructions from his superiors when those instructions did not suit him, even though his men would suffer horribly as a consequence. Mao also downplayed the extent to which the Russians supported the CCP.  <br /> <br />Mao was a superb manipulator, and one of the secrets to his success in gaining and maintaining the leadership of China was the playing off of opposing parties. Although being nominally on the same side as the Nationalist during the war, he actually welcomed a Japanese invasion of China in the late 1930's as a way of reducing the Nationalist grip on power, at a time when they were substanially stronger than the Reds. Another example of his machinations was getting President Nixon to visit China in a bid to gain access to military technology, a position the US were to take seriously due to Mao expressing fear of a Russian invasion, even though he knew this threat to be nearly non-existent, all the while maintaining the Chinese anti-American stance. Mao had also successfully used this ploy in the past against the Russians to gain nuclear weapons capability, using Taiwan and the US as the potential agressor.  <br /> <br />The callousness and blatant disregard of Mao for his people is staggering in the extreme, especially when one considers that he was asking his people to sacrifice what he himself was not prepared to. Mao lived a life of luxury, with numerous houses and villas around China especially prepared and maintained around the clock for the offhand chance that he may stay a night or two. At the same time, untold millions were starving to death due to Mao exporting much of China's agricultural products overseas to try and garner influence with the recipient countries. Needless to say, although the recipients of China's wheat and grain (including East Germany) were quite happy to accept the grain, they took no brook with Mao's attempts to influence their policy decisions.  <br /> <br />I'm no scholar, but to me the authors have certainly done their research, using extensive sources, which naturally include substanial use of Chinese sources. Russian sources are also used, which allows the authors to show the inner machinations of the Sino-Russia relationship, particularly in the early days of the CCP, when the Soviets were bankrolling the Red cause in China, and when Mao was forced to aceed to Stalin's will. I normally stay away from biographies of political leaders as I usually find them heavygoing, but unusually for a political biography, I found \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" easy to follow. This is helped by the fact the authors refrain from adding too many supporting characters, so it is relatively easy to avoid getting ovewhelmed by numerous characters popping in and out of the narrative.  <br /> <br />For me, and so it would seem for many other reviewers, this book is too biased against Mao to be taken seriously by many historians and academics. There is precious few positives (if any) that are offered by Mao, but that could be simply because there aren't any - Mao was really that unpleasant a man. However, rather than accept this, many will consider Mao: The Unknown Story to be nothing more than an attempt at character assassination even though it is nothing more than the subject deserves. However this does still detract somewhat from the book's credibility which is a shame, as I don't think the authors are expressing anything other than the truth.  <br /> <br />Despite the reservations expressed in the previous paragraph, this should not alter the fact that \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" is a well written, engaging biography of one of 20th century history's most pivotal characters. This is strongly recommended for anyone interested in Chinese history, particularly those readers who normally shy away from heavy reading. <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|I went and watched \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" on IMAX the week that it came out. It just happened to coincide with a visit to Chicago. <br /> <br />However, there were a lot of things in \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" that didn't make sense to me, that is, until I watched this movie the followed day on cable. <br /> <br />I highly recommend watching the movies in order, especially if you haven't read the books, because I had a lot of unanswered questions and didn't understand how things fit together. Also, watching \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" first, ruined some of the suspense and mystery in \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\".
0451169514|5.0|Many people like to compare books to the movies which are made after them. No matter what you thought of the movie, you would love this book. The details and word choices from Stephen constantly sent shivers down my spine. The little things he uses, the small off-to-the-side stories all tie up and have some significance in the end. IT is truly an enjoyable book for those who like to treat themselves to a good scare every once in a while, some good creepy stories. This is truthfully one of Stephen King's masterpieces.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movies is a classic in its own right... The action, comedy, all made this movie so memorable on so many levels. The movie was very well excuted with everything building up as it went on and made this movie so darn entertaing top notch.
B000001EUP|5.0|this is my favorite album from the scorpions. It is my favorite cd that came out in the '80 after Heaven & Hell(black sabbath). If you like rock or metal this really is something for you!
B0007XAWB2|3.0|I realize there is a serious cult following of this book/series that will never be convinced of any flaws.  And that being said, I bought this book really wanting to like it, but I just couldn't bring myself around.  Here's why: <br /> <br />1. As everyone else has said, the jargon is just plain tedious.  I can't excuse a book written in 200-year old sailing terms without a glossary.  At least 20% of the action is incomprehensible because of this.  Yes, you can press on like other reviewers have suggested, but that's frustrating at a minimum. <br /> <br />2. Sublety &lt;> Confusion -- I don't need my plots and narratives handed to me on a silver platter, and I certainly enjoy figuring puzzles out, but O'Brian seems to be trying to actively confuse the reader with his writing.  There are shifts in time/action/perspective that have nothing other than regular paragraph breaks between them.  Unfinished battles are left abruptly, and historical context is neglected. <br /> <br />3. This is not a stand-alone book.  It was written with the sole purpose of setting up the next 19, and as a result, has a an unsatisfying and rather predictable resolution. <br /> <br />So why 3 stars? <br /> <br />There is so much potential for greatness here.  The Jack/Stephen relationship is well developed and the sea battles were fascinating affairs.  And who doesn't like a good story about a maverick getting promoted through the ranks in spite of thumbing his nose at his superiors?  It makes me want to read more...well, I might try the first chapter of Post Captain.
B000002LCE|5.0|... it must be good. I am a real fan of R. Blackmore, and Craig plays his style. Dio is sings again as always good on this album. All The Fools Sailed away is my favorite song of all Dio's songs. It is the best song I've ever heard.     This is how I rate the songs:   - Night People 9/10   - Dream Evil 10/10   - Sunset superman 10/10   - All The Fools Sailed Away 10/10 -> Best song ever made by any band   - Naked In The Rain 7/10   - Overlove 10/10   - I could have been a dreamer 6/10   - Faces In The Window 9/10   - When A Woman Cries 8/10    It is a good album, you should buy it!
B00005JNZJ|1.0|Wow! What a dim-whitted movie! It's sad to see Science Fiction sink so abysmally low this year! What formula-film-trash! Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!<br /><br />The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!<br /><br />Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!<br /><br />Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional. I'll trade a low budget, low eye-candy film with a good story over this tedious trash, any day!<br /><br />Do us all a big favor! Don't encourage Hollywood to continuely make nonsense like Aeon Flux! Instead of trudging off to your local theater, treat yourself to a great film like the Matrix, or discover an old gem, like Zardoz! Maybe then, Hollywood will start diversifying again!
0060899190|5.0|I've been a fan of the PostSecret website for quite awhile. Its nice to have so many of the secrets, some of which I've seen before, in a book.<br /><br />Read secrets out loud, to a friend: They're a great conversation piece. Read secrets alone: They will, by turns, make you laugh, cry and think.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is that the postcards are enlarged, often taking a full page, or even two pages, of space. I would have preferred to see them closer to their actual size. You tend to lose the feeling that you're reading an actual postcard.
B000301YY8|5.0|I have yet to know any other musician as genuine as James Blunt. The first time I heard of James was about 2 weeks ago while watching a music video at 2AM on vh1.  I saw the \\"You're Beautiful\\" video and something just drew me to him.  After I listened to his full album I fell in love and I can't stop listening to him ever since.  I made sure I watched him on SNL since I was so mad at myself for missing his tour in TX. It's been a very very long time since I have heard such a great album.  His song \\"goodbye my lover\\" is one of my favorites and seems to push all the tears out of you that have been hidden for years. His experiences of pain in a lost relationship, fighting as a soldier, and friendship, are portrayed throughout his music with evident emotions. It's obvious why he is so successful all around the world after listening to him. I know his voice may be different but that's what the industry needs (think of Norah Jones & Maroon 5). I think his voice is unique, but that is what defines him and it works amazingly well.  I think it's beautiful (no pun intended).
B00028HBKM|2.0|I might as well start by saying that the use of dead languages in the movie was amazing. That is the only reason I rate this movie 2 stars instead of 1. <br />Now, where to begin? Why did Gibson make this movie? Well, Christianity is the largest religion that is currently in existence. If you create a movie that has 40% of Christianity buzzing, the other 60% will take notice. Would you believe that Sunday school children were actually taken to see this drivel? I can, know why? Gibson created one of those movies that make a whole group of people feel they have to see it. You ever see how many star wars fans lined up to see episode 2? That's because they felt they had to see it, no matter how bad it is. <br />Another thing that people blow out of proportion is how Gibson used his own money to make this movie. So what! He makes a couple million each movie he makes! And don't you think he kinda knew that it would be a box office smash? I mean a movie about Jesus created by Mel Gibson?! Cha-ching! If Gibson had donated the money to the Christian Children's Fund, then that'd be something. <br />Did you know that the Bible says very little about Jesus' death? It doesn't go in-depth like this trash does. What you basically are presented here is a snuff movie that shocks the moviegoer into paying attention.  <br /> <br />The basic idea behind this movie is that Jesus died for our sins; a theme that Gibson pounds into us as much as possible. He tries to display, as graphically as possible, the passion of Christ. This leaves many Christians open to saying things like \\"how can you still be a (non-Christian religion) when you just saw how much Christ suffered for you?\\" The ultimate guilt trip.  <br />A person shouldn't be forced to believe in something just because of how horrendously the \\"prophet\\" died. They should follow it because of what they taught. The fact that people went in droves to watch this filth is a real disservice to Jesus. Jesus taught love, forgiveness, and compassion. Why do you need a 3-hour movie to remind you of his teachings? Why do you need to be shocked into following his examples? <br />Let me also remind the reader that the passion has existed since the Middle Ages. Do we really want to go back to a time of fire and brimstone and all that jazz? Why drag an old, tired play into the 21st century? <br /> <br />And finally, I would like to close by saying this: I am not a Christian. I'm sure I made that abundantly clear. I was raised catholic but have since converted. I am a spiritual man and I am very open-minded. I believe in love and kindness and forgiveness. What hypocrites some of these reviewers are when they create reviews with titles like \\"A TRUE MASTERPIECE !! SHOWS HOW STUPID NON BELIEVERS ARE\\" That review was created by a person called \\"S.D.S\\" Look at his other reviews, he calls Dale Earnhardt some pretty horrible things. If you were a true believer then you would not judge him, since you are not God. And even if you were God, YOU'D FORGIVE HIM!  <br />As long as you live a good life, as long as you love your neighbor, as long as you forgive he that hurts you, you are living for the Lord. And you don't have to watch this movie to prove how much of a believer you are. So instead of wasting time to watch this horrible movie, why don't you volunteer at a homeless shelter, or donate the money you would have spent on this movie to a charitable organization?
B0002SROT0|5.0|I do believe this is Elliot Smith's best cd and I have listened to all of them many times, but I always return to this one. I did not know until tonight the story behind this cd. I knew he had killed himself but I didn't know it was before this cd came out(the story is in the next review).Now that I know the history behind it, the next time I listen will be in a different light. <br />This is a truly beautiful cd. The lyrics are sad but I do not get depressed or feel down while I'm listening to it at all. <br />Anyone who really appreciates independent music owes it to themselves to give this a listen.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Just buy it - Karen singing Silent Night is stunning at the least. This is the spirit of Christmas, better than Pavarotti. <br /> <br />I bought the Carpenter's Christmas 10 years ago on cassette. I feel lucky to now have a copy on CD.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|the first time i saw this movie, i was hooked. i couldn't get over it. it is funny and has it's drama moments as well. molly ringwald (i'm not too familar with her) shines in it. i love all the characters and actors. i give it 5 stars. it's sooooo halarious. i absoultely looove it. it's a great 80's movie i will enjoy over and over again.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.If you are like me and need background music to concentrate and work, this is the type of CD I would recommend. I have even found myself doing little dances to it, while I am wandering around in my home. To those of you who \\"ballet dance\\" in private, this CD is perfect...graceful, soft, even haunting at times. I think it strikes me as much less upbeat than the score from the 1995 version...it might be described as melancholy (excluding 2 or 3 of the livlier pieces featuring the militia and Lydia), and I love it for that. I feel as if it could be the soundtrack to my own life. As Mr. Darcy says, \\"You have bewitched me, body and soul!\\", this cd is truly bewitching...in one word: Divine!
0553801503|2.0|A Feast for Crows comes nowhere near its predecessors.  The plot is at best thin, and the novel becomes a travelogue for Martin's more uninteresting characters as they journey from point A to B.  Where is that sharp, tight novel with characters to care about and a plot that surprises?  If you do not expect too much from this book, you will not be disappointed.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I saw the live musical version years ago and I don't know, something just gets lost in the movie version. It seemed like \\"Christine\\" was lip-synching through the entire movie! I almost fell asleep! I'm so disappointed that I wasted 2 hours on it. I don't understand the glowing reviews this got at all. This was no Moulin Rouge. Even Chicago was better.
0977326403|5.0|As a non-profit leader, I've been waiting for this monograph to be published for several months, and Collins did not disappoint.<br /><br />In a lucid style that only Collins can deliver, he masterfully explains the subtle (but seismic) concepts of good to great for the social sector. Similar to his previous books, he effectively uses a broad array of real-life examples (e.g. the NYPD, a church, the Girl Scouts, the Cleveland Orchestra, a high school science dept), helpful graphics, and a very readable, conversational tone. Even though the monograph is only 31 pages, Collins contributes his clear thinking on numerous issues that will be very familiar to social sector leaders: how to measure success in non-$ metrics, how to recruit and motivate a passionate (and poorly-paid or unpaid) staff, how to think differently about \\"restricted funds,\\" and how to transcend systemic / external / industry-wide problems. I particularly enjoyed his discussion on \\"legistative\\" leadership (versus \\"executive\\" leadership in the business world). Collins predicts a dramatic reversal - that one day non-profit leaders, who have mastered legistative leadership, will be wooed away to lead for-profit businesses.<br /><br />This monograph does stand on its own. However, I think you would have to be fairly familiar with the concepts in Good to Great to fully appreciate its value.<br /><br />If you are still not convinced, you can also go to his website, jimcollins.com, to read 3-4 pages of snip-its from the monograph.<br /><br />Regardless, I would recommend this to every social sector leader.
B00005JO1J|5.0|I have never made a movie review- I usually wait until the movie comes to DVD before bashing it or praising it... but, this movie was EXTRAORDINARY. I just left the theater and the songs, feelings, and emotions are still playing in my head and right now I am so close to tears it is unbelievable.This is the best movie I have seen in years! And in my opinon is the last good show Broadway has ever done.<br /><br />I didn't become a \\"RENT\\" fan until seeing this AMAZING movie. Hearing the songs, the feelings of wanting to not be forgotten, and having someone to love you is are at the true heart of this movie. After the third song, I felt like all the characters in the movie were somehow friends of mine... and we have know eachother forever. Feeling comfortable with the characters and their feelings of inaddiqesce made me feel like I was going on this journey with them.<br /><br />A perfect cast with all your favorites from the orginal Broadway show. Each one of them perfectly cast in their role... give inspirational renditions of the songs that brought them to fame and inspiring performances!  Anthony Rap manages to somehow stand out among them though as though he is the \\"firm root\\" of their friendship- and sings powerful while adding comic relief when needed.<br /><br />All about trying to find yourself and express yourself in the 90s... no matter what your living is you'll be able to relate wether a doctor or an underrated actor. No matter what you'll love the movie. Relate to feelings of wanting something more while having to deal with \\"real world\\" issues such as paying rent, drugs, and diease. On a bad day \\"Rent\\" is considered the \\"Hair\\" of the 90s. Taking place when AIDs was virtually a fatal diease... you see the affliction and feel the pain for those in this movie afflicted. While you only lose one of those who follow you on the journey of these friends you can truly feel sad for those other characters you have met that are afflicted.<br /><br />I found myself falling in love with all of them as though they were actual friends...

B00006LPER|5.0|If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality.  Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself.  Her outward expression projects her desire.  That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.<br /><br />Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity.  He wants to become her student so as to be close to her.  She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in.  He falls in love with her.  Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.<br /><br />The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control?  The sadist or the masochist?  Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist?  It is hard to tell.  Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.<br /><br />But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak.  She is a sex extreme freak.  She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability.  Actually that isn't even true.  She says she doesn't care what others think.  She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love.  Love, she calls it.  For her sex and love are one and the same.<br /><br />At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything.  How ironic such a superfluity is to her.  How gratuitous the comment.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within).  He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another.  This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone.  Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery.  We don't need to see any more.<br /><br />The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them.  I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul.  Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense.  What matters to her is the performance and the challenge.  No part is too demanding.  No character too depraved.  It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does.  She is always fascinating and nearly flawless.  She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.<br /><br />I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentelli&egrave;re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old.  There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser.  Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician.  Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.<br /><br />Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets.  (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.)  In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty.  Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.<br /><br />Do see this for Isabelle Huppert.  You won't forget her or the character she brings to life.ructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.<br /><br />Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|Reliable sources in my local paper have been able to shed light on a release being planned by Mariah, right on the brink of Christmas Eve. Apparently, the sales generated by this re-release, have caused camp Mariah to consider a new edition, which will aim to give Mariah a diamond certification. <br /> <br />Details are vague at the moment, but fans are told to expect a new version of the DVD, which will feature the video for 'Don't Forget About Us, as oppossed to the web-link featured on this edition. Also, a bonus 3rd disc will be included, and will feature popular remixes of tracks from the album, including 6 new mixes of We Belong Together. The packaging will consist of a box, making it perfectly wrappable for that special christmas gift!! <br /> <br />Specific details about the release will come to light once the official press releases come through, but i can't help but feel physically sickened by the thought of another version of this album. What's even worse, is that fans will flock to purchase it. Very sad day in Mariah's career I think!!
0670033375|5.0|This is an outstanding piece of work, in some ways even better than Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1997) which I highly recommend.  Here, instead of explaining why wealth and power accrued to European states and not, for example, to South America states, Diamond demonstrates mostly how some societies failed.  Along the way he contrasts the failures with some successes, and in the latter part of the book addresses current problems and possible solutions.<br /><br />He begins with modern Montana, specifically Bitterroot Valley, a society in danger of failing because of deforestation, pollution, loss of productive top soil, and other factors.  He follows this with Part 2, \\"Past Societies\\" in which the melancholy history of Easter Island and some other Pacific Islands is retold in fascinating detail.  I was especially interested in the material on Easter Island, which, because of its relative isolation from the rest of the world over many centuries, has always served in my mind as a microcosmic cautionary tale for the entire planet. Although I have read other books about Easter Island and have seen a couple of documentaries, I found Diamond's exposition full of new information, offering fresh insights into how that society collapsed.<br /><br />Also delineated in remarkably readable detail are the collapses of the Anasazi of the US southwest, the Maya in Mesoamerica, the Viking-founded colonies in the north Atlantic and especially in Greenland.  There is some excellent material on how Iceland succeeded (barely) and how the New Guinea highland people managed to avoid the fate of some other Pacific Island societies, and why Japan succeeded in saving its forests and croplands in the time of the Tokugawa.  Note that these stories are primarily about ecological successes or failures, not successes or failures due to political or military misadventures.<br /><br />What surprised me about the failed societies is that the most destructive thing the people did was cut down their forests to plant food crops.  Again and again, from Easter Island to Greenland, the effect of cutting down trees was devastating because it allowed wind and rain to remove the topsoil, either blowing it away or washing it down gullies and rivers into the sea.  In the case of Easter Island, using up all the timber resulted in an inability to fish since without wood the people could not build boats.<br /><br />People also clear forests to create pastures for grazing their livestock.  This also proved disastrous in some cases, especially when the animals were sheep and goats, who typically graze right down to the roots of plants, and can thereby quickly strip the vegetation from great tracks of land.<br /><br />But the common link between all societal ecological disasters is simple, and one of great importance to us all today.  All those societies--Easter Island, the Maya, the Anasazi, etc.--allowed their populations to grow beyond the carrying capacity of their environment.  That is the bottom line for all of humanity.  Hungry people do desperate things, as Diamond recalls in the chapter on Rwanda.  When too many people share too little space and resources, laws and morality break down, governments fall and people kill one another massively.  All peoples do this.  No human race or ethnic group is exempt.  It could happen here.  Diamond's book is a warning that we all need to hear and appreciate.  We are part of the ecology, and not above it.  We need to live in harmony with the rest of the planet and not imagine that we can treat the planet and its resources with carelessness, abuse and neglect.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Diamond gives his prescription on how we might avoid the fate of the failed societies.  He notes on page 214 that bad things can happen \\"when parents take good care of their individual children but not of their children's future.\\"  He is referring to the parents of European friends\\"who bought life insurance, made wills, and obsessed about the schooling of their children,\\" but \\"blundered into the disaster of World War II.\\"<br /><br />I think Diamond nails it with this observation.  Today's soccer moms (and dads) with all our affluence and all the care we put into our children's and grandchildren's future may be failing because we are not electing the kind of leadership that will provide for their future.  High deficients (greedily borrowing from our children and grandchildren) and lack of consideration for the environment, through the depletion of fossil fuels and the pollution of fresh water sources and the air, etc., may completely override anything we might do for our children.<br /><br />Diamond also says that at some point societies have to realize which core values are worth maintaining and which no longer make sense in light of current circumstances (p. 440 and elsewhere).  He cites the example of the Greenland Norse who maintained their European values and lifestyles and died out when they might have survived had they taken on the Inuit lifestyle and learned to hunt ringed seals and whales and build igloos.  Additionally there is the sad example of Easter Island where they continued to worship greedy gods (and their priests) and built statues instead of using their resources to maintain their forests and topsoil.<br /><br />I think Diamond's argument especially applies to the false gods some people follow today, the Bronze Aged gods of fundamentalist religions who fear progressive change and continue to seek solutions through violence, intolerance, and the defeat of \\"enemies.\\"<br /><br />In reading about the various collapses here one is struck by what they had in common.  In every case there were too many people chasing too few resources.  At peak times on Easter Island or among the Maya, great monuments were build to celebrate the society's success.  And then came the fall soon after.  Diamond warns that the crash is typically not gradual like human senescence, but abrupt, following fast on the heels of the society's finest hour.ssed about the schooling of their children,\\" but \\"blundered into the disaster of World War II.\\"    I think Diamond nails it with this observation.

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I just finished watching this movie, and I thought it was fantastic. The storyline, albeit cliche, was well done, and the fine acting made it enjoyable to watch. Kurt Russell is hysterical as the Superhero father. <br /> <br />I won't bother going into the plot, because I see on here that it's already laid out. The reason I gave this movie high marks is because it had mass appeal. You could sit a five-year old in front of this movie, and they would be rapt by the special effects. You could show it to teens and preteens and they would empathize with the characters. You could watch it as an adult and just be throroughly entertained by it from start to finish. <br /> <br />All in all, the money I paid for the DVD, I feel is money well spent. It is definitely a movie you could watch over and over again. <br /> <br />So if you're thinking about buying it for someone young, go right ahead. There is nothing risque in the storyline. If you're thinking about buying it for yourself for a fun night of movie watching, go right ahead. You won't be disappointed.

If you love C&H as much as I do, then this is a great deal. If you are new or giving it to someone not familiar with this, it would be better to give them a smaller collection.
0345440900|1.0|As a mother to an 18 month toddler who has read just about every book on baby & sleep out there and tried every method, let me be brutally frank about how wrong the book is about getting babies to sleep.  Like other first time mothers,  I desperately wanted to believe that this book's promise of \\"no cry sleep solution\\" would work.  I couldn't stand my baby cry for a minute and couldn't imagine the alternative self-soothe method.  But I tried the no cry solutions suggested in the book - ritual, rocking, putting them to bed when they are sleepy but awake, if they wake in them middle of the night, taking them out and rocking them and then putting them back into their crib.  I tried this book's sleep approach for over 4 months.  There was no improvement in my baby's sleep. What really got me to stop listening to this book was that one night, after the rituals and after an entire hour of rocking him, my baby was so sleepy but would not let go of me, that he tossed and turned in our bed and accidentally hit his head on our bed's headboard so hard that he lost consiousness.  I decided that this is not the way to teach a baby how to go to sleep.  I read two other books on sleep by doctors who have professional training and research on infant sleep and found that they had very different perspective than this book.  The two books - Sleeping Through the Night by Dr. Jodi A. Mindell and Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Dr. Marc Weissbluth - both advocated the cry it out/self-soothe method.  I did a large poll of mothers and found that 90% of those who were happy with their babies sleep had in fact used the cry it out/self-soothe method.  So I decided that I really should try this alternative even though it was with great anxiety that I embarked upon sleep training my then 13 month old .  I worried and obsessed and was really scared to start it.  But it really really does work.  The first night of sleep training, my baby cried 10 minutes.  The night six nights he cried abouta minute each night.  After a week he went to sleep happily.  After two weeks, he no longer woke up in the middle of the night.  He is now sleeping 11-12 hours through the night and is a very happy boy. I wished that I had not read Tracy's book and had instead read the Mindell and Weisbluth sooner.  Avoid the sections about sleep in this book - getting your baby to sleep enough, sleep through the night, or getting babies to go to sleep on their own - it didn't work for me.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|What are you people smoking? This has to be one of the most contrived, self-absorbed records in the last 20 years! I cant believe all the raves this disc is getting. It does not deserve that much praise i will tell you that. I listened. I analyzed. What was my conclusion? That this is a mockery of a wanna be blues album. Nothing about it impressed me. Go back to your testosterone-less acoustic phlegm, you cant play the blues mayer, and when you do ...its so obvious you are a boy trying to play man's music... and not doing a very good job of it.
B000AP04EW|3.0|I saw this movie twice.  The movie deals with everyday marriage problems that all couples face after the honeymoon period is over.  I love the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Instead of making a boring movie about how to work things out between married couples, this movie is an adventure.  <br /> <br />The movie's ending needs to be better.  There are lots of loose ends.  We never know who the bad guy is.  We don't know if they continue to be assasins after the shootout scene.
0740748475|5.0|Not only was \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" the best comic strip of the past 20 years, it was, with a few exceptions, just about the only good one. In fact, if my local paper hadn't started rerunning old \\"Calvin\\" strips to promote this collection, I probably wouldn't read the comics pages at all. If you're a fan, you know it combines simple profundities about life and childhood with genuine, unforced humor, and writer/artist Bill Watterson's drawings are simple but perfect. (Calvin himself, of course, has become an icon, while Hobbes could have been the most popular stuffed animal ever if Watterson had allowed merchandising. And Calvin's mom and dad may be the most realistic-looking parents in a comic strip ever.) I agree with some of the critics here that it would have been nicer to have an easily readable complete set of paperbacks than these Oxford English Dictionary-size volumes, but I'd rather have this collection than miss a single strip. At least this one can be kept on the shelf for children and grandchildren to discover, while adults can go back to it and read a few pages they'd forgotten whenever they feel like it. I know that Watterson gave up the grind of daily comics to focus on more \\"serious\\" art, but if this turned out to be all he did with his life, it would be plenty.

B0002SROT0|5.0|Another great album by Elliott Smith, every song is poetic and complements the music around the words perfectly, any album by Elliott is worth picking up and this unfortunatley is now his final album due to his untimely death. He will however be remembered as a talented and emotive songwriter who did not release a bad album and came up with some of the most stunning songs i've heard and from a basement on the hill is definatley a cd worth picking up although not my favourite, figure 8 and xo take that crown.
B000AP04FG|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It got so much hype and airplay in the media I was really expecting a decent entertaining movie.  The acting was abysmal.  Brad Pitt was even worse than Angelina Jolie, which is really saying something.  The action sequences were so ridiculous that I couldn't even sit back and just enjoy the \\"fluff\\".  There isn't one redeeming thing I can say about this movie.  Don't waste your time or your money.

B000B8QEYC|3.0|Like so many other reviewers, I too am a HUGE fan of Enya's and own all her albums, listen to them regularly, and have been long awaiting the release of a new album! Five years without a new Enya CD is a very long time, so excitedly, I purchased this CD the day it was released. First time listening to it, I was indeed disappointed. It sounded as if--for all the talent that Enya has--that she has suddenly reduced her songs to a limited range of 4 or 5 notes, up and down the scale---over and over and OVER again! Talk about monotony! Now, however, as I've listened to the CD about 15 times, I'm beginning to hear more depth to the pieces, and I'm starting to enjoy the CD more with each listen. I definitely feel that this CD is an \\"acquired taste\\" and that it takes time and SEVERAL LISTENS to enjoy it. I unabashedly feel that this is NOT Enya's best work! One would think that after five dry years, she would produce something really fantastic, especially since there's only 12 songs on this CD. Like so many other reviewers have mentioned, each song seems to sound so much like other Enya songs from the past--or worse, like other songs on THIS very CD, as they all tend to blend together and sound so much alike that you can't quite tell where one ends and another begins. That said, however, now that I've listened several times, I'm beginning to appreciate it a bit more, and can actually admit to LIKING several of the songs. (I am, however, still trying to figure out the NEED for a fictional Loxian language, no matter how pleasant-sounding it might be....Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic?)  I suppose my favorite song is \\"The River Sings\\" because of its refreshing upbeatness in--what seems like--an otherwise sea of slothfulness (although, I'm still trying to figure out the NEED for a FICTIONAL language [i.e. Loxian] on this CD, no matter how pleasant-sounding it may be. Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic?  Why the need to make one up for a music CD such as this? Afterall, this music is NOT the soundtrack to a movie like Lord of the Rings...) For personal reasons, I've become very attached to the song, \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\", because when I listen to the song, I think of my Mom, who is in heaven, and I wish I could \\"find a way to bring her back home\\". The hymm-like quality of this song, coupled with the lyrics is very moving to me, but as I said, for personal reasons.     (At the risk of repeating myself--but then, why not? Enya surely does it....) so much of this CD is repetitive and redundant, and it seems a bit like \\"leftovers\\".  For example, The song \\"Long Long Journey\\" could well be titled \\"On My Way Home, Part II\\", and \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" (the MOST redundant song on the CD) could be \\"One by One: Continued\\" (and to answer your question, Enya, \\"Is there a reason?\\" NO! There isn't! They simply said goodbye! Can't that be good enough? One time asking would have been MORE than enough for this song... MUST you really REPEAT this question over and over and over for EVERY SINGLE LINE OF THE SONG????!! Sheesh!)    Enya fans will, of course, give this CD a try. But if you're not an Enya fan already, this CD will not inspire you, nor make you a fan. Try \\"Paint the Sky With Stars\\", or \\"Watermark\\"....or for that matter, ANY of Enya's other CDs, in order to REALLY appreciate her work.  I am giving this CD 3 stars because I don't feel that it deserves QUITE 4. If I could, I'd give it something like 3.75.

So lets all join up and vote for this Electric Dreams to be electrified right onto this DVD version! <br />I remember so much about this movie that I would love to see it again in a widescreen format. This movie is a romantic comedy that will fill your fantasies for years to come. It also has great music and songs especially the cello music where Virginia Madsen's character plays her instrument with a computer who also plays the same exact music with a different tune. If people at MGM is reading this, please take note of this and release this wonderful movie onto DVD cause we who loved the movie would want this to come true for us. Make our dreams come true by releasing Electric Dreams onto DVD so we can enjoy it over and over again for the rest of our lives as this movie rocks!

B000AAF276|5.0|It is a must have. If you are trying to decide on which version to buy as a gift, get the more expensive dual-disc version. Your fan gift recipient will thank you! Any Clapton fan will tell you that he sounds different on various albums and with different groups, so yeah he sounds different on this album. He is evolving like all great music legends do through their career. My husband is a huge fan and loves to collect Clapton music and videos. He had the original version, but then saw the dual-disc version and immediately wanted it. The collectible guitar picks are a nifty touch for fans and the DVD is an excellent quality production that fans will appreciate, both for the interview and for the performances. If you like these types of extras you will be very happy with the DVD. As for the music, many people have said it is not his best and not typical Clapton. I don't agree. With a repertoire like Clapton's it would be impossible to pick a \\"Best\\" anyway. I admit the change in style from one song to the next is unusual at first, but the songs grow on you. I look at it like this. If you like Eric's music as a whole, then you will like this CD. I know fans who were not really turned on when he ventured into different styles like doing the \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" album. Then again, true fans would know that some of the stuff that is considered to be among the best of Clapton - like the Cream music - is not necessarily the music that Clapton himself preferred. So, while that music may be the \\"best\\" for a fan, it is not the \\"best\\" fit for Clapton - and that is according to Clapton himself. Cream broke up because Clapton wanted to do music that fit his style better. He has enough clout to be able to do that in more recent years, and he is following his own path. Fans who truly appreciate his musical interests and influences as well as his music will appreciate these albums more. I think any fan who truly enjoys Clapton's music collection as a whole will appreciate the diversity of this album's mix and the fact that this is music that Clapton is really interested in personally. This is a glimpse into the true artist through various windows.ty of this album's mix and the fact that this is music that Clapton is really interested in personally.

B0001LJC2K|1.0|Not only do these guys not add anything to music but they create the illusion of good music which is far worse.   <br /> <br />This band does not fall into the same genre as Radiohead.  Radiohead did not create a genre, they create music.  It's just a bold and nearly successful attempt at capitalizing on what Radiohead has accomplished.  The reason it is nearly successful is that listeners who are not highly discerning and who are into music for the image will listen to this, equate it to Radiohead, and delude themselves into thinking they know good music. <br /> <br />Don't worry, though.  It does not degrade Radiohead in the end because those who know better will know better.  It's not enough of a parasite to really cause any damage.

B00006M183|4.0|Caveat: I think that the best reviews for this album were by Mohlman here in Amazon and by Rolling Stone.    When I bought this CD my knowledge of Pearl Jam was limited to 7 songs (4 from Ten, Do the Evolution, Brother and Better Man). However, even though I knew so little, it was obvious to me that Pearl Jam deserved a lot of respect. So as I started playing the CD, and finding myself not liking it, my immediate response was, \\"idiot, now you can't even appreciate good music!\\"    However, it seems I was wrong. After a week I was able to, little by little, see the gem that is Riot Act.     Two tracks that I can't stand, though: Arc (Vedder's \\"song of grief\\" which I don't think is a song at all--just Vedder wailing away) and Help Help (in which Vedder's voice in falsetto is very, very annoying).     Likewise, the are two outstanding tracks: Thumbing my Way and All or None. Anyone who has ever really hitchhiked (I mean weeks on end) will understand this song. The pointless questions \\"lingering over head,\\" the ennui of \\"counting steps\\" to pass the time, and a pervasive guilt, for all we've done wrong, that will just not go away. All or None is similarly powerful. Its about someone with such high ideals for himself that must either achieve it all, or else he'll have nothing at all. Moreover, its about the depression that ensues when such men realize that no matter what they do, they'll fail, and will thus need to settle with nothing. Again, it's a profound and moving track. Also, both songs are musically simple--for the most part just acousting guitars--something which, of course, adds to their melancholy.    Then we have some very good tracks like Love Boat Captain (the anthemic rocker of the album, dedicated to the nine men who died at Rockslide), Ghost (about running away from the emptiness/numbness of modernity), I Am Mine (about the ideals of agency), You Are (love song), Green Disease (against greed) and Bu$hLeaguer (against Bush; and though I don't dislike Bush asmost people find cool to do, the song is very funny and witty).    After this we are left with some good, solid tracks like Can't Keep, Save You, Get Right, Cropduster and 1/2 Full.    I haven't said much about the music per se, since I don't know much about instruments and such. Nonetheless, the lead guitar on You Are is pretty innovative (I've never heard anything like that). Someone said Cameron drove a guitar through a drums-amplifier to get that sound; I'm not sure, though. Also, 1/2 Full, like Mohlman said, would have made Stevie Ray Vaughn proud.    All in all, its a very good CD. However, I listened to Riot Act while also listening to Ten. And the differences are blatant. The music notwithstanding, Vedder is changed. Like the Rolling Stone reviewer commented, it's as if Vedder got tired of big, showy anthems; instead, he takes a step back in this record. With a subdued voice, he tries to subtly impart his always-profound messages. Very different from songs like Once, Evenflow, and company!    Actually, since Keith Larris from Rolling Stone is much more eloquent than me, I'll let him finish:    \\"Songs such as 'Can't Keep' fall subtly into their choruses rather than explode into anthems because Vedder and his mates are too honest to indulge in the showboating of today's power balladeers. Anyone can fake a heroic stand in the studio. It's more challenging to quietly voice your need to take a step back.\\" ([...])
0688170528|4.0|Jodi Picoult once again takes the reader to that uncomfortable area of storytelling that most of us will never encounter in our own lives.  Here is the story of true love, young love, and what one does for the sake of love.  The raw emotions expressed by the main characters - Chris and Emily - childhood friends turned young lovers, was so gripping it made me remember my own adolescent angst.  Any adult reading this book that cannot relate to Chris or Emily should consider themselves lucky and, well... possibly a bit un-normal.  I cannot imagine a teenager that at one point or another doesn't contemplate suicide as an option to their problems.  What Picoult does so well is capture that gut-wrenching feeling of these young lovers and gives us a glimpse of their lives together up until that very last second.  While I would have liked to see more time devoted to Emily's decision to commit suicide and less time spent on the lawyer and his life, I still feel this story was extremely compelling and real.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira came along during the Latin explosion of the late 90's except unlike many who populated the genre, she wasn't born and raised in the United States nor was English her first language. Her lack of experience in the language showed on her first English speaking album, Laundry Service, she made up in presentation and was much more experimental than the Latin pop of Jennifer Lopez or Ricky Martin whose songs all sounded alike. <br /> <br />After taking a couple years off, Shakira came back this year with two albums, back in July she released the Spanish language Fijacion Oral vol. 1 (translation Oral Fixation) that featured La Tortura, a song with so much sexual tension even American didn't need a translation, and more recently she released the English language Oral Fixation vol. 2 (translation Fijacion Oral). There are two songs that overlap both albums, the lovely Something and the uplifting The Day and the Time. <br /> <br />Volume 2 actually starts of with some people chanting the Lords Prayer. I think this is the first time chanting was included in a pop song since Enigma scored their only hit with Sadness part 1. But the song, How Do You Do, quickly turns into a rocker about the violence that surrounds religion with lyrics like, \\"How many people die, and hurt in your name? Hey, does that make you proud, or does it bring you shame?\\" Apparently George Bush and Osama bin Laden have the answers. <br /> <br />After the opener, Shakira deals with a failed relation on Don't Bother and Illegal, the later which feature Carlos Santana and his trademark guitar and sound like a more somber version Underneath Your Clothes claiming \\"it should be illegal to break a woman's heart.\\" Don't Bother, on the other hand is a more upbeat kiss-off to a former flame who is trying to reunite. <br /> <br />Even though this time around Shakira seems to master the English language a little better, her strong point is still in the presentation. And it seems as if she has been listening to a lot of American 80's since her last album. During How Do You Do, there is a guitar solo that song very similar to Edie Brickell's What I Am, while on Don't Bother, the guitars seemed to be borrowed from the Cure's Just Like Heaven. The bouncy Hey You sounds like something out of the Stray Cats catalog had a female been the lead singer. And she even seems influenced by bands who themselves like the 80's retro sound as The Day and the Time sound much like The Killer's Smile Like You Me It. But she does go old school Latin music with the inclusion of mariachi horns on Animal City. But in each case she is able to make it her own. <br /> <br />The album ends much like it starts off but instead it's a children's choir that does the chanting on yet another 80's influenced Timor which relays heavy on synthesizers and drum loops. But instead of religion, politics is the topic with the kids asking throughout the song, \\"How about the people who don't matter anymore?\\" Taking aim at the apathy that plagues the youth around the wealthy world who care more about what's on MTV than those less fortunate who are dieing whether it be by war or by hunger.
B000B0WODA|2.0|To me this is nothing like as good as their debut album. The songs are less interesting, less catchy, less memorable. I tried to like it, I've played it through many times now, but it just isnt growing on me at all. <br /> <br />It's not as if they've changed their sound much either, although they have upped the tempo a bit and it's a bit more \\"in your face\\" but really I think they could have done with taking a bit more time making this album.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think she has really matured, and I really love the new CD. Her songs have a real meaning to them unlike some other songs. I love how she is multi talented, because she plays so many instruments. Her songs have a great message. <br />\\"Who knows\\" really is a good message and \\"Freak out\\" is what some people are doing when they write these reviews
B000A6T1JU|5.0|No, this film isn't \\"realistic,\\" exactly.  It's more of an urban mythology.  The story is rooted in greek history, which this version of the film explains in the beginning.  It's also an urban version of Homer's the Odyssey, in many ways, about a perilous trip back home.  Anyone with an intimate knowledge of that work will see it played out in this film.      There are instances that recall the Greek Sirens... parts in the film where our heroes are suduced by film fatales and come close to meeting their doom or, in one case, get busted.      WHY NO GUNS?    The  gangs  in this film are a different kind of gangster.   Rather than cap each other off, these guys are a \\"street fighter\\" variety of gangster.  These gangsters don't come across as a result of poverty or social ills.  These  are more like a bunch of stupid kids  who join a gang because it's a fad or they just want to prove something.            A great film!
B0000AQS6R|4.0|4.5 stars.  I would have to say that this is my favorite Christmas movie.  My wife and I picked up the DVD Special Edition (which isn't that special, come to think about it -- just one trailer and a commentary track).<br /><br />It's rated PG-13.  I didn't remember anything all that caustic in it, so we let our four year old watch it.  Yikes.  There is a lot of swearing in this movie.  At one point, our daughter looked at us, giggled, and said \\"That man said bull sit!\\"  That's what she really said, but that wasn't what the man said.<br /><br />So, I'm in the dog house tonight because it was my idea to watch it.  Please, avoid this predicament by screening this movie if you aren't sure you want your kids using the words that the actors use.<br /><br />That said, I love the heck out of this movie.  It is well-acted, and well-scripted.  There are a lot of great bits such as the cat under the chair, the sled, the squirrel in the tree, Cousin Eddie and the sewer drain.... the list goes on and on.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you buy it right now and watch it without delay.  Anyone that has ever attended a family Christmas will find a lot to laugh about.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, same thing.  This is a must-see Christmas movie on par, I think, with \\"A Christmas Story.\\"
B00028HBKM|2.0|Purely from the point of view of watching the movie it was amazing.  The film costs here were amazingly well spent (thats what the stars are for).  To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing.  I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that's ok -<br /><br />  I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ, even though there is no scriptural evidence for them.  Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents.  It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins.  As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus's life is his death.  It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.<br /><br />Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines.  If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors.  In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation, an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to \\"people behaving badly\\".  It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation.  The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins.  (which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and doesn't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ...so it is pretty much a wash) The moral message needs to come from Jesus's life...take care of lepers, eat with tax collectors, help a prostitute get on her feet.  Things get a little messed up but its not anything that cannot be fixed by simply doing human things.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I'm not going to try to be wordy or witty, I just need to say that this is a great album, and is even better than the first (quite a bit better, in my opinion). This is another one I downloaded and then went and bought. The vocal have even more gratuitous falsetto than the first album, and the lyrics make even less sense, but the overall experience leaves very little to be desired. It has the \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" tag on it, but the only curse words I found was where he drops the \\"f\\" bomb twice in \\"English Country Garden,\\" and you really can't understand it anyways. Great album. get it...
B00007KLJJ|3.0|\\"The Four Feathers\\", directed by Shekhar Kapur is the sixth film version of the classic novel by A. E. W. Mason. The many reviews of this film can be grouped into two prominent points of view. One half of the reviewers rated the film based on the technical aspects (such as how well this movie portrayed actual history, accuracy to the book and how well it reenacted Mason's ideas). The other group reviewed this film from simply an entertainment point of view and rated it on how much they enjoyed it. The group that looked at the movie from a technical point of view, disliked it. Those that ignored the technical aspects seemed to be happily entertained.  <br />   From a technical point of view, I feel that Kate Hudson was an unfortunate choice of actress for this character. She didn't have the right personality and mannerisms to fit the role and seemed too \\"American\\" for the role of this English lady. Also I believe that the film did not spend enough time developing the characters. This made it hard for me to understand their decisions and empathize with their feelings. <br />   I really enjoyed the settings in this film and the beauty of the shots. Although there were some lulls in the pace, the storyline kept a decent tempo. I had the feeling that some sections had too much of a melodramatic feel. The action sequences were quite exiting and the story itself was entertaining but did not have much depth. <br />I agree with the arguments made by both sides.  It would have been nice if the characters had been more developed, if some of the scenes had been cut a bit shorter and, if possible, some of the melodrama removed. I was happy with how it was beautifully filmed.  <br />   Overall I enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to those who are looking for simple, unchallenging entertainment.
B000028U0Y|5.0|History lesson.  Around the time this album was recorded, 1 OUT OF EVERY 5 RECORDS SOLD IN THE WORLD, WAS A JOHNNY CASH RECORD.  That's how much of an impact this man made on music.  Columbia Records chastized him for wanting to record an album of a prison show, but John R. Cash new his audience and once again sailed against the wind.  The result is probably the greatest live album ever recorded in any genre.  It's as real as rain.  No slick production, or smooth sound here.  Just the real Johnny Cash.  He even sings a song written by one of the inmates, Glen Shirley.  He'd never even heard or played the song untill the night before, but \\"Greystone Chapel\\" is one of is one of the most powerful performances here.  This is a must have for anyone who loves and appreciates American music.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Along with It's a Wonderful Life, this is a must see Christmas film every year. This one will have you laughing every few mintues or so and will get you in the Christmas spirit for sure. So cuddle around the fire and enjoy this classic during the holiday season.
068484267X|5.0|This is a truly remarkable book. Using an energetic style which conveys the intense tumult of his youth in Limerick, Ireland,  McCourt packs into whole paragraphs, sometimes huge unpunctuated run-on sentences, the horrors and wonders of his childhood. I can't contend with any of the thousands of reviews here, and probably echo what each says: This is a modern classic. McCourt gives away the struggles he and his family went through for decades, but through it all the book remains full of love, wonder, trimuph of spirit and will, exuberance and hope.  <br />A five star book, sometimes too painful to get through, but written with a spirit like no other I have ever read.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Description from TV.com: \\"Set five hundred years from today in a new planetary system after humanity abandons \\"Earth That Was\\". Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds, a renegade who fought against the new unified central government (the \\"Alliance\\"), the crew of the Firefly-class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can. They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar.\\"<br /><br />So you haven't watched the tv series Firefly? No biggie. You can jump right in to this great flick without the pre-knowledge of each of the characters and enjoy it all the same (though the enjoyment is multiplied for fans of the show).<br /><br />Characters: We have depth to characters here, no one-dimensional action heroes. Everyone has a different motivation and nothing is cliche that I can think of off the top of my head<br /><br />Plot: This is a wrap up to the series in some regards but also makes it so a new series can take off at any given point. The story is more functional in giving us background on the Alliance, River & Simon Tam and Reavers. . .all of which were a big boon and highly appreciated.<br /><br />Setting: You got to love the western/sci-fi feel of this flick. It makes it adventureous and a sense of discover because we finally break from the traditional Star Trek and Star Wars worlds that have been overly exploited over the years. I actually appreciate there are no \\"alien humunoids\\" in this movie/show.<br /><br />Action: The trailer made me wince thinking the fight scenes were going to be pretty weak, but with the right direction and great acting the fight scenes were welcomed.<br /><br />Special Effects: Taking the same great special effects applied to the series and uping things a knotch the visual eye candy is handled well, but neither does it detract or add too much to the movie. It was just the right balance to be functional, attractive and keep us focused on the story and characters.<br /><br />OVERALL: I was greatly impressed with this movie and will own it when it comes out in a few weeks. It stands alone as a great addition to any movie collection or a wonderful addition to anyone who already ownes the series. Watch it on the big screen if you still can then run out and buy it. You won't be disappointed.greatly impressed with this movie and will own it when it comes out in a few weeks.

B00003CX5P|1.0|<br />This blows -- just like all of the Star Wars movies. But nerds who live in their mom's basement will love it. Some people just can't handle this world...so they have to find succor in a phony world of make-believe, populated with goofy space creatures and dimwitted super heroes. Grow up already! There are no super hereos, Elroy.  <br /> <br />But if you have a light saber in your hand and a Luke Skywalker outfit in your closet, slap this in your DVD player, grab some vaseline, and lube up for fantasy and adventure! <br />
B00099BPP6|3.0|Usually, I find myself in general agreement with the preceding reviewer, Armindo.  And I agree with much of what he says here about this recording of Verdi's \\"Rigoletto.\\"  However, when it comes to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as Rigoletto, I can only say with genuine admiration that Armindo is truly a more forgiving and saintly soul than I shall ever be.<br /><br />DF-D as Rigoletto?  Gimme a break!  The man was a freakin' disaster in Italian opera.  He was smart and he was a good--no, he was a great singer, so all his bad decisions about Italian roles were conscious ones, and thereby the worse for it.  His Falstaff all but gave me hives.  His Rigoletto is worse.  DF-D's smoothed out, self-consciously elegant, very Germanic vocal style and his over-intellectualized acting are the very antithesis of what Verdi requires.  Rigoletto the lieder singer?  No, thank you!<br /><br />Watching from a hilltop as the British Light Brigade rode gallantly and catastrophically toward its fate, a French general is supposed to have said (in French, of course), \\"It is magnificent, but it is not war.\\"  Of Fischer-Dieskau as Rigoletto, I say that it is very nice singing, but it is not Verdi.
0060578793|5.0|This book is by far and away the best survival manual I have seen. <br />From having a basic survival kit, through to survival in different climates and conditions, through to creating camps, tools and traps, it is a wealth of information. <br />With many illustrations, including colour illustrations of plants and wildlife from different regions, the book is accessible and easy to read. <br />Like the SAS themselves, there is much knowledge contained within this book that could applied to many different situations, and so it is a very enjoyable book to read, too. <br />With even a section on disaster management, both man-made and natural, this would have to stand as one of the most practical books that anyone could own for preparedness. <br />If you are a camper, a hiker or just a long-distance traveller or backpacker, it could also have a multitude of uses. <br />When it comes down to it, I think this book could easily make the difference to whether you live or die in a survival situation and it could give you a fighting chance when all hope seems lost. <br />
B0001BS4Q0|3.0|This is a solid album but after hearing the single I was expecting better. It's still great chillout music, very calm nice downtempo stuff that makes great background music. Definitely better than Zero 7's last album, which was awful, although it's not as good as the first Zero 7 album, which was awesome. Overall, Sia has a nice voice, but could use a little more passion and creativity to put her over the top from just good to great. Until then, she'll always be remembered as the girl from that Zero 7 song Distraction, and not as Sia, the solo artist.  <br /> <br />Also, if you like the single Breathe Me, search out the Four Tet remix, which may even be better than the original. <br /> <br />And I don't watch Six Feet Under.
B000AP04NI|2.0|What a disappointment this new re release of \\"Oklahoma\\" has turned out to be. Certainly the Cinemascope version on disc one is a much better quality print, and certainly, as already noted here, the Todd AO version is laughably poor....but neither versions are that great. In fact, the best, sharpest and purest version of this film exists on the old pan and scan video release, which has sparkling colors, clarity and definition lacking in both these versions. The one good thing about this release is the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (16.9) as opposed to the bad job this and other R &H musicals have suffered in the past. But why bother going to this trouble if Fox could find decent versions of the film. One miust add the narratives are lively and interesting, though the Todd AO/Shirley Jones version seems to bare very little relevance to what is going on, on the screen. There are shorts about the miracle of Todd AO on disc two, certainly a farce considering the appaling state of the Todd AO print---and one final question, why could not the makers set the featurette on the comparisons between Scope and AO in an anamorphic print , so it best illustrates the differences in the mediums.....One can only hope that, as \\"Carousel\\", \\"the King and I\\" and \\"Sth Pacific\\" get the double disc special edition treatment, that someone actually bothers to find a clean  restored version of these films.....Do Fox think the public are stupid? Or just blind?<br /><br />Les Solomon  -Sydney, Australia
B000023VR6|5.0|\\"Things just ain't the same for gangstas, times is changin' young niggaz is agin'\\"<br /><br />This is how Dre begins his highly anticipated Chronic 2001 album. This represents the more contemplative less KrayZeE AzZ GeE that Da Chronic brings. The Watcher serves as a fitting intro to the new Dre. He's still cool, still pretending to smoke a lot of weed, but he's thinking more now.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I was buying the new Dre when I first got 2001. Of course, I had to love it regardless if it was Dre rapping over a Xylophone. (cough, No Limit, cough, cough). Dre isn't the kind of rapper who is highly political or that you think you really want to get too far past G Thang with. He takes a lot risks on 2001, and most of them pay big dividends.<br /><br />That said, \\"Still DRE\\" really is the best song on the album. It creates the same magical feelings that \\"Let Me Ride\\", \\"G Thang\\", and Dre Day did and do. It makes you bob your head and feel Dre. It's such a relief! Whatever has happened in 10 years, he's still Dre. When I heard this song on MTV before the album was released I almost broke down and cried. It's so well done and perfect. It's Dre circa 1991. It's so not Jay-Z and Nas. He's representin' for the gangstas all across the world - flat out.<br /><br />The next time the album hits rare air is \\"What's the Difference\\". There are good songs in between but this is the next time Dre strikes gold, or should I say platinum. Dre gives a nod to the classic Renzo in a Benzo line and the song just takes off from there, Dre is real, Em is crazy, and X to the Z is hard core. It's a great blend with a nice edge and a somewhat ridiculous beat.<br /><br />\\"Forgot About Dre\\" is good, but not one of my favorites. \\"The Nest Episode\\" completes the cycle of top shelf songs. Wow, it truly is the next episode. Dre and Snoop put on a clinic and it is a beautiful experience. My only complaint is that it's too short. We need another verse here. I won't dwell on it, because the song is as good as rap music gets. Also, I have to give the nod to Nate Dogg here. Any rap song can be improved with a dash of Nate Dogg.<br /><br />The second half of the CD is somewhat unremarkable. Dre gives just about everyone on the Aftermath label a test drive. I like some of the stuff, but most times you're better off to just listen to the first half twice. This is why I give this revolutionary album an 8. Dre can do better than the second half of this album and we all know it. I like \\"Some LA Niggaz\\" and \\"Murder Ink\\" but they can't hide the fact that the second half is a lot of filler.<br /><br />Overall, the second real Dre album is a rousing success. It has a lot of good songs, and a few GREAT songs. Dre has mellowed, and this isn't as good as the original, but it's sinfully close. He truly is Still the Dre we all know and love.se the song is as good as rap music gets. Also, I have to give the nod to Nate Dogg here.

0060934700|5.0|And my daughter says...<br /><br />\\"This book, recommended to me by the same friend who got me hooked on The Sandman comics, went far beyond my expectations. Typically, as masterful as a novelist can be, their short stories often fall short. Not so with this collection. Gaiman combines fantasy and horror to bring to life characters that typically find themselves in unbelievable situations. However, Gaiman's fantastic writing makes these events seem normal, everyday occurrences.  In particular, I would recommend the retelling of Snow White and the Wedding Story.<br /><br />In addition to the short fiction, Gaiman also includes some of his poetry. Ranging from scenes of lonely vampires to a computer game that takes over unknowing minds, all of the poetry is engaging and will absorb your attention for quite some time after you have put down the book.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this collection for anyone who enjoys fantasy, horror, and good writing. And now, I think I will go reread the book for the fourth time...\\"
B000002B1M|4.0|While I couldn't approve less of Nas using the title \\"The Message\\" without giving props the songs is admittedly good. Sometimes Nas loses me on the lyrics, but generally it is a good song with a strong message. The beat also makes the song. It goes so well with what is being said and gives the song an emotional and powerful feel. The beat demands the attention of listener without detracting from the focus of what is being done: the lyrics. Also, conspicuous is the \\"I ain't the type of brother for you to be testin'\\" line. Why? Because Nas uses brother instead of what most rappers would use: 'Nigga'. While there is no shortage of the n word in Nas' raps, I just like the replacement here, it's positive.<br /><br />\\"Street Dreams\\" is another favorite, but is really made by the beat and the chorus. I really wait for the chorus, because it's really strong. The chorus is shocking, but also mixes in words like 'destiny'. Hearing a word like that in rap music is surprising and when it is used well (as it is here) it makes it all the better. Nas' vocabulary really adds to a lot of his songs, and this is no exception.<br /><br />While there are a couple more good songs on It Was Written, (\\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Shootouts\\") generally most of it comes up average. There is a long lull in between \\"Street Dreams\\" and \\"If I Ruled the World\\". A lot of very average to poor Nas work seperates these great tracks. What I mean is that when Nas isn't captivating, he's boring and clumsy as hell. There are times when Nas seems destined for greatness, and other times when you wonder how he got a record deal at all.<br /><br />A problem I have with Nas is that he is not original. While this subject has beeen ahrped upon by countless critics I am not going to criticize his beat recycling, or his remake of \\"Sweet Dreams\\". The problem I have is when I hear some songs I get the distinct feeling they were inspired directly by earlier work of other rappers. For instance, \\"Black Girl Lost\\" seems to be a direct take off of 2Pac's \\"Baby Don't Cry\\". Also, while I recognize that Nas is a contemporary of the Wu - his East coast lingo flat out reeks of the clan. The 'word is bond' line has basically been unoffically copyrighted by the clan, and it seems really off to have someone else (who indeed sound sismilar) saying it all the time.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a grand mixture Nas-icity. You get it all here. There are some really high moments, and a long lull before you get that last on with track 15. I don't hate all the work that Nas does, but some of it needs to be cleaned up quite a bit. After the first two tracks of It Was Written I was ready to deem this bad boy a classic, but it lost me not long after that. Nas can be good and he is here, but he is also mundane, boring, and unoriginal.ms to be a direct take off of 2Pac's \\"Baby Don't Cry\\". Also, while I recognize that Nas is a contemporary of the Wu - his East coast lingo flat out reeks of the clan. The 'word is bond' line has basically been unoffically copyrighted by the clan, and it seems really off to have someone else (who indeed sound sismilar) saying it all the time. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a grand mixture Nas-icity. You get it all here. There are some really high moments, and a long lull before you get that last on with track 15.

0767827791|1.0|some folks report having a double sided version of this with full screen pan and scan (cinematography abortion) on one and the full gorgeous cinemascope version on the other....well the version  I just received is FULL SCREEN  only...and one sided... <br />of course its insult to injury that the program starts 2:35 widescreen while they run the credits (don't want to cut those folks names off) but as soon as the directors name runs..BAM..full screen ...and its horrible...grainy garbage.  <br />James Wong Howe...the adored cinematographer who filmed this obviousl composed for the full wide screen as the pan and scan is worse than normal with way too much information missing. <br />honestly...when will  the studios  learn? I guess they figure only  elderly ladies like my mother ..who still have a burning hotteee for William Holden will  want this and they are tired of explaining the BLACK BARS to them?  for the rest of us...ARGGGGGGHHHH
B000005Z0E|4.0|In 2Pacalypse now we get a glimpse at a rapper who in the years to come would change the rap world with his epic roller coaster of a career. He would become know by many as the greatest rapper ever. While this is always in debate few can find reason why he should be considered any less than one of the greatest. No doubt 2 Pac is emotional, but he starts his tragic career with a more conciseness message. 2Pacalypse Now is raw and powerful, and glimmers with the depth that 2 Pac possesses.<br /><br />2 Pac was aiming at something much more grander than what he accomplished in his later albums. He addresses his life as he has lived it, a day-to-day struggle. He spins the trials and tribulations of his life into vivid story lines. He addresses very pertinent issues pertaining to the black race, with his main focus being directed towards the unwarranted targeting of black males by the police. 2 Pac doesn't lash out with unbridled anger, as he seems to do when he was under the death row persuasion. Instead he tells his stories in a calm and intelligent manner, one in which he clearly makes an effort to make the raps understandable. There is absolutely no bling bling in this album, its all real, and 2 Pac doesn't glorify the streets instead he tries to uplift them. 2 Pac's social conscience comes off as genuine and he does it without an excess of violent undertones.<br /><br />2 Pac definitely tries to become a uniting force for young black youths, especially for those who struggled on the streets. Tracks like \\"Words of Wisdom\\", and \\"Violent\\" are powerful Public Enemy esque songs, blunt and meaningful. His skill for storytelling comes out all over this album, in tracks like \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\", \\"Pat Time Mutha\\", and \\"Soulja's Story\\" tell about tragedy, and ghetto desperation with terrific word play by 2Pac. Few tracks could qualify as party songs, which I applaud. 2 Pac's theme is real and not influenced by the record industry. Something that I believe severely affected his later albums.<br /><br />Unfortunately social relevance doesn't sell 15 millions records. This album also lacks a strong radio worthy hit. The music on this album is rough around the edges and lacks experience. But it has a lot of great moments. 2 Pac himself is noticeably young. His style is very unpolished and sounds a bit like beat oriented party rap. Even though this was 1992 he does kind of sound like a stereotypical 80's rapper. But as we all know his style expands marvelously in years to come. Even on this album he does show signs of range. He raps in a very slow and punctual manner but does have tracks where he raps very quickly mixing some of his rhymes much more closely. 2 Pac's powerful presence on the mic is noticeably missing, but this is mostly due to his inexperience.<br /><br />The sound of this album reminds me a lot of Ice Cube circa 1990. His beats are obviously west coast, but do have some recognizable New York influences. His beats are not overly deep and banging. And they lack a bit of creativity. But they are perfect for the time period. His beats are heavy on simple drumbeats and looping synthesizers. I must be honest I'm not blown away by any of the beats on this CD, at least not as much as some of his later tracks where they can literally send chills down your spine. They do suffice and at least show his hard edge but emotional approach to story telling in an upbeat while not overly violent way.<br /><br />I can definite feel what 2 Pac is tying to do here, even though I'm not overly impressed with the actual music the lyrical aspects are astounding and well worth the listen. This CD doesn't really break much new ground and is sonically inferior to many other CDs out there then and now. It acts better as a prologue to his later efforts and a terrific beginning to a dramatic career. Its strength lies solely on 2 Pac's ambassador to the streets storytelling.e severely affected his later albums. <br /> <br />Unfortunately social relevance doesn't sell 15 millions records.

B000BJ7BCA|3.0|Admittedly, SKY HIGH, as many critics have noted is a blend of THE INCREDIBLES and HARRY POTTER, but it never reaches those heights.  Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston play superheroes who send their young son to Sky High, a school for super heroes suspended way up in the sky.  Of course, once there young Will (nicely played by Michael Angarano) meets up with the typical high school bullies and a seductive temptress played by Mary Elizabeth Winsted.  At first, young Will Stronghold doesn't seem to have any powers, so he's placed in the \\"sidekick\\" category until one day he discovers he has inherited both his father's strength and mother's ability to fly wherein he is made a \\"hero\\" and becomes an outcast to his old friends.  There are some nice bits by Bruce Campbell as Coach Sonic Boomer; Cloris Leachman as the doctor with x-ray vision; and Wonder Woman herself, Lynda Carter, as the school's principal who has the best line in the movie:  \\"Do they think I'm Wonder Woman?\\".  It's all innocuous fun and in its own way, fairly entertaining, with some nice 80s songs to boot.  But it's not a classic and will probably leave your memory within hours.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is the definitive compilation of east coast early rap music. This album certainly was a force behind the development of the genera and basically put Nas on the hip-hop map. No other album could have better jump started a career and a genera better than this album was able to. It is certain Nas has changed over time from his roots of this album and SJ just seem to like the new Nas better than the Nas we hear on this album. His opinion is just something that everyone is just going to learn to accept to disagree with. Here is what this album means to me. This album is in my top 5 albums, no other conditions, this album has it all.<br /><br />It has some of the best, truest, personal lyrics that are found in rap. There is something thing in his songs that so vividly paints a picture of what he is portraying. Lyrically there are very few albums that have top to bottom what this album has, there are very few low points in Nas' tracks. I not even a very big fan of lyrics in songs but Nas here still seems to more than what other have. Nas could be a poster child for defining the term 'street poet'. There is nothing to flashy, thugging or R&Bish in his songs. It seems to be only the real truth of things rather than a tainted picture of reality.<br /><br />His lyrics lead me into what I believe is Nas strongest trait, the man can strait up flow. No one goes from line to line, verse to verse as smoothly as he does. You can barely tell what lead into what because it all seems to fit so seamlessly together. Regardless of the topic or song Nas always lays things down for us with no gaps, stops or pauses. His breathing patterns always amaze me, how is he able to fit all it together with out pauses. This coupled with the lost art of limiting guest tracks truly displays Nas in his entirety.<br /><br />In terms of beat the album might be slightly dated and I would tend to think that just because of strengths in other areas the beats are the weakest part of this album. It is not that they are bad per se, but they don't seem to add to much to the album. In some cases I find it to be a detraction rather than a positive. I find \\"Halftime\\"'s beat to be incredibly annoying to the point where it actually almost ruins the song. I do think that for the most part the less is more theory that is found in this album fits Nas style perfectly. The infusion of jazz and pop music (MJ's) samples fit very well with Nas' style. It takes a back seat to his flow, as well it should.<br /><br />This album is a little on the short side, only having 10 tracks, but there is only one skit on the entire album. That has to be some kind of records for a rap album. Still what is on this album is all quality, nothing to flashy, just an incredible compilation of very good songs.<br /><br />Any rap fan needs this.um.

B000BDJ1BU|4.0|In an age of chart drivel and seemingly endless hip-hop and (yawn) R&B, it's good to see Enya back with a new album and this single release - which looked there for a minute as if it wouldn't come out at all (changing release date etc etc). <br />  <br />Most Enya fans are familiar with the song \\"Amarantine\\"...but what of the extra tracks? \\"The comb of the winds\\" is your bog standard, typical Enya instrumental but it is all the better for it, similar to \\"The Promise\\" and \\"Oriel window\\" (from previous singles releases) - I like it very much. \\"The Spaghetti Western Theme From The Celts\\" i'm not too sure about. It must be from an advert or something - it's way too short for a start and doesn't seem to get going or have a purpose. <br /> <br />Still, this is a welcome single release from someone who I have admired and followed for many a year. Most Enya fans will get this anyway for the extra tracks but I still recommend it for the un-converted... <br /> <br />...after all, there's got to be more to music nowadays than Hip hop and screeching girl groups, hasn't there...? <br /> <br />Regards. <br /> <br /> <br />
0920668372|5.0|This one of my favorite books of all time. I love how Munsch captures the essence of children at the particular ages that he shows. The comments about feeling like she lived in a zoo and wanting to sell her son to a zoo remind me of my own mother talking about my two younger brothers. I also like how intricate the pictures are. McGraw shows you the pattern on the wallpaper, the spilt glue on the bathroom floor, the animal design on the bedspread, the muddy footprints in the kitchen, the design on the coffee cups, and so manny more that it would take too long to name. This story is just as touching and meaningful to adults as to children.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|This box set is absolute garbage. never in the history of film-making has a series of films been butchered into the sprawling collective mess it now is.These trilogies should have been regarded as SEPEARATE projects the new and the old. Any and almost ALL dvd/star wars fans would have wanted to see the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL releases of these films perhaps cleaned up but not redone to the nightmare they are now. If you couldnt even be decent enough to your fan base to NOT wreck these films then I think you should have LEAST given them the option to purchases the UN-CGI releases of this particular trilogy. The reason these theatrical cuts will NEVER see the light of day is because lucas has cut,spliced,editied,them to death. He has gone too far to go back. Now all that is left is a sad man left with what once was the greatest films ever released.
0679809015|4.0|I ordered this book based on all its' glowing reviews. I was a little disappointed when it arrived though. It's very small... yes... good for throwing in your purse etc.. but the flaps inside are also very small. Too small for my 11 month old to use, and a little difficult to find. I'm still going to give it four stars. The illustrations are very colorful and fun. The location of the flaps with-in the pictures is very well done... it's just a shame they are so small. I'm sure my son will really enjoy this book in 5 months or so. <br />*** For a better young age appropriate lift the flap book, try \\"Hide and Seek Farm\\", by Grandreams books. This book is a little bigger, but the card board flaps are huge, and the illustrations simple and colorful. My sons loves this series! (Hide and seek Ocean, Forest, Farm, Pets, Jungle, and Polar)
B000BJS4SU|4.0|First dont think of a standard JM album, he is not who we think he was, this is the work of 3 tight musicians. Other than Gravity this album is definately solid. Your not gunna love it the first time you listen to it, but give it time and you will be hooked. I recommend skipping the first track and saving it till last if you were a John Mayer fan before, its extremely different. The work of jordan and palladino are amazing, as expected, and should not be overlooked in the listening of this album. Mayer's playing in the hendrix cover, wait until tomorrow, is extremly tight esp for a live preformance. The Ray Charles cover is a unique touch, but definately added flavor. Any true lover of music will appreciate this album.
B00000255F|5.0|Back in 1975, I was paying for my college tuition working as a night watchman in the offices underneath the Queensboro Bridge in Manhattan. The engineer's office had a big bay window and a great sounding tube radio that would glow orange in the dark. I spent most of my time at a desk in an adjoining office, studying with a desk light, when one night, I heard this lonely trumpet from far away in no man's land start playing. I put my book down and listened. I had on a rock station, the best (WNEW-FM), but this wasn't rock. But it was something I understood. I got up and walked into the engineer's  office. The blinds were opened,  a light (from a streetlamp, or a full moon, I don't remember) filled the office with slashes of light, just like in the movies. I stared at the radio, mesmerized, by this sound and this story of two losers, way out of their depths, trying to make a score with some pretty no-nonsense type guys and all through the song that trumpet played, way out in the distance, all the way in the back of the record. It seemed to represent their dreams--visable, but somehow, always, just out of reach.  When the song ended, I kept standing there in the dark, looking at the radio. I felt like I heard something I never heard before. WHAT WAS THAT? WHO was that??!! Who would have the balls to put out somthing so uncommon, so true to life, yet so different that despite it's perfect execution, was sure to go over everyone's head? I felt in that dark room, the song was made just for me. The great Allison Steele, The Nightbird finally came on announcing that was \\"Meeting Across The River\\" by Bruce Springsteen. That was my introduction to Springsteen's music. I went out and bought BORN TO RUN the next day and was astounded. The rock n roll that was on there told me that this guy knew and remembered who Phil Spector was. It was the sound that was in my heart since I first heard \\"Be My Baby\\" when I was a kid. But these weren't puppy-love songs from a musical era criminally forgotten, but fear-fueled dreams of winning or losing or escape from whatever dead end street that resides at the bottom of life. The cry that ends \\"Backstreets\\" or the absolute HOWL that closes \\"Jungleland\\", still rattles my soul and like \\"Meeting...\\", still makes me wonder, \\"You can put that on a record\\"?lly forgotten, but fear-fueled dreams of winning or losing or escape from whatever dead end street that resides at the bottom of life. The cry that ends \\"Backstreets\\" or the absolute HOWL that closes \\"Jungleland\\", still rattles my soul and like \\"Meeting...\\", still makes me wonder, \\"You can put that on a record\\"?
0060899190|5.0|This moving book, a compilation of never-before-revealed secrets written on one side of a postcard and sent anonymously to the website PostSecret, will touch you.  Some secrets are dark, some so personal you feel an intruder for reading them, some caustic, some comical. The artwork that accompanies each message is remarkable: shocking in its originality and its effect.  I had been a fan of the site and wondered if owning the book were really necessary.  Would it turn into a Coffee Table Book (ugh)?  The answer is no.  In the same way that holding something you read is more satisfying than looking at it on screen, this book delivers. I read it the minute it arrived and I continue to be drawn back to it. I open it randomly, and am moved all over again by a stranger's baring of the soul.   <br /> <br />It is a powerful piece. Buy it for yourself.  And then buy it as a gift.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira has outdone herself this year.  I really appreciate the hardwork that she put into both the DualDisc and the new release.  I think she did well on track 1 as it was worth the risk.  I wasn't too thrilled at first with the English versions of Track 5 and Track 1 off the first one.  When I played them a couple of times and realized that maybe Track 5 when translated into English has a flavor of it's own.  When Track 1 when translated into English into \\"Something\\" doesn't catch my ear as much as the Spanish verison.  \\"Something\\" is missing something but I can't put my finger on it.  Otherwise, this disc is worthwhile addition to your music collection.  I have both Vol.1 (DualDisc format) and Vol.2.  I enjoy both equally and am glad to have both.  Although I wanted Vol.2 in the DualDisc format...I was equally pleased to be able to play it back on my discman right out of the jewel case when I immediately purchased it for myself.  I was most pleased to have a new disc about 10 days after my birthday and before Christmas.  I have a few favorites: \\"How do You Do,\\" \\"Animal City,\\" \\"Don't Bother,\\" and \\"Timor.\\"   \\"Illegal\\" is good and it's nice to hear Carlos Santana playing in the background.

B000BUYP4Q|3.0|After years of not having a Batman film and mostly due to the franchise hitting bottom thanks to Joel Schumacher's disastrous \\"Batman forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\", Christopher  Nolan present us his version of the character with an impressive all star cast anda story brilliantly written by David S. Goyer.<br /><br />The film<br /><br />There were  high expectations for this film before its release as if would it be as good as Burton's films, the truth is, there are no points to compare, Nolan and Burton visions are quite different from each other, but both respect the origins and essence of who the character is.<br /><br />Goyer took some liberties in the storytelling that could be considered as unforgivable by many fans (Bruce's parents are originally killed after seeing \\"Mark of Zorro\\" at the movie theater, a fact that marks Bruce's mind with the idea of a masked vigilante) but also hints at stuff that the previous versions let pass unnoticed, the main focus of this film are the origins of Batman and his training to become what he ultimately is. Even though the detective part of Bruce's training is not even mentioned, the twist in which Ra's Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) is the one who trained him in the ninja arts and theatricality just makes their conflict more delightful and interesting. Cameos and appearances of characters from the comic book are also well used, justified and important to the story (Carmine Falcone and killer Zsaz)<br /><br />The story uses the two villains exactly as they would act in the comic book, Ra's Al Ghul with his constant desire to set thing right his way and Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) working and experimenting with the thing he enjoys the most: fear. Even though the Scarecrow is totally the opposite of the comic book (in the comic Jonathan Crane is an old and ugly doctor who was fired from Gotham University for experimenting on the students with his gas of fear), the character presented keeps the essence and motives that the original character has, unlike the Riddler, Mr Freeze, Two Face or Poison Ivy in Schumacher's awful versions.<br /><br />A new Gotham city is presented, much more like a NY city style, a new Batmobile (not as fancy as the previous ones but quite impressive) and a whole set of characters we expect to see in future releases, James Gordon (Gary Oldman who amazingly looks exactly as Jim in the comic), Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Jonathan Crane, Carmine Falcone and Ra's Al Ghul.<br /><br />Masterfully executed by the whole cast and brilliantly directed by Nolan, there are many of us looking forward for a sequel to this film.<br /><br />The extras<br /><br />Disc one contains Mtv's \\"Tankman Begins\\", a spoof we could have lived without but without any doubt a collector's piece for all Mtv fans.<br /><br />Disc two contains a set of documentaries related to all aspects of production and shooting of the film, from the early beginnings in Nolan's washing room until the shooting of some of the most difficult sequences of the film. The disc 2 is organized in a comic book-like format which makes it a little difficult to follow as many things are like hidden, but if you go until the end of the short and pointless story, you will find a list with all documentaries available. One of the documentaries called \\"Genesis of the bat\\" presents comic book artist related to Batman talking about the character and film, from Dennis O'Neil to Jim Lee. I am sure this will be a piece fans of the comic book will enjoy. All extras are worthy of watching and I strongly recommend the 2 disc set, it is a 5 o 6 dollar difference that will compensate with all the facts and items found in the bonus materials.<br /><br />***BluRay review***<br /><br />I had already written a review for this film when the two-disc special edition was released on DVD, so I will not get into any details about how great the movie is.<br /><br />The treatment they gave to this release is incredible, image looks great and colors are stunning, the high definition definitely makes a difference and 'Batman Begins' looks better than ever (simply check out the ice sequence between Bruce and Ducard)<br /><br />I have seen threads with questions as to what exactly does the limited edition set contains versus the regular single disc, so here are what I think are the most important ones:<br /><br />The Disc<br /><br />The disc included here is the same disc they released separately:<br />* All the extras from the 2-disc DVD are included, the documentaries and the awful 'Tankman Begins'<br />* The prologue to 'The Dark Knight' in high definition (are we in for a treat when released on Bluray!)

B000B7BRMM|3.0|I am also a big Diana Krall fan, but was disappointed with her Christmas CD. The arrangements are okay as is the band, but I just feel like Diana's voice is a bit flat on this one...it just sounds like she is a bit lazy and hasn't really put her heart into it. A little too much emphasis on trying to be jazzy than \\"Christmassy\\". This CD will not put me in the mood. You might say that I'm a bit more \\"traditional\\" when it comes to Christmas CD's however at the very least, I need a clear, clean, and beautiful voice to go along with the most beutiful music of the year. Diana just seems like she's hiding her voice, prefering a scat lick to a \\"pure\\" note. I think this one will go into the drawer....maybe I'll break it out and try again, but I doubt it will work for me. Just doesn't sound like Christmas music. (And what's with that pose on the cover?!!)    By the way, Russ Freeman's \\"Holiday\\" is excellent!!!    P Mac
B00006SKW7|5.0|I had the good fortune to pick up a copy of this production from the UK, and I certainly hope it becomes available in the US for the sake of fans of Jacques Offenbach and Natalie Dessay. <br /> <br />For those not familiar with the story, it's a burlesque of the Orpheus & Eurydice legend--he's a skirt chasing narcissist, she's a slut, and the gods are even worse.  This is not Gounod or Massenet, but operetta at its best. <br /> <br />Even at this early point in her career, Natalie Dessay is the consummate singing actress, and she proves herself a deft comedienne, too.  Not belle but tres joli, this diva in the making is the best of an excellent French ensemble, and it's easy to believe that all the men want a piece of her. <br /> <br />This is truly an ensemble piece, and it's hard to single anyone out (bravi!).  The balance between singing and acting is nearly perfect, moving effortlessly from spoken dialogue to sparkling arias and some fine dance numbers; no single element overwhelms the others.  By sticking to the story, farce though it is, the production is an immensely funny piece of theatre.  The scathing social commentary (implied, not preached) is as current as it was 150 years ago.  A few other standouts: <br /> <br />Yann Beuron's Orpheus is marvelous.  Only in the first act is Orpheus a significant character and his duets with Eurydice and L'Opinion Publique are well choreographed and genuinely funny.  He actually manages to make the vain, jealous musician sympathetic.   <br /> <br />Laurent Naouri proves as deft a comic as his wife (Dessay), and with Jean-Paul Fouchecourt carries the action from the second scene onward.  The fly duet especially combines some virtuoso singing with a bawdy, comic love scene. <br /> <br />Among the minor gods, Etienne Lescroart's Mercury singing his aria in a chorus line with the dancers is a highlight, and Cassandre Berthon's Cupid is so charming that you forget she's singing a male role. <br /> <br />Is there anything wanting?  I didn't think so, but the performance was originally shot for television and seems a bit dark at times.  Some will be put off by the modern albeit somewhat surreal sets and costumes or the fact that all the dancers (men and women) wear female costumes.  That's their loss
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is really good, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who has not played the game.You'll have trouble following if you didn't play through the game. The graphics in this movie are absolutly beautiful. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! The story is really good, but I had a little trouble following it the first time I watched it cause I had to watch it with subtitles and they did a bad job translating from Japenese to English. Some of it didn't make since because the subtitles were way off track. But, other then that, excellent movie. A nice piece to add to the FFVII compilation. I read in some of the other reviews that they didn't understand why monsters would just appear from out of no where. Well, in the FF world, the heros and the villians have the power to summon creatures whenever they want to. Thats why they just appeared......Buy this movie if your a fan, its really good.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's memoir, A Million Little Pieces, tells the gripping story of a 23 year-old addict steps away from death who is checked into a treatment facility in Minnesota. Frey tells the story of experiences in rehab with such brutal honesty that at some points it is painful for the reader. He forces the reader to get inside of his drug-damaged head when he describes mad hallucinations that haunted him when he first checked in. He describes one in gruesome detail, \\"The bugs crawl onto my skin and they start biting me and I try to kill them. I claw at my skin, tear at my hair, start biting myself. I don't have any teeth  and I'm biting myself and there are shadows and bright lights and flashes and screams and bugs bugs bugs. I am lost.\\" With remarkable honesty, Frey leaves nothing out. He recounts dreams of downing bottles of booze, smoking lethal amounts of crack, sniffing industrial glue and cans of gasoline, all ending with murderous rage and suicidal thoughts. He shares his true feelings towards his parents, the \\"Fury\\" that rises inside of him at the thought of being near them. He doesn't lie about attending the daily lectures and never listening to them. Frey thinks that they're pointless and he is not afraid to share that opinion. Nothing in this memoir is censored. <br />I found that not only what Frey described was powerful and intense, but also how he described it. Short, choppy sentences mixed in with long, detailed ones constructed with little regard for correct punctuation made the descriptions seem as if they were still racing through Frey's head. Because of lack of punctuation, there can often be some confusion distinguishing between Frey's internal thoughts and spoken dialogue, but that has a minimal effect on the story as a whole. <br />Overall, this book is a page-turner; there is no downtime between scenes. Frey tells the story of his road to recovery with such unimaginable honesty, it may blow some readers away. <br />
B0000020C4|5.0|Listening to this CD and more so watching the DVD I became involved with ever aspect of the production.  The diction of the Chorus is astounding. Understanding words from a chorus of 150?  unheard of!  Until 1195 in Royal Albert Hall. <br /> <br />I have performed ON-Broadway, Las VEgas, Toured with Elvis, all as a Percussionist....the aspect of'capturing' an audience is rare indeed even for Stars....but when it happens....time stands still.  There is only now.  Forever resides in the moment.  This is what Les Mis....did for me.  The concentration...the focus...the attention to each performer....the lighting, camera work [DVD] <br /> <br />When heaven visits a 'Show'...one could call it \\"10th Anniversary Concert at Royal Albert Hall in 1995. <br /> <br />I wish I knew even one person that was in the audience.  Just one.  I want to talk with that person.  There are historic Stage performances that people talk about forever.  i.e. Judy Garland in 1962 sitting on the stage and the croud was in her hand.  Victoria De Los Angeles in Recital in 1977 in St. Paul MN.  YOu have them yourself my musical friends.  You can still feel them now as I do.  I so wish we could share these moments together. <br /> <br />Memories are eternal....events that ignite these memories need to be shared....somehow.  Let's do it....let's try.  Feelings need to be expressed.  How about now.  Internet?  Let's give it a go. <br /> <br />John-Hans Melcher  jhmelcher at gmail dot  com  [get it?] <br /> <br />Tell me your eternal events...I'm a listening ear.

As a long time mariah fan i am actually very happy for her now that she has made a triumphant comeback and in actuality the re-release of this cd wasn't totally in vain because i did not buy the original and with this re-release i was able to purchase this cd.  Also, the track \\"dont forget about us\\" makes up for the entire price of the cd, classic mariah.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Well it was kind of disappointing when I found out that John Williams wasn't composing the score for the film, but Patrick Doyle did do a pretty good job!  It isn't really the typical \\"Harry Potter\\" score.  I didn't find this as magical as the other three were, but this one is full of energy!  And I don't really know what's with the last three tracks...  But the good outdoes the bad!  So all in all it's a great CD, and it's really worth buying!!
1590581814|2.0|Lots of people have been raving about this book; I read it, and I have to say I don't see what they love so much about it.  The writing is distracting -- though Sallis dedicates the book to Ed McBain, Donald Westlake, and Lawrence Block, what those three men have that Sallis does not is the ability to write with enormous clarity.  Their prose is irresistible in part because it's transparent -- it never needlessly calls attention to itself.  Sallis' prose, by contrast, seems always to be jumping up and down saying, \\"Look at me!  Aren't I precious?\\"  Apart from being pretentious and distancing the reader from the events of the story, it doesn't fit the characters -- Driver would not know the word \\"demotic\\" any more than he knew \\"desuetude.\\"  And while I love Borges, it's not the case that every book is better if its characters make some reference to him -- whenever I see a writer namecheck Borges, I want to reenact the scene from \\"Annie Hall\\" where an exasperated Woody Allen silences a blowhard by forcing him to face the person about whose work he is pontificating... <br /> <br />My reaction appears to be atypical, so readers of this review should take it with a grain of salt -- but I feel someone has to call \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" on this one...
B00000634J|5.0|John Lennon was the founder of the greatest pop/rock group that ever walked the earth, The Beatles. He was also a genuine personality with a charisma that was irresistable, a wit that was heartfelt, and an outspoken nature that influenced a generation. Lennon's music is the main topic on Lennon Legend, but one cannot mention Lennon's songs without bringing up all of the above.     Songs like Imagine, Power To The People, Mind Games, and the powerful handraiser Instant Karma! are just a few of Lennon the revolutionary's signature songs that called for the rights and unity of the common man. Mother, Cold Turkey, and Jealous Guy, on the other hand, reveal Lennon the man and his vulnerability, the songs deal with his inner pains of losing his mother, kicking the habit, and hurting the ones he loved. Then, there's the side of Lennon the lover and his devotion to Yoko with songs like the mesmerizing Woman, which stands as one of the best love songs ever written, No.9 Dream, and the Ben E King cover of Stand By Me from his 1975 covers album Rock N Roll.     The album also includes the Dylanesque Working Class Hero, the epical Happy Xmas (War Is Over), the sweet lullaby Beautiful Boy (written for young Sean Lennon), and the posthumous Nobody Told Me (the best social commentary song of the early 1980's).    With the compilation released and many others before and after, Lennon's legend has and always will carry on.    Recommended    A
0679422714|4.0|I grew up during the cultural revolution.  My parents went through the cultural revolution and were university teachers at the time.  I can tell you that at least the cultural revolution is presented accurately in the book.  Some people have criticized about the book being biased and untruly, but what was written about the cultural revolution at least I can say is very true.  It brings back so many memories, all sounds so familiar.  Mao sympathizers are the few who were not persecuted at that crazy time.
B00005JOGU|5.0|MOVIE: The film's opening scene is Truman Capote at a party, and he is standing with a drink in his hand while telling a story. Everyone standing around him is laughing and he is there almost performing a show for them. Here is where we have a first glimpse of the eccentric character of Truman Capote. Capote (pronounced 'cah-poh-tee') is brilliant film that takes an inside look at two different men. Here we have Truman Capote (Phillip Seymore Hoffman) who is a man who is absolutly full of himself. He loves to hear himself talk, and he loves it when people compliment his writing. Why shouldn't he love it, his work is incredibly brilliant. He is searchinh for the topic of his next article, and he picks a murder that happened in rural Kansas. Four people were murdered when two men broke and entered their homes. Truman travels by train to the small town along with Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to interview people who were assosiated with the murder. The two brothers accused of the murders are put to death, and Truman befriends one of them. He visits him in his cell and talks with him about who he is as a person. Capote decides that he wants to write a book instead of an article when he sees how interesting his subject is. They share stories about their pasts and how both of them seem to be outcasts of society. However, this is where the murderer, Perry Smith, actually finds a friend in Truman. Truman on the other hand is only after information that will make is book a masterpiece. As time goes by Truman starts to find decency within this man, and actually tries to fight for him so that his death sentence is appealed. After three years Truman's book is almost finished, but he still has no idea why the murders happened. When he finally probes the information out of Perry a whole new side of this man is revealed. The film is psychologically haunting. We have Truman Capote, a very eccentric yet brilliant homosexual writer. We also have Perry Smith, the murderer who seems to be a decent person and claims that they never meant to kill that family. The film digs deep on Truman's character, and just enough for Perry's. When the end comes and we learn the truth about the murders, we see a change in both characters. The film also boasts some very subtle yet amazing cinematography. Almost every shot is framed through a window or a doorway. In the jail we have some shots framed through the bars. The film also has some amazing lighting, and the lighting on the faces is another subtlety to notice. The haunting score by Mychael Danna is amazing. The score is nothing more than simple notes on the piano, very similar to Newman's score for Road To Perdition. The film is a deep and dark look into the human mind, and human emotion. I have read some reviews that suggest that there may have been a sexual attraction between Capote and Smith, but I did not see that at all. I felt it was just an interest in a person who is deemed a monster yet is a very poignant person. The film was brilliant and haunting, and is worth your while.<br /><br />ACTING: Phillip Seymore Hoffman gives a tour de force performance of Truman Capote. Not only did he capture the pompous nature of the writer, but he captured the emotion within him as a human being. Clifton Collins Jr. gives an amazing performance as the very ambiguous Perry Smith. The two actors also play off each other very well, their acting envelopes the audience into the atmosphere of the film and makes their conversations all the more emotional. Both actors are worthy of nominations, and Hoffman may have given a performance that translates into Oscar.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: While some people may find the first quarter of the film slow, it picks up and ends up being one of those movies that stays with you long after you see it. The performances are stellar, and they add to the film's effect on the audience. Bennet Miller's direction is on the mark as he spends the right amount of time with each character, and hesets up the third act of the film perfectlyd he sets up the third act of the film perfectly
0060899190|4.0|I've been visiting the postsecret website for quite some time-eager to see the new posts every Monday morning. When I heard about the book I quickly ordered it. I read it in one sitting and plan on keeping it on my bookshelf to share with others. I'm all for coming out with a book on this subject - if the sale of the book keeps the website up and running (and pays for Frank Warren's time) then by all means, keep publishing the books! One note for the future, as others have said, it would be best to redesign the layout to not cut through the gutter of the book - and to also keep the postcards to scale.<br /><br />I think the concept is original and being someone who has sent in secrets herself, I think it could be helping a lot of people in a theraputic way to share their secrets. Also, I'm so impressed with the general public's creativity in expressing their happiness, grief, depression and guarded thoughts in such a small format. Truly intriguing... this book is worth every penny.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, you do NOT have to be an overreaching pseudo-intellectual to enjoy this album. Although it can indeed become a little \\"too\\" deep for some other people (who of course CAN be saved), by no means is this a flaw in the record's construction. <br /> <br />That's because in \\"Hail to the Thief\\", at least you'll be able to find that little layer of depth that you've been craving for after several years straight of \\"the current music business's\\" shameless, inane output. And honestly, if you don't like this album then you need to broaden your musical horizons pronto. <br /> <br />What I find interesting in the album is its motif. If the liner notes remind you of some creepy apocryphal manuscript, don't fret: it's all part of the fun, twisted experience. <br /> <br />Forget about the political issues that connected this album to the Bush-Kerry presidential election: that was so two years ago. <br /> <br />Let me enumerate a few very good reasons to buy this album: 2 + 2 = 5. Sail to the Moon. Go to Sleep. I Will. A Punchup at a Wedding. Scatterbrain. And my personal favorite \\"A Wolf At The Door\\", which is so haunting it's good.

0553801503|4.0|After a long wait, the 4th book in the Ice and Fire series has finally arrived; with mixed enthusiasm by some of the  reviewers.  I found this to be an enjoyable book with a few minor reservations...let me explain.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />One of the finest assets that this series (and has continued with this book)  has been the authors' great literary skills in story-telling, plotting and descriptive writing. It has all the ingredients for the type of fantasy I love, that being love, honor and devotion mixed  with a liberal dose of betrayal, lust, deceit and unspeakable cruelty. This series is second to none in having the characters \\" telling it like it is\\" and invoking a strong visceral reaction in its readers.<br /><br />There is an incredibly detailed list of ALL the characters (Houses, families and individuals) in these novels, at the end of this book: reading this makes you appreciate just how much effort has gone into making this monumental series.<br /><br />The cons:(listed from minor to more important)<br /><br />1.)The maps and geographic locations:<br /><br />I found a significant portion of this book took place in locales that I could not  find on the maps provided,  such sites as \\"Duskendale\\", \\"Maidenpool\\", and \\"Braavos\\" for instance. The same can be said of some of the waterways. For example, I could not figure out where Brienne was until near the end of her story. The strange thing is, that the map is very detailed with many names and  places that were never involved with the story at all.<br /><br />2.)Dragged out, uneventful sections:<br /><br />There were two characters whose tale seemed somewhat redundant in the telling; that being Samwise and Arya (and to some degree the tale of Sansa Stark). In fact, it got to the point were I had trouble holding my interest in these sections and started skimming the chapters concerned, just to get through them.<br /><br />3.)Lack of my favorite characters:<br /><br />I must admit I sorely missed  Tyrion and Jon Snow in this novel. (although keeping up to date with Cercei and Jaime was enjoyed, and in fact, their stories really held this book together)<br /><br />All in all, not the best book in the series, but it is a good  book.  Let's hope Mr. Martin was just  taking a breather before delivering us with the next installment.I sorely missed  Tyrion and Jon Snow in this novel.

B0009S4IHY|4.0|From the same crew that brought you SHAOLIN SOCCER comes a tale of bitter gang warfare...with outlandish kung-fu anticts.  At times serious and at most crazy hijinks, Kung Fu Hustle is perfect for any action/martial arts/comedy/gangster/hong-kong movie afficiado.  Basic storyline is this: two bums off the streets are trying to join the most ruthless gang in the city, The Axe Gane, by showing everyone how tough they are...by posing as members of the gang.  When they try to push their weight around a dingy appartment complex they accidently spark a war between the Axe Gang and the certain members of the appartment community who are secretly legendary kung fu masters.  Needless to say, when the kicks and axes start flying the body count rises faster than a pinball machine score (which by the way is the sound effect for when the bad guys go flying and crashing into everything).<br /><br />An excellent film.  Fans of Shaolin Soccer will not be disappointed.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|As he proves again and again, Tim Burton is one of the more idiosyncratic filmmakers around, directing movies that alternate between remarkable and exasperating. Even with the shadow imposed by the 1971 version with Gene Wilder, Roald Dahl's classic children's story turns out to be the ideal vehicle for Burton's singular talents. Casting his muse, Johnny Depp, as the reclusive, pixilated Willy Wonka turns out to be a masterstroke as Depp is among the most audacious of screen actors constantly upending our expectations on how he plays his roles. Pitching his character as a rather perturbed cross between Mister Rogers and Pee Wee Herman (though the parallels with Michael Jackson are self-evident from the get-go), Depp is far from endearing as he is deliberately disconnected from any reality so he can focus solely on his own childish delights. At the same time, his hubris is what ironically makes him sympathetic as his insulated upbringing has allowed his innate brilliance to give rise to an elaborate confectionary factory.<br /><br />Skillfully adapted by John August, Dahl's tale focuses on a poor, good-hearted boy named Charlie, who lives with his close-knit family in a squalid cottage in a permanent leaning position. The home is just a stone's throw away from Wonka's factory. Wonka decides one day to hold a worldwide contest in which five children will win a guided tour of his factory hidden from the prying eyes of the public all these years. The children are chosen by way of golden tickets hidden in five Wonka chocolate bars, and of course, after much struggle, Charlie is one of the lucky five. Except for Charlie, each child turns out to be a brat, and their accompanying guardians show the reason why. The terrorizing children are gluttonous Augustus Gloop; spoiled Veruca Salt; ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde; and condescending techno-geek Mike Teavee. Wonka's guided tour is the highlight of the film replete with elaborate sets by Alex McDowell, dazzling cinematography by Philippe Rousselot and what looks to be an army of artists and technicians who have created this wildly imaginative world with a unique sense of panache. Special mention needs to go to Deep Roy, who thanks to digital magic, synchronistically plays all 165 Oompa-Loompas, a herculean effort if ever there was one in film acting.<br /><br />The overdubbed voice of Danny Elfman provides the Oompa-Loompas' vocalizing during the elephantine production numbers, and his genre-spanning music is a total kick. Elfman mimics various pop music styles to define the fates of the selfish children, from the blaring Earth, Wind and Fire-type horns for Violet to the Beach Boys harmonies for Veruca to the Queen overlays for Mike. As skillful as Depp is, Freddie Highmore - reunited with Depp more fruitfully than last year's \\"Finding Neverland\\" - provides the emotional focal point of the story with quiet conviction. The story takes a bit of a Freudian leap with the introduction of Wonka's father to explain Willy's oddly alienating behavior, but it all works within the context of the eccentric characters. This one is a genuine delight if not what most would expect from a children's film. The DVD is chock-full of extras with eight different featurettes highlighting various aspects of the production from Elfman's music to Roy's laborious transformation into the Oompa-Loompas, though my favorite is \\"The Attack of the Squirrels\\" which follows an army of squirrels through nut-cracking boot camp. Surprisingly, there is no alternate audio commentary track included.by Philippe Rousselot and what looks to be an army of artists and technicians who have created this wildly imaginative world with a unique sense of panache.

B000001DTM|5.0|It's alright, it's alright ... man that's a great song!   Probably the best on the whole album. But that does not mean to say the others aren't good, oh no, no, no. Starting off with Zoo Station, a hard rocker, it seems for a moment this will be the same U2 we all know and love. Ha! No, not for long.  The album then switches into tough electro rhythms, and club beats, mixed of course with all the unique delicacies of a U2 album - The Edge's ringing guitar, Adam Clayton's low slow bass line, Larry Mullen keeping everyone in time, and of course, Bono's individual voice ringing free above all of them.  <br /> <br />The highlight's include the, I feel overrated, but still deeply touching 'One', the lyrically intricate 'So Cruel', and of course the aforementioned 'Mysterious Ways' (if you wanna kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel, on your knees boy! - Can you say erotic?) U2 showed everyone here that they would not be tied down to the same old same old, and the results of their rebelliousness have worked beautifully.  U2's best since 'The Joshua Tree', it signalled a brave new step in an industry not always so willing to accept change - but U2 have, once again, put their critics to shame.
B00005JNX0|3.0|I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, \\"A Christmas Caper\\" just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, \\"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\\". In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, \\"Madagascar\\" has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.<br /><br />The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively.  While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the \\"Shrek\\" series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.<br /><br />Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors -  Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual \\"Born Free\\" movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.<br /><br />The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, \\"Mad Mishaps\\", are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and \\"The Tech of Madagascar\\" is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable \\"I Like to Move It, Move It\\" song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as \\"Enchanted Island\\", a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar.ce the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors -  Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a.

I'm waiting until there is.  I have a large screen tv and I want to take full advantage of it.  Plus, fullscreen sucks, you lose so much of the picture.
0399242864|5.0|My son just turned 5, and this book has gone into the top rotation over the last 3 or 4 months. He has also taken a great interest in space over the same period. He wants to travel to Mars, since I pointed out in the night sky recently. He's asking about other planets, that sort of thing. <br /> <br />Anyway the illustrations are beautiful, Jeffers style can appeal to  the young and old. The story plays upon a young child's wish to have a star of their very own, and the ways a young child would dream of catching one. I think a precocious three year old, up to a 6 year old could enjoy this story. <br /> <br />And just about every parent.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Although this album is only compiled from two albums, Portishead managed to release a live album Roseland NYC Live.  With this being a live LP, it sounds strikingly similar to its original studio albums with little or no alterations from that.  Because Portishead's sound and style is really dark, slow and deep with emotions there's nothing that involve getting the crowd involved, but they still seemed pleased with the performance.  Beth Gibbons' vocals sound just as spectacular live as does on the studio albums!
B00000I2PG|5.0|The raves here for this album are really nothing too extreme.  Every single moment of this disc is STELLAR.  So what if Martin is heavily influenced by Messrs. Bowie and Ferry?  It's what he does with that gorgeous instrument that really matters -- and the result is positively stunning. <br /> <br />It's a hugely overproduced mess, which only serves to point out how perfect the whole of the album is.  Overproduction has its place, and this is it.  Symphonic syrup collides with Bernard Taylor bass and some of the most clever pop lyrics I've ever heard.  An absolute, undeniable masterpiece. <br /> <br />Skip the hearts and flowers/Skip the ivory towers
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Best Disney film ever made, and this will not change.  In my opinion this is when Disney was at its peak.  I'm typically viewed as anything but romantic, but this really hits the emotional chords I tell you.  People are always stunned to see it's one of my favorite movies, with me being a pretty macho type usually.  I must admit, it nearly bring out the tears, so give it a try on some tough guys you know!  It is perfect in every way, I could not recommend something more strongly.  It has the songs, the comedy, romance, action, drama, strong and memorable characters, you name it.  The female lead is strong too, really a great persona.  Of all the Disney heroines, my favorite one, nobody else can even come close.  The theme song is unbeatable, beautifully done by Celine Dion and some other fellow.  Her best song too, ha why not add that accolade as well.<br /><br />It's great for winter time, as that is when the movie takes place (in France too, nice and classy+accents if you excuse the politics--which aren't present in the movie, I didn't mean to imply that).  Well I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but if you are one of those then you are missing out big time.  See it, have your kids see it, friends, relatives, dates, and anybody else you can persuade, or coerce!  Then get the theme song and play it on repeat, and picture the smashing ballroom scene in the movie (unforgettable)!
B000BKDOCA|5.0|Remix cd's were always an annoying thing to me. But this is Britney we are talking about and from what we have heard of her remixes in the past like the more mainstream remixes of \\"Boys (Co-Ed Remix)\\", \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix)\\", or \\"OverProtected (The Darkchild Remix)\\" which were all released as singles and her other edgier remixes like those on the bonus disc of her greatest hits (\\"Everytime\\" and \\"Outrageous\\")we know that Britney songs are made to be remixed. But here they are much more club trance type songs, but the really work. Britney's songs can carry themselves through all of the beats and bass. Thr songs can take on different moods in these remix forms. \\"Early Morning\\" loses its hangover type mood, \\"Everytime\\" becomes less acoustic and more trancey, and \\"Someday\\" also becomes less acoustic sounding and becomes deeper and more epic.  The album also includes a brand new Britney song \\"And Then We Kiss\\" which is great. If you are going to buy any remix album I would reccomend this one. It takes a while to appreciate but it grows on you.    STANDOUT TRACKS:  - Im A Slave 4 u *Might be better than the original  - Someday (I will Understand)  - Everytime  - Early Mornin' *which is an improvement if you ask me  - And Then We Kiss *Great new song!  - Touch of my hand  - breathe on me    BUY THIS ALBUM FOR GREAT CLUB LIKE SONGS!!!!
0930289455|4.0|I am so glad that I found and bought this batman title by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. I was getting my monthly fix of graphic novels from a local comic shop, I then thought \\"Hey, might as well see what other batman titles they have.\\", I was looking quickly at the covers to see what caught my eye, I then got to one that had that infamous cover with the joker on it holding a camera. I couldn't beleive it was there, because it is out of print and is hard to find in a shop out here, so I imediatly took it and purchased it with a whole load of other books I had chosen. I then had to read it imediatly, on the way home I read it and was blown away by the story that Alan Moore had scripted, and let's not forget the menacing portraits of The Joker by the astounding artist Brian Bolland.<br /><br />The Story:<br /><br />The Joker has escaped out of the mental house Arkham Asylum and has plans to put Jim Gordon on the edge of insanity, this story has one of the most infamous acts done by the joker, that is when he shoots Barbara Gordon (Jim's daughter) through the spine and paralyses her for life, but she is later to be a different sort of hero called the oracle. This graphic novel also includes an origin story, but an origin story of none other than the insanity of the joker. Alan Moore delivers another story that completely keeps us wishing for more twists and turns to keep us reading. Brian Bolland delivers striking art that puts you in the insanity of it all, and makes you get involved into the story that Alan Moore crafted. The reason why I don't give it a full five stars is because I thought it was too short, they should of thrown in more of the joker's history and more details concerning his life before all the madness. Overall this should be on your book shelf along with your other batman books, or even if you just started getting into graphic novels and comics, you should deffinitly own this. This is deffinitly the best one-shot story I have ever read. Own it.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|If asked to describe this album in one word I would have to pick: CHAOTIC. The reason for this is that for the forty or so, minutes in which my ears were first assaulted by System Of<br />A Down's latest vehicle Hypnotize, I could scarcely make sense of such a beastly, crushing, and charging album, so unbelievably fit into such a short amount of listening time. For those of you who are unfamiliar with SOAD let me fill you in thus far on their current body of work (catalogue):<br /><br />System Of A Down (Self Titled, \\"Hand\\") - 8.2/10.0 ~ SOAD's<br />unique blend of political lyrics, crunching riffs and Armenian flair and give them a contract; the world is good. Very ruff and distorted record, highlights are \\"Sugar\\", \\"Spiders\\" \\"DDevil\\" and \\"Peep Hole\\".<br /><br />Toxicity - 20.0/10.0 ~ In my opinion, their best work to date (however Hypnotize is coming rapidly closer with every listen). Features some of (once again, in my opinion) of the best songs of all time, the powerful, \\"Aerials\\", the hyper-fyed \\"Bounce\\" and the intense \\"Chop Suey\\".<br /><br />Steal This Album - 7.4/10.0 ~ A decent record, sort of a step<br />backwards from their privious work, highlights are \\"F*ck The<br />System\\" \\"Metro\\" and \\"Roulette\\".<br /><br />Mesmerize ~ 7.8/10.0 - The album that ushered in many knew SOAD fans (including myself), filled with the maximum amount of \\"pop\\" related elements a metal record can allow. Highlights include, \\"BYOB\\" (after being released as the first single it has been unfairly tagged with the \\"over-rated\\"<br />label), \\"Question\\" and \\"Lost In Hollywood\\".<br /><br />Now I will break down this album (Hypnotize):<br /><br />Attack - 8.4/10 A fast speed metal song with a awsome \\"mosh<br />pit\\" styled chorus.<br /><br />Dreaming - 8.5/10 A cool song, very spacey sounding and complex.<br /><br />Kill Rock n'Roll - 7.7/10 Not much depth lyrically , but<br />musically good.<br /><br />Hypnotize - 8.2/10 A good song to reflect on the day to, great lyrics and a soaring chorus courtesy of Serj Tankian.<br /><br />Stealing Society - 9.2/10 A very boppy, punk-ish song with a cool guitar-bass combo, rather poetic, calming lyrics.<br /><br />Tentative - 9.0/10 I can not begin to express how much I love the chorus to this song, the lyrics are extremely clever and make you think your about to be bombed.<br /><br />U-Fig -  8.5/10 A angry song, very direct and \\"to the point\\"<br />lyrics.<br /><br />Holy Mountains - 18.5/10 A song that \\"pushes the envelope\\" once again, for System as the experiment with throat-wrenching chorus's of \\"LIAR, KILLER, DEMON\\" which can scarcely be replicated in any live performance, reachs it's apphiney. Also spacey sounding and features some awesome harmonies, my favorite on the album.<br /><br />Obscenity Of Obscenity - 12.1/10 Unbelievably catchy, funny,<br />bizarre and crazy as it is, it inspires group sing-alongs; great disco/funky/carnival-like bridge. The next, \\"Bounce\\" (Toxicity, track 7).<br /><br />She's Like Heroin - 7.3/10 My least favorite on the album,<br />repetitive. Cool Chorous though.<br /><br />Lonely Day - 7.7/10 Technically pretty, however it is slightly boring and tired, the guitar solo could use some work but a<br />interesting listen some how.<br /><br />Soldiers Side - 9.4/10 The second half of the opening track for Mesmerize. A beautiful song which puts you in the perspective of a victim of war, great lyrics and beautiful music, the band works well together on this one.<br /><br />Overall I would say that System Of A Down's \\"white album\\" is definitely diverse and full of metal muscles and politically-based minds collaborating together. My pick for the album of the year! I would recommend this album to anyone who likes honest heavy metal with a purpose. Conclusion: As a whole I give this album 19.5/10.0l guitar-bass combo, rather poetic, calming lyrics.    Tentative - 9.0/10 I can not begin to express how much I love the chorus to this song, the lyrics are extremely clever and make you think your about to be bombed.     U-Fig -  8.5/10 A angry song, very direct and \\"to the point\\"  lyrics.    Holy Mountains - 18.5/10 A song that \\"pushes the envelope\\" once again, for System as the experiment with throat-wrenching chorus's of \\"LIAR, KILLER, DEMON\\" which can scarcely be replicated in any live performance, reachs it's apphiney. Also spacey sounding and features some awesome harmonies, my favorite on the album.    Obscenity Of Obscenity - 12.1/10 Unbelievably catchy, funny,  bizarre and crazy as it is, it inspires group sing-alongs; great disco/funky/carnival-like bridge. The next, \\"Bounce\\" (Toxicity, track 7).    She's Like Heroin - 7.3/10 My least favorite on the album,  repetitive. Cool Chorous though.

0060872675|5.0|This is a wonderful book, but to understand it in context it is important that the (adult) ready have read the companion work \\"Thud\\" first.  This is actually a story, within a story, and should be read promptly at 6:00, preferable to a small child. <br />Loved the book, loved the series, this is a wonderful companion book.
0062502182|3.0|This was soooooooooooo not my type of book, but was chosen by my book club.  The more I think about it the less I agree with the overall message that I got from the book (although my book club hasn't met yet, so maybe I misunderstood).  Following one's dreams is, of course, a good thing.  Doing so in the face of many things telling you to find a different path is not necessarily a good thing.   <br /> <br />However, I do have to say that for a book of this genre - inspirational, Oprah-style books - this was one of the better ones.  First, because it's short, so I was finished before I tired of being beat over the head with a \\"message.\\"  Second, because the writing (or translating, as the case may be) was excellent.  If you're looking for something for your book club that will add a little depth to your reading list, without bogging you down in a long book, this is the one to choose.
B000AP04EW|2.0|Obviously, this movie was not meant to have some profound message or uplifting plot that will leave us meditating on our own lives. It's simply a fun and entertaining movie. That was what it was meant to be, nothing more or less. Angelina and Brad were a great match for this film, they have awesome chemistry, and there is plenty of action and violence if you are interested in that kind of thing. However, I don't think this movie necessarily had to be 2 hours long! At first the plot of the movie was funny, interesting, and very amusing. But then I couldn't help but feel as if the movie was one big joke that was milking its punch line for all its worth. The story seems to drag along, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith's bickering, sly remarks, and attempts at killing each other (literally) starts to get old, boring, and a tad bit overdone and ridiculous. And some parts of the movie seemed to be confusing and rushed as well. First they hate each other, than act nice with each other (after nearly 20 mins of them trying to shoot and cut each others throat!), then chase each other in speeding cars, and so on. It gets exhausting and boring very quickly. But despite its flaws, you have to give the screenwriters credit for at least making the attempt to write an original action film. And it is a fun movie either way. However, it loses its mark at keeping me interested all the way through.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|The Concert for Bangladesh was shot on 16mm film with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (4:3).  When it came time to release it theatrically, it was matted (which is kind of the opposite of pan-and-scan) and blown up to 70mm.  Reportedly, the theatrical experience was very poor.  Pixels were said to be the size of ping pong balls on the screen.  That being said, this DVD lavishly presents the concert in the aspect ratio in which it was filmed, nothing is compromised.  It was not an uncommon practice in the 60's and 70's for film-makers to film in 1.33:1 and then crop out the edges of the composition to make it \\"widescreen-shaped.\\"  The benefit in doing this is that it allowed the director to construct 2 shots, 1 for the theatre (widescreen) and 1 for the TV (full-screen), without losing vital information in either version.  Stanley Kubrick filmed many of his later films using this technique.  In the case of Bangladesh, as most of the shots are perfectly framed for 1.33:1, it's doubtful that the widescreen release was something that was planned from the beginning.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Wow, 886 reviews on this film, now soon to be 887! The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is not only a cult classic, but a major cinematic phenomenon that has attracted an immense following. Considering the content of this film you might even go so far as to say it has established a \\"congregation\\" of its own.<br /><br />So sit down, relax, strap yourself into your favorite chair and say a quick prayer in preparation for a hallucinatory journey through the brilliant but borderline schizophrenic mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager dealing with a constantly shifting world of multiple dimensions.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection. Add to Jakes' nuanced performance the unnerving visual of a human-sized demonic entity dressed in a very bad rabbit suit and you have the makings of an experience unlike anything you've ever seen.<br /><br />A word of warning is necessary. Beware of possible side-effects after viewing this film. It you start hearing a low, modulated voice speaking to you in the darkness of your room make sure to have some rabbit food handy. You never know?
B000001ED1|5.0|I think \\"One of Us\\" is rather amusing actually, but perhaps that isn't the best place to start.<br /><br />\\"St Teresa\\" is the place to start. This remains one of my handful of favourite songs of all time. It starts with that glorious frenzied torrent of mandolin, leading into Joan's soaring, achingly magnificent vocal and one of the great choruses.<br /><br />The rest of it ain't that good, but it ain't bad either.<br /><br />\\"Ladder\\" is great, \\"Lumina\\" gorgeous, \\"Right Hand Man\\" is outright dirty. Even a Dylan cover just for a laugh.<br /><br />Something obviously wasn't right though, as Joan has never approached the peaks she scaled with this recording. \\"Righteous Love\\" wasn't a bad shot, but mostly it's been silence.<br /><br />Shame. \\"Relish\\" lives on however.
B00003CXAW|5.0|For many years, I scoffed at the original \\"King Kong\\" because of its stereotypical depiction of people of color.  I had never actually seen the movie in its entirety, thinking that it was a \\"relic\\" from an earlier age that belonged in a museum.  Of course, I have always been a fan of stop-motion animation, preferring it to the current CGI-based school of filmmaking. And, the original \\"Kong\\" is a landmark film in regards to stop-motion puppetry.<br /><br />Thus, I had to abandon my preconceived notions and look at this film with a more open viewpoint.<br /><br />And, I am glad that I've broadened my thinking.<br /><br />This double-disc set is a treasure for lovers of film, fantasy, and moviemakers that really love what they do.  It is no wonder that \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Oscar-winner Peter Jackson was influenced by the film and chose to do a remake.  The film sports big sets, an outstanding score from one of filmdom's greats, Max Steiner, and then-state-of-the-art special effects, created specifically for the film inasmuch as it was, arguably, the first of its kind: an epic of fantasy storytelling.<br /><br />Stars Robert Montgomery, Bruce Cabot, and Fay Wray - who will become a legend due to her famous \\"leading ape\\" - equate themselves well in this tale of a really, BIG ape.  Though the acting is somewhat dated, befitting the film's seventy-year age, the script is so well written that one can overlook the occasional hamminess and histrionics by the leading lady.<br /><br />Considering the film's age, it is rather violent and \\"Kong\\" is an equal-opportunity destroyer, eliminating dinosaurs, natives, sailors, subway passengers, and a unfortunate woman that he mistook for Ann Darrow (Wray).<br /><br />Filmmakers Merian Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack pulled no punches and did indeed make a film that has stood the test of time, influencing a bevy of younger moviemakers, including John Landis, Joe Dante, and the aforementioned Jackson, all who, along with others, offer informative commentary on the second disc's two documentaries.  Also, the film has encouraged me to seek out two silent films, produced by the same pair: \\"Chang\\" and \\"Grass.\\"<br /><br />Legendary stop motion animator Ray Harryhausen, he, too, influenced by the film, offers tribute to the movie's director of special effects, Willis O'Brien.  O'Brien would later supervise effects on the \\"Kong\\" sequel, \\"Son of Kong\\" and \\"Mighty Joe Young,\\" on which Harryhausen aided in the creation of the effects.<br /><br />Speaking of O'Brien, storyboards are presented of the animator's abandoned film  \\"Creation\\".  This story combined elements of Verne, Wells, Stevenson, and would have made an intriguing story.  Many of the concepts in that story would find themselves used in \\"King Kong.\\"  In fact, Jackson may have considered this story, as opposed to remaking Kong for a second time.<br /><br />But, that's another story.<br /><br />Jackson's remake, like Dino di Laurentis's 1977 version, has some mighty big shoes to fill!umentaries.

B000777J2S|1.0|Yep, the emperor has been shopping again.  <br /> <br />All the critics say it's great, so it must be. Er ... no. Actually - it's poop.  <br /> <br />It's just seemingly endless and utterly ludicrous whinging and whining that almost makes your ears hurt.  <br /> <br />Music to slash your wrists to. <br /> <br />
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Since it's release, this has been the CD I pop in to start my really kick the Christmas spirit in gear!!!  Whitney puts a new classic spin on all of the standards and \\"One Wish\\" brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it.  This song joins Donny Hathaway's \\"This Christmas\\" and Nat King Cole's \\"The Christmas Song\\" as my all time favorites!
0307276902|1.0|<br /> When i first started reading this book i liked it, but thought to myself \\"it is a bit far fetched\\".  That was before I realized that it was supposed to be non-fiction.  As a fictional story, this book would be entertaining.  As a supposed true to life recounting of events, it is full of obvious lies.  I almost can't see how anyone would believe that some of these events could happen.  I have worked for the airlines for years, and let me say, without a question there is no way that any airline would ever allow a bleeding, unconscious, under the influence of drugs and alcohol passenger on board.  No way. Nor do I believe that any doctor would send someone off in that condition, without first attending to their open wounds.  Why wouldn't he have been hospitalized where he was?  It doesnt make any sense. If Frey wanted to pass this off as truth he should have toned it down a bit.  As it is now, it is an entertaining story, but almost insulting in its bending of the truth.
B0000057C5|5.0|yes this is a great album, you don't need me doing another review saying what everyone else did about it.  it's great. <br /> <br />i'm meerly clearing something up.  regardless of the literal translation of the song Du Hast, which it seems a lot of people here are arguing over, there is an english version of the song.  in the english version he in fact sings this: <br /> <br />You <br />You hate <br />You hate me <br />You hate me to say <br />You hate me to say <br />And I did not obey <br /> <br />Will you until death does sever <br />Be upright to her forever <br /> <br />Never <br /> <br />Will you 'til death be her rider <br />Her lover too, to stay inside her <br /> <br />Never <br /> <br />so you can still argue over what the translation is, but that is their own personal translation. <br /> <br />and yes, buy this album
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This film deftly blends martial arts action and serious intelligent drama.  The closest thing it reminds me of is Angel Dust, a Japanese thriller with a similarly well-crafted feel and a similarly gripping and disturbing story. The visual style, fight choreography, suspense, and irony, as well as the exploration of memory, willpower, and responsibility kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the film.  Oldboy is reminiscent of The Usual Suspects in the way it encourages the viewer to work to figure out what's going on.  Highly engaging.  Recommended.  Note:  Very violent.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Just from hearing the first song on this album, you know that Stevens is incredibly original.  I do like this album, but I must say that there doesn't seem to be much emotion.  This is a great album, but not for everyone.
0399208534|5.0|Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a classic story that has been enjoyed by children all over the world since it was published in 1969.  This is a story that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  Through Carle's unique illustrations and die-cut images, the reader's attention is immediately grabbed when opening the first page to this fascinating story.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is also very educational.  The text teaches readers the process that a caterpillar goes through to become a butterfly.  It also teaches readers the importance of a healthy diet.<br /><br />  Eric Carle has a great respect for children and their education. \\"I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun\\" (The Official Eric Carle Website). All of Eric Carle's books have a lesson that all children can learn from.  Carle has a very strong love for nature, and feels that it is important to communicate that to his readers.  Carle uses animals as characters for most of his books.  Many subject areas that are found in Carle's books include: Science, Math, Health, Reading, and Art.<br /><br />  The Very Hungry Caterpillar story starts out in the middle of the night.  The caterpillar is only an egg sitting on a leaf.  One Sunday morning, a very hungry caterpillar popped out of the egg.  The caterpillar wanted to eat, and decided to look for some food.  Each day, the caterpillar eats more and more food.  Finally, the caterpillar becomes very big and fat, and decides to build a cocoon around him.  The caterpillar stayed inside the cocoon for more than two weeks.  Finally, he nibbled his way through the cocoon, and out came a beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />The genre of The Very Hungry Caterpillar can be classified as fantasy since caterpillars do not eat the same foods that the very hungry caterpillar does in this story.  In the story, the caterpillar falls into a dilemma of his own when he gets too fat.He then resolves this problem by building a cocoon and then forming into a butterfly.<br /><br />  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is an example of a good piece of children's literature.  According to the temple text, a good piece of children's literature must expand awareness.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar teaches the readers about caterpillars and how they transform into butterflies. A good piece of children's literature must also provide an enjoyable read that doesn't overly teach of moralize.  In The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Carle tells an enjoyable story about a caterpillar and the funny foods that he eats.  While children enjoy laughing out loud to the caterpillar's eating habits, they are able to learn the importance of healthy eating.  This book is also full of quality.  Although it is not as poetic as Carle's other books, the plot is somewhat convincing, and the description is entertaining.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar shows a lot of originality as well.  We are not only able to see this through the text, but through Carle's vivid illustrations, and die cut holes.<br /><br />  There are several classroom connections for The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Science, counting, pattern sequences, and days of the week are all classroom connections found in this story.  As a teacher, you can explain to your class how the caterpillar transforms from an egg, to a caterpillar, to a butterfly.  Teachers can then have your students draw the steps out on a piece of paper.  Teachers can conduct a math lesson using the different foods that the caterpillar eats.  Teachers can even have their students create their very own Eric Carle Art.  There are so many different lessons that can come out of this wonderful story that children can benefit from.  Eric Carle books are a must have in every elementary school teacher's classroom.
B00005JO1J|2.0|This movie will please any die hard Broadway musical fan. But this movie will not convert an average movie goer into liking a musical movie form. This movie dragged on and on. I'd rather see this as a musical play. The songs aren't even catchy except the ballad song at the end of the movie. This is suppose to be a rated R movie but is rated PG-13.  The movie showed people  dying of AIDS, lesbian relationships, actors freely talking about drugs and showing syringes, and a drag queen. And no i'm no saint. I'm liberal and gay but this movie should've been a rated R movie. Come on. How corrupt is that. Horror movies are always getting axed for being rated R and getting a edited watered down PG-13.  But non-horror movies have alot of sexual suggestions, bad language (yes the S word and the F word), and heavy violence but are rated PG-13. The Bad News Bears 2005 remake had a lot of foul bad language coming out of the mouths of child actors but was still PG-13??? What the hell is going on with the movie industry???!!!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Well, here goes. I purchased this item on September 17, 2005 which was just a very short while before my 18th birthday. Like other people, I had been skeptical after hearing \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" on an internet stream, and I thought Opeth had sold out. Like the last reviewer, I was too pleasantly surprised by the release of this work of art. If you look at it from a technical point of view, TGC is a pretty basic song considering the masterpeices Opeth have unleashed in the past, however considering the context of which the song fits into the album as a whole solidifies it's position as a solid song. I refer to it as \\"The Unleashment\\" song whenever it comes onto my cassette player in the car, because the calm song Atonement finishes, and this one busts in to give you one last glimps of Opeth's brutality before putting your diaper back on with the last track of mellowness, Isolation Years. Even the clean songs were masterfully done, Isolation Years could easily have become a radio single as well as Atonement. Atonement seems to be a very old-timey sounding song, with a very pleasant vibe. Nice soaring vocal lines as well in both mellow tracks.<br /><br />The heavy tracks are where Opeth truly stands out. The introductory gut-buster known as Ghost of Perdition introduces some strange new style that I don't think any true fans of Opeth were really expecting. Some happy-sounding clean vocals really took us by surprise, but looking back seems to make the track just the bit more exciting, and the rest of the epic unfolds from there. As most of you know, they recruited a new keyboardist named \\"Per Wiberg\\" who worked with Spiritual Beggars... He seems to be very talented and really added a whole new wall to what is the mansion known as Opeth. Yes, that analogy made me giggle also. Well, this is possibly one of the best albums of the new millenium so far, and is definately worth buying. Also check out Nevermore's \\"This Godless Endeavor\\". Opeth toured with Nevermore before, and they are both very fantastic bands., and they are both very fantastic bands.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's the Clash, what more shall I say? <br /> <br />Out of the many albums The Clash has put out, this is definitely the best. From amazing percussion and standout bass, to Joe Strummer's unique and irresistable voice (which Mick Jones' backup vocals add a lot to...and don't even let me get started on the amazing guitar) the CD has no weak points. <br /> <br />I got this CD for $10. $10. In my opinion, London Calling is worth $100, and if that's what it took to buy it I would. Isn't it amazing how CD's like this are supposadly \\"worth less\\" because they're old, yet Good Charlotte's \\"The Chronicles of Life And Death\\" sells for $19 at most stores? <br /> <br />EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS GREAT. The title track, London Calling, is probably the band's best song ever. There's a variety of music on this CD, unlike some of the albums other bands like The Ramones have put out (I'm not saying that the Ramones are bad, I'm just saying that their albums don't have as much variety as The Clash's...but then again, not a lot of bands are this good) , from reggae to jazz to alternative to punk to classic rock...the list goes on and on. <br /> <br />This probably isn't very important to someone who doesn't have the album, but here are the standout tracks: <br />-London Calling <br />-Hateful <br />-Rudie Can't Fail <br />-Spanish Bombs <br />-The Right Profile <br />-Lost In The Supermarket (great lyrics!) <br />-Death Or Glory <br /> <br />Overall, a masterpiece. The Mona Lisa of the music industry.
1558908382|4.0|This is a great movie, Cusack plays a role darker than some of his other comedic outings.  However, this movie is balanced by a lot of lighter comedy.  Funny, funny, funny.  Supporting cast does a great job as well.  Interesting plot, though perhaps a tad predictable.  Well worth the watch.
B00005O5CM|5.0|'Legally Blonde' is a hilarious and clever comedy. It is the story of a young sorority girl named Elle Woods. The movie begins to the song \\"Perfect Day\\" which really sets the mood. Elle is going out with a handsome, smart guy named Warner Huntington. Thinking he is going to propose to her, she buys a 'perfect' dress and meets him at the fancy restuarant he is taking her to, only to find out he is dumping her because he is going to Harvard Law School and wants to start a more serious life. Elle is heartbroken and devastated, so when she reads about a woman who is more Warner's 'serious type', she decides she is going to go to Harvard to so she can win him back!  <br /> <br />I'm not going to give away all the good parts, but I must tell you, if you are wanting to get a fresh, funny, and totally blonde kind of movie, RENT (if you have not seen it yet) OR BUY THIS! You will laugh and if your a sensitive kind of person maybe even cry too. The acting is great, although I think the Warner guy could have done better. But Reese Witherspoon, being the great actress she is, totally makes this movie totally perfect! <br /> <br />If your a girl between the ages of 13 and up, you'll definitely love this. It's a really girly, chick flick type movie basically about a girl who goes very far for her man. Guys, on the other hand, well, if your a really tough type, you probably won't be that interested. :). It's a five star movie and one of my faves (I'm 13). You need to see it! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Terrible piece of throwaway Hollywood big epic crowd-pleaser.  Drags on and on (and I just finished/enjoyed watching Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Extended Edition, so yes I have an attention span).  Brad Pitt can't figure out what he is supposed to do in this movie except grease his torso or bash people.  Brad Pitt CAN act -for better examples of Pitt's acting, see 12 Monkeys, Fight Club or even Legends of the Fall.  An finally, this version of Troy is very, VERY loosely based on the book.  \\"Based on\\" is a generous term.  Hopefully, this movie will be forgotten in a few years and no one will be reading this anyways.
0684803356|5.0|Rarely do I come across a book that affects me in a way that stays with me for months. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS was just one such book, [...]---be warned, not for the faint-hearted. FOR WHOM starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a \\"code hero,\\" a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine.   At the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now \\"gone bad.\\" He cares primarily for his horses. His \\"woman\\" Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the \\"love interest.\\"   I love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is exposed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.  [...]

B000AGTPUA|4.0|I enjoyed the book a few years back and looked forward to this film.  A lot of the fine, mysterious magic feeling did transfer to the screen in this movie about a young boy, a train to the north pole, and the spirit of Christmas.  I did find it a bit creepy in places and am not sure of its appropriateness for the very young.  I was very impressed by the technology used to transform the living actors into picture book characters.  I recommend this film to anyone who loves Christmas and loves childrens books.
B00005JO1J|3.0|But the performances in the movie RENT are excellent.  The singing is great, some of the vocal arrangements are great, and it's because of those great performances that I give this movie 3 stars.<br /><br />But aside from that, I don't think I like musicals.  I checked my watch 3 or 4 times during the film.  To me, musicals are a bit silly.  I mean, SINGING IN THE RAIN is a musical.  The songs are great songs and they're central to the show.  In RENT, the songs were just dialogue sung to a tune.  I'm watching the movie, there's narrative and action going on and then BAM! they burst into song.  It seems a bit silly to me.  The production should have made up its mind whether it was a movie or a musical.  I know it was a movie OF a musical, but for me, I wasn't buying it.<br /><br />However, the performances were excellent.  Angel and Mimi were my favorite characters.  Although the show was conceived 20 years ago when we were constantly inundated with news about AIDS, today it seems ironic that the movie feels dated simply because AIDS is no longer a news item in spite of the fact that more people than ever have the virus.  But that's not RENT's fault.<br /><br />In the very beginning of the movie, you go through 5 credits before RENT appears on the screen.  Articles in the LA Times say this mess is why it took so long for the musical to make it to the screen.  I'm glad it made it; like it or not, RENT is a part of American pop culture landscape, even if it does feel a bit dated.<br /><br />Go see it.  It's 2 hours 15 minutes out of your life.  Or should I say 135 minutes out of the total 525,600 minutes this year?
B000BCKFWK|3.0|First of all, I should say up front that Sin City is not the kind of movie that I would generally choose-I'm not a reader of comic books (or, as they now seem to be called, graphic novels), and although I do enjoy the action genre at times, I'm not a big fan of relentless, unnecessary violence.  And Sin City just might be the most violent film I have ever seen, so much so as to be to the point of absurdity (although, given that this IS an adaptation of a graphic novel series after all, maybe that is appropriate).<br /><br />The movie is actually a compilation of several interconnected stories, chronicles which are told via frequent shifts amongst both characters and time.  The style and general feel of the movie is quite similar to another dark film, Pulp Fiction, although I found Sin City to be more violent and less funny.  The movie opens with a short sequence between a man and a woman, two characters who I still haven't been quite able to place within the context of the rest of the film.  The main stories each feature a chief character:  Bruce Willis as a cop nearing forced retirement but out to save a little girl, an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as an ex-con out for revenge, Clive Owen as a vigilante who goes after the wrong man, and finally, back to Bruce Willis still playing the hero eight years later.  Each principal keeps up a constant stream of narration throughout their segment; this helps to provide necessary background information but becomes annoying after awhile.  However, the cinematography shines, as the film is shot mostly in gritty black and white with occasional splashes of color.  The lack of color actually diminishes the impact of the violence somewhat given that blood generally appears in the film as white, not red.  Did I mention that the movie is violent?  If you are sensitive to fight scenes, frequent maimings, and (not to mention) several beheadings, this movie is NOT for you.<br /><br />If you are a fan of DVD extras, this set is replete with them; at times, I was more intrigued by these than the movie itself.  Disc 1 contains the extended theatrical release plus extras which focus on some of the film's special features, such as the cars, costumes, props, and make-up that went into the making of the movie.  The car segment was particularly interesting, as it shows how various classic cars were sought out to help give the Sin City its film noir feel.  Disc 2 includes some more unique extras, including a fascinating \\"green-screen\\" version of the film shown at high speed:  in less that 10 minutes, you can view the entire movie sans most of its props and background scenes.  This disc also features each of the stories told individually-as originally conceived by creator Frank Miller-rather than morphed together as in the theatrical release.  Finally, this deluxe set contains a complete Sin City graphic novel of The Hard Goodbye (the story which stars Mickey Rourke).<br /><br />While not exactly my cup of tea, this movie was undeniably entertaining, with the included extras definitely making the deluxe edition worthwhile.  From what I could tell, the film stayed very true to Frank Miller's original graphic novels (almost TOO true, as the dialogue had moments that were undeniably comical, but not in the good way), and so I'm sure Miller's fans will be thrilled with this big-screen adaptation.  If you thought that Pulp Fiction was too tame, this movie is likely to be right up your alley, but those who prefer their action films with less violence should seek entertainment elsewhere.ith them; at times, I was more intrigued by these than the movie itself.

1401207138|5.0|I am 46 years old. I was a few years out of my teen-age years when 'Watchmen' was first published for the mass market. I remember reading the first issue of the mini-series run of twelve issues. I was absolutely inthralled by what I was reading. This was the best comic story I had ever read, period. I collected the entire run, and I still have them - bagged and tagged - and only read once. Soon, the graphic novel was published and I picked up a first edition. I read that graphic novel at least once a year, and the book shows the age from the use.<br /><br />  At around the same time that 'Watchmen' was published Marvel Comics published 'Squadron Supreme.' This was a twelve issue mini-series that was sort of/kind of similar to 'Watchmen,' down to the use of alternate universe heroes. This book was obviously counter programming to 'Watchmen.' This book was Marvel all the way in story content and art style, which meant that the overblown nature of everything was Marvel implausable. Compared to 'Watchmen' 'Squadron Supreme' seemed just like another Marvel comic book that was basically one long fight with lots of pyrotechnics and a weak story.  'Watchmen', on the other hand, just felt as if it could happen, because of the fantastic writer. The artist was a perfect complement to Mr. Moore. All this made 'Watchmen' seem even bigger back then.<br /><br />  Shoot ahead to twenty later, today. Now I have to read the snotty nosed reviews of obvious youngsters who cut down and disrespect everything that they cannot download onto their ipods. Some of the reviewers in this Amazon site have simply put down the greatest piece of comic book literature ever written. These reviewers know that 99.9% of the reviewers love 'Watchmen' because it is a masterpiece. But they just have to voice their negative opinions. One reviewer said he never even finished the book. How can you write in a fair review if you have never finished the book you are reviewing? It just sounds stupid to me. Some people should keep their opinions to themselves.<br /><br />  And guess what? 'Watchmen' is still the best comic book story ever written. I challenge anyone who has seriously read this book to list one comic book story that has the all around impact as 'Watchmen.' People are still re-reading this story over and over again twenty years later.
B000068IEU|4.0|`The Last House on the Left' is famed horror writer / director Wes Craven's very first movie, made in 1972 with a budget of about $90,000, and it shows. If this were not done by Craven and if Craven had not gone on to do so many famous and remarkably good horror movies, it could easily have slipped into oblivion. The quality of the acting, direction, and cinematography make Tobe Hooper's `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' look like a Stephen Spielberg masterpiece.<br /><br />The one thing that saves this movie is the realism of the horror. There is no improbably semi-mystical Jason or Freddie or Michael Myers here. This terror is created by all too real life dangers of slumming in an unsavory neighborhood looking to score some grass. In this very plausibly scary scenario, you can see the talent that created the much more professionally done and more highly charged opening scenes of `Scream'.<br /><br />The value of this DVD may still have been marginally historically interesting, if it were not for the modern audio commentary track by director Craven and producer Sean Cunningham. Among other things, they reveal that the story was taken from the plot of an Ingemar Bergmann film, `Virgin Spring'. The commentators quip that since Bergmann stole the story from some other source, it was fair game.<br /><br />In my mind, a commentary track like this virtually doubles the value of the movie, especially if one or more of the principles behind making the movie does it. This means their statements cannot be doubted, as they are simply describing their own experiences and impressions about the moviemaking process. You don't really need the filmmaker's word on this, but it is good to have their confirmation that this version has many of the more objectionable scenes restored. I suspect that most of these scenes were not the shots or blood but of skin and sexual content.<br /><br />The movie actually gains a fair amount of cachet in the light of recent real-life abduction, rape, and murder stories filling the news. It seems it is remarkably easy for a young girl to be forced into desperate situations.<br /><br />Most of the other extras tend to repeat the material in the commentary, except for the comments by the actors, some of whom were not professional actors at all.<br /><br />It seems that virtually the whole movie was filmed in producer Cunningham's home and environs. This did not deter from the movie, in that it the story simply takes place in the Connecticut suburbs anyway, so that was just as good or even better than filming on a Hollywood back lot.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of evidence that no one connected with the movie did a very good job of continuity and fact checking. A 1960 Cadillac is identified in a police broadcast as a 1958 Cadillac.<br /><br />If you are a died in the wool horror fan, you really should consider purchasing this movie. As weak and as cheap as it is, it actually holds up fairly well against some recent films by, for example, Dario Argento. Otherwise, view before purchasing to see if you want this in your permanent collection.pe, and murder stories filling the news.

B000B5XZLU|5.0|I've got 'em all and wasn't entirely sure about what to make of this album before I bought it--I was really hoping that a mainstay of my CD player wouldn't have put out a stinker. Actually when I first heard it I wasn't too sure what to make of it either, but it really grew on me. The music's pretty much all really good and it's a lot more stripped down than in the past. According to the little \\"making of\\" video on the DVD, this was the first album they did with ProTools, but it doesn't really sound like they lost it when they went to digital editing. Some bands really go nutball with ProTools and end up totally killing their sound, either by leaving too much in, making the tracks really repetitive, etc., but JKay and Company managed to resist that and keep things sounding fresh and dynamic.  <br /> <br />Faves: Tallulah, Hot Tequila Brown, Feels Just Like It Should <br /> <br />The only songs I guess I don't really get are Electric Mistress and Black Devil Car. They're not bad, but they just doesn't seem to fit with the rest and break up the mood of the album. &lt;shrug> <br /> <br />No dij, though.

B000000OUJ|5.0|First of all I must correct the previous reviewers who say this is the best from Wu-Tang, any fan of Wu-Tang from the golden years knows the best Wu album is Raekwon - Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, there is no question about that. This may qualify as the 2nd best though, brings back memories of the old days when I hear this stuff, I wish Wu-Tang was still this good but those days are long gone. Anyway get this if you dont have it, but make sure you get Only built 4 Cuban Linx first.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Alright, I'm coming from the viewpoint of a browncoat here, but regardless: this movie really was a masterpiece. The special effects were amazing, the acting is superb, the plot line is effective, and I really feel that justice was done to the series.  Yes, as a browncoat I was absolutely DEVASTATED by some of what happened in the story line, but regardless of my feelings (*sniffle-weep-bawl*), this movie was outstanding.  So many people have been \\"converted\\" to the series through watching this movie, so don't look at what I have to say, look at the statistics! From what I have seen of reviews from individuals who had never associated themselves as \\"browncoats\\" before, about 90% have absolutely raved about this movie and subsequently gone out to buy the DVD Firefly set. <br />(I also admit that I am NOT a Whedonite... Buffy=blah to me, although I do LURVE me some Titan AE). <br /> <br />I am thoroughly enjoying seeing the Browncoats on this board giving bad ratings to the less than positive reviews for Serenity.  Chill, guys. We all know it's a good movie, and they're entitled to their distorted... I mean, their own... opinion. (Just kidding!)  Look at the overwhelming number of positive reviews: I think we've made out point. No power in the 'verse can stop us... or Kaylee from getting her apples, hehe.
0553801503|4.0|These were the last words of the novel.  Needless to say...that was somewhat disappointing.  The endings to all of the other characters were cliff-hangers, and we are given this to mull over until DANCE comes out...wtf?  It should have ended elsewhere. <br /> <br />     So, with that frustration out, I have to say this is one of the best transition books I have ever read in an epic series.  And it is only half of the transition.  It is a strange thing, when all of the characters of the book are ones you hated(except Arya) in the previous installments, that you find yourself liking these same characters(except cersei). <br /> <br />     At a certain point, I realized that there would have to be an ending to the series.  The question is, who will I be rooting for at the end?  As Martin has often done in this series...it will probably be a surprise to us all. <br /> <br />     I have one more worry, however:  Because Feast was so long in the coming, and it had the complete story for half the characters, are we going to end up forgetting the cliff-hangers of this book by the time we see their stories again?  Re-reading this series is no small task.  ON the other hand, I can understand that there would be too many perspectives if it were to be fit into one book...It would be an aeon before we would see each character. <br /> <br />     I trust that Martin will not dissapoint, for he has us in a world so engrossing that we sometimes have to check and make sure that our own arms haven't been hacked off.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Yes I know, Michael jackson has put out waaaaaay too many greatest hits albums. But why should you get this one? Lemme break it down for you. let's talk about MJ's past greatest hits albums, History, Number Ones, and the Ultimate Collections. History and Number Ones all contain almost the same songs. Except for a few noticeable ones, they both contain well known hits by the king of pop. History contained the old hits by Michael jackson whereas Number Ones contained material spanning from Off the wall to invincible. Great songs, two great compilations. The Ultimate Collection was indeed, the ULTIMATE michael jackson collection. It featured songs from the king of pop from his early days with the Jackson 5, all the way to the present. It contains a few new tracks that were never released until the ultimate collection, as well as never before heard verions of songs such as \\"we are the world\\" and \\"pretty young thing\\". it also contains a LIVE CONCERT (Dangerous Tour Live in Bucharest). To me, (since  i'm a hardcore michael jackson fan), this was the most wonderful Michael Jackson compilation ever made. However, there are people out there who do not want to spend big money on this (it is quite costly). The ESSENTIALS is a 2-disc compilation. The first disc contains Material from the King of Pop that spans from his Jackson 5 days to Thriller. Great hits on this first cd are, \\"i want u back\\", \\"abc\\", \\"don't stop til u get enough\\", \\"rock with you\\" and many MANY more! The second disc contains material from Bad to Invincible. hits such as \\"bad\\", \\"man in the mirror\\", \\"the way you make me feel\\", \\"heal the world\\" are in this second half of this compilation. if you ask me, this album should be called \\"History\\" because it is a great way to have all of his well known classics all in one album. why pay over $70 for the ultimate collection? why pay over $15 for a greatest hits album that is so similair to the other (History and Number Ones) when you can have the Essentials for around the same price? The name of the album itself speaks for itself. This is indeed, the essential michael jackson collection.

No Perfect sound or big screens displaying all to the faithful worshipping at the church of Bruce.<br /><br />In 1975 Springsteen's 3rd album \\"Born to Run was a do or die. He'd blown that \\"big advance\\" Rosie on assembling the best house band in New Jersey possibly the US.<br /><br />Before the show Bruce had thrown a real hissy fit about the Marquee - to quote \\"The World is Finally Ready for Bruce Springsteen\\" - outside at the Odeon at Hammersmith a grimy little place in the West of London.

Truly unique.  <br />The live album includes some songs not heard on the dvd and will become a fixture in your music rotation for sure..... <br /> <br />Many of my friends and co-workers will receive Caught in the Act as their gift from me in their stockings. Great gift idea.
B00081U7HC|3.0|When Julia Roberts is mentioned, it is difficult to not picture her in her role as the young lady in Pretty Woman.  The modernized version of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion earned the young Roberts a Best Actress nomination and, more importantly, launched her into stardom.  Along with Richard Gere, the duo light up the silver screen turning a hopeless relationship into a lovely couple you can't help cheering for.   <br />After his recent break-up, Wall Street broker Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) encounters Los Angeles prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts).  After one fun-filled night, Edward offers her $3000 to accompany him to all his business meetings for the duration of his visit.  Her hysterical reaction can only lead the viewer to believe one thing; she has accepted.  I couldn't resist her contagious smile.  It was interesting to see her interact with the high-class society.  Her journey to the posh Rodeo drive while in her original work clothes, which consisted of a micro-mini skirt and a quite revealing tank-top, was among the more memorable scenes of the film. After being denied service by snobbish shop workers, she later returned properly dressed in designer clothes to flaunt what kind of commission they missed out on. <br /> Jason Alexander played the role of Philip Stuckey, Edward's long time friend who disapproved his pal's lustful ways.  After his unsuccessful attempt at taking advantage of Vivian, he forces Edward to choose between his best friend and his new love.  I can't deny that I was happy, and almost teary-eyed, to see the lovely couple achieve the Cinderella ending one could only wish for. <br /> In my opinion, this is Richard Gere's best performance.  As for Julia Roberts, I must say I'm not a big fan of \\"chick-flicks\\", however, I thoroughly enjoyed this classic. <br />
B00009RGBS|5.0|Most films have, to my eye, flat spaces--filler, scenes which could be dropped out.  Not this one.  Every moment a gem.
6305291446|5.0|I saw this last Sunday and as I have said before, this is the final installment of the Halloween: Laurie Strode Trilogy that composes of Halloweens 1, 2, and 7. Yes it was Micheal Myers' head that was chopped off and not a paramedic with a crushed larynx. The proof it is Michael is that he assaulted Laurie in the van, if his larynx is crushed he could not breathe so he would have died before he was decapitated, he was hit with a one ton (I think) coroner truck so therefore if that was not Michael he would have been killed, he had Chris Durrand's eyes (the one who plays Michael in H20) and if you were there and you were not Michael wouldn't you take off the mask and show that you are not him. Also none of that sequence took place in H20 so it did not happen. Buy the first two and this. Do not watch any other Halloween movies except 1, 2, and 7. Goodbye.
B000065PUE|5.0|There's a reason the Pixies have been lionized on their recent sell-out (take that anyway you want to take it)tour. They represent quality, the state of the art, the zenith, the apogee, of whatever you wanna call it, alternative,etc...These guys are the grand champeens, they did it the best...Arguably, without them, you wouldn't have had a Nirvana.... <br /> <br />There is tremendous craft, and art, and originality, not only in their patented loud/soft dynamic, but also in the totally new way they took dissonance and made it tuneful, poppy, even...It's funny how downright catchy their stuff sounds now - it sounded pretty crazy and out-there then. I think what that shows is not that they were \\"Tame\\" (one of the f-ing great songs on the disc) but that they have truly influenced the musical landscape. They, in short, have made noise employed in the service of great songs acceptable and mainstream... <br /> <br />By the way, \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" is an extremely cool song - anybody who doesn't get, well, just doesn't get it. Who cares if it's catchy? Like that's a sin. Maybe it is if what you're into is trying to be cooler and more out-there and more hardcore than anybody else and like the kind of music that really isn't music, just basically guys banging sticks on cans and screaming. \\"Hey, I don't really like it or take pleasure in listening to it, but it's more noisy and annoying than anything else so it must be good, and I'll be cooler than anyone else if I pretend to like it\\". <br /> <br />Also, the Albini comment has since been retracted by him. He was, he admits, just being pissy.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|Please don't read this if you are new to the story as this review contains spoilers. I've liked this musical since I heard the original casts' recording as a teenager. In college I finally had the opportunity to watch the musical in NY and put action and faces to the voices and music I had enjoyed for so long. Now, many years later, a movie version has come out. I did not know how I would respond to it, given that I liked the original version so much that any deviation would seem blasphemous! Well, I watched it and I DID like it! Here is what I did not like: The duel at the cemetery was strange and out of pace with the rest of the story. I agree with the reviewer who said that the Phantom would never have lost to young Raoul. It made him seem weak and less menacing. I'm pretending it never happened. And this is why I gave the movie 4 rather than 5 stars. Annoying also: some of the lines were spoken rather than sung. Anyone familiar with the original will be irked. Otherwise, it doesn't make a big difference. <br />What I did like:  <br />* Emmy Rossum is lovely as the naive Christine. And she sings beautifully, too! <br />* The movie explains a bit how the Phantom came to haunt the Opera in a way that isn't too intrusive or distracting. <br />* The stage version always gave me the impression that the Phantom was obsessed with Christine and that she, once she figured out he was not a real angel, was truly afraid. In this version you have all that plus something else: an irresistible attraction between the Phantom and Christine. She is hopelessly drawn to him. Raoul's fear isn't just that she will be snatched by the Phantom, but that she'll willingly give in and go to him. They are, after all, kindred spirits in the sense that they love music, the theater, and share true talent. I liked that spin on the story.  <br />* The sets and costumes are opulent and lavish. Real eye candy. <br />* Minnie Driver is a supremely funny Carlotta. She ad libs but it  is all consistent with her character.  <br />* I liked the flashforwards to the present time in the shades of gray (1920). The \\"old\\" characters got a good make up job- very believable.The ending was thoughtful, although not unexpected. <br /> <br />It is hard to move away from the original casts' recording when listening to the songs in the movie, but it's just a question of getting used to new voices singing old favorites. Some of the actors' voices are better than others, but all in all the result is good, even if at moments you find yourself longing for a little occasional dubbing by the original cast... <br />Now, totally irrelevant to the enjoyment of the film: did anyone else find the actor who played Raoul a dead ringer for Carson Kressley from Queer Eye? I found it distracting and half expected him to give the Phantom a make over... :-)
B000059TEP|5.0|Although often marginalized by my contemporaries, colleagues, and the world of academia at large, the character of Ode May Brown is one of the most riveting, pivotal, and important literary characters of the past two centuries and quite possibly ever. Not since Charles Dickens' character of Louis Fontaine and Shakespeare's obscure and typically underrated Thomas Jack Abercrombie has a character sparked a national revolution, packed theaters (stage, projection, or otherwise), and redefined the term \\"exoneration.\\" The 1980's, similar to 1923, was a time of prosperity, indulgence, and limitless thinking. With this hotbed of bohemian sentiment and excessive wealth to invest in the outrageous, the timing was perfect for imaginative works of zaniness and the fantastical. While stock-brokers were hitting it big on Wall Street, Andy Warhol was working in his \\"factory\\" in New York with Basquiat, Robert Greenwald was directing the yet unknown glitter-encrusted light and roller-epic \\"Xanadu\\" and Ridley Scott was preparing for work on his unicorn fantasy dream known as \\"Legend.\\"  Nobody was prepared for the cesspool of cinema stinkers to come in a period known as \\"the nineties.\\" Being the final decade of a century,one would think the world was ready for images and sounds that were out of this world. Instead, the world was treated (heavy on the sarcasm) to such gems as \\"Reality Bites,\\" \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"The Piano,\\" and \\"Basic Instinct.\\" Not only were these films and every other film in the decade minus two completely devoid of anything spectacular or colorful, but they lacked the charm of the previous decade. In fact, the only other creative work to hit cinemas in this decade in addition to the piece discussed in this manifesto was Evita (review coming soon). The decade had the number 90 in it and was a time of grunge, filth, over-sized sweaters, garbage, flannel, and various other low-life things. The stage was set for something better for audiences to feast on.    Breaking into this \\"Bleak House\\" that was cinema in the mid-90's, 1990 brought us a revolutionary picture that nobody would ever forget yet everyone strangely already knew because it was so engrained into the fabric of their being. Tired of grit on their movie teeth, people ate up this film with such enthusiasm. This film was Jerry Zuckers, \\"Ghost!\\" (Editor's note, the actual film title does not have an exclamation point in it because the marketing person at Paramount Pictures is an idiot. The exclamation point has been added because it should have had one in the first place.). Everything from the music (who will ever hear the Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody the same way again?) to the special effects were unfathomable.    However, while the film was superior to every film effort up until that point, the actual film paled in comparison to a small unassuming character housed within the feature presentation. Much like a priceless Merlot in a Dixie Cup or scribbles writing musings from Plato, \\"Ghost!\\" was simply a cheap container from Wal-Mart to hold something which surpassed everything anyone has ever known. That character was Ode May Brown. A character with such warm charm and charisma that  anything that surrounded it was rendered meaningless and often profane.    It is well known that the actress Whoopi Goldberg won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Ode May Brown. Many of my fellow and sometimes accomplished critics feel that her performance was nothing short of, well, amazing. This is the general malaise' and rhetoric that plagues both my writings and my acceptance in the mainstream media world. But I ask, and perhaps I digress, but to what capacity was Goldberg actually participating in? Going against the grain, I feel that Ode May Brown existed before Whoopi was even born and her character was not acting at all. Furthermore, the writer of this entry loathes Goldberg and feels that she has completely the only task she was put on this Earth for and can just as well disappear for all I'm concerned. The only thing about about Ode May Brown and the only thing Whoopi can do on this Earth that is worthwhile would be to make \\"Ghost! 2!\\" I'm not sure what exec. at Paramount has not set this production into motion, but rest assured, once this article gets out, \\"Ghost!\\" sequels WILL get made which, unfortunately, will revive the career of Ms. Goldberg, but more importantly will bring back Ode May S. Brown (if you know what the S. stands for, please e-mail me!!!) and her 2 lovely sisters to the big screen. For me, this mythic character is the most enthralling...\\"thing\\" I can imagine and I would pay sums of money to learn more of her origins. Prequel anyone?
B000001FFJ|5.0|It's incredibly tough to choose, but this is probably my favorite Waits disc. It combines some of the more out-there crazy sh-t, like Rain Dogs,  with the more melodic ballad-y strain of his songwriting, songs like Hang Down Your Head and Downtown Train (great song, even if Mod Rod had a hit with it).  <br /> <br />Other highlights include Gun Street Girl, a story song that, although it doesn't follow a strictly linear path, adds up cumulative detail very powerfully and sends a powerful message. I'm not sure what it means or why, but I will never kiss any women that hail from any street called \\"Gun\\", and Walking Spanish (a phrase that actually means something, it's not just a \\"Waits-ism\\"...)... <br /> <br />And let me not forget another pair of absolute stunner songs: Tango Till They're Sore and Jockey Full of Bourbon.  <br /> <br />It seems that a lot of the essential stuff from the Waits canon resides on this here LP! <br /> <br />
B00000DQSZ|2.0|Do you like hearing English phrases repeated ad nauseum in a German accent through a vocoder?  Like bleeping videogame music? <br /> <br />This is the album for you.   <br /> <br />I actually found this album inferior to \\"Man Machine\\"...mostly due to the terrible song-writing on this one.  But the musik is OK.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|For an album that she wasn't really involved in, Britney Spears' remix album is excellent on all fronts!  Only three songs are 3, 5 and 8 minutes long, but the rest of the album's songs stay in the 3-4 minute range.  Like the newer songs of And Then We Kiss and Someday (I Will Understand) in their remixes. Britney is writing her latest songs more this time on these two. Who knows what her next album will sound like  Familiar remixers of Hex Hector, Jason Nevins and Peter Rauhofer come up with some impressive remixes of Britney's songs. But the newer names of Dave Aude, Davidson Ospina, Valentin, Hi-Bias and Justice/Justice give the well-known remixers some stiff competition.  The remix of I'm A Slave 4 U is the best remix out of the 11 here, as it combines deep keyboards and rock guitars in the same song.  It has the best rhyhmic feel too.  Davidson Ospina's remix of Baby One More Time, sounds a little like Madonna's hit Vogue in terms of the pulsating beats.  Toxic has some hard driving industrial rhythms too--how Peter Rauhofer repeats the \\"Don't you know that you're Toxic\\" line of the chorus in those fills just makes the remix entirely different. He clashes some other lines from the song, even repeating Toxic over and over in the numerous echoes. This album surprisingly focuses on remixes of 6 songs from her last album In the Zone and selections from her past albums. It's very addictive, fun and infectious in most areas. This could get a lot of play in clubs across the nation! It has that DJ underground feel, very close to what Madonna did on Confessions of a Dance Floor. Although they're not expecting it to sell big, this is just out of left field here--very rare and suprisingly strong remixes!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Fantastic Movie.  Fans of SIN CITY & PULP FICTION will like this.  Great Music..a very raw rock/synthesizer sound.
B00000ILDE|2.0|<br />The additional material in this \\"special edition\\" doesn't ruin \\"Aliens,\\" but it definitely hurts it. One of the things I like most about the theatrically released version is that it's not just a sci-fi/action movie; it's also a deeply engaging thriller/mystery.  The \\"Special Edition\\" manages to remove (by adding scenes, ironically) most of the thrills and mystery. <br /> <br />Too much is revealed in the \\"restored\\" scenes about what happened to the colonists, how it happened, and why before Ripley and the Marines arrived.  All stuff the audience eventually learns anyway as the film progresses.  There's also some new, annoying, expository dialogue in which the characters basically answer some of the film's biggest mysteries (e.g. \\"So what's laying these eggs?\\") rather than letting the audience ponder them on their own and feel engaged in the storytelling.  <br /> <br />Under no circumstances should you watch this special edition before you see the theatrically released version. I'd buy this DVD only as a supplement the superior, original version.  If nothing else, it's interesting as a lesson in the invaluable contribution of editors to the art of filmmaking.    <br /> <br />
B000ASATZ8|3.0|PROS <br /> <br />- You get all 4 movies in one box, a great value at about ~$5 per movie! <br />- The first movie is the best but you'll probably also like the fourth (which is a prequel) and either the 2nd or 3rd if you haven't seen any of them yet. <br />- Inside is a coupon for $10.50 off a ticket to Peter Jackson's King Kong which opens in theaters 12-14-05 (valid until 1-1-06). <br /> <br />CONS <br /> <br />- Despite the claims on the packaging for 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, all four movies are presented in 1.78:1 NON-anamorphic widescreen. In fact, the video transfers are exactly the same as those on the previous DVDs. <br />- All 4 movies are on TWO discs - which of course means both discs are double-sided. ARGH. If you're not the type of person to handle optical discs carefully, forget buying this, you'll probably scratch everything up right away, no offense. <br />- To make matters worse for two double-sided discs, the DVD case Universal came up with is absolutely atrocious. It's one of those double-inset ones, where you've got sub-impressioned spaces for the discs, so you can actually see both discs simultaneously, but in order to remove the disc on the lower inset, you have to remove the disc on the upper inset first because it's on top. And doing that without touching the lower disc is easier said than done. Universal couldn't use one of those convenient double-flip panel DVD cases instead? This approach is just plain aggravating. <br />- The cardboard slip case that houses the actual DVD case is designed backwards, so the DVD case slips out from the left, instead of the right! <br />- Four movies on two discs screams cheapness. Why didn't Universal just put together all four DVD sets to make a four-movie mega-package? <br /> <br />MOVIES SYNOPSIS <br /> <br />Sorry, not enough space for write-ups of each movie, but you can read up on them individually here on Amazon, each one has lots of customer reviews! To sum up, the first movie is about the Graboids, big monsters that lurk underground and lurch out when they feel something moving on the ground! Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are hysterical! The 2nd movie has the \\"shriekers,\\" the next evolution of the Graboids. The 3rd shows the \\"ass-blasters,\\" the next next evolution. Gotta watch to find out why they're named that! Finally the 4th is set in 1889 and goes back to the origins of the Graboids. <br /> <br />SPECIAL FEATURES <br /> <br />Universal took some time to tweak the individual movies' special features for this package, so you'll find some additional stuff not on the previous DVD releases of the movies (some stuff was re-organized too). <br /> <br />TREMORS (1990) - Disc 1, Side A <br />- Newly added Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, with optional subtitles <br />- BONUS MATERIALS <br />-- The Making of Tremors, 53:34, 10-part documentary with optional subtitles <br />--- \\"How It All Began\\" (pre-production) <br />--- \\"Building Perfection\\" <br />--- \\"The Mechanical Effects\\" <br />--- \\"The Cast\\" <br />--- \\"Photography and Editing\\" <br />--- \\"The Creatures\\" <br />--- \\"The Miniatures\\" <br />--- \\"The Cliff\\" <br />--- \\"The Ending\\" (features an alternate ending) <br />--- \\"Creature Featurette\\" <br />-- Outtakes, 05:12 <br />-- Featurette, 03:58 (behind-the-scenes clips) <br />-- Theatrical Trailers, 04:03 (collection of the trailers, quite a few) <br />-- Kevin Bacon Profile, 03:02 (video interview on his role, with movie clips) <br />-- Michael Gross Profile, 02:33 (video interview on his role, with movie clips) <br />-- Reba McEntire Profile, 02:02 (video interview on her role, with movie clips) <br />-- Production Photographs, includes 16 stills <br />-- Tremors 2: Aftershocks Trailer <br /> <br />TREMORS 2: AFTERSHOCKS (1996) - Disc 1, Side B <br />- Audio presented only in Dolby Digital 2.0 <br />- Tremors 2: Aftershocks Trailer (same one provided on Side A) <br /> <br />TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION (2001) - Disc 2, Side A <br />- Audio presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 (not listed in DVD menus though) <br />- BONUS MATERIALS <br />-- Spotlight On Location, 14:43, provides a behind-the-scenes and looks back at the franchise with interview clips from producers/crew <br />-- Trailers <br />--- TREMORS (same one provided on Disc 1, Side A) <br />--- TREMORS 2: AFTERSHOCKS (same one provided on Disc 1, Side A) <br />--- TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION <br /> <br />TREMORS 4: THE LEGEND BEGINS (2004) - Disc 2, Side B <br />- Audio presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 (not listed in DVD menus though) <br />- BONUS MATERIALS <br />-- Audio commentary track, with director S.S.

B0002CHQWQ|5.0|Having got the SACD hybrid version that I discovered only when I brought it home from the store that it was made in Austria, I thought I'd get the Japanese mini-lp sleeve version to see if I had gotten a bum deal.  This version has excellent sound quality and really after seeing the others try, only the Japanese have so far truly mastered the art of making truly great mini-lp replica sleeves that not only look like works of art but also are able to stay in one piece without falling away in tatters like their EU cousins.<br /><br />As I don't have an SACD player, I can't tell you if the first disc I bought was really worth it but the sound quality is quite close when played on your normal cd player.  Given the big price differential and the fact that the one you eventually get from this site will probably NOT be from Austria, you may be better off getting the cheaper version unless you really need to get the mini-lp sleeve.  One for the collectors and for diehard fans everywhere.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I first heard \\"Me Gustas Tu\\" in Europe almost five years ago, loved it immediately, and tried to find it when I got back to the United States.  Unfortunately, while US culture spreads its music to the farthest reaches of the globe- come on, who hasn't heard of Britney Spears?- we don't absorb that much international music.  This fantastic album was shelved in the World music section, a small and spooky aisle frequented only by strange-smelling hippies in wooden clogs and all-natural Mexican knitted shawls.  The highlight of this album is right in the middle: the fantastic \\"Me Gustas Tu\\" and its short prequel, \\"La Primavera.\\"  I hope you enjoy Esperanza as much as I do.  Cheers!
0385338686|5.0|Award Winner Sophie Kinsella does it again in her novel \\"The Undomestic Goddess.\\" Samantha Sweeting is a 29-year-old lawyer living in London. A financial attorney up for a partnership at her firm, Carter Spink, Samantha has it all. But she loses it all in a moment when it is revealed that Samantha made a multi-million dollar mistake. In shock and at her wits end, Samantha hops a train and ends up at the home of Trish and Eddie Geiger, who happen to be in need of a live-in maid. Without knowing what she is doing, Samantha interviews and accepts a job as their housekeeper and cook. The only problem: Samantha can't boil water or clean a lint trap. But with the help of the handsome gardner, Nathanial, Samantha may be able to make a go of it.<br /><br />I never have anything bad to say about Kinsella's work. Her novels are so much fun to read. She knows exactly how to craft an  interesting and humorous work in the chick lit genre. Samantha is such a human character that any reader will be able to relate to her. And the messes she gets herself into are laugh-out-loud funny!<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel and all of Kinsella's other works.
B0000541AM|3.0|This Joe Silver late 70s brainchild, with Walter Hill in early career directing form, is pretty much considered a cult film with an uncanny ability to predict the dreadful style of 80s clothing and bad haircuts that would proceed it, is not really such an action packed movie, or very violent, but does have a number of interesting concepts, that are enough to sustain it. The title refers to a gang in the story, The Warriors, who after a city boss group truce meeting goes bad, must make their way from one end of New York City to the other, avoiding and fighting with other gangs along the way. Each gang, such as The Furies, The Boppers, The Rogues, The High-Hats, The Lizzies, The Turnbull A.C.'s, and The Gramercy Riffs have their own identity, such as baseball-bat wielding white crow-style face-painted mute killer gangs to gangs of women with a penchant for hostage taking. Much of these encounters are repeated over and over. It is the costume design that is on show here, rather than a plot or the names involved. All in all you will certainly want to check it out as an interesting piece of low budget action that seems to have some connotations with more popular independent films of the 70s, early 80s, but never really seems to want to earn the acclaim that those movies do. Certainly worth seeing once... but not exactly worth hyping too much.
078681859X|3.0|This seemed like a promising book at first, but reading it quickly became a chore. For one thing, there are no likeable characters; everyone, even Nathaniel, is cold, calculating, and arrogant. The only truly nice person is Mrs. Underwood, and she has only a minor role. The writing tends to get bogged down in long, drawn-out descriptions, and in my opinion, the story drags on a lot longer than it should have. After making it most of the way through the book, I finally tossed it aside because it was so depressing; apart from an occasional chuckle at Bartimaeus's antics, there were almost no \\"up\\" moments in the whole book. The situation seemed to get grimmer with every page. As other reviewers have remarked, this is DEFINITELY not a feel-good fantasy story.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|I grew up when the original CD's of this material came out. Anyone who complains about sound quality being improved thru remastering(and an occasional remix) should be forced to pay three times for the same material until the record companies or the artists themselves get it right. I agree that much more extensive time should be devoted to the booklet because this is what should make a collection such as this worth purchasing if you already own most of the material.
B00008RH3L|5.0|The brothers Coen deliver us a wonderful gangster film, different, sophisticated and energetic. An effective work, without major artifices, it shows us the criminal world in all his brilliance. The  performances of Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturo are simply brilliant. Written with mastery and directed with nerve, the Coen deliver us a new masterpiece.
1559408855|1.0|There are so many reviews here that hail this as a masterpiece, as a landmark in cinema history...and then they complain at the poor acting, editing and script. So what exactly makes it a masterpiece then? Beats me.  <br /> <br />Ok, you have to admit that the main reason people watch this is to get shocked, offended and generally freaked out at some of the weird stuff they'll see, but at the end of the day I found it boring. Yes, even the 'distrubing' scenes seemed so over-the-top that they just didn't seem realistic, and after it all ended I felt violated. I felt like someone had come into my house, destroyed my belongings, beat me up, beat up my parents, raped me and made me eat s**t. That's basically what the films about. And if you enjoy watching that... you need help.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Every so often, an absolutely magnificent sports film comes along - and this is one of them. A relatively unknown cast, apart from the always reliable Billy-Bob Thornton, delivers heart-felt performances. Based on a True Story. The film follows a group of teenage boys giving everything they have to win and get out of their small \\"going-nowhere\\" town. Juggling class, relationships, family problems and a \\"zero tolerance\\" loss syndrome from the town's folk - they've got their work cut out for them. It's the kind of movie that has your hair standing on end up the back of your spine. Excellent direction and a phenomenol performance by Country Singer TIM McGRAW as one time football star eeking out an exsistance in the small town - living only on his name and what his name once brought him. Also watch out for Lucas Black - who's going to end up as one of the biggest up and comers in Hollywood! A GREAT MOVIE - YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN. In the same vein as, REMEMBER THE TITANS & MIRACLE!!!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|The nerve on this woman. I can't believe that she is seriously going to release a diamond edition of this album in late december, considering she only re-released it 2 weeks ago!!!!! This must set some sought of record, if only one for the most greedy artist in the history of music. Please boycott this release at all costs!!!!
B000AYQLX6|1.0|Many reviews vary on John's Walls And Bridges but i must rate this one 0 or 1 stars. The ORIGINAL album is great but this remastered version is horrible. Yoko Ono has changed the album by taking the Apple Co. logo off the inside of the album. This was recorded while John Lennon was dating May Pang and suddenly one of the songs he wrote about loving May now has the words \\"Yo-Ko\\" chanting in the background. The most signifigant and disturbing alteration to this album is the removal of John Lennon's art from the cover. He used to have one of his original drawings on the cover but Yoko removed it. She also appointed herself as producer. WARNING! Walls And Bridges is a stellar stellar album but the original is better. The original was made by John Lennon and approved by him. Buy the colorful copy with John's artwork on it not the one with him and 4 sunglasses! Good Luck Buying.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|Three and a half stars.<br /><br />Jim Henson (the creator of the Muppets) had been dead, dead as a door-nail, for two years when this Muppet movie was made.  His son, Brian Henson, manned the helm for this entertainment venture, and the results are pretty good.<br /><br />Oh, the cleverness and imagination that marked \\"The Muppet Show\\" and \\"The Muppet Movie\\" are not in full force here, but they are here, and those of us who loved those earlier Muppet capers will get a satisfying portion of the ... entertainment ingenuity that Jim Henson was famous for.<br /><br />This puppeted version of \\"A Chrsitmas Carol\\" is surprisingly faithful to the original story (as it was written by Charles Dickens).<br /><br />Michael Caine plays Scrooge, and I think it is among his best efforts as an actor.  He clearly took the role seriously, and his performance bumps the movie up a grade (as quality entertainment).  Most of the other characters are, of course, played by Muppets.  Well known roles are filled by well known Muppets ... which is fun.  The few other parts that are played by people are played by very good acting people (I felt) ... not name actors, but good ones none-the-less.  However, Muppets abound!<br /><br />The original songs for \\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" were written by Paul Williams, which would incline us to expect some pretty good stuff, but he (Williams) does not come through for us here.  They're not terrible songs, however, just not memorable ones.<br /><br />But this movie is a nice frolic through the pages of a friendly old classic ... fun for even the youngest of viewers.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Director : Sydney Pollack : GENIUS!!! <br />So, I'm wondering around the Video Store and see a DVD cover with SEAN PENN and NICOLE KIDMAN starring in a Sydney Pollack film. There is no hesitation.  <br />To be honest I'm not the biggest Kidman fan around... not sure why but just find her a little too plastic somtimes. This film changed all that... <br />A subject matter close to my heart living in Africa only a few thousand kilometres away from Zimbabwe. This film struck a few cords / mirror images. <br />Filled with Political Intrigue : It follows the story of a once loved / now despised African Leader responsible for Genocide in his country. Coming to the UN to defend his actions with a \\"Please Help - Know Nothing - Denial\\" attitude!!! An INTERPRETER hears a planned assassination discussion for this leader in a language that she and only another \\"handful\\" of people in the world can actually speak!!! Now, can she get anyone to believe her? Enter \\" Twists, Turns and New Discoveries\\" that may end up placing her as a Suspect rather than Witness!!!   <br />Filmed entirely at the UN BUILDING!!! A feat never tried before... even footage from the actual General Assembly. Sean Penn is phenomenal (as always) and Kidman truly superb. <br />Look out for a cameo from Pollack. <br />This film will have you on the edge of your seat. <br />SUPERB THRILLER... A must see!!!
B000669GAI|5.0|Released late in 2004, \\"Rearviewmirror\\" gets my vote for best listen of 2005, as it's hard to beat a double disc of greatest hits when you've had this many.  Other 2005 favorites include Bonnie Raitt's masterful \\"Souls Alike,\\" the brilliant \\"Chavez Ravine\\" by Ry Cooder, as well as new ones by Juanes and Blue Merle; special mention also of Jeff Black's wonderful \\"Tin Lily.\\"  But Pearl Jam's greatest hits compilation delivers an overview of this band's influential work that should be a part of every music lover's library.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Making Movies is a great album. Every song is a classic, just <br />like Love Over Gold. My favorite song on the whole album is Expresso Love, just gives me so much love, if you do repeat it <br />like 3-4 times, and also rocks. Skateaway is a pure hard rocker <br />with lovely lyrics, and is my 2nd favorite song on the album. <br />Tunnel of Love, a classic all three versions of this song are <br />great. Romeo & Juliet is good too, but better live. Les Boys is <br />a great album closer, not as good as It Never Rains but close. <br />Then Hand in Hand is good too, every song on this album are pretty good. Another worth 5-star album. <br />Buy this with Love Over Gold and take a <br />highway trip like I do. <br />
0375414053|4.0|The ending of the book is disappointing, politically and otherwise.  Pearson navigates the story's tensions so brilliantly through most of the book but at the end they seem to back her into a corner.

B000B5UL7G|4.0|That title refers to the mystery of why Robbie Williams is the biggest singing star in the world EXCEPT the US.  I guess we are too busy lauding vapid \\"talent\\" like Mariah Carey and Eminem.  Too bad for the US but if you want something fresh and not run of the mill - you could not do much better than Robbie Williams.  His new cd marks a bit of a departure from his previous releases.  He has a new collaborator in Stephen Duffy and has matured a bit as a songwriter.  That's not to say that Robbie's signature branch of cheeky bravado isn't watered down - it is just infused with a new flavor.  All in all a solid release.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I love this, every song on this has to be 5-stars. Out of all <br />Dire Straits albums, this is my favorite one. Every song just <br />ROCKS. The album starts out with just construction, then gets <br />better and better as it goes along. The last song, It Never Rains <br />closes with great heavy metal from here to there.  <br />Definately 5-stars. <br />
B000003TA9|2.0|Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to. <br /> <br />I understand this is \\"experimental\\" and \\"innovational\\" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart.  <br /> <br />The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because \\"Drunken Butterfly\\" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through.
B00005JNJV|5.0|It's been a bumpy road for the Caped Crusader over the years!!! Too much colour, too many actors, and not enough Fear in the Suit!!! Fast forward to the finest Comic Book to Film adaptation ever. Christian Bale (best known for his roll in American Psycho : enough to give Batman the edge he needed!!!) gives a stone-cold performance, flanked by the always exceptional Michael Caine (fantastic portrayal), Morgan Freeman (provides a bit of comic relief) and Liam Neeson (One of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood). Along with Katie Holmes and Rutger Hauer, as well as Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later) and Tom Wilkinson (from The Full Monty who gives the finest performance of his life as Bad Guy : Carmine Falkone. You won't recognise him!) Finally, rounding off the cast are Gary Oldman and Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) - wish we could have seen more of him. Great Actor. Director Chris Nolan who brought us MEMENTO and INSOMNIA continues his dark voyage and brings us what Batman should always have been A TERRIFYING FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH... not a colourful stand-up comedian dropping one liners every 5 minutes. Be Warned : This is really not for young kids - some scenes may be disturbing for young viewers. OVERALL : The Best Batman film ever : Awesome special effects, Outstanding visuals (landscapes, cityscapes and aerial photography) - enough Action to sink a battleship and overall the peace of mind to know that as long as Nolan stays behind the camera and Bale wears the pants in this relationship : BATMAN WILL RETURN!!! AND WE WAIT IN ANTICIPATION!!! Buy it now, crank up the surround sound and watch movie making at it's best.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|Let the buyer beware - Listen before you purchase<br />****************************************<br />I gave this disc several spins. I could not endure the pain bravely. If I had one word to describe it... Noise. Don't let the editor's at Amazon dupe you (or any of the other reviewers here), but I've found absolutely no comparisons to anything Mars Volta has done to that of any of the classic bands like Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. Anyone who says so is foolish in my book... and is simply jumping on the bandwagon of other said reviews. The lead singer reminds me of a spanish Shannon Hoon (from Blind Melon). Mainly due to his tone, and his unique delivery. With \\"Frances The Mute\\" catchy hooks and even melodies are... absent. Is this a good thing (is this why Frances was a mute)? And, since I don't speak or understand Spanish, there are several songs that are totally expendable. The 'progressive' adjective used to describe the band by other reviewers is insane. Mars Volta belongs in a catagory all by themselves. Perhaps this is one of those 'college' bands trying to make a statement? If so, it won't last. One half star for originality, and another half star for track 2, \\"The Widow\\". Otherwise, the other 11 tracks and all 70+ minutes of this disc is a pure abomination to my ears. The instruments going in completely different directions is insufferable. Not to mention some of these repugnant songs lasting 20 and 30 minutes each. If this is a sign of things to come, please slit my wrists now. I'd rather listen to my out-of-breath asthmatic dog snoring for an hour. Really.
0307276902|4.0|I think the book really shows the reality of drug use and what really happens when you abuse drugs.. Some parts were made you cringe and some parts made you feel really bad, but you gotta think that he put himself in that position. It is really sad that so many people turn to drugs and alcohol now days to get rid of there problems.. In reality it usually makes things worse for them....
B0007OCG4W|2.0|I watched this movie on the recommendation of the wealth of positive reviews about this film, and, in the end, found myself wanting a lot more. <br /> <br />In the plus column, the movie is largely extremely well-acted. Natalie Portman shows why she was considered one of the brightest acting talents before doing a regrettable trilogy for an absolute tourniquet of a director in George Lucas. Her character radiates charisma, sexiness, and vulnerability through a tough exterior. This is an absolute standout performance. Jude Law's Dan takes the greatest arc of any of the characters in the movie. Clive Owen has garnered a lot of attention for his ferocious portrayal,  though I am not as impressed here, as his character seems inconsistent. Julia Roberts, among this cast, seems comparatively wooden, but she diserves credit for not being caught up in some of the over-acting that threatened to taint a lot of the scenes. <br /> <br />But the movie is driven entirely by the four main characters, and none of them establish themselves as likeable, or even central. As you might have gathered from above, Alice (Portman) is the most immediately likeable, but even much of her charm is undone at the end of the movie. Essentially, this has the effect of pushing the viewer away, which makes it difficult to watch the movie. The lack of identification with chracters makes it even harder to understand their motivations. In fact, a lot of their actions veer into the \\"unfathomable\\" range, which, to me, is really the movie's undoing. \\"Closer\\" unflinchingly shows the horrible things that people can do to each other in a relationship, but never provides an understanding as to WHY, which makes it more voyeuristic than artistic. <br /> <br />In many ways, I can see why people review the film positively, because the craft of this movie is impressive. The movie is beautifully shot, and scenes are brilliantly framed. Law and Owens's long dialogue in the doctor's office, with the site of the latestinfidelity looming quietly in the background, seems to reflect the unending spectre of guilt hanging over all the charcters. That said there are two criticisms of how the film was made. Firstly, the passage of time is very unclear, and when the dialogue attempts to announce that (e.g. \\"We've been having an affair for a year.\\") it comes off more a lie by the character than exposition. Characters get married without a hint to the audience. Secondly, the nudity clauses in the actors contracts are painfully on display here, largely centered around Natalie Portman being the ONLY stripper in the club not shown, and the movie being carefully edited to avoid showing anything. This is not because I have any particular interest in seeing her naked, but because the fact that she COULDN'T be filmed nude altered the natural portrayal of a scene enough to break suspension of disbelief (of course, with a different line of employment for her character, this is not an issue, but that would disrupt much of the film's plot). Of course, these are really quibbles, compared to quality of the work as a whole. <br /> <br />As well-crafted as this movie is, as rich in talent as it is, at the end of the day, I did not enjoy this movie, and found myself unable to reconcile the characters and their actions. As unlikeable a group as they are, to compound this with incomprehensiblity really turns me off, and, in addition to not enjoying the movie, I found myself unable to appreciate it. Ultimately, no matter how well-done the film was, these faults prevent me from rating it any higher than I have.
B000002LFZ|4.0|When this disc originally came out, it served its purpose as a solid greatest hits package for Fleetwood Mac during their late 70's/early 80's, post-blues lineup.  These songs, excepting the new ones, were all released between 1975 and 1988.  Easily recognized hits like \\"Rhiannon,\\" \\"Little Lies,\\" and \\"Hold Me,\\" are all here, as well as \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way.\\"  My personal favorites include \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"As Long As You Follow.\\"<br /><br />Every song on this collection is wonderful, even the new ones.  The only problem with this album is that it is a tad bit outdated.  The dual disc greatest hits package is more complete, but I purchased this disc well before that one came out.  It's still pretty good for those with just a passing interest in Fleetwood Mac, but for real fans, this seems a little unnecessary now.<br /><br />Recommended to casual fans and completionists.  It's a great album, but it has collected a little dust over the years.
6300181553|5.0|Most of the reviewers for this movie do a fine job of giving an accurate description of the plot of the film - it's lightweight, enjoyable holiday fare and Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas' alone is worth the price of admission.  The focus of my review is essentially on the 'Abraham' musical number where all of the white performers are in 'blackface.'      In spite of a cultural understanding of 1940's Hollywood, I think we've been culturally conditioned to be offended by the 'Abraham' sequence and interpret it as racially insensitive.  As a person in his mid-forties, I, of course, didn't grow up with this kind of entertainment and, as expected, it made me uncomfortable the first time I saw it.  After several viewings, however, I began to realize several things - first, the performers are singing about the black emancipation set forth by Abraham Lincoln (a positive and sympathetic portrayal); secondly, it was, in part, a 'disguise' to hide Marjorie Reynold's character from discovery by Fred Astaire, and, most importantly, the performance doesn't attempt to ridicule ANYONE with the number.        I find it interesting that because of political correctness with regards to racial issues, several films from this period have yet to see the light of day in 21st century America.  Many television broadcasts of 'Holiday Inn' delete the 'Abraham' sequence.  Disney has NEVER released 'Song of the South\\" via VHS/DVD in this country - although they are only too happy to have it commercially available in Great Britain and Japan.      With regards to racial sensitivities, I look at entertainment today (by all races) and it's amazing to me how much of it I find truly offensive.  Stand-up comedy is almost all vulgarity, much of it coming at the expense of ethnicity.  Rap music thrives on vulgarity and proudly markets itself as such - without shame.  The 'N' word, along with similar epithets, is used profusely in this music.  I'm embarrassed almost every time I turn on the television during major network prime-time or see the musical 'acts' on late night television.  This entertainment truly does offend the major populace in this country - yet we're led to believe that 60-year old movies represent some of the most 'offensive' entertainment in our history.     Please tell me - is today's popular entertainment truly LESS offensive than Bing Crosby putting black make-up on his face?
6304711891|1.0|This movie is horrible. Exactly what is Ed Harris mad about. Nick Cage does his usual over acting,I can't believe this guy won an Oscar.
B000002LJW|4.0|It took me a while to warm up to this album.  Being a long-time EC fan, I had to pick it up as soon as it was released.  Radio stations played \\"Pretending\\" and \\"No Alibis\\" too often for my taste - I thought they were fine songs but my favorite Clapton songs are, shall we say, less sugary.  I did recognize a few fine songs right off the bat, including \\"Bad Love\\", \\"Running On Faith\\" and \\"Old Love\\", but being an album listener at heart, maybe this disc just came across as too tame for my expectations.<br /><br />As time went by, it's grown on me as I've learned to listen into the music more fully.  After initially being unimpressed with \\"Hard Times\\", I now really appreciate it.  Having initially been somewhat indifferent about \\"Hound Dog\\" and \\"Before You Accuse Me\\", these days I enjoy them.  Even \\"No Alibis\\" sounds good having been removed from top 40 playlists sufficiently long to have a breath of fresh air behind it.  I still have difficulty deciding on a star rating on it as a whole album and I don't give up 4 stars easily, but this is just too good to drop it to 3.  I can't put it in EC's top 10 albums of all time but for sure it's in the top 20 range.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good in general.  Some of the drum tracks sound electronic and dated, but Phil Collins was into that sound back then, so that's what we have.  Eric got great guitar sound and decent to very good vocals on tape.  The band certainly played very well, as we'd expect in support of such a distinguished journeyman.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|Well, I've heard both sides of the story here about this album. Some say it's horrible and predictable, and others say that it's really great. I personally think that it's in the middle. It's not horrible, because they're using the old Enya sound still - which is a really good sound, but they're not really progressing much in any direction. It reminds me of alot of other bands that come up with a good sound, but don't want to venture out of it. Why? Well, in this case - I think it's because they don't have any ideas as to where to go. And well, now looking at the sales chart for this, why would someone want to make the effort when instead you can put out stuff like your older material and hit #1 on sales charts? Although it's really sad to see Enya have to take 5 years to produce this, because I really doubt that all 5 years were spent writing this...it's just not that groundbreaking. Now if they had come out with something really different - but still Enya - then I could see the 5 years, but it's really annoying to wait for that large amount of time just to see new material be alot like \\"A Day Without Rain.\\" <br /> <br />In any case - I can say that this album will please devoted Enya followers, or if you're new to Enya but liked ADWR....but if you're someone like me who doesn't enjoy purchasing the same album twice - I'd recommend just buying her older stuff if you don't have it already, and enjoying that. Or if you want a few new moderately good songs from Enya, just download them off of itunes, because since hearing this album from a friend - I came to the conclusion that if I had bought that album I would feel a bit ripped off, and as if I could have just spent 3 or 4 dollars on itunes downloading the few standout songs. <br /> <br />In conclusion - this is not groundbreaking or a standout album, but rather - it's just average, and will probably get boring the next time that I listen to it.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Jaime Foxx and Tom Cruise do it again in this movie! They definitely prove their acting abilities in this fast paced hitman action film. The question I've been asking myself is would I go along with a hitman if I knew he was killing people. I wouldn't have done some of the things Foxx did, but who knows.<br /><br />This movie is awesome and I highly recommend this film to anyone. One of the best movies of 2004
B00062J00S|5.0|IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is arguably one of the best films ever made - certainly the best Christmas film. Frank Capra is one of the most talented directors Hollywood ever produced, and he considered this to be his favorite film. It has been called sentimental - I would call it heart-warming. It is full of what makes life - and a film - wonderful. As far as I know, Jimmy Stewart was the only actor Capra ever had in mind for the part of George Bailey. This is not true of the other characters, although it would be hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles other than the talented cast he chose. The script is superb, the set is one of the largest ever built, the cinematography is excellent. It is, in essence, a wonderful film of a wonderful story of a wonderful life.<br /><br />You can't beat a story about a person whose life is falling apart, finds himself on the brink of disaster and, through some turn-of-events, changes and comes back. George Bailey is such a person. He has spent his life doing the right thing and helping people whose backs are up against a wall, only to find his own back there and no one to help. He once had big plans for his life - he wanted to build things - but circumstances and his own character have not allowed him to realize those dreams. He has ended up doing the one thing he told himself he would never do: end up living in Bedford Falls running his father's Savings-and-Loan.<br /><br />But he cares about people. And he's got some wonderful relationships, not the least of which is his wife Mary, played by Donna Reed (who was an unknown at the time). Mary gives George everything he needs in a spouse: love, respect, support, a home, a family and a wonderful companion. George is blessed, but his life has not been easy, especially because of the town \\"Scrooge,\\" Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore. Potter owns everything - except the Savings-and-Loan. He'd like to own it, but George Bailey stands in his way. The Savings-and-Loan is the only way average people can own a home in Bedford Falls. If Potter gets his hands on it, he'll control the lives of everyone in the town and be able to keep what he calls \\"the riff raff\\" in his slums.<br /><br />Now, once again, circumstances take a turn for the worse: Uncle Billy (played by Thomas Mitchell), who works for the Savings-and-Loan, loses $8,000. In 1946, at the time of our story and the movie, this is enough money to put them out of business. Potter, who is aware of the loss, sees this as his opportunity to destroy the Saving-and-Loan and put George in jail. George desperately turns to God in prayer. Then, depressed, he gets drunk. Then, hopeless, he decides to take his own life by jumping off a bridge - but he's stopped by an angel.<br /><br />He's not just any angel: he's an angel second class named Clarence (played by Henry Travers), who is striving to earn his wings. Clarence is like someone out of the 19th century, when he had his last assignment on earth. When George tells him that it would have been better if he, George, had never been born, Clarence gets an idea. He decides that the best way to help George see the value of his own life is to show him what the world would have been like without George Bailey.<br /><br />It takes some convincing for George to realize that things have changed: he hasn't been born, so all the good he's done - including saving his brother's life, who later saves an entire ship of Navy men - never took place. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, a decadent cesspool of hopeless despair. After George experiences incident after eye-opening incident of the difference his life has made, he returns to the bridge and cries out to God to let him live and to take him back to his life, which He does.<br /><br />Even though his circumstances haven't changed, George has. He realizes that, in spite of his circumstances, he is living a wonderful life that is making a huge difference in the lives of others. Before it's over, he realizes something else: because of the life he's living, he has a lot of wonderful people who care for him. As his brother puts it, \\"To George Bailey, the richest man in town.\\" George is rich, but not in money. Potter may be rich in gold, but George is rich in something far more valuable - friends. It's a timely message that will always be needed. It's a story that only gets richer with the telling. And it's a film that seems to get better with age.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithhas a lot of wonderful people who care for him.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|It would be wise, if you are yet to couh up for this version, to wait for a spectacular version being released at the end of december.

B00002Z88D|2.0|First of all, I like Metallica.  I'm even a fan of Load and Reload, though I like the pre Black Album stuff better.  I've seen Metallica live, twice, and was blown away both times.  And I love symphony orchestras, you know, Mahler, Rachmaninov, Beethoven.  And i think Michael Kamen is a good conductor.   <br /> <br />That said, this was a dissapointing album, and it's all Metallica's fault.  First of all, the full orchestra is loud, buut to a point, and Metallica refused to match the volume of the orchestra.  As a result, only the most overblown histrionics of the orchestra match the relentless pounding of the band.   <br />And while I think the orchestral arrangements were often trite and sugary, I don't totally blame Michael Kamen.  Most of the newer songs are just hard rock songs and don't lend themselves to his brand of romantic-esque soundtrack type orchhestration.  And most annoyingly, Metallica refused to change in any way the arrangements of their own songs to accomodate the orchestra which is a typical arrogant rockstar move and pisses me off.  Don't buy this album, get their other live album or any studio album.  This is the worst thing Metallica has ever released.
B000BP86OG|4.0|Ah, the dreaded second album, the album that will separate the one-album-wonders and the bands with staying power. Having to have your second album be as good as your debut is hard enough, but it's going to be particularly challenging for The Darkness. With their ultra falsetto singer and screeching guitars, The Darkness are a complete throwback to the pre-Nirvana 70/80s. Some view The Darkness as a novelty act, and see the success of their debut album as an anomaly. So needless to say, The Darkness have a lot riding on their second album, it's either going to make them or break them.<br /><br />Much to the relief of the band and their fans, \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back\\" (2005) totally rocks. It has all the ingredients of a great old-school rock album: in-your-face head-banging arena rockers with kick-ass solos, a touch of the theatrics, and a balled or two that isn't to too corny. The Darkness have avoided the pitfalls of many sophomore slumps which include re-making the debut or letting creative aspirations run wild. \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back\\" is cut, more or less, from the same cloth as the debut. It's the same retro style of AC/DC meets Queen, but Roy Thomas Baker's production has given the songs an authentic touch of the theatrical operatic aspirations from which the band first strived for on their debut. The mellotrons, flugelhorns, sitars and saxophones added to the mix work well. At times, the channeling of Queen and the added orchestration may be a little overdone, but the album is still a thoroughly enjoyable listen.<br /><br />The critics have given \\"One Way Ticket to Hell and Back\\" fair reviews. But much like Queen, The Darkness could very well turn out to be a band of the people, rather than the critics. Fans of the debut, old-school metal, and Queen should be very pleased with this album.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've listened to almost nothing else since I bought this over a week ago, and am having to be careful not to blow out my car speakers.  Madonna's combination of great melodic hooks and killer dance beats is irresistible.  To those who have criticized the lyrics I say, \\"Don't search for life's meaning in a pop album\\".  It's dance music, fer crissakes!  I also liked the mix of old and new on \\"Isaac\\", I appreciate new amalgams (e.g. Enigma, Deep Forest).  <br /> <br />I buy few CD's because so much out there is stuffed with filler material not worth US$15, this album is quality from start to finish and is worth twice the price. <br /> <br />Madonna proves she still has it, and is the reigning Queen.
B0007US884|5.0|Come visit the worst-run hotel in the whole of western Europe (well, except for that place in Eastbourne...)<br /><br />In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television. Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total. The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'. Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the loveable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...).  Ballard Berkeley makes Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel. Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.<br /><br />From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain. Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!'<br /><br />In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze). The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.<br /><br />However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into. When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests. When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.<br /><br />'How does he make his living?' Basil protests. 'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...'<br /><br />This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares. He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.'<br /><br />As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference. Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference. Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise). One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).<br /><br />It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together. Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown.<br /><br />The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that). The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise).

068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes, tells the heartbreaking tale of a young boy who lived an impoverished life in Limerick. Growing up he hoped to go to America, where he would lead a good life, with a steady job, and money to give to his family. Throughout his story, which is told in a first person play-by-play fashion, McCourt gains the reader's trust by describing the bad things he did, such as \\"grabbing a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and running down Myrtle Avenue\\" (32), along with the good. While it is hard for me to relate to his story, since I have never had to deal with the death of a sibling, or a father who drinks away all of his paycheck, the way he describes his emotions makes it possible for anyone to connect. Everything about his story is real: from the questions he has about life, to the amazement he expresses when he first reads Shakespeare, which to him is like \\"having jewels in [his] mouth\\" (196), to the concerns he has about his sins. He has to deal with the internal conflict about his father's behaviors; he loves his father when they drink tea together in the morning, but when he has to fetch his drunken father from the bars, he cannot deal with emotional pain it causes him and his mother.  <br /> The story's chronological order gives the book a sense of organization, which makes some of the chaotic scenes easier to understand. Only 364 pages long, McCourt's memoir covers about nineteen years of his life. The scenes he chose seem to be about the most influential experiences or people in his life, and how they changed who he was as a person. Every character he describes is brought to life by an interesting detail that helps us understand what they meant to McCourt. Mikey Molloy, though McCourt often mocks him, is a sort of role model because of his knowledge of girls and his ability to do \\"anything his bloody well likes\\", such as eating \\"so many sweets and buns he threw up\\" (117). McCourt never has the ability to do thisbecause of his lack of money, but looks up to Molloy and enjoys his company. The detailed description in this book made me feel as if I'd been to Ireland and back, as well as greatly inspiring me to never stop trying to achieve my goals. <br />

B000BBOUU4|5.0|When Johnny Depp and Tim Burton team up to do a movie the results are usually fantastic: Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and to a lesser degree Sleepy Hollow. However, since Planet of the Apes, Burton's films have been missing that certain personal touch - the fascination with darkness mixed with a touch of wonderment - that used to make them so good. Fans keep hoping that his next movie will be a return to form but it hasn't happened yet. So, anticipation was high for Burton's latest, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Depp as none other than Willy Wonka. If anybody could successfully tap into Dahl's sensibilities it would be Burton, but could he equal Gene Wilder's memorable and much beloved take in 1971?<br /><br />Depp plays Wonka like a funky mix of the optimistic Ed Wood, the arrested development of Andy Kaufman and the flash of a kids show host. It's a typically off-kilter performance by Depp who proves that his recent foray into big budget movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) hasn't ruined his ability to create memorable characters. Depp's Wonka doesn't really like the kids with the exception of Charlie and barely conceals his contempt for them and this comes out in funny asides or amusing facial expressions from the rubber-faced Depp. There are also hints of deep regret and a damaged psyche as the film progresses and Wonka's troubled past is fleshed out (this is the major point where the film deviates from the book) explaining his motivations. As he did in Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp plays it broad creating his own Wonka that isn't better or worse than Wilder's - just different.<br /><br />Burton wisely doesn't try to remake the Wilder film but goes back to Dahl's book. This is the first film since Sleepy Hollow to feel like a truly authentic Tim Burton film as he really connects with the material in a big way. It's almost as if reconnecting with Depp on this film (and Corpse Bride) has helped the filmmaker find his way back to what made his films so interesting in the first place. Let's hope that this is the beginning of a move back to more personal films like Ed Wood and a distancing of director-for-hire projects like Apes and Big Fish.<br /><br />Included is the obligatory theatrical trailer.<br /><br />\\"Attack of the Squirrels\\" shows how an animal wrangler trained the squirrels for a scene in the movie. For most of the squirrels, it took 2,000 repetitions to learn a specific task.<br /><br />\\"Fantastic Mr. Dahl\\" takes a look at author Roald Dahl with vintage archival footage of the man and testimony from his friends, family and collaborators.<br /><br />\\"Becoming Oompa-Loompa\\" examines how they took actor Deep Roy and transformed him into an army of Oompa-Loompas thanks to CGI. Of all the actors, he had to work the hardest playing so many different roles that was then augmented by special effects.<br /><br />\\"Making the Mix\\" is a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, including the origins of the project, the changes they made from the book, the casting process (including the kids), Danny Elfman's score and how he approached such a daunting task, costume and production design and finally the special effects. Thankfully, Burton relied as much on practical sets and miniatures as possible with the CGI done only to compliment the real sets.<br /><br />Also included are several interactive games.<br /><br />\\"Oompa-Loompa Dance\\" takes you through two dances from the movie and then you have to try and keep an Oompa-Loompa dancing by following the corresponding moves.<br /><br />In \\"The Bad Nut\\" you have to help Wonka's squirrels sort good and bad nuts with only three tries to get it right.<br /><br />\\"The Inventing Machine\\" allows you to make your own candy and test it on an Oompa-Loompa.<br /><br />Finally, there is the \\"Search for the Golden Ticket\\" which allows you to help the five children find their respective ticket througha series of games.spective ticket through a series of games.
0393327655|5.0|Sam talks about what many of us are thinking from Time to time. He points out areas of the Koran and the Bible that simply have no basis in morality. He reinforces what I've been thinking for a long time - that you can pick and chose what you want from the bible or the Koran and show good in the name of God or show a vengeful and angry God that tells us to kill those that don't believe or commit sins that aren't even a crime in our modern society. He also brings to light the reason for suicide bombers that our Government overlooks.  <br /> <br />Most Christian bible thumpers and followers of Islam have never completely read their respective books of holiness. Their beliefs of nontangible craziness and ritual can ruin lives and often does. Organized religion is man-made. As such it's not the inspired word of God. People kill for God and their religous beliefs. That's the final word here. This book tells us this in print. Most educated persons already know it but we don't write it down. We don't even speak about it much because it's so taboo to do so all over the world. You can spew your religion and force it on others these days but you can't question it. <br /> <br />The point here is that morality is within the person and not in dogmatic fundamentalist teachings.  <br />

B00005RYL2|5.0|Has anyone noticed that in the very moment that Mercury sings \\"When love must die\\" (in \\"Who wants to live forever\\") you see Heather's face - and she is an old woman? This is magical filmmaking. This is just one of the many little gems in this movie, which is essentially about the loneliness of a man trapped in immortality - a fate he didn't choose and has trouble to accept. The imagery is at times like a video clip (due to Russel Mulcahy's past) but sometimes it radiates a melancholy which I believe is without parallel in other action movies. If you don't like it the first time around - watch it again anyways. Listen to the interplay of image and score (Queen!!) - this is the major strength of the movie.
0307276902|4.0|Not just because Frey starts a new paragraph after each sentence or sometimes word, but from the first sentence, he's captured you, the reader and even the end of the book just CAN'T BE THE END!  Like most talented authors, Frey ends each chapter on a mystery that you know will be solved in the next chapter, so you keep reading into endless hours.  And although his narrations are intentionally repetitive and sometimes seemingly a page filler, the captured will see this as his desperate attempt to conquer drug addiction.  It will even make a lifelong sober soul lose all sense of innocence and selfhood within the dark and deadly confines of Frey's alcohol and drug abuse.  After he meets fellow rehab patients from all walks of life, each offering a different magnitude of hope and guidance...and the psychological and emotional reunion of his family and childhood memories -- your shackles will slowly begin to unlock and you only dream to feel as free as a rehabilitated drug addict. <br /> <br />With that being said, I have to say I bought into the hype.  And a successful book becomes so for a reason and after he wrote his continuing book, I read it immediately.  Without trying to comment too much on Frey's difficult attempt to recapature us, it made me realize that Pieces was just a marvelous story.  As if you bought the audio tape or heard the story being told and it would be just as amusing.  Because frankly, Frey has no literary talent as proven in Leonard.  And perhaps my foot is already in my mouth, but I don't see him as becoming the next big thing in literature.  He will make lots of money on Pieces, no doubt, but only because he had a great story that only he can tell.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|I suspect most people end up viewing \\"The Brown Bunny\\" because of the controversy surrounding it, because writer-director-actor Vincent Gallo's 2003 film is not exactly the sort of film you are going to stumble across.  If you are a fan of Chloë Sevigny or Cheryl Tiegs that might be the case, but given how earnestly the promotion of this film courts the controversy that will almost invariably be the conduit by which most people come to see it.  The teaser trailer has the scathing line from \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" that \\"No one in America will ever see a frame of this film,\\" shows us only Gallo in profile driving his van, lists the main actors, and then fades to white with the final enticement \\"ADULTS ONLY.\\"  The other, second, trailer should be avoided because it gives away the twist at the end of the movie and what is the point of having a twist if you see it coming?  Rethinking the movie in terms of that new knowledge is a retroactive experience, or something that should be reserved for a second viewing, and not anything that should spoil the first viewing.<br /><br />However, the controversy that is being stoked is somewhat disingenuous at this point because after the disastrous screening of \\"The Brown Bunny\\" at Cannes, which initiated the angry exchange between Gallo and the critic Roger Ebert, the director re-edited his film and cut out 26 minutes of the film.  So this version is not the original version, and apparently everyone who has seen both versions (including Ebert) finds this version to be superior.  One choice example can explain why: when Gallo's character, motorbike racer Bud Clay visits the Bonneville Salt Flats he takes out his bike and rides off into the distance.  Originally there was a shot of him coming back as well, which could well produce a laugh at the rather pointlessness of the exercise.  See Bud go.  See Bud come back.  But by simply letting Bud disappear in the distance before resuming his cross-country trek gives the scene more weight.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film Bud finishes a motorcycle race, shot in long distance so that sometimes the sound fades away, and then decides to head for California to race.  Before he goes he does two things.  First, he persuades the young girl at the convenience store where he buys gas to come with him, only to abandon her when they stop at her house for her to pick up a few things.  Second, he visits an elderly couple and tries to get them to remember that he used to live next door.  Together these two scenes provide our initial oblique cues as to what this journey is about.  But it is hard to know if a character is running away or running towards something or someone if you do not know the reference point, and therein lies the maddening quality of watching this film.<br /><br />\\"The Brown Bunny\\" is what I would most decidedly call an art film, based mainly on Gallo's preference for leaving the camera in place and letting action take place on the other side of the car window with the characters not always adequately captured by the frame.  However, this style matches the substance of the film, because these moments in Bud's trip across the country are neither clearly seen nor completely understood.  Consequently it is not surprising that many people would give up on watching the film because they find it to be so tedious, while others will look at the same thing and find it indulgent.<br /><br />I picked up on a key clue regarding the twist when Daisy (Savigny) appears in Bud's hotel room, but I did not see it coming and I have to say that it was more Gallo's performance at the end that bothered me that the sex or the final revelation.  He says so little for most of the film that when we finally get to the point where he talks he whispers and then he whines.  The former is unsettling once you understand what he is saying to Daisy and since the latter sets up a jarring contrast between their tones that reflects the dynamic.  So if a film intends to provoke an emotional response adn does so, that would speak to some level of success.<br /><br />Finally, is the sex scene gratuitous?  No, because throughout his journey Bud has essentially been saving himself for this moment.  Is the graphic depiction necessary?  I would argue yes, provided that it is indeed a prosthetic, because then I can see it as fitting into the twist.  If not, then it is an example of gross indulgence.  Despite the claims of some that it was real I think the fact there is no difference between the before and after shots (which may be a telling clue in itself), and that Gallo avoids rendering the whole question moot by showing the point of connection, confirms my suspicions.  More importantly, if it is really real then it destroys the illusion Gallo works so hard to craft in the climactic scene of his film.  \\"The Brown Bunny\\" gives you plenty to think about, if you are so inclined to try to unravel it all and come to your own conclusions.s so, that would speak to some level of success.

B0009MAO46|5.0|A timeless tale. Computer animation has advanced much in ten years, but \\"Toy Story\\" is still a true masterpiece for the entire family. A true visual treat to watch and featuring a strongly absorbing plot.<br /><br />For anyone that might not know yet, just a quick rundown --- Woody, a cowboy, is a toy that has been a boy, Andy's favorite for many years. Sharing Andy's room with a whole collection of other toys, he's become a sort of unofficial leader. Everything changes, though, when a birthday party for Andy brings a new toy. Buzz Lightyear has wings, glows in the dark, has an electronic voicebox and even karate chop action. To top off, he doesn't even know he's a toy! Pretty soon, it seems like Buzz has become Andy's favorite and Woody is getting left behind. Then, circumstances come together so that Woody and Buzz have to work together to save their own lives and be reunited with Andy. The film features several great songs --- \\"You've Got a Friend in Me\\" (and closing credits version), \\"Strange Things\\" and \\"I Will Go Sailing No More.\\" (All composed and performed by Randy Newman, with Lyle Lovett joining on the closing credits version of \\"Friend in Me.\\")<br /><br />For those enjoying the movie anew, or for the first time, the DVD experience is great. It features enhanced picture quality and new 5.1 Surround Sound. The movie is fully digitally mastered and also featured French and Spanish audiotracks, as well as subtitles and close-captioning. And, to top it all off, there's also a commentary track with several of the movie staff, as well as many others popping in briefly throughout.

0441172717|5.0|Before this book, the only knowledge I had of Dune was the 1980's movie that featured actors Sting and Patrick Stewart (of Jean-Luc Picard fame). I did not think it was a very good movie. But it seems the people who know sci-fi literature really believe Dune to be among the best. So, I decided to give it a shot.  <br /> <br />This book is a real tremendous work. It's not perfect, but it is so deep and intricate that I found myself lost in it. Frank Herbert really attached a good portion of philosophy in this book, and this is clearly seen in how he lets you into the thought-life of all his characters (good and bad). Furthermore each chapter begins with an excerpt from future fictional books that read like spiritual scripture. I found myself reading these a couple times over to make sure I understood what he was saying. I didn't necessarily agree with the conclusions, but you shouldn't care what I think about that. You should know that his thoughts are provocative and will make you think.  <br /> <br />The story itself is beautiful. It's tough in the beginning because this world, its people and culture are so foreign. As you read you find terms that you cannot yet define. Hang in there though, the mystique does get explained.  <br /> <br />The characters and their interactions and motivations are entirely believable. And having access to their thoughts is such a good idea, and it's unfortunate that those portions of the book could not be easily translated into movie-form. <br /> <br />There are some things that I would have liked. The ending of this book jumps around a bit and seemed a little hurried. There's a big climax coming and then main characters are killed, but you, as the reader, find out about it secondhand. I would have liked to read the action from those scenes. <br /> <br />It is also easy to get lost in all the cultural nuances of the Fremen and Bene Gesserit. Sometimes I knew what they were talking about, and sometimes I just couldn't get it. I would read some paragraphs over a few times, and then just move on. Generally I could get at least a basic-level understanding of what was being talked about. <br /> <br />All in all, I've enjoyed this book more than any I can remember from the last few years of reading. It's great and you just want to keep going. Highly recommended.  <br />

I was sure the band would come out with both guns blazing, but so much of this sounds like outtakes from Sheer Heart Attack.  What gives? No one great song like the 1ST LP.  Next time around fellows; ditch the producer, crank the guitars up to 11, get rid of queen crap, and friggin' rock like we know you can...please
B00005JNZJ|1.0|This film was painfull to watch and through the whole thing I could not help myself from thinking, \\"Why didn't I listen to those who warned me!?! <br />There is nothing of value here folks. Move along...
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I remember the day when Madonna was a trendsetter. Now she seems to be the follower, but getting a bit lost. With the exceptions of \\"Jump\\" and \\"Future Lovers\\", this CD is a total waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid Madonna fan. I just feel she sold out here for a quick buck (since her movie career is nothing). It would have been nice to have had a \\"dancefloor\\" CD that contained songs to which you could actually dance. \\"You Can Dance\\" was a remix CD, but at least it showed some variety and originality. On this endeavour, Madonna sounds like Kylie Minogue...only less focused and singing off-key (as usual).
1591391105|2.0|The book is well organized and has some general ideas that are worthwhile, but also have been expressed in most other books of this genre.  The generalities are not developed enough to help the reader really lay out a plan for the first 90 days.  Each chapter begins with a brief anecdote of someone who either succeeded or failed in a new role.  I found myself wishing the author had spent more time on these examples, rather than simply using a couple of paragraphs as an introduction to the chapter.   <br />I recommend \\"You're in Charge:  Now What\\" over this book.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Honestly I have never been a Madonna fan, and the only album I really liked from her was The Ray of Light. <br /> <br />When I first heard this album, from the beginning of the first song, I was literally enchanted by it. She uses really great dance music with catchy melodies, cool metallic beats, modern ethnic and electronica fusion and you literally see a rainbow of color when you put this CD on and close your eyes. <br /> <br />This is by far the kind of cd that makes you happy and up-beat when you have it on. I was really impressed how every song was better than the last, and you can certainly listen to the whole album twice, and then keep looking forward to the next time you can put it on. <br /> <br />Overall, Exellent stuff!
B000BOH8XW|3.0|Shakira is my favourite artist ever, I'm from Peru and I've listened to her since the very beginning. With the released of early 2005 hit album Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 critics told her she might be in the right path. As we know Laundry Service was a good pop material but not such outstanding, with hits like Whenever Wherever or Underneath Your Clothes Shakira showed her style to the world and seems like the world like it. This english sophomore LP gets the wrong path, though Shakira experiment with her music she risks too much.     Now she's plannin a new revised version for releasing more hip song Hips Don't Lie. Maybe she heard out her album wasn't so great guess so. But so soon. Guess it just didn't work    Havin' such success with La Tortura she also should incluyed some song with arabic - latin style that is missing here. I feel kind of upset coz she's already forgetting what she does best. She also believed that clever lyrics in english means said something really complicated or try eventually to say some 'smart' word.  I though that part of her music that always like was her lyrical talent that lost in translation. Thinkin' here would change she take so seriously what I said that she still impressed me with such lost of imagination. She was called Alanis Morrisete of Latin Music once, now Alanis should be upset to be compared to her.     Obviously her talent is still here. Such as 'Don't Bother' 'How Do You Do' and 'Costume Makes The Clown' contains some kick of music and lyrically great. Her voice is gettin' released out of the body. But she still miss something in any international super star, balance. This album have too many rock pop songs no balance in here. Have no dance songs in here. Timor get closed to it. She also touched political statement which is so simple that you don't get why is she talking something so simple about something that is really complicated.    I though Translated songs should become really Shakira best enemy, here she tries to adaptate (not translate) songs into english but get a little bit unmagical. Also have a big complain, I enjoyd too much Fijacion Oral (read my review about the songs on it) and though English Version would get kind of A+ but isn't it right? Shakira did wrong ??? no, she's just thinking that be a smart artists means sing rock, have complicate lyrics and have no belly dance on stage. Now, she's famous for movin' her hips more than for her music.     Think Twice before get this. Listen to previews, pliz then you wouldn't lose no money. If U R a colector then get it. But if you're a fan be sure you really like it then adquire it.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This is interesting, I'm sure those who are put off by traditional Hollywood productions, which do get old, will love this. I might be crude but I found it a bit too subtle. <br />Chatlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson was a charming character, someone you wish you could be best friends with, but she still looks the 19 years old girl she is. She does not look like the 25 year old married woman she plays. <br />During the whole movie all you can think about is, will Bill Murray and Johansson hook up, will they? Well, Dont hold your breath buddy... <br />This love story might really need some simple translation, into human terms, because it's just too subtle. I felt like i needed a microscope or a giger couter to get in on the action. <br /> <br />This was a nice movie, really. But I doubt I'd watch it again.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|It's hard to believe that \\"Born to Run\\" was released 30 years ago, wow. This is indeed the perfect way to pay tribute to that monumental album: a remastered edition, plus not one, but two  DVDs. As to the remastered edition, it sounds very nice but not all that noticably better then what was already available. The second DVD contains a lot of great background materials and documentaries, but truth be told, I doubt that I will watch that DVD a lot.<br /><br />The reason to have this is of course the concert DVD of the 1975 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon. If you haven't been to that venue, it is quite small, but of course at that time Bruce was not the superstar he would become not long after. The Amazon editorial review describes Bruce as \\"pensive and joyless\\". Huh? Have they seen the same concert that I saw? Bruce is super-energetic, running all over the place, and clearly enjoying himself and the occasion. Interesting is that Bruce doesn't start playing guitar until the 5th song into the set (\\"She's the One\\"). My favorite moments include \\"Spirits in the Night\\", \\"Born to Run\\", with a refreshing sound (of course it was a brand new song then), and \\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\", but truth be told, this DVD is a delight from beginning to end. A true time-capsule from 30 years ago, and yes, this DVD will get repeated playing! Highly recommended!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|If you are expecting an album full of John's normal pop-style tunes then you will be disappointed.  If you can appreciate music being performed by someone who truely loves it then this is the album for you.  John left the pop world at the height of his career to do what he loved.  I think this was a very brave move and his confidence and love of the music shines in this enjoyable album.
B000268QB2|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this cd in full. It's an enjoyable album from start to finish. The songs have nice hooks and dreamy lyrics and vocals, making for an enjoyable listen. It's not the most typical thing I would hear in my collection, but I'm glad it has a place in it. There isn't one bad song on here. Just a great listen from start to finish, for me at least!
B00005JO1J|5.0|I did not see the play and all I knew about this film going into it was the song \\"Seasons of Love.\\" At first, it was kinda rough going after seeing/hearing the title song, but the film really grew on me for what it is. Yeah, I admittedy was thrown off a bit with some of the subject matter which has been discussed to death here, but I was not offended. It strikes me as a testament to the human spirit that this group of social outcasts, scorned by most people bond toggether as friends and as a family against their inevitable ends.    Perhaps it's just as well that I didn't see the original play and did not have it to compare with the film. I love this movie, although I wouldn't take the kiddies to it.    Now that the DVD is finally out and I snapped it up right away, some additional commentary is necessary. The deleted scenes are quite interesting, as is often the case with a movie that you like. The alternate ending is triumphant, if a tad cornball and it's just as well, considering Angel's character, that they didn't use it (I won't spoil it, see and you'll understand). But it's still interesting as a bonus feature. The documentary about Jonathan Larson is very revealing, if a tad overlong (the behind the scenes stuff about the film would have worked better as a seperate feature) and overall, the entire package holds together well (including some of the original stage cast memebers who did not return for the movie. I like the fact they weren't excluded and we get to compare them with Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms), making the \\"Rent\\" DVD an essential and worthwhile purchase.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|I just found out about this set and I thought there might be new extras or that amazing as it would be that these are the very original versions BUT ALAS...NO! <br /> <br /> From the other previews here it sounds like some fans are complaining about this set and/or accusing Lucas of being greedy, asking more of your money. Well, if you have done your research you will discover that these are probably (they're not out yet) the exact same discs as last years set without the 4th bonus disc. Its the holiday season right? People are buying gifts now so it would be safe to assume that this 'plain' set will mainly be bought as a gift so that you save money by buying this cheaper set to give away. On the other hand this set does seems a bit pointless, why not spend that little bit extra to get the extra bonus disc?  <br /> <br /> If people think Lucas is being greedy then what about the Sin City DVD? That one came out in the summer with 1 crappy featurette only as the studio knew it would bring out a multi-disc version in a few months time to get more money from impatient sheep. Unless you got caught out I have no pity for people who foolishly and knowingly gave their money to the greedy, corporate, fat cats. At least Lucas is doing it the other way round, he's releasing this plain version over 1 year after the 'definitive' set and so giving customers a choice. <br /> <br /> As for this set I was hoping it would be the original versions that came out last century (that sounds old!) but they're not. Actually I reckon last years set should have come with 3 versions of each film rather than one. The other 2 would be the original theatrical versions and the 1997(?) special editions that I actually prefer. Here's hoping they come out on DVD one day!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|OK, so those folks across the pond were in on this before most of us, but now that we've got it, wow are we lucky. This has to be near the top of my \\"Best of 2005\\" list because it's somehow different, perfectly produced and includes ten totally diverse songs that make this first effort quite amazing. Starting with \\"High\\" the opening song, and followed by the radio single, \\"You're Beautiful\\" and right through to the tenth song, \\"No Bravery\\", this CD is first rate. Only down side - the F word on the non-radio version of \\"You're Beautiful\\", which honestly works better using the word flying as the F word anyway. It's more natural and doesn't seem so forced. I use the F word, but frankly it just wasn't necessary here. Bought the Clean version of the CD after having the explicit copy..........suggest you do the same! James Blunt is the real thing!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has to be one of the best \\"new\\" (from the past 20 years) rock bands out there. They combine elements of alt-rock, metal, and most recently on this album, prog rock to form they're own unique style that is in a whole other universe from these crappy emo bands they are sharing the present rock scene with. They have consistently gotten better with each new album, and this is the best yet. Complex, yet loud enough to head bang too, in one album. Very original, you won't find another band like them. Great album, if you are sick of all the 3rd generation Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan emo crap that is ruining rock, get this album and maybe you'll realize rock isn't dead after all.
0395389496|2.0|When I ordered this book, I had never read it, but I had read the reviews and believed it was a must have for my nearly 3 year old son who is becoming excited about Christmas for the first time.  I read it with happy anticipation, loving the warm tone and vivid descriptions on the trip to the North Pole and back, including when the boy finds the bell wrapped under the tree with the cute note from Santa.  However, from that point forward, I hated it.  His parents couldn't hear it, later his sister couldn't, etc., because they were not \\"true believers\\"?!  Ugh!  Yuck too!  To me, Christmas is about love, generosity, inclusiveness, a celebration of renewal, life, all children AND their families, not about celebrating being part of an elite group of true believers.  I hated it; and I'm thrilled to have gotten rid of it.
B00007KLJJ|4.0|As a novel, the Four Feathers is an extremely introspective and psychological work, which obviously poses significant problems for whoever intends to adapt it. In reality there is very little action in the book, apart from a very quick knife fight, which again poses problems. I would hazard a guess that the Four Feathers' reputation as a \\"Victorian epic\\" is based more in the earlier renditions of the film, rather than in the novel. This new version departs from the novel in a number of ways, but I would argue that this is its' strength, rather than weakness. The filmmakers obviously saw potential in the setting and basic plot of the story, but decided to take it in their own direction. Some would call that blasphemy, but a film is not a book. Maybe the filmmakers looked at the Four Feathers, and didn't WANT to make a movie that was as close to the book as humanly possible. It's their prerogative- because they aren't rewriting the novel-they're making the movie.   <br />Adapting a novel into a film is always tricky, especially when the novel was written a century ago. A lot can change in a hundred years. Still, enough can remain the same, that many fans of the original will nail you to the wall for every inaccuracy and alteration. In the case of \\"the Four Feathers\\" there are so many ways you can criticize the new film, that it's almost laughable. Read one or two of the negative reviews below, and you'll see complaints about plot holes, deflated characters, anti-imperialism, and failing to pay homage to the original 4 or 3 or 11 other versions that exist(I've lost count, because I obviously don't care). I'm not going to talk about what \\"the Four Feathers\\" isn't, but rather what it IS. <br /> It is a film with breathtaking cinematography, which displays the haunting and forbidding landscape of the Sudan, from the rolling dunes of sand, to the blasted wastes. The film offers a look at a cross section of Imperialism, through the eyes of those affected- from the soldiersenforcing the rule to the people under it. I would disagree with those reviewers who see it as a dig against British tradition alone, but more against the traditions and beliefs that fuelled and supported Imperialism as a whole. <br /> In closing, I'd just like to mention one of the many departures from the book that I felt strengthened the film, was the portrayal of Harry's reasons for refusing to fight. In the book, Harry has already done a tour of duty in India, and it is clear his reasons for refusing, is the thought of leaving Ethne. In the film, he makes some comment about \\"What does the Queen have to do with Africa\\" but in reality, that is a ploy, I feel. I think that Harry really is a coward, at least in the Victorian sense. He does not want to fight in war, because he is afraid. But when it comes down to protecting and proving himself to his friends, Harry is able to overcome his fears. Not bad. Not bad at all. <br />
B0001AP158|5.0|I cannot believe people do not like the 'twist' this CD represents. I rented it and feel it is a must to add to my collection. I have an 8-year old son who loves it more than I. Bon Jovi is truly the only rockin' band who could do this with such class and finesse. The people who reviewed this badly need to reexamine what music and true talent are because this is a strong combination of both. Kudos guys and please continue doing what you are doing both on stage and off. There is truly no one out there who can do it better.
0446677450|5.0|I am not surprised at the 1 star reviews posted here. In fact, I expected a lot more. Kiyosaki goes against the norm. He tells us thate verything we were taught was normal, i s in fact holding us back from achieving our dreams. <br /> <br />He tells us that education will keep you broke. That is standard education. What you say? How could that be true? We were always taught by our parents that to succeed we  need to get good grades in grade school, then go to Junior High School and get good grades so we could go to High School and then go on to college and  get good grades so we could get a good job. <br /> <br />We do that and what is the result? We find that we were lied to. That all education does is make us good employees and helps us make our employer rich. And we find out that our employers could care less about us.  <br /> <br />We also find out how much more there is to learn to really succeed and not just get by. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki tells us the story about his Rich Dad and his Poor Dad. We find that Kiyosaki's real dad his Poor Dad was a victim on standard education and beliefs and died at a young age, broke and embarrassed. <br /> <br />We then learn what Kiyosaki's Rich Dad (his friends dad) taught him and this is what made Kiyosaki's Rich Dad and Kiyosaki and Kiyosaki students wealthy. HINT: It wasn't a college degree or working for an employer. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also tells us that a home is not an asset to you, but a liability. A lot of people have a problem with this. But check your financial statement. If you have a mortgage, your house is listed as a liability to you and an asset to your bank. Even if your home is paid off there is still maintenance that can eat you alive. Kiyosaki warns that too many people are trying to keep up with the Joneses and end up with a alligator that eats them alive. It's called your home. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki is also pro business as in self employment. Esepcially in Cash Flow Quadrant, Kiyosaki covers the four quadrants and explains why no matter where you are right now, you can start to create wealth. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also gets a lot of heat for recommending full service as opposed to discount brokers and even makes joke by indicating that many brokers get their name because they make you broker. This may be a joke, but it is not funny and it is true. Most brokers are out to sell you their Soupd'jour-The stock of the day. Whatever their managers tell them to sell and makes them the most money. Full service brokers will work for your interests and in the long run, cost you LESS not MORE. <br /> <br />Some cheap tabloids have taken some cheap shots at Kiyosaki just like they have others like Suze Orman. It's not working. There is also a tabloid like website run by someone that nobody who is successful has ever heard of. Beware of tabloid-like websites that purport to tell you the truth about successful people like Kiyosaki and then want to sell you something and inundaunt you with a mass of spam once they get your email address. And then they sell your name to other tabloid-like sites. These people are just pests and predators. HINT: Never use your main email address when you go to these sites. <br /> <br />Overall Rich Dad Poor Dad is excellent. I am glad that the parasites and predators on the naive are still attcaking Kiyosaki. I am only surprised that there are not more of them. I am not surprised to see that it is not working though. Rich Dad Poor Dad remains a best seller now for 9 years. The best selling financial book ever. 10 years from now it will still be selling while the pests and predators will still be writing garbage while they stay \\"Johnny Lunch-Buckets\\" and float from job to job to job. <br /> <br />Good luck! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is a great album. The lyrics, the music...everything! Every single song on this CD from beginning to end (which is about 45 minutes) is pleasure to my ears as is Fijacion Oral Vol. 1. Put both CD's in a CD changer and add the random setting. That's fun! I just wish she would have given us two new songs instead of English renditions of \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" and \\"Dia Especial\\" from Fijacion Oral Vol. 1. Shakira, my favorite artist, is a very talented. I just hope it doesn't take 4 more years for new material! God willing I'll be 28 years old by then. Goodness!
B000AP04FG|3.0|I was disappointed with this one as it features the two current pretty faces in Hollywood playing two married people (who are hired killers and neither one has figured it out) who are pitted against each other. Plenty of hardware, a few clever sight gags but as many films do, it makes killing look like some form of entertainment and only the bad guys (in this case, black-clad SWAT killers) get killed while the two main stars only get a few nicks and cuts. The final scene is a scene torn from Butch Cassiday and the Sundance Kid. Rent it but I would suggest purchasing it.
B000002MFN|4.0|\\"Erotica\\" was the beginning of 90's Madonna, and really the start of her second phase if you will. Good-bye to the sounds of the 80's, and hello to an even more mature and sexy Madonna. Considering all the singles that came from this, and the quality of the album in general, it seems rather underrated. The title track and \\"Fever\\" were huge songs, and I think \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" is easily one of her best dance-tracks. Two minor hits, and my personal favorites on the disc, are \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Rain\\", both excellent in my opinion, yet neither made her \\"GHV2\\". The only faults I really find are in the 2-3 filler tracks, and that the album is really long, 75 minutes. Still, after \\"Ray Of Light\\" I think it's the best of her second decade, and slightly better than the following album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Even if you got this for only the five \\"hits\\", it's essential Madonna, and a bit erotic.
1594200653|4.0|\\"Postwar\\" by Tony Judt is a mammoth (960) opus written in text-book style, except for the odd and disappointing fact that no facts were footnoted. Beyond this decision, the actual facts presented present a view of post-WW II Europe that is balanced and detailed. Its coverage of East and West, and its discussion of the role of the US will create discussion for years to come.<br /><br />Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\\", \\"Soul Physicians,\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\"
B000005ALN|4.0|\\"Older\\" may be an album of his that gets lost in the mix, but if you're a fan of his in any way, it's well worth the listen. Despite taking six years to release, it's typical George Michael, and therefore wonderful. Included are the upbeat songs like \\"FastLove\\" and \\"Star People\\", as well as the slower and moving ones such as \\"You Have Been Loved\\" and \\"Jesus To A Child\\". I also enjoy \\"The Strangest Thing\\" and \\"To Be Forgiven\\". Even though George has been a star for 20 years now, I still feel he is slightly underrated as an artist. Each album of his leaves me impressed. If this album doesn't hook you right away, give it another try sometime, perhaps when you're \\"Older\\".
B00003CXCW|5.0|This film was the Performance of Gloria Swanson's Career, Flim Noir at it's best.  My favorite scene in the film was when William Holden's characters parks his depressing post war 1946 Plymouth in Norma Desmond's garage and finds her 1932 Isotta Fraschini Laundulette touring car. A testament to who depressing the car market had become in 1950. We also see a young Jack Webb playing Holden's best friend in several scenes,  noted Hollywood reporter  Hedda Hopper, and legendary Silent era director Erich von Stroheim as Max,  whose claim to fame was the 1924 Silent classic GREED. The star of the film is Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond and Swanson gives the performance of her career. This film is a must see for lovers of the old slient films.
B000002H2Z|4.0|Picking a favorite Cure album is like choosing between air or water, hard to do. This might not be my absolute #1, but \\"Head On The Door\\" is the first Cure album I really knew note for note, and completely absorbed. What I love about it has been said before, it's mid-way through their best years, and is as diverse as it is excellent. It's got the hits like \\"In Between Days\\" and \\"Close To Me\\", the odd-balls like \\"The Blood\\" and \\"Screw\\", and the moody pieces like \\"Kyoto Song\\" and \\"Sinking\\". Their next album \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" might one-up this disc, but \\"Head On The Door\\" is still 37 minutes of primo Cure. It was the soundtrack to my pizza-delivery years.
B00005JNZJ|2.0|Never has so much work been put into a film that means so little.<br /><br />Aeon (Charlize Theron) is an elite member of a group called the Monicans. Due to a large-scale epidemic, there is only one city left on the planet ruled by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who heads a council of elders (of sorts), including his brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller). Everyone in the cast seems to have been chosen because they spell their names in an odd way. Perhaps this is the director's subconscious method of evoking the future. The Monicans realize that although everything may look good, they are living in a police state and nefarious people lurk in the background, extracting citizens without cause. Aeon receives her latest instructions from Handler (Frances McDormand): The Monicans want her to assassinate Goodchild. Aeon has good reason to hate the Chairman as her sister was just murdered, for being a suspected member of the Monicans. The Monicans have received secret information that he will be vulnerable at a certain time. Just as she is about to kill him, Goodchild recognizes Aeon and asks \\"Catherine?\\" causing her to lose her concentration.<br /><br />\\"Aeon Flux\\", directed by Karyn Kusama, whose only other film was the independent film \\"Girlfight\\", is an interesting film to look at, to a point, but it is extremely simplistic and hollow.<br /><br />The film is based on a series of graphic novels and an animated series, which I am not familiar with. A friend told me that in these original incarnations, Aeon is repeatedly killed and then cloned, to keep coming back and back. If this is true, it seems rather pointless. How can we root for Aeon, the hero, if she is so completely unsuccessful that she repeatedly gets killed? Thankfully, the filmmakers have changed this when adapting for the big screen. Charlize Theron's interpretation of the character is an extremely well-trained assassin who seems to have every skill she needs at her fingertips. This makes her the sort of tough, no nonsense woman you are probably expecting from the commercials and trailers.<br /><br />But she is ultimately too tough. Aeon never shows any emotion. Even when her sister is killed, a tear barely falls before she is off running, kicking, or killing guards with a quick jerk on their necks. Note to filmmakers: They don't all have to be cold-hearted and stone-faced killers in the future. This would be an acceptable trait for the lead character if anyone else showed any emotion. Occasionally, a tear makes its way down a cheek, but the person remains cold and immobile. But no one does. I understand all of this stoicism is meant to evoke the sterile, antiseptic feel of the future, but we're beyond that. We can see a character show some emotion in the future.<br /><br />Watching Charlize Theron kick box her way through a series of attackers is fun, but it gets repetitive. Real fast. She gets a scratch here and a cut there, but nothing seems to slow her down. She just keeps running or kicking or hitting, etc. Yawn. When there is little or no evidence that she will ever be waylaid by any injury, any suspense generated by the situation quickly evaporates. Many of these futuristic fighting machines are just that, machines. They never appear vulnerable, never show emotion and simply move from one target to the next, trying to achieve some goal. What the filmmakers are missing is that the character, their futuristic fighting machine, needs to have something for us, the audience to identify with. Give the machine some trait or other that lets us in, shows us they are vulnerable. This is one of the reasons The Terminator is such a great character. In \\"The Terminator\\", he is originally the villain. Yet, he is also vulnerable, he can be slowed down. In the sequel, he becomes the protector and even though he isn't the most emotive guy in the world, we see that he cares about Sarah and John Connor. This made him a character we could identify with, yes, even though he is a robotwho kills, leaving a path of destruction.<br /><br />The design of \\"Aeon Flux\\" is interesting and easily the best thing about the film. It occurred to me that director Kusama probably grew up watching films like \\"Logan's Run\\" and similar mid-70s attempts at depicting the future, and really enjoyed them. This is her homage to these films. The film looks and feels like \\"Run\\", but made with better special effects. Buildings have sleek shapes, built in concrete. Clothes are strange, made primarily of leather and latex and cover odd parts of the body. Food is interesting. It looks as though they took a mixture of the oddest looking things they could find in real life and interspersed them throughout, adding a touch of interest to a strange bleak landscape. At one point, Aeon's sister is cutting into a star fruit, which is supposed to be a futuristic thing, but exists in this day and age. I have heard that much of the film was shot in Germany, presumably to use some of their slightly surrealistic architecture as the basis for this futuristic world.<br /><br />Is this attempt at creating a new world enough to warrant your time and money? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The film is well-produced, but it is not well-written or directed well.

Without this human touch, these films will always feel like hollow shells of moviemaking excess.is a robot who kills, leaving a path of destruction. <br /> <br />The design of \\"Aeon Flux\\" is interesting and easily the best thing about the film. It occurred to me that director Kusama probably grew up watching films like \\"Logan's Run\\" and similar mid-70s attempts at depicting the future, and really enjoyed them. This is her homage to these films. The film looks and feels like \\"Run\\", but made with better special effects. Buildings have sleek shapes, built in concrete. Clothes are strange, made primarily of leather and latex and cover odd parts of the body. Food is interesting. It looks as though they took a mixture of the oddest looking things they could find in real life and interspersed them throughout, adding a touch of interest to a strange bleak landscape. At one point, Aeon's sister is cutting into a star fruit, which is supposed to be a futuristic thing, but exists in this day and age. I have heard that much of the film was shot in Germany, presumably to use some of their slightly surrealistic architecture as the basis for this futuristic world. <br /> <br />Is this attempt at creating a new world enough to warrant your time and money? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The film is well-produced, but it is not well-written or directed well. Until the filmmakers can begin to create futuristic characters that experience some believable emotion, which can make us feel for them, don't bother. Without this human touch, these films will always feel like hollow shells of moviemaking excess. <br />
B00005JNZJ|4.0|After reading reviews of this movie, I was skeptical that it was going to be any good.  Some of the ones I saw said the movie was boring.  I have to disagree.  This film had an interesting and coherant storyline, mixed with well done action scenes.    The special effects were also well done, and several artsy shots from the cartoon also appeared in the movie (such as Aeon catching the fly in her eye lashes).    People whom are looking for something which is 100% true to the cartoon may be a bit disapointed.  However I think that most sci-fi fans and fans of the cartoon will enjoy the movie. If you don't fall into either of those categories I can't quite recomend it to you.  The relationship between Trevor and Aeon was quite different in the movie than in the cartoon, and the movie as a whole was not highly symbolic as the cartoon was.  While this makes the movie easier to follow, it does lose some of the appeal of the cartoon.    The other complaint I heard was that the outfits in the movie were way too \\"out there\\", and that the movie was almost pornographic. I can honestly not imagine how someone could consider a movie, which is actually rather tame when it comes to sex, to be nearly pornographic (unless you're really really old fasion). In fact the cartoon was quite kinky, and the movie wasn't really, which I admit to wishing it had been. Also the outfits are not as \\"out there\\" as they were in the cartoon, and if you can appreciate a little bit of weirdness, you will find them well done.    edit:  For those complaining about her not being emotional enough.  That is exactly how the character Aeon Flux is supposed to be.  Those who have seen the cartoon know that Aeon is as a rule (with very few exceptions, Trevor being the main one, which she deals with an appropriate awkwardness), a tough person whom doesn't get emotional involved with other people.  The movie stayed pretty true to this.  While there are a few things in the cartoon that this movie lacked, and I found myself missing them, I do think it is a very well done (though not quite amazing), and interesting adaptation of a cartoon which doesn't easily lend itself to being a live action mostion picture.
1400032717|4.0|What a great adventure. An autistic child is attempting to solve a murder mystery after he finds his neighbor's dog has been slain. The author does a great job of helping the reader understand what thoughts a child has when suffering from Autism. I felt such compassion for the main character all throughout this book; I couldn't put this one down. One of those books where you really feel like you lost a friend when you finish. This one really stirs up some emotion.

006097625X|2.0|W. Melton 's review (titled Guide for Luddites, otherwise unintiated.) expressed what I felt about \\"Understanding Comics\\" best, but I thought I would reiterate. <br />This is a great book if you a) think comics must be meaningless drivel or b) want to argue why comics aren't meaningless drivel, but can't figure it out on your own.  I did not find any revelations within.  The most interesting passages, to me, were how European, American, and Japanese comics differ, but there was not nearly so much time spent on this as trying to \\"validate\\" comics as an art form. <br />As someone who has long loved comics, I don't particularly care if they're considered intellectual or not.  Nor did I glean any insights as to how better enjoy a medium I have for years (except possible Japanese comics, a little bit)  As an amateur comic creator, I found nothing to better my craft.   <br />Also, McCloud may examine why the art is so popular, but he pays very little attention to comic book writing, which I imagine is what most people these days take exception to.  It's not because of the art that they are truely considered \\"pulp\\", after all, but because of the content.  In fact, the only time he mentions writing is as an afterthought to his diagram of \\"iconic vs realistic vs abstract\\" art styles.  I found it strange he didn't examine why \\"superhero\\" comics are so ubiqitious.  There's plenty of room to go back and reference Great Works like \\"the Oddesy\\" and \\"Bhagavad Gita\\", etc.  Epic heroes are as a part of humanity as communicating with pictures (a \\"revelation\\" of McCloud's that seemed readily apparent to me, at least).  Etc etc.  There was little here that an intellegent fan of comics wouldn't have already figured out, and there's nothing here for a non-intellectual fan of comics (and, unlike other reviewers, I don't fault anyone for not being an intellectual, just as I wouldn't fault anyone for not being a molecular biologist like me)  <br />If you would like an analysis of comics, this is for you.  If you just enjoy comics, this probably isn't for you.  If you're interested in a \\"how to\\" book, you're better off looking elsewhere, unless your trouble is \\"thinking outside the box\\".  (and if you're a fan of independant comics, not being able to \\"think outside the box\\" would be strange indeed)
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Everyone knows the story of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory but youve never experienced it until youve seen it through the eyes of director Tim Burton. The new make of this movie is vastly different then the original. I was quite apprehensive about the Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka. I personally felt that there are much better choices (ie Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Michael Jackson). Johnny Depp's portrayal of wacky Willy Wonka does the trick. All of the acting in thsi movie is a little bit over the top but cartoonish as in true Tim Burton form. Willy Wonka's factory takes on a much more sinister place in the 2005 release. Willy Wonkas motives to find a child successor seem much more clear. Expect much more backstory and a lot less singing as well as the sickest cracked out oompa loompas you could imagine. I think you need to look at this movie not as a remake of the original movie but rather as another interpretation of the original book.  The special features on this DVD are also well worth watching.  They have a lot about the making of the movie, the training of the animals and much much more. Overall I rate this movie a 5 out of 5.
0060899190|1.0|I sometimes wonder how some books ever make it to print, let alone are sold to consumers.  This book sickens me in a few ways and really disappoints, not only with the product itself but with the nature in which it came together. <br /> <br />Firstly, the book is laid out horribly.  It looks quite similar to something someone might paste together in a few minutes with little consideration given to the medium into which is it being transformed and the final outcome in this medium.  The postcards that got cut off the in the middle of the book, and the \\"billboards\\" as another reviewer called them were most annoying. <br /> <br />Secondly, I think the spirit in which this book is published is terrible.  The administrator of the original postsecret site states that by submitting your secrets they essentially become his property and he can do with them as he pleases.  I also find it funny that there is no online archive of these secrets.  There are merely those displayed on the front page of the site and none more.  They're locked away and the only way you can see them is buy going to a museum where an exhibition infrequently shows some of the cards, or by buying this book.  Essentially the \\"author\\" has taken peoples hopes, their fears, dreams, aspirations, disappointments, and failures, and bound them quickly into a volume to make a buck.  I don't agree with that and would discourage people from buying it for this sole reason.  People submitted these secrets because they wanted to reach out and touch people, not so that they could be sold for profit.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Before I begin, these is a link to Kylie in the album. Two lines are \\"Do you believe in LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?\\" and \\"BETTER THE DEVIL that YOU KNOW\\", which are the names of two Kylie songs. Coincidence?<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't enjoyed a Madonna album this much since Bedtime Stories.  Yes, Ray of Light is a high point, but for some reason it didn't really get my adrenaline going the first time I heard it.<br /><br />Those who have slagged Confessions are A: Jocks or Neocons who hate disco, B: Purists who think all lyrics must rise to the level of John Lennon or Joni Mitchell, or C: Haters who can't accept that it's not the eighties anymore.<br /><br />Those who pinned the \\"bad lyrics\\" button on the album hold up I Love New York as a prime example.  If you regarded the lyrics alone, you would be missing out on one of the most bit#%ing, brutal songs out there.  Trust me, what looks like awful lyrics on paper PERFECTLY match the vibe of the song.  Listen before you judge.<br /><br />Basically, this album is every gay man's nightlife soundtrack.  If you have never been on the dancefloor of a gay discotheque, then perhaps you couldn't handle this album.<br /><br />The first half of the album is bloody brilliant.  Hung Up benefits from a killer ABBA hook.  The true test comes with Get Together, an upbeat number that sets the standard high for the rest of the album.  Again, the lyrics don't really matter; this kind of music is about creating a vibe, and giving you a high.<br /><br />Sorry puts me off a little, with Madonna repenting in different languages.  It all seems a little forced.  Still, the beat is excellent.  Future Lovers is Madonna's best collaboration with Mirwais, who produced her Music album.  This song throbs with intensity, as Madonna sings \\"give me evidence of its brilliance\\" over and over.<br /><br />I Love New York, as I said, is a killer.  This will be an anthem on Fire Island, for sure.  I love the line about \\"little p@ssies who scream.\\"  Madonna's attitude here is FIERCE. Also, as a Texan, I did laugh at that \\"golf\\" line.  Kinda reminds me of the Tom Delay types I see around here who think that golf wear can be worn on formal occasions.  Don't forget the toothpick in the mouth!<br /><br />Let It Will Live is a bit preachy, but again the soundscape is incredible.  At this point, the album settles into a slightly more relaxed groove.  Forbidden Love unfortunately breaks the rule for an artist not naming two songs the same in their catalogue.  It's good, but not really one of my favorites.<br /><br />Jump sets the bar high again.  I'm sure the twinks out there will be all over this one.  It's a spectacular song, easily one of Madonna's best.  I dare you to get the chorus out of your head.<br /><br />How High is another song that is a little heavy-handed, but again it doesn't SOUND bad.  Isaac is fine by me- certainly, other dance artists have integrated \\"world beat\\" into their music.<br /><br />The last two songs, coincidentally, are my least favorites.  Push sounds like an unreleased song from the Bedtime Stories recording sessions, souped up and tacked onto Confessions.  It sounds rather out of place. I asked myself, \\"Who let Missy Elliot in the room?\\"  And Like It or Not is TOO preachy.  Madonna does give us healthy doses of her \\"older and wiser\\" mentality throughout, but here it overpowers you.  This is the song where her vocals are pushed the most to the forefront, which doesn't help.  There is an interesting, slinky beat which sounds cold and wet to me.<br /><br />Confessions pretty much blows a lot of other diva's albums out of the water.  Artists like Deborah Cox and Toni Braxton have released remix albums.  Madonna trumps them by having a \\"homegrown\\" dance album, instead of remixes, and not succumbing to the \\"my-man-done-me-wrong\\" lyrics, which divas like Whitney, Deborah, and Toni always seem to turn to.  Madonna's efforts are vastly superior.<br /><br />Please, disregard the haters out there, buy this album.egard the haters out there, buy this album. <br />
0060958324|2.0|There are some good reviews already about why this is a bad book, I'll add my vote to that column.  It being such a best selling book and supposedly about zen (see title, Zen and the Art...) I came into the book excited.  It started out interesting but became tedious.   <br /> <br />He goes on and on about motercycle maintenence as if his goal was  to bore the reader (which he succeeds quite admirably at).  The way he talks also grows old fast, very self concious which he might be doing to show he has psychological problems, but it doesn't work.  It reminds me of the way a high schooler would talk who is perhaps a little clever, but certainly not up to the task of writing a book.  It's a little like the book \\"A Work of Hearbreaking Genius\\" which sucked even more than this book. <br /> <br />There are some interesting thoughts in the book but it's overwhelmed by the trash.  If a friend of mine enjoyed this book I'd lose respect for him.
0375703861|5.0|This successful work of narrative contemplates and analyzes the topic of social and cultural immigration within Muslim and Jamaican families migrated to the northern part of London between the 70s and the 90s.  White Teeth presents the social problem of ethnicity as the shared problem of diverse citizenship with a common `home'.  Several are the problems that immigrants have to face when migrate to a new and often different country.  The biggest issue could be often found answering to the eternal question of: integration or assimilation? Or better, should immigrants adapt themselves in the new culture and therefore accept to loose partially their values and beliefs or should they maintain live their native cultural and social traits that will distinguish them from the rest of the crowd? Is social identity more important than it is to adapt and acquire new and different values that will eventually lead to the result of becoming part of a big melting pot society?         <br />These questions create the vital theme of the book.  White Teeth does not avoid the issue of ethnic tension and it presents the social problem of ethnicity and immigration that often in time leads to a host culture that is insensitive toward cultural diversity.  A book definetly worth it on the basis of cultural and moral values.
0596007124|4.0|At first glance, the book looks weird, with child-like drawings, quasi hand-written explanations and 'bad' jokes. But all of these are actually very helpful in communicating intent. For example in larger code listings, you can safely ignore most of the code and just pay attention to the 'manual' notes which show very clearly what is happening and why. They're much easier to pick up than embedded comments in the code would be. Interviews with patterns, which also appear regularly, emphasize the finer points and subtle differences between different patterns. <br /> <br />The book claims Java knowledge to be a requirement. I found this is mostly not the case. There are some Java-dependent implementations here and there (the implementation of the Proxy pattern comes to mind as something that is too Java-centric to be useful in other languages, though the purpose and principles of the pattern are still clear). Most of the code is very readable if you just know how to interpret curly-brace syntax and are familiar with basic object terminology. <br /> <br />Downsides are: <br />- relative lack of 'real' examples of where a given pattern could be used. If you have any experience programming, you'll probably recognize as you read about some patterns that you've already used them (or something similar to them), or at least identify places where you wished you had done so. But it wouldn't hurt to have some more realistic examples than the duck simulator. <br />- I found the exercises to be mostly too simple to bother with. <br />- The leftover patterns get a treatment which I think is too short to be useful. I'd have preferred having 4 pages per leftover pattern, or two pages but more tightly packed than they are now.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Certainly the jewel in the Tremors series of movies between 1990 and 2004 is the original. It's funny. It's scary. It's suspenseful. It's got a great cast. It's fun to watch! And this DVD release gives you the three follow-on sequels for almost the price you'd expect to spend for the original cult classic by itself.<br /><br />In the original 1990 \\"Tremors\\", you have Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as the leading characters. Their performance together is (almost) on par with John Travolta and Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction; the dialogue between these guys is priceless. They truly come across as buddies for life.<br /><br />The story is simple: a B-movie-esque scenario where giant man-eating subterranean monsters (big wormlike things called aptly named Graboids) start plucking man and animal from the surface in a remote desert town. Bacon and Ward are trapped by the underground beasts with little known Finn Carter and mercenary neighbors (Michael Gross) and his wife (Reba McEntire). The result is a fun story of everyone saving themselves and finding a way to kill the monsters before the monsters eat them all.<br /><br />Tremors 2 is very entertaining. Another fun movie and an above par sequel. But gone is the realistic notion that the original movie carried with \\"these-people-are-trapped-and-have-no-choice-but-to-fight-the-monsters-themselves\\". Instead remnant cast members Ward and Gross (instead of the military or some superior entity) are commissioned to dispose of the reappearance of the Graboids. Kevin Bacon is a huge loss to the the comradery factor that the original held. The flick moves a long well, has a good story, it's still scary and suspenseful, and has a great surprise twist when the Graboids mutate making this somewhat of an original in its own right.<br /><br />The next two movies, Tremors 3 and Tremors 4 are fair. I could easily spend less time and be as entertained by the much shorter SpongeBob Squarepants 10 minute \\"Alaskan Bull Worm!\\" tribute episode to the original Tremors.<br /><br />Tremors 3 is the better of the two with another mutation twist, and an entertaining story. Michael Gross is back as Burt, but you really have to turn a blind eye to the why-hasn't-anyone-called-the-frickin'-army factor. Tremors 4 is a prequel to the original that is difficult to sit all the way through. There is really no need to elaborate on #3 or #4, because they are both so predictable based on the first two that you can easily guess what they are about and what happens.<br /><br />A cool thing about all of them is that creator, writer, producer and director SS Wilson is on board for all four flicks to hold everything together better than other films that spawn one too many sequels.<br /><br />All in all, as I said earlier, the original Tremors alone makes this a very, very worthwhile addition to any collector's movie library, in-genre or out. The addition of Tremors 2 makes this purchase a very easy Add to Cart. \\"But be advised, Burt, there are two more...I repeat...two more mother-humpers\\".is the better of the two with another mutation twist, and an entertaining story.

B000B8QEYC|2.0|For all that Enya has a lovely voice, this disc is surprisingly bland - it has now reached the point for me that, on the whole, Enya's more recent discs all sound the same. I commented to a friend after the first listen that it was \\"more of the same,\\" and it is: interchangeable, tepid songs. The only ear-catching track for me is The River Sings; at least there's some life in it. Otherwise, it's another disc of echoey, uninspiring material. And that truly is a shame, since her earlier material broke some new ground. She needs to now break out of her own self-inflicted box and stretch a bit. Lesson learned - I'll make sure to hear the disc before purchase next time, since one lively song isn't enough to make me purchase a disc.

1400082773|5.0|Obama's memoir traces his search for his roots and identity.  He divides the narrative into three parts, the first third dealing with his childhood and nuclear family; the second, with his political work; the third, with his extended family in Kenya.  I thought these divisions worked well to thoroughly cover each topic, giving the reader a clear sense of his origins and quest for a home.  He gradually weaves his father into the memoir, never over-emphasizing this emerging theme.  Obama also tells his story chronologically, tracking his growth.  However, I felt like he could have done more to connect each part and illustrate how his past contributed to the growth.  Each division was very distinct - new setting, new age, new purpose.  <br /> Obama constantly amends his perspective, representing how his ideas have developed over time.  Upon leaving Chicago for law school, for example, he ponders what brought him there in the first place.  He considers his motivations and goes from \\"the father of [his] dreams\\" to \\"simple acceptance\\" to \\"faith\\" within one page (278).  He gains the reader's confidence by depicting all his struggles and thought processes, including phases or decisions that were faulty or foolish.  Especially because he is a politician, I admired how he even included embarrassing stories, such as an argument from college concerning maids and alcohol-related mess (109).  The description is also a fault: I found the second third exhausting, due to the amount of political detail in the same setting.  I also struggled keeping track of his extended family in the final third.  In the new preface, Obama himself admits he'd like to cut this older memoir by about fifty pages.  At times, the detail is too technical and overwhelming.  It detracts from the overall story.   <br /> Although he narrates his story beautifully, the prose is also long-winded.  It seemed like important realizations were buried within lengthy sentences.  Many times I'd find myself rereading sentences over and over.  If the reader is truly interested in politics and racial struggles, he might have the patience for the prose.  But if the interest isn't there, it's a long read.

1573223026|5.0|It is always thrilling to find a new writer, and as Nick Hornby has now entered my life and been added to my list of favorite authors, I sigh in contentment.  A Long Way Down has been sitting on my book shelf for over a year and I picked it up yesterday morning and finally put it down late last night; so taken in was I with the quirky characters.  I could not leave them alone as they could not leave each other, despite their only unique thread being their sorrow and despairs over life.  Each of the four characters are created with exact precision: JJ, Jess, Maureen and Martin would never travel in the same circles, for their lives are worlds apart.  Curiously enough, I found a bit of myself in each character, the mother in Maureen, the anger and poignancy in Jess, the lack of purpose in being a mediocre artist in a field you worship like JJ, and then being selfish like Martin.  The book unfolds in an enigmatic manner with each character having their epiphanies that come out of an existential despair.   <br /> <br />Early on in the novel Jess explains that although she is the youngest she does indeed understand them all, \\"You thought you were going to be someone, but now it's obvious you're nobody.  You haven't got as much talent as you thought you had, there was no Plan B, and you got no skills and no education, and now you are looking at forty or fifty years of nothing.  Less than nothing, probably.  That's pretty heavy...\\"  <br /> <br />So it is.  Never morose, brilliantly insightful, often challenging, and laugh out loud comical, this a wonderful read and I recommend it highly. <br /> <br />Nicole Flowers <br />

And that`s just the beggining. Regarding to the lyrics only a sick person like kurt kobain can writte such a stupid, borring, sad, songs. Thanx God the world is better place without nirvana, unfortunately bans like pearl jam, creed, etc, etc are still around but they will die soon enough. I just can`t believe how grunge and alternative sh$t make it so big in the 90s but those times are changing, the interest for glam rock is growing bigger every day and the heavy metal genre in Europe and South America is begginig to kick ass again, if you don`t belive me just listen to bands like sonata artica, ed guy, the masters of symphonic metal Rhapsody and many more, bands that combine technique, talent, compositon, epic lyrics and if that is to elaborated for you stick to the basic yes glam rock, hard rock and 80s metal (SKID ROW) not to many composition but lots of fun and talent. Do you know why they call this ``alternative`` music, because this music is for those who never knew what to choose i mean between rock and pop, so they mix a lot of noises and slow driven music to create this pointless genre that always tried to copy the power, youth, and that in your face way of live that made entire generations stand up and fight for what they believe, but alternative and grunge bands never achieve this, only rock and roll did it, AND NO OTHER GENRE COULD EVER MATCH THIS........

B000001EUR|4.0|This is the release that followed the band's 1982 hit album Blackout. It is perhaps the peak of the Scorpions' recording plateau studio-wise. They were indeed firing on all 8 cylinders on this one.    Song listing and thoughts:    1. Bad Boys Running Wild - a great opening song with Schenker on rhythm and the frantic Jabs on lead guitar    2. Rock You Like A Hurricane - this song took the world by storm and wouldn't let go ... sleazy lyrics and A+ solo work by Matthias    3. I'm Leaving You - kinda a mixture of a mid tempo rocker/ballad which works really well    4. Coming Home - starts with the false ballad opening then rolls hard the rest of the way    5. The Same Thrill - a fast paced song, sounds kinda rushed though    6. Big City Nights - a Schenker masterpiece...don't let the guitar tracking fool you, this song is nearly all Schenker. Mr. Flying V starts off with the main rhythm and also plays the lead melody. Matthias plays the 2nd rhythm and the solo fills for the chorus, but Schenker returns with the lead melody along with his powerful lead solo. However, when played live Matthias had/has to play Rudolph's intro rhythm guitar part to compensate    7. As Soon As the Good Times Roll - a mid tempo song with different drum stops, a cool touch    8. Crossfire - a nice slow burning song with Matthias and his laser shooting guitar    9. Still Loving You - a ballad masterpiece featuring Schenker baby aka Mr. Flying V on the soaring lead guitar    Klaus' vocals are top notch throughout.    A great album by a hard rocking band that made it big and deserved it. Something that has always bugged me about Love At First Sting is that Matthias' guitar tracking volumes are noticeably low in the mix for whatever reason (compared to Blackout or Savage Amusement), but that's just a minor picky track mixing detail.
B00005OM4N|5.0|2001's \\"BRITNEY\\" is the best album of the super stars career.  Unlike 1999's \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" and 2000's \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" there are no throw away tracks. This is the full listen. First let me start of by saying the singles are great, and some of her best, and even non-singles were great. Some of the non-singles are even better than some songs on the album that did become singles. I first heard this album in summer of 2002 when it was released over in Europe.  You can tell Britney has really grown as a singer and is stronger than ever before on this album, and had started to collaberate with artists more, such as The neptunes on \\"Slave 4 U\\", and \\"Boys\\". This was the first time she had ever written some of the tracks on an album before, so the growth as an artist is there. The album is still bubble gum pop, but some of the tracks included in the set are that of an edgier sound - particually \\"Slave 4 U\\",\\"Boys\\" and \\"Lonely\\". On this album Britney clearly felt the need to try new things in her music.  I found i can listen to this album over and over in my personal stereo, and it never left my C D player. I enjoyed the previous two albums, but found this one the best. Sadly, to tell the truth I don't think any future album Britney Spears does will ever come close to the masterpiece this is.  Below is a Track by Track raiting of the Album.  1. I'm A Slave 4 U.  The first single of the album. First bump and grind track we hear by her. This is the track that helped Britney reinvent herself as an artist with an edgier sound, and i like it. 4/5  2. Overprotected.  This is my favourite single of the whole album. Please note this album version is the international video version - not the Darkchild remix, that was also released as a single at the same time. Classic Britney track - one of her best singles. If you like this one then this is the album for you. 5/5  3. Lonely.  This is a fun song half way between Classic Britney and Edgy Britney. Sounds a lot like a Darkchild song, because it was produced by Rodney Jerkins. I like the wrap bit in the middle - shows a bit of attitude. 3/5  4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.  At this point in her career this was Britney's most beautiful and mature song. This was the 3rd single of the album and quite heartwarming. This album needed a sentimental monent, and this song shows Britney becoming a woman, so not only is it important to the record, but to Britney herself. 4/5  5. Boys.  Please note this is not the Co-Ed remix that was remixed with Pharell Williams and released as a single. This is a good remix though. 3/5  6. Anticipating.  Classic Britney song. This was released as a single, without a video, but deserves to be a single. Sounds reminiscent to any song of \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" Very catchy and you will find it going round and round in your head over the day. 5/5  7. I Love Rock 'N' Roll.  This is a cover of the Joan Jett song, and suits Britney, because she is a southern girl, so she has the right vocals, and this song goes with her personality (Probably) I watched an interview on MTV, and she said it was one of her favourite tracks, so she remade it for the album. This single was only released in Europe. Not the U.S. 4/5  8. Cinderella.  This is one of the tracks Britney helped write on the album.  This track is one of the best Britney songs of her whole career and if had been made a single, would have definitley gone to #1.  It is classic Britney at her best and sounds very Cinematic. The best part of it is when the first verse changes to the chorus. Either this track or \\"Overprotected\\" is my favourite on the album. 5/5  9. Let Me Be.  A short song, reminiscent to any on \\"Oops\\" Quite Cheery, but seems like a filler track. 3/5  10. Bombastic Love.  A Sound clip of this song was featured at the start of the Overprotected video where Britney is walking out of the studio past all the Paparatzi. This is a very good song, sounds a lot like an N*Sync song. Good bass too. VeryCinematic and fits in with the album well. Good single material. 5/5  11. That's Where You Take Me.  This is a sweet candy-pop song. Fits in well with this Album. Sounds quite childish, but very cute. One of Britneys best songs. 5/5  12. What It's Like To Be Me.  Good song, but forgettable once it's been listened to once or twice. Justin Timberlake's vocals appear on the tack. He does backing on this one.  3/4    This text refers to the U.S Version of \\"Britney\\"  The European version has two bonus tracks, which i've heard. They are very good, so i suggest buying the European release,  They are \\"When I Found You\\" & \\"Before The Goodbye\\".
B000BGH22W|1.0|Williams' scores had magic and grace... this is awful. In fact, it's rather a bit of a joke... it has none of the magic or flair that the first 3 soundtracks had. The movies may be getting better, but the soundtrack is one of my first complaints about this movie.  HOPEFULLY for OOP they will return to the WIlliams' magical score. I'm a collector of Potter merchandise-- I have absolutely everything Potter, even the bedsheets, to tell you how obsessed I am. BUT this I will not buy.  Don't waste your money. You couldn't give it to me.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Tarantino is just a director who takes existing films and recreates them. Rips them off, if thats how you look at it, he even admits it. Is that such a bad thing? Meh, if he can make a good movie thats fun to watch, I don't really care. <br /> <br />There is no substance to this movie, even for the stands of 'pop artwork'. To put it plainly, the action scenes are just plain boring. I'm a fan of action ranging from realistic to \\"violence for the sake of violence\\", but I was yawning throw the entire movie. If you want hardcore ultra silly vilence, there are much better things out there. It seems like this movie is popular amungst those who like to brag about how they \\"love bloody and gory movies\\". Sure, I went through my junior high phase of bragging about watching stuff like faces of death and co., but I think its time to grow up. The funny thing is, I was expecting it to be much more violent then it turned out to be. <br /> <br />I guess I'm grasping at something good to say about this one, but having a tough time comming up with anything. I pretty much look at it as a bunch of flashing nothing to enthrall a stupified gawking auidence. Perhaps that was the point. I guess there were a few pretty scenes. <br /> <br />I thought vol.2 was a very good film, however.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Marillion's been around for a long time. And they release everything, and their dog. In addition, they can be attributed to two of the greatest progressive rock album of all time - Brave, and Misplaced Childhood. They asked their fans to pre-order their upcoming album, months before the CD was titled or even recorded. And guess what? Their hardcore fanbase bought the album, and funded Marillion to record one of the greatest albums in progressive rock history. <br /> <br />In case you lack skills in following paths made in text, I was referring to Marbles. <br /> <br />I'll start off and inform you that this review will be based on the double-album of Marbles - which you can purchase only from Marillion's website. Nothing wrong with this single-album version of it, but the 2CD simply has more. <br /> <br />The tracklist of the double album is as follows. <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br />1. The Invisible Man  <br />2. Marbles I  <br />3. Genie  <br />4. Fantastic Place  <br />5. The Only Unforgivable Thing  <br />6. Marbles II  <br />7. Ocean Cloud  <br />   <br />Disc 2   <br />1. Marbles III   <br />2. The Damage   <br />3. Don't Hurt Yourself   <br />4. You're Gone   <br />5. Angelina  <br />6. Drilling Holes   <br />7. Marbles IV  <br />8. Neverland  <br /> <br />So, that said, it has many amazing tracks, and one of the best is not contained in the single disc version. <br /> <br />Marillion is a very unique band. Their style of music is a near-laid back rock - similar to Pink Floyd's album 'Dark Side of the Moon'. The instrumentalization is unquestionably amazing. The only drawback may be the vocals. Steve Hogarth, to me, is a very efficient vocalist and he suits the music well. To some, he's nearly intolerable. <br /> <br />This album has a ton of songs, and three epics. The Invisible Man, Ocean Cloud, and Neverland. The second - Ocean Cloud - is not on the single disc version of the album, and it's one of the greatest songs Marillion has ever recorded. Its nearly 18 minutes long, so you can't go wrong. <br /> <br />I'm not going to get into the songs. It wouldn't be fair if I tried to explain them. Just think of this as very well written radio rock songs. If it wasn't for the near-controversial message of some songs, the over-average length of time of some songs, and the talent of all the songs, you could see these guys played beside U2. Since, after all, a lot of their songs sound like a better U2. <br /> <br />Let me put it this way. This album is good enough that I'm going to just stop this review right here because my fumbling around words is insulting to the music.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Polar Express\\" is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  In order to give the film a true \\"storybook\\" look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds.  The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.<br /><br />The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa.  One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter.  Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.<br /><br />On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy.  Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement.  Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.<br /><br />The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it.  However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters.  Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting.  Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back.  Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas.  On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it.  And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.<br /><br />\\"Polar Express\\" may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons.e it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|Sorry to all the musical morons who wrote those earlier reviews, but this album is quite good.  I'll be the first to admit I didn't care for John Mayer's pop music and his first two albums.  This album though is definately a legitimate step in the right direction for him.  Most of the original material on here is fresh and great to listen to. At times he falls into generic blues jams (Out of My Mind), but that is really my only complaint.  The new songs are ROCKING and a lot fo fun to listen to (Who Did You Think I Was, Good Love Is On The Way, Try) and he even does a good job giving new life to his older songs (Something's Missing, Daughters). <br /> <br />No one said he was doing anything groundbreaking, he's just trying to go in a new direction and ditch his old teen heartthrob image. I'm just hoping we can expect to hear much more the explosive guitar solos and smooth blues playing from him in the future. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000BJS4SU|1.0|Forget the loser who calls anyone who isnt in love with this album musical morons, sorry ...the album stinks. These songs are about as generic as they come. Its music like this that makes people thinks the blues are boring, formulaic songs and typical copycat riffing. Nothing to set itsself apart from the pack. I dont care if john mayer is just trying to do different from his usual fare, that doesnt mean its good. Im not judging this against previous john mayer,which if i did i would probably give it 3 stars. No, im judging it against other (stronger) blues rock albums....and compared to those...this album is pretty banal. If you are simply a john mayer fan and know nothing of people like Indigenous or Doyle Bramhall II and Smokestack,,, then go ahead and get this since you wont know what you are missing anyway. On the other hand if you know about these (and other) superior artists, stay away from this mediocre blues rock schlock.
0812550706|5.0|I found this book's voice to be pull me along into an unknown world and a child's mind.  Once I started reading this, it was impossible to put down.  The main character, Ender, is compelling and lives a life driven by choices. He is forced to be a pawn a game whose rules are set by others.  Within that game, he finds ways to win and beat them.  But in this book, the concepts of winning and losing are not what they seem.
B00064VR0W|5.0|My son just turned two-years old at the beginning of November, and has absolutely ADORED this DVD for the past 6 months.  He watches it EVERYDAY, and when I try to offer him the Wiggles he runs to get this DVD!!  Ever since he was an infant we \\"danced\\" around to the Songbook I and II CD's, and I also took him to see Rod Stewart at the outdoor Concord Pavillion in the SF Bay Area when he was 9 months old.  Now, he can't get enough of the visual and audio of this wonderful DVD.  I wish there were more DVD's of his music to amuse my son!!  It's a wonderful DVD the whole family can enjoy, I assure you!
B000002I2I|5.0|This album was released near the end of the era of the Doors. After slipping a bit from the level of the first two albums, this, their fifth, is a return to that earlier quality, if not the earlier style.  The band had had many ups and downs by early 1970 when this was released.  Concerts were being canceled all of the place due to Morrison's behavior on stage.  Jim's alcohol abuse continued to be a problem, but in all of this, they managed to put together an excellent collection of songs. While his performance was hindered by his drinnking, his songwriting was not.  This album received critical acclaim even though it produced no hit singles.  So if you are unfamiliar with the songs, don't let that hold you back.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Inspired by Puccini's \\"La Boh&egrave;me,\\" the musical movie version of Rent revolves around a group of late Eighties down-and-out young artists living in the part of the Lower East Side known locally as Alphabet Soup (for Avenues A, B, C, and D). It's one of the lowest-rent districts in Manhattan, but they still can't afford their rent.<br /><br />They can't find work in their quirky fields. They face straight and gay love problems and meanwhile (also) the realities of living with AIDS, which afflicts four of the eight key characters. Still, their boundless love and hope carry them through.<br /><br />The stage version of Rent won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Obie Award, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, four Tony Awards and three Drama Desk awards, alas too late for composer Jonathan Larson to appreciate his success: he died of an aortic aneurysm the night before the show's first off-Broadway performance.<br /><br />After 10 years on Broadway, the show has attracted a huge following--many of whom have seen it several times. But you don't need to have seen the original Broadway musical to enjoy this film: There's singing and dancing on the streets, on fire-escapes, on table-tops and in subway cars. It all enchantingly carries the plot along.<br /><br />Director Chris Columbus recast six actors in the roles they played when the stage show opened--Anthony Rapp as filmmaker Mark Cohen, Idina Menzel as performance artist Maureen Johnson, Adam Pascal as songwriter Roger, Jesse L. Martin as computer programmer Tom Collins, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as drag queen drummer Angel and Taye Diggs as the landlord's son-in-law Benny Coffin III. All six perform with amazing panache. The two newcomers--Rosario Dawson as exotic dancer and drug addict Mimi Marquez and Tracie Thoms as an attorney and Maureen's lesbian lover Joanne Jefferson--are equally alluring.<br /><br />The film opens with \\"Seasons of Love.\\" The entire cast sings of the importance of every moment. Then \\"Rent\\" sets the story flowing. Mark Cohen is off to making films of friends and his neighborhood before running home to find Roger and Tom Collins asking them to throw down the key. Before getting upstairs, Tom is attacked by thugs. Angel, drumming on a plastic can in the street, hears him moaning and comes to his rescue in a nearby alleyway, thus setting off the film's gay love affair.<br /><br />Mimi flirts with Roger in \\"Light My Candle\\" and although he rejects her with \\"Another Day,\\" she comes back again in \\"Out Tonight.\\" Tom and Angel go to their AIDS support group, which sings of overcoming their fears in \\"Will I?\\" Mark commiserates with Joanne in \\"The Tango Maureen.\\" The cast lauds their happy-go-lucky lifestyle in \\"La Vie Boheme.\\" Angel and Tom fall for one another in \\"I'll Cover You.\\" And Roger reclaims a chance with Mimi in \\"Your Eyes.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of entertainment, and some lessons for life packed into this beauty of a film. See it.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappenhen \\"Rent\\" sets the story flowing.

B000BPCCZA|1.0|I can't say anything about the musical quality of this CD, as I have been unable to actually listen to it.  Sony apparently recorded this disc in an odd format (AIFF) to ensure most computers would not be able to play it properly.  My iBook simply rejected the CD.  As I only listen to music at my computer or my iPod, I couldn't play this CD at all.  Sony hasn't contacted me back on my complaint, and it looks like I'm out $18 bucks (shipping + CD costs).  If you want to listen to this CD, download it from Napster or iTunes, if you don't mind the loss in quality.   <br /> <br />Sony obviously doesn't care about its customers anymore...
0553801503|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am very disappointed in those reviews that do not quite see the merit in this new installment of a Song of Fire and Ice.  I would agree with any earlier review that downgraded the editing, but I would have to think that Mr. Martin was aware of this and for some reason wnated the book to come out this way.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information that has been dedicated to:<br /><br />  CERSEI - we find out more about her hatred and her desire to be the queen of Westeros.  I think he has also developed her into a force to be reckoned with and has shown a rift between her and JAIME.<br /><br />  JAMIE - While he continues to lament over his lost hand he shows a weaker side in his relationship to BRIENNE and her task at hand.  I think that Martin has also shown a wonderful change in the realtionship between her and her sister and possibly a feeling that JAIME has not made the mose noble of decisions throughout his life and possible at this point he is maturing<br /><br />  SER LORAS - lets just say he remains a subtle character but important<br /><br />  BRIENNE -  while I didn't really care for her in the other tomes I think he has really made her into a main character and someone that I was looking forward to in the book.  Hers is probably the most noble of the Kingsguard as we see the other knights not staying true to their vows.  Brienne is what all of the knights should be and yet they chastise her because she is a woman.<br /><br />  SANSA and ARYA - Their lines are very short but they are present.  I think the character of Sansa has defintely been given more of role and she should as an older sister.<br /><br />  MAERGERY TYRELL -  The young queen developed throughout the book and for a while I  though she was simply going to be steamrolled by CERSEI and while we never really see her direct intervention I think little MAERGERY is much smarter than we think and I believe she will be around for time to come.<br /><br />  SAMWELL - while he was in the book more than anyone else on the wall it was a very small part and I would have to say the most boring part of the book, but probably the most important part of the storyline as he is going to seek someone out that will change the land forever.<br /><br />The people we hear almost nohing about:<br /><br />  TYRION - What a shame as he is one of the more colorful.<br /><br />  JON SNOW - Maybe a few lines in one chapter but otherwise not present.<br /><br />  BRAN - completely absent<br /><br />  DAENERYS - Very small part and one chapter as a teaser at the end of the book.  I am not a particular fan of Dany so this part did not really effect me too much, but she will obviously be a major role in a DANCE WITH DRAGONS.<br /><br />  STANNIS and MELISANDRE - absent but coming<br /><br />Overall, I can see the reason so many people are upset by this book, but it truely is a marvelous work and I enjoyed reading every page of it.  If the next installment were coming out this month then I think everyone would be happy, but this is not so.  My one complaint is that he seems to have gone to every effort to include names of people that really are not a part of the book.  He may mention them in a passing conversation and since there are already so many characters it can get confusing at times.  Thank goodness he has included a glossary of the houses and characters for us when we get confused.<br /><br />In his own words Mr Martin said \\"This one was a Bi*ch\\"  I think we have to give him the trust and blind faith that we know he is going to bring us to the end.  I can't even fathom writing a story of this magnitude and think it is a blessing that we have such auhors.<br /><br />Give the man a break and be patient.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: EPIC....MUST HAVEome. <br /> <br />     SAMWELL - while he was in the book more than anyone else on the wall it was a very small part and I would have to say the most boring part of the book, but probably the most important part of the storyline as he is going to seek someone out that will change the land forever. <br /> <br />The people we hear almost nohing about: <br /> <br />      TYRION - What a shame as he is one of the more colorful. <br />   <br />      JON SNOW - Maybe a few lines in one chapter but otherwise not present. <br /> <br />      BRAN - completely absent <br /> <br />     DAENERYS - Very small part and one chapter as a teaser at the end of the book.

0553801503|5.0|The book: This book is great, as everything George R. R. Martin writes is. True, there is less action in it then in previous books, but that's because the war has wound down and mow there are reinforcements at the wall to defend it from others. But still, there is not one boring page in this book. It is a fantastic addition to the Song of Ice and Fire, and everyone giving it one and two star reviews because they're pissed that their favorite character wasn't in it is acting like a spoiled baby.Yes, I miss some of them too, and I would have loved to read about Bran, Tyrion, and Jon Snow but as readers, we take what the author can give, and a Dance With Dragons is already half way done. I'm not happy about the wait, but wait I will.      The chapters in this book are divided up as follows (not in order of progression)    Aeron (Damphair) Greyjoy (2)   Asha Greyjoy (1)  Victarion Greyjoy (2)    Areo Hotha, captain of the prince of Dorne's guards (1)   Arianne Martell, Princess of Dorne (2)   Ser Arys Oakheart, Kingsgaurdman in Dorne (1)    Cersei Lannister, Queen Regent (10)  Jamie Lannister, Captain of the Kingsgaurd (7)    Brienne, Maid of Tarth (8)    Arya Stark/Cat of the canals (3)  Sansa Stark/Alayne (3)    Samwell Tarly (5)     The Cover: It's just not as nice as the beautifully illustrated covers of the past books.    The Author: yes, I'm a little angry that George R. R. Martin couldn't pull together the whole book in time for publication, but even if he had they would have split in two for money reasons, and because would just be too long. Still, I don't see any reason why everyone needs to think Martin is headed the way of Robert Jordon (not that I've read the wheel of time, but apparently it just goes on and on...) he will finish the series in seven books instead of six, and I seriously doubt anyone who vowed not to by a dance With Dragons will actually do so.    The publishers: They suck. I want the other half of the story. I do understand the need for profit though, and I'll buy all the remaining books in this series the day they come out. I can not wait for a Dance With Dragons.    So even though the publication of this book had its problems, it's still a five star novel in a five star series. And the other half will be out soon. I just may head back and read 1-4 again in the meantime. Stop freaking out about the splitting of the story and take a deep breath everyone, everything will turn out fine.
B000067DNC|3.0|Season 1 i'll give it 5 stars for subtitles but on the others there are no subtitles. The series are excellent, all is perfect but it would be better and sell better if they would have subtitles in English or Spanish.  <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|My 16 year old son came home one day with what he deemed, 'one of the coolest, rockin' cd's in awhile.'  Needless to say, I was surprised to have him play Vertigo for me, from the latest U2 album.  I have been listening to U2 for over 20 years!  I have most of their stuff on vinyl!  My son and his friends were loving it!  I had to give it a listen....of course.  As an old school U2 fan, I was pleasantly surprised by their seeming return to their roots...albeit a bit more enhanced and technologically advanced...Atomic Bomb, is a definite return to what has made U2...legends. I absoulutely love this album and am so thankful that they left that techno stuff of the nineties behind.  Once again, music with a message, amazing lyrics and although people criticize The Edge and Bono for sounding like they did before; let's face it...that sound is the unmistakable sound of U2.  Bono's voice is filled with intensity and emotion and has aged well!  I love this album.  It feels intimate and real.
1401307787|5.0|Unlike Kabat-Zinn's previous book, Full Catastrophe Living, which is a somewhat dense tome about stress reduction, this book is more a collection of short, interrelated tidbits  that will get you to sit and meditate. Kabat-Zinn has a non-denominational approach to meditation, mentioning its Buddhist origins, but not proning Buddhism. For those of use who are atheists/agnostics, this is refreshing. The book itself does not give many instructions on meditation, so if you are looking for a first book on meditation, this is not what you need. But reading its short chapters from time to time might just remind you why you started doing this strange practice that is meditation, and help keep you sitting a bit longer.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Ever since the hard-rocking, political SOAD album, Mezmerize, came out, I have been highly anticipating the release of Hypnotize. Hypnotize, the brother album of Mezmerize, was recorded at the same time as the previous, but the band decided to stagger the second's release by 6 months to avoid the double-album dilemma. <br /> <br />As I assumed, Hypnotize is very similar to Mezmerize, which can be expected since they were actually recorded at the same time, and in the same political spirit. This being said, Hypnotize fails to live up to the powerhouse rock opus of Mezmerize.  <br /> <br />Though Hypnotize has a handful of amazing tracks (including the opening track Attack, which is in and of itself an attack at the way our government is running our country), the sad lement Dreaming, the ravaging stomp of Kill Rock 'N Roll, and the amazing finale Soldier Side, which is one of the most real and passionate rock songs written this year. <br /> <br />Most of the other songs are decent to good, but a couple are simply unbearable. I have listened to the album in its entirety 4 or 5 times, and now I just skip over U-Fig and She's Like Heroin. Compared to the rest of the album, these songs just do not fit. While lead singer Serj Tankian's repetitive screams and cries are often the edge SOAD needs to surpass the talents of many other rock bands in the mainstream today, they become annoying in the above songs.  <br /> <br />Hypnotize is an extremely well-produced and well-written album, but held side by side with Mezmerize (which I would give 5 stars), this new album simply falls short.
0752545639|3.0|A nice collection of all of Shakespeare's works, including three versions of Lear, but this book is unwieldy and impractical. My biggest gripe is with the paper - it's so thin that you are generally reading two pages at a time.<br /><br />Aside from that, it is a good way to have a complete Shakespeare at a decent price, but you won't find it very readable.
0060899190|5.0|My secret was included in the book, and despite what at least one other reviewer thinks, I was greatly relieved and happy that my secret was made public.  It took a large burden from me.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|There is nothing to say about this CD except for good things! I think that this CD is one of her best CD's yet along with Come On Over. It has all of her greatest hits along with some new songs like \\"Don't, I Ain't No Quitter and Party For Two(with Billy and Mark)\\". This is a really nice CD because if you just listen to some of the lyrics, depending on what mood you're in, it'll make you feel really good. If you're going through a rough time or if you're really happy about something, this is the CD for you to help you bring up your moods! All I am trying to say is that if you do not already have Shania Twain's greatest hits, then you are missing on a really good CD. Buy this CD or you will be missing out on some good music.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Dear rebel scum (or new Republic, whatever), <br />I was watching Episode 4 (New Hope) the other day and realized how close (as usual) the good old Empire came to ending that impetuous rebellion once and for all. I think it boils down to bad planning. The example? Look no further than the climax of said New Hope: the Death Star is moving into position to attack/blow the crap out of Yavin, where the insidious Rebels are residing. But, oh! the Empire must first get the Death Star around this red planet which is blocking their shot. Wait, read that again with emphases (more than one emphasis) on 'planet' and 'blocking their shot'. Could the Empire have concocted their own demise any more efficiently? I mean come on, they have the friggin' DeathStar (tm), which is made to what? Blow up planets, not go around them. It's like asking Cris Carer to throw the ball to himself to get the touchdown, when what he should really be doing is just catching the ball and catching touchdowns.  <br />See what I'm getting at? Maybe we could've used the Death Star to blow up the red planet, therein saving time in navigating it, and then we would have a clear shot at the rebel planet. Were we saving our shots for a later time or something? I think the rebellion, though rather childlike in nature, was a pretty big deal at the time, and one of the imperial officers even informed Tarkin of the potential danger in the attack patterns of the uneducated rebel pilots. But nooooo, Lucas had to make our military leaders Arrogant and Headstrong and the Bad Guys. I mean, honestly, the movie was all believable up to this point, and guess what? The Empire gets creamed for being dumb, not because the rebels were lucky. See, if the Empire does the smart thing and blows up two planets instead of one, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. No; we would all be under the rule of Darth Vader (who we all know would have usurped the Emperor anyway, let's not kid ourselves), who by the way would also havebeen better off if the rebels got creamed, because then he would never have gotten in touch with his softer side when 'getting to know' his kids, who would have been destroyed with the rest of the pest-like rebels.  <br />I do like Episode V, however, as I have a starring role in it, and it ends pretty well too with us bagging Han Solo and Luke's right hand. I generally like to end the series there, as it all goes to crap in Episode VI, what with Vader switching sides, the Emperor 'falling' down a giant hole, and oh, those fuzzbucket Ewoks, who help (why?) the impotent rebels to blow up our shield generator (which is what I was so gloriously doing to the rebels' generator in Ep.V). Really, things came back to bite us rather quickly after that first Death Star, which goes to show that if there's something really important to be done (say, blow up the neanderthal rebel base on Yavin), you should have your top man, for instance, me, making the important decisions. Never you mind where I was at the time of the first DStar exploding (definitely NOT crashlanded and marooned on Yavin, for example), the point is I would have made an excellent Grand Moff, but now all I get to rule over is the kiddie pool in the backyard. It's no Death Star, but that Imperial March really carries well across freshly mown grass and the doghouse. In case you're wondering, I did not die at Balmorra, I simply survived like Gloria Gaynor, and now I 'get jiggy wit it' like Will Smith, despite losing my legs when they blew up my AT-AT at Hoth. Oh how I miss you sweet AT-AT, and how I curse you Rebellion! Long live the Empire! <br />General Maximilian Veers
B000BKDOCA|4.0|Be warned - this cd will automatically install Sony's version of copy-protection software on any windows computer. I consider this software to be a virus as it renders the system open to hacking (code is already in the wild that exploits it). Be very careful. If I had known I would never have purchased or used this disk. Amazon merely says the disk is \\"enhanced\\" - now you know what they enhanced it with. <br /> <br />As for the music, the Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix of Toxic is worth the price of the cd. This is how a remix should be done! with an awsome pounding beat and samples carefully arranged to alter but retain the originals message, its just wonderful. <br /> <br />Several other tracks, especially the Me Against The Music and Touch Of My Hand are outstanding. As is usual in a compilation like this some of them are mediochre and tired-sounding rehashes but nothing is perfect.  <br /> <br />I would have liked to see more from the recent album but overall its a good set, just don't get it if you expect to play it in a computer or move to mp3 device, because if you do you have granted Sony the right to decide what your system will allow you to do.
B0007YMUZW|1.0|I have ALL of Ryan Adams' music, including Whiskeytown. I've really liked (loved) some CDs and songs and rated him as one of my favorite artists. I was anticipating this CD and am very, very disappointed. It meanders all over the place, like how Ryan himself meanders all through a performance. I've seen Ryan perform live twice. Each time, I wonder if he even knows where he is. He reminds me very much of a friend of mine who has ADD. I often wonder if Ryan has ADD, but it's probably just the booze and drugs. <br /> <br />Ryan Adams is/was/might be a good song writer, good musician, or good singer. However, one CD after another simply meanders across a range of styles and emotions. I bought this CD, but will NOT buy Jacksonville City Nights or any others. After experiencing how he treats (mistreats) his fans at his concerts, I'd rather give my money to better musicians and better people. Check out Neil Young's Prairie Wind for a far superior artist and a much better person!!!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|\\"The Matrix\\" burst on the scene with mind-boggling special effects and a witty reality-versus-perception theme that justified those amazing special effects.  A top-notch cast worked with a script that had just enough spirituality associated wtih it that viewers didn't consider \\"The Matrix\\" just another dumb action movie.  At the end, the possibilities of \\"The Matrix\\" seemed limitless -- and the conjectures regarding where this storyline could lead were almost as entertaining as the movie itself. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the sequels bogged down, both in the attempt to top the action scenes of the original, and by the simple truth that by advancing the storyline, the sequels eliminated our ability to speculate where \\"The Matrix\\" was headed.  Just like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" was so scary because we didn't really know or see what was going on, the possibilities of Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity battling against Agent Smith and the machines were more exciting in their unknown state than they could ever be in an actual story. <br /> <br />The creative forces behind \\"The Matrix\\" cannot be accused of failing to delve deeper into the storyline.  By the time \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" came around, we had gone so far beyond the first movie as to make it almost unrecognizable.  Indeed, I had a hard time even figuring out who the villains of \\"Revolutions\\" are -- is Neo most concerned about the machines, or the Merovingian, or the Trainman, or the assassin going after him in Zion . . . and what the hell is Agent Smith doing anyway?  And what about the Architect?   Just who is the Oracle, anyway? <br /> <br />I'm sure there are those who have explored every website, fan fiction storyline, and utterance of those who created the Matrix mythology who understand this complicated storyline.  But I merely watched the movies, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of the story after a while. <br /> <br />Fortunately, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is one of the most enjoyable movies to watch I have ever seen (based on purely visual terms).  The machines eventually breach the human stronghold of Zion, and what unfolds is a battle of machine versus man (who, to be fair, uses machines) that astounds the eye and also strikes a few notes of pathos.  We see sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds, and while we may not entirely understand what that sacrifice is for in precise terms, it is clear that these people are sacrificing their own lives for the greater humanity.  And that is enough. <br /> <br />After the climax of this battle, Neo and Agent Smith have their much-ballyhooed mano-y-machino fisticuffs.  Please don't ask me to explain why this is the climactic fight, or even who really wins, but the visuals are undeniably amazing.   <br /> <br />The movie ends on an optimistic yet ambiguous note . . . will the War between man and machine continue?  Well, the problem is that since we're dealing with a storyline about futuristic computers and perception-versus-reality, there is nothing stopping the creators of \\"The Matrix\\" to spit out innumerable sequels that continually reexamine the same illogical themes.   <br /> <br />Well, the only speedbump is probably movie studio finances.  It's a troubling trilogy that concludes with a sense of, \\"We'll be right back here, provided the accountants can do a favorable cost-benefit analysis.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" ultimately goes out with a whimper rather than a bang . . . a spectacular, dizzying whimper, to be sure, but a whimper nevertheless.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I buy very few videos, as there aren't many movies I want to see repeatedly.  Intrigued by posters at the local video store, I rented \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" with the comment to my wife \\"This is either going to hilarious or incredibly stupid\\".  We agreed to give it a try and shut it off if we didn't care for it after 30 minutes.   <br /> <br />Well, we not only watched the end, but when we got done went back and watched parts again and two days later bought a copy.  The movie is best described as the Matrix crossed with \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" and a Bruce Lee movie mixed in.  Somehow it manages to be satirical, silly while being occasionally gripping, artful and even slightly (very slightly...very, very slightly) spiritual. <br /> <br />The movie is not perfect.  I would actually rate it 4.5 stars.  Some of the acting is uneven, the dialogue a little strange and occasionally it is just as dumb as I feared it might be.
B000AP04FG|4.0|well, i began this movie by expecting a complete waste of time, given the so-so reviews I'd seen by most critics when this baby was out in theaters. And within the first 20 minutes of the movie, I felt I was right as I was getting extremely bored with the pace of the movie. <br /> <br />Yet, once the action starts, it keeps going in such a way that it kept my interest all the way to the end. Great shoot out sequences and fights across the board, and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have wonderful chemistry onscreen.  <br /> <br />I guess my initial feelings still stand somewhat, since I find it incredibly hard to fathom different actors having such charisma as these 2 managed to pull for the audience. I think the movie would have been in real trouble just by simple miscasting. But together these two make a fantastic combo, and in the end, they are the ones that actually \\"make\\" this movie. <br /> <br />Recommended.
B0009NCQJ6|2.0|I have a couple complaints with this album. While it does contain some great music, it is hardly what I would call \\"The Best of Bond.\\"  Noticeably absent from this disc are several tracks from their first album, \\"Born,\\" which should have been included such as \\"Alexander The Great,\\" \\"The 1812,\\" \\"Winter,\\" and \\"Kismet.\\"  The last three songs on this disc do not appear on previous studio recordings.  In my opinion, a \\"Best of\\" album should contain the most popular songs from their previous recordings, and if there's room, 1-2 new songs that would definitely be considered for a \\"Best of\\" album in the future.  This recording just isn't their best works.<br /><br />The second big problem is the anti-piracy protection on this disc.  I use my computer to listen to music and this disc is unplayable in my computer. What a pain.<br /><br />If you own all the previous Bond albums, I would say to get this because the dual disc contains a DVD side with music video clips.  Those along with the 3 new songs make it worth it for me.  However I would not recommend this album to someone looking to get into their music, and I would not take it with me if I could only have one of their albums.  I would say that their first album, \\"Born,\\" is closer to a \\"Best of\\" than this CD.
B000AP04FG|1.0|Beautiful people to watch, lots of action and violence (if that's what you enjoy), but a disappointing screenplay and a somewhat incoherent plot.  As two married assassins who are ignorant about each other's profession, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are a good match, with lots of chemistry (obviously!), but this film doesn't do much for either of them.  The story had great potential, but wasn't written nearly as well as it could have been.  Despite Angelina's outstanding beauty, my husband walked out in the middle of the movie!  I stuck it out to the bitter end, but was very disappointed with the ending.  If you like a film with some substance, don't waste your time or money on this one.
B0002YLC24|3.0|A lot of changes have had happened since the making of \\"Before Sunrise\\".  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy has matured in their craft of film-making and now, they are behind the camera as much as in front of the camera.  Perhaps, the Director had more say to the direction nine years ago in making \\"Before Sunrise\\", in the sequel version of it, both actor, actress and the Director got themselves involved in the character development, screenplay and so forth.  Whilst the extra features in the DVD is far and between, it is sufficient to show us the bits where both actor and actress went through one scene (almost nine minutes long) in one take.  Both of them were obviously \\"in the zone\\" and they got the scene nailed.  Other than the fact that the dialogues were pacey, it's obvious that the dialogues were ridden of any corny or pretentious moments.  The characters simply talked as any long lost friends would have.  The superficial conversation were subsequently replaced by their private thoughts, and emotions were divulged.  Both characters wondered what would have been, the relationships they were in with other people despite their strong chemistry, and analysing the \\"what if\\" should they ended up together as they were supposed to.  Many reviewers came to conclusion that in the end, the couple came together but the ending was open-ended.  In accordance with the Director, with consensus from both actor and actress, this \\"Before...\\" franchise shall become a work-in-progress, a journal about love, of love that transcends time and place.  An honest and bittersweet love story that is beautifully crafted.  I'm sure there are many of us out there that would love to end up with the persons that we love.  Alas, as life would have it, circumstances at time would prevent the union.  Yet, it doesn't mean that the love would dissipate.  On contrary, it would burn stronger.  And with that, it gives us hope and with hope, we can look forward towards a brighter future.  Highly recommended
B0000033K2|5.0|I don't have too much to add that has not already been said about this wonderful box set of amazing music.<br /><br />Aside from containing all the tracks that make up the seminal albums, \\"Giant Steps\\" and \\"My Favorite Things,\\" this set really puts those albums in their musical context within John Coltrane's remarkable body of work.<br /><br />This set is a \\"must buy\\" both for Coltrane aficionados and for those looking to thoroughly explore his music. After intense introspection, I have to rank this set on an equal plane with the \\"Impulse! Complete Quartet Studio Recordings\\" CD set, yet above the Prestige recordings set.<br /><br />This is some fine, fine music and a great starting point for those looking to explore Coltrane's musical legacy.
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces, James Frey's memoir of his six week stay in a Minnesota Rehab Center is a stunning story that grips the reader and lets them feel his emotion.  At 23, Frey had been an alcoholic for 10 years, a drug user for 8 years and a crack addict for 3 years; his struggle seems unbearable, as using drugs was the only thing he knew how to do. <br /> Frey uses short, simple sentences to convey his feelings, \\"Although I have just been told that further use of alcohol or drugs will kill me, and kill me soon, what I want right now is a nice strong drink and a blast of rock.  I want them badly.  Get something.  I want them so badly.  Fill me.\\"  Other times, long descriptions give detail into Frey's harrowing life as a junkie, making the book itself hard to read, \\"My body lurches and I close my eyes and lean I forward.  Blood and bile and chunks of my stomach come pouring out from my mouth and my nose.  It gets stuck in my throat, in my nostrils, and what remains of my teeth.\\"  Downtime in the story is kept alive by the heartbreakingly colorful characters and their individual struggles.  He effectively develops these characters, including his girlfriend, Lily, and his mobster friend, Leonard.  Towards the end, you care as much about his friends as you do about Frey himself.  Frey makes his own, personal change very evident.  The depressed, drug-craved character at the beginning of the book gets replaced with a wiser, stronger character at the end.  Consequently, his tone at the end is different from that of the beginning; the last 150 pages are more optimistic and light hearted than the rest of the book.  Frey's unique writing style, which includes repetition and random capitalization, is a double edged sword.  At some points, the repetition makes his story more disturbing, like you are inside his head.  At other points, especially towards the end, I found the repetition itself to be repetitive and it was no longer as powerful.  Frey establishes ethos by beingbrutally honest, at one point listing the sins he has committed throughout his entire life.  Though he has committed some of the worst sins imaginable, you pull for him the entire book.  As a whole, the story flows very well.  He transitions between reality, dreams, and past events throughout the book without confusing the reader. <br /> Frey's unbelievable story keeps the reader on edge for all 430 pages.  His honesty, humor, and likeability leave no question as to why this book is a national bestseller.
B000127LW2|5.0|This is not only the best Star Trek series, but it is in my opinion the best show ever created. I love this show (all seven seasons) more than most anything in life. If I were born and then watched Voyager, I would consider my life to be complete and fulfilled. I simply love it that much. I can't imagine any other show that has ever been or ever will be created that can top Voyager. Plot, character development, cast, writing, and graphics (for the time) are all perfect. One must see STV at some point in his or her life in order to have truly lived.
0780622553|2.0|Let me start by saying that I love this movie. It is dark and atmospheric, with a storyline that is compelling. As well, naturally Jennifer Connelly beautifies any movie in which she appears. <br /> <br />My complaint is not with the content, it is with the encoding. As a previous reviewer has noted, this DVD does NOT contain a widescreen version of the film. Instead, it contains only a fullscreen version with the top and bottom cut off. What is the difference? <br /> <br />For those who own the DVD, look for yourself. Cue up scene 5 on the fullscreen version and note the edges of the billboard. Note that the woman's torso is fully visible, and that the letters \\"ACH\\" are completely visible (meaning the entire letters, top to bottom. They are not \\"chopped\\" at all). Now cue up the same scene on the so-called \\"widescreen\\" version and you will see that most of the woman's torso is gone; the letters are cut in half, etc. You are seeing exactly what you would see from the fullscreen version if you masked off the top and bottom of the screen. <br /> <br />In short, this is NOT a widescreen DVD at all. If you are expecting to see the original screen format you are going to be disappointed. Shame on New Line Cinema for putting out such a clearly fraudulent product.

B000088E6D|1.0|The trouble is, I DO get it with \\"Bubble\\".  I'm a former musician, and I have to say that in LA alone, there are hundreds of folks with voices BETTER than Bubble's. <br /> <br />But I DO get it. <br /> <br />He's a triumph of marketing, and his handlers, label and marketers clearly know his audience.  In that respect, he's no different than any of the other transparently marketed, lukewarm \\"talent\\" out there.  Take your pick - I'm sure any of the top 50 (or more) pop artists can \\"carry a tune.\\" <br /> <br />Now, I'm watching this kid try and instigate banter on his PBS show, talking to the camera, and it is pathetically forced, and quite frankly, he comes off as canned in the least.  Sorry, but Bubble is whitebread and mayo on top of it all.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|In a twisted way, this is a date movie, because you can talk about why people sometimes do such terrible things in a relationship.  Halfway through, I was ready to leave out of disgust because I thought this movie was simply people treating their lovers etc. poorly... then I realized that it was the point of the movie.  A great take on the emotional distance people on occasion deliberately put between each other.
B000002U9W|4.0|Sometimes I come late to a good party. Fortunately, \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is a good party that can be heard at your convenience. Though I was alive in 1970 when this album was released, I was unaware of the album's existence until many years later. Sad for me, but thank goodness for CDs! The album has aged somewhat, but perspective permits us to listen to the album with proper contextual references so that we can appreciate what we are hearing.<br /><br />Riding near the front edge of the initial wave of progressive rock is the opening track, \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" which is also the title of the album. Progressive rock was very new in 1970, having been presaged by the first progressive rock albums by the Moody Blues, \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and the psychedelic-progressive \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" and the album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson. Sometimes it was hard to separate progressive rock from psychedelic rock, and much of Pink Floyd's early music was psychedelic with influences that remain in this nearly twenty-four minute epic.<br /><br />This opening instrumental was supposedly going to be called \\"The Amazing Pudding.\\" However, a newspaper article about a pregnant mother with an atomic pacemaker and the headline \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" supposedly influenced the change of titles. The instrumental is separated into six parts titled:<br /><br />a. Father's Shout<br /><br />b. Breast Milky<br /><br />c. Mother Fore<br /><br />d. Funky Dung<br /><br />e. Mind Your Throats Please<br /><br />f. Remergence<br /><br />There are some disagreements as to the locations of these divisions, but in general, the parts seem to start around 00:00, 5:20, 10:09, 15:26, 17:44 and 19:49. This instrumental is as complicated and symphonic as progressive rock gets. There is an orchestra, a choir, sound effects, and more than a little rock noodling. I found portions of the first few minutes of this song similar to aspects of the track \\"Progress?\\" from \\"Chicago III,\\" which was released in the following year.<br /><br />It would have been easy for this concoction to go awry, and though there are a few moments where I wondered \\"what were they thinking?,\\" this work is not another ponderous attempt at avant-garde rock relevance; this instrumental strives to play with musical concepts to see what happens, aided by composer Ron Geesin. Is the opening track \\"great?\\" I am unable to answer that question. The opening track is very interesting, it requires many plays to appreciate, and it is very complex; all attributes of a great instrumental, but the song may be just a little too experimental. Fans of Pink Floyd will hear elements of later songs and instrumentals in this instrumental, which would make this instrumental a precursor of things to come and perhaps its greatness lies in what it inspired. I also hear elements that are now frequently attributes of New Age and World music. Pink Floyd was well ahead of its time with this experiment.<br /><br />After the existential opening, the following song clears the aural palate, so to speak. \\"If\\" is a lovely folk-flavored Roger Waters song that would have been at home anywhere last two-thirds of the 60s. The song has an interesting marriage of acoustic instruments with a significantly muted and haunting lead guitar.<br /><br />The next song makes me wonder if Pink Floyd was trying to recap the musical history of the 60s. \\"If\\" was styled as folk, which was very popular until about 1966. \\"Summer `68\\" recalls the famous summer of love that apparently was already yielding memories a year later. The song has just a touch of psychedelic and plenty of references to the hedonism and carefree attitudes of the time.<br /><br />The third and final song is \\"Fat Old Sun.\\" This song is one of the few Pink Floyd songs where I can clearly hear Beatles' influences. I could readily see this song on \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"The White Album.\\" The mellow style moves the implicit musical history into 1969 and 1970, setting up the very experimental final track, which may have been intended as the predicted style of things to come.<br /><br />The final instrumental is even more experimental than the opening instrumental. \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" was named for Alan Stiles, a roadie for the band. The three parts are listed as:<br /><br />a. Rise and Shine<br /><br />b. Sunny Side Up (Starting at 04:22)<br /><br />c. Morning Glory (Starting at 08:17)<br /><br />The theme of this instrumental is mundane; Alan Stiles is cooking breakfast. The kitchen sounds were recorded in Nick Mason's kitchen and are sprinkled throughout the track. The track shows how fearless groups were in this era in trying various concepts to see how they worked. This particular effort is cohesive throughout and an interesting listen. Music is poetry set to song, and in this case I think the effort was an attempt to set poetry to music. The voice parts in this track are Alan Stiles'.<br /><br />After looking back at this album I conclude that it was a transition effort for Pink Floyd. The group's earlier music was heavily influenced by Syd Barrett, and as music changed rapidly in the late 1960s Pink Floyd was inspired to stretch their creative wings. This album went to #55 in the U.S. and #1 in the United Kingdom, the first #1 for the group. There are places on this album that contain the seeds for works even as late as \\"The Division Bell.\\" In retrospect, this album may have been the launching pad for all that came after.tting up the very experimental final track, which may have been intended as the predicted style of things to come.  <br /> <br />The final instrumental is even more experimental than the opening instrumental. \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" was named for Alan Stiles, a roadie for the band.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Even if you don't like this movie, you gotta admit, it's at least different.  This movie has developed a large cult following, and to be honest I am not sure why certain people continue to spew quotes and think this is the greatest movie ever.  There are cute little nostalgic moments, such as the ridiculously long phone cord (some of you remember when phones had cords...)  So in conclusion, it's a good movie, but not a GREAT movie.
0887308589|5.0|I used to work for my native country's Tax Collection Authority and thought that all the management antics and sheer madness I witnessed -and many times I participated in- were exclusive to my organisation because it was a) a government office, and b) in a developing country. After three years I just couldn't take any more and left to do my PhD in the UK studying Information Technologies in bureaucratic organisations. I started reading Max Weber's classic writings on bureaucracy and some other scholarly works on the same topic, that drew from a number of theories ranging from rationality to institutional theory and Foucault on power and authority, which I found quite unconvincing. Then I came across \\"the Dilbert principle\\" in a second hand shop, bought it and couldn't put it down for three consecutive days. When I was done I realised that the management follies I experienced in my country were in fact the rule in most companies in the USA -and perhaps in the western world. I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or to cry, because this supposedly humorous book questions the very underlying assumptions of mainstream organisational theories (e.g., rational choice theory) using empirical evidence that is practically impossible to neglect, as most of us people who have worked can confirm. I'm delighted I found this book early in my PhD.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", is one of her best works or the Best, Period. <br /> <br />This disc remains true to her old school R&B roots, while also giving 21st century R&B/Hip-Hop hits.  <br /> <br />This is a CD in which all those involved, worked really hard to produce a instant classic! <br /> <br />I personally think 2 or 3 times before spending money on any CD for any artist. However, Mimi's new CD is worth every penny.  <br />It was so good, I also own the Ultra Platinum Edition, with 2 new tracks and 2 remixes... <br /> <br />Congratulations Mariah on a job well done! <br /> <br />
630514415X|5.0|Spike Lee is such a talented filmmaker, one wonders why he took such   a fine script, marvelous cinemotography, thematic complexity and consistently fine performances -- then perforated everything with gratuitous sex.      Certainly, professional scouts lure college athletes with excess, but the manner in which Lee drops sex into the action here limits the audience for an otherwise outstanding film and interrupts the emotional resonance its characters evoke.    The film recounts a convicted father's effort to free himself from  prison for accidently killing his wife. He does so by trying to persuade his son, a gifted basketball player,to attend the governor's university, \\"Big State,\\" because governor is a fan.    The film has layers of plot and meaning woven together seamlessly. There is a father's effort to redeem himself in his son's eyes , to do penance in memory of his beloved wife. In all, Lee recounts the process of forgiveness with compassion and accuracy.    Beneath these layers, Lee explores the Faustian drama of professional athletics in a corrupt society.  He exposes the manner in which business corporations and big education elevate athletic talent for their selfish ends, often asting aside decency and ethical sensibility.    The score, combining the music of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy, is oddly moving, without a trace of affectation.    Gratuitous sex aside -- this film confirms Spike Lee as one of our most moral filmmakers.  While his output is inconsistent, his great films are just that. They are permanent and well-crafted, ethically sound and constructive.    In his role as Jake, Denzel Washington turns out one of his greatest performances. Whether embroiled in violence or tenderness, there is a depth and vision to this actor that is rare and wonderful.    Recommended for mature audiences.
B0006L16N8|5.0|<br />That's what Coldplay seem to be doing these days. X&Y is a worthy follow-up to A Rush of Blood to the Head. \\"Square One\\" exudes confidence with soaring guitars and vocals, while \\"Talk\\" incorporates a Kraftwerk riff into an infectious chorus. Other highlights include \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Fix You\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"Low\\", \\"Twisted Logic\\", and the Johnny Cash tribute \\"Til Kingdom Come\\".
B0006FO8RA|1.0|Everyone knows who Britney Spears is.  I think more for the tabloid obsessions.  All tracks are well produced but too many sound too similar.  Proof positive that Britney is merely a manufactured product who has no writing talent or vocal talent. <br /> <br />Songs such as toxic sound painful to the ears and for those who need proof - check out her live concert.  I saw this on TV and there is no doubt that she cant sing to save her life. <br /> <br />This album is not consistant and has many weak tracks.  The rishi rich remix is a pathetic blast at bhangra and sounds like a cheap remix knocked off in one day.   <br /> <br />Dont waste your money on this record
B000B7BRMM|5.0|This jazzy Christmas CD is the swingiest from among my Christmas CD collection. Diana Krall's extraordinary vocal artistry and piano skills make her one of the gifted female jazz artists of today. She is, without a doubt, the Modern Day Jazz Diva.<br /><br />Backed up by a fantastic full jazz orchestra, The Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, Ms. Krall delivers a dozen of traditional Christmas carols with new flair and style. All her performances are remarkably stunning from the opener and the jazziest of all \\"Jingle Bells\\" to the last track and the least covered Christmas song by the great composer Irving Berlin, \\"Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep.\\"<br /><br />My favorites include all the noteworthy tracks - \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" \\"The Christmas Song,\\" \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\\" \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.\\"<br /><br />I merrily recommend this fabulous Christmas CD for your listening enjoyment. You'll enjoy it not only this time of the year but all-year-round as well if you're the type who enjoys Christmas music the whole year through - like a dear friend of mine who greatly influenced me to listen to Christmas music as early as June this year! ;)<br /><br />Have the Happiest Holidays ever!
B000001EXR|5.0|The album Carnival of souls is a surprisingly good album. <br /> <br />The tone is easily the darkest I have ever seen on any of there albums - except maybe Revenge.  Its amazing that none of these songs were performed on any of the recent tours.   <br /> <br />Eric Singer is in top form on drums, its great that we can hear Bruce sing for a change.   <br /> <br />The best song is the ballad 'I will be there'.  A deep emotional ballad that has its place at the top of the Kiss catalog.  Overall the album has a very dark tone to it.  The intro songs 'Hate and Rain' have a distinctive, heavy feel - kinda like 'unholy' from revenge. <br /> <br />I a very impressed with this album.  As a fan I liked the reunion tour and last years tour BUT this album shows that Kiss (i.e. the current lineup NOT ACE AND PETER) are more then capable of writing an album that is consistant with the time. (NOT stuck in the 70's as many die hards will only have it)  <br /> <br />A great album and I would like to see a dark heavy follow up in the near future - with or without makeup.

B00005ARDC|2.0|I've listend to the cd several times, since I realize that some get better with listening.  I don't hate it.  But it is nowhere near being even \\"good\\".  Whoever wrote this band is as good as the White Stripes should burn in a musically igonorant hell.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|It's safe to say that \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" at a whopping nine discs is one of the biggest sets of DVDs ever devoted to a specific series of theatrical releases. The package includes regular and special editions of each of the four \\"Alien\\" movies, plus five discs devoted to various bonus items. Whew! I'm not sure I found the eight movie versions and countless hours of extras worth all the fuss, but you can't say Fox was stingy about offering fans everything they could ever have wanted in an \\"Alien\\" set.<br /><br />Alien<br /><br />The last time I was scared by a film in a theater it was 1979 and \\"Alien.\\" Before that it was the 1963 adaptation of \\"The Haunting,\\" and when I was a kid it was \\"The House of Wax.\\" What do all of these films have in common besides fright? They're basically about haunted houses. That is, they are all set in enclosed areas with things largely unseen going bump in the night, then springing out and going \\"boo\\"! So \\"Alien\\" is more than a hair-raising sci-fi thriller; it's a darned good horror flick too.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott said that his idea for \\"Alien\\" was to make a kind of space truckers picture, featuring a crew of long-haul space jockeys on an interstellar cargo run. The gigantic space freighter makes a perfect stand-in for the old dark house of earlier times, and Scott is canny enough not to let the audience see too much of his monster until the very end. Even then we aren't sure what we've seen, except that it's really scary. The story plays on the principle that people are most frightened by things they don't see, that imagination can be more terrifying than reality, that suspense can be more hair-raising than mere shock. So when the cargo ship Nostromo accidentally picks up a deadly alien creature that keeps changing shape as it matures, we see the thing almost exclusively in the background, blending in among the shadows and ducts and hanging chains, only occasionally popping out to do its dirty deeds.<br /><br />The cast is a prime example of ensemble acting, with each performer formidable enough to carry the film alone, yet each working seamlessly with the others to produce an on-screen unit we care about. Sigourny Weaver stars as Lt. Ellen Ripley, a woman of sense and resource, whose heroic qualities would come to the fore even more strongly in the film's sequel, \\"Aliens.\\" Tom Skerritt plays the Captain, Dallas, a strong, charismatic personality who at first appears to be the main character, a notion squelched before the film gets too far along. Ian Holm is Ash, the science officer, a menacing presence with a cold, detached manner. John Hurt is Kane, the man who inadvertently brings the alien creature aboard the ship. Veronica Cartwright plays Lambert, the crew's most vulnerable character. And Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton play Parker and Brett (\\"Right\\"), the ship's maintenance team.<br /><br />Not least among the filmmakers is H.R. Giger. Much of the motion picture's creature design, set design, and artwork is based on his drawings. Giger is the fellow whose soft, round, intricately curving, often cold, yet fluid designs have influenced everything from video games to automobiles. His vision of the alien spacecraft is that of a gigantic womb and the alien monster's head a giant penis; viewers may make of this whatever they like.<br /><br />Finally, there is Mother, the ship's onboard computer, as vital, as comforting, and as sinister as HAL was in \\"2001.\\" Mother serves to remind us that the business corporations behind these intergalactic cargo operations value money and power over human lives.<br /><br />In addition to the regular theatrical release version of \\"Alien,\\" there is the Director's Cut, which Fox asked Scott to create by adding many of the scenes he had initially left out, including the famous cocooning scene. When Scott was finished with it, however, he thought it was too long and that the added material threw the pacing off. Therefore, he cut his own Director's Cut. The result of his tinkering is a freshly edited film that includes more new stuff and less old stuff, coming in one minute shorter than the original. Scott says he still prefers his original version, but now, at least, you have a choice of the two editions.<br /><br />\\"Alien\\" is among those films that did not get the best reviews when it first appeared but has since gained a reputation as a classic. The picture joins Scott's later \\"Blade Runner\\" in taking a while to catch on. I hope by now \\"Alien\\" doesn't need any further praise to ensure its place as one of the best sci-fi horror films ever made. Both versions of the movie get a Film Value rating from me of 9/10.<br /><br />Aliens<br /><br />\\"Aliens,\\" from 1986, is that rarity in Hollywood, the successful sequel. Its accomplishment is due in part because it retains the dark, brooding quality brought to it by its predecessor's director, Ridley Scott, and in part because its new director, James Cameron, completely changes its temper. Where \\"Alien\\" was largely a gothic horror flick, packed with suspense, \\"Aliens\\" is an action adventure, loaded with thrills. The notion that either of them is a science-fiction flick is entirely coincidental.<br /><br />As you know, at the end of the first film, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the sole survivor of an attack upon her interstellar cargo ship by an alien creature. She ended up getting into an escape module, scuttling the main spacecraft, placing herself into hibernation, and more or less hoping for the best. Fifty-seven years later she's finally picked up. Naturally, the company she works for is peeved that she blew up an expensive space freighter and is none too willing to believe her story about monsters. She gets stripped of her command, demoted, and humiliated. Things are tough all over.<br /><br />Then a snake shows up in the person of Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), who represents the corporation. He wants Ripley to return to the alien planet. Seems they have lost contact with the colony of settlers they sent up there some years before. Colonists? On the alien planet? Are they mad? With no little persuasion the company gets Ripley to go back, and the adventure starts all over again. Only this time, it's with a vengeance. There is no longer just one creature to deal with, but dozens, maybe hundreds of them. More is not necessarily better, but in this case it's just as good.<br /><br />The movie starts with a thrill a minute and works its way up. There's never a dull moment. The only blemish on the film is the crew of Colonial Marines that Ripley has to put up with. They are an embarrassment to an otherwise intelligent script, a group of gung-ho hotshots who are arrogant, immature, wisecracking show-offs with attitude. Their presence is meant to add color and excitement to the story, but, in fact, they are just plain silly. No serious military unit would put up with their antics for a minute. Among them is Hudson, a perpetual whiner, played by perpetual whiner Bill Paxton; Hicks, a reluctant hero, played by Michael Biehn; Gorman, a useless young lieutenant with almost no combat experience, played by William Hope; and yet another robot, Bishop, played by Lance Henriksen (\\"I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.\\") Finally, there is Newt, an adorable little girl they find on the planet, the only one to escape the alien creatures alive (or without being cocooned), who gives Ripley someone to mother. Ripley is clearly the only capable character in the bunch, and before long she takes over like Rambo. Maybe it's no coincidence that director Cameron was the screenwriter for \\"Rambo II\\" a year earlier. Ripley gets ample occasion to act heroically and, as usual, to run around in her underwear.<br /><br />Cameron adds a few surprises to \\"Aliens\\" to make it as different as possible from \\"Alien,\\" but basically it's the same idea. Just more ugly critters, some of the best monsters ever designed, by the way, and more action. It was the right route to take. We had already been served up the suspense of wondering what the alien creature was all about in the first story, so what was left was fighting a battle royal with a whole army of them. Even better, we not only get the original theatrical release but the newer Special Edition in which Cameron appended about twenty minutes of additional material, including scenes revealing Ripley's past and depicting the colonists' first discovery of the alien creatures. This is one film in either version that will definitely keep you awake. As with the first film, I have to give it a 9/10.<br /><br />Alien 3<br /><br />The third and fourth installments in the \\"Alien\\" series--\\"Alien 3\\" and \\"Alien Resurrection\\"--are every bit as bad as the first two movies are good. Not even director David Fincher, who went on to better things (\\"Seven,\\" \\"Fight Club\\"), was much help. In 1992's \\"Alien 3\\" the filmmakers actually seemed to be going out of their way to end the whole affair so they'd never have to make another sequel. They certainly do everything in their power to turn an audience off, not only by creating a painfully depressing atmosphere for their picture but by killing off every sympathetic character in sight, including the star! It didn't help, of course; they merely brought Sigourney Weaver back from the dead in the fourth movie. Never underestimate the power of money.<br /><br />You will recall that at the end of \\"Aliens,\\" Ripley was headed back to Earth along with her pal Hicks; the adorable little girl, Newt; and the faithful artificial person, Bishop. Well, sorry to disappoint anybody, but as soon as the new movie begins, her friends are already dead. Only Ripley survives. So much for sentiment. You know from the outset this trip isn't going to be pleasant. Ripley crash-lands on a near-deserted planet inhabited by only a few dozen people in an abandoned maximum security prison. Need I say she brings another alien creature along, unbeknownst to her, which soon runs amuck, picking off each character one by one? You're right; I didn't need to tell you.<br /><br />Weaver's supporting cast is weaker this time out, too. Where she had a strong group of individuals around her in \\"Alien\\" and a goofy troop of stereotypical hotshots in \\"Aliens,\\" in this third entry her fellow actors are almost nondescript. Charles Dance as Clemens, the prison doctor, comes closest to being an interesting character, but it doesn't last long. Charles Dutton as Dillon, the leader of the prisoners, is also in the running but has little to do. Brian Glover doesn't make much of an impression as a blustery prison superintendent. Not even the usually dependable Pete Postlethwaite stands out in this crowd. Part of the blame must go to the director, who seems to know only one speed, fast forward, and another part to the script, which is basically more of the same. Speaking of which, everything in the film even looks the same. The colors are the same, various shades of brown, the prisoners' uniforms are the same, and their facial appearance is the same, thanks to their shaved heads. To make matters worse, the filmmakers want to be sure that we won't find Ripley's looks any longer appealing, so Ripley shaves her head, too! It doesn't work. She's still attractive.<br /><br />Whether you watch the regular theatrical release or the new, thirty-minute longer Special Edition of \\"Alien 3\\" (an \\"assembly cut,\\" with rough patches in some parts of the dialogue that require subtitles), the film adds little beyond more blood and gore to mark its entry into the \\"Alien\\" canon. It is an insufferably dismal story of doom and gloom meant to close out the series forever. But didn't. If you are truly an \\"Alien\\" fan, you will want to quit after \\"Aliens\\" and assume that Ripley and her friends make it back to Earth safely. Just pretend the last two sequels didn't happen. Film value: 5/10.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection<br /><br />There are some people I've talked to who liked 1997s \\"Alien Resurrection\\" quite a lot, but they were young folks who had never seen the first two installments in the series or hadn't seen them in theaters. I suppose if you have nothing to compare \\"Resurrection\\" to, it might seem all right. In this final (one hopes) episode, it's two hundred years down the road from \\"Alien 3,\\" and Ripley is long gone. If only. No, she's been cloned, and the replica has an alien queen in her! I find that idea corny, but what are you going to do? Whatever; the reason she was cloned was to obtain a new alien creature and create an army of them. The half-human, cloned Ripley is then kept alive, and when the film begins we find her on a spaceship with the alien monster.<br /><br />By the way, about this ship. I mean, two hundred years of technological advancement have passed, and the spacecraft looks basically the same to me, inside and out, as the ones in the first two movies. Well, a dark, old haunted house is a dark, old haunted house.<br /><br />The main change in \\"Resurrection\\" is a weird mother-daughter relationship between Ripley and the alien, plus the usual assortment of supposedly colorful characters we have come to depend on. Another spaceship, you see, docks with Ripley's and it contains an assortment of grizzled occupants. There are also a few interesting set design variations to keep one entertained and some bizarre humor, but I'm not sure any of it is worth the trouble.<br /><br />Co-starring with Ms. Weaver this time out are Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Gary Dourdan, Michael Wincott, Dan Hedaya, Kim Flowers, J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, and, of all people, Winona Ryder. None of them are particularly noteworthy, but they all give it their best shot.<br /><br />Again, the viewer has the choice of watching the regular theatrical release or a new Special Edition, which director Jean-Pierre Jeunet calls an \\"alternative expanded cut.\\" It is about seven minutes longer than the original version and includes new opening and closing sequences. In the case of either version, the result is more of the same, with only a few differences in the cheeky wisecrack department.<br /><br />Neither of the last two movies has the suspense or thrills of the first two entries in the series. Film value: 5/10.<br /><br />Video:<br /><br />All four films are remastered to THX-certified standards in their original theatrical dimensions, all but \\"Aliens\\" presented in an anamorphic widescreen ratio measuring approximately 2.13:1. \\"Aliens,\\" the odd man out, is presented in a 1.74:1 anamorphic ratio.<br /><br />I found the video quality of the first, older film, \\"Alien,\\" the best of all, crisper and sharper than on any previous tape or disc incarnation I'd seen of it and better defined than the other three, newer \\"Alien\\" films. The other films seemed a little less well delineated, a tad softer, than \\"Alien.\\" I wondered why this might be the case, the older film looking better, and could only hypothesize that the older film being shorter might have needed less compression to fit two versions of it on one side of a disc. A check of the bit rates of the four films, however, revealed that they were all transferred with about the same amount of compression. Maybe the differences I saw were just in my mind's eye. In any event, all the films come off well, with only minor moir&eacute; effects noticeable here and there and occasional darker areas of the screen very slightly obscuring inner detail. Nothing to worry about. Certainly, the two newer films looked the cleanest. I'd give \\"Alien\\" a 9/10 and the others an 8/10 or 9/10.<br /><br />Audio:<br /><br />The THX-certified audio is presented in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. In DD 5.1 it ranged from good to brilliant. As expected, the sound quality gets better as the movies get newer. \\"Aliens,\\" originally recorded in Dolby Stereo, has fewer discrete surround effects, while \\"Alien Resurrection\\" has the most. All four films display ample frequency range and dynamic response, however, with the later movies sometimes shaking the rafters. Still, for me it was the small, delicate sounds that created the best atmosphere and suspense rather than the loud booms and crashes. For this reason, \\"Alien\\" still wins the day, regardless of its somewhat limited surround. I'd give the sound for \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" an 8/10 and the other two 9/10.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />The extras are found on four alternate discs (one disc of bonus items devoted to each movie), plus a fifth disc of sundry other supplemental materials. They make a formidable array of things to click on and seem designed to keep a viewer from buying anything else on DVD for at least a month, because that's how long you'll need to get through it all (providing you devote most of your life to it).<br /><br />Two things before we begin, though, one pleasant, the other annoying: (1) the number of individual bonus items is so large you're sure to wear your fingers ragged with punching buttons unless you choose the easy navigation system, whereby you can play all the featurettes or artwork or photos in one continuous sequence; and (2) the packaging has to be the most awkward ever devised for a DVD set. All nine discs are housed in a single, foldout box, which, when completely open, measures over five feet from end to end. Now, here's the problem: The whole thing starts fanning out in the middle, so in order to get to disc one, you have to unfold two-and-a-half feet of box. Worse, in order to reach the booklet insert, located in a pocket at the other end, you have to unfold another two-and-a-half feet! That's a nuisance, to say the least. Individual, slim-line double keep cases for each movie and one regular keep case, housed in much the same slipcase they use now, would have been more practical for the user. But perhaps Fox felt it would be too expensive.<br /><br />Anyway, here are a few of the items in the multitude of extras department: All four movie discs include THX Optimizer sets of audiovisual tests, English and Spanish spoken languages, English and Spanish subtitles, and from thirty-two to forty-four scene selections. I won't even attempt to cover all the rest of the things on the bonus discs--the reader can check out the \\"Disc Details\\" for that--but I'll highlight some major components I found interesting.<br /><br />Disc one contains the 1992 theatrical version of \\"Alien\\" (117 minutes) and the 2003 Director's Cut (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a short introduction by director Ridley Scott; an audio commentary with director Ridley Scott, writer Dan O'Bannon, executive producer Ronald Shusett, editor Terry Rawlings, actors Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt; plus optional deleted-footage markers to indicate where changes were made in the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Disc two contains the \\"Alien\\" supplemental materials. As with all four film-specific bonus discs, it is divided into three categories: Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. Within each category of each bonus disc, there is a plethora of documentaries, featurettes, multi-angle sequences, poster galleries, and still galleries. Among the things I liked best here were a thirty-one minute segment on \\"Creature Design\\"; an eighteen-minute segment on \\"Developing the Story\\"; a series of seven deleted or extended scenes; and a fourteen-minute bit on casting, \\"Truckers in Space.\\" Various cast members contribute their input via recent interviews. In all, there are about two dozen different bonus items on disc two.<br /><br />Disc three contains the 1986 theatrical version of \\"Aliens\\" (137 minutes) and the 1991 Special Edition (154 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director James Cameron, in which he admits to liking the Special Edition better than the original because he thinks it's \\"more intense\\"; an audio commentary with Cameron, producer Gale Anne Hurd, \\"Alien\\" effects creator Stan Winston, visual effects supervisors Dennis and Robert Skotak, miniature effects supervisor Pat McChung, actors Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and Christopher Henn; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.<br /><br />Disc four contains the \\"Aliens\\" supplemental materials. Among the many features here, I enjoyed \\"Preparing for Battle: Casting and Characterization,\\" seventeen minutes; \\"Beauty and the Bitch,\\" a twenty-two minute featurette; and \\"The Power of Real Tech\\" on visual effects, twenty-six minutes. Altogether, there are about twenty-three bonus items on disc four.<br /><br />Disc five contains the 1992 theatrical version of \\"Alien 3\\" (114 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (144 minutes). In addition, it contains an audio commentary with cinematographer Alex Thomson, editor Terry Rawlings, \\"Alien\\" effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects producer Richard Edlund, and actor Paul McGann; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition. No participation from director David Fincher, though. It's the only major ingredient the set lacks.<br /><br />Disc six contains the \\"Alien 3\\" supplemental materials. Among the best segments here are \\"Xeno-Erotic: H.R. Giger's Redesign,\\" ten minutes; \\"Adaptive Organism: Creature Design,\\" twenty minutes; and \\"Optical Fury: Visual Effects,\\" twenty-three minutes. In all, there are about twenty-four separate items on disc six.<br /><br />Disc seven contains the 1997 theatrical version of \\"Alien Resurrection\\" (109 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet; an audio commentary with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, editor Herve Schneid, \\"Alien\\" effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects supervisor Pitof, conceptual artist Sylvain Despretz, and actors Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, and Leland Orser; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.<br /><br />Disc eight contains the \\"Alien Resurrection\\" supplemental materials. Here I enjoyed \\"French Twist: Direction and Design,\\" twenty-six minutes; \\"Death from Below: Underwater Photography,\\" thirty-one minutes; and \\"A Matter of Scale: Miniature Photography,\\" twenty-two minutes. In all, disc eight holds about eighteen different bonus items.<br /><br />Disc nine contains the miscellaneous supplemental materials on all four movies, the best of which is the 2001 \\"Alien Evolution\\" documentary, which in a little over an hour covers just about everything you'd ever want to know about the making of \\"Alien.\\" For instance, director Scott admits his movie was inspired in part by \\"2001\\" and in part by \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\" According to creature designer Carlo Rambaldi, \\"Ridley Scott firmly believed that the more you see of the monster, the less frightening it becomes.\\" Exactly, which is why the first movie is scarier than the rest. The disc also contains shorter bits on the other movies, plus a whole lot of trailers, teasers, and TV spots; and, for the benefit of laser-disc lovers, all the bonuses found on the laser discs of \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens.\\" Finally, disc nine contains a gallery of \\"Alien\\" covers from the \\"Dark Horse\\" comic book series and a feature on Bob Burns's collection of \\"Alien\\" props and figures.<br /><br />Parting Thoughts:<br /><br />Assigning an overall \\"Film Value\\" rating to this set is a delicate task. If one takes into account the last two films, the rating would be much lower, so I'm ignoring them. My final 9/10 rating is based on the first two movies only and on the comprehensive nature of the extras.eople I've talked to who liked 1997s \\"Alien Resurrection\\" quite a lot, but they were young folks who had never seen the first two installments in the series or hadn't seen them in theaters. I suppose if you have nothing to compare \\"Resurrection\\" to, it might seem all right.

Another spaceship, you see, docks with Ripley's and it contains an assortment of grizzled occupants. There are also a few interesting set design variations to keep one entertained and some bizarre humor, but I'm not sure any of it is worth the trouble.  <br /> <br />Co-starring with Ms. Weaver this time out are Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Gary Dourdan, Michael Wincott, Dan Hedaya, Kim Flowers, J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, and, of all people, Winona Ryder. None of them are particularly noteworthy, but they all give it their best shot.  <br /> <br />Again, the viewer has the choice of watching the regular theatrical release or a new Special Edition, which director Jean-Pierre Jeunet calls an \\"alternative expanded cut.\\" It is about seven minutes longer than the original version and includes new opening and closing sequences. In the case of either version, the result is more of the same, with only a few differences in the cheeky wisecrack department.  <br /> <br />Neither of the last two movies has the suspense or thrills of the first two entries in the series. Film value: 5/10.  <br /> <br />Video:  <br />All four films are remastered to THX-certified standards in their original theatrical dimensions, all but \\"Aliens\\" presented in an anamorphic widescreen ratio measuring approximately 2.13:1. \\"Aliens,\\" the odd man out, is presented in a 1.74:1 anamorphic ratio.  <br /> <br />I found the video quality of the first, older film, \\"Alien,\\" the best of all, crisper and sharper than on any previous tape or disc incarnation I'd seen of it and better defined than the other three, newer \\"Alien\\" films. The other films seemed a little less well delineated, a tad softer, than \\"Alien.\\" I wondered why this might be the case, the older film looking better, and could only hypothesize that the older film being shorter might have needed less compression to fit two versions of it on one side of a disc. A check of the bit rates of the four films, however, revealed that they were all transferred with about the same amount of compression. Maybe the differences I saw were just in my mind's eye. In any event, all the films come off well, with only minor moir effects noticeable here and there and occasional darker areas of the screen very slightly obscuring inner detail. Nothing to worry about. Certainly, the two newer films looked the cleanest. I'd give \\"Alien\\" a 9/10 and the others an 8/10 or 9/10.  <br /> <br />Audio:  <br />The THX-certified audio is presented in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. In DD 5.1 it ranged from good to brilliant. As expected, the sound quality gets better as the movies get newer. \\"Aliens,\\" originally recorded in Dolby Stereo, has fewer discrete surround effects, while \\"Alien Resurrection\\" has the most. All four films display ample frequency range and dynamic response, however, with the later movies sometimes shaking the rafters. Still, for me it was the small, delicate sounds that created the best atmosphere and suspense rather than the loud booms and crashes. For this reason, \\"Alien\\" still wins the day, regardless of its somewhat limited surround. I'd give the sound for \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" an 8/10 and the other two 9/10.  <br /> <br />Extras:  <br />The extras are found on four alternate discs (one disc of bonus items devoted to each movie), plus a fifth disc of sundry other supplemental materials. They make a formidable array of things to click on and seem designed to keep a viewer from buying anything else on DVD for at least a month, because that's how long you'll need to get through it all (providing you devote most of your life to it).  <br /> <br />Two things before we begin, though, one pleasant, the other annoying: (1) the number of individual bonus items is so large you're sure to wear your fingers ragged with punching buttons unless you choose the easy navigation system, whereby you can play all the featurettes or artwork or photos in one continuous sequence; and (2) the packaging has to be the most awkward ever devised for a DVD set. All nine discs are housed in a single, foldout box, which, when completely open, measures over five feet from end to end. Now, here's the problem: The whole thing starts fanning out in the middle, so in order to get to disc one, you have to unfold two-and-a-half feet of box. Worse, in order to reach the booklet insert, located in a pocket at the other end, you have to unfold another two-and-a-half feet! That's a nuisance, to say the least. Individual, slim-line double keep cases for each movie and one regular keep case, housed in much the same slipcase they use now, would have been more practical for the user. But perhaps Fox felt it would be too expensive.  <br /> <br />Anyway, here are a few of the items in the multitude of extras department: All four movie discs include THX Optimizer sets of audiovisual tests, English and Spanish spoken languages, English and Spanish subtitles, and from thirty-two to forty-four scene selections. I won't even attempt to cover all the rest of the things on the bonus discs--the reader can check out the \\"Disc Details\\" for that--but I'll highlight some major components I found interesting.  <br /> <br />Disc one contains the 1992 theatrical version of \\"Alien\\" (117 minutes) and the 2003 Director's Cut (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a short introduction by director Ridley Scott; an audio commentary with director Ridley Scott, writer Dan O'Bannon, executive producer Ronald Shusett, editor Terry Rawlings, actors Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt; plus optional deleted-footage markers to indicate where changes were made in the Director's Cut.  <br /> <br />Disc two contains the \\"Alien\\" supplemental materials. As with all four film-specific bonus discs, it is divided into three categories: Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. Within each category of each bonus disc, there is a plethora of documentaries, featurettes, multi-angle sequences, poster galleries, and still galleries. Among the things I liked best here were a thirty-one minute segment on \\"Creature Design\\"; an eighteen-minute segment on \\"Developing the Story\\"; a series of seven deleted or extended scenes; and a fourteen-minute bit on casting, \\"Truckers in Space.\\" Various cast members contribute their input via recent interviews. In all, there are about two dozen different bonus items on disc two.  <br /> <br />Disc three contains the 1986 theatrical version of \\"Aliens\\" (137 minutes) and the 1991 Special Edition (154 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director James Cameron, in which he admits to liking the Special Edition better than the original because he thinks it's \\"more intense\\"; an audio commentary with Cameron, producer Gale Anne Hurd, \\"Alien\\" effects creator Stan Winston, visual effects supervisors Dennis and Robert Skotak, miniature effects supervisor Pat McChung, actors Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and Christopher Henn; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.  <br /> <br />Disc four contains the \\"Aliens\\" supplemental materials. Among the many features here, I enjoyed \\"Preparing for Battle: Casting and Characterization,\\" seventeen minutes; \\"Beauty and the Bitch,\\" a twenty-two minute featurette; and \\"The Power of Real Tech\\" on visual effects, twenty-six minutes. Altogether, there are about twenty-three bonus items on disc four.  <br /> <br />Disc five contains the 1992 theatrical version of \\"Alien 3\\" (114 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (144 minutes). In addition, it contains an audio commentary with cinematographer Alex Thomson, editor Terry Rawlings, \\"Alien\\" effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects producer Richard Edlund, and actor Paul McGann; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition. No participation from director David Fincher, though. It's the only major ingredient the set lacks.  <br /> <br />Disc six contains the \\"Alien 3\\" supplemental materials. Among the best segments here are \\"Xeno-Erotic: H.R. Giger's Redesign,\\" ten minutes; \\"Adaptive Organism: Creature Design,\\" twenty minutes; and \\"Optical Fury: Visual Effects,\\" twenty-three minutes. In all, there are about twenty-four separate items on disc six.  <br /> <br />Disc seven contains the 1997 theatrical version of \\"Alien Resurrection\\" (109 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet; an audio commentary with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, editor Herve Schneid, \\"Alien\\" effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects supervisor Pitof, conceptual artist Sylvain Despretz, and actors Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, and Leland Orser; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.  <br /> <br />Disc eight contains the \\"Alien Resurrection\\" supplemental materials. Here I enjoyed \\"French Twist: Direction and Design,\\" twenty-six minutes; \\"Death from Below: Underwater Photography,\\" thirty-one minutes; and \\"A Matter of Scale: Miniature Photography,\\" twenty-two minutes. In all, disc eight holds about eighteen different bonus items.  <br /> <br />Disc nine contains the miscellaneous supplemental materials on all four movies, the best of which is the 2001 \\"Alien Evolution\\" documentary, which in a little over an hour covers just about everything you'd ever want to know about the making of \\"Alien.\\" For instance, director Scott admits his movie was inspired in part by \\"2001\\" and in part by \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\" According to creature designer Carlo Rambaldi, \\"Ridley Scott firmly believed that the more you see of the monster, the less frightening it becomes.\\" Exactly, which is why the first movie is scarier than the rest. The disc also contains shorter bits on the other movies, plus a whole lot of trailers, teasers, and TV spots; and, for the benefit of laser-disc lovers, all the bonuses found on the laser discs of \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens.\\" Finally, disc nine contains a gallery of \\"Alien\\" covers from the \\"Dark Horse\\" comic book series and a feature on Bob Burns's collection of \\"Alien\\" props and figures.  <br /> <br />Parting Thoughts:  <br />Assigning an overall \\"Film Value\\" rating to this set is a delicate task. If one takes into account the last two films, the rating would be much lower, so I'm ignoring them. My final 9/10 rating is based on the first two movies only and on the comprehensive nature of the extras.  <br />
B00005JLD4|4.0|This is the story of a 1930s-era Australian government scheme to remove children of mixed race from their aboriginal setting.  The theory was that by inter-breeding them with whites, over time the aboriginal features would be bred out.  Such a condescending racial program naturally offends modern understanding.  Now focus on one strong and loving family and picture the police coming to take three young girls away.  I felt all the phsyical effects of social rage at something that happened nearly 75 years ago--and the movie was less than fifteen minutes from start. <br /> <br />So, yes, this is powerful stuff.  The girls are sent to a center, where they are to learn English, manners, and simple skills.  The girls escape, and begin a trek that will span 1200 miles through some of the roughest tarrain on earth. <br /> <br />The story flows naturally, and requires very little dialogue.  Yet, the story told is pregnant with meaning and emotion.  I felt as though I had been dropped into this era. <br /> <br />The story drags at times, though.  Additionally, the accents are sometimes difficult to decipher.  So, while the story is powerful, at times it also requires effort to engage. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Highly recommended true-to-life story that plays out naturally, respectfully, and authentically.
630521610X|5.0|I grew up watching horror films. I saw them too young and too many - and Michael Myers still scares the crap out me even when the film has nothing but crap left in itself. Writer Kevin Williamson clearly shares the same nervous fondness for the genre as myself (and clearly, many others) do - he has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up! oh heavens that wasn't supposed to happen!<br /><br />The movie begins with Drew Barrymore and goes somewhere totally different - and by the end you are so amazed that they took you there so adroitly, so smoothly, and yet with so many geniune yuks, you want to see it again! At least, that's how it was for me. The characters mock the very archetypes they end up playing - and they weave in and out of Red-Herringville with smooth abandon. A groovy cameo by the Fonz himself (as the high school principal) is a nice nod to we who have grown up freaking out that Freddy will come in our sleep. Watch for funny horror cameos and winks here and there.<br /><br />My favorite moment involves parallel action between the characters' viewing habits and the reality all around them. I don't want to give anything away but it involves a van, Jamie Kennedy, and Jamie Lee Curtis. It sums up what I love about Scream. It's smart, but it's not too smart - it hands you some information and hides other information - it dances around, pointing you in the direction it wants, but upon repeat viewing it doesn't suffer like movies like The Game do.<br /><br />Grab some friends, a big bowl of popcorn, check all the locks in your house...and obey all the rules! This movie makes 'em and breaks 'em! Woo hoo!
B000AY3KN0|5.0|You know King Kong is a classic. It started a movie genre, and the title ape is an icon. It inspired two remakes and countless spin-offs (from \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" and its remake to \\"King Kong Vs. Godzilla\\"). Its combination of great special effects plus story telling is something that still eludes most Hollywood blockbusters today. So I'm not going to rate the movie any longer, I'm going to rate the DVD. <br /> <br />And the DVD is fantastic. The movie looks gorgeous! I can't imagine how a 72-year-old movie can look any better. The same can be said of the sound, though unfortunately is in mono. The DVD and packaging extras are satisfying and complement the wonderful restoration. Some additions would have made this DVD perfect (surround sound, widescreen option) but as it is right now is worthy of the 8th Wonder of the World. Movie studios should check the work put on this DVD and take it as an example.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Inspirational, entertaining and gripping, Coach Carter is the first great movie of 2005, a memorable star vehicle for Samuel L. Jackson that may just go down in history as one of the best basketball movies ever made. You don't need to be a fan of the game to appreciate this tale of troubled youths being pushed to succeed and treat themselves with respect; all you have to be is human.<br /><br />Based on a true story, Jackson is Coach Ken Carter, a militaristic man's man who takes over a high school basketball team in the ghetto. With their selfish playing style and lack of respect for the game, the Richmond Oilers seem destined to repeat the previous season's win total of four. The new coach, however, brings with him an innovative program that requires them to make pledges including maintaining a 2.3 grade point average, attending class and sitting in the front row. When things start to turn around and the team puts together a historical winning streak, Coach Carter is forced to implement his academic policy by locking the team out of the gymnasium. It turns out that Coach Carter has a lot to teach these young men, and basketball is pretty far down the list.<br /><br />Veteran director Thomas Carter (Save the Last Dance) shows a real knack for avoiding the pitfalls of the sports movie by keeping the emphasis where it belongs: on the people. The scenes on the court are not only well-photographed and edited together, but they carry more emotional resonance because of the way that Carter juggles each storyline so effectively. As you get to know the coach and his team, it's impossible not to root for them; as he teaches them to respect others, strive for an education and lose their thug personas, it's even harder to disagree.<br /><br />The basketball players are a strong collection of young actors that includes Rob Brown (Finding Forrester), Robert Ri'chard (the upcoming House of Wax), Antwon Tanner (187) and Rick Gonzalez (Old School). Each leave lasting impressions, crafting characters whose lives and problems are worthy diversions when there's no ball to be seen. Gonzalez particularly impresses as the tough-talking Timo Cruz, a troubled youth at a crossroads who rejects Coach Carter's authority until he finds himself confronted with a tragedy.<br /><br />As Coach Carter talks to these boys, telling them that their future lies in their own hands and that the world wants them to fail, you can feel the inspirational words floating down off the screen and into the audience. This is the type of movie that can inspire kids to go to college, or just as easily get you to go home, type up that resume, and apply for a better job. There are few actors who could balance the abundance of strength and wisdom that Samuel L. Jackson brings to the role with the hipness that makes people want to listen to him.<br /><br />For Jackson, the part of Coach Carter should become the leading-man breakthrough he's been trying to have for years. When these kids greet their coach with the n-word and he responds by calling them 'sir', the character is in danger of becoming too stiff; when he responds to a dissenting student by pushing his face into the wall, the pendulum swings the other way towards fears of The Substitute 5. But Jackson walks the line so well that you can't imagine anyone else in the role. When he reminisces about his old glory days, you believe him; when he shows the importance of principles, you wish you could have his convictions. And when it comes time to convince us that his team wouldn't want to make him angry, well, he is Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />The only problems with Coach Carter stem from the ambiguous time period and a few subplots that are handled too carelessly. The real Coach Carter led his team to victory in 1999, yet this movie tries to remain relevant with several references to LeBron James, who was just beginning to make a splash that season. A storyline involving the singer Ashanti as a teenage girl pregnant by oneof the players goes too long and then is resolved far too neatly, and the mutually respectful relationship between the coach and his son Damien (Ri'chard) simply doesn't ring true for two men who seem so stubborn.<br /><br />In the end, Thomas Carter whips out a few tricks to throw our concept of the sports movie on its ear and remind us all that sports are a pastime to be appreciated, but also one that teaches valuable life lessons. How to buck the odds, how to make a lasting impression, how to inform without getting too preachy. These are lessons that could not only be taught by Samuel L. Jackson's titular coach, but by the director who shares his surname as well.egnant by one of the players goes too long and then is resolved far too neatly, and the mutually respectful relationship between the coach and his son Damien (Ri'chard) simply doesn't ring true for two men who seem so stubborn. <br /> <br />In the end, Thomas Carter whips out a few tricks to throw our concept of the sports movie on its ear and remind us all that sports are a pastime to be appreciated, but also one that teaches valuable life lessons.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|Only a hardcore Madonna fan will be interested in purchasing this album, as I did without having heard a single song.  It was a bitter disappointment after her really great album \\"American Life,\\" which had great tunes and great lyrics.  \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" hearkens back to the bland and boring style of \\"Ray of Light\\" without the benefit of interesting lyrics.  In fact, many of the lyrics sound like they were borrowed from other Madonna albums or even other people's songs.  The first few songs are interesting, but the album quickly becomes repetitious and dull.  You would do better to listen to the album a few songs at time (like in sets of three or four) to avoid being bored.  If you are looking for an album to prove to you what a great entertainer Madonna is, steer clear of this one!
6305903182|4.0|Normally, as a critic, we are exempt from the cost of seeing a movie. Normally, we get in for absolute zero when we attend a press screener of a film. However, since Dimension, for what appear to be highly mysterious (and controversial) reasons, cancelled the screener of Scream 3 I had to pay.<br /><br />This is one movie that I did not waste my money on.<br /><br />I saw this film in a theatre with about 700 other people, and the place was full to overflowing. Watching Scream 3 was reminiscent of watching a full-blown cult screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. People were dressed in full Mr. Ghost Face regalia (albeit without the knife), and the audience clapped, cheered, jeered, and chanted at practically every moment of the film.<br /><br />To imagine the theatre I was in, imagine the theatre in the first ten minutes of Scream 2, remove the homicide, and multiply by ten.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, seeing the movie in such a setting is probably for the best: I would have felt like such a silly ass loudly rooting for the killer in front of the rest of Cleveland's press contingent. My generation was raised on slasher flicks: they're our genre and our domain, and seeing Scream 3 with people of my generation was a refreshing switch from eating Thai food at the Ceder Lee cinemas with the rest of the critics.<br /><br />Of course, it wasn't just the overwhelmingly \\"this is campy, and I like it\\"-atmosphere that made me enjoy the film... Scream 3 wasn't half-bad either.<br /><br />Seeing as Dimension has already handed down their edict up on high from the Greenwich Village thrones of Bob and Harvey Weinstein that no one shall tell the details of Scream 3, and since I don't want them to have an excuse to bar the Internet critics from their next the-NSA-couldn't-break-this project, I will not tell you much. What I will tell you is this.<br /><br />Mr. Ghost Face is at it again. I obviously won't tell you who Mr. Ghost Face is, only that he has had a few upgrades. One, he can imitate people's voices (this is revealed within the first scene), and two, this guy packs a second knife (not revealed until later, but I thought you should know). This time he's killing the cast of Stab 3 in the order in which they die in the movie.<br /><br />Only one problem. Stab 3 and Scream 3 have comparable security levels, so Stab 3 has multiple drafts of the script so that no one quite knows who is going to be next. Of course, Mr. Ghost Face is going after whoever is left from the original cast (by now we have whittled it down to Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Liev Schreiber, and Neve Campbell) while he is at it.<br /><br />By far the campiest of the Scream trilogy, Scream 3 is undeniably fun. It isn't even structured so that it is guilty pleasure. It is structured so that it is following the rules of a sequel, not a trilogy, and thus everything is much more elaborately planned. The pace is quicker, the jokes are funnier, the IQ of the movie drops by at least 20 points.<br /><br />Scream 3 chooses as the target of its insults not the horror genre but the Hollywood system. Stab 3's cast is wonderfully postmodern (each person corresponds to a member of the surviving original cast), but plays its insults to actors, actresses, directors, and producers instead of to serial killers, shower scenes, axe murderers, and chesty victims.<br /><br />Ehren Kruger is able to step into the voice of Kevin Williamson without missing a beat, but is sadly not quite able to pull off a script without plot holes. The biggest thing that Scream 3 has going against it is the plethora of plot holes that exist in this film.<br /><br />But this is camp, and we don't care.<br /><br />In the end of Scream 3, when all is said and done, you are left with the feeling that you have just roasted marshmallows, made out in a drive-in, skinny-dipped in the lake, and done all of the other things that are both incredibly youthful and asking for it should you happen to find yourself in aserial-killer situation. The film is youthful. The film is Gen-X. But above all, it's fun, and it doesn't ever pretend to be anything more.pen to find yourself in a serial-killer situation. The film is youthful.

0440241588|4.0|This is the first John Grisham novel in years that I've just taken time to enjoy, rather than pick apart.  I'm well aware that if I spend too much time thinking about it, the whole story is going to fall apart.  But this is Grand Cartoon Politics Grisham, a la \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Brethren\\", with all sorts of appearances by Presidents and the CIA and the FBI and elaborate federal stings and foreign locales.  Even the Mossad gets involved!  It's like \\"24\\" in book form! <br /> <br />Actually, this is Grisham continuing his introspective trend.  Again, as in \\"The Last Juror\\", there's no multi-million dollar fortune at stake, and there's a surprisingly low body count.  This time, big-shot Washington lawyer Joel Backman tries to sell some purloined technology to the Pentagon, and goes to prison.  Six years later, a lame-duck President in his final hours of office (is this the same guy from \\"The Brethren\\"?) caves in to CIA pressure and pardons Backman.  The CIA set Backman up in Italy and keep him on a very short leash, waiting to see which foreign government will take him out first. <br /> <br />Most of the foreign spies are mentioned, but never seen; the Mossad show up for a few chapters but don't flex too many muscles.  There's some James Bondian spy satellite technology, but the exotic female spies are only heard about, never seen.  No-one dies for hundreds and hundreds of pages, and when there is a killing, the perpetrator isn't a treacherous foreigner. <br /> <br />The point here is that Grishman is not rewriting Tom Clancy, but rather telling Backman's story -- one of humility learned, redemption found, and family rediscovered.  The storytelling, as always, is direct and fast-paced.  Even when Backman spends 150 tension-free pages in Italy, trying to learn a foreign language and live by his wits for the first time ever, the narrative does not lose steam. <br /> <br />Strangely enough, this book only slows down once Backman reluctantly leaves his hideout andinevitably faces down his numerous would-be assassins.  As with \\"The Pelican Brief\\" (the book, not the movie), there is no real climax... unless you count a desperate fugitive telling his story in a quiet room to be an action packed page-turner. <br /> <br />I think the point is that Grisham is trying to tell a true-life story, that doesn't end with a gunfight or bloodshed.  He's using the cartoon politics, the cutting-edge technology he made up, and the exotic locales, but not to be edgy.  He's only telling the heart-warming tale of a lawyer who makes good.  It's good to see that Grisham can actually sell this story under the banner of a two-fisted spy novel, and make it work.
B00000ILDE|5.0|\\"Aliens,\\" from 1986, is that rarity in Hollywood, the successful sequel. Its accomplishment is due in part because it retains the dark, brooding quality brought to it by its predecessor's director, Ridley Scott, and in part because its new director, James Cameron, completely changes its temper. Where \\"Alien\\" was largely a gothic horror flick, packed with suspense, \\"Aliens\\" is an action adventure, loaded with thrills. The notion that either of them is a science-fiction flick is entirely coincidental.<br /><br />As you know, at the end of the first film, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the sole survivor of an attack upon her interstellar cargo ship by an alien creature. She ended up getting into an escape module, scuttling the main spacecraft, placing herself into hibernation, and more or less hoping for the best. Fifty-seven years later she's finally picked up. Naturally, the company she works for is peeved that she blew up an expensive space freighter and is none too willing to believe her story about monsters. She gets stripped of her command, demoted, and humiliated. Things are tough all over.<br /><br />Then a snake shows up in the person of Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), who represents the corporation. He wants Ripley to return to the alien planet. Seems they have lost contact with the colony of settlers they sent up there some years before. Colonists? On the alien planet? Are they mad? With no little persuasion the company gets Ripley to go back, and the adventure starts all over again. Only this time, it's with a vengeance. There is no longer just one creature to deal with, but dozens, maybe hundreds of them. More is not necessarily better, but in this case it's just as good.<br /><br />The movie starts with a thrill a minute and works its way up. There's never a dull moment. The only blemish on the film is the crew of Colonial Marines that Ripley has to put up with. They are an embarrassment to an otherwise intelligent script, a group of gung-ho hotshots who are arrogant, immature, wisecracking show-offs with attitude. Their presence is meant to add color and excitement to the story, but, in fact, they are just plain silly. No serious military unit would put up with their antics for a minute. Among them is Hudson, a perpetual whiner, played by perpetual whiner Bill Paxton; Hicks, a reluctant hero, played by Michael Biehn; Gorman, a useless young lieutenant with almost no combat experience, played by William Hope; and yet another robot, Bishop, played by Lance Henriksen (\\"I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.\\") Finally, there is Newt, an adorable little girl they find on the planet, the only one to escape the alien creatures alive (or without being cocooned), who gives Ripley someone to mother. Ripley is clearly the only capable character in the bunch, and before long she takes over like Rambo. Maybe it's no coincidence that director Cameron was the screenwriter for \\"Rambo II\\" a year earlier. Ripley gets ample occasion to act heroically and, as usual, to run around in her underwear.<br /><br />Cameron adds a few surprises to \\"Aliens\\" to make it as different as possible from \\"Alien,\\" but basically it's the same idea. Just more ugly critters, some of the best monsters ever designed, by the way, and more action. It was the right route to take. We had already been served up the suspense of wondering what the alien creature was all about in the first story, so what was left was fighting a battle royal with a whole army of them. Even better, we not only get the original theatrical release but the newer Special Edition in which Cameron appended about twenty minutes of additional material, including scenes revealing Ripley's past and depicting the colonists' first discovery of the alien creatures. This is one film in either version that will definitely keep you awake. As with the first film, I have to give it a 9/10.hotshots who are arrogant, immature, wisecracking show-offs with attitude.

We had already been served up the suspense of wondering what the alien creature was all about in the first story, so what was left was fighting a battle royal with a whole army of them. Even better, we not only get the original theatrical release but the newer Special Edition in which Cameron appended about twenty minutes of additional material, including scenes revealing Ripley's past and depicting the colonists' first discovery of the alien creatures. This is one film in either version that will definitely keep you awake. As with the first film, I have to give it a 9/10.  <br />
B000002504|4.0|After hearing and reading fantastic things about this band, I decided to give GG a try with this album. I don't know if I reccomend following my route. My immediate reaction to Octopus was a negative one. I felt like a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle fell off a high shelf and dumped on my head. There are half a billion complex intricacies here topped off with some  unique vocals which are not easily appreciated upon introduction.   <br /> <br />I almost packed the disk off to my girlfriend's Tull loving father out in Utah.  <br /> <br />I am so thankful that I did not follow through. To the uninitiated this music fights for your respect... when it finally \\"clicks\\" it is wonderful.  I kid you not I started humming some of these melodies in my sleep and at work. I had to scan thru my iPod to figure out what I was humming. <br /> <br />Honestly I do not play the heck out of Octopus, but I did purchase a handful of Gentle Giant's other albums which I liked right away.  To the new and curious such as myself, I don't advise starting out with Octopus. <br /> <br />I do think Gentle Giant is brilliant... I had no plan on becoming a fan... they won my respect fair and square.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is set in a future where humanity faces destruction at the hands of an aggressive alien society like that of an insect colony of our world.  Faced with impossible odds, humanity, prepares to fight the next war by training the world's adolescent geniuses at the Battle School to become the next Alexander, Napoleon, and Lee.  Six year old, Ender Wiggin, genius among geniuses, is recruited to join the Battle School.  We follow Ender through his training, as he proves that he is the best of the best, systematically and remorselessly beating his opponents to the ground. <br /> <br />In his novel of Ender's growth into maturity and into taking responsibility for his gift, Card portrays several powerful themes, which he expands and addresses in the novel.  The first is the utter desperation that causes humanity's turn to innocent children to lead the armies of tomorrow.  This complete breakdown in the teaching of children shows the breakdown of normal society.  The second theme is the powerful alienation and loneliness that helps Ender fully develop his brilliance.  He has no friends, merely those who willingly serve him, fanatics who would do anything to follow the will of their commander.  And lastly, the novel tackles the cold hearted relentless pressure that is applied to Ender, because he is Earth's last hope. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is a great science fiction novel that provides a glimpse into a dark future, where only hope remains.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As book to movie adaptions go this one of the best made.  A brilliantly made movie that brings the young harry potter to Hogwarts for the first time.  Harry find for the first time friends among wizards and witches, who they all know the name and legend of Harry potter, the boy who lived.  A excellent family film that everyone will enjoy to watch with their kids.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|i didnt know at first if this was good or not. I came to the conclusion it was less good than i first thought. Usually i know if an album is good if it either A.)knocks my socks off from first listen, or B.) grows on me with each consecutive listening. This record did neither for me. I listened through a few times and have not really felt like relistening to it very much. Just didnt intrigue me, or keep me very interested for long.
B00004Z459|2.0|this band is wayy to over played, they get on my nerves, they rap to much, the only reason i gave them 2 stars is cause of \\"One Step Closer\\". It's their heaviest song, and its with screaming and all. so i kinda dig it...other than that, they have like videos for every song, they collaborated with Jay-Z which made me loose all respect for them, even though there wasnt much to begin with, and overall im glad i burned this CD instead of buying it....dont waste your money
B000B8QEZG|3.0|First and foremost, I'm reviewing this album, not Madonna or making comparisons to other singers.  \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is Madonna's 11th. studio album.  There are some good songs on here, one or two great songs, and the rest are just mediocre.  It hurts me to say that as I've truly loved everything Madonna's put out, but these songs are strictly for the present, not for the ages.  10 years from now, I think few people will remember any songs from this album other than \\"Hung Up\\" or possibly \\"Sorry.\\" <br /> <br />At first it was hard for me to put my finger on what's wrong here.  It's good, and could be really great, but something's amiss.  The problem is not the \\"European sound\\" or the homage to disco, ABBA, or Moroder.  It's that the album lacks a soul--there's no meat here.  It's not that any depth is needed here on an all-dance album (which it really isn't), but there's no feeling anywhere on this album.  Other reviews I've read (where the writer has actually listened to album more than a few times) have said things that ring very true to me.  The album as a whole feels rushed, giving it a cheap, plastic-like feel.  Also the songs (aside from \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", and possibly \\"Jump\\") feel unfinished--like they're demos or not-so-good remixes.  \\"I Love New York\\" isn't very good, but you can feel and hear potential in the song.  Honestly, the snippet of the song you hear in \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" (Madonna's latest documentary) is much more polished and at the very least, has a better chorus.  \\"Get Together\\", \\"Isaac\\", \\"Like It Or Not\\", the clumsily titled \\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"How High\\" and \\"Push\\" are pretty decent songs, but as I stated before: forgettable, but they have some potential. <br /> <br />Another review I read, perhaps on Madonna's fan club board, hit the nail on the head.  This is not so much a Madonna album, as it's a Stuart Price album featuring Madonna on vocals.  My other problem with this album is that all the songsflow into one another like a DJ set.  I wouldn't have a problem with that if it was done well, but out of the 11 times the songs segue into one another--it only feels right once or twice.  The other times, it feels uninspired and forced.  On iTunes, there is an option to buy the songs separately as \\"Album Versions\\" giving each song it's own beginning and end.  In some cases, I think a song benefits by not being married to the tracks before and after it; in others, the track is still without a proper intro and outro--making it a fragmented song. <br /> <br />THE BOTTOM LINE:  Is this an album you should buy?  Well, if you're a fan, you already have it.  If you're just a casual fan of Madonna or just dance/pop music in general,  then pick it up for under $10.  If you only like her older stuff, you may be disappointed.  I suggest you buy a song or two from iTunes as a test-drive.  This is not a bad album, but it's not great.  I still think her \\"American Life\\" album is her strongest record since \\"Ray of Light\\" that suffered from bad timing, poor marketing, all sorts of misconceptions, and a weak lead-single. <br /> <br />NOTE: If you belong to Madonna's fan club, ICON, you can get a bonus track that was a cut from the \\"Confessions...\\" sessions called \\"Super Pop.\\"  This is a pretty decent song that really should have been included on the album as it's more of a dance song than \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Like It Or Not.\\"  The special edition of \\"Confessions...\\" comes out on December 13, 2005 and includes another bonus track called \\"Fighting Spirit.\\"
B00005JNZJ|4.0|This movie beats 88% of the hogwash that's out there. <br />I can't believe how poorly it was rated by sour-grapes critics. <br />As of Aeon Flux, the credibility of the current mainstream movie critics is over. O-v-e-r. (blogs and amazon for me from now on) <br />Great action; Fantastic original sets; Charlize' wowee acrobatics. Man I liked the movie a lot. I really did, and I had really low expectations and was a fan of the original. <br />This movie will make you think. Don't let anyone tell you the ending!
B000BBOUU4|4.0|The next movie I am going to review, is one that I had wanted to see in the movie theatres, but a member of a movie club, that my family (not me) is in, the movie was picked as a surpise, I didn't even think it would have been picked. And so I was ditched, by my family, but I knew that I had to see it on dvd. <br /> <br />The first movie was called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, this one is called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which is more appriotaly titled, since Charlie is the main character. The first 35 minutes I feel were rushed, because by that point they were in line at the factory, in the older version, it was about a hour before that happened, and there were all these musical numbers that took some time. The first movie ran 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie runs 1 hour and 55 minutes. As the movie begins, we meet the hero of this story Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) who lives with his Mom (Helena Bonham Carter) and Dad (Noah Taylor), and his grandparents Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) , Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith) , Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell) , and Grandpa George (David Morris). Ealry in the movie, we learn that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) decided top open his own Chocolate Factory, after he leaves home, and he hires workers, and then spies, come in dressed as workers, to steal Willy Wonka's secret recpies. And that leads Willy Wonka to annouce that he is closing his Chocolate Factory, and he looks the gate, and all the workers inclduing Grandpa Joe out of a job. But then the Factory starts up again full blast, but the gates stayed locked at the factory, so nobody can steal his secret repies, and the good question is who is helping Mr. Wonka work the factory? But then Mr. Wonka makes a sudden annoucement, he plans to open his factory to 5 children, and take them on a tour himself of the Chocolate Factory. Deep Roy plays all the Oompa-Loompas himslef in the movie, and the singing is done by Danny Elfman.
B0002I831S|3.0|While I am a long time fan of Star Trek and give the series itself 5 STARS, these DVD's were poorly organized. The episodes are entirrely out of order. Spock would call it illogical at best. I have yet to figure out what method they used to organize the episodes. I've never seen a DVD box set of a television show that did not order the episodes in chronological order. In addition, this set does NOT include the pilot episode, \\"The Cage.\\" Technically not part of season 1, but still a must.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|First off any KoRn fan will appreciate this effort to make a 7th album even after losing Brian \\"Head\\", this album is full of good songs and a few bad ones....like most other reviewers some of the high points are songs like politics and hypocrite, but you can't count out coming undone or getting off either, because they are just powerful songs. <br /> <br />The best song on the album is by far \\"Liar\\" it has old school korn and new korn all in one, its just amazing. <br /> <br />Track ratings <br /> <br />1. Twisted Transister - 4/5 A great song from start to finish, catchy riffs, lyrics, and a sing along kinda feel to it. <br /> <br />2. Politics 6/5 - second best song on the album, from start to finish it'll make you shake your head up and down and make you hate the world of politics with the greed and corruption that occurs. <br /> <br />3. Hypocrites - 5/5 - another great song dealing with issues outside of jon's depression, religious symbols make it a great song <br /> <br />4. Souvenir - 3/5 - a song for the old korn fans heavy and hard, but the lyrics are a little weak i think, and sounds alot like issues/untouchables clashing. <br /> <br />5. 10 or a 2 way - 3.5/5 - not a bad song dark and ambient, slow guitars and smooth bass, great lyrics, great vocalization, and drums! <br /> <br />6. Throw me Away - 4/5 not a bad attempt at a ballad for KoRn, one of the more amazing songs on the album, very different from what we as kornkids are used to. Good lyrics + good sound = good song. <br /> <br />7. Love Song - 4/5 This is actually one of my favorites on the album, reminds me of when Jon worked on Queen of the Damned, great works there also. <br /> <br />8. Open Up - 2/5 - i don't think i like this song it just doesn't seem like KoRn to me, lyrics are ok so i have to give credit to something. <br /> <br />9. Coming Undone 5/5 - This is a new sound for KoRn and i think it works really well for them i would like more from this sound outa Korn. and the lyrics are awesome. <br /> <br />10. Getting Off - 6/5 I LOVE THIS SONG......its a great powerful song about getting off, i love it  <br /> <br />11. Liar 10/5 - By far the best song on the album, great for old school fans as well as new school ones, like the first time since freak on a leash we get to hear jon's jibberish!!! <br /> <br />12. For No One - 5/5 - i like this song too, its a good song, good lyrics!!! good sound, alot like old korn!! <br /> <br />13. Seen it All - 4/5 - this is a good song, but not a great song, could have been better with a little harder, heavier at times. <br /> <br />14. Tearjerker - 7/5 This is a very experimental sound for korn its very consintrated on jon's vocal power, and surprisingly he pulls it off with flying colors. <br /> <br />B-sides Bonous disc <br /> <br />1. Too late I'm dead - 5/5 should have been on the album instead of souvenir. <br /> <br />2. Eaten up inside - 4/5 good song, sing song kinda feel. <br /> <br />3. Appears 6/5 - another song that should have been on the album originally. <br /> <br />4. Last Lega; Drug - 5/5 another love song about love, great and better then 10 or a 2 way!!! <br /> <br />Over all i think that this album is better then most but not one of the best!!
B0002OERI0|2.0|I don't understand what everyone if freaking out about this album. I got it and it isn't very groundbreaking. If you want groundbreaking, go buy Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" or Metallica's \\"Master Of Puppets\\".  <br />Anyways, alot of the songs on here are highly annoying (read: Wake Me Up When September Ends). This album also features alot of blindly political songs, like Holiday and American Idiot. Holiday doesn't even make sense. If you want an angery politically charged album you are looking at the wrong place. Go to Metallica's \\"...And Justice For All\\" or any Rage Against The Machine album.
B00006690G|5.0|This album had songs that really hit home. Some songs really spoke to me, like Sing for the Moment. I guess not all the songs were top notch, but this album holds a deeper meaning for me.
B0006399FS|1.0|WARNING!!!!!!: This album lacks everything a album should have, musically and lyrically. I hate this crap. This is a great Christmas gift to someone you really hate and wish they would die, but to be polite just get them this album and consider them doomed. <br /> <br />Consider yourself warned <br />
B00002DE0S|5.0|These concertos were written by a young man in love. In 1830, at the age of 19, Chopin was smitten with the young Polish soprano Konstancja Gladkowska, and he credits her as the inspiration for his two Concertos for Piano and Orchestra, composed during that year. He wrote to a friend: \\"This is a young, pretty person, who plays, because, perhaps unfortunately, I have my ideal that I have been faithfully serving for six months already without speaking to her, of whom I dream, in honor of whom is the adagio to my concerto...\\" The youthful, melancholic passion of his first, yet unrequited love is certainly reflected in the concertos, especially in the slow movements, which Chopin described in the following words: \\"It is rather romantic, peaceful, melancholic.  It should give the impression of a loving glance at a place which brings a thousand dear memories to mind.  It is a kind of reverie on a beautiful vernal night, by moonlight.\\" <br /> <br />One of the most remarkable things about Chopin is that as a composer he grew to his full potential very early in life. By the time he composed these concertos at the age of just 19, he had already developed his own completely unique pianistic idiom, quite unlike any composer before or since: like Athena springing forth fully formed from the head of Zeus. The mazurka in the finale of the Second Concerto; the romantic nocturne-like slow movements; the graceful, delicate, aristocratic embellishments: it's all pure, unadulterated Chopin. He never composed a single piece of music that did not feature the piano, and he was the author of only a small handful of works for piano and orchestra. Preferring to work in the smaller forms, Chopin is not so much remembered today for his orchestrations, which are sometimes even re-composed by those who find fault with them. But one must remember that the piano concertos were written as a labor of love, and that even if the orchestrations are not perfect, they should be treated delicately and with the same love that Chopin himself put into them. <br /> <br />This is the sensitive new approach that Krystian Zimerman and the Polish Festival Orchestra adopt in their landmark interpretation of the Chopin Piano Concertos. Zimerman hand-picked each and every member of his orchestra from among the finest young musicians in Poland, with the specific purpose of holding a world tour of the concertos on the 150th anniversary of Chopin's death. This recording is the result of that tour, and is nothing short of a visionary musical masterpiece. As both conductor and soloist, Zimerman blends the orchestral sound perfectly with his own performance, capturing every nuance with adroit delicacy, perfectly dovetailing every phrase. I never doubted Zimerman's virtuosity before, but this recording fixes him firmly in my mind as one of the greatest pianists of our time. His attitude towards the music is truly one of love and humility before the composer, rather than \\"How fast can I play this?\\" or \\"How can I use this piece to show off?\\" His attention to detail is amazing: listening to his performance one gets the sense that he has come to a complete understanding of Chopin's music, capturing the idiom of the composer perfectly, and leaving the listener feeling a profound sense of \\"rightness.\\" The music on these discs leaves a very lasting impression, and I encourage anyone interested to listen to these recordings and experience the definitive interpretation of Chopin's Piano Concertos.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|First, I'm a 15 years old girl who is lucky enough to have a chance to watch the original theatrical release version of these films on my dad's old laser discs , and I have to say that the current \\"improvement\\" is really bad. Mr. Lucas has screwed up big time. The CGI looks very fake to me and I actually think the old special effects (miniature models and all that) looks much more realistic in most cases. Moreover, there are a lot of changes, and most of them are for the worse. It is interesting, though, to compare shot by shot of the improved versions on DVD vs. the originals on laser discs. Oh, well, I'm going to sell this DVD box set on eBay and hope one day the orginal theatrical versions will be out on DVD.
B00001ODGR|2.0|This DVD is not real great sounding, given that it was recorded before the full scale digital recording revolution took place! <br />The music sounds fair but needs to be upgraded to digital quality with re-mixing the original tapes and video! <br />Other than that the concert it self isn't much to watch, to much power tripping for the old styx leader of the band!!!
0060764899|5.0|Lewis is amazing in many respects, one of the reasons is his ability to adapt to his audience that he is writing to. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an amazing extension of who Lewis was. The book itself is seamless and flows from beginning to end. Lewis creates characters that are real and fun, leaving you able to become involved with the story. <br /> <br />Aslan is a great hero, evoking a strong and protective, just and right lion who is the people's champion. Throw in the evil white witch and some naive Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve and you have a tale worth reading. The ending is very clever (especially since Lewis foreshadowed it) as Aslan brings an army to the battlefield. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. Lewis says it in his opening acknowledgment. This is a fairy tale meant for children, or for an adult willing to sit down and enjoy a fairy tale, for that is what it is. Don't mistake this for a full blown fantasy series and book. The descriptions are short and concise, the characters are black and white, and the outcome is fun. That being said, there is no reason why this book, or series, cannot be enjoyed by an adult. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially to be read before the movie. <br />
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|A very tasteful selection of new & old songs, with the band mebers always giving full uotput for their concert! <br />Excellent music and video captures the Eagles together again just like they never missed playing a tune while away from each other!

B000021Y7X|5.0|Excellent time piece caught on film of one of musics most creative forces!!! I thought the DVD was awesome and sounded great, this is the Talking Heads at there highest level of entertainment that I've ever seen! <br />There is so much energy flowing out of this concert all through the video, not to many bands can run, jump, lay down, play their songs without losing a beat!!!
B0000683WG|5.0|'The Slider' is my second favorite T. rex album and it might just be number 1 if I keep listening to it, as I have for the last couple days. The excellent producing and hard driving sound makes me wonder how the band managed not to attract the kind of attention Led Zepplin did in the U.S. Bolan's lyrics are strange and effective and have some interesting references hidden away - making the music sound deceptively simple.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I love Enya and love her beautiful music - no one does music like her. I have to admit that I was too anxious for a new Enya cd. <br /> <br />When I listen to 'Sumiregusa' (for a japanese commercial) - last Spring I was too excited. <br />And when I was listenning to this new Amarantine I get a little disappointed. <br /> <br />There ARE very beautiful songs - in fact all of them, but the ones that impressed me the most are: 'Less Than A Pearl', 'Amarantine', 'The River Sings', 'Sumiregusa(Wild Violet)' and 'Drifting'. <br /> <br />Some of the best tracks - especially tracks 1 and 5 - are sung, not in english, nor gaelic, nor quenya or anykind of elvish (The Lord Of The Rings), nor any language we know... but Loxian Language - created by lyricist Roma Ryan(!) These are the most sublime tracks on the entire cd and the most satisfying ones too. <br />This new language - Loxian - you can find more details on the book by Roma Ryan - 'Water Shows The Hidden Heart' - wich is also the name of the last track in 'Amarantine'. <br /> <br />And the great of all 'Sumiregusa' is sung in japanese! This time Enya didn't sung in gaelic! And I love her singing in gaelic! <br /> <br />And the other fabulous track, 'Drifting', only instrumental and it's not - this time - the first of the album. This one sounds like a good classic composition! Yes! Believe me! <br /> <br />The other tracks are good but not so good as the ones found in the other previous Enya cds! But enjoy! If you like Enya, please buy it! Anyway, it IS so hard for us to get a new cd by Enya so we just have to crab it when the chances came.
B0000931QA|5.0|Before this album, I had owned Dream Theater's Scenes from a Memory for a while. I loved, and still love that album. And I had heard great things about this album. Since I had loved SFAM, I decided to try this one out. And it turns out, I wasn't disappointed. At all. This album is beyond belief. Everything is perfect. Everything. Geoff Tate's voice hits the right notes, you can feel the emotion flowing through his words. The guitars are awesome. Everything just kills. This is the only Queensryche album I own, so I am a newbie Queensryche fan. But I can tell, this is the time in Queensryche's career where everything went right.  <br />Please, do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B000BP86OG|4.0|I was probably more excited about the release of this album than any others in 2005, except maybe one or two.  I could tell right away that the sound had changed and for the most part it seemed that production was the cause of this change.  Gone are the slicing and raw guitar tones of Permission to Land, and in its place is a very polished and at times overproduced album.  After my first listen, I felt slightly disappointed and let down.  However, after heavily repeated listens, I realized that every song on this album is just fun.  The songs are well written and well made.  Overall, I am pleasd with this album and I am definately looking forward to what The Darkness has in store for a follow up.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Ok, ok, I was told that my friends daughter wanted CINDERELLA for Christmas and thats what I was supposed to get for her, but I figured she would be much better for the experience if I got her THE GOONIES instead. I mean, she's almost five years old here... This movie is very important for kids to see. I'm pretty sure I was about that old when I saw it the first time. Plus I want to see Andie in that yellow sweater again. Ok, so maybe I bought GOONIES more for myself then her, but whatever. Which movie would YOU rather sit through countless times over and over? CINDERELLY? F*ck NO! I wanna see CHUNK do the god damned truffle shuffle! Do you wanna here those stupid rats singing stupid songs or would you rather be taken back with Cyndi Lauper? Singing stupid songs, of course... but I believe that we should have kids movies that we all can enjoy... I hate Disney, and so far I haven't dissapointed this girl yet. So , it's on, THE GOONIES!
6303379214|3.0|Given that I am quite easy on love stories, crazy about the Italian culture, and think highly of both Marisa T. and Robert D. as actors, this should have been an easy ride for me.  It certainly began with a premise I hold dear - - the notion that there is such a thing as \\"the one\\" and how we must overcome the forces that tell us to settle.  And so when Tomei's character is initially duped by Downey's character into believing he is the \\"damon bradley\\" she is seeking, I forgave his lie as an act of desperation by someone who has fallen hard in a split second.  However, for him to then subsequently set up a whole false scenario where he hires a friend to pretend to be the real \\"damon bradley\\" so he can appear generous and selfless in Tomei's eyes, was nothing short of cruel.  No one with a kind heart would do that to someone they truly love.  And I could never root for someone who had something like this in them. A romantic movie only works if you like both people and their flaws are forgivable -- as opposed to indicative of a willingness to manipulate, repeatedly lie, and consciously hurt someone to win them over to your side (this is especially true if the romantic movie is trying to sell itself as more drama and substance than just hapless comedy).    <br />PS I gave an extra star for the Italian scenery and beautiful hotels chosen for the film.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Thats right, it's that time of year again, the holidays. In order to keep up the spirit, I'm trying to think of all the best Holiday Fare I can come up with. Well, it just ain't Christmas in my family until we watch some NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION. My folks took me to see this in the theater back in '89, and its been tradition ever since. The movie is f'in hillarious, my mom will tell you that it's the best of the whole VACATION series, well if it isn't it certainly is a close two. Packed to the rim with hillarious one liners all around, this movie is always a blast. Hell, I even know a family that doesn't celebrate Christmas, and THEY watch this one every year. So... when you gots the whole family over this year and it's getting tough remember this movie.<br /><br />\\"We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F**KING Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assh*les this side of the nuthouse!\\"
B0000C8WYB|5.0|I love Mireille Mathieu, and I really like this collection. Although it includes a few songs that are not my personal favourites,I still cannot fault the disc, due to the other songs which more than make up for it. The love songs included in the selection are absolutely stunning.  The beauty of the melody, the depth of the lyrics, Mireille Mathieu's splendid voice and her beautiful French make for a lovely combination. <br /> <br />A few words about two of my personal favourites: \\"Mon Dieu\\" is a touching and passionate plea to God to let her hold on to her beloved a while longer. <br /> <br />\\"L'hymne a l'amour\\" is a wonderful and powerful declaration of love, in which the woman asserts that whatever happens, she doesn't care as long as her beloved loves her back. <br /> <br /> <br />Most of the other songs are very well known classics which I'm sure need no introduction (please note that I'm not very knowledgeable about Edith Piaf, so I apologize in advance to fans who know more about her songs than myself). <br /> <br />All I can say is that I love this disc, that I've played it loads of times and still keep playing it, and that you're really missing out by not acquiring it.  The songs are touchingly and passsionately performed, Mireille's voice is great, and you cannot fail to be emotionally affected, especially if you understand French.  If not,I believe Mireille Mathieu can really make you wish to learn the language.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007OCG56|5.0|Throughout the United States, Mexican seek not merely a better life (as many Americans would like to believe) but rather survival.  These immigrants are all faced with a simple yet difficult question:  How much should they assymilate, and how much of their own culture should they retain? <br /> <br />Flor (Paz Vega) is James L. Brooks' (director of As Good As it Gets) realistic portrayal of a Mexican woman, abandoned by her husband, seeking survival for herself and her daughter through emmigrating to the United States.  After six years of working two jobs in Los Angeles, Flor is forced to look for a single job to provide her with the money she needs and the time she needs to spend with her daughter.  She finds this job in the affluent Clasky home, as a housekeeper.  And this is where the cultures begin to clash in a very amusing, yet true to life manner.  And, it is here that Flor, and her young daughter, are faced with the question of identity.   <br /> <br />Sub-stories add depth and credibility to Spanglish.   The collapsing marriage of four star chef/restaurant owner John and neurotic recently unemployed Deborah Clasky (Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni), and the alcoholim of Deborah's mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) just skim the surface of the sub-plots in this film.  Deborah's constant stuggle for attention isolates her from her family, and her need for perfection drives her lonely, overweight daughter, Bernice, further away.  Bernice buckles at times under the pressure of unrealistic standards placed upon her by her mother, especially when Flor's seemingly perfect daugher, Cristina enters her life.  John, drained from his wife's persistant neediness, eventually turns to Flor for comfort.  <br /> <br />Throughout the entire movie, Flor's actions, and choices to refrain from action, are a direct result of her placing the needs of her daughter ahead of her own.  Even as the relationship between them is undermined by manipulative Deborah Clasky, Flor continues to liveher life for her daughter.   <br /> <br />This movie is a must-see.  Actually, it is not only a must see, but also a must see again.   <br /> <br />
B000C1YL1G|4.0|Okay I'm a big eminem fan.  I own all of his albums including his stuff before signed on with Interscope.  I also am a huge fan of his radio station, Shade 45 on Sirius.... <br /> <br />but the track, FACK is just a totally retarded song.  I heard it on Shade 45 the other day and couldn't believe that it was actually one of his songs.  I just think it doesn't sound good and is just purely retarded. <br /> <br />Anyway, besides that track...the rest on this cd are great.  This is an excellent collection of some of the best eminem songs.  <br /> <br />Overall....great cd and the bonus Stan's Mixtape is hot.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|This is not the same KoRn we remember.  After their last true album, Take a Look in the Mirror, which I happened to like but also which just was a retread of things before, I was wondering if KoRn would change their sound.  The resounding answer is yes.  KoRn's new cd is heavy but in a different way.      It is atmospheric and ambient, while at the same time holding onto KoRn's very groovable melodies.  It pulls in different genres of music, while at the same time being true to that KoRn sound.  The major influence, as far as I can tell, is industrial.  The 1 minute beginning to the cd and to Twisted Transistor is a perfect example of this, pulling in different sounds, experimenting, keeping you unbalanced until the opening guitars of Twisted Transistor pulls it together.  This continues throughout all 14 tracks; songs sometimes bleed into one another, all contain about the same feel which can either be a good thing or a bad thing.  Sometimes, groups that keep a similar sound throughout have a chance of becoming boring or repetitious.  In my opinion, KoRn treads this line, but every song is more of a hit than a miss.      While the cd is heavy in tone, I think fans will be divided.  Its not as raw as some of their earlier works.  You won't find songs like Blind or Daddy that have such raw emotion in them.  And, unfortunately, the bass guitar work, the sound oh so familiar to KoRn fans, that sounds like percussion at times is lessened.  There are a few songs that have it, but overall its not as standout as it once was which I'm a little disappointed in.      I'm not one to give ratings for each individual song.  I will point out a couple that are my favorites on the album.  Throw Me Away, Love Song and Coming Undone are my favorites because of the tone.  Part of the reason I love KoRn is their tone, the timbre of the music and these songs are the best for me.  Some of the middle songs do tend to be more midtempo and kind of slow the album down.  But I've had this cdfor a week (shh don't tell; I'm buying the album today) and even the middle songs which I didn't like in the beginning have grown on me.    This is the limited edition version.  What does that mean?  Well you get more songs, for one.  The two Twisted Transistor mixes (both \\"meh\\" but I don't usually like remixes) and two live videos, one of Twisted Transistor and one of Hypocrites.  Finally you get 3 \\"B Sides.\\"  I like the B Sides a ton, particularly Its Me Again which would have been a great opening track as Jonathan sings about how he sees things differently.  Its kind of tongue in cheek.  I also like Le Petit Mort which is the French saying for orgasm, giving an interesting turn to the name of the song Last Legal Drug.  You also get one year membership to the KoRn fanclub and a kick ass cd case.  Is it worth 20 bucks?  That's debatable.  But, if you can find it for cheaper (as there are sales right now) I would definitely recommend it.      In the end, I think fans will be divided on this cd.  Whenever a band \\"reinvents\\" themselves, the longtime fans (of which I'm one) tend to be upset.  And I will bet that you will find fans giving quite opposite reviews here shortly.  My recommendation is that if you enjoyed Twisted Transistor, you will probably enjoy this cd because the feel of that song continues through the rest of the cd.  I wouldn't go so far as to say See You On the Other Side is a KoRn reinvented, however it is easily their most different and unique album; its trying new types of music and its probably their most original and exciting and daring album since KoRn came on the scene with a little song called Blind.
B000002A46|5.0|This is a classic Christmas CD. While Mariah Carey did overdo some of it, she is the only one who can pull it off! Songs like \\"All I want for Christmas Is You\\" and \\"I Miss You (Most at Christmastime) became Christmas hits because of Ms. Carey's incredible voice. No one could sing O Holy Night quite like Mariah Carey, and the Gospel choir in the CD is great. This is hands down one of my favorite Christmas albums!

B00004Y7SF|2.0|This is a terrible album! Do not buy it. I LOVE Christina, I have all her CDs. But this is a mess. I was so mad the first time I heard this, she butchers every song on it. If you want to hear the classics done right, don't buy this CD. It may be her kind of Christmas, but It's definitely not mine!
0307276902|5.0|Oh I mean it. It really is the best book I have ever read in my life and I have read a lot of books. This book is more than a book about rehab. It is about survival, love, compassion, honesty, dignaty, inner strength, and determination. I absolutely LOVE this book and plan on reading it again, and maybe a third time. It touched me to the deepest core of my being. It's raw, and gut wrenching. It's beautiful and I love it. Read it if you can.
B000BVD460|5.0|This is a great compilation of all his good hits.  I'm not his biggest fan, but love all the songs I've already heard, and now they are all on one album.  Some songs will make you blush, but overall, the music is so good and catchy and this shows his amazing talent.  His songwriting is great whether you like rap or not.  Sing For The Moment, Lose Yourself and Mockingbird are my personall faves, but there really isn't a bad song on here.  No wonder he has won 9 Grammys.  I hope he's around for a lot longer.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|The is easily one of the best Madonna CDs, I have heard for a long time... ever since Ray of Light and Music.  Dance music has always been a large part of her talent, and it clearly shows here. Madonna produced most (if not all othe songs). Only a handful of them are written by her, but they are terrific.  \\"Jump\\" is my favorite, but I dig \\"I Love New York\\". Yeah, \\"Hung Up\\" is addictive, but really all of the songs are done so well.  This CD is a real jolt to a career that is almost as old as I am.  She has been around for so long, you forget the knack she has for just letting you listen...and dance.
0316286850|5.0|I doubt there will ever be someone as good as Kevyn.  He was one of a kind who worked magic.  Do you think Cher or Julia would trust their make up to just anyone?  The photos in here are brilliant and his talent shows through with each and every page.  You can learn some tricks by reading this, but even if you think you do a good enough job on your face yourself, this is worth buying if only to see some of his work.  A true talent that is really missed.
0380002930|5.0|I realize what one reviewer said was true, that WD is an allegory of the Iliad, but Adams makes this obvious, I think, with the quotations at the beginning of each chapter-a handy literature guide for us non-college going folks. <br />I find that Adams, like CS Lewis,skillfully uses collective myths (unlike Tolkien, who just copied them verbatim) to create this tale, then takes it a step further to explain why we need stories and legends in our own lives. As the rabbit Buckthorn says in Cowslip's warren, \\"El-ahrirah is a trickster, and rabbits will always need tricks.\\"   <br />This statement is proven time and again by the rabbits' adventures. It's a good read as a child, but as we get older, we recognize the characters and social mores of Cowslip's warren and Efrafa, and appreciate the lessons learned. If you are into anthropology and sociology you will probably especially enjoy it.
0395759242|4.0|Few better descriptions of rapacious colonialism, genocide, and vicious hypocrisy exist. The text provides a lucid account of a shameful chapter in human history. It should be read by all who think civilisation unblemished.
067144901X|5.0|When I first saw this book I wondered what all the \\"hoopla\\" was about. Then I read it to my 10 month old (then 8 months) and he loved it, and has loved it ever since. I have purchased many books for my son and this continues to be his favorite. I think because it's short, colorful and the rhymes are fun. I doubt it will disappoint.
B000AUDHW8|5.0|i was very surprised, and excited when this was released in europe.  i got mine from amazon.fr, and it was worth the money i paid for it (i seem to pay more for shipping than for the disc itself!).  yentl is barbra's first directorial feature and you can see the effort and detail that had been carefully shown in the movie.  the vhs has been out of print for many years and to have this movie, finally on dvd, is a blessing.  who knows when the director's version will be released in the us although i read that it has been completed.  in the mean time, do get this cd and enjoy the movie over and over again, it's still as fresh as it was, back when it was first released!
B000BJS4SU|2.0|I hate hearing how John Freaking Mayer is supposed to be so awesome. I downloaded some of the songs on this disc, and boy am I glad I didnt waste my money on this. Bored to tears was the best way to describe how i felt while listening.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I think the last time I heard a song come on and had to sit in my car until it was done was \\"Head Like a Hole\\" back in 1996.  Now I find myself rocking out in the parking lot before work, only to have the next song come on and start an all new adrenaline rush.  Listening to this album is like trying to eat just ONE potato chip.  You'll make yourself sick on it, but you'll love every bloody second. <br /> <br />I'm a 31 year old male weaned on the Beatles, punk, and 80's synth pop.  Imagine my surprise when the Darkness, a band I was on the fence about, comlpetely blew me away with this album.   <br /> <br />I disagree with the post above.  The Darkness have transcended their inspirations and become a rock-solid group in their own right.  These are the anthems of my mid-life crisis. <br /> <br />For those of you about to rock, I salute you.
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has the unique ability to get inside her subjects and make her subjects come alive. I thought she could never top her work on No Ordinary Time but with Team of Rivals I believe she has. <br /> <br />I've read quite a number of biographies on Lincoln. Some of them quite excellent. But I've never read any that showed the entire landscape of Lincoln's life more vividly and with more understanding then what she has done. Sometimes biographies seem like a bunch of facts strung together. By letting us get to know Seward, Chase, and Bates as she has allows for the reader to have a much greater understanding of the times and challenges Lincoln faced. It also allows for a greater understanding of how truly amazing a human being he was. <br /> <br />His life saw many dark times. He wasn't perfect. The forces that he had to deal with would have compromised most men or women. The pressures were that intense. But he was a brilliant man who had the unique ability to understand other human beings. He also had the unique ability to understand the political forces he was dealing with. But most of all he was a caring human being and it was his understanding of and compassion for people that made him the great person that he was. No book better brings this out then this one. <br /> <br />This book is unique. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Lincoln or just in the complexities that make human beings what they are. Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin for writing it.  <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I can't say that I'm a die-hard fan of SOAD, yet still I have all their albums and I do think that they are one of the best bands on modern rock scene. So, I wasn't even thinking about not getting Hypnotize and I can say I don't have even slghtest hint of regret. SOAD became wiser, more mature, yet they didn't lose their trademark craziness and irony. What pleased me personally is that on Hypnotize there is more Serj singing than Daron (like it was on Mesm). Don't get me wrong, I don't want to bash Daron for being crappy singer, he has relatively strong voice  - yet, it is rather... average and flat, especially in lyrical songs. Serj's voice is one of the things that make SOAD's sound recognizable and unique. Daron is brilliant songwriter and guitarist and he is excellent as \\"second voice\\", but I don't think it's a good idea to let him sing solo (for ex, I  think that if Serj was a leading voice in Lost In Hollywood, this song would be way better).   Attack - excellent intro - Daron's guitar is absolutely insane  Dreaming - one of my favorite songs on the album. Final harmonizing of Daron and Serj is a work of art  Kill Rock'n'Roll - funny and mindless. good song. when they sing it live, it sounds unbelievably powerful  Hypnotize - I think it's their happiest and most peaceful song so far. Beautiful and meditative, always makes me smile (and I sust admire the picture on a single :)).   Stealing Society - it's one of the songs where Daron's voice works just perfect, it gives  SS a good deal of irony  Tentative - one of the most tragic songs on the album, Serj's vocals is mesmerizing  U-Fig - excellent chorus and crazy Serj's screaming. One of my personal favorites  Holy Mountains - a masterpiece. It really reminds Aerials, but (though I love Aerials) it is more mature, more tragic and more sophisticated than Toxicity's final song. Simply brilliant  Viscinity of Obscenity - if HM is a tragic masterpiece, than VOO is a crazy masterpiece. be prepeared - it's extremely catchy:))  She's like heroin  - good, well-done funky song  Lonely Day - that's the very case, where Daron's solo is simply not working (it is especially clear in transitions between  Daron singing alone and him and Serj singing together) . Lyrics are rather wacky, but music is beautiful. I think it's the most non-soadish song.   Soldier's side - I love Holy Mountains more, but it's just a question of personal preference, because Soldier's side is one of those songs that make mindlessly chatting people shut up and listen. Haunting, beautiful and sincerely tragic
068987474X|5.0|This book is great in that it hits the nail right on the head over and over again, with examples of the many ways that men so often play along in a relationship with no intention of ultimately going the distance, i.e., marriage.  Before I finally  found someone I was really into and married her, I was guilty of treating women in ways that are discussed here.  Based on that and on observing friends and colleagues that are currently treating women this way, I commend this book to you if you are interested  in getting to the truth of the matter.  The presentation by the authors is quick paced and humorous.  But when these things are happening in relationships they aren't humorous at all.  The woman ends up wasting her time and being hurt, while the guy just slouches off and does the same thing to another woman that he is just not that into either.  The authors (even when using some contrived examples to make their points) provide excellent insight and offer sound advice that you deserve more.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album is without a doubt fantastic. Mayer has finally shown the world what I have always known about him. He's a fantastic guitarist. And with Pallandino and Jones to back him up he really lets loose what he can do. The solos are mindblowingly awesome. My personal favorite is the opening track, \\"Who do you think I was?\\". To me it just seems a poignant statement to what this album is all about. Get rid of all your preconceived notions of John Mayer, this boy has put on a new coat and he is very much comfortable in it. Watch this space all you guitar musos cause I think we may have found our newest hero to follow.
B00023BLXK|4.0|I loved the original dirty dancing and didn't think a sequal would be as good but I was pleasently surprised.  This movie actually has more story to it than the original and the dancing is even hotter.  If you love dancing movies you will love this.
0060763280|4.0|I typically will start with the lowest review for the book, and then read up.  What I found interesting is that typical complaints and bad reviews are similar, and will often times conflict.  This being said, I will go on here, explain my experience with the material, and expectations.  The main focus of this will be the weekend seminar, which is given away for free (and yes, laced with a sales pitches, which no one should complain about, because they are BRILLIANT sales pitches worth studying). <br /> <br />I managed to get ahold of the book from someone who gave me a copy of it.  I went to the evening, bought copies of the CDs of the Intensive, and other copies of the book (that came with it to give others, who took it and did nothing with it by the way).  I found the material interesting, and found Harv's focus to be different than others normally done that I am familar with. I recently also got back from the free weekend seminar. <br /> <br />What I can about Harv and his material is this: <br />1. He will try to upsell you (here is a hint: anytime a program is free, there will usually be upselling in it.  People do need to pay their bills and make a living).  If you don't like this, then don't go, don't buy the book, and don't do anything with your life.  It is your responsibility to say no.  And if you can't, then you won't get far in life.  It is your life, and your job to manage it.  Take what you can and leave the rest.  I found the weekend to be very well worthwhile.  Through the prior CDs I managed to get a budget/money management system (that I am still doing for months) in place, which I hadn't done.  This goes right into the next point. <br />1a. The book is one step in a process of a lot of other programs.  If you don't like this, then don't go.  There is no rule to say that you can't just do A or B and leave it at that.  And it is YOUR job to decide these things.  It is your life.  To max out your credit card in hope of some miracle, going to one ofthe seminars, ends up violating the principles of the money management system in the book, and expanded upon at the weekend seminar.  The weekend seminars at this point and time have gotten further away from the book as far as repeating it.  It still maps though.  It is more activity driven.  And it is your job to decide when you can do something, no matter how appealing. <br />1b. On the note of miracles, they say to expect miracles in your life if you implement this stuff (they don't say force, or put a timetable, just expect it).  Well, I was asked to make a committment to put into an investment fund account at the event, for when I got back.  I made a committment to a certain amount, and then when I got home, I had a check waiting for me that came in for over twice the amount. <br />2. Material doesn't work unless you work it.  You can go to a dozen of these programs, buy dozens of the books, but if you change, life won't change. <br />3. Harv's material isn't completely new.  If stuff works, why would you expect something different?  He adds his own spin and emphasis to material.  Harv uses a bunch of techniques from NLP, to RET, to anything else he can get his hands on that works. <br />4. The material does fit into the Bible and the teaching of Jesus.  Tweak a few things (his challenging \\"it is better to give than receive\\" is one).  It is your job to do this.  But, there is an abundance of other material there that is of benefit AND Biblical (this comment is in reference to the person or blasted Harv's material and saying \\"all you need is the Bible and trust in God\\"). <br /> <br />So, what can I say about the book.  Is it the best one ever?  No (book gets 4 stars here for that).  Will it by itself magically change your life?  No (you need to change for your life to change), but it is a start.  Will Harv try to upsell you like crazy?  Yes (but so what, you need to sell no and manage your life).  But, do I recommend the book?  YES.  And do I recommend taking upthe offer on the free weekend in the book?  YES (if you can manage to get to one of the locations). <br /> <br />Simply put, Harv has something that works, that makes him a lot of money, and helps a bunch of people.  It is worth studying this to see how it works (he is going to build a company that will work beyond him, because he is training and growing to have others do the presentations for the weekend).  To me, it makes a lot of sense.  In a nutshell, it is his job with this basic material, to get you working better as a person, so then you can do other programs. The weekend provides useful exercises for people to do there, and there are networking opportunities for a business you have.  And Harv puts his own mystical spin on this.  It ends up being entertaining, moving and life-changing. <br /> <br />All and all 4 stars for the book.  It is a solid effort, and worth checking out.  The free weekend seminar is the big bonus of it, just to simply go and see how he works, and taking lessons from that, plus networking for your business with people there. <br /> <br />A simple lesson in life here.  Be open to new things, and do NOT worship one program or another as THE TRUTH and the END ALL AND BE ALL.  People involved in Rich Dad do this (Kiyosaki has great material), and even with Harv Eker.  Throw out what doesn't work for you, keep what does, and be thankful for that which does.  But the basics of having a positive focus in life, doing a budget (money management system), and growing as a person don't harm anyone, and would fix a life.  Harv at least provides these things... and a lot more in my book (but you decide this or that on it).   <br /> <br />Myself, I am looking forward to dropping the bucks for future programs, when it is in my budget to do so.
0553573403|1.0|You call this thing a classic? I call it classic Junk.  God is this novel boring, slow, lengthy, archaic vocabulary, too many characters to keep track of, characters with names that are spelled so similar that it is easy to mix them up like: Aerys vs  Aenys, Viserys vs Visery, Ageon I vs Aegon II vs Aegon III, etc. I had trouble comprehending some parts of this novel because I mistakenly mixed characters up.  How can people say this novel is a real page turner? I found it a real page turner all right trying to skim through all these unnecessary pages to get to the main points of the novel was a challenge. This novel is about 300 pages too long. A lot of unnecessary writing in this book I think.<br /><br />Be forewarned this is not your typical fantasy book, infact I wouldn't call it a fantasy book at all ! When you read a fantasy book don't you want to read about dragons, spellcasting, perilous quests, heros and legends, far distant strange lands, special magical artifacts , time travel devices, demons and devils.  No not in this book. This book is a book of chivary and knighthood. A bunch of nights, lords, and kings thats it. Most of the reading is not about action or adventuring but rather character and plot building and subplots,  BORING ! You have to wait 400+ pages before this book starts getting good.  This is a King Authur genre. If you think this an origonal idea go watch 'nights of the round table' . Since when is 7 kingdoms an origonal ideas. Many fantasy novels seem to write things in 7's. The Seventh gate series, The Seven Sisters of Slaughter, Snow White and the Seven Dwaves, The Seven Hells, The movie 'SEVEN', etc.  This book is a murder mystery not a fantasy novel.  I didn't pick up this novel wanting to read a murder mystery. This novel isn't the usual tolkein cliche, thats why this novel is trash I enjoy reading the usual tolkein cliche its exciting! Its actually more entertaining then this TOME! Things actually happen in the Tolkein cliche, there is action, adventuring, questing, lore, etc.<br /><br />Gratutious sex sells ! This book has a lot of sex, not that I am offended by that, I like sex like most men, however this book in some parts reads more like porn than a novel. People say it gives the book realism, ya right they just like to read the porn thats why they give this book 5 stars. Steven King gets great reviews too because of his porn in his books, don't give me this realism farce. It cracks me up to read people say how careful this author is to carefully craft this story and have it nicely woven. Oh please! I suppose he carefully crafted the porn in this novel to fit in with the plot of the novel ?<br /><br />Other things I didn't like about the book:<br /><br /> 1) I found the idea of these nomad tribes in the mountains really stupid. Attilla the Hut genre. What does this have to do with the rest of the story, did he really have to put this trash in. There are some really stupid stories in here about these nomad people that reads more like a history book than a fantasy book.<br /><br />2) Vocabulary misused. I think the author used words in sentences that was not grammatically correct. If you look some of these words up in the dictionary it becomes apparent the author either a) confused the word with a different word, b) invented his own definition for a word.  For example the word: Holdfast.  The author uses this term for settlements or farms. However dictionary definiton of holdfast: 'that by which something is held securly in place'.  Another word: septa, sept, septam. The author uses this word for healers or clerics. However dictionary definiton of a sept: ' a division of a tribe ruled by a heredity cheif, especially in medieval Ireland '.  Unless this is a made up word, but I didn't see it in the index so I assumed it was a word that could be found in the dictionary.<br /><br />however I did like somethings about this book. I found the author very descriptive and enjoyed the lenghty descriptions of the characters and the castles and their squires and lords, etc. However this is all I liked about this book.descriptions of the characters and the castles and their squires and lords, etc. However this is all I liked about this book.
B000C8STLC|4.0|In an age of chart drivel and seemingly endless hip-hop and (yawn) R&B, it's good to see Enya back with a new album and this single release - which looked there for a minute as if it wouldn't come out at all (changing release date etc etc).  <br /> <br />Most Enya fans are familiar with the song \\"Amarantine\\"...but what of the extra tracks? \\"The comb of the winds\\" is your bog standard, typical Enya instrumental but it is all the better for it, similar to \\"The Promise\\" and \\"Oriel window\\" (from previous singles releases) - I like it very much. \\"The Spaghetti Western Theme From The Celts\\" i'm not too sure about. It must be from an advert or something - it's way too short for a start and doesn't seem to get going or have a purpose.  <br /> <br />Still, this is a welcome single release from someone who I have admired and followed for many a year. Most Enya fans will get this anyway for the extra tracks but I still recommend it for the un-converted...  <br /> <br />...after all, there's got to be more to music nowadays than Hip hop and screeching girl groups, hasn't there...?  <br /> <br />Regards.  <br />
B000AUDHW8|5.0|Yentl is a film that every Streisand fan should have seen by now. Strangely, it was released here in Europe a couple of weeks ago. The transfer is absolutely superb, the colours are brilliant, night scenes contain very little grain or none at  all. There are no features which I can overlook.     What I can't believe is that it is released on MONO!!! How can MGM (are they to blame?) overlook this essential ingredient in this Streisand musical? We do know that the reason why studio bosses at MGM gave the greenlight to Streisand to finally fulfill her dream is that she promised them that this would be a \\"film with music\\" (Barbra didn't want to call it a \\"musical\\" as she deemed it would demean the seriousness of this mild fable of a girl who disguises as boy to study the Talmud......everyone knows what happens next)     Going back, I don't understand why the men who are in charge in engineering the sound of this dvd release did not even bother to make it 5.1 or at least surround.     Streisand is talking about releasing a director's cut but when?? I read in the papers in 2003 that she was preparing to release Yentl on dvd with extras to celebrate its 20th anniversary. What has happened to that? Barbra Can You Hear Me????!!!...     It isn't unworthwhile to purchase this dvd. It is still dvd and as mentioned, the picture is absolutely gorgeous like watching a magnificent painting in motion. The sound is not a disaster but it could be much much better on 5.1!     The packaging is not also worthy of the film's status as a groundbreaker for a female artist and filmaker. It is in the league of other MGM haphazard releases without any extras but still are 5.1. Why?? \\"Tell me please why have a mind, if not to question whhhyyyy\\"     Anyhow, I do hope Barbra would get up from her years of slumber, in the arms of the man of her dreams and start wearing her different hats again. I still am waiting for that proper Yentl release.     Nothing is impossible!!!

That really helps out with \\"seeing\\" what Dan Brown is writing. It really, really fleshes out the story much better and is well worth the extra couple of bucks.<br /><br />Sean
B0002IU988|5.0|As a guitarist myself, Tremonti is how I would like to be in a few years, he's one of my favorite guitarists, and on this album he's even better than when he was with Creed, you can see how he owns more control now over their compositions and as you listen to it, you know how great and uncommon he is. <br /> <br />Their singer (kind of replacing Stapp), Myles Kennedy is absolutely awesome, his voice fits with the band and the kind of music they perform perfectly, in \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"In loving memory\\" which are both my favorite songs, his voice is exceptional. <br /> <br />Alter Bridge have creativity and so much potential which is a big lack with the new album of Scott Stapp which he is again talking through his lyrics about his nonsense religious' matters and personal problems, it gets boring and is not interesting at all, Stapp is lucky to have The Tea Party with him which they did a great job on the album or it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br />Go get Alter Bridge's debut album if you didn't yet... as I said, it's excellent! <br />Long life to Alter Bridge! <br />
031286504X|4.0|I greatly enjoyed the story \\"I Am Legend\\", but was quite dismayed to find that it ends halfway through the book and the remainder is short stories.  There's no indication on the listing that this is a book of short stories.
B000BVD460|4.0|1. Intro (Curtain Call)5/5:  This is definitly his best start to any of his Albums. It is funny. <br />2.  FACK 2/5: This song is probably the grossest song i have ever heard! It is definitly the grossest song Eminem has ever made.  Lyrics that make it this: <br /> Shove a gerbil in your a** <br />Do it too <br />Shove a gerbil in your a** <br />Do it too <br />Shove a gerbil in your a** <br />Do it too <br />Ewww <br />Eww ewww <br />3. The Way I Am 5/5:  One of his best tracks he has ever made. Em' vents much of his anger in this song.  Really pumps you up when you are mad. This song is from The Marshall Mathers LP <br />4. My Name Is 4/5:  This song is Em's first hit. Funny but slightly dumb. This song is from The Slim Shady LP <br />5. Stan 4/5:  Good song with nice content.  The lyrics aren't up to the standard usually seen on the Marshall Mathers LP (The CD this song was originally on). <br />6. Lose Yourself 5/5:  Possibly Eminem's greatest hit.  From the 8 Mile soundtrack. <br />7. Shake That 5/5:  Awsome song. One of my favorite on the CD.  It is about Eminem hooking a Sl*t up with Nate Dogg. <br />8. Sing For The Moment 5/5:  This song has excellent lyrics and a great Chorus by Arosmith.  This song is very deep.  (From my personal favorite Eminem CD, The Eminem Show)  <br />9. Without Me 5/5:  Funny song, telling a truth that the Industry would be empty without him.   <br />\\"But no matter how many fish in the sea <br />It'll be so empty, without me\\"  <br />This song is from \\"The Eminem Show\\" <br />10. Like Toy Soldiers 4/5:  Good Song with a great Chorus.  Sings about all the \\"beefs\\" in the rap game, and how it would be nice if it all stopped...(like that is ever gona happen).  This song is from Eminem's most recent to this album, Encore. <br />11.The Real Slim Shady 4/5:  Good song, singing that there will never be another Eminem or Slim Shady. Good lyrics. This song is from The Marshall Mathers LP. <br />12. Mockingbird 5/5:  Touching song to his daughter, apoligizing for the life he gave her. <br />13.  Guilty Concience 4/5:  Good beat.  Good rhymes by both Eminem and Dr. Dre.  Dr. Dre plays the good consience, Em' plays the demon on the other side of the \\"victim's\\" sholdiers. <br />14. Cleanin' Out My Closet 5/5:  This song could be a sequal to the song Kill You (Marshall Mathers LP).  In Kill You, Em sings about killing his mother.  In this song he is burying her in her grave. This song is from the Eminem Show. <br />15.  Just Lose It 5/5: Michael Jackson diss. Great lyrics. Funny. From Encore. <br />16. When I'm Gone 10/5: This song is my personal favorite Eminem song of all time.  He sings about being to busy for his family.  It is a VERY deep song. This is a NEW track. <br />17: Stan [Live with Elton John]:  The other version is better. <br /> <br /> <br />Personally I have every Eminem song (i think).  These are his hits, the songs that MOST people liked, and the songs that got played on the radio.  The hits aren't my personal favorites (My favorites after When I'm Gone are 'Till I Collapse (The Eminem Show), ans Square Dance (The Eminem Show).  But for most people the hits are they're fav's., so I highly recomend this album to you. <br />The albums most of theses songs came from are: <br />The Slim Shady LP (1999) 3/5 <br />The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) 5/5 <br />The Eminem Show (2002) 5/5 <br />Encore (2004) 4/5 <br />Curtain Call (2005) 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br />Good Luck
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Well, here is finally the latest album from the revolutionary nu-metal band... but wait, there is something different here! Yes there is, especially since Head is gone, there has been a lot of changes. First of all, you don't go listen to this album to throw you in a bit of melancholic mood anymore, unlike the previous albums. Yeah, it's a bit sad, but still, what we have got here ain't an easy piece of crap because of all the transformation. Korn still rocks the tunes with this album. At least, it heals all the wounds I have got after \\"Take a Look In the Mirror\\" which really sucked! This will be a short review, since other reviews tell a lot, so I just have to say this: \\"Beware, everyone. Korn is back in a different manner, in some ways better from the past, in some ways not. But do not skip this album!\\"
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is the greatest comic strip ever written. I would put Peanuts as a close second, but I will still put these two pals at the top of the list. It's wonderful to see all of their adventures gathered into one collection. I do wish, however, they would offer a CD version of this set so that I could see Watterson's beautiful drawings using the brilliance of my color monitor & maybe one day they will.<br /><br />I've never really forgiven Bill Watterson for taking these two characters away from us (or, at least, not letting their adventures continue) and I have always thought that there were compromises available that would have left him with his creative dignity and still satisfied the publishing machine. For example, why not let people subscribe to a once-a-week online version? The colors on a good monitor are better than anything in print and the Internet is the new newspaper.<br /><br />But alas, it will probably never happen. Calvin and Hobbes have left the buidling :) But if I had to go to a desert island (or rather, if I was lucky enough to go to a desert island!) and could take only one set of books, this would, without question, be the set I would take. I agree with another reviewer that the pages should have been sewn and more care should have been taken with the archival nature of the books, but still, I'm grateful for what they have created.<br /><br />It still amazes me that Charles Schulz died on the day that his last Peanuts strip was published. I had always hoped Watterson would make a life career with these two characters. But I suppose it's not fair to blame him for walking away:  the idiot newspaper publishers in this country killed the Sunday comics forever with their tiny reproductions and horrible colors.<br /><br />Tragically, Calvin and Hobbes got caught in the crossfire.<br /><br />Jeff Wignall<br />Author, The Joy of Digital Photography<br />Devout Calvinist.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|***Update***  January 2012  Wow. I wrote this review right after I turned 18 years old. I will always be a Final Fantasy VII fan. This movie was a great addition to the Final Fantasy series in my opinion. I apologize for my childishness of my original posting. I enjoyed this movie and I hope you all will too.  ***Original Post from Dec 2005***  Ok I am a huge FF7 fan. I love FF7 more than any other game that i have played. I thought this movie was great. I have been waiting for over 2 years for this game. I found out about it through a mistake while i was looking for some FF7 online. Ever since then i have been waiting through all kinds of issues. Release days which turned out to be changed constantly. Finally someone downloaded it from the internet for me because they wanted me to be happy. lol and it was great. I didnt like the other FF movie but this one seems to be one of the best movies i have ever seen. And by the way Tifa doesnt die... stupid people. The movie rocked and ill be buying it as soon as it is released.  FF7 Fan For Life  Aubrey
B0000042H4|5.0|Ever since the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1951, the operatic world has been blessed with many Ring recordings that are brimming with life and searing in interpretation.  The work is certainly the most ambitious and fascinating musical epic ever set on paper, and due to its intricate music and magnificent and poetic text, it has influenced the way music making has been done ever since the Master presented it to the world in 1876.  Now, 130 years after that first Ring cycle, the market abounds with hordes of Ring recordings raging from magnificent to deplorable, and with the cost of having to contain such a grand epic in recordable media for the listener to enjoy at home, the pricetags for these Rings are always going to be astounding.   <br /> <br />A Ring cycle in the recording studio, of course, is no longer a foreseeable possibility today.  The recent Tristan by EMI alone took a good month in the recoring studio, and with the increasingly high wages in the musician's union and the expensive fees needed to pay competent and artistic Wagnerian singers, another Ring in the studio would probably be a Herculean task at best.  And, to add to that, the world is sorely lackiing of hochdramatische sopranos, true heldentenors, and great bass-baritones to sing the parts of the cycle's most difficult roles--Brunnhilde, Siegfried, and Wotan.  The dearth of these species of voices, plus the scarcity of conductors who can masterfully lead an orchestra into playing one of the most complicated scores ever written in the true Wagnerian style, makes these matters more complicated.  In my opinion, only Christian Thielemann can possibly execute this vision effectively today.  Due to this, in order to be able to experience this monumental opus, you must turn to the recordings of the past to sample the greatness of Richard Wagner. <br /> <br />I personally feel that the greatest Rings come from the postwar Wieland Wagner Bayreuth festivals.  Under his leadership, a calibre ofWagner singing was formed and has been unmatched ever since his premature death from lung cancer.  With a team that consisted of chorus master Wilhelm Pitz, singers Astrid Varnay, Hans Hotter, Wolfgang Windgassen, Ramon Vinay, Gustav Neidlinger, Gre Brouwenstijn, Martha Modl, and later Birgit Nilsson, Martti Talvela, James King, Leonie Rysanek, and other singers who owned these roles in the Theatre on the Green Hill, plus a plethora of conductors that consisted of Herbert von Karajan, Hans Knappertsbusch, Clemens Krauss, Joseph Keilberth, and Rudolf Kempe (all conductors who by some divine intervention all had last names beginning with \\"K\\"), Wieland Wagner unveiled a new and fresh way of Wagner interpretation along with a team of singers and musicians who made this great music sing. <br /> <br />Some people though, would much prefer the music in the undisturbed, almost pristine conditions achieved by the recording studio.  While there are several Der Ring des Nibelungen that have come out of recording halls following this one, none of them have matched it in popularity.  And there is a reason for that of course.  Solti leads the Wiener Philharmoniker in a recording that brings the theatrical values of Wagner's operas to the comfort of the living room without the stage noises and other distractions that some listeners seem to detest.  In addition to that, the care put into immortalizing this Ring in recording media has made it one of the most \\"real\\"-sounding performances on disc.  Here, you get the steerhorns and tuned anvils and metal bars that Wagner personally requested to be put into the score, in addition to other sound effects that would be impossible to realize in the theater.  You can hear the violent thunder in the opening of Act III of Siegfried and the closing scene of Rheingold.  I could go on about all these little details, but I leave that for you to witness yourself.   <br /> <br />That said about its realistic audio qualities, I would like to discussthe merits of Solti's conducting.  It is true that while Solti had a heavy hand in this recording in comparison with conductors such as Karajan, Krauss, Bohm, and Boulez who exuded transparency in their readings, he brings everything in the score to life.  He understands Wagner's score well, and his reading is closer to Knappertsbusch on a good day, a method that harkens the traditional way of conducting Wagner.  He also has good judgment as to where tempi changes must be made, as can be heard from the closing scene of Das Rheingold.  The orchestration during Donner's \\"Heda Hedo!\\" is simply ravishing, and the tempi that Solti uses and adjusts to sounds dramatically right.  Wagner himself would have been proud.  His understanding of the more complex and post-Tristan scores of Siegfried and Gotterdammerung are still unparalleled today.  From the Mime Wanderer riddle scene to the Forging song to the Wotan Erda confrontation and the glorious love duet that ends the opera, Solti gets all the orchestral nuances perfectly.  His Siegfried is so alive, that any recording after that can be considered below par.  But if there was ever one recording that deserved the praise this Ring receives, it has to be Solti's Gotterdammerung.  From the haziness of the Norn scene to the Dawn love duet and the Gibichung hall music, and the Waltraute Brunnhilde dialogue, I think Solti captures this Act perfectly.  Act 2 is done well too, with Gottlob Frick's menacing Hagen and Neidlinger's definitive Alberich creating a most sinister mood accompanied by Solti's masterly conducting.  The revenge trio that caps the act is perfectly executed by the Vienna Philharmonic, and I think that if it were not for the presence of Knappertsbusch's recent Testament release with Varnay and Uhde, this would also probably be the best Act II on disc.  Then we have Act III, the culmination of the Ring cycle.  From the chattering of the Rhinemaidens to Siegfried's death and funeral march to the glorious Immolation Scene, I think this Act III represents Wagner's music at its greatest, and no other recording captures the essence of the final moments of the Ring with all its synthesis of the various leitmotifs in such a moving manner.  This is, perhaps, the best conducted Ring of the studios, and on a good day, I would feel exceeds that of the Bayreuth rings.  (Hey! I have my Wagner whims too, and on some days, I if tend to have a preference for Krauss, Karajan, Knappertsbusch, or Bohm...that is my preference!  Chacun a son gout!) <br /> <br />Now for the cast.  I have never seen such a glorious cast assembled in the recording studio such as this, and everything from Neidlinger's Alberich, Nilsson's Brunnhilde, Hotter and London's Wotans, Windgassens's Siegfried, Flagstad's Rheingold Fricka and Ludwig's Walkure Fricka, Hoffgen's Erda, King's Siegmund, Crespin's Sieglinde, Frick's Hagen and Hunding, Bohme's characterful Fafner, Sutherland woodbird, Stolze's Mime, and the chattery and lusty Walkures, Norns, and Rheinmaidens is simply a vocal treat.  That said, these individual singers' solo performances can be heard to greater advantages elsewhere, but nowhere are they captured better vocally than here.  Of course, some singers such as Hotter are no longer in their prime, but what a magnificent performance he gives!  His Wotan is so grand and noble that I think that the only Wotan who beats him is his younger self.  Nilsson's Brunnhilde is a force of nature.  Her missile-like voice is fascinating, encompassing Brunnhilde's vocal music with such ease that one would think Brunnhilde was a walk in the park.  She is hands-down one of the greatest Brunnhildes ever, along with Astrid Varnay and Martha Modl.  Siegfried here is sung by Windgassen, the tenor who single-handedly solved Bayreuth's heldentenor shortage for more than a decade.  His voice, of course, has aged, but he is such an intelligent artist that one cannot help but listen to his Siegfried artistically portrayed withoutany vocal problems that today's many Siegfrieds encounter.  James King is a most moving Siegmund, surpassed only by his Bohm interpretation and possibly Ramon Vinay on a good day, and his Sieglinde, Regine Crespin, is one of the most female and human singers ever to have brought the role to life.  Christa Ludwig is the most sumptuous Fricka and Waltraute on disc, combining her great vocal beauty with her consummate artistry.  Her singing here is nothing short of definitive.  The Walkures are all great, the cast including two future Brunnhildes: Helga Dernesch and Berit Lindholm.  The supporting cast of giants is also very good, with Kurt Bohme as a most characterful Fafner.  I think that the Fasolt could have been sung better though.  The Norns also consist of some of the most famous singers of the Wagnerian oeuvre, some of them taking the great roles in the years to come.  Hoffgen sings Erda magnificently.  My only quibble here is the casting choices used for Rheingold's Rheintochters.  They sound a bit old.  They characterize their characters playfully, but one could wish that Solti had used the maidens singing for Karajan or Bohm's recording.  Otherwise, the cast is almost flawless. <br /> <br />Must this be your first Ring?  With the care lavished on such a great project (Culshaw's attention to the miniscule details in the score), Solti's wonderful conducting, and a cast that truly represents the golden age of Wagner, I would say, this is an essential recording for anyone's collection.  It is possibly the greatest achievement in the recording studio, and in many ways, the greatest recording of the century.
B000B8QF14|5.0|I was so excited to get Bullet in a Bible.  I was waiting for it to come out.  As soon as I bought it, I hurried home to watch it.  I have to say...WOW!!!  On a big screen with the volume on high it seems like if you are almost at one of their concerts.  I took the CD to work and heard it over and over.  Obviously, it's not the same as the regular CDs, but, again, I felt as though I was in the concert.  I got butterflies in my stomach.  There is no one better than Green Day!!!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I've been a Madonna fan since the age of 1.  Yes.  1.  I was 1 when I first saw Desperately Seeking Susan. <br /> <br />She has been my inspiration for the next 21 years of my life... and I feel always will be.  Over my lifespan I've collected all of her full-length albums and a few singles... I try not to get too carried away with the rarities though.  That's expensive stuff!  Regretfully I don't even own the \\"Sex\\" book!  I would listen to her stuff every single day (until I reached puberty at least and found other magnificent artists as well)... imagine that... times 12 or 13 years... that's a lot of Madonna knowledge! <br /> <br />So it's safe for me to assume... that... hey!  I know what I'm talking about.  I love this album.  Not only does the music rock, but there are so many similarties to her older stuff.  Want examples? <br /> <br />-\\"Time goes by so slowly for those who wait... <br />Those who run seem to have all the fun...\\" <br />LOVE SONG (Like A Prayer, 1988) <br /> <br />-Forbidden Love... one of my absolute favorite tracks on Bedtime Stories (1994).  The title has been re-used for the purposes of this new album.  I was a bit confused at first when I saw the track listing on the back of the CD... I thought to myself... \\"She's re-doing her own song?\\" but... nope... It's a whole other song.  They're incomparable, though... almost like comparing two different worlds. <br /> <br />-I can't say that any music riffs were taken directly from her older material... but I CAN tell you that I think the groovy bass line from \\"Jump\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Physical Attraction\\" (Madonna, 1983) and of course, the opening strings of \\"Let it Will Be\\" are reminiscent of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (True Blue, 1986). <br /> <br />-\\"The only thing you can depend on is your family\\" - JUMP <br />That line is extremely reminiscent of \\"Keep it Together\\" (Like a Prayer, 1988). <br /> <br />There are other references perhaps, but I haven't heard them yet. <br /> <br />Madonna is extremely brilliant.  She always has been.  I don't care what you say, she would not be where she is today if she wasn't a freaking genius (in any sense of the word you wish to interpret).  She purposely used cheesy lines on \\"I Love New York\\", people.  It's on purpose.  She purposely put in all of these little subtle references to her older material as well as other artists.  Only the best artists are able to incorporate messages that aren't always evident at first listen.  The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it.  And that's how I like my Madonna.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|...but man, is it good.<br /><br />I think the other million reviews of this film are good enough to cover the main plot points, so I'll leave that alone.<br /><br />What really, REALLY impressed about this film is the way it \\"captures thoughts\\".<br /><br />Anyone that has been in a great relationship (or several) that just sort of ran its course, \\"puttered-out\\", and turned awful can identify with this movie on a personal level that is almost painful. The effect is almost therapeutic to the viewer, it's that dead-on.<br /><br />When Carrey's character is reliving the good times that came before the end of his relationship with Clementine, the scenes have a surreal, \\"viewing from a distance\\" glow that very closely mimic those thoughts that crop up in your head when you remember lost love. Hits you like a sledgehammer, at least it did me.<br /><br />This film really addresses all of the twenty-and-thirty-somethings out there that really didn't fall into \\"the mold\\" of getting married and having kids right out of school. I think you need to be a little older to really appreciate it.

THE REST ARE SOMEONE ELSES SONGS THAT HE JUST REUSES THE SAME OLD GUITAR FILLS IVE BEEN HEARING FOR THE PAST THREE CDS. I'M A GUITARIST, AND I KNOW THAT CRAP HE PLAYED IN THE BACKROUND OF \\"HIS\\" CD WAS ABOUT AS UNCREATIVE AS IT GETS. I MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO CARLOS, GIVEN I GREW UP PLAYING AND LISTENING TO HIS MUSIC, WHICH IS WHY I AM SO UPSET WITH ALL THAT I AM BECAUSE I KNOW HE IS SO MUCH BETTER! <br />  IVE HEARD ALL OF SANTANAS OTHER STUFF WHICH IS SO MUCH BETTER AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M OLD, I'M ONLY 20.

I JUST WONT TELL ANYONE THAT I DID.  <br />  NOW I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS NEW ALBUM FOR ABOUT ALMOST AN ENTIRE YEAR, SERIOUSLY. I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN HOW DISSAPOINTED I WAS WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH THIS POP AND RAP CD. TAKE IT FROM ME, IF YOU ARE A SANTANA FAN DO NOT BUY THIS CD. I'M SORRY BUT I HOPE THE NEXT SANTANA CD FEATURES THE SANTANA BAND, CAUSE THIS TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS SANTANA LIKE THE COVER SAID. TURNS OUT IT WAS A POP CD.
630512762X|5.0|One word can classify this movie: EXTREME. <br />Face Off has trully a very original plot to start off with and builds off of that with nonstop action and gorgeous visual effects. This movie reminded me of Die Hard, because these two movies are REAL action movies. Face Off might even be considered as being superior to Die Hard.  <br />The movie is about a battle between two men. The good guy, Sean Archer (John Travolta) and the bad guy who killed Archer's son, Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage). When Troy is finally captured, there is a warning that there is a bomb somewhere in the city. But Troy is in a coma and his brother won't talk. Archer then decides to \\"become\\" Troy by taking his face in a very well made scene (surgery). But this \\"simple\\" procedure goes wrong and when Troy wakes up, he's mad. And he decides to take Archer's face. So they \\"become\\" two people. The only problem is that every thinks that they are the person they appear to be. So while Archer has become Troy and is in prison, brutalized..Troy is Archer...an FBI hero who's living the real Archer's life..living with his wife and daughter. <br />The movie is explosive and packs TONS of action. The body count is definitely triple digits and this is one hell of a good movie. It also packs some emotional moments and a good, sweet conclusion.  <br />John Travolta steals the show! This is his best performance! He is the perfect vilain. He's trully great fun and is so evil!  <br /> <br />The movie is a must see and its original plot and two lead actors let alone should draw you in.  <br />Face Off is a must see, a brilliant piece of filmaking, one of the few blockbusters that is actually worthy of its tons of money making.  <br />The thrills are constant, and just when you sit down to breathe for a while, guess what? MORE ACTION!  <br />Face Off is John Woo's landmark American movie, a must see that is worth owning as it will deliver many viewings. It is a landmark action movie and its concept makes it a landmarksci-fi movie. It's one of the best action movies that I've ever seen and will delive for one hell of a good time.

6305252572|5.0|Believe it or not, the first time that I saw this movie was a couple days ago. I had some pretty high expectations and well, it blew them away! Comparable to such classics as Beverly Hills Cop, I consider this movie to be better than it. Wow! That's something to say! <br />48 hrs is trully hilarious, a must see with plenty of action and nonstop laughs.  <br />Jack (Nick Nolte) is the bad cop. He's not a bad cop in the sense that he's a vilain but he's big, rough and mean. So when he has to team up with a con, Reggie (Eddie Murphy) to nail two murderers, things go wild.  <br />From then on, everything is hilarious! Eddie Murphy delivers the majority of them. Look for the hick scene that will deliver laugh after laugh.  <br />James Remar and Sonny Landham are great vilains and add to the fun. So, if you want to have some great fun, watch the classic buddy cop movie! <br />And, I trully find it to be better than Beverly Hills Cop. On top of it, this wad made 6 or 7 years before it!  <br />48 hrs is great fun and is something worth owning and watching over and over again. But as a DVD, it's not too fancy and not very well made. But, you can buy it cheap and eventually when they re-release it, you'll be able to get the new one.  <br />
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink-182. A perfect example of 3 guys who never grew up. but that isn't nessicarily a bad thing. They're suprisingly talented, and this album is a perfect example of blink at its best.    Okay, Blink's songs can be repetative. We've established that. but that's part of their appeal. Every single song on this CD is extremely catchy (with the exception of Adam's Song, but hey, that adds a little variety),and the lyrics are well thought-out and chock full of profanitites. (In this case that's a good thing.) The guitar may not be AMAZING, but   DeLonge can do a lot with 3 chords. Travis probably has the most talent out of anyone in the band, and it shows on \\"The Anthem\\" and \\"Dumpweed.\\"    Best Songs: All The Small Things, What's My Age Again?, Dumpweed, Dystenary Gary (I probably spelled that wrong,but oh well.)    The only songs on the CD that get a little old after a while are Don't Leave Me  and Wendy Clear, but they're excusable. Of course, I have no complaints about The Party Song, a sort of rap-style song with fast guitar and even faster lyrics.    A great CD if you like upbeat, entertaining, catchy songs, or are just looking for a good laugh.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Why does everyone gotta be hating on Mariah.  So what the girl gained a few pounds and decided to release her album again.  She's the one making the money so she can do want ever she pleases.  She has fans that are going to support her through thick and thin.  She made a comeback and it was an amazing comeback.  All her singles have gone number one and thats because the girl can sing.  It's not because she's thin, not because she's fat, or because she thinks she's hot, but because she can sing.  It don't matter wnat she does, she's Mariah Carey so get over it. So everyone needs to quit dissing her and get over the fact that she's famous and has dedicated fans that will stand beside.  Your stupid comments aren't gonna make her not release an album.  So stop being so jealous and upset and just realize that Mariah is a true Diva.
0060872675|5.0|I got this as a joke gift for my daughter, who also loves Pratchett.  The pictures are great, especially the last one (and there's Terry on the wall, too.)  I like the story, as well, because I'm familiar with the characters.  Commander Vimes is a perfect father. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if children would actually enjoy this book... it might be confusing.  On the other hand, if their daddy is reading it to them, it's all good.  The librarian gives it an OOK! and I agree.
0553801503|4.0|If you enjoyed the other books in A Song of Ice and Fire, you most likely will enjoy Martin's latest too, despite all the bellyaching. Like everyone else, I have gripes, and I'll get them out of the way. First, by expanding the scope to include Braavos, Dorne, and the Ironborn, Martin is turning a five-parter into a ten-parter, and we all know what happened to Robert Jordan when he decided that quantity was more important than quality. Second, leaving Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion out of this installment is a mistake, since, in my opinion, they are the most significant \\"heroes\\". At least one of them should have been appeared in this one; no one would have cried if Samwell was postponed until the next one. Third, too much regalling of lineages and background. We don't need to know everyone's family tree. Fourth, adding Arys, Arianne, Asha, Victarion, and Damphair as viewpoint characters is a result of poor structure. Do we really need three different POVs from the Ironborn? One is enough. And why include Arys at all considering how his storyline ends? That chapter could easily have been told from Arianne's POV. Too many characters. Someone should tell Martin that he doesn't have to replace the characters that he kills off.   <br /> <br />Despite my complaints, I enjoyed A Feast for Crows and read it in a matter of hours. Adding Cersei was a nice touch because it's always fun to experience events from a villain's POV. I only hope that she stays a villain and doesn't become a victim. The strength of the series is the characterization, and character growth is not spared: Samwell, Arya, Sansa, and Jaimie all undergo dramatic changes. Unlike other readers, I'm a fan of Brienne. She's a realistic, original character, and I like how she witness the effects of the war on the lowborn. Most of the story focuses on the nobles, scions, and knights, and it is refreshing to read about the smallfolk. Her chapters read like a travelogue as she ventures from place to place and discovershow the game of thrones has ruined villages. <br /> <br />I await Book 5, even if it takes another five years to compose. Two hopes: the Hound lives and more Blackfish!
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Below the sugar-coated surface, this is a deeply disturbing and profoundly bad movie.  What does this movie define as love?  Certainly not marriage, nor even commitment.  Of the marriages portrayed in the film, most contain adultery, lies, and misery (or death).  The relationships which are featured, and which, presumably, we're meant to think of as \\"love,\\" are infatuations, crushes, and lusts.  Despite the movie's reputation as a \\"chick flick,\\" one might note that several of the relationships involve powerful men falling for their vulnerable employees, hardly a model of 21st century feminism.  This movie contributes to the unhealthy and pervasive notion that love happens instantly, requires no communication (in one case, a couple falls in \\"love\\" without ever even speaking), and trumps all other considerations (for example, we're meant to sympathize with the lout who tries to seduce his best friend's wife).  The movie has no shame, either, alternating scenes meant to \\"realistically\\" portray how real people live and love with scenes so ludicrous as to defy belief (example: the sexually naive porn star?  the shy politician?  the American girls who sleep together naked?).  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on this rubbish...
B0000025L0|5.0|Let me clear the line-up first:<br /><br />Personnel includes: Stanley Clarke (vocals, piano, acoustic, electric & piccolo basses, handbells, gong, chimes); Jack Nimitz, Buddy Childers, Lew McCreary, George Bohanon, William Peterson, Stuart Blumberg, Albert Aarons (brass); David Sancious (organ, keyboards, Mini-Moog synthesizer, guitar); George Duke (keyboards); Billy Cobham (Moog synthesizer, drums); Icarus Johnson (acoustic & electric guitars); John McLaughlin (acoustic guitar); Raymond Gomez (guitar) Gerry Brown (drums, handbells); Steve Gadd (drums); Milt Holland (congas, triangle, percussion).<br /><br />All the geniuses are together to show the best of their funk jazz effort. Stanley Clarke was always the best in bass rhythm no matter he is solo or with jean luc ponty. He can mix with any situation and creates something anew.

B000301YY8|5.0|I'm pretty sparce on writing reviews and tend to write on albums that stick out (good or bad). Being a lover of British rock music most of my life, I saw this album was at the top of major British charts back in June and July and finally got a copy of the album.  I was not only glad to have found this album but absolutely taken aback with how amazing the album is. <br /> <br />There is not one song on this entire album that I can skip over, something that I can say about maybe 5 other albums I own (out of about 3,000).  The ballad nature of this album is a fresh approach but the depth of the lyrics makes this album truly shine.  \\"High\\" starts out the album with a dreamy like feeling from the light piano and acoustic guitar...not to mention very captivating lyrics. \\"You're Beautiful\\", the lead off single, is truly heart-wrenching and romantic at the same time.  Not to mention we get Mr. Blunt's range and the lyrics are so that anyone can relate to them. \\"Wiseman\\" is probably one of the most unique songs musically that I have heard in quite a long time and I can't help but listen to it over and over. <br /> <br />\\"Goodbye My Lover\\" has been and will always be my favorite song on this entire album. It is probably the most melancholy songs on the album but it's also the most passionate.  The piano overlay and echo gives the feeling of loneliness and reflection.  It's easy to see how this song can chronicle a relationship but also how this song could easily translate over to Mr. Blunt's time in Kosovo and reflecting on what he gathered from that assignment.  The violin addition on this song just makes it even more complex and passionate. <br /> <br />\\"Tears and the Rain\\" follows in a similar melancholy/reflective vein but the acoustic guitar and lyrics of this song are a perfect transition.  The lyrics in this song really do create beautiful images, including the reference to Dorian Gray's plague to be alone and stuck forever in the same place like Mr. Blunt must have seen himself when he wrote this song. \\"Out of My Mind\\" begins very differently with a semi-industrial feel on the opening but is a song that seems one where there is a reflection on what is real and what is important. \\"So Long, Jimmy\\" reminds me slightly of Elton John circa 1973 and the lyrics and spirit of the music is a great dedication to \\"Jimmy\\".  \\"Billy\\" takes the same more upbeat spirited approach with good lyrics. \\"Cry\\" definately has political underpinnings and must be reflective of Mr. Blunt's experiences on assignments.  It also reflects on the horrific side of war and actually is probably one of the few songs that goes after war itself being horrible instead of politicians, making it a much more poignant song.  \\"No Bravery\\" takes up where \\"Cry\\" ends and describes the desolation of war and its effects on everyone involved.  This song is probably the single most heart-wrenching song about war that has ever been done and really paints pictures of war in words, images that we won't ever see on the news or anywhere else. <br /> <br />\\"Back to Bedlam\\" really is a collection of amazing songs, musically and especially lyrically.  Even if you are a pro-war person or pacifist, this album can appeal to you and really make you think.  This is the best album of 2005 and quite possibly the beginning of a legend in Mr. Blunt.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|The Good<br /><br />Rapid-fire drum beats and lighting quick guitar riffage come at you with unstoppable force on \\"The Great Dividers\\". Trevor Phipps is a blood-curling madman on the microphone as he spews about the ravages of world conquest. The guitar work is even faster and sharper on \\"Failure\\". It's nice to know there are still bands that offer scathing twin guitar attacks. Drummer Mike Justin does a great job with the emotional changes of the song; from frantic to subdued.

B00000HYXB|5.0|A concept album based on J.R.R. Tolkein's \\"The Silmarillion\\", Blind Guardian's \\"Nightfall In Middle-Earth\\" is epic metal at its best, technical yet instantly captivating and combining all the best elements from symphonic music, speed metal, folk-inspired metal, etc. to create a masterpiece.  Told with interludes between the songs consisting of spoken word, sounds of wind and water and such, the roar of mighty battles, and the calls of birds, breaking the album up with such short pieces between songs could have turned out campy and a distraction but comes out perfectly instead, greatly enhancing the whole album.  In addition to the always excellent lead vocals, the enormous choruses, the flawless guitars and bass, the masterful and innovative drums and the classy keyboards, \\"Nightfall\\" benefits greatly from brilliant grand piano performances by Michael Schuren and excellent work on the flute and alto-flute by Max Zelzner.  Standout songs include the incredibly bombastic \\"Into The Storm\\", the slower and regal \\"Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)\\", \\"Mirror Mirror\\" - a candidate for best speed metal track ever, incorporating a celtic feel into itself - the great midtempo \\"Nightfall\\" and the epic \\"Time Stands Still At The Iron Hill\\", which effortlesly conjures up stunning visual imagery of vast opposing armies atop exotic beasts in a beautiful land about to be marred by a desperate stand against the forces of evil.  Actually though, pretty much everything could be singled out as a highlight track; it's simply among the greatest albums ever recorded.
B000803PKY|4.0|The Good<br /><br />\\"Running on Empty\\" is the most familiar song on the album, and it sounds so much better with its heightened clarity and 5.1 mix. Jackson expressed how his journeys are wearing down on him. \\"The Road\\" takes you deeper into depression and despair with acoustic guitars and emotional lyrics. The piano heavy track \\"Rosie\\" delves into the trials and tribulations of the `groupie' culture. It's no surprise that drugs were a big part of the music industry at the time (did I just say were?). Browne approaches the subject with a little bit of humor and a little bit of sadness on \\"Cocaine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Needs a Heart\\" is a touching power ballad where Browne puts his heart out on his sleeve. \\"Nothing But Time\\" has a funky rhythm and bluesy vocals that convey all that can happen when you have nothing to do until the next show. \\"Stay\\" wraps the whole saga up with a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. Whereas most of the album focused on the negative aspects of the road, this one focuses on the great things and people you deal with along the way. The bonus tracks are included only on the DVD mix of the album. \\"Cocaine Again\\" is okay, but not really interesting, and \\"Edwardsville Room 124\\" is a mellow instrumental.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The rest of the DVD material (montages, photos, lyrics) are cool to have, but you'll probably only view them once.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I never really listened to what Running On Empty was all about until now. Apparently I missed a lot just listening to it casually. The album is a well-written, informative, intelligent, and sometimes sad account of life on the road. It's an album that can hold it's own no matter what decade your talking about. I can honestly say that Running On Empty is a timeless piece of artistry that should not be missed. The 5.1 mix is excellent.
0553801503|2.0|Plenty of others have said it, and I'll repeat it:  this book was filler material.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) There are two points of view(POVs) that are given one chapter each, both taking place in Dorne.  They should have been replaced with 2 extra chapters of a third POV that ALSO takes place in Dorne. It's very un-Martinlike to give us such a shallow picture of a POV character.<br /><br />2) The Brienne chapters are boring and pointless.  Even the \\"cliffhanger\\" moment isn't that surprising to anyone who read the last page of A Storm Of Swords<br /><br />3) The Samwell chapters have no redeeming qualities to them until the end of his LAST chapter.<br /><br />4) the Jaime chapters, while interesting, will literally repeat the same sentence (words that Tyrion said to Jaime in the last book), 3 or 4 times PER CHAPTER.<br /><br />5) the Cersei chapters, while helping to advance the plot, are told from a completely insane point of view.<br /><br />I really feel that once Martin chopped the book in half (it was getting too big, and he claims that publishers wouldn't print it), he was left with not enough material for a full book, and threw in some extra, useless, stuff.<br /><br />But, I also think that this book is worth reading.  It's useful filler.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) it does advance, somewhat, the most gripping fantasy plot I've  ever read.<br /><br />2) The bits that work (the climactic Dorne chapter, for example), are really superb.  Some of the future twists he hints at are fantastic.<br /><br />3) Martin can just flat-out write.  He's able to create a feeling of suspense where other authors would be boring you to tears.<br /><br />I do wish that he'd cut some POVs entirely, and that there was at least one chapter as heart-poundingly exciting as the Red Wedding or the Red Viper/Gregor Clegane fight in A Storm Of Swords.  But he didn't, and the book was still interesting.  I saw Martin speak at a signing, and he spoke about how he intended the book to be atrilogy, but that \\"A tale grows in the telling\\"(quoting Tolkien).  While I agree that this (so-far) magnificent story could not be confined to 3 stories, I'm hoping that it doesn't stretch out past the now-estimated 7.<br /><br />In my opinion, this deserves 2.5 stars -- I'm rounding down and hoping for 1) a better effort in A Dance With Dragons and 2) an end to this series before I die.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I purchased recently Enya's latest CD Amarantine, and expected exactly what I got--more Enya, just a later date. I thought her compositions were well done and of course the instrumentation is fabulous. However, I was expected something different and didn't receive it. Has Enya lost some of her creativity, since tracks like It's In the Rain is a close sister to China Roses, The River Sings is reminiscent to Ebudae and Sumiguesa or Wild Violet is quite similar to La Sonyadora. I have always taken issue when a composure seems to begin losing original material. I have to admit, the title track is impressive and Enya can take the notes in perfect pitch, but tracks like the previous and even Less Than a Pearl didn't impress me. It was as if Enya was warming up, experimenting with chords in Less Than a Pearl. The slow, supposedly more meaningful songs like If I Could Be Where You Are and A Moment Lost after a while lose their sentamental luster when you continually emphasize sad introspective lyrics all the time. Try some lyrics more fast paced and creative. Is this what New Age music is all about? IF it is, I am ready for a change.  <br />Don't get me wrong. I am a big Enya fan and probably always will be, but the main focus is to keep material original and different. Keep your audience guessing what is coming next and never let them down. <br />Thank you for your time, Chad

WOW, was I completely dissapointed with this movie.  Long, boring, the plot is dumb, Scarlett Johannsen is nothing special, and unfortunately neither is Bill Murray, and the ending sucks.  This was one of those movies where when the credits roll you look around and think \\"did I actually just waste 102 minutes of my life on this?\\"  It is definitely in my \\"steaming pile of crap\\" movie category.  The ONLY reason why anyone even heard anything about this movie is because SOPHIA COPPOLA directed it and actually WON BEST DIRECTOR for it.  Obviously there were some major politics involved in that award.

B0001XALT6|4.0|In the DVD documentary, Sylvester Stallone mentions the amazing fact of him co-starring in this film with Robert De Niro, since they went into completely different film genres after both actors were nominated for Best Actor in 1976: Stallone for Rocky and De Niro for Taxi Driver.  They had their superficial similarities, with both actors portraying angry, vengeful working-class Italian-Americans - but Stallone and De Niro represented opposite poles of post-war America.  <br /> <br />De Niro's Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), flawed boxing champ Jake La Motta in Raging Bull (1983) and comedian-wannabe Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy (1983) lived and created the American nightmare of obsessive, lonely nobodies gaining public recognition through savage violence and mediocre showbiz.   <br /> <br />In contrast, Stallone's boxing champ Rocky Balboa in Rocky (1976), in contrast, believed and represented the American dream of wholesome opportunity, fame and love for lonely nobodies. His Vietnam vet John Rambo also, like the 1970s antihero created by novelist David Morrell and De Niro's Bickle, brought the war to America in First Blood (1982) but then single-handedly brought about Reagan-era Cold War victories in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Rambo III (1988).  His country singer-wannabe in Rhinestone (1984), unlike De Niro's Pupkin, uncritically and unambiguously celebrated the Rocky \\"bum making it big\\" theme, as did Stallone's Rocky-esque transformation of Travolta's 1970s angry anti-hero Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever (1977) into a 1980s Broadway star (with Rambo physique) in Staying Alive (1983).  Unlike De Niro's honest portrayal of the brutal behaviour of gangster Noodles in Once Upon A Time in the West (1984), Stallone tried to make a blue-collar hero out of the corrupt trade unionist Johnny Kovac in F.I.S.T. (1978, see my Amazon review of this DVD).    <br /> <br />Thus, De Niro has been regarded as the best actor of his generation,whereas Stallone received an award for worst actor of the twentieth century.  By the mid-1990s Stallone lost all professional credibility with his monosyllabic, muscular superheroes and was looking at something completely different in order to save his foundering career.  And what better opportunity than this ensemble film with a cast of New York Method Actor gurus who appeared in critically acclaimed films directed by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrara.  Robert De Niro, who appeared in seven Scorsese-directed films,including Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King of Comedy, Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995).  Harvey Keitel, having delivered some of his best performances under both Scorsese (including Mean Streets and Taxi Driver) and Ferrara.  Ray Liotta, who delivered an impressive performance in Goodfellas.  Cathy Moriarty, who delivered an impressive debut film performance opposite De Niro in Raging Bull.  Frank Vincent, playing strong supportive parts in Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Casino.  Annabella Sciorra, who appeared in two Ferrara films in the 1990s (The Funeral and The Addiction). <br /> <br />And, believe it or not, Stallone did not only LEAD this impressive ensemble cast, he managed to pull off a critically acclaimed performance that shocked his critics.  And, like De Niro's La Motta in Raging Bull, his strong performance was also marked by Method Actor devotion translating into substantial (30 pounds) weight gains to play the overweight sheriff.  (Compare the scene of a fat Stallone lying on the bed in the director's cut with a bloated, drunk La Motta just before he is arrested by the police.) <br />
B000002J1U|5.0|This album is great.  It shows EXACTLY what Jimmy Page means when he talks about \\"light and shade.\\"  He said that the heavy stuff isn't as heavy without the lighter stuff.  Page's philosophy was that dynamics was what really made music.  On their hard music, there is no killer distortion or crazy-low tunings.  Zeppelin was a hard, intense band because they had an idea about dynamics.  He is quoted as saying that their name, though originally a joke, was a perfect explanation of their music: \\"lead\\" being something heavy, while a \\"zeppelin\\" floats.  Page prided himself on this notion of light and shade, and the llight makes the dark even more so.  \\"Since I've Been Lovin' You\\" is a perfect example of this.  Thi song is SO SOULFUL (especially listen to the live version on the second disc of the BBC sessions). Page, plant, Bonham and Jones all know when to turn it up, and when to turn it down. <br />As far as the acoustic songs go, how can anyone say that \\"Gallows Pole' or \\"Friends\\" are SOFT?  They still have an intensity about them that grabs you.  Zeppelin showed this affinity for acousitc music on their first 2 albums as well (\\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You (inspired by Joan Baez's cover of an old folk song)\\" \\"Ramble On,\\" \\"Black Mountain Side).  The sweet melody of \\"That's the Way\\" and the tenderness of \\"Tangerine\\" aside, the acoustic numbers on this album are NOT soft.  That's like calling \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" off the next album soft.  HOW INTENSE!  This is a great album that shows Page's musical insight, the range of influences the band brought to the table, and a good set-up for their legendary next album.  BUY IT!
B00004BZ16|4.0|While it probably isn't worth 5 stars and you won't see it on many \\"Top 100 Greatest Albums\\" lists, Sandinista! is still WELL worth the price and quite an entertaining listen.      If you've been able to successfully sit through RHCP's post-1990 albums, either of Sublime's albums, or the The Rolling Stone's Exile..., you can probably handle this.  And unlike those albums, there isn't any misogynism or hedonism in the lyrics.  You may not agree with the Clash's political stance (and I must admit that I sometimes don't), but at least they're trying to make a positive impact on the world.     If you are listening for the first time, it helps to view this as a double album with a bonus LP (tracks 7-18 on the 2nd CD) thrown in.  Once \\"Lose This Skin\\" starts, the record becomes pretty weird and surreal.  It's still entertaining though.  I recall listening to both discs straight through while cleaning out my house, and it really did seem to make sense.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just bought this last night and have been watching and listening most of the day. <br />If you are a LZ fan of any caliber, you will LOVE this. <br />Filled with 5-hours of concert performances spanning ten years, the production of these discs are very, very professional.  Integrated bootleg films with official footage of the concert tours starting at Royal Albert Hall in 1970 to Knebworth in 1979 in one of their last performances are masterfully compiled and edited by Mr. Jimmy Page himself. <br />You can see for yourself just how truly gifted and honed these musicians were.  I found myself watching and listening with my mouth open and in a half daze. <br />The sound quality is exceptional even for the age of the taped recordings and the technique of the original recording processes. <br />I would even venture to recommend this to someone who doesn't even like LZ.  These performances would change your mind and make you a believer. <br />And for those who constantly compare Clapton to Beck and Beck to Page and Page to Clapton...let me tell you that Page has them all beat many times over.  Page and his Les Paul come alive as one entity. <br />This is a truly amazing production and highly, highly rated. <br />
B000BVD460|5.0|Well, obviously, this is a fantastic Eminem album. You have to remember that this contains his greatest hits from his previous albums, so that inevitably makes this album a very good one. <br /> <br />There are 3 additions: Fack, a the-real-slim-shady type of song, which is what Eminem does in every single album. It's funny and outrageous. \\"Shake that\\" is also a good addition, and finally the one we've all heard and love, \\"When I'm gone\\" <br /> <br />Over all, this is lovely album. If you're an Eminem fan, then you should get this. <br /> <br />If you're not an Eminem fan, but loved most of his past singles yet wouldn't buy the albums because you weren't sure if you'd love the other songs there, then get this one.  <br /> <br />If you don't fit into any of these categories, then, well, don't bother.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Prison.<br /><br />Since Cain painted the fields with Abel's blood, the race of Man has favored exile for the criminal, a swift separation from the society against which he has transgressed. Cain and kin were dispatched to the East of Eden, and mankind has been adept at following their example in bringing the lash and levy against the cruel, the calculating, the wicked, the insolent, and the criminally stupid ever since.<br /><br />We have exiled our felons deep beneath the Earth, to toil in the Stygian darkness of mines or languish in the bone-littered dungeons of dank and hungry oubliettes. We have built towering prisons to hold the unwanted on forlorn spits of rock in the sea: hark the names of the most notorious---Rikers, Alcatraz, Devil's Island, the Chateau D'If.<br /><br />The Convict will suffer, yes, and pay his debt to Society, all in due course: but first we will confine and isolate him.<br /><br />And for all the stone, and sweat, and blood, and steel, iron portcullises and electric mag-lock gates, the Hole and Death Row and the Green Mile, the ultimate prison is still born of our own design: the human mind.<br /><br />Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) has one problem too many: he hasn't slept in a year. He's shucking off the pounds at a rate that would boggle Jenny Craig; he's drifting down to 120 and dropping, dropping, dropping.<br /><br />And it gets worse: he can't trust his own thoughts, his senses, the things he glimpses, the horror he fancies he sees. He is pursued---but by whom? He remembers dragging a body, shoving it rudely down into a drainage ditch---but whose? And to what end? He claims that his shadowy watchers would come for him, if only they knew who he was.<br /><br />But who is he?<br /><br />And as if to underscore his wild fancies, a series of post-it notes now appear on his refrigerator door, scribbled with odd, cryptic little messages, and---more menacingly---a rapidly progressing game of Hangman.<br /><br />Oh, and then there's Ivan, his ghoulish, portly, evilly jocular new co-worker on the machine line. Ivan, with two toes affixed to missing finger-joints (\\"...and the ladies love it!\\" he chortles, wiggling the outsized digits in Reznick's horrified face). Ivan, the new co-worker who no one else sees.<br /><br />Is it any wonder he can't sleep?<br /><br />Director Brad Anderson proved his skills at plumbing and twisting the intricate workings of the tortured human mind with \\"Sesson 9\\": \\"The Machinist\\" shows Anderson has only honed his craft with time. \\"Machinist\\" is in some ways a more ambitious effort, a bracing, brooding, menacing jaunt into dark territory Kafka would recognize and Dostoevsky would understand.<br /><br />To divulge any more of \\"The Machinists\\" secrets would be criminal: 90% of the fun of this creeper lies in following close on the tormented Reznick's heels, and drinking the mystery into the pores.<br /><br />The acting is superb: Bale turns out an astonishing performance that goes far beyond the physical sacrifice he made for \\"The Machinist\\". Bale displays a ghastly, measured restraint---he is wondrously attentive, rapturously alert, to all the little changes in his circumscribed existence. Bale serves up a mesmerizing picture of a warped, fragile, and doggedly curious soul determined to plumb the depths of the horrors taking place inside his skull and---more ominously---on the the factory floor.<br /><br />John Sharian (the mysterious Ivan)is 360-degrees of hulking, drawling menace, insultingly, ominously, unctuously oily and affable at once: he dominates every scene like some depraved, hungry, joking ogre at dinner---and you can be sure the joke's on you. And the dinner, as well.<br /><br />The still-gorgeous Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Stevie) and Italian beauty Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Marie) round out a stellar cast as Reznick's precarious anchors of sanity in a world increasingly gone mad---precarious as one is a call-girl and the other a short-order waitress in a dingy, flickeringly-lit diner where even Time itself seems in peril. And Michael Ironside (Miller)growls and grunts and snarls in fine Ironside fashion, and proves he really should keep his hands away from sharp objects (first in \\"Starship Troopers\\", and now this? Mind the pointy things, Mike!).<br /><br />The cinematography is well-lashed to the paranoid creepiness: the film sprawls out, and slithers around, its industrial slagscape, a twilight land of blues and greys, dingy factories spiked by smokestacks, dotted with dive bars that stink of stale cigarettes and regret. And interiors---the interior of a machinery-clogged and blood-hungry factory line, the interior of a dirty apartment, the interior of a diseased and terrified mind.<br /><br />Prison.<br /><br />JSGer a short-order waitress in a dingy, flickeringly-lit diner where even Time itself seems in peril.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Mesmerize seemed to be the transistion alblum this amazing alblum. It's a throwback to the older CD's and the songs are so dynamic. Definately not Underworld dynamic but extremly dynamic for a rock band. This isnt nu-metal at all. And my favorite songs off of Mesmerize sound more like ones on Hypnotize. A huge change now is Daron's and Serj's voices are working together instead of separately this along with way more changes within in the song make this one of thier best. It does have a more cohesive sound to it whereas mesmerize had experimental stuff going on all over. As with Mesmerize they have gone more political, focusing on the war and war in general. With this alblum they proved they could better themselves and i cant wait for the next alblum now.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Man, talk about bad timing!<br /><br />Let's say you're happy-go-lucky college kids heading home for college break: brother Darius (Justin Long), sis Trish (Gina Philips), two kids motoring it across those lonely, barren stretches of miles and miles of---well, miles and miles.<br /><br />You'd think that in America these days, we've digitally connected and sewn up every last b*stard inch of the Great Lonely Howling Spaces, that we've blasted microfiger and digital optic networks and cable stations with five-thousand channels into the back of beyond: that there really is no wild stretch of highway where the normal laws and conventions of society hold sway.<br /><br />Oh, but there is. Go on a road trip: look at all those lonely diners marooned along vast, forsaken strips of blacktop. Take one of those empty little roads to nowhere, three turns away from the Interstate: go bumpity-bump down a dusty trail to a gas-n'-go that closes shop on Sunday because---well, there's just no business in these parts on Sunday, Old Hoss.<br /><br />Flip the radio on right about now: chances are you're going to get a load of Jesus. Come to the Lord! Hell awaits! Satan stalking the Earth, hungry as a lion, seeking those who He can devour, Hallelujah!<br /><br />Thousands of Americans disappear every year, in our great interconnected Republic: it's true, many run away, change their names, disappear, start new lives.<br /><br />But it's also true, I think, that many of them set out on road trips, and get eaten alive.<br /><br />So you're Darius and Trish, and you have the worst timing ever. Because, see, on this particular stretch of blacktop, you've got this Thing. A Troll, let's say: an Ogre, the Boogeyman, a Monster. Every twenty-three years it awakens: for 23 days, it gets to Eat. And by Jesus, it sure is hungry!<br /><br />Timing is everything.<br /><br />Now: director Victor Salva is a real sicky: I'm going to avoid into the man's history of pedophilia---though I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way. The Creeper doesn't just stalk Darius---he has a lark sniffing his undies!<br /><br />But look: the true ghoulish glory of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" lies in its simplicity: you're on the road, you're tired, you're hungry, you want to sleep. Without meaning to, you see a dark, hulking figure---all inky shadows in its duster and broad-brimmed hat---dumping what appear to be bodies down a corrugated pipe, into God knows where.<br /><br />It sees you.<br /><br />And oh God, though you wish it weren't so---though you later wish desperately you hadn't seen *it*---it comes hunting for you.<br /><br />It's outside your window right now. Looking in.<br /><br />That's the guts and bloody viscera of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\"---forget the goofy psychic lady, forget the gratuitous Eileen Brennan---and focus down on the dark, stark, deeply twisted sickness of this flick about the Boogeyman hot on your trail, looking you up, coming calling to your bedside to give you one of those great parting gifts and---oh yes---a long, sweet kiss in the Dark.<br /><br />Pucker up.<br /><br />JSGugh I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way.

B000BJS4SU|1.0|Just dont get it. I know guitar playing. When i hear john mayer , all i hear is repetition, nothing sincere. It is sooo obvious he went to Berkely school of music, his playing is well....too technical..not enough emotion...it just sounds fake to me. He just isnt the real deal. Its the same way clapton always sounds like an outsider, he's good just like mayer but he never had that special something to take him to the next level. Im afraid mayer shares his fate. I know i will get JM fans hating me for this review, but oh well...i dont hold the man in the same regard as they do...i just dont see what they see i guess. Everything he does on this record , in my opinion, just sounds so forced.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This may not be the best ever scifi show on earth, but it was unique in its own right and despite being mistreated by Fox during its original run, it has managed to build and maintain a loyal fan base and spawned a theatrical release (available separately from Amazon). <br /> <br />If any TV executives are reading this, they should realize that this would be a great pickup for them. There is a build-in fan-base and the re-emergenence of the genre (from LOTR, other theatrical releases, to BSG, Stargates, Lost, 4400, Invasion, Surface, Triangle, etc) would bode very well for new episodes of Firefly. <br /> <br />All in all, this DVD set is very reasonably priced for what you are getting: a quality and rather unique/original sci-fi show.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Firstly, may i just say that mariah has never been particularly talented, in terms of creativity and musical instinct. Her music has always been a blurred mix of paper-thin instrumentation, and weak vocals. She has never set any trends, but rather followed already well established ones. She doesn't aim to push boundaries with her albums, but simply opt for what is safe and radio digestive. <br /> <br />Many will disagree with me, but Mariah will never be remembered for her contributions to popular culture, nor her public persona or image. All she will be remembered for is the numbers she ranked up by sales. However, sales are in no way an indication of talent, nor does it earn an artist any respect musically. <br /> <br />Now, onto this so called 'emancipation' album. when i first heard this album, all I could think about was how friendly everything sounds. Nothing here seems confronting or personal, on any level. Isn't the emancipation of someone meant to be a carthartic confrontation with one's inner demons, and thus the freeing of one's mind. Most songs here are about relationships and getting a number from some guy up in the club. How mariah fans can call this an emancipation is beyond me. <br /> <br />Simply put, this album is nothing more than a calculated 'hit' album, and is a sell-out in the most classic of terms.  <br /> <br />
B00005LQ04|1.0|My metric I use to guage the worth of a horror film is relatively simple: Does it scare me?  The answer in this case is an unequivocal NO. <br /> <br />The acting is thin, the plot hardly sustainable and the cinematogrophy average at best.  There are simply very few redeeming qualities in this movie. <br /> <br />The most frightening aspect in this anti-climactic absurdity is the acting (and the dubbing).  Scary stuff indeed.  The soundtrack is passable, but tolerable music does not a horrifying movie make.  You can't polish a turd.  <br /> <br />I sincerely can not understand the positive reviews this cinematic atrocity has garnered.
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris has written the most important book published this century. It is a must read for atheists and people of faith. Harris points out the many absurdities of religious fundamentalism. He rightly rips the Bible for being a book of hate, not of love. More importantly, he pulls no punches in attacking the most dangerous religion of all, Islam. Harris dispenses with the P.C. myth common to our time, namely that the true Islam is being perverted by Bin Laden and his followers. He shows, with quotes from the Koran to support his case, that Islam itself is the problem. Suicide bombers are folowing the Koran, not perverting it.<br /><br />I urge everyone to read this book, especially Chapter 4, the critique of Islam previously mentioned. I know that many religious people will disagree with Harris, but I urge them to approach it with an open mind. He makes a logical, rational case that religion is harming America. One example he uses is stem cell research, which is being blocked even today by religious zealots in the U.S. Congress. He also points to our destructive \\"war on drugs\\" and anti-sodomy laws, which he blames on Christian fundamentalists obsessed with criminalizing conduct they don't approve of.<br /><br />Harris also takes on the far left, which made me like his book even more. He rightly criticizes Noam Chomsky and others on the far left for moral equivalency, i.e. saying the U.S. is no better than Al-Qaeda because civilians die in our wars. He points out that our intentions are far superior to those of the terrorists in the Muslim world.<br /><br />My only small complaint was that he urges one-world government as a solution to religious fundamentalism. I don't think that would make any difference, and we would lose all our national sovereignty under such a government.  This is a minor quibble, though. I still highly recommend this book.
B000058983|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully put together and performed albums I have ever heard.  Every song has a purpose, and every song has a distinct message.  It is an absolute joy to listen to this dynamic and in many ways perfect album.  It makes you think and allows you to get lost in the lyrics.  I had never heard of Love before I heard this album, and I have since listened to their other albums but did not find them equally moving.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music.  I can't really even compare it with anything or give a generic \\"If you like ______ then you will love this\\" because it is really honestly different than anyone else, and in a mind blowing way.  Definitely give the sample clips a listen and if you like the sound of them you will love this album.<br /><br />This album mixes different musical stylings, with its roots firmly planted in the psychadelic sounds of its era.  But many of the songs have a blissful orchestral element added to their backgrounds, making the songs very rich and full sounding.  One of the songs which sticks out for me is \\"Andmoreagain\\" (Track 3).  This song is VERY beautiful and has a string section and spanish like guitar sound implanted perfectly into its background.  And the song is thought provoking as well.  This is just one example that typifies the beauty throughout this album.  The song \\"The Red Telephone\\" is very eery and has its basis in the cold war/communism which was obviously a prominent thought in 1967. The darkness of the cold war cuts through the track and you are left with a very real sense of paranoia and uneasiness when the song closes with a chant of \\"They're locking them up today, they're throwing away the key, I wonder who it will be tomorrow, you or me...\\"  I will not ramble on about all of the songs, as you need to experience them yourself.  I would like to say my favorite line from all of the songs (from \\"You Set the Scene\\" - my favorite on the album, and basically Arthur Lee's goodbye to the world song as he was sure he was dying during the making of this album):<br /><br />\\"And for anyone who thinks that life is just a game, Do you like the part you're playing?\\"  - Arthur Lee<br /><br />Just one of the many brilliant lyrics in this album which I can't give enough praise.  Musically, lyrically, production wise, this album is almost perfect.  It is as though the best elements of the Beatles psychadelic albums (notably Sgt. Pepper) was mixed in with a little bit of crazy thought provoking lyrics (a la Pink Floyd - before AND during the Roger Waters era) and set to a great musical score, but this combination still doesn't do this album justice as it is a very \\"different\\" album in the greatest way possible.<br /><br />With all that said, I must give this album five stars as it easily ranks near the top of my list as one of the greatest albums ever.  Rolling Stone agrees, placing it at #40 all time.  I have to disagree with that ranking as I own all 39 of the previous album and I think musically this album is better than many of those which precede it.  I cannot speak for its effect on society since I am still young, and was not around when this was released.  In any case it will do any music lover good to get and to study this album.  A masterpiece.orld song as he was sure he was dying during the making of this album):    \\"And for anyone who thinks that life is just a game, Do you like the part you're playing?\\"  - Arthur Lee    Just one of the many brilliant lyrics in this album which I can't give enough praise.

6302150930|3.0|Compelling as the story is I would not try to condense it into a feature length movie.  It is a good movie - I was frankly disappointed because Hardy's novel is much richer and makes the reasoning of the characters much more discernable.  I would recommend anyone to read the novel and watch the movie as a light distraction.  You will enjoy the movie more if you've never read the book.
0156029065|5.0|This is an entertaining read.<br /><br />\\"Baudolino\\", by Umberto Eco, is a tale of grand adventure and intrigue: the setting is in Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire during the late 12th and early 13th centuries.

I really looked forward to finding time to keep returning to this book.<br /><br />If you like Umberto Eco's style of writing then you will enjoy this book. Recommended.
0679731725|5.0|The only reference in this book of the title occurs on its second to last page: \\"Perhaps, then, there is something to his advice that I should cease looking back so much...\\"  Notwithstanding the above, this book is not at all melancholy or particularly depressing, although Stevens (the butler character/narrator) does look back much. The whole book is a reminiscence actually.  Stevens played a role and did so ably, very much obsessed with dignity and continuing on, ala the British since the Second World War, but not to the same successful extent.  I suppose you can draw many parallels here: Stevens, the British butler in England, serving an American, trying to uphold his dignity and being beholden to an era that was passing and is now gone, but the book is an enjoyable read without having to \\"read\\" anything into the story as it unfolds.  The film that is based on this book was excellent too, but seems to make the story very much more  political, stressing the \\"little guys\\" of society (Stevens included) trusting to British gentlemen to do the \\"right thing\\" by them.  The book, in contradistinction, seems to stress, in a different manner, that the \\"little guy\\" who trusts others winds up being one who cannot say at least that one's own mistakes were one's own; but that to trust \\"gentlemen\\" types and ones simple devotion to duty may cost you, that a person should have personal accountability.  Stevens trusted Darlington Hall and his role as a part of it, and in so doing believed his work was consequently paramount and of a particular importance; that, in a way, he was part of something good and/or had some part in effecting developements made by those men of politics who peopled the manor he served.  So his trust engendered duty and duty negated personal fulfillment.  He lived not for \\"The remains of the day\\", but for his work.  In so doing he consequently missed out on a possible romance---with a Miss Kenton in the story, not owing to his own fault, but because he trusted Darlington Hall, so to speak.  The key to human warmth, Stevens  ponders at the end, may lie in bantering; just the sort of thing he had no time for while Miss Kenton herself was employed at Darlington Hall.  What makes this well told story  unique, however, is the author's writing style. A sample: \\"It seems increasingly likely that I will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.  An expedition, I should say, which I will undertake alone, in the comfort of Mr. Farraday's Ford; an expedition which, as I forsee it, will take me through the finest countryside of England to the West country, and may keep me away from Darlington Hall for as much as five or six days.\\"  That's the opening paragraph to this concisely written joy to read; and it goes on thusly for 245 pages as Stevens tells us the story of his devotion to duty during his journey to see Miss Kenton after many years.  This is a book that lingers with you and which can be re-read with pleasure. Cheers!d Darlington Hall, so to speak.

B00005MAM2|5.0|Based off of the manga series of the same name, Katsuhiro Ôtomo presents a film that has set the standard for excellent anime and introduced main stream America the glory of Japanese Animation.  Many feel that people not familiar with Anime should watch this film first.  That I believe is a bad idea for many reasons: 1)the film is very complex and ambiguous leaving the viewer with more \\"what the **** just happened here?\\" moments than a newbie would want; 2)lots of gore (which is present in alot of action anime but newbies will confuse this with being a standard of all anime); 3)read point 1 again.  This is not to say that Akira is not a masterpiece.  On the contrary, this is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of anime in history.  Beautiful art, mesmorizing soundtrack/music, believable characters that you care about, mystery, lots of action, lasers :)...what more can you want?<br /><br />For those who are new to anime, look at some of Hayao Miyazaki's more user friendly pieces like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away before tackling a monster like Akira.  Those who are supposed veterans of anime, and you haven't seen Akira...WHAT ROCK HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING UNDER!?!?  Go and see Akira and see what the hype's about.
B000002U82|5.0|I just bought this albuma  few days ago, and I just can't stop listening to it. Probably their Magnum Opus, this album has onyl nine tracks on it, but ALL of them are woth listening to. \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Us and Them\\", \\"Money\\", \\"On The Run(widely considered to the be the first-ever techno song), \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", the whole album is a joy to listen to, and yes, Roger Waters didn't do everything himself. I would recommend this album for anyone who has never heard their music before. Forget \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Echoes\\", even though those albums are classics, this is easily their best, and will have you listening to it constantly.
B00000DGUY|5.0|I read in an interview that Mark Knopfler considered his guitar technique to be limited by his lack of speed.  Certainly there are those who seek minor guitar deities to worship who exhibit as their defining characteristic the ability to speed up and down the neck of their six-string.  My wife says that some pianists sound like a mouse running around on the keyboard.  I would argue that these guitarists are the string equivalent of the \\"running around on the keyboard\\" pianists.  I won't bother naming names - if you've gotten this far in my review you can probably already name 2 or 3.<br /><br />This bring us to Mark Knopfler, who admits that he is not as \\"fast\\" as some.  Why is his music so popular, then?  Why do musicians such as Chet Atkins actively seek Mark out for musical projects?  The answer is clearly that Mr. Knopfler is sublimely \\"musical\\".  His tunes are tasty and he performs them with a sure-handed style that I think I could describe as \\"the right notes at the right time.\\"  His voice is not Steven Tyler's or Sinatra's, but can you imagine anyone else crooning lines like \\"money for nothin', and the chicks for free\\"?<br /><br />On the title tune of this collection: \\"Sultans of Swing\\" makes the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of songs that have been most influential in shaping rock and roll.  (No other Dire Straits tunes made the top 500, although a good case could have been made for several including \\"Walk of Life\\", \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Money for Nothing\\" from just the \\"Brothers In Arms\\" CD.  \\"Sultans\\" stands atop the heap, though, and rightfully so.  It's a seductively skillful ballad, with Mark's Straits companions laying down a simple vamping pocket for him to create his masterpiece about the band that plays for their own pleasure.  It is ironic that \\"Sultans\\" has become so popular because the song depicts a skillful band that could care less about popularity - they play Creole and other music that is ignored by the boys in their \\"platform soles\\" who \\"don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band, it ain't what they call ROCK and ROLL!\\"  For any musician who has even contemplated straddling that fence between popularity and pandering to the \\"fans\\" who could care less about the quality of the music - \\"Sultans of Swing\\" is like a national anthem for any musician who devoted themselves to the music.<br /><br />This collection combines \\"Sultans\\" with noticeably many cuts from the previously mentioned \\"Brothers in Arms\\", including the title cut from that collection.  It also includes Knopler's fine theme from the equally fine film \\"Local Hero\\" performed live.<br /><br />As long as people care about popular music recorded in the 20th century, they will be listening to Dire Straits.o \\"don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band, it ain't what they call ROCK and ROLL!\\"  For any musician who has even contemplated straddling that fence between popularity and pandering to the \\"fans\\" who could care less about the quality of the music - \\"Sultans of Swing\\" is like a national anthem for any musician who devoted themselves to the music. <br /> <br />This collection combines \\"Sultans\\" with noticeably many cuts from the previously mentioned \\"Brothers in Arms\\", including the title cut from that collection.

0783225857|5.0|Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.<br /><br />Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to \\"Hollywood\\".  She needn't have worried.<br /><br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many \\"100 Greatest...\\" lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of \\"Greatest Screen Heroes\\", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from \\"Casablanca\\".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a \\"white trash\\" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.<br /><br />Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.<br /><br />Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful \\"victim\\" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.<br /><br />In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.  But the days of Emmitt Till seem long ago and far away.  It took something to change the minds or racist Southerners not that many generations away from slavery.  \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.  It's that important.away.

0307276902|5.0|Worried that the hype surrounding James Frey's autobiographical book was just that, I approached his Oprah-selection book with some trepidation, but I am pleased to report that this is indeed a must-read, a genuinely absorbing, often harrowing account of one man's addiction and recovery process. His idiosyncratic writing style - full of curtailed paragraphs, stream-of-consciousness meandering, punctuation and capitalization that would drive Lynne Truss up the wall - initially smacked of posturing, but it gains strength from his rigorous honesty.<br /><br />His voice reminds me of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" as if Randle P. McMurphy were narrating his own story. However, the sight of the 23-year old Frey must have been even more brutalizing. At the outset, he is missing four of his front teeth, has a broken nose and cheekbone, and there is a hole in his cheek large enough for him to stick two of his fingers through. His clothes are covered with all his internal bile, self-induced liquids that come up quite often throughout the book. His nightmares are inhabited with alcohol, crack-cocaine and crystal-meth, and when he awakens, he vomits chunks of stomach wall into the toilet.<br /><br />Getting himself to a renowned treatment center (Hazelden in real life though the institution remains anonymous in the book), Frey goes through a series of medical evaluations and is told in order to live, he will need to give up a ten-year addiction to alcohol and a three-year addiction to crack. Battling thoughts of suicide by drug abuse, he fluctuates from enraged to hopeless and back again. However, the book is not entirely unrelenting, as Frey injects a biting black humor that allows him to plumb the emotional depths while letting the reader absorb his invectives as almost poetic profanity.<br /><br />The recovery scenes have the raw feel of people under pressure as they are forced to co-exist with their faults fully exposed to their fellow inmates. Frey provides sharp portraits such as Miles, the weak-willed, black Federal circuit court judge; Leonard, the thoughtful mobster who does not seem what he appears to be; and most incisively, Roy, who takes an instant dislike to Frey. This is all contrasted effectively with his affluent upbringing and perfectly attired parents, who are certainly no the villains of the piece but somehow enablers nonetheless. Frey is far from a victim of neglect though as his atypically hell-bent past included torturing fellow children when he was young, forcing a girl in college to snort cocaine off his penis and almost beating a priest to death.<br /><br />Although the outcome is obvious, Frey keeps the readers in suspense by convincingly putting us into his own addled, addicted mind. Perhaps most controversially to the consternation of AA and other established treatment programs, Frey reasonably scorns twelve-step programs and embraces Taoism, and his overriding honesty with himself - that he is an alcoholic, addict and criminal - gives the reader the sense a fortifying will that he claims will keep him clean. He has apparently kept up his discipline a decade later. This is a lacerating and ultimately poignant memoir of a man whose identity means nothing to us at the beginning but takes on the guise of everyman at the end. That is an accomplishment in itself.ovides sharp portraits such as Miles, the weak-willed, black Federal circuit court judge; Leonard, the thoughtful mobster who does not seem what he appears to be; and most incisively, Roy, who takes an instant dislike to Frey.

B00005JKCH|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying I'm a comic book fan, but not a Spider-Man fan.  Scratch that.  I like Spider-Man.  It's that whiny little Peter Parker I could do without.  Now, in the comics this isn't much of a problem.  We spend far more time with Spidey than his alter-ego.  In this film though, Parker dominates.  And every time he stands on screen looking miserable I just start to zone out. <br /> <br />Frankly, I just don't feel that bad for him.  The guy gets superpowers and keeps complaining about the terrible responsibility.  I know that's a theme of the comics, but Spidey in the comics always seems to handle it so much better.  His bad luck and poor me attitude never seemed excessively narcissistic.  Here Peter mopes through most of the film, and I reallly got sick of it. <br /> <br />On the upside, there's some nice action in this film.  Just not nearly enough of it.  But the Green Goblin looks kind of lame.  And that's saying something in a comic book universe.  It's not a bad film.  Just not very good and overlong.  Am I the only one who's noticed that movies are getting longer without getting better?  Editing makes or breaks a film, and this one could've easily been half-an-hour shorter. <br /> <br />Anyway, I've seen it twice and didn't hate it either time.  But I'd never watch it again, and I've absolutely no desire to see Spider-Man 2 based on this film.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I have been a rabid System fan since around `98 when I came across their self-titled album. And I have loved all the following albums put after it. When Mezmerize hit in May I wasn't happy with it.  <br /> <br />Unlike most people it wasn't the fact that Daron was singing a lot more, I got used to that pretty quickly. My problem with the album is that it just feels lazy. The music and lyrics are really simplistic in comparison to their other work. You'll have this album memorized after the first listen. It's the appeal and flaw of the album. <br /> <br />It comes across like a pop album, sure it's fun to sing along to, easy to get into, but it's pretty hollow. Even songs such as \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" come across as pretentious and seriously lacking any passion. I didn't hold compare this album to their previous work with an extreme bias, but when I put it next to their previous albums, it sounded like me to be a real attempt to sound more accessible commercially. <br /> <br />Here's how I rank the tracks: <br />Soldier Side ~ 4 out of 5.  One of the better intros I've heard on an album. <br /> <br />B.Y.O.B. ~ 3 out of 5.  The track starts off good, but after listening to it a few times it begins to grate. Word to the public, just because you use the lyric \\"Why don't Presidents fight the war, why do they always send the poor?\\" as your internet signature, doesn't make you smart or political. <br /> <br />Revenga ~ 5 out of 5.  One of the best on the album, rapid fire verses, insanely catchy chorus and one of the few well done songs on the album. <br /> <br />Cigaro ~ 2 out of 5.  This song is funny, but like a joke the first time you hear it, it's funny, then the more and more you hear it the less and less you find it funny, and eventually want people to stop telling it. One of the tracks I usually skip. <br /> <br />Radio/Video ~ 4 out of 5. Overall a simplistic song, but it gets me to sing at the top of my lungs when I am playing it in my car. A personal favorite.  <br /> <br/>This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song ~ 5 out of 5. Insane, bizarre and hyper. Classic System. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a b-side off their debut. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography ~ 0 out of 5. Although I want to give them credit for mocking the crap you see on television (at least I assume that's what this song is about) this song sucks. The lyrics are something anyone with an ounce of talent could have written, it just comes across as sophomoric and dumb.  <br /> <br />Question! ~ 5 out of 5. Best song on the album by a mile. It's the best blend of their old style and their newer attempts to become more melodic. Great song. <br /> <br />Sad Statue ~ 4 out of 5. Good song but the chorus becomes really repetitive by the end of the song. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood ~ 3 out of 5. I have to give them some credit for actually managing to cross metal with elements of new wave. But lyrically it sounds like something Weird Al Yankovic wouldn't even write. Tom Green maybe. <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood ~ 5 out of 5. Daron's singing really shines here, excellent song. <br /> <br />There are some quality tracks on this album, but it really pares in comparison to previous System works.
B0002XVQNU|2.0|Daredevil is another of those supers I just never really cared much about.  But this film does him absolutely no justice.  It's a prime example of non-comic writers trying to adapt material they don't understand.    I knew I was in trouble when they showed DD getting into a sensory deprivation tank.  In the comics, DD has perfect control of his senses.  He doesn't get overwhelmed easily.  It's just logical, folks.  I mean, Superman has far better hearing than DD, but you don't see him screaming and clutching his ears when a fly buzzes his head.  BAD SIGN#1    Next, DD fights a bunch of goons in a bar full of gunfire, screaming, and music.  That's a lot of noise, and it doesn't bother him then.  But minutes later a subway train whisks by and it throws off his senses.  That's contradictory and just silly.  Superheroes who get startled by loud noises are not particularly heroic.  BAD SIGN#2    In another scene Matt Murdock fights Electra on the street.  ON THE STREET.  IN PLAIN VIEW OF EVERYONE.  He's supposed to be blind for crying out loud.  Won't that draw some unwanted attention?  Superheroes with secret identities should know better.  Bruce Wayne doesn't throw batarangs at board meetings.  Clark Kent doesn't fly to work.  BAD SIGN#3    There's more, but why bother?  There's also precious little action in this film, and most of it is rather poorly executed.  And why in every @#!$! superhero movie do heroes always take off their masks?  Superheroes NEVER take off their masks.  But then again, I guess we wouldn't get to see hunky Ben Affleck, so what are you gonna do?    SIGH
B000BVEKO0|4.0|Korn's 7th studio album is a curious one. Its a throwback to more or less their Follow The Leader days. Gone are the angry screams of 2003's Take a Look in the Mirror, present are the hip-hop rock that made up their sound from 1996 to 1998.<br /><br />Is this a good thing? Well in my opinion yes. The sound they used throughout 1999 to 2003 was good, but beginning to go sour. I wouldn't go as far as saying Korn re-invented themselves with this one... Its nothing we haven't heard before. But it is a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Long time Korn fans will be happy to know that Jonathon uses scat and bagpipes on this one. A must have for Korn fans.
0062502182|5.0|This is a short book, but what it contains is something that can take some writers hundreds and hundreds of pages to explain.

No one is holding a gun to your head to buy any of the editions of this cd.   <br /> <br />If you want to make a point don't buy it!.  But it isn't any of your business if someone else chooses to.

B000AY3KN0|5.0|This is the coolest DVD set I own. From the packaging to the awesome 5'x7' King Kong posters replicas to a copy of the original program to the two insightful documentaries---this set has it all. It also comes with an offer for a free King Kong movie poster (with $4 S/H), so make sure you keep your receipt. <br /> <br />King Kong is presented with all the previously censored scenes  added back in (extra dino violence, Kong removing some of Ann's clothes---pretty tame stuff), so you can view it the way Cooper intended. The special effects still amaze, and after watching the making-of documentary, I have a new respect for stop-motion animators. King Kong's two-minute fight with the T-rex took a jaw-dropping seven weeks to film! Willis O-Brien, the animator on Kong, must have had nerves of steel.   <br /> <br />The picture is okay. Some scratches and fuzz here and there, and sometimes the picture \\"strobes\\" a bit, but these flaws are excusable given the age of the film. And allegedly they sought the best prints for each reel (fourteen altogether, I think), so it's not as if they just threw something together.  <br /> <br />The sound, I think, is where the DVD really excels. The mix is excellent. Dialogue and sound effects are clear, even over the film's phenomenal score. I've found the sound mix on other DVDs from the same era to be muddy, like Universal's monster collections. <br /> <br />In the extra features, you can see Kiwi director Peter Jackson's recreation of the lost so-called spider pit sequence. He and his crew at Weta designed creatures from old 1930s production stills and filmed the grisly scene (in stop-motion, of course) in which sailors are attacked and killed by prehistoric monsters, one of which looks uncannily like the watcher in the water from Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.  <br /> <br />Since Peter Jackson directed the new King Kong, and since he's been a Kong fan since childhood, he appears in the making-of documentary A LOT. After a while I forgot I was watching the Kong DVD and thought I was watching the Lord of the Rings extra features.     <br /> <br />You cannot go wrong with this DVD set. Even if all the goodies weren't included, Kong would still be an essential addition to any serious fan's film collection. Kong revolutionized not only visual effects but also sound effects and film scoring. Plus, it was the first time audiences were asked to sympathize with a special effect---an 18' puppet covered in rabbit fur.    <br /> <br />Buy it now and tell studios that this is the sort of quality we expect to see in DVDs.  <br /> <br />
B000AARKO4|1.0|I am a medieval history nut. I also like cinematic battle scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Gladiator\\". So the fact that Ridley Scott was going to produce an epic about the Crusades had me frothing at the mouth in anticipation. However before seeing the film I was warned by a friend that \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was a disaster and that I would be disappointed. My friend underexaggerated. This film is just flat out bad. To begin with the storyline jumps about a toddler with ADHD. Nothing is given any depth and the characters are superficial. The computer animations are too evident making some of the grandiose scenes look like a cartoon. And the battle scenes.... don't expect to see a Braveheart level of quality. That had to be the biggest disappointment.  <br /> <br />What was not unexpected was the PC nature of the film. That seems to be common fare in Hollywood these days. The skinny on this film is that the Christians (or at least the believers) are bad and the Muslims and the \\"secularists\\" are noble. It was done in as simplistic a manner as the rest of the story. By the end of the film I was getting nauseous.
B0002STNQ2|3.0|I liked this book because it was a fast easy read, even with the technical jargon. If you haven't read any of Crichton's books, he formats his writing in each chapter by writing a few sections of the story, then he will write a section about the technical background in the story.<br /><br />I think this story is similar to a lot of his books, in the sense that the characters are trying to esape by getting off an island (or in this case a buidling), and that Crichton uses the same \\"nature/technology runs amok theme.\\"<br /><br />I really liked the first 3/4ths of the book, then the last 1/4 was just...I don't know, what's the word...cheesy. I don't know if Crichton had a deadline to meet, but the ending felt rushed. The whole \\"invasion of the body snatchers\\" part of the book has been done before, why oh why did Crichton thought it would be good for this book?
B00006AW2M|4.0|The thing I usually find missing in reviews is that \\"Satanic\\" is both a putdown of psychedelia and a serious attempt at it. That's the rub. Unlike Zappa's \\"We're Only in It for the Money\\" (what he meant was \\"They're\\", they being the Beatles), \\"SM\\" gets in trouble stradding the fence. Of course since the Beatles played on it without credit slapping them in the face was perhaps not kosher. The irony and humor in the album is much clearer in this brilliant transfer, but the \\"Sing\\" reprise as noted falls flat on its face. If you hear the outtakes, it was a brilliant Morrocan influenced 14 minute jam with the Beatles sitting in but by adding Jagger's vapid lyric and vocal over a very bluntly cut version of it, they destroyed what was essentially a jazz cut. Actually when you hear the outtakes most of the Stones albums don't feature the best performances, this being the worst example (imagine \\"Some Girls\\" with \\"Claudine\\", etc.). Also left off is a terrific song by Wyman, \\"Shades of Orange\\" (with vocals by Jagger), that would have lifted the album as well. Would that the Glimmer Twins would go back to the sessions and put together a reconstructed \\"Satanic\\", like the recent \\"Let It Be...Naked\\". It has the same place in their catalogue as the original \\"Let\\" did, an album botched in the selection of the material from the sessions with some jewels captured all the same. In the end, Jagger and Keith were just too cynical, too much crust on their uppers to do more than dally with psychedelia, which requires a childlike (and drug induced) sense of hope to sustain, as well as major chops. Jimi Hendrix managed to combine that with grit, but few others ever did. NOTE: given the mono mix by a friend, all my objections to the LP disappeared. It's not the same lp. As with the Beatles LPs of the period, mono was the preferred format as most US kids and UK customers had mono systems so more care was taken with the mono versions (Columbia issues were different, literally separate versionswere recorded by the likes of Dylan and Streisand). You want to hear the \\"SM\\" of your dreams? Pressure the industry to release the mono version.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Stop-motion animation was invented long before movies learned to talk.  In the mid-1920s Willis O'Brien became the first great master of the form, and in 1925 THE LOST WORLD became the first feature-length film to display it.  The film was a sensation, but the stop-motion process was  laborious and extremely expensive.  The early 1930s found O'Brien at RKO, where he worked on a stop-motion film tentatively titled CREATION.  As the Great Depression deepened, however, studio executives became increasingly wary of the cost involved and ultimately canceled the project.<br /><br />This would have likely been the end of O'Brien's career--but for a quirk of fate.  Production partners Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, famous for such exotic films as GRASS, CHANG, and THE FOUR FEATHERS, had arrived at the studio, and Cooper had a fantasy project: a movie about a gorillas.  When Cooper saw O'Brien's footage for the scuttled CREATION, he had a brainstorm that would become one of the most celebrated films of the decade: KING KONG.<br /><br />Much of KING KONG's fascination arises from O'Brien's stop-motion animation process.  At the time, it was the only way in which a film such as KING KONG could be realized, and the frame-by-frame animation process is \\"hand made\\" in a classic sense; adding to this fascination are the models themselves, beautifully rendered, and the miniature sets they inhabited.  But KING KONG would go quiet a bit further than stop-motion; it was made with considerable technical creativity, a film of rising technology that utilized everything from rear-projection to in-camera processes to laboratory techniques.  It captures a sort of critical mass in state of the art of its era.<br /><br />1933 audiences reacted to the film with amazement--and much may be said for contemporary audiences, albeit for considerably different reasons.  Where 1933 audiences found the film frightening real, modern viewers are stunned by the meticulous detail of its pre-digital accomplishment.  But if KING KONG were only a window on past cinematic technology, it would not be as widely embraced today as it is.<br /><br />The film has considerable merit in its directness, its pace, its score, its cast, its script, and the way in which the overall setting for O'Brien's stop-motion animation operates.  It has tremendous charm, a strangely innocent quality, and it deals in archetypes that boil in our culture as powerfully today as they did more than seventy years ago.  But most particularly, O'Brien and his artists and technicians succeed in endowing Kong with personality, and even today we relate to Kong in an emotional way.<br /><br />The recent double disk \\"collector's tin\\" package as a great deal going for it.  KING KONG is one of the most frequently censored films in Hollywood history, with bits removed in virtually every re-release.  With the exception of the \\"Spider Pit\\" sequence, which is likely forever lost, these cuts have been restored, and the quality of the restored cuts is as fine as the quality of the picture as a whole, something not always the case in previous video tape releases.  As for the visual quality of the release, it is quite fine indeed, easily the best I have seen.  Some complain that the sound has not been bumped into stereo, but I have no complaints on this point; KING KONG was filmed before the advent of stereo recording, and we hear it here very much as audiences heard it in 1933.<br /><br />The \\"collectors tin\\" is quite nice and the various paper items are enjoyable, but the bonus DVD material is of mixed quality.  Two documentaries are available, and both \\"I'm King Kong!: The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper\\" and \\"RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World\\" are quite good.  I found the latter particularly interesting inasmuch as it demonstrates how difficult modern film makers found it to reproduce the stop-motion animation process used in the 1933 film.  Peter Jackson, director of the 2005 remake, also spearheads a recreation of the lost \\"Spider Pit\\" sequence to extremely interesting effect, and stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen offers commentary on the surviving and very interesting snip of the aborted CREATION.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the audio commentary is chiefly remarkable for being utterly dismal.  Archival comments by Merian C. Cooper are interesting, but Ken Ralston clearly has only very superficial knowledge of the film and effectively leads Ray Harryhausen away from making any interesting remarks of his own.  As for archival comments by Fay Wray, you'll have to pay very close attention to catch them; they are so short and so insignificant that it seems likely the producers of this package included them only in order to put her name in the commentary line-up.<br /><br />This seems a tremendous pity, for Wray gave numerous interviews over the years concerning KING KONG; it is an opportunity missed.

Archival comments by Merian C. Cooper are interesting, but Ken Ralston clearly has only very superficial knowledge of the film and effectively leads Ray Harryhausen away from making any interesting remarks of his own.  As for archival comments by Fay Wray, you'll have to pay very close attention to catch them; they are so short and so insignificant that it seems likely the producers of this package included them only in order to put her name in the commentary line-up. <br /> <br />This seems a tremendous pity, for Wray gave numerous interviews over the years concerning KING KONG; it is an opportunity missed.

2266083082|5.0|Les Miserables is such a classic that one has the impression of already having read it, or seen it in one's mind, perhaps with Michel Bouquet in the role of Javert, or Gerard Depardieu.  To read Les Miserables, published by Victor Hugo in 1862, offers the pleasure of recognition and a fresh beginning. Always one is carried away by the tension of this book, its unforgettable characters, is use of language--let us not forget that Hugo was the first to introduce slang and popular language into written French--its story and its time.  The unhappy tale of Jean Valjean, from its progressive redemption, disastrous childhood of Cosette to the idylle with Marius, from the sacrificial figure of Fantine to the sinister characters of Thnardier and Javert, the novel is a beautiful lesson of humanity. \\"I come to destroy human fate,\\" wrote Hugo, \\"I condemn slavery, I drive out misery, I inform ignorance, I treat the disease, I light the night, I hate hatred. This is what I am and for this reason I wrote Les Miserables.\\"    (...)
B0009RJPC8|5.0|James Blunt is definately a winner. If you take a couple of easy listening songs, and back them with the vocals of James, it's pretty good. From this album, I think the first 5 songs are definately the best, but they are all great. Back To Bedlam has already sold over 2 million copies alone in the U.K., which is HARD TO ACHIEVE! It has also sold over 1 million in the U.S.    1- High- 5/5  2- You're Beautiful- 5/5  3- Wisemen- 5/5  4- Goodbye My Lover- 5/5  5- Tears & Rain- 5/5  6- Outta My Mind- 5/5  7- So Long Jimmy- 5/5  8- Billy- 5/5  9- Cry- 5/5 (my favourite)  10- No Bravery- 4/5 (just not as good as the other tracks...)    Overall- 5/5. Recommended. End of.    Also recommended: Daniel Powter!!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|This album rocks.  Every song is awesome.  The man can sing.
B00003CWPR|5.0|The movie is about the destruction of Bill's reality, and showing a real world of ambiguity - one in which he is ambivalent - where the women are able to transverse.  Continually, it is the breakdown of the doctor/master mentality, where he is isolating his wife due to his lack of grasp on reality, into a reversal where he relies on the woman to help him through this new world where fear and desire are one.<br /><br />To Kubrick, art is disturbing.  While normal film might shake you up, it brings you back to comfort and reassures your values.  Kubrick shakes you up, threatens you, and then leaves you there.  He wants to force the audience to think, instead of being lead into a pre-planned emotion or thought.

B00005UJOK|4.0|This is Black Sabbath's most popular album and rightly so.  The band that spawned countless imitators like Soundgarden and heck virtually every other heavy metal band that ever was shows just how it's supposed to be done in this album.  From the brilliant intro of \\"War Pigs\\" to the great finale of \\"Fairies Wear Boots,\\" this album just flows along very well and is a classic.  My favourite track is \\"Iron Man\\" with it's great guitar riffing and improvised pentatonic solo break in the middle, it's just THE classic heavy metal track.  Now the album comes remastered in a really cool mini-lp replica sleeve.  The only problem is that the master tapes must have really deteriorated as despite a very valiant remastering attempt, some tracks sound better than others but having heard the normal un-remastered version, I can tell you that this version is still light years better.  This is the best version of the album that's out there for fans old and new alike.  Recommended!
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Upon initially hearing \\"See You On The Other Side\\" this reviewer wasn't sure exactly what to make of it. It was not a bad album by any stretch, though I felt it was - to a certain extent - a bit disappointing and frustrating. Back then, it was my belief that, after the departure of lead guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch the year before, Korn were a bit strapped for ideas, and had to scramble to come up with songwriting ideas. They were blatantly abandoning their roots, and not even making an attempt at the same heaviness that was heard on, say, `03's \\"Take A Look In The Mirror.\\" Plus, yours truly didn't find it to be as catchy, either.<br /><br />However, the key word here is \\"initially\\"...because now the above opinion could not be further from the truth. Confession time: Korn is among my all-time favorite bands, yet I didn't really give this 2005 effort the fair shake that it deserves. It would be safe to say that I had a prematurely made-up opinion about it. In my defense, this task was easy to do, when considering the new album's experimentalism was a total surprise, making it likely to leave many fans cold after the first couple listens. But sure you mark my words, when I say this: I officially retract my last review (a long, long overdue statement)! Reading between the lines, this is the kind of record that grows on you. And grows, and grows, and grows...and grows! In fact, it may never - or at least rarely - cease growing in appreciation. Yes, the new material is bound to sound different. Hence, one might think that the band are afraid of riffing, and that their rhythm section sounds a bit weakened. These things are simply not the case, though. Instead, look at it this way: Upped levels of creativity, breaking new ground, breadth, and epic-ness. Anyone can out-heavy themselves, but John Davis & the Gang opt for good songwriting (among other things).<br /><br />As aforementioned, \\"SYOTOS\\" does possess more-than-a-few experimental elements. But cool your jets, because it does not have too many. Furthermore, I hope I have not mislead you into thinking that it has absolutely nothing that sounds familiar - because it does. With repeat listens it becomes increasingly clear that numerous heavy riffs still remain in tact, here (really, they do!). Thus, the songs capture an almost perfect balance between innovation and the raw, mean angst of old. As a result, the experimental aspect stops well-short of the \\"selling-out\\" point; it makes the songs boast great texture, unpredictability and soft-hard friction. Also, it is a necessity to say something about its accessibility. True, the new material is less immediately catchy than fans are used to, but fear not because the songs do bristle with memorable hooks. The only difference now is that Korn have developed a surprisingly smooth and subtle way of delivering them (a surefire sign of maturity). In other words, as was the case with the guitar riffs, the hooks are still there, and they are as prominent as ever, even if they might take a little extra time to appreciate. And once they have sunk in, it should only be a matter of time before you are headbanging just like you used to, with John's lyrics/vocals tattooed to your brain, and mimicking David Silveria's crashing (and frequently reverberating and tmospheric) percussion on air-drums. Heck, one might even him/herself humming a tune the rest of the afternoon.<br />\\"Twisted Transistor\\" is an insanely hooky, infectious, and addictive opener. Trippy, Eighties-era transistor-like sound effects, rhythms that are as ready for the dance-floor as you can get, nice vocal hooks, Davis' usual gross lyrics (this time they are about a girl who falls in love with her radioy...it's all here, and is enough to make it easily one of the best singles in Korn's discography. \\"Politix,\\" with its climactic, angry choruses and near deathly growls, sees the group entering a bit heavier territory; as does \\"Hypocrites,\\" which is complete with really memorable vocal patterns (including a bit of near-rapping, and shout-worthy refrains), and some of Munky's strongest rifffing to date. (It has chunky, memorable, and at times near-funky-sounding guitar licks from beginning to end.) \\"Souvenir\\" is another very catchy number. It finds Davis summoning higher, near-falsetto notes over Tom Morello-style keyboard-sounding guitars.<br /><br />A heavy Marilyn Manson influences shines through sporadically. In fact, it would not be unfair to say that some tracks, like  \\"10 Or A 2 Way\\" and its successor, \\"Throw Me Away,\\" are so industrial-lite that they could have almost been lifted wholesale off of a MM outing. Two other standouts, \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Coming Undone,\\" feature perhaps the most memorable choruses of the bunch. The latter is also of note for its terrifically toe-tap-able, Nine Inch Nails/Rammstein-esque stomp-and-clap rhythm. \\"Liar\\" again delves onto the more aggressive side of things, thanks to the plenty of rhythmic, industrial-strength, staccato power cords sprinkled on here-and-there throughout. Lastly of note is the set's pinnacle (and closer). \\"Tearjerker\\" is almost startling in its tunefulness; Davis digs deep and comes up with a truly breathtaking and soulful bit of accomplished clean singing. \\"Tearjerker\\"'s lyrics aren't anything to write home about, but still - it does deserve credit for being an excellent, very atmospheric, pretty, and soaring power ballad. And it proves JD has has a surprisingly good vocal range because he can actually sing!<br /><br />Whether or not Korn can pull-through on their own without the assistance of Brian \\"Head\\" Welche remains to be seen. But this is a fact: \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is definitely a big step in the right direction. Overall, the affair manages to sound both new/different while simultaneously being a bit familiar. So, in short, both new and old fans of the band should find something worth their while in \\"See You.\\" And upon hearing it, both parties should attest that it is pretty-darn-great!l patterns (including a bit of near-rapping, and shout-worthy refrains), and some of Munky's strongest rifffing to date.

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Well I just got finished listening to S.Y.O.T.O.S., Korn's 7th album and I must say Korn has still got it.  They may have lost Head, but in a way that is better because now it's Munky's turn to shine!   <br /> <br />The tracks are different from their previous cds.  They might sway some older fans, but I personally love it, and i've been down with Korn since '94.  I don't even want to pick specific songs because they are all good but I have to give a little push to \\"Tearjerker\\".  That song is amazing, and just because their are \\"next to no drums\\" or \\"jon sounds whiny\\"...i think that's the whole point.  Hence the name \\"Tearjerker\\"!   <br /> <br />The bonus disc is great as well.  The first 3 tracks, in my opinion should have been on the standard cd!  All 3 tracks are amazing!  \\"It's Me Again\\" is a close favorite! <br /> <br />If your ready for a new kind of Korn, then pick this up!  It's definetely worth it! <br /> <br />Oh and Korn aren't dead!
B00005JNZJ|3.0|I was drawn to seeing Aeon Flux, because the trailer provided a few impressive action scenes and I am very interested in seeing the participations of three Oscar-nominated/winning actresses teaming up in this Sci-fi action \\"chick flick\\". I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.<br /><br />Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....<br /><br />This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.use he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mimi has obviously lost the plot, as her record label has just released the following statement regarding the Diamond deluxe edition of this album: 'Whilst we cannot reveal exact details regarding the new edition of Mimi, what we can reveal is that Mariah is working hard on making this release extra special  for her fans, as a sort of thank-you for their loyalty and support to her'. <br /> <br />If Mimi thinks she is thanking her fans by making them cough up for another edition of this trashy album, then she needs to be locked up in some cave somewhere.
B000002BSG|5.0|This was the first Jamiroquai album that I heard and I fell immediately in love with it.  It was obvious from the first few tracks that I was listening to a future classic album.  Great track after great track and the hit singles are not even the best tracks!  My favourites are the bonus track, the title track, \\"Alright\\" and \\"You Are My Love.\\"  Jamiroquai have still to even come close to the quality of this album on any of their follow ups.  The sound quality of the recording is also very good and the cd booklet has all the lyrics as well.  Highly recommended for all acid jazz fans.  As a fan of the old Stevie Wonder stuff myself, I'm stumped when people compare the two.  The voices may sound a little similar but their vocal stylings and delivery are very different; in fact, I'm convinced no one sounds like Jamiroquai just as no one sounds like Stevie Wonder!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|For the DVD special edition, what's surprising is what's missing from the package, and this is what I find galling in our current atmosphere of overly produced DVD extras (often the films take less time than the documentary extras!  got a week to watch a DVD package for any Lord of the Rings film?)  In this case, namely the old-hollywood style screentest of leading lady Emmy Rostum and also the informal (he already had the job)presentation of Patrick's Wilson's vocal ability to the composer.  Only snippets are included in this package on the documentary of the making of the film.  This hurts the overall package, as does the lack of releasing to the audience more of the filming of the score and our actors singing their parts for the soundtrack in the recording studio.  Was this not to see the struggles with lead phantom?  The extras and also the casting of the phantom himself are why the DVD gets a 4 star rating from me.  The phantom is suitably virile and threatening and I have no problem with him in the part physically, but the lack of vocal ability of this performer - though he's rough-edged, this phantom, they could have hired a rough-edged though on-key singer (such as a new Roger Daltry) - makes for several cringing moments.  It's such a breath of fresh air for the listener when we're back to the professionals of Emmy R & Patrick W, who are the romantic leads.  They sing with such ease, every note is truly like an additional breath to them, it makes the audience even more aware of how the phantom is straining valiantly to keep his end up, and sometimes losing the battle.  A psychological preparation for how the phantom loses out to the smooth hero in the end? Regarding the film itself, I think it's achieved it's purpose of being an old-fashioned, though rock music oriented, beautiful vision.  It is, in fact, one of the more beautiful films to watch, so as eye-candy it fulfills it's obligations in the set design, costumes, cinematography and the two male leads.One can clearly see the influence of the director's earlier film LOST BOYS in the night scenes and the lair of this phantom.  For Emmy Rostum, this will probably be the highlight of her career, featuring her spirit and her voice and professionalism.  It's hard to top this heroine for a role!  For Patrick Wilson, he was already a lead actor/star in Broadway musicals and as a dramatic actor in the prestigious production of ANGELS IN AMERICA, so this is probably just a continuation of his singular step up the ladder.

We need the likes of artists like Patti Smith more than ever because she motivates a greater desire for REAL passion as expressed so urgently in \\"Land\\".   Her poetry can be described by a great line in the movie \\"Ghost Dog\\" as \\"the poetry of war\\" - but a war for self-expression in a judgementless society.  Bring it on before it's gone!

As simple as that! We'll, that's what's not so simple is it. Could you do it? You've got the whole movie to think about it!!! <br />Danny Glover, Cary Elws and Monica Potter star in this low budget, but spectacular and exceptionally clever film.  <br />Elwes is chained up in a dark bathroom with a stranger and has to work out how to get out in order to save his family!!! The two are played against each other in a series of games in order to get the one to do the unthinkable. The story reveals that neither of them are in fact total strangers nor are they both entirely innocent.  <br />Written and Directed by first time \\"nobodies\\" - LEIGH WHANNELL & JAMES WAN : who believe me after this are going somewhere. Names will be in bright lights soon!  <br />JIGSAW is the warped psychopath pitting everyday people against the impossible in order to survive! Chances of making it - very slim unless you do what you'd never even dream of attempting. <br />The film is very unsettling and most will battle to sit through it... but I highly recommend seeing it.  <br />It really is a MASTERPIECE and hopefully the already highly talked about sequel will keep the same pace and same originality and not conform to the basic sequel rules that turn so much of the garbage we see these days into the quickly forgotten. This one will haunt you for a while. <br />Oh, and please hold on for the ending. It'll take your breath away!!!    <br />

B000BJS4OY|5.0|I'll assume that you already know the music.  The remix provided no great revelation (did anyone ever say, \\"I like Born to Run, but if it were mixed better it might really be something special\\"?)  However, this entire set may be seen as an opportunity to embrace the work in a new light, or at least, at a new time in your life.  And it turns out that the songs you know by heart are truly great.  We learn from the \\"Wings for Wheels\\" video that Bruce was looking to make sweeping, cinematic songs, and of course he succeeded in spades; the piano introductions that mark most of these songs serve to set the mood in a very cinematic, dramatic way.  \\"Thunder Road\\" is an invocation, and thus it appears first on the record; the opening is, as Bruce said on the recent Behind the Music, an invitation.  And we go along for the ride, and it is spectacular.  Think of the way \\"Jungleland\\" opens, the violin and piano; the scene perfectly set.<br /><br />\\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,\\" \\"Night\\" \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"She's the One\\" are stone cold classics that still raise the hair on your arms when he plays them live, and will when you listen again here; \\"Meeting Across the River\\" ages far better than we might have thought. \\"Born to Run\\" is one of the 10 greatest rock'n'roll songs ever written.  For me, though, the one song that benefits most from a fresh listen is \\"Jungleland.\\"  Sweeping in its grandeur, over 9 minutes long, and the culmination of the story songwriting Bruce began on his first two albums.  The vocalizing he does after the final, whispered \\"Tonight... in... jungle... land...\\" may be one of the greatest rock vocal performances ever.  He says it all in those closing moments, without saying a thing.<br /><br />Watch the documentary first; it provides an informative window into the creative process, and places the Born to Run record in historical context.  Then listen to the album.  Then play the concert DVD.  At the time, this was thought to have been a disappointing performance by the E Street Band, but the proof is there on the tapes.  This is an opportunity to see one of the great live rock'n'roll bands of all time, unchallenged, at THE quintessential time in their evolution.  It is the first tour with the classic Born to Run line-up: Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan actually joined the band during the recording sessions, as did Miami Steve, who isn't even on the album.  This is Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as they live in your mind's eye: skinny, scraggly, unkempt; big hats, bonded together with a whole lot to prove, and intent on proving it (all night) at any cost.  The sheer thrill of youth and rock'n'roll and \\"making it\\" has maybe never been captured so succintly before.  These are moments you can never recreate; maybe these musicians are more skilled now, but they will never be 25 years old with everything on the line again.  The hair on your arms WILL stand up when you watch this concert, and you will experience a rock'n'roll epiphany, a little taste of old time religion and redemption delivered with piano, glockenspiel, Fender telecaster and brassy sax.and, but the proof is there on the tapes.

B00008EY9G|5.0|It's incredible how many movies come out and get buried away to quickly... like this one. Not much \\"HOOPLA\\" about it... didn't see too much advertising... and so the only reason I actually saw it, was a relative brought it back from the States and gave it to me as a gift. <br />One word : HECTIC!  <br />Great cast (John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, et al) all get intertwined in a story that just keeps you guessing and pointing fingers.  <br />The setting (your basic horror/thriller ingredients), a dark and stormy night, plenty of rain and a group of strangers get stuck together at a creepy motel. <br />One by one the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" start dissapearing... and now we have to find out who is responsible...  <br />A nice bit of jumping back and forth from \\"present\\" to \\"past\\" adds to the suspense. <br />Expect a stunning \\"USUAL SUSPECTS\\" style, break-neck twist that comes at you out of nowhere!  <br />John Cusack has also always been one of those hugely dependable and under-rated actors and he is superb in this... as is Ray Liotta. <br />DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I'VE SEEN... GO AND GET IT!!!  <br /> <br />
0312330529|5.0|Was in Sydney and walked into a small bookstore and they recommended this book highly. I had no idea what I started, it was definitely the best thing I have read in a long time. It is vivid, passionate and full of beautiful details that describes a life that we can't even imagine. I highly recommend it! <br />
0689865384|4.0|When a book has a \\"point\\", some kind of after-school special message to send, the story suffers.  A lot.<br /><br />This isn't one of those books.<br /><br />Maybe Scott Westerfield didn't mean for there to be a message, but his writing skills are good enough that it simply doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />In this far-future world, everyone is \\"ugly\\" until the age of 16, when an operation turns them into an idealized \\"pretty\\", appealing to all in an anime-esque version of _Harrison Bergeron_ equality.  Tally is wholly a part of this world, until she's forced into an adventure, blackmailed with her \\"prettyness\\" held hostage until she betrays a friend.<br /><br />Westerfield's ability to write compelling characters continues to shine, creating a believable world with fascinating characters.  It's a testament to his skill that this book - the first in a trilogy - is not his best (hence the 4 stars on my review), but remains far better than most books in the field.  My major gripe (such as it is) is that Tally is a female protagonist.  Not that I have a problem with THAT, but he shares a flaw with Robert Heinlein - his female leads act... well, awfully butch.  Still, if sharing a flaw with Heinlein is the worst you can say, you're doing quite well.  Recommended for teens and up.
B00005JO1J|1.0|It's about a group of ultra-libral, ultra-gay, ultra-poverty, useless, low-lifes who hate everything that doesn't originate from the gutter and believe if everyone just sat around singing Kum-bay-ya and stuck needles in their arms while they have public homosexual sex the world would be a better place........oh, and it's all set to music! <br />  <br />2 1/2 hours of depressing trash....by the end of the movie I was hoping they all would jump off the building that they lived in and never pay RENT ! <br /> <br />
B00005JNZJ|2.0|It is a bad sign indeed when a studio does not allow the critical press to preview a film before its release. This happened with Karyn Kusama's (the extraordinary \\"Girlfight\\") \\"Aeon Flux,\\" a turkey of such proportions as to overwhelm and upturn the largest and sturdiest of Christmas tables.<br />\\"Aeon Flux\\" has many things going for it on paper: Kusama, whose \\"Girlfight\\" was tough, gritty and aggressive, every thing this film is not; the glorious Charlize Theron, the noted cinematographer, Graeme Revell, Sophie Okenedo, Marton Csonkas and the estimable Frances McDormand. But what has come out of all this talent? Not much: \\"Aeon Flux\\" is still born, stilted, lacking anything even approaching style or forward movement. All of the actors, gifted one and all, are given mostly gibberish to spout...they seem lost and consequently so do we.<br />Despite all of this, the film is quite beautiful, looking very much like a 1960's futuristic film like \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" both in production and costume design. \\"F451\\" was released in 1966; surely the film makers could have come up with some new ideas particularly with all the technical improvements that have occurred in the last 40 years?<br />Many films are so bad that they are good: \\"Aeon Flux\\" is not one of these.
B000AARKOO|4.0|There is no doubt that Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR will \\"ECHO IN ETERNITY\\" and that every EPIC he made from the Year 2000 until the day he stops making films will be judged against that AWESOME MOVIE. <br />That was the reason that it took me weeks after it's release on DVD to actually watch \\"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN\\"... and now I wish I'd seen it on the big screen. <br />It's no GLADIATOR - jot that point down right now - but it's still one of the best films of 2005, especially if you are looking for an EPIC, SWEEPING TALE, with large scale battles and picturesque scenery. The ladies will love ORLANDO BLOOMING on the screen, and guys will appreciate the fact that ORLANDO is a bit \\"TOUGHER\\" than he was in TROY. In fact, he really fits the profile of an action hero in this film. He's flanked (even if briefly) by an as-ever impressive LIAM NEESON. <br />The film will impress, of that, you can be guaranteed. A fantastic story of self discovery and courage, and an awesomely spectacular battle scene towards the ending will have you glued to the screen. <br />So, listen to what I say, if you haven't seen it. Pop down to the store, pick it up, and spend 2 hours enjoying the masterful Mr. Scott doing what comes naturally... <br />
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game after playing it one night with friends. It is very fun and challenging when it gets down to the wire. I thought it would be hard for smaller children, but my 6 year old daughter loves playing it with us and loves to \\"block\\" us! It is best played with 3 or 4 people. With 2, you pretty much end with a tie. I highly recommend it!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|If you are a Michael Buble fan like me you will want to add this CD/DVD to your collection.  I can't believe I missed him when he played in Dallas this year.  Bet I won't do that again.  Favorite part of the DVD is the battle of the singers.  If you don't know what I'm talking about buy the CD/DVD.  Very funny stuff.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I was very upset when I read the review of this album that said it was not suitable for Christians. I myself am a Christian and I found this CD to be very honoring to the true meaning of Christmas. Look at songs like \\"Jesus born on this day\\" and \\"Jesus, Oh, What a Wonderful Child\\". This is one of the few Christmas CDs by a pop artist that actually metions Jesus, and Mariah is one of the very few pop artists that actually wrote a song about Christmas being all about Jesus' birth (Jesus, born on this day). To say this CD is not suitable for Christians is most certainly not true. Maybe we should not be so quick to judge people, and really listen to what they are saying. This CD will also appealing to anyone in the mood for good Christmas music and some amazing vocals.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|11 YEARS AGO we were graced with this movie. It will go down as maybe THE greatest \\"buddy-movie\\" / \\"prison film\\" ever made. With narration by one of my favourite actors, MORGAN FREEMAN, and a performance by him that should have won him an OSCAR - partnered with TIM ROBBINS'S magnificent portrayal of a man wrongly convicted - is what makes this work. Not to mention, incredible characters we meet along the way. Attention to detail with costumes, sets and props. Spectacular footage rounds it all off. The prison itself is a character and it actaully comes alive in the film... the doom and gloom of the prison as we fly over it for the first time... makes you feel very uneasy. And as Andy walks through the entrance and stares up - the building almost seems to be staring down at him.  <br />All in all a grity, no holes barred look at prison life (along with the unpleasant truth of prison gang rape), a journey for RED & ANDY that will see them respecting each other and becoming good friends, and a lesson that teaches us : after all is said and done and we really believe we have nothing left... HOPE is all you need - it's what keeps us all alive. \\"GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING!!!\\" BUY IT, WATCH IT, LOVE IT... put it on the shelf and watch it again every 6 months. You never get tired of it...
B0002F6AH0|2.0|The best WW2 series I have seen. <br />Be wary of the DVD set. Besides freezing discs a couple of episodes are repeated in place of the one indicated. Poorly mastered. I sent mine back and purchased the VHS set. I purchased the DVD set early and hopefully the mastering problem has been corrected.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I discovered Michael Buble's music by accident.  I was in a book store and they were playing it.  I ended up walking out with his CD and not the book I was suppose to buy.  I've been a fan ever since.  I don't have many CDs I can say every track is a hit but \\"It's Time\\" is one of those CDs.  I hope this young man has a long singing career.  We need more artists like him who sing from the heart.  His voice is soothing like a cup of hot chocolate on a cold day.  This is a CD to listen to for any time...work, driving, jogging, etc.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn, as most of us know has hit some very hard times in the past few years. Last two albums sold about 1/3 of what Issues did, and, of course, their guitarist Head left to form a christian band.  <br /> <br />But through that, Korn adapted and came out with this very sleek new album. <br /> <br />The good: THE LYRICS! my god the lyrics! We finally get songs that aren't just about how depressed Jonathan is. This trait disapointed me in Untouchables, and was annoying in Mirror. But now we get song that not only have good lyrics, but that are very relevent to the world like 'Politics' and Hypocrite.  <br /> <br />The music and production on here is very tight. Every member is heard clearly and is in perfect balance. There isn't the fast click on fieldy's bass here, instead he focused more on long groove riffs.  <br /> <br />The Bad: Just two little problems I had. First, all the songs are still structured in the verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge chorus formula. Not that it alone makes a song bad because so many bands do it, but on a seventh album it wouldn't have been a bad idea to change that up a bit. The second problem is on the cd when korn tries to blend their old style with their new one on songs like Souvenir and Getting off. These songs I feel are the weakest on the cd, and mostly because when they try to blend aggression with all that slick production they just come off sounding very weak.  <br /> <br />Another very weird trait of the cd is the interludes. Instead of making them sepereate tracks, Korn used them as endings to four sonds on here. For two songs it sounds really good, but for the other two... might make it better for some and ruin it for others. All the interlude endings are made from bagpipes. <br /> <br />Here is a track run though. <br /> <br />Twisted Transistor: An unusual and experimental song. Starts off with it playing backwards and then fad's into the song playing how it should be. This song is very groovy, has fun lyrics, and just sounds great on the cd. The only problem with the song is that it hasn't been transfering well live. This is the first single from the album and has a very funny video with rap stars playing Korn.  <br /> <br />Politics: A song about corruption and greed. I love the lyrics here. And the bridge sounds wonderful. This is a song that will sound great live to. <br /> <br />Hypocrite: A song about religion. A lot of symbolic lyrics that ultimatly revolve around the bad effects religion has on people. Another song that Korn have been playing live in every show so far and also sounds great. The guitar here is more rock oriented. <br /> <br />Souvenir: The first weak song of the cd.  <br /> <br />10 or a 2 way: A groovy 80's style opening and then goes into a double layered Chorus as Jonathan sings about a lost love. This is the first song to have an interlud end it. The best way I can describe it is Darth Vader on Bag Pipes. The bridge in this song is the same chorus build-up that it is in the B-side Last legal drug. Which is probably why that cd was put on the bonus disk. <br /> <br />Throw me Away: A ballad-like song. This is the best sounding song on the cd so far. It has very long and emotional vocals from Jonathan, and soft industrial influenced music in the background. This is the best song on the cd to this point. I'd describe it as what the new NIN cd should have sounded like. <br /> <br />Love song: A eulogy of a song. The lyrics in the chorus are really good, but they tend to get thrown off by the verses. In the bridge it is just Jonathan singing alone which sounds really good and the final chorus has back up vocals that add an extra kick to the song. I dont like the intro but it's a very good song overall. <br /> <br />Open up: A long soft song, and from the lyrics I think it's about head. Another very good song from the cd, and has some groovy bass by fieldy. This one also has in interlude ending, it's some distorted bag pipes mixed in with distorted scat vocals.And in the background are bass piano chords.  <br /> <br />Coming Undone: VERY experimental track. All through the song there is a clapping sound like it's comming from a hip hop song. It's a very smooth song with Jonathan lining up perfectly with the music. Very nice dance song. <br /> <br />Getting off: Another weak track I think, but the only the second one so far. <br /> <br />Liar: This one is distinguished for having scat vocals. But I feel they are forced in this song, and i'm just not feeling the bag pipe ending. The intro to this song is very cool, but that's it. <br /> <br />For no one: A fun sounding song before the last two songs. It begins with Jon singing with a small distortion on his voice, then goes into a double layered chorus. A solid osng. <br /> <br />Seen it All: My favorite from this cd. A slow, dark song, with another bridge with just him singing. And the breakdown after it is great. This song also has the best interlude ending. Beautiful song. <br /> <br />Tearjerker: A soft 5 minute song. Not a bad song, but I just can't get into it.  <br /> <br />So there you have it, overall there are only four songs I dont like, and ten that are solid. There were also five B-sides released for this cd.  <br /> <br />It's me again: Korn's old style, blunt lyrics, short and loud. <br /> <br />Eaten up inside: A distorted industrial song. Not bad, but really only good to give you a taste of the new cd. The guitar is really good in it though. <br /> <br />Last legal Drug: A song about Love being the last legal drug. Probably kicked off because the lyrics clash with 10 or a 2 way. A slow atmospheric song, but the only part I like is when he says 'love might be the last legal drug' <br /> <br />Appears: A very groovy rock song. My favorite B-side, too bad it's only 3 minutes. <br /> <br />Too late I'm dead: The other B-side I like, a crazy little three minute song.
0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold's brutal account of the rape that shattered her world was disturbing, heart-wrenching and sometimes difficult to read. The way in which she triumphed over this horrific, life-altering event and her attacker is magnificent, inspiring and truly praise-worthy. Though some details may be difficult to swallow, you simply must read this book.
0060899190|1.0|I was sooooo disappointed with this book.  <br /> <br />I decided to order this because I was under the impression that these would be secrets that I hadn't seen before. Upon discovering that I had allready seen almost all of them on the website at some point, I felt totally jipped.  I mean, I could've just PRINTED them out, stapled them together and saved a few bucks. <br /> <br />*sigh* So yeah, if you think that by ordering this book you're going to get to view a bunch of never before seen post cards, think again... <br /> <br />And what kills me, is that if the author has received over 10,000 post cards to date, you'd think it wouldn't have been that difficult for him to dig up some new material that he hasn't posted on the website. <br /> <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Its hard to believe almost 40 years have passed since there \\"farewell\\" concert, but here they are. Yes, they are a little older, and yes they look different.  But SO WHAT.<br /><br />It drives me nuts to hear this generation say if you are over 40 you can't rock and roll. Conversely, if that was true, they would be listening to NSYNC Britney all day.<br /><br />This a great DVD and CD set. What is amazing is that they played with bare electronics. No fancy computer driven this and that, just their instruments and such. They played killer rhythm and blues, (Politician...WOW), just these three and there instuments, the way they were meant to be played. No computer driven sound affects or alterations to make them \\"different\\" or hide flaws, as they do now.<br /><br />People forget what bands used to really sound like, as they stood on stage naked to the world playing their music. This is one example. This is a five star set, and is well worth the cost.<br /><br />Not bad for old timers. Even at their age, they beat many of today's.  How many of todays bands, formed in the 2000's, will perform together 40 years from now? Not many.<br /><br />PS A good companion is their farewell concert (circa 68-69).
0393317552|3.0|I'll leave Diamond's arguments for other reviewers (though I will say that I think his ideas make sense in light of the evidence he presents.) As far as the book itself goes I'll say that I really tried to like it but struggled to do so. I usually love books like this that tackle these big questions but found \\"Guns\\" to be a bit boring and long-winded. The writing didn't flow well and his point was sometimes hazy.  I won't argue with the Pulitzer Prize award - the book is certainly exhaustive in its breadth and depth but it just left me a bit cold. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic but for a good read I'd look elsewhere.
015603008X|5.0|i happened upon this book while combing through the isles of barnes & nobles and boy am i happy that i bought it. The story of mentally-retarded Charlie and his white mouse counterpart Algernon is brilliantly executed as the author manages to bring a highly hypothetical issue to fruition in the reader's mind. This novel is a modern classic that will raise many ethical, moral and social questions and will definitely lead the reader to question his attitude towards those seen as 'slow' or 'different'. A brilliant read.
B000B0WO0I|4.0|As it's called, Simplified presents some of Simply Red's biggest hits in a simplified, stripped down manner: with some simple sax / piano / violin and some jazzed up vocals / backing vocals. <br /> <br />My favourite tracks on this album are \\"For Your Babies\\" and \\"Your Mirror\\" - not surprising as not only are these two songs taken from my favourite Simply Red album, Stars, but also because they're so basic, with just the piano and Mick Hucknall's soulful voice. <br /> <br />Some other stand-out tracks are \\"Fairground\\", \\"Something's Got Me Started\\" (which has a very interesting Latin sound to it!) and \\"Holding Back The Years\\". Not forgetting there is a new track on here called \\"Perfect Love\\", presented in two versions. My biggest complaint is why wasn't \\"Stars\\" included here? I would have simply loved listening to a simplified version of \\"Stars\\"! <br /> <br />For a soundtrack to long drives in the country to lounging on the sofa with a wine glass in hand, this is a great album to unwind to. Buy it!
B000BPCCZA|5.0|The second half is here finally. SOAD's \\"Hypnotize\\" is pure marketing genius. Who would of \\"thunk it\\" by splitting this two CD set and selling each half at separate times? I think the ultimate plan came out of the recording sessions by the band.<br /><br />\\"Hypnotize\\" DualDisc is worth the price of admission. There is a big difference on the enhanced stereo sound of the DVD. The songs tend to jump out and clarify. I really didn't know there was a difference until I played it in my home digital surround sound system. Awesome clarity! I first played the CD side in my trucks system and thought it was a great sound. But after the home system sound was revealed how could I ever play this CD side again. As a bonus the artwork of both albums are revealed when playing the DVD songs.<br /><br />The DVD contains a behind the scenes of the making of both \\"Mezmerize\\" and \\"Hypnotize.\\" This one was perplexing because of the quality of the scenes shot. The scenes were of fuzzy and hidden like camera angles? It was like when you first got a digital camera and was shooting the different styles of filters. That was difficult to watch. But the interaction with the band was priceless. They are discussing the lyrics and meaning of the songs. The \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Question!\\" videos are awesome on a digital player.<br /><br />Okay, the songs of \\"Hypnotize.\\" SOAD starts the \\"Attack\\" on the first track. Then into \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Kill Rock N Roll\\" and \\"Hypnotize.\\" All of these are consistent with SOAD's sound. The expermention still exists with \\"Stealing Society\\", \\"Tentative\\", \\"U-Fig\\" and \\"Holy Mountains.\\" The bizarre \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" and the drug related song \\"She's Like Heroin.\\" Then it is time to chill with a slower pace with the relatable \\"Lonely Day\\" and the long awaited complete \\"Soldier Side\\" ends \\"Hypnotize\\" but starts \\"Mezmerize.\\" This is a vintage SOAD CD.<br /><br />SOAD's DualDisc was worth the extra price because of the enhanced stereo sound. But I shopped around and got a price well below the CD only price.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|So i read the reviews. All these people talking about a new guitar hero....blah blah blah. Well ..i picked up this CD , EXPECTING a guitar hero. Hmmmm, I thought , as I listened. This sounds not as much like a guitar hero to me, as much as it sounded like someone who people have HYPED to be a guitar hero , but in acutality was nothing of the sort. He's good dont get me wrong, but a guitar hero he is not. The playing was nothing i havent heard before. It didnt stand out to me as being particularly virtuosic. Eh...call me crazy, but i have heard much better and I simply didnt buy the hype.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I would really like the person who said David Gilmour is not a spectacular guitarist, lyricist and singer to really rethink how much they actually enjoy music.  Secondly, David Gilmour was invited to join the band by Syd Barrett, a long time friend. Syd made one album with the band so dont act all cool by saying Syd was the best. It doesnt work. As for Roger, well he is and excellent singer/songwriter but he chose to leave the band.  This DVD has been a long time coming and I think we all should be happy that its almost here.
0739316478|5.0|Grisham can do any type of book he wants.  He proved this with \\"Bleachers\\" and \\"A Painted House\\" and he does it again with \\"The Broker.\\"  Although a money-grubbing lawyer is the protagionist, this story's connection with the law ends there.  Instead you get a thrilling story where you don't know what's going to happen next.  The story gets significant highlight through the setting of Bologna, Italy, which is almost a character of its own (not quite to the level of a Savannah, GA, however, in \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\".)  Readers are going to learn quite a bit about the wonderful Italian culture, so travellers to Northern Italy would do well to read this book in preparation.  Ordering cappuchino in the afternoon and evening got a friend of mine laughed at in Italy, so this and other tips are included here.<br /><br />Michael Beck is a great narrator for Grisham novels.  He did \\"The Summons\\" wonderfully and turns in another great performance on the audiobook version.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially for those interested in a change of pace from gadgetry-focused espionage stories, as well as those interested in Italy.
B000294SFW|5.0|This album rocks and rocks hard!!! Sounds like the old Motorhead and better! <br /> <br />If you haven't ever heard a true heavy band that's for real and truly displaying that on an album, Inferno is the one you should listen to.  <br /> <br />Motorhead Forever!!!
0451169514|5.0|King doesn't just sit down and try to write a scary novel with neat ending. He hits you in the place where your fear is, and he pulls it to the surface. <br />This is one of the few books that really scared me. Definitely a must-read for fans of either King or the horror genre.
B00097DX3U|5.0|audioslave have done it again with out of exile. they seem to have a more tight line up of songs than last time around, even though i thought the first album was great and didnt have any weak songs,it didnt flow together like album, more like a bunch of good songs. on out of exile, they have an album, an album of great songs that all have there own sound and can stand out on there own, this is a big step foward for them    your time has come5/5 great song, doznt quite have the same bang as cochise did, but its still a great song, and a good album starter    out of exile4/5 a good song, with a very cool intro, chris wrote it about his wife vicky    be yourself5/5 awesome! just awesome, i use to not like this song as much, but now i love it, one of my favortie audioslave songs    dosent remind me4/5 this song is pretty damn good, great lyrics, and the guitar solo is fantastic      drown me slowly5/5 i give this 5/5 for the bass line during the verse is just awesome, and gos great with the guitar parts    heavens dead5/5 great song, this really shows where there going with geting there own sound    the worm4/5 this is a funny song, i think they were drunk when they recorded this, at least thats what chris said    man or animal4/5 really good song, really heavy, and the guitar solo is insane    yesterday to tomorrow5/5 this again shows where there going, the bass line reminds me of sweet emotion by aerosmith    dandelion4/5 my least favorite on the album, i still like it though, nice riff, and good vocals from chris cornell    #1 zero5/5 this is an awesome song, the bass and guitar work in here are some of the best on the album and again good vocals from cornell    the cursse5/5 a good song, good way to end the album, good lyrics from cornell, great guitar work from tom, the solo just rules!!!
B000002ITW|5.0|As I have stated in other reviews, 4 WAY STREET along with STICKY FINGERS made the soundtrack to the summer of 1971.  I listened to it over and over and when I left home for college in late summer I discovered thousands of others were doing the very same thing.  Its influence cannot be overstated.  Both the earlier CROSBY STILL & NASH and D&Eacute;J&Agrave; VU were critical and popular successes; but this live album filled out the legend and presented CSNY as the band has remained in memory and imagination.<br /><br />Many of my contemporaries hate this album.  John Mellencamp has gone on record stating it is the worst record in the world.  While this is unduly harsh, there is a grain of truth to one complaint.  4 WAY STREET is very much an artifact of its time.  It was made in the shadow of social upheaval that included racial riots, assassinations, disturbances at several hundred colleges and universities, the divisive Vietnam War, and the \\"massacre\\" four protesting students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard.  It was a threatening and politically charged time.  And CSNY were at the forefront of what was then called the youth counter-culture.<br /><br />They were part of 1960's generation who believed they glimpsed a better moral code and way of life different the older generations before them.  Outside of this context, some of what CSNY has to say makes little sense.  For some this is precisely the trouble.  All those events of the late 1960's-early 1970's are now only dry words in history books.  Of larger import to the youth of that time, the next few years revealed that the long expected \\"Age of Aquarius\\" and the promise of new enlightenment and idealism would not come.  That special, bright, shinning hope died.<br /><br />If everything CSNY did were topical, then there would be little here of interest.  With the exception of Graham Nash's \\"Chicago\\", Stills' \\"America's Children\\" rant and perhaps Young's \\"Ohio\\", CSNY's music was not so political that it retains little musical interest.  True to Crosby's short monologue before \\"Triad\\", they mostly focused on what was going on in their lives and the lives of those around them.  And the fact that they were so musically inventive and entertaining still inspires enthusiasm today.<br /><br />What had struck many was the album's unique (for its time) format of one disc acoustic and the other disc electric.  What is really interesting is that, of the twenty full songs, only five came the groups' earlier two albums.  The rest of the material came from their earlier bands or from their solo work.  The moment's focus moves from member to member as they traded off between each other doing each other's songs.  In this fashion, David Crosby comes across surprisingly sweet and romantic.  Stills is the master musician and entertainer.  Nash, on the other hand, seems to be struggling to keep up with the exception of \\"Teach Your Children\\".<br /><br />4 WAY STREET is important (if for no other reason) for introducing Neil Young to an eager young audience.  Young had been an integral if quixotic pillar of the Buffalo Springfield and he had released three excellent solo albums.  But to most, Young was an unknown and his performances on this album opened up a completely new world in songwriting and gave us the newly minted archetype of the reclusive, eccentric rock artist.  His acoustic \\"On The Way Home\\", \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" and \\"Don't Let It Get You Down\\" were unusually warm and moving moments on the original LP.  The inclusion of his medley of \\"The Loner\\", \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"Down By The River\\" only extends the wonder of his craft-it only remains a mystery why they couldn't find a way to put it on the original.<br /><br />The CD version keeps the original set of the second LP found in the original edition.  Again, we have the same trading off between each other's material.  But, again, it is Young's \\"Southern Man\\" that is etched into your mind.  It is not that Crosby or Nash's songsare bad-they just don't push the emotional echoes as Young does.  The exception is Stills' \\"Carry On\\" followed by \\"Find The Cost Of Freedom\\".  The first is a musical joy.  The second is inexplicably arresting and moving.<br /><br />This is one of those \\"essential albums\\" you owe it to yourself to purchase.  This was CSNY when they were absolutely white hot.  The rest of the 1970's should have been a lot more like this.  It wouldn't hurt if today's music were a little more like this as well.does.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I am just finishing up my first complete listen of this album.  Okay, so I was a little preoccupied as I was doing so and maybe I had a bit of trouble understanding the lyrics because the voices are a bit garbled.  However, the music is nonetheless beatiful and once I sat down at my computer and checked out the lyrics online, I was just struck by how wonderful this band was.  So melancholy but yet hopeful.  And that last song, \\"In the Back Seat\\" -- some have claimed that perhaps this album slows down at the end.  Yet this song I found to be the most beautiful and aching of them all.  I was brought to tears by the vocals.  It was a very emotional listen.
0395645662|4.0|one cannot experience joy. That is how I experienced this book. I found it in my elementary school library and the title intrigued me. Upon finishing it, I determined that it is inappropriate for anyone under the age of 14. Some of the imagery is too disturbing. However, I became engrossed in it's superior writing and interesting, though not original, premise. It is the unusual perspective that gives this book it's twist. No, it doesn't go into detail to describe HOW and WHY, Jonah's society is the way it is. I think it is a book that is meant for one to think about long after it has been finished.

The feeling of despair and the bad weather before the storm is felt on this her last offering.<br /><br />This CD now gets the treatment it deserves with it's lavish packaging and even though her voice is near shot it stands<br /><br />out as an emotional vehicle for her intonations and phrasing and use of time..her gift and claim to fame.<br /><br />A fitting purchase and a very eerie one.
0007117248|4.0|If you are familiar with Lewis' non-fiction writings (Mere Christianity, etc.) were all that Lewis had written he would have left a wonderful legacy. However, Lewis has a large library of fictional works as well.<br /><br />'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is my only my second piece of Lewis fiction (the other being 'The Screwtape Letters') and I found it to be a quick, enjoyable read. The characters are likeable but sketchy, but that is understandable considering that he intended it to be a fairy tale. How much character development is there in a fairy tale?<br /><br />Christian themes are very strong throughout the book, but the story can be read without any previous study into Christianity. If you are unsure of the themes or want to make sure that you are not missing any, I would recommend that you pick up any of the half-dozen or more companion study guides that Amazon offers.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|shakira is just amazing, i am almost at a loss for words. <br /> <br />i dont normally listen to political songs, but this girl suckered me into listening to hers with her flippant and (hard to describe) almost playfully sarcastic singing of it.  which turned out also quite beautiful.  how she does this i have no idea, just amazing.  (the Timor track 11) <br /> <br />i also have ALL of her spanish language albums, as i enjoy that i do not speak spanish and i can then process/perceive just the music and shakira's voice without analyzing it with my brain, just listen with my soul, and this would be quite a pleasure to listen to Shakiras Artistry without comprehending her poetry, but in english she gives me plenty to analyse to my minds and hearts delight. <br /> <br />i could, might normally be just a little jealous of a woman almost more beautiful then myself, but i cant even muster any jealousy whatsoever for Shakira, even if i were to, for some strange reason, to try. <br /> <br />thank you very much for all the music you've been making Shakira. <br /> <br />another one of my favorites (so far - cause i am trying so hard to make myself savor this as slowly as possible) is track 2 \\"Don't Bother\\", yeah, and Shakira, the only reason you can even say \\"cause she's way better then me\\" is cause YOU KNOW she's NOT and never ever will be. <br /> <br />i know you are just writing poetry and wonderful songs, and sometimes you feel a tinge of this or that, but i would just like to note here that you really have that 'sarcasm' down really well.  :) <br /> <br />most sincerely, <br />Katrina <br /> <br />
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Stewart plays Elwood Dowd in this American classic. Elwood is a drunk who hangs around with a giant white rabbit and makes life miserable for his sister and niece. This is not because he is mean or cruel or even because he is a drunk. It's because people just don't understand about the giant and invisible white rabbit.<br /><br />Most people have the impression that Elwood is crazy or that he is drunk and those are the reasons for the rabbit. Both are accurate and both are wrong. Elwood is a bit off the deep end. In a touching conversation with a shrink halfway through the film, Elwood explains how he came to have an alternate view of reality. He also likes his drink, particularly martinis, but he is not an incapacitated drunk. He is a happy one and quite functional. All of this is beside the point, however. The rabbit is real. He is a Pooka, a mischievous spirit from Celtic mythology. Most people can't see him.<br /><br />The film is a comedy of errors. His family is trying to have him committed but, at various times, many encounter the rabbit. The results usually make everyone happier but most consider that craziness must be involved. At one time or another, it seems like everyone is about to be committed. After everyone's antics, it seems that Elwood is the only really sane one in the entire show.<br /><br />It's a happy show. I could wish for the simplicity and the slice of Americana it represents. Too bad I'm not all that fond of drink.
0064430227|5.0|my father gave me a copy of \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" when i was just about four years old and i absolutely fell head over heels in love with Harold. i remember sitting on the floor for hours just flipping through this book page by page and imagining myself into the story. i truly believe that this book was the door that opened into my love of reading. So of course when i saw this book in my pre-schoolers book order i had to get it for him. and it turns out that he loves Harold almost as much as i did at that age. it's a wonderful story about how to use your imagination and that you don't need all of these high tech toys in the world today to do it. Harold only needed a crayon.
0553208845|3.0|This has been on my \\"should read\\" list for a long time, nearly 20 years.<br /><br />With all of that build up and anticipation you'd think I'd have more thoughts about it than I do. My one word review of the book is 'lukewarm.'<br /><br />It is neither a strong book nor a weak book. Siddhartha's spiritual quest is told in such a detached manner that, in the end, I feel detached from the whole exercise. I am uncommited to the character and I really didn't particularly care where his quest ended up.<br /><br />Perhaps that was the point of it all - it's his quest, you can do nothing but care about your own.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Yes this album is not one of there greatest but its not there worst album ever.  They have a new sound yeah but what did you expect.  They lost head, like losing a family member. You have to go on without them and this is what they came up with.  I think the new sound is awesome. Liar, Coming Undone, and Souvenir are great songs and the others arent bad.  They  give us a different kind of heavy. For you Korn fans who dont respect this....cool but i think you gotta give it a chance. We all knew that the sound was gonna change like they said and it did.  Cant wait to hear it live

B000003NA3|5.0|John Coltrane can be a difficult nut to crack-- over the course of a relativey brief career, he covered an enormous amount of ground, and it was only the last decade of his life-- starting with his 1957 tenure with Thelonious Monk after he kicked his heroin addiction, progressing through his second term in Miles Davis' band and leading up to his great recordings as a leader for Atlantic and Impulse!-- that he really began to move on.  In the years since Coltrane's death, the archives have been opened wider and wider and it's become apparent that Coltrane would record several pieces for release in one week that would never see the light of day because two weeks later, he'd have advanced even further.  As such, to hear a snapshot like this set-- four days of recording over five nights in November of 1961 at Manhattan's legendary Village Vanguard-- can be both exciting and revealing.  It also grants the luxury of having something longer than an album of one form to sink your teeth into. <br /> <br />In November of 1961, Coltrane had left Atlantic records for the fledgeling Impulse! label, and after the \\"Africa/Brass\\" record, this was his next recording.  His band was in transition, and Trane brought into the Vanguard with him his working group-- himself on tenor and soprano saxes, Eric Dolphy on alto sax and bass clarinet, McCoy Tyner on piano, Reggie Workman on bass and Elvin Jones on drums to the date.  Workman was on his way out of the band and his replacement, Jimmy Garrison, would perform as well-- Trane seemed to be feeling out the role of the bassists, sometimes performing with both, sometimes with one or the other.  Trane also used a few guests-- Ahmed Abdul-Malik performs on oud on three cuts (all takes of \\"India\\"), Garvin Bushell contributes oboe on two cuts (two takes of \\"India\\") and contrabassoon on one (one take of \\"Spiritual\\"), and Roy Haynes sits in on drums on one cut of \\"Chasin' Another Trane\\".  The result is something amazing. <br /> <br />The musicians stretch out-- Coltrane is clearly searching for something, and in Dolphy he's got a frontline partner capable of matching his intensity.  The two often pair soprano sax and bass clarinet or tenor and alto, with each receiving ample solo space.  Coltrane's is largely exploratory, reaching and searching, Dolphy alternates between firmly rooted in tradition and fierce explosiveness.  In the rhythm section, Coltrane had a band that would support his whims on this as songs stretched out sometimes as long as 20 or 25 minutes during ecstatic and frantic improvs.  Talking about highlights is difficult because the whole set is awfully good, but certainly the November 2nd show is of exceptional quality, with the entire set being nothing short of earthshattering. <br /> <br />Large portions of this set have seen release before in various recordings-- \\"Live at the Village Vanguard\\" and \\"Impressions\\" were the two records released in Trane's lifetime, with several posthumous collections drawn from these sessions, but this set nicely pulls it altogether, remasters the sound so the whole thing sounds fantastic, and adds a booklet with an essay concerning the music, musicians, and performances. <br /> <br />44 years later, as I write this, this music still sounds amazing, revolutionary, powerful and inspired.  There is work by Coltrane I prefer over this, but this set in its entirity is essential.  Highly recommended.
B00003CX5P|2.0|For Adults: one star:    The Phantom Menace is filled with cartoonish graphics (purple bouncing balls as weapons, fake looking locations and space battles straight out of a playstation game) which make the film appear confused in its origins - is it a cartoon or a film?    The film is devoid of substance of any kind, and its cynical idea that the bigger the better does not hold up. Its redeeming features are eliminated - Darth Maul, Liam Neeson, and the little kid is annoying with his 'yippeee!' dialogue.    Why is Yoda cross-eyed?    In a cinematic world that brings in subtle well-paced special effects such as in Lord of the Rings  - which has real locations that give it scope and size - TPM looks closed in and stuffy in comparison - with stiff walk-in-from the-left and exit-on-the-right character direction usually seen on a substandard theatrical play.    ...and the dialogue will make you burn up with embarrassment.    For Kids: four stars:    This film is filled with action packed sequences that will amaze you. It has funny moments involving favourites R2D2 and Jar Jar Binks. Though the background plot may seem too complex for younger viewers (it is, after all, about 'tax' - yippee!) there is enough sequences that will amaze - such as the pod race.    At the end of the day, this is a kids film. Whether this is the right direction for a 30 year old saga or not remains to be seen - but nevertheless kids will love this film.    The DVD is of excellent quality and has enough extras to get a good idea regarding the background and making of the film.
B000BVD460|2.0|After six years and four multi-platinum albums, as well as two gold with D-12, you'd think a man like Eminem would mix it up a little bit on his \\"Greatest Hits\\". But, like the real Slim Shady says in every other song, it's 'just the same ol' Marshall'. Most of the songs on this compilation are well past their prime, such as: \\"My Name Is\\", and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". That's like re-releasing DeVo's \\"Whip It\\". Nobody wants to hear it anymore, let alone buy it. For someone who's fought so hard to not be labeled pop, this cd is a giant step backwards. So put the cd back on the rack, go run and tell your friends this album's whack. Slim, the hip hop community is let down by this release. Next time write something worth listening to. Where's \\"Bad Meets Evil\\"? Or \\"Marshall Mathers\\"? Eminem said in an interview the songs on the cd would be 'the ones [he] takes as his personal best'. \\"Just Lose It\\" and \\"Without Me\\" are personal favorites? Maybe it is time for the great white hope to retire.
B0008ISM40|2.0|With one exception: \\"Know what you are?\\" is Trent at his best. <br /> <br />As for the rest of the album: you've heard it already. The lyrics are woeful - you'd find better in a high school poetry class, with titles like \\"Death\\". \\"With teeth\\" looks like an attempt to rewrite \\"closer\\" but it backfires badly. Maybe he thought \\"She gets you hard\\" would be all sexy and shocking. Maybe it is to teen girls, I dunno. <br /> <br />There's the trouble: the album's too juvenile in tone for older NIN fans who've been around since Spiral or before, and it's too retro in sound for the younger audience I assume he's attempting to market to. <br /> <br />Not the worst music being released, but that's not necessarily saying much.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A friend recommended the show \\"Firefly\\" to me a few months back. Per his advice, I picked it up. I skipped through a few episodes, didn't really watch much, and pronounced it \\"stupid.\\" Just before this movie hit theaters (I had no idea it was even in theaters until I saw the review section!), I sat down and seriously watched it - and I was hooked. It's science fiction in some of the best traditions of science fiction: witty, well-written, self-deprecating, individualistic, and with plenty of almost palatable comraderie to flesh out every scene. <br /> <br />And this movie? It's even better. It has all thrill and geniune fun (and much more serious elements, ultimately) that each of the new Star Wars movies lacked in some department, and more interestingly, none of the clear good-and-evil themes - and that after the \\"Firefly\\" rebels already lost badly. Most of all, the universe is utterly believable. This Joss Whedon cat plainly gleaned much from his science fiction forerunners, but he integrated it as a part of something distinctly his own creation. With genuinely good science fiction in such an awful back-burner rut (unless you count billions of dollars in ubiquitous Star Wars merchandise; thank God that's over), I'm simply happy that somebody stepped up to the task, boldly going where...well, where nobody has seriously gone in some time. <br /> <br />So yes, buy this movie, rent this movie, stick it in your kids' stockings. Just turn that God-awful cover towards the wall so they don't pitch it, thinking you got them a crappy B movie as a joke. Seriously though, it's probably the one Hollywood movie released this year that's utterly enjoyable and completely rewatchable. <br /> <br />On a side note, I'm 95% sure I saw Nathan Fillion (\\"Cap'n\\") in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" - he had a bit role as the first, mistakenly identified Private Ryan. On another side note, I've never watched Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They looked remarkably stupid.
B00005JM02|3.0|I loved the animation here.  I didn't like Marlin's voice or Nemo's, but that's minor.   <br />After watching this, I thought something was strange about it.  It didn't teach any good lesson other than \\"run for your life\\" basically because the whole time, Nemo was in distress either trying to save himself, or another.  It became repetitive and gave me a negative feeling about the movie. <br />The sharks were scary for my 3 year old.  Atleast in \\"shark tale,\\"  fear was not all you saw.  Shark Tale is funny.  This movie is just...  kind of sad.
B00005JOHI|5.0|This movie is a beautifully made movie! Matthew McFayden is GORGEOUS, and you'll fall in love with his Mr. Darcy if you haven't already.

B000001ELF|4.0|Of the four solo albums Ace's was the biggest surprise due to the success of the Russ Ballard penned New York Groove. The album was produced by Eddie Kramer who had previously worked with Kiss on Rock And Roll Over and Loved Gun. Perhaps that's one of the reasons Ace's album sounds the most like Kiss next to Paul's album. As expected there is plenty of rockin guitar from the Spaceman. My favorite tracks are Rip It Out, Speedin Back To My Baby, What's On Your Mind (love the chorus!), New York Groove, and the excellent instrumental Fractured Mirror (which would later give birth to Fractured II and III). Paul's album is still my favorite but Ace's is a close second. Get em both if you don't have them already! <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Relaxing but haunting. Innovational, brilliant and will blow your mind. <br /> <br />Hearing this CD at first, at the tender age of 13 (I'm 14 now..heh) I said, \\"Hey, this isn't better than The Bends!\\" agreeing with Rolling Stone's opinion. But, listening to this now, my alibi was proved wrong.  <br /> <br />Originally, I loved the Bends for being solid and having some incredible songs. But, listening to OK Computer now, I've realized, OK Computer has NO bad songs on it. They are all simply classics. <br /> <br />Here's my top 5 favorite songs you should listen to, <br />1. The Tourist <br />2. Paranoid Android <br />3. Lucky <br />4. Exit Music (For a Film) <br />5. Karma Police <br /> <br />All easily classics. <br /> <br />This is REAL music. Thom Yorke is one of the most prolific songwriters of the 90's and of rock history.  <br /> <br />I can't stress enough, buy this album NNNOOOWWW
B000BVEKO0|4.0|After a two year wait since Korn's last full leingth album, \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\", Korn have given us \\"See You On The Other Side\\", and despite their two year absence, Korn actually manage to deliver a pretty good comeback with this newest release. See You On The Other Side is composed of fourteen tracks, and only one of which isn't that great. Infact, it's horrible. But don't let one single track stop you from enjoying this highly anticipated release.    See You On The Other Side is Korn's very first release without their founding member and ex-guitarest, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch. But does it stand up to past releases which contained Brian within them? Ofcourse it does. Even though Head is gone and left, Korn still have managed to deliver this thirteen fists and a flick in your face, album.    The album kicks off with the single everyone has grown to love (and or hate), \\"Twisted Transistor.\\" While i'm not about to say this is the best song on the album, it's by far, not the worst. After this track, the album moves into angrier songs such as \\"Politics\\", and \\"Coming Undone.\\" Which are to me, two of the best tracks that this album has to offer.    See You On The Other Side is not a concept album, as the subject content really varies. Vocalist Jonathan Davis covers many issues on this release (as he does in most other releases) that range from Politics, Love, Self-Loathing, and Pride. So it isn't all angsty. It's actually quite balanced out, to an extent. But this time around, don't go expecting to be hearing Jon singing melodic songs, as See You On The Other Side, contains next to no melodic pieces at all. The album for the most part, is entirely based on heavy hitting riffs, well thought out lyrics, and loud noises. With a mix of synthesizers, to add to the mix.    If See You On The Other Side had to be compared to any of the past Korn albums, I would have to compare it to three of them:     -Korn  -Life Is Peachy  -Follow The Leader    That's right folks, it's comprised of the three heaviest hitting Korn albums available, that had little to no \\"soft\\" songs on them. So when Jon Davis said this album was going back to the old days of Korn, he wasn't jerking anyone around. See You On The Other Side really does sound like a mixture of these three albums, and a little flavour of its own.    It even has a little of that long-lost and very much missed \\"Queen of the Damned\\" vibe, to it.    Do any of the songs on See You On The Other Side, suck? Yeah. Sadly, one of the songs does suck. But again, do not let that stop you from enjoying this album for the most part. That's only 1/14 songs that aren't that great. I'll even rate the songs below for you all to get a feel of how good and or bad, they are.    1. Twisted Transistor: 4/5    -The single. Nothing that amazing, to be honest. Though while a good song, I feel it could've given more to me, than this.    2. Politics: 5/5    -A song with a strong message to it. And awesome vocals from Jon, especially within the chorus.    3. Hypocrites: 4/5    -Again, not the greatest song on the album. But a good one, nonetheless. And one of the hardest songs on the album. And it has a catchy pre-chorus.    4. Souviner (Of Sadness): 5/5    -This is a really, really good song. Very awesome beat, and vocals from Jon. Also, very catchy, as well.    5. 10 or a 2-Way: 3/5    -This is one of the weaker songs on the cd, but not the weakest. I'm just not too into the way this song sounds, to be perfectly honest.    6. Throw Me Away: 10/5    -Yes, a 10 out of 5. This song, right here, is the main reason to purchase See You On The Other Side. It has a serious \\"Queen of The Damned\\" vibe to it. It sounds like it could even have been a QoTD outake track. Very melodic, yet sinister and dark. DO NOT skip this song! It'll probably grow to be your most favorite song on the album.    7. Love Song: 5/5    -This is another really cool song. The lyrics are awesome, and even poetic dare I say. And the beat has a QoTD vibe to it. Again, another really cool song.    8. Open Up: 7/5    -Yes, a 7 out of 5. Another one of the REALLY GOOD tracks to See You On The Other Side. Again, quite melodic, but also quite enjoyable, as well. Everything about this song is awesome. The chorus, the verses, and the pre-chorus. Don't skip it!    9. Coming Undone: 5/5    -Quite possibly my most favorite non-melodic song, on See You On The Other Side. The beat to this song absolutely rules! The entire song has a serious \\"death march\\" vibe, to it. Very good track, indeed.    10. Getting Off: 4/5    -The lyrics are kind of perverted. Kind of very perverted. Not as perverted as \\"Beat It Upright\\", but perverted. Jon even makes a refrence to the song \\"Sean Olsen\\", at the end of this song. Pretty good song, but not the best. I suggest a listen, or two.    11. Liar: 5/5    -Is it just me, or do the begining beats and riffs to this song, sound familiar? Can't really place my finger on where from...but familiar. At any rate, this is a good song that I believe Jon Davis wrote for his half brother Mark Chavez. But I could be wrong. The lyrics are awesome, and I think Mark is actually featured in this song doing backup vocals in the pre-chorus. But again, I could be wrong. Either way, it's a good song.    12. For No One: 4/5    -This song is groovy! That's really all I can say about this song, other than you can't really understand what Jon is even saying in it. But it's still good. And has a nice beat, and chorus.    13. Seen It All: 3.5/5    -It pained me to give this a 3.5, but the verses to this song just seriously suck. But, the song DOES redeem itself, with the chorus. Again, not the best song on the album, but then again, not the worst either. Try it out...see if you can aquire a taste for this song.    14. Tearjerker (Saturated Lonliness): 2/5    -Yep. This is it folks. The end of the album, and a seriously crappy ending, might I add. This song actually put me to friggin sleep! There are next to NO drums in thissong, there's really no melody at all, and overall, this song is just...stupid. It has okay background music at times I suppose, but Jon's vocals on this are seriously...dare I say...WHINEY! This seems like it was a song to express Jon's midlife crisis or something. Like it appeals to the emo-scene or whatever. Sadly...this song I have to give a 2. It just isn't interesting...AT ALL.    BONUS DISC (For those of you whom purchased the DELUXE VERSION):    1. It's Me Again: 5/5    -This is an awesome song. And the begining of recycled beats from Jonathan Davis. This begins with the beat of \\"Did My Time.\\" But, uses it quite well. The lyrics are...angry. Very angry. Overall, it's a great song! I reccomend it.    2. Eaten Up Inside: 10/5    -Yes, 10 out of 5. This is the best song on the bonus disc. Again, recycled beats of \\"Did My Time.\\" But again, put to good use. The lyrics on this are friggin awesome! The beat really goes with the song. And the pre-chorus, and chorus, make this all worth the 3 minutes they give you of it! This song should have replaced that crappy \\"Tearjerker\\" song, on CD 1.    3. Last Legal Drug: 5/5    -Another GREAT song, we have here! This is a tad bit melodic, but not really. But at the same time, deals with the subject of Love. And again with the recycled beats. This one plays off the beats of \\"Thoughtless.\\" At anyrate, the lyrics on this, are some of the BEST i've heard come from Jon Davis in a long time! Do not skip this!    4. Twisted Transistor (Dante Ross Mix): 5/5    -Dare I say this is better than the original version? It starts out with a piano, and moves into hard hitting riffs that seem more brutal that the original versions riffs. I actually prefer this one, over the original on CD 1.    5. Twisted Transistor (Dummies Club Mix): 1/5    -Bottom line, I do not like this, nor any of the \\"club mix\\" versions of \\"Twisted Transistor.\\" They drag on for way too long, and are overall, a huge waste of time. The only noteworthy mix other than the Dante Ross Mix, is the \\"Feck (censored purposely) The Dub Mix.\\" That one is actually enjoyable. But the others, are horrible.    So, as you can see. Over all, See You On The Other Side delivers some pretty good music. And alot of it, that will make oldskool fans of Korn, smile. Although the final song on the actual album totally ruins the ending for everyone, the rest of the songs are noteworthy for atleast 3 plays. If not that, more.    In the end, I thought this was a pretty solid release from Korn. Not their best, but not their worst either. If the final song on the album didn't ruin the ending for me, i'd have given this album 5/5 stars. But sadly, I had to give it 4/5 stars, for that one song which just makes me wish i'd never have heard it to begin with.    4/5 Stars.    Also, there are 3 B-Sides to See You On The Other Side, which aren't available on the album nor the bonus disc (if you bought the deluxe version). They are called \\"Too Late I'm Dead\\", \\"Appears\\", and \\"Inside Out.\\" All which I give the rating 5/5 to. Especially, \\"Appears.\\"
0385510454|2.0|I have read and enjoyed most of John Grisham's books, but this one was a disappointment. Grisham sets up a weak story line that goes nowhere and tries to pass it off as a international thriller. There is a little military intrigue, ala Clancy but no lawyish excitement or thrill. I was waiting for the book to get interesting, then realized that since I was 2/3 of the way through the book, it wasn't coming. In the end, The Broker was a disappointing read and seemed contrived.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|After listneing to this album for about a week now i can say that it is one of systems best cds to date. A little side note this album is not recommended for bush supporters.It plays a little like a Pink Floyd CD has most of the songs are connected to each other EX: End of Vicenity of Obcenity is intro for She's Like Heroin.Now, time for the songs: <br /> <br />1. Attack:8/10 Pretty decent song. <br />2. Dreaming 8/10 Almost the same as Attack <br />3. Kill Rock and Roll 9/10 I love the intro to this song but the lyrics could have been better. <br />4. Hypnotize 9/10 I would like it more if it wasnt played as much on the radio. Best part is the drumming throught the song. <br />5. Stealing Society 10/10 one of my fav songs on the album. Really good vocals by Serj and Daron. <br />6.  Tentative 10/10 almost the same as Stealing Society <br />7. U-Fig 8/10 Lets just say it really bashes bush <br />8. Holy Mountains 100/10 One of the Best system songs EVER! Infact one of the best Nu-metal songs I've ever heard. You'l love this if you love Aerials from Toxicity. <br />9. Vicinity Of Obscenity 10/10 Whats a System CD without a crazy song? Lyrics are very catch too. <br />10. She's Like Heroin 8/10 Meh. <br />11. Lonley Day 9/10 Another great song. Should've had a little bit of metal / hard rock in it. <br />12. Soldier Side 90/100 Another Great System song. It is a really emotional song. <br /> <br />Like I said Earlier not for bush supporters unless, like me, you can take it or ignore it to a certain extent (U-Fig).
0375703764|4.0|When reading this book it is mezmerizingly easy to forget that you are, in fact, reading a book. The lump of paper and cardboard and ink in your hand becomes a living thing, and becomes to you what the house was to those who entered it- a mirror of your own consciousness. <br /> <br />Let me start off by saying that this is, by far, the most engrossing novel I have ever read. The challenge inherent in completing it, due to its meandering academic footnotes and senseless banter over the literary qualitites of things not particularly related to the topic (at one point there is a six-page discourse on the myth of Echo, which it turns out is simply there to provide a little more meaning to the fact that a young girl's voice echoes in the house when it should not do so), not to mention the several pages with little or no text on them, or text written diagonally or backwards or simply in a foreign language such as Greek, but often Latin or German, is high. I had to concentrate my eyes to read backwards, or to read Johnny's mother's correspondence in which she writes an entire letter but codes the actual message within by only making the first letter of each word relevant, but was unable to properly digest the upside-down or diagonal text without physically moving the book, which annoyed my dog to no end, as she was trying to take a nap on me at the time. Suffice to say, this book will challenge your patience and dexterity. It will also challenge your guts, as Truant warns of a monster that is coming up behind the reader at that very moment and if the reader looks, they are sure to be devoured. I looked. Did you? <br /> <br />My only real complaint in storyline content is that after about four graphic sexual encounters, one wonders if Johnny is not suffering from neurosis because of the book, but rather from some sort of sexually transmitted disease. Seriously, it gets old to watch him go from woman to woman, drink and do drugs and generally act stupidly. <br /> <br />However, here is where the book shows its real side, and where its beauty and intricacy best shines through. The reality of the magnificence of the two (three?) stories struck me most when, on the top part of one particular page, Zampano is describing in the dryest of literary academic language, the significance of something in Latin that one could easy pass over as pretentious and useless. On the bottom of this SAME PAGE, Truant in his footnotes is graphically having relations with a woman, likely under the influence of several drugs. <br /> <br />It was apparent to me for most of the book that The Navidson Record never actually existed. Zampano had been blind as a bat for, I recall, about fifty years, which means he was blind close to forty years prior to the filming, during the filming, and also during any resulting showings or viewings of the movie itself. Simply put, it is not possible that Zampano could have ever seen The Navidson Record and hence could never have written such a critique as is found in the chest. Zampano was a man obsessed with creation. He was so enthralled by his own bodily emanations that he never ventilated his apartment. All he did every day, besides walk, was write or draw or dictate. It would not be beyond a man like this, especially one with such literary fervor that he memorized everything he ever read, to create a film within his own imagination and then critique it and also others who critiqued it. <br /> <br />However, if the film did not exist, what killed Zampano? Why the scratch marks on the floor, reminiscent of those found in the Navidson house? Why would Truant slowly descend into madness? Years of drug use or some disease? We never see any evidence of this. We do not, in fact, see anything at all- ever. <br /> <br />This is the true beauty of the story. Like 'Alien' and 'Jaws' before it, we know that we know the monster is there- we just never see it. The Navidson house is monstrous in scope, yet inconspicuous in practice. All it does is change shape. The only real, tangible effect is the one it has on the psyches of its inhabitants. The same holds true for Truant's monster- he can smell it, sense it, he knows it's there, but he never manages to catch a glimpse of it. It drives him to madness without so much as a fleeting glimmer of actual harm. <br /> <br />All of these mysteries, wondering whether or not anything in this book, this book itself, or anything around you, is in fact real or makes any sense at all, is enough to make one say \\"something is very wrong here...\\"  <br /> <br />I spent 10 straight hours reading this book and finished it in one sitting, partially because the book was too good to put down but mostly because I knew if I didn't get to the end I'd have nightmares. I enjoyed it immensely and, if you like abstract art and abnormal styles of expression, you will as well.
0596007124|5.0|This book took the most novel approach to learning Java that I have ever seen.  I learned more about Java patterns reading this book then I learned in 1 class and 2 books.  With that said, the books learning style will not be for everyone.  This book uses lots of humor and quirky examples to get it's point across.  I took to the style like a fish to water.  However, for those of you who are into the more traditional format of Java books and computer books in general, then this book is not for you.  If you are a little more open minded and are willing to try something different when it comes to learning Java patterns, then I suggest this book.  I enjoyed this book so much that order two of the other books in the Head First Series (Java and EJB).
0446577383|5.0|This was THE BEST Baldacci book I have ever read.  It is thought-provoking, timely and scary.  Finally, an author who takes a clear look at what is happening in the world and how the policies of our government are having an impact on everyone on a world wide scale.  The characters are very realistic and we see examples of them all around us.  I am tired of reading and seeing stereotypical stories about Muslims who are out to destroy the United States.  This book explores the geopolitical events that have shaped our world as it is today and it does so in a fast-paced, suck-you-in-to-the-last-page manner.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  To those of you who think it is America-bashing it is time you pulled your head out of the sand and learned the true history of this country.  The events in this book are not so far-fetched and we all better wake up and realize how precious this world us before we allow our leaders to destroy it.
B000063CPL|5.0|Holy crap!! With the 2 last great studio albums, Maiden put out another excellent live album. This live album is the proof that the modern Maiden is just good as the 80's Maiden and that even these days they can still crank metal that is actually metal. This live album is easily Maiden's best, even better than 'Live After Death' (which kicked ass as well), and I'll tell you why.    Some reviewers here claim that LAD was better because that had the best tracklist, but c'mon, what do you wan't them to do, to make 5 live albums with the same tracklist?   Other complain that it has nothing from the late 80's albums except for 'The Evil Men That Do', and even this sounds better here.  I was surprised to not see 'Wasted Years' or 'Heaven Can Wait' here, but 'Somewhere in Time' is actually my least favorite IM album from the 80's so it doesn't really bother me.  Here you have what the 90's songs lacked, and this is Bruce vocals and Adrian's killer solos. My favorite track here is 'Fear of the Dark', and it is the best version ever made to this song, with Adrian's solo. 'Sign of the Cross' is also much better than the studio version, Blaze sang this well but Bruce did it better.   Most of the early 80's songs sound better on LAD with the exception of 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' and 'Run to the Hills', because of Bruce vocals, but the still kick here.   There is also 3 guitarists, and believe me, it helps here. And there is also double bass drumming, which wasn't on LAD, and that really helps in tracks like 'Hallowed be thy Name', but this song  still sounds at its best in the studio.   There are some songs that sound even better live like those I listed above, but as well 'Blood Brothers', 'Ghost of the Navigator', 'Clansman' and 'Run to the Hills'.   The production is also good, although on LAD it was better but slightly. It's certainly better than the production crap on 'Live at Donington' and 'Real Live Dead One'.  If I have any complaints, it should be as people said, thereare too much songs from 'Brave New World', there should be more songs from 'Powerslave' (the best metal album ever, period). The only 2 tracks I was dissapointed with are '2 Minutes to Midnight', and 'Wrathchild', they sound at their best in the studio and here the vocals don't fit the instruments.    If you like live concerts and Maiden and don't have this, get it now. Don't waste your money on Metallica's or Linkin Park's concerts (Metallica has good stuff, but today their concerts just blow), Maiden destroys them live (and LP in the studio, IM can get away without a DJ and millions of synthersizers to enhance their sound).
1400032717|5.0|If you're looking for a serious book, this isn't it.  If you're looking for in-depth information on Autism, do move on.  You will however - learn the life of an autistic boy through his innocent explanations and off the wall illustrations.  Although it does seem to be an accurate portrayal of Autism, the young narrator is still an individual.  And despite his complicated and definitive way of life that can be categorized into a genetic disorder, his voice is precisely his own.  And to incorporate this into a mystery is brilliant and unique - especially since it takes a turn into family, betrayal and innocence...all at once. <br /> <br />I tend to love books like Curious Incident in that they are straight forward and although the humor or sorrow is not intended, it is definitely there.  Haddon has an incredible imagination. <br /> <br />It does get to be a little too much brain disfunction as some explanations take a wacky turn and stay lost for too long.  It recovers easily though since the plot can make a great book on its own - without the Autism, that is.
B000002GKT|5.0|\\"Are you ready?  Even you people behind the glass pane at the back of the hall!  Are you ready?\\"<br /><br />Early today I wrote a review about the Stones Get Yer Ya Ya's Out and mentioned this Humble Pie set.  Later today my neighbor was annoying me with what must be 50' subwoofers playing Earth Wind and Fire \\"Bah-de-ah Bah-de-ah-de-ah-da\\". I got in the car to escape that sugary racket.  I drove over to the Fry's electronics mega-store in Tempe AZ and picked this sucker up.  It is blazin' away as I type this.  I'll bet I haven't heard this in 30 years.  It is SSSSSSSSSMOKIN'!!!<br /><br />I'm betting that when Steve Marriott was a kid his mother fed him large doses of Ritalin each day to keep him from burning the house down (no disrespect intended, Marriott actually died when his house burned down).  There's enough energy here to shut down the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant, plug in and power the entire valley (Phoenix metropolis) with this live session of Pie!<br /><br />When a 17 year old boy listens to this recording (I'm being autobiographical here folks), he just doesn't have a real appreciation for what a consumate entertainer Steve Marriott really was.  What a shame he's gone.  I'm listening to this with a more mature set of ears tonight and it really is superb.  Marriott and the audience are having a heck of a great time together. He's like a guitar-totin' blues-powered Evangelist calling the audience out to convert!  They're all out there singing \\"I'm a Rollin' Stone\\" along with Marriott.  Now I can see why Mick Jagger said \\"absolutely no Marriott!\\" to Keith Richards when Marriott auditioned to take Mick Taylor's place in the Rolling Stones.  This CD really makes me wish I could go back in a time machine and witness this performance because a CD or an LP or a cassette tape really can't capture this kind of excitement and energy.  I believe Frampton should push A&M to remaster this classic and release an anniversary edition sometime soon.  Until then, we'll just have to make do with this AAD remaster.  It's ok sound-wise and don't let the short track list fool you, there is almost a 73 minute helping of pure Pie goodness here. What are you waiting for?  Click your cart button already!<br /><br />...And I am definitely ordering the Humble Pie King Biscuit Concert where The Pie sounds as good or even better (if that's really possible)!<br /><br />Now, where was I?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just a few months ago I watched the movie \\"Serenity\\" in theaters to be blown away by the witty, comical and dramatic dialogue as well as the proper use of computer graphics. My brother, before I watched the movie, told me it was the best sci-fi movie that had been released since Minority Report and far surpassed that movie. Of course I was skeptical, but he was true to his word. Not only was I blown away by Serenity, but also I was left craving for more. Such a desire was fulfilled for the two weeks I took in watching the series (and trust me, it was hard to make the series last that long), but now I am left with the concern that this show has been discontinued. Such an innovative program that introduces one into a highly complex set of relations between nine equally interesting characters should not have been cancelled half way through its first season. Thus it seems highly reasonable to state that Fox has made a huge mistake. With a sci-fi show that makes the new Battlestar Galactica look like a big joke (which I was a big fan of before I watched Firefly), Joss Whedon's highly ambitious mixture of a somewhat 'Western' mentality with a sci-fi spin could have been a huge success if advertised correctly. Also, the tyrannical Alliance government that seems to equally ignore all of their planet's needs with the interesting historical background that has forced the average citizen to speak Chinese provides the viewer with an undeniably unique experience. Overall, this show should not be avoided, but exalted by those who have watched it in order to pressure some broadcasting company (it doesn't really matter which one) to continue the show.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|The new korn album is very good maybe there most creative album since follow the leader....But this is to new for me to judge if it's my fav or not but I really like what I have heard already....Even though the regular release was nine dollars on sale for the 1st day releas I still got the delux set and differently worth it. The 3 bouns tracks rock and should have been on the regular cd and the videos r kool 2 live performances..... It's heavy and Davis brings out the bagepipes again so pick this up it's kinda of a mixture of all their cd's in one....
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have to admit, I was slightly nervous about the second album. I thoroughly enjoyed the first, so I didn't want the formula to change too much. Closer seems to have the best of both worlds, taking points from the old album that work, but combining new flavor. For instance, the first track, Oceano, contains the raw power that Alla Luce Del Sole has. However, the track has more of a Latin rhythm, and the Italian pronnunciation has improved. A wonderful first track. Another innovative listen is Remember when it rained, a track that Josh played piano on, co-wrote the music, and wrote the lyrics. His piano style is substantially different from David Foster ( David favors arpeggios, Josh plays straight cords more) His instrumental bridge is reminiscent of Eric Carmen's \\"all by myself\\" bridge, which was covered by Celine Dion, another of Foster's songs. This song features lyrics that are more raw than the English songs on the first album, and the message and delivery combine to bring an emotional song to life. These are just two examples of the wonderful songs included in Closer. The wide range of style and scoring provides a song for everyone.  <br /> <br />>>> ALSO RECOMMENDED:Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 by MEHDI...An absolute Gem. Full Samples are at SoothingMusic Com...Just  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BMSTMS|5.0|i must admit i was afraid of what would happen to korn after brian left. i was definitely concerned that the new cd would not rock out as much as their past efforts. i can now rest at ease knowing that losing a member has just made them heavier. jon, munky, fieldy, and david have undoubtedly made the best korn record as of late with \\"see you on the other side\\". songs like \\"souvenir\\", \\"politix\\", and the first single \\"twisted transistor\\" just add an Isis-type heaviness to their already bludgeoning attack. one of the plusses on this cd is that fieldy seems to have gotten rid of his annoying slapping technique. he plays a lot more sophisticated bass lines. david switches up rhythms a lot on this cd, so instead of just keeping it straight 4/4 time, he adds a few more snare hits to throw you off. plus the whole band just lumbers along through most of the cd, like the average korn fan is used to. they use a few more samples and sound bites this time around too, and while it does get a little bit annoying, you quickly forgive and forget as they switch into the next song. all in all, a very worthy cd for you to own. go get it now.
0670033375|3.0|I read \\"Collapse\\" after having read and thoroughly enjoyed \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" several years ago.  \\"Collapse\\", however, was a bit of a disappointment.  The book's hype precedes it!<br /><br />Perhaps I'm simply unfashionable but the views of Professor Diamond seem like just more of the same old gloom and doom.  We're all going to hell in a handcart.  The world's heating up, its resources are finite and pollution is consuming us all.  Heck, I'm an environmentalist and only I know the path to true salvation!  I'm sorry but these people are just a bit preachy for my liking.<br /><br />Yes, other societies have failed.  Yes, bad choices have been made.  However, don't leap from this position to claiming that it follows that modern society will meet the same end.  This is just one claim too far.  It's the old fallacy argument that I learnt in high school: \\"post hoc, ergo propter hoc\\".  After this, therefore because of this.  But gloom and doom is sure to sell and if another conclusion is reached then don't expect a best seller.<br /><br />In Diamond's defence, he has both traveled and studied very widely.  He is familiar with the USA, Australia and many of the more remote parts of the Pacific such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.  His historical research is truly commendable.  My issue with him is the conclusions that he draws.  It is this gloomy almost self-righteous conclusion that sticks in my craw.

This was one book that when I sat down to read it, I didn't do anything else until I had finished it.  <br /> <br />The words and descriptions within this novel are so amazing that you can see, hear, smell, and taste the situations that McCourt and his family were enduring. <br /> <br />To go through the life that they had, and for Frank McCourt to make so much of himself, should be a lesson to everyone that feels as if life is unfair or treated them unkindly.

B000BMSTMS|3.0|I take it that most of the people who have actually read my review for \\"Twisted Transistor\\" on Xanga are wailing and telling me that I should stick a vibrator where the sun doesn't shine right about now. To tell you the truth, when I first listened to that song, I didn't hate the song, but I was torn: I was good with it because ever since \\"Y'all Want a Single\\", KoRn took the route where they wanted to play the type of music they want to make, instead of becoming everyone's favorite haunted puppets influenced by a rough childhood. And since Brian \\"Head\\" Welch left KoRn for religion, KoRn may loose only a bit of their edge, and may have to be a little on the experimental side. What I didn't enjoy about it? : \\"Twisted Transistor\\" sounded a little like a mostly half-asched attempt at broadening their sound back then. Another plus was that those who wanted to burn KoRn and their records at the stake by the time Untouchables and Take a Look in the Mirror came out get to hear what KoRn sounds like moderate and over it.  <br /> <br />        While I'm listening to this, I must warn those expecting the album to not expect anything but a small change from their last 6. The album has Jonathan Davis raging, but this one doesn't sound as forced as Take a Look in the Mirror. (Listen to \\"Right Now\\", and tell me if that is real anger or if it was just a forced crack of a smile in the face of darkness.) When you listen to \\"Twisted Transistor\\", rather than expecting anything Nu-Metal waiting to crack your skull with a note alone, hey try to prove that they don't need Head to keep the music funky. (\\"Twisted Transistor\\" has a Hip-Hop beat for those who have accepted change.) It seems that Korn leader is only a little bit done with aiming and firing at those who has wronged only him. (See the bands 5th album, Untouchables). Now he wants to blow fire on other things like high school teenagers swinging off at the machine (\\"Politics\\" \\"You want to sleep with anyone you'll get to whoyou need to know/ you think that's the way, don't you?\\"), pretenders (\\"Hypocrites\\"), perverts (\\"Getting Off\\"), and cupid's evil twin brothers (\\"Liar\\"), and still finds time and a few nerves to be a close mentor to rise against those who wronged them (\\"Souvenir\\").  <br /> <br />        If those of you are a bit confused about \\"Twisted Transistor\\"s change, they should hear what wonder they have did with sympathy-liner and my vote for potential 3rd single \\"Throw Me Away\\". As you listen to this song, even the most indie hipsters who thought KoRn was a bit irritating would enjoy the imagery and pain this song wrings out. Same going with the disturbing loved song for the Chuckys and Tiffanys out there ...err...\\"Love Song\\". For those who are waiting for me to pick my vote for kind of bad song, I admit that \\"Coming Undone\\" is a song that you will not enjoy so much, if you don't get the purpose of the song.  <br /> <br />        All in all, if I had my way and listed Korn's best album, this can go right next to the very first album. It may also be the second best if I had heard it. The album sounds like KoRn's way of admitting that in a world where messages get twisted, and the artistic view needs a bit of refining, whether the people or the fans like it or not, in a career, sometimes there's no other way to go but down. (At least that is what the title is telling us.) And if this really is the last contribution to the teenage wasteland soundtracks, as much as I really try, I can't think of a better sounding comeback or a better sendoff. <br /> <br />Rating: 7.25/10
0452270073|2.0|Being a fan of the War genre novel, I had considerable hopes for Barker's Regeneration.  The publisher describing the book as \\"one of the most amazing feats of fiction of our time\\" only spurred me to devour it all the more quickly.  Now finished, I think it's safe to say William Abrahams may have exaggerated the book's merits a wee bit.  Why?  Read on!  <br /> <br />First, does the book accomplish what it sets out to do?  If we agree the novel's main point is to portray the psychological effects of WWI on its young warriors, I'd say no.  The victims presented here are merely (as astutely observed by another reviewer) sketches, the sum of a few clean-cut psychotic symptoms.  This is especially true of two main characters, Sassoon and Prior - the latter seemingly more bothered by his asthma than neurosis.  The most interesting case - a poor lad who, because of a particularly gruesome incident, can no longer hold down food - is given only scant attention.  Which is unfortunate, as his were the most moving passages in the book.  The psychological effects of WWI have been captured more effectively in other novels (see The Sun Also Rises). <br /> <br />Second, the love story-lines are curiously underdevoloped.  Prior and Sarah share an interesting tale at first, but it quickly degenerates to the standard mush, ending unexpectedly early on a particularly vapid note.  Also, through odd hints and asides, nearly every male character is insinuated homosexual.  This could have been an interesting development, but is ultimately left unrealized.   <br /> <br />Third, Pat's prose is clumsy.  Or maybe I just don't like it.  \\"He slipped his hands underneath her, lifted her, until her whole pelvis became a cup from which he drank.\\"  Sorry, but that sentence, and others like it, just made me cringe.  Also, nearly every other word of dialog is initialized for emphasis, creating a haughty taughty, \\"aren't we a fancy lot\\" air to all conversations.  It's annoying.  People don't talk likethat.   <br /> <br />Lastly, some major revelations to the story's themes and motives are made through analysis of character's dreams.  That's just lazy writing (see ch. 22).   <br /> <br />Still, it's a quick read, and not totally devoid of merit (not half-bad, actually).  Just not worthy of the 5 star ratings.  <br />-MickBane
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am a great fan of the material girl, however  as a good fan i must accept it:This is not a Madonna's album at all, of course it is great, and i am a fan of great albums, but Madonna is just  the girl that poses so the album sells, she doesn't invent the loops, she doesn't meake music, she doesn't sing, she doesn't play any instrument, sorry but whith or without Madonna this album works.

Well, I couldn't carry her.  And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin.  And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her.  And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style.  His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2-million to make a whiskey commercial.<br /><br />Whiskey.  I think that is what it is.  I don't like whiskey or cigarettes and I usually don't like people who like cigarettes and whiskey, although I recall a song from my parents' time: \\"Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild women/They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane.\\"  (I'll take the wild, wild women.)  Such might conquer the boredom felt by out-of-towners in a high rise hotel in downtown Tokyo that director Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) was at great pains to get across to us in the opening scenes.  I also don't like bars and I think that people who spend their time hanging out in bars are mostly lonely alcoholics.  Ditto for gratuitous smoking in movies and obvious product placements.<br /><br />So I almost gave up on this, but the DVD jacket does say, \\"OVER 80 FOUR-STAR REVIEWS.\\"  (That would five stars on Amazon.)  Something must be wrong with me.  Or maybe there is a big contrast coming in the second half of the film, and all this 21st century, big city, international First World ennui is necessary to set that up.  But isn't it a little heavy how Scarlett hangs around in her panties waiting for her husband to return, and when he does he either goes to sleep or off to doing something else.  Wow, one would think he would NOTICE.  The camera surely does.<br /><br />Okay, I saw the rest of the film and ...<br /><br />There is a lot of artistic shtick in this movie. In fact it would be an art movie if it weren't aimed so directly at the mass mind--well, the mass mind over thirty.  The long pauses and the way the camera lingers to SHOUT: notice this scene! how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.<br /><br />But I like the clumsiness of their relationship and the way it is drawn out.<br /><br />The shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log.  Mount Fujiyama in gray in the background; Mount Fujisan in the background in full color and snow cap.  The games arcade in Tokyo, the game machines like Vegas slot machines all in a row.  The clean, straight lines of the bars and the exercise rooms, black and whites; the square wooden bowls out of which they drink the wine; the lights at night on the boulevard, outdoing Times Square in their gaudy neon-ness.  The touristy feel to the movie.  The Japanese untranslated.  The sleeplessness as though they were near the Arctic Circle with twenty hours of daylight.  The easy Hollywood feel to the psychology: our hero's pix on the side of trucks drinking Japanese whiskey, suavely; the need for the hero to hide from his public; his obviously dyed hair; the \\"satire\\" of the blonde mediocre starlet who affects anorexia; the sense that Sofia Coppola lived something like this.  One can imagine her boredom, and then the interested older man.<br /><br />I also liked the bit with the semi-talented lounge singer, again like Las Vegas--her picking him up, so to speak, he too drunk to protest or to remember.  Again the Hollywood idea of the pecking order.  The banality of the glamorous life.<br /><br />It is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.<br /><br />I guess I should say whythis movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature.  It is that I have been there where Bill Murray's character was and I played it the same way.  I am not so sure I did the right thing.  I tell myself I did, but I am not so sure.<br /><br />See this for Sofia Coppola who made her father proud./>I guess I should say why this movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature.

B000B8QF14|4.0|Outstanding CD with lots of energy and a pretty good song selection. However, what's with the meager 65 minute running time? Could have easily added 3 or 4 more GD classics. I am totally disappointed these days with rock acts that put only 60/65 minutes of material on media that has a capacity of 80 minutes, especially live releases. Most bands perform shows that last about two hours. You'd think it would be easy to find enough to fill 'em up. Also, seems almost sacrilegious to not follow Brain Stew with Jaded. Oh well. Better to have this CD than nothing at all......
B000BVD460|3.0|Curtain Call - The Hits, is not a \\"best of\\" Eminem album, it is basically every Eminem single from his four cds made into a compilation with a few new songs for incentive to buy.  The single for the album, \\"When I'm Gone\\", is a deep song depicting the troubles of neglecting family while trying to maintain status in the music industry.  This song is written in famous Eminem fashion, great lyrics, including dialogue between himself and his daughter.  The other two new tracks, \\"FACK\\" and \\"Shake That\\", do not belong on a greatest hits album because they are at best mediocre songs.  The former is an immature tale of..well you will have to hear it to believe it.  If you are a fan of Eminem based on what you have heard on pop radio, this CD is right for you.  If you appreciate the artform of hip-hop, then perhaps you should pass on this money making excuse for Interscope until a true \\"best of\\" album is released showcasing Mr. Mathers complete talents.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Jim Carry+Kate Wenslete= A great screenplay= A AMAZING MOVIE! This movie is about a machine that erases people from your mind and the main thing in the movie is that he is trying to save his memories from being erased. So the movie starts that he meets a really werid girl named Clemintine. So he losens up with her and then they break up. So he decides to erase her because he is becoming moraly depressed. The movie is great. You have Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and other stars making this one of the best film of 2003/2004. I say buy this now because if you love werid and twisted. <br />Jared
0553801503|2.0|Here's the thing  - these books are great, we all know that.  So any criticism is in that light.<br /><br />But splitting up the narrative made this the weakest of the series.  I think the jump cuts from character view point to view point gave the other books a certain depth and rhythm that this one didn't have - and I think it was a direct result of reducing the number, and scope of viewpoints.<br /><br />This was a glaring failure for this book...and in light of the horrible trend in Fantasy fiction of dragging out every series beyond what the story can bear in order to make more $, it made it even harder to read.<br /><br />I am depressed about this trend, and I think it is a function of the contempt of the editors of these books for both the readers and the literary tradition.  Essentially they know we'll buy it, so they don't care about working with the writer to make it better.  The remaining motive is profit - and there are rather obvious reasons to suspect that the publishers desire to sell twice as many bestsellers had something to do with the decision to break the book into two parts.

Anywho, you got the stoner friend who works off his phone and gets a promotion (yawm) and racium to3rd world countries like 1.34 can bu you a hotel....

B00005JO1J|5.0|I went to the film version this past weekend and was blown away.  Not only did I find the film extremely powerful, but in a way, it was able to capture the small things a person can miss when seeing the play in a large theatre.  Yes, one does miss the live interaction of Broadway, the intense energy that comes from a live performance.  But the movie version of RENT delivers every single emotion the theatre performance has...and occasionally, I think it delivers those emotions with a bit more of a punch. <br /> <br />The six original cast members reclaim their roles with authority, and the two newcomers live up to the extremely high bar set by the veterans.   <br /> <br />The story is powerful, the music is emotional, combined it's an amazing experience.  A must-see movie.  I know I will be one of the first in line when the DVD is available.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|I dont understand the 5 star reviews.  The tracks sound like very pared down versions of Donna Summer songs from the late 70's.  That could be interesting, but the tracks are too pared down to the point of inducing boredom. The talking-singing is simply terrible -- there's some irony in the cheeky lyrics but its not exactly deep irony.  Really, the guy can't sing.     2 years from now LCD Soundsystem will be very ancient history.     Save your $$
B0001XAPY2|5.0|One of director Hayao Miyazaki's (\\"Spirited Away\\", \\"Princess Mononoke\\") earlier works is a film called \\"Porco Rosso\\".  \\"Porco Rosso\\", like his other films, is an animated movie and this one features a pig as an ace pilot and bounty hunter.  But before we think this movie is going to veer into the territory of Looney Tunes, Porco is the only character in the movie who is not human and we learn later midway through the movie that he used to be human but seems to be cursed in some way.  The rest of the film is grounded a sense of reality, though a slightly skewed reality.<br /><br />Porco (voiced by an unrecognizable Michael Keaton) is a sea-plane pilot and a bounty hunter.  He works for money and usually to protect others (still for pay, not out of any generosity of spirit as he claims he has none).  Early in the film we see Porco foil a kidnapping by a bumbling sea-plane pirate gang, and the pirate leaders from the region are out to put a stop to Porco's success against them.  They bring in this American pilot (voiced by Cary Elwes), one of the fastest in the world.  The American's job is to make Porco look silly and to put him out of a job, if not kill Porco.<br /><br />\\"Porco Rosso's\\" storyline does not progress the way I would have expected.  Even though the film clocks in at 90 minutes, \\"Porco Rosso\\" has a leisurely pace that feels as if Miyazaki knows exactly where he is going and is in no hurry to get there.  I was surprised by just how much humor there is in the movie.  The pirates bungle and bumble quite often, but they also drop these throw away lines that are simply funny, but only when you're watching the movie.  Trying to list a series of these lines wouldn't be funny when one line that made me laugh was simply \\"okay\\", but it was when and how it was said that made the joke.  The other thing about this movie was that I was interested in what happens to Porco, and what did happen to Porco, and what will happen.  I cared about the character and also in his Engineer friend and the friend's granddaughter (voiced by Kimberly Williams) who is just as good of an engineer as any and a very important character.<br /><br />Simply put, the movie worked.  On all levels.  Animation gives the false impression that it is automatically for children, and children can and would enjoy \\"Porco Rosso\\", but Miyazaki's films work for adults as well.  This is just a good movie.  Period.  It joins \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" as my favorites Miyazaki movies and is one I happily recommend.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryin his Engineer friend and the friend's granddaughter (voiced by Kimberly Williams) who is just as good of an engineer as any and a very important character.   <br /> <br />Simply put, the movie worked.

0767834739|1.0|When I saw \\"Resident Evil\\" I like it, although it was a free version of the game, of the story. But \\"Resident Evil - Apocalypse\\", it's disastrous. With a useless explanation by Alice of what happened in the first film and flashbacks. I think they made some kind of mistake when editing the film because the story can be confusing. The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable.
0671319809|5.0|not only it is good space opera, even for those like me, who is not military or ex military; but it is an excellent political thriller as well.  WARNING: Do not attempt to read this book unless you have the time! otherwise it will raise havock with your schedule!!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|stunning.  the concert dvd is simply stunning.  the documentery dvd is a curious added bonus because it includes discarded version of wellknown songs such as BTR and Jungleland.  anyway the real treat for me is the live version of \\"Lost In The Flood\\".  this song is one of Springsteen's greatest epics.  before \\"Jungleland\\", before \\"Backstreets\\", before \\"NYC Serenade\\", before \\"Incident\\" there was this song.  i'm glad that the Boss has brought this song back into his sets on recent tours, it's vastly overlooked and underrated.  great version of \\"Quarter to Three\\" on here also.<br /><br />the remastered cd is not so impressive.  i really can't hear a difference but then again i've only listened to it in my car.  perhaps when i listen to it on my home sterio it will sound different.<br /><br />overall this is the definative version of Born To Run.  why would you even bother buying the normal cd version now that this is available?  oh, go buy Devils & Dust too.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Luc Besson is the most surprising person in the cinema industry. He is able to transform any banal, ordinary, simple, even superficial story into the deepest mirror of human fate. Here he deals with the sea, this mother of us all. A young boy loses his father who dies when diving for a living, to exploit the natural fauna of the deep sea. The angry mother the sea took the father away since the mother of that child was no longer here. The sea provides him with a new surrogate father : the world champion in deep diving. This new father is going to guide him onto a way that leads ever deeper and ever longer under the water. These scenes are fascinating because they are short and they stir in our minds all kinds of fear, fright and fantasm. But this fate that calls him to the sea becomes a dilemma because the sea provides him with a new family of dolphins, with their language, their playing games, their grace and beauty, their call for the deep, for joining the sea and merging into it. What happens when a girl comes into the picture and reveals to Jacques his male genetic fertility ? That's the drama. The angry mother the sea strikes again and takes the surrogate father away in a crazy challenge to go too deep and die there. Then the call of this angry mother is too strong. Then the call to go back to the cocoon of the ftus is too strong. Luc Besson reaches here in simple images and poignant scenes the mythic level and we can hear in the back of our cultures all these episodes about the survival of humanity after the big flood, Noah is here with his Ark, Moses with his crossing of the Red Sea, but also all the other myths from all over the world that have to do with this sudden unexplained rise of the ocean level. And then Luc Besson produces a cult film that will probably never die and is as universal as Oedipus.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Everything about mimi seems to be multiplying at the moment. Her re-releases, her body, her face, her bank account. The way she looks at the moment, you would think that she eats all the money she earns. <br /> <br />I, for one, will definately not be buying the Dec 27th Edition of this album.
B000002MUW|3.0|Madonna's 'Bedtime Stories' is quite a departure from 1992's 'Erotica' which to some, tried too hard to be provocative. At the time, Madonna had alienated some of her audience with her various career choices, all of which seemed to be sexual in some type of way. Whatever Madonna's motives,the world had seemed to get over the frenzy and warm up to her once again, this time on 1994's 'Bedtime Story'. It's an album that doesn't go out of it's way to be soft and sensual; it just is. Much of it is about falling in and out of love, some of it is about responding to her critics. On \\"Human Nature\\", the only song that could be deemed \\"explicit\\", she sings \\"OOps I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex\\", with a razor sharped tongue that declares that she does not regret her very public sexual revolution. This track is a bigger vixen than \\"Erotica\\", and yet not as naughty as \\"Justify my Love\\". One theme on the album that is very indirect is transvestitism, on the hit first single \\"Secret\\". I have said before Madonna has a problem with lyrics and most would be surprised this is even about this social issue. It is. The song is so good though you have to forgive her subliminal message. For an artist that is so out there with her daring self expression, she surprisingly can hold a lot back. Maybe that's the point; it's one secret we weren't supposed to find out about. The rest of the album is a big soft cushion, made for late night listening. From the haunting \\"Sanctuary\\", which samples Herbie Hancock to the Bjork-penned and produced \\"Bedtime Story\\" to the oh-so-sweet hit single \\"Take a Bow\\", few can argue that 'Bedtime Stories' is a bad dream. While afterwards she had to prove that she hadn't gone adult contemporary, it was a nice transition from all the hoopla surrounding the 'Sex' period. One warning: if you came to dance, you may be dissapointed. If you came to veg out, sit back and enjoy.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|while i agree that some of the relationships could have been further expanded upon, this movie is just wonderful. its funny, sexy, enchanting, silly...it simply takes you away for the entire movie. and, although one reviewer said all the love lines end well, he was mistaken!  enjoy
B00005Q66T|4.0|GHV2 is a great album if you're looking for a collection Madonna's bigger hit singles. Unlike Immaculate Collection, GHV2 does not contain any bonus songs, which would have been nice, considering all of us have the albums these songs are on. Also, the edited versions are very obvious. Aside from all that, its a sweet slice of Madonna's 1990s work. Much of 1992's 'Erotica' was underrepresented,from that album is the title track and it's disco followup \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", which has gone from one of her lesser known hits to one of her finest over the years. I thought the omission of \\"Rain\\" was odd, even though it was on the ballad collection 'Something to Remember' in 1995. Even though it wasn't a huge hit like another 'Something to Remember' track, \\"Take a Bow\\", \\"Rain\\" is one of her best songs. I also love \\"Bad Girl\\", but maybe the tracks were chosen by Madonna or really were based on sales. That would explain why 'Ray of Light's \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is left off and \\"Bedtime Story\\" was included. Interesting. So although my real problem is the lack of new songs, I have no problem with a \\"greatest hits\\" album, and while her 90s work doesn't quite match the giddy charm and fresh irreverence of 'Immaculate Collection', it does highlight Madonna's best moments, such as the mega selling \\"Take a Bow\\", the big comeback singles \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\", the instant classic \\"Music\\", and strenghtening somgwriting in such songs as \\"Drowned World (Substitute for Love)\\" and \\"What it Feels Like for a Girl\\". All I can say is we're just waiting on that nice comprehensive boxed set we're hoping she will one day release.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|All I have to say is I hope John didn't make this album until much later in his career. It would have worked so much better if it was sorta like an underground release or a tribute album. Much is to be admired with daring and baravado to cross over barriers but it's really hard not to get turned-off by the excessive media hype that this lame album of his is getting. It defnitely does not deserve all of the hype it's being showered with right now. And Oh my god not to mention the overtly- obsequious-over-eagerness-to-please article inside the cd sleeve! That writer's mouth sure is stinkin' right now for kissing so much Mayer a$$!<br /><br />If reviewers of this album are saying this is authentic blues/blues-rock, for the love of god pleeeaaaze try to at least give the Allman Brothers Band 4-cd Box Set a thorough listen. The music is so much more thumpin', much more rockin', much more melodious, much more bluezier, and much more importantly, so much more of a gratifying and enjoyable type of music to listen to!!!
B000BJS4SU|1.0|I really wanted to like this album. I really did. John Mayer I thought was pretty decent in his older stuff. And I love the blues and rock etc. So when i heard he was finally letting loose his guitar playing and doing a record like this i was mildly excited. I love the whole jam band concept ...my favorite bands of all time are the 3 piece jam band blues rock types (jimi hendrix experience, band of gypsies, cream, zz-top, etc. ). So that sounded like another plus. So i went to best buy and picked up a copy as soon as i had the money. I eagerly ripped the plastic off and slipped it into my cd player, anticipating the rejuvination of a genre the likes of which i hadnt seen since SRV singlehandedly brought the blues back from the brink of nothingness in the early 80's. I couldnt have been more disappointed, much to my utter dismay. The playing : derivative. The songs : forgettable. The singing : oh no dont get me started on the singing. The band as a whole: no charisma . Where was the spark of greatness i heard all over the recordings of my favorite bands? I searched for it on this record, and i couldnt find it anywhere. I cant tell you how let down i have been. I hate all the garbage music over the airwaves these days and was hoping for so much more from this release, i hoped for good music to be back in style, and im afraid this severely mediocre album is .... unfortunately for those of us who like this kind of music.... not nearly good enough to create the revolution i was hoping for. Dang. Now my only hope is for the Arc Angels to get back together to do another album. Oh well.
B000BVD460|1.0|i'm sort of glad that eminem released this cd full of \\"songs that made him money\\" so you can finally see what eminem is really all about. this is not his greatest hits by any means. he has a ton of great songs, maybe 2 or 3 of them are on this cd. but he's got some classics such as criminal, just don't give a fu--, my fault, and many others which are all better than any song on this cd. it's pretty sad how people are giving this 5 stars when all it is, is the same song over and over. just lose it = real slim shady = my name is = without me ....    i know a lot of people like the song LOSE YOURSELF but how commercial and lame was that song really. guilty conscience and way i am are the only real good songs on here. toy soldiers was a hit for him, and was a very good song sort of, but all in all, these are all repeat songs. same thing over and over and over and over.     and over.    it's pretty sad.     yes, i loved my name is, and yes it should be on his greatest hits, but when he just duplicates it like 5 or 6 times, only one version of it really should be on this cd. pathetic.     cleaning out my closet is probably the most pathetic song on here, he gets very personal and is probably considered by eminem to be one of his greatest songs, but i can't stand listening to people sing it with their friends when they hear it on the radio, or when they chant it at concerts, like they know his personal life or something.    the new tracks are so uninspired, i don't know how they made this list. of course, they probably will make him a lot of money so like all the other songs on this list they will eventually belong. but really here is how eminem's greatest hits should be, in no order.    my name is (the original!)  kill you  (his best song after becoming famous)  just don't give a fff  (his best song before becoming famous)  who knew  (his first christopher reeves mention)  way i am  (just a great song)  criminal  (one of his most clever songs)  07 bonnie & clyde  (very cute, girls love this song)  brain damage (underrated song, but awesome rhymes)  my fault  (another one of the underrated with great rhymes)  guilty conscience (classic, still makes me laugh)  rain man (only good song on encore)  dad's gone crazy (this could be left off, but i love this song)  til i collapse (nate dogg)  when the music stops (this is one of em's best verses)  say what u say (awesome dis track)  superman  (famous song and funny as hell)  hallie's song (the only personal song of his that's even worth listening to)  and maybe put on rap game from 8 mile soundtrack, or just his verse cuz the rest of the song is pretty lame.    so there you have it. my cd is way better than the crap you are giving 5 stars to.    by the way while you're at it, visit the WEST BUURBS site it's [...] for better joints than this one.    later.
B000BVD460|5.0|Let&#8217;s all hope that this isn&#8217;t really the final curtain call for the multi-talented rapper Marshall Bruce Mathers III.  Launched by Dr. Dre, Eminem has stamped his distinctive style all over the rap genre, winning nine Grammies and an Oscar for his innovative beats and flow, and of course his controversial lyrics have kept him in the spotlight one way or the other.<br /><br />This is his fifth album, the first Greatest Hits compilation, and includes three new songs as well as most of his hit singles from &#8220;The Slim Shady LP&#8221;, &#8220;The Marshall Mathers LP&#8221;, &#8220;The Eminem Show&#8221;, &#8220;Encore&#8221; and the &#8220;8 Mile&#8221; soundtrack.  It also includes the live version of &#8220;Stan&#8221; performed at the 2001 Grammy&#8217;s by Eminem and Elton John.  The one omission that comes to mind is &#8220;Superman&#8221;, and also maybe &#8220;Encore&#8221;, but there are enough hits to make most people very happy.<br /><br />The new tracks are &#8220;FACK&#8221;, a funny track that more than earns a PA warning, the infectious &#8220;Shake That&#8221; (featuring Nate Dogg), and one of the best new songs around - &#8220;When I&#8217;m Gone&#8221;.  Lyrics from &#8220;When I&#8217;m Gone&#8221; strongly hint that Eminem may be taking a break to spend more time with his daughter and niece, and he also may be working on expanding his production portfolio.<br /><br />&#8220;What happens when you become the main source of her pain<br /><br />\\"Daddy look what I made\\"<br /><br />Dad's got to go catch a plane<br /><br />\\"Daddy, where's Mommy, I can't find Mommy where is she?\\"<br /><br />I don't know, go play, Hailey baby, your daddy's busy&#8221;<br /><br />This album represents the very best of Eminem, plus a couple of excellent new tracks.

B000BMSTMS|2.0|could have been a good album, but the over-production kills it. korn make good albums when they are raw (Korn, Life is Peachy, Take a Look in the Mirror). Team them up with a slick producer and the life is sucked right out (Issues, Follow the Leader, SYOTOS). i give it 2 stars becasue it's tolerable...but it never gets enough steam.
B00005JOHI|5.0|This is a very intelligent and entertaining movie.  After watching thousands of romantic movies, this one deals with character studies, witty dialogue, and enchanting characters.  It is worth seeing several times.  The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennett, are intriguing and interesting.  They are not one-dimensional like many movies tend to portray their characters.<br /><br />We all have pride.  We all have prejudices.  This movie, as well as the book, deals with these characteristics in an intelligent way to portray love and romance.

B00005JMUA|3.0|I loved Kill Bill. The fight scene with the Crazy 88s goes down in my memory as one of the greatest I've ever seen, and that last battle with Oren was sad and beautiful and incredibly fierce.  I wanted to love Kill Bill 2 but frankly, it just doesn't measure up. It's like Tarantino gave the best of what he had to the first movie and threw in some cold leftovers for the second.  <br /> <br />There is only one good fight scene in Bill 2. When Elle and the Bride get together in Bud's foul little trailer it's a doozy but the audience has to wait a long, long time for it. Here's one small nitpick. Why did Elle introduce Bud to the Black Mamba? I would've preferred to see the Bride get her rematch with him.  <br /> <br />Part of the problem with this moive is that the China scenes should've been shorter and part of it is that Bill is shown too early. It would've been much better we didn't get to see the snake charmer fully until the last chapter. And speaking of the last chapter I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wasn't happy with the incedibly wimpy way things went down with Bill.  <br /> <br />The Bride goes through hell and dishes it out to all the DIVAS and has like five seconds of fight with the Man himself. What a let down! I suspect Tarantino knew he could'nt pull off another Oren/Bride type of triumph so he did a quickie meeting with Bill but that stinks. The audience has sat and waited for this meeting and it doesn't meet expectations.  <br /> <br />Yes, I was happy with the ending and the clever bit of music and last shots of the actors but that final scene with Bill is so bad it destroys the movie. I bought Kill Bill 1 and its soundtrack. I will  not be doing that with Kill Bill 2.
B00079FUI6|5.0|DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES is a definite guilty pleasure. With a great cast and good writing, it's must see TV for me every week. It was nice to get the complete first season and relive all the great moments from season one. The storylines were well written and very enjoyable. Starting with Mary Alice's suicide, it propelled a mystery that spanned the whole season and encompassed the whole cast. Teri Hatcher plays the unlucky in love heroine Susan, who has a daughter Julie from her previous marriage to Karl. Felicity Huffman plays Lynette, mother of four, who struggles with raising her kids. Eva Longoria plays Gabrielle, a rich socialite who is spoiled and married to her husband Carlos, but also having an affair with her gardener John. Marcia Cross plays Bree, the perfect housewife who has to deal with her rebelious son and cheating husband. Nicolette Sheridan plays Edie, the sexy temptress who is fighting with Susan for Mike's affections. The show is well balanced with mystery, comedy, suspense, and drama. Must see TV!
1400031087|5.0|I started reading this book on a Thursday and finished on Saturday.  I have never read a book that fast in my life and I have read several.  In a way, I felt as if I was reading someones medical record and I was invading their privacy.  It was a train wreck and I had to watch.  The first 3 pages grabbed me from the get go.  Wakes up on a plane heading to Chicago, his eyes swollen shut with teeth knocked out and a hole in his cheek. My God, does it get any more graphic than that?  Absolutely.  I had to reread the dentist part because I couldnt believe what he went through.  I highly recommend this book.  Its an eye opener.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The first time I saw Donnie Darko almost 3 years ago, I, like a lot of other people, understand very little about what I had just watched. However despite that fact, I was intrigued and extremely drawn to this movie, even though I didn't quite understand what had just happened. Upon multiple viewings of the movie I have more or less come to my own conclusion or meaning about the plot, which like everyone says, will give you something new every time you watch it. That's the beauty of this film, because no two people are going to come to the same conclusion on what the movie is about. With brilliant direction (kudos Richard Kelly), an excellent (an extremely underrated I might add) cast of characters, and a confusing, yet beautiful story, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is not just another cult film. This is a movie that is timeless.    There are very, very few movies that have been able to capture my attention the way Donnie Darko has, and even fewer have prompted me to view the movie multiple times to actually find more and more out about it. However Donnie Darko is one of those films that the first time through, you may not necessarily understand what is going on. To briefly summarize the plot, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal who gives a phenominal performance) is teenager who has had frequent psychological problems in his life recently, and feels alienated from his family and friends. One night Donnie is awakened by Frank, a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit, who instructs Donnie to follow him. Donnie does, and this ends up saving Donnie's life as a jet engine crashes through his roof that night. Frank informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 Minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie then feels like he must obey Frank who makes him do many questionable things, because Frank saved his life. This includes flooding his local high school and burning down the house of a perverted self help guru. Not only that but it appears that Donnie is slipping in and out of multiple realities, leaving you wondering what are hallucinations, and what is really happening. This ultimately leads Donnie into the research of time travel and tangent universes, which becomes one of the most important aspects of the movie. That should give you a basic idea what the movie focuses around. While this might not sound like the most award winning premise, Kelly definitely turns this into one of the must see movies of our generation.    There are so many themes and underlying messages running throughout this film, and only upon multiple viewings will you truly discover them all. Like I said one of the best things about this film is that everyone is going to draw something different from it. However Kelly has deliberately made the Donnie character one that everyone can relate to. I can honestly say as a teenager I felt almost exactly like Donnie does in the film, and that makes relating to this movie on different levels so easy. There's also a sense that this alienated teenager is in the end the real hero, despite being looked down upon by his peers and his community. The love story between Donnie and Gretchen is exactly what you would expect it to be like between two teenagers who don't necessarily understand what they are feeling at the time. Part of the charm of this movie is its overwhelming honesty and portrayal of things as they are in real life, not glamoured up for hollywood.    Whatever Kelly's intention was when he wrote the movie (which to this day has never been clearly explained), he has made a movie that has touched and connected with a broad audience of people worldwide. It is safe to say that \\"Donnie Darko\\" isn't just a cult film now, it's a worldwide phenomenon. I promise you will never think about things the same way as you do after viewing this film. I strongly encourage you to see this movie. It is definitely something that will stand out from anything you've ever seen. I still don't feel like I have done this movie justice with my review, but I don't really think any review is capable of doing that. To put it simply, you must see this movie. \\"And when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because I know I have so much to look forward to....\\"
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Well it has been some time since we have heard from the fathers of Nu-Metal.  Take A Look in the Mirror was a return to KoRn's Bakersfield roots.  They sounded like they did when LAPD merged with SexArt to form what we know today as KoRn.  Since that album came out some things have changed but for the better.  KoRn has been aruond since 94 and now after 11 (almost 12)years we have a new sound.  This album is alot more indestrual than nu-metal BUT it is still a great album.  If this is where KoRn is going in the future then I saw if your a true KoRn fan then grab on to this album and hold on tightly, for when its all set and done it will be in the top 3 KoRn albums (with but not behind KoRn and Life Is Peachy)
B00003CXA4|5.0|This is one of those legendary films that will surmount it own time. And this is possibly the main feature of the immortal masterpieces, works which acquire an independent life and excel far beyond the crowd of bombastic epithets and remarkable adjectives.<br /><br />Not only it is worthy to remark the visible conviction of his director:Richard Attenborogh, from the initial shots, the splendid script, the superb artistic direction, the sumptuous photography, but I must insist around the performance of Kingsley as Gandhi; he surpassed the levels of the excellence. He became Gandhi; his colossal role broke the barriers of the perfection, that fact produced in the viewer an admirable and few times astonishing perception of sensorial vertigo. The camera achieved the perfect equilibrium between the intimacy and the grandness, eloquence and  transcendence, permeating literally your soul, senses, spirit and intellect.<br /><br />Gandhi was the most prominent mystic leader in the XX Century and his thesis about the non violence still is subject of discussion. The concept of disobey understood as attachment to a majuscule irreverence, reached a status that exceeded by far, the frontiers of the injustice, domination and oppression, getting a supreme feat without just one shot: a sample of how the intelligence is a more effective device than any other weapon.<br /><br />My final advise: after you watch this film go for the famous Robert 'Payne 's biography about Mohandas Gandhi, this apparent single man who said once: \\"The impatient waits twice.\\"
B000BJS4SU|3.0|ive heard better, ive heard worse. this is OKAY music, it didnt make me jump up and take notice, but also it didnt make me vomit. I hope he gets a gutsier on his next album. This was sorta weak in my opinion, singing could defenitely have been stronger, not very bluesy...still very throaty akin to his pop records. Not very suited to the blues. Good effort though. Keep trying mayer, you might do better next time.
0451169514|5.0|I am rather new to reading Stephen King novels, but so far this one has to be my favorite. The book has a little bit of everything and the final product is one of the best novels ever written. King is very descriptive in this novel. You can't help but fall in love with the characters Bill, Ben, Beverly, Stan, Richie, Mike and Eddie because King goes into such depth in developing their characters that you feel like you actually know them. You actually begin to feel as though you are in Derry, Maine with these 7 kids as they battle this evil. While the book is long...it goes very quick, and when it's done you will miss it. I don't want to give away too much info but I will leave it at this. If you want a novel that is filled with great character development and a deep and involving plot, pick this book up and you will be happy you did.
0393317552|5.0|Why humans developed differently? Why Europe, not China, has more wealth? Why whites, not blacks, dominate the modern world? To answer those perennials questions, Diamond searched our 13,000 years history. He found clues in food production, domesticated animals, disease dispersal, migration trends, and language history. He concluded the primary reason for human inequality is the environment, not innate differences in people.<br /><br />Diamond presents broad historical patterns. He starts with farmer power, how more wild plants and animals available for domestication allowed a more dense population, and how the spread of innovative techniques was uneven as movement across continents was easier East-West than North-South. More agriculture allowed denser populations. And more people lead to diseases (and immunization), technology (weapons and writing), and centralized decision-making (religions and governments).<br /><br />Criticism of Diamond's theory revolves around the human factor. But the pundits ignore the subtleties of his theory: interaction with the environment, not geography or biology alone, is responsible for human development. It stems from the conjectures that knowledge is cumulative and complexity creates innovation. Brushing across history and science, Diamond suggests that different environments caused the diversity of human progress and that the past serves as a guide to the future.
1594200696|5.0|Reviewed by Joanna Pearson for Small Spiral Notebook<br /><br />In ninth-grade English, I was introduced to The Elements of Style by William Strunk and E.B. White. Needless to say, this was a while ago, and I've both read and written a few things since then. Nonetheless, just weeks ago I managed to turn in a poem to my writing workshop containing the line, \\"He lifts the ringing culprit in his fingers.\\" My instructor looked at me askance before asking why I hadn't simply written, \\"He answers his cell phone.\\" Oh....Yeah. Clearly for some of us, the reissue of Elements, newly illustrated by Maira Kalman, has come not a moment too soon. Kalman's strange, gorgeous paintings are a treat that will charm readers into rediscovering a book that is as fresh, relevant, and funny as it was back in its first edition.<br /><br />The Elements of Style has always been the original in the way of tart, pithy guides to writing and grammar. Long before Lynne Truss delighted readers with her curmudgeonry in Eats, Shoots & Leaves, there was old Strunk- railing against words like \\"beauteous\\" and \\"utilize,\\" offering such sage advice like \\"Avoid fancy words.\\" By adding her quirky pictures, Kalman is both paying homage to a classic and inviting new readers to discover it. Elements is now a two-fold experience; visual and literary.<br /><br />One has to imagine Kalman as one of those geniuses who lose themselves every morning over their breakfast cereal, constantly struck by ideas-\\"I know, I'll paint about sentence structure! Illustrate a grammar book!\\"-that would sound ridiculous to the rest of us, and yet turn out to be brilliant. In addition to devising this new illustrated Elements, Kalman also commissioned Nico Muhly to compose an opera. Performed recently at the New York Public Library, it was by all accounts crazy yet wonderful, complete with Kalman's friend Isaac Mizrahi playing an eggbeater. We non-geniuses, on the other hand, have probably not considered the idea of singing about words and sentences since the last time we watched Sesame Street.<br /><br />Kalman's ideas work. The new book is a slim, appealing red volume. Gone is the fusty plainness of the ninth-grade classroom. This book is classy. The inside front cover says \\"hello,\\" and the inside back cover says \\"goodbye\\" in tiny cursive script like elegant hostess cards. Almost every other page is illustrated, and the illustrations range from Kalman's interpretation of \\"overly, muchly, thusly\\" (a top-heavy ship-on-land structure) to \\"Chloe smells good, as a baby should\\" (the huge gurgling face of red-headed baby Chloe.) All the pictures are bright, and many of them demonstrate a deliberate absence of compositional depth that seems to be one of Kalman's trademarks. As such, the odd tangle of characters she paints in an illustration like hers for \\"None of us is perfect,\\" seem ready to tumble on top of each other or out of the page. Some of the paintings like \\"What a wonderful show!\\" to me resemble the flurried, brilliant compositions of the painter discovered in the lunatic asylum. Kalman's bright oddness, her weird lines of perspective, have something off-kilter to them, something more often found in outsider-art.<br /><br />If Kalman had illustrated the phonebook instead, it would be worth reading just for the sake of seeing her pictures. In this case, however, in addition to Kalman's illustrations, one has the barbed imperatives of good old Strunk and White to look forward to, like :<br /><br />Nauseous. Nauseated. The first means \\"sickening to contemplate\\"; the second means \\"sick at the stomach.\\" Do not, therefore, say, \\"I feel nauseous,\\" unless you are sure you have that effect on others.<br /><br />and:<br /><br />Muddiness is not merely a disturber of prose, it is also a destroyer of life, of hope: death on the highway caused by a badly worded road sign, heartbreak among lovers caused by a misplaced phrase in a well-intentioned letter, anguish of a traveler expecting to be met at a railroad station and not being met because of a slipshod telegram. Think of the tragedies that are rooted in ambiguity, and be clear! When you say something, make sure you have said it. The chances of your having said it are only fair.<br /><br />It is both his grumpiness in misuse and the genuine joy in clarity that make Strunk a wonderful guide. Strunk saw bad writing as insidious and disruptive, an ever-present trap into which it was easy to slip. Similarly, his view of the precarious position of the reader is observed by White in his introduction:<br /><br />All through The Elements of Style one finds evidences of the author's deep sympathy for the reader. Will [Strunk] felt that the reader was in serious trouble most of the time, floundering in a swamp, and that it was the duty of anyone attempting to write English to drain this swamp quickly and get the reader up on dry ground, or at least throw a rope.<br /><br />All in all, the illustrated Elements of Style is well worth the reader's time-a sturdy rope with which to rescue anyone stranded in a morass of unclear language, whether your own or someone else's. Kalman's bright, dreamy images are persuasive in their own right too. And even if you've never mixed up \\"which\\" and \\"that,\\" misplaced a single comma, nor composed an overwrought line, you should still pick up what remains one of the funniest books on writing ever written.ting to be met at a railroad station and not being met because of a slipshod telegram.

B000BHN7DE|5.0|First things first, Anastacia got the shaft in the US, period.  Why???  Because stupid radio programmers wouldn't add her music to radio playlists here...she is one of a kind, a total original, and radio programmers want dumbed-down, cliche-ridden crap...those people are fearful of the real deal, cuz if Americans ever heard \\"Left Outside Alone\\", they would go nuts.  Now, what gets me is why the heck Sony BMG wouldn't use OTHER avenues to promote her unique brand of music???  They could have still released \\"Anastacia\\" to the American public and used TV or internet promotion???<br /><br />Sheesh...now Kelly Clarkson is having hits with a sound Anastacia perfected...<br /><br />Anyhoo, her masterpiece of a 3rd album was not heard by most Americans so it's pointless to release this GORGEOUS hits collection here...too bad really, as it's got the goods.  The track order shows Anastacia's evolution as a songwriter, singer and all-around artist, starting in a Chaka Khan/Taylor Dayne hybrid soul/dance/pop vein (with some rock, funk and even country touches thrown in), then evolving organically into more of a hard rocker, like an edgy Tina Turner, whilst still maintaining her strength and trademark otherworldly soulful voice intact...<br /><br />The track selection is first rate...where's that DVD though???  Mine didn't have one!!!!!  The hits are in chronological order, the 5 new songs are worthy and nice, mostly ballads, which are fine in Anastacia's hands...that megamix is pretty cool too.  Of the new tracks, I love the new single and title track \\"Pieces Of A Dream\\" the most.  The second remix disc is good to have as well, but I'd much rather have had a disc (or 2) of odds and ends, like B-sides and rarities (she has TONS)...maybe one will come out or I might have to put one together myself.<br /><br />I wonder what it will take for Anastacia to really break her own home market...or is it too late???  It sucks but I don't care, I'll just buy imports...I'm only bummed about not getting to see her live at a NYC club/venue...performing these songs.<br /><br />Oops, almost forgot, the pristine packaging, wow!!!!!!!  Stunning layout and photography, mostly in glorious black + white, with full lyrics interspersed throughout...that alone is worth the price of this package, preferably in the deluxe edition than the jewelcased single disc edition...there, you don't get the remixes either, so it pays to get the deluxe one...ed about not getting to see her live at a NYC club/venue...performing these songs. <br /> <br />Oops, almost forgot, the pristine packaging, wow!!!!!!!

0671027344|3.0|More like a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't give half stars.    When The Perks of Being a Wallflower first came out, even the most dedicated pop culture ostriches had trouble avoiding it.  Chbosky became a folk hero for the awkward, bookish high-school (or, more often, college) student with a penchant for self-doubt.    Perks does, to some degree, live up to the hype, and I can see why so many college-age men and women have fallen in love with it, but it is not the end-all-be-all of wallflower lit. Perks is a story about Charlie, a high school freshman who is very genuine and very honest, and also very passive. Although it seems to be the general consensus among contemporary fiction writers that \\"wallflowers\\" have a simple (not to be mistaken wtih simplistic) way of looking at the world, and Perks is in some ways a very simple book (it's a collection of letters from Charlie to an anonymous \\"friend\\"), it is nevertheless very touching and hints at a number of important issues facing contemporary (read: 1990s, when the book was written) youths and their parents.    Nevertheless, I find its stylistic premise unrealistic. I don't think that someone like Charlie would write letters to a stranger, because someone like Charlie would be paralyzed by the idea that he might be burdening that stranger. Likewise, by placing us fictively in the position of the anonymous \\"friend,\\" Chbosky makes it impossible for us to experience Charlie's world the way that friend would. Because we are informed and recognize from the start that this is to be a book written as letters, and we are to receive them, we are rendered incapable of receiving Charlie's letters. Rather than confidantes, we are voyeurs, and this is the source of our sympathy for Charlie and our delight in his universe.    Further, Chbosky's psychological meanderings in Perks are more than a bit reductionist.  Charlie's entire elaborate persona is dissolved into a single incident involving two people.  Charlie's self-discovery effectively ends this novel, rather than causing him to further explore his own depths.    If participation is key, Perks succeeds admirably.  The reader is drawn in to Charlie's confidence and Chbosky's writing.  I found the book a quick read and an enjoyable one, but surprisingly unchallenging.  Chbosky's approach barely qualifies as a critical one.    Read Perks, but \\"be a filter, not a sponge.\\"  It is limited by the age of its main character.  A more mature take on wallflower life is Steve Martin's Shopgirl.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|I have to weigh in on this ridiculousness that certain reviewers are laying against this CD.  There are several reviews in question do nothing to provide the person reading the review with any insightful knowledge into the product.<br /><br />With that said, This album is a good effort from Madonna. Not Great or Oustanding, but not Poor either.<br /><br />This album is all dance-themed songs.  Madonna wrote and produced all the tracks and experiments with different sounds, samples, licks and beats throughout the album.<br /><br />As with almost all of Madonna's albums since her first 2, her best work, in my opinion, comes in when the remixes of the original songs from her albums hit the dance club circuit.  The remixes of Madonna's songs have always done well in this genre.  Take for instance her Bedtime Story album...Many people felt that Bedtime Story was a weak album for Madonna... until the remixes came out.  I would say the same is true for Confessions of A Dance Floor to a certain extent.  I think the remixes will help support the album.<br /><br />The album does seem to get a little monotone, but I think that's because the beats per minute/tempo of these songs are pretty close to each other for almost all of the album.  Also, the songs do not have definitive beginnings and endings, they blend into each other.  From what Madonna has said about the album, this was intentional to give a consitent vibe to the listener.<br /><br />The material on the album has a decidedly European dance sound.  This is not House, Hip-hop, R&B or Pop by any stretch of the imagination.  Yes, the current single,Hung up,has some Pop radio appeal, but many of the other songs would seem to be geared to being played in discotheques/clubs.<br /><br />With all of that said, this album is certainly not going to compete with an album like Emancipation of Mimi, nor is it meant to in my opinion.  The material on the album is in a completely different genre than Emancipation of Mimi and as such, there really is no comparison between the two, other than the fact that this album and Emancipation of Mimi have been released within a relatively close time frame.  I'm sure this was done to take advantage of the upcoming holiday season and was not planned in any way to compete for the #1 selling album or chart position.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review helps provide some value.  The album is not her best work, it's not her worst work.  The forthcoming remixes will probably be great and if you're into the European dance sound, you'll like this album.mi and as such, there really is no comparison between the two, other than the fact that this album and Emancipation of Mimi have been released within a relatively close time frame.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If Homer's mythical epic \\"The Iliad\\" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic film \\"Troy.\\" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because \\"Troy\\" is an ultra-realistic and serious portrayal of the Trojan war.<br /><br />More than that, \\"Troy\\" is without a doubt the BEST sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- \\"Samson and Delilah,\\" \\"Spartacus,\\" \\"Ben-Hur,\\" \\"Ulysses,\\" \\"The Viking Queen,\\" \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"Attila,\\" \\"The Odyssey,\\" \\"Gladiator,\\" etc. -- \\"Troy\\" is BETTER. Okay, maybe I'm getting a bit carried away here because I just viewed \\"Troy\\" and it blew me away, but \\"Troy\\" is at least AS GOOD as some of the better flicks just mentioned, like \\"Ben-Hur,\\" and far edges out \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Samson and Delilah.\\" As for more recent sword & sandal epics like the overrated \\"Braveheart\\" or \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"Troy\\" utterly blows 'em out of the water -- no lie!<br /><br />Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of \\"Troy\\" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film -- He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film \\"Ulysses,\\" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in \\"Troy.\\" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the ACTUAL Trojan war that Homer's myth is based on (and even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).<br /><br />Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I'm not a major Brad Pitt fan -- I neither love him or hate him -- but I think he does an outstanding and believable job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from \\"Hulk\\") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest man-to-man sword & sandal fight ever filmed -- really!<br /><br />What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful showdown, my wife and I couldn't decide who to root for. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong here, Agamemnon could probably be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks or the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out,... and it never ends,  as Achilles states. An additional point of the film is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.<br /><br />As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionables: Diane Kruger plays Helen, \\"the face that launched a thousand ships.\\" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. Not that I think she's some ultra-ravishing beauty (although she does have a supremely impressive rear-end shot), but she's certainly not plain looking; and, besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder -- if Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.<br /><br />I should point out that \\"Troy\\" is one of the most expensive pictures ever made, close to 200 million dollars, and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, \\"Troy\\" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies,ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding, not fake-looking like the Rome and Coliseum scenes in \\"Gladiator.\\"<br /><br />Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout the flick, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and \\"Everything's beautiful because we're doomed.\\" So don't worry, there's thankfully not one 'humorous,' goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.<br /><br />James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack for \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/appropriate/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.<br /><br />INTERESTING NOTE: Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon while making the film. Fitting, no?<br /><br />FINAL WORD: If you're into sword & sandal epics, \\"Troy\\" will BLOW YOU AWAY. The story captivates you right from the very beginning and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour running time. Beyond this \\"Troy\\" extravagantly visualizes the Trojan war for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.<br /><br />Keep in mind that those who give \\"Troy\\" a poor rating are the same losers who think \\"Jackass -- the Movie\\" is a great film.behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding, not fake-looking like the Rome and Coliseum scenes in \\"Gladiator.\\"     Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout the flick, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and \\"Everything's beautiful because we're doomed.\\" So don't worry, there's thankfully not one 'humorous,' goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.     James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack for \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/appropriate/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.       INTERESTING NOTE: Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon while making the film. Fitting, no?    FINAL WORD: If you're into sword & sandal epics, \\"Troy\\" will BLOW YOU AWAY. The story captivates you right from the very beginning and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour running time. Beyond this \\"Troy\\" extravagantly visualizes the Trojan war for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.    Keep in mind that those who give \\"Troy\\" a poor rating are the same losers who think \\"Jackass -- the Movie\\" is a great film.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|...and still, over a decade later, far from seeming outdated. It takes your breath away, the rhythms, the light show. The flowing sound of some of the best songs ever in the history of rockn' roll. \\"Todays'\\" Pink Floyd has style, so presise and talented -and in my opinion (in this show) better than ever! Thank God Roger Waters left, we'd never had experienced this progress had he still dominated the band. I am a big fan of the Pink Floyd-albums he \\"headed\\" (or had a major influence on that is, and without doubt), but after \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" -well, enough was enough. The way he has critized David Gilmour, accusing him for never coming up with any workable ideas during their \\"creative relationship\\" -he has even called Phil Collins a disaster as an artist. Roger Waters, who are you to talk? I must admit Collins' resent albums are a bit uninspiring, but he is at least a far better musician than you'll ever be. In Floyd Waters was a consept-builder, David Gilmour was (and is) his voice and together with Richard Wright put the sound to Waters ideas (Mason too of course). And what a sound! What would \\"Wish you were here\\" have been without Wrights' tangents? Imagine the sound-picture then. And the title track itself without Gimours' voice and guitar? I usually don't give a damn about people hating post-Water-Floyd, but do not even dare to call David Gilmour a session-player. That was then, in the late 60's! An \\"ok back-up singer\\"? Oh yeah, you know what you are talking about, don't you?? <br /> <br />David Gilmour has, without doubt, the best voice out of the four band members. And what an amazing voice! Do you honestly think that if he didn't have the incredible voice he has the controll-freak of a certain Mr Waters would have even allowed the man to sing? Richard Wright too has a better voice, so please! Waters can't sing, he can write. On his solo-albums he more speaks than sings anyway, and it works on those. But imagine him sing lead on \\"Wish you were here\\" (as an example). I don't think so... But none of that really matters, after Syd the band was blessed with David -and look what happened! Is this band a big failure? As with other more open-minded music-loving revieweres has tried in vein, well, I get in line; Leave Pink Floyd alone, get over it! <br /> <br />Enough of that -finally the dvd is soon to be out on the market, and I repeat; Finally! I have been looking for this for many years now, finally worthy sound and picture. And the extras do anything but ruin the event for sure -enjoy!
0790729652|5.0|There sure is a lot of different perspectives as far as which is the best Batman film.  It is really a matter of taste.  However, my opinion is that this is by far \\"The best\\" film.  When this film first came out in 1989, it was the biggest thing since the original \\"Star Wars\\".  I can still watch this film now in days and \\"Never\\" get tired of it.  Excellent director, great actors, outstanding special effects, and a wonderful soundtrack.  Michael Keaton delivered an outstanding performance as Batman.  If you doubt it, why don't you all watch \\"Beetlejuice\\" and then \\"Batman\\".  You'll see how amazing and versatile Keaton can be.  Nevertheless, I give credit for the new \\"Batman Begins\\" and Christian Bales' excellent work as Batman.  However, it ranks second on my book.<br /><br />Hey, how many of you all remember the cool \\"Diet Coke\\" commercial sponsoring for the opening of \\"Batman\\" in 1989 Hint:  A guy, actor who now plays the part as the new \\"Q\\" in the James Bond films, holding a Diet Coke can with bat wings.  Pretty cool commercial.<br /><br />piece!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|2003's \\"In The Zone\\" is Britney's Fourth studio release, and it is pretty damn good. I personally preferred 2001's \\"Britney\\" but this one is not too bad, and rather impressive.  A collaberation with her idol, four singles, two #1's, and a grammy (for best dance record - \\"Toxic\\") followed, so the results speak for themselves. Even people who were never fans of Britney before said they enjoyed this album purely for the music. Britney also helped co - write Eight of the albums Twelve tracks.  Whereas 2001's \\"Britney\\" showed the beginning of an edgier sound you could call \\"In The Zone\\" the full evolution of that, or a carry-on from \\"Britney\\". The album is very remixed and club ready, so it makes for an enjoyable new ride, and overall turns out to be a great album...If you're a fan of music this album should NOT dissapoint and is a must have for Britney fans.  Below is the Track by Track review.  1. Me Against The Music - Featuring Madonna.  The First single from \\"In The Zone\\". When I first heard this song I didn't really like it, but I was aware it would be a massive hit for Britney. The song seems very club ready and  anyone who likes to go out clubbing should like this song. It is unlike anything she's done before.  It grew on me and i started to enjoy it. 4/5  2. (I Got That) Boom, Boom. - Featuring Ying Yang Twins.  This song is O.K. It is very Bump 'N' Grind, it is very sexual with sexy lyrics and a new sound. Sexy vocals on this track too. She sings it very well, and alluringly. 3/5  3. Showdown.  This song is nothing special. I feel it was too short, and very sexual - nothing wrong with that. It mostly seems like filler and is instantly forgotten when over, but worth a listen or two. 3/5  4. Breath On Me.  I love this song. It is very sexy sounding with heavy breathing and panting and anyone who likes going out clubbing will enjoy this track. This track sounds very commercialised and You can imagine it coming out of a advert for a fragrence of some kind.  Britney's vocals are sexy, and so are the lyrics. \\"Mahogomy is the way to go. Just put your lips together, and blow\\" 4/5  5. Early Mornin'.  This is a rather good track. It was written with Moby, and talks about a girls night out. It sounds very new - wave and fits in well with the album. Good club track. However the \\"Jason Nevis Remix\\" on \\"B In The Mix\\" is much better. 3/5  6. Toxic.  Everyone knows this one. This is the second single from the album, and it's first number one. I bought the album after the first single was released, and when listening to this one i thought nothing special of it.I thought it was just filler, But Boy was i wrong. This has to be one of Britney's biggest hits since \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" The video helped promote this song, and once i realised it was single material it grew on me. 4/5  7. Outrageous.  This track was written by R.Kelly. This became the fourth single from the album, and a short clip of the video was featured on the \\"My Prerogative: Greatest Hits DVD.\\" It sounds very hip - hop and sexual, but it is a fun track. 4/5  8. Touch Of My Hand.  This song is more sensual then sexual, like some of the other tracks on the album. Highly Sexual tracks on the album include \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Boom, Boom\\".   The lyrics are very sexy. \\"I'm not ashamed of the things that i dream. I find myself flirting with a verge of obscene\\".  \\"Another day without a lover. The more I come to understand, the touch of my hand\\" The song sounds very Asian. Chinese strings are used in it, and it is a very mature track, and calming to listen to. \\"The Bill Hamel Remix\\" from \\"B In The Mix\\" is a good version of the song, so if you enjoy the original album version check that one out. 4/5  9. The Hook Up.  When I first head this song i thought it was too wild, and didn't like it, but when i heard it a couple of times i started to enjoy it. It sounds Jamaican and you feel like you are on a Caribbean island when listening to it. It has the back up vocals of a Jamaican man in it. Great party song. 5/5  10. Shadow.  This is another sensual track on the album. It is a rather Beautiful and haunting ballad. It talks about a lover whose prescense is felt, but seems as if they are far away, and are missed. This was a pretty enjoyable song. 4/5  11. Brave New Girl.  This song talks about Britney's reinvention and letting go of your fears in life, starting it fresh and enjoying yourself. Good track to play when feeling good. It sounds more Candy Hip-Hop than anything else on the album and any Britney fan will find it enjoyable. 4/5.  12. Everytime.  Up until this track \\"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" had been Britney's most personal and beautiful song. Britney wrote this song and Guy Sigsworth produced it. The result is her most Beautiful song yet. It is very haunting, but listen to it when you are low and it will cheer you up. This was the third single from \\"In The Zone\\" and second #1. (Not Surprisingly.) Even though I enjoyed \\"Britney\\" as an album better this ballad is her best and one of her best songs. It is very deep sounding and offers a gleam of beauty in a world where today's music is very shallow. This track was my favourite on the album. 5/5  I hope Britney continues to make music like this in the future.  Buy the European version of this album for two bonus tracks.   \\"The Answer\\" and \\"Don't Hang Up\\"
B000002AH7|5.0|This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best.  The notes on this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than anything I've ever heard.  The composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense.  Don't let the thirty second clips fool you.  I almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading.  I took a chance on it, and it was the best gamble I've ever made.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast.
B000929AJQ|3.0|It seems to me like he's trying to recapture some retro flavor in this release.  The way it's recorded and the sound he's going for sounds kind of 80's retro.  I just don't like this as much as earlier NIN releases because each one seemed to move forward and take unique directions.  Because of all of these groups right now that are trying to recapture the 80's sound it just doesn't sound as unique as a NIN release should be.  Get the new Skinny Puppy CD instead.  That sounds pretty unique in comparison to this and that's one of Trent's major influences anyway.
0761944524|5.0|This book is a must for any graduate student in the behavioral sciences. Field talks about Stats in English...What a concept. Additionally, the examples he has in the book are appropriately challenging (not like the really simple examples in other books that leave you guessing when a real world question is asked). This has to be my favorite book and I have purchase a good number of Statistic books.  <br /> <br />This book also has a new feature beyond the 1st edition. He shows you how to WRITE about statistics. I wish I had this book when I was working on my thesis... Again, Must have.
079283318X|5.0|Pierce Brosnan does an awsome job in in roles as James Bond. Goldeneye his first Bond movie along with Izabella Scorupco, Judi Dench, Samantha Bond, Famke Janssen, Joe Don Baker, and many more awsome acting in this Bond movie makes you just say this is the perfect cast. The beginning is the best with Bond in the \\"russian weapons facility\\". This is just the best Bond movie ever; I dought their will ever be a better since Pierce Brosnan is gone.
B00005JNJV|5.0|They finally got Batman right.  The other Batman flicks gave you a brooding, dark vigilante, but they never told you how he got that way.  This movie does.    The title actually explains it all.  From the senseless murder of Bruce Wayne's parents through all the training he went through and why he donned the cowl.  Sounds boring, doesn't it?  Well, it isn't.  The story is very well told and kept me engaged throughout.     I guess this was the movie where you could actually sympathize with Bruce Wayne.  You get to know the tortured man behind the mask.  This wasn't so much a \\"Batman\\" movie as it was a Bruce Wayne movie, at least in the first half of it.    This isn't just a good comic book movie, this is a good movie period.  There's a plot to keep you riveted and plenty of action too.  You even get to see how Batman got his hands on all his toys, not to mention why he decided on a bat for his emblem.    For comic book officionados, I'll say that this story isn't canon (you comic folks will know what I mean).  I think they tried to get away from maniacal or cartoonish bad guys (joker, penguin) and went with one that was more recent in the Bat World (I'm not telling who the bad guy is) but was on the more reasonable side.    It's the best Batman movie because it's a story with a comic book hero in it and not a comic book story on the screen.    At the end, all I could say was \\"WOW!\\"    Only one warning.  The batmobile is cool, but it sure isn't what you're used to.     Added note:  I've been reading other reviews that state that Michael Keaton was the best Batman.  Please stop.  You're cracking me up.  Yes, I saw it.  Geez!    As for the lack of humor: IT WASN'T SUPPOSED to be a comedy or a satire.  You've learned about Batman through the Burton/Shumaker films, evidently  You want to understand The Batman?  Read the comics and graphic novels.
B000BVEKO0|1.0|Well, alright, let's blame it on the critics.  KoRn have emerged into the world of metal (or n-metal, depending on how you like to think about it) with great albums, they have flopped once with Issues and managed to make up for it with albums like Untouchables and Take A Look In The Mirror, which was considered by many to be the closest thing to Life Is Peachy, one of their greatest albums of all time.  Then they released their Greatest Hits CD (oh, Vol. 1... which I now doubt there will be a second one), and it included most of their greatest hits (Thoughtless excepted) and a few crappy covers... but hey, you know, it happens. <br /> <br />But now, my friends, I think that's it for KoRn : they're definitely stuck in the s**thole for good.  This album is the grossest attempt I have ever heard from KoRn... this is even worst than Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish.  The causes : well, ok, Head did leave the band, taking an important part of the authentic KoRn sound with him, so that might explain part of it, but honestly, I think it's the critics.  For a while now, especially since they released Take A Look In The Mirror, a lot of people, even unloyal KoRn fans, have accused KoRn of not evolving, of keeping the same style and blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda.  Way to go, look what you've done now!  KoRn tried so hard to do something different that they ended up throwing away all the greatness that used to characterize their style and made it unique. <br /> <br />I still gave it a 1 star (and even if 0 was an option, I would've given it a 1) because there is a wicked song on that album, and a few \\"not bad\\" ones.  Liar is amazing.  Jon brings back the gibberish, lets out his intensity (not at its max, but it's better than nothing) for this one song that is the only element of redemption this album contains.  A few others I can tolerate (Love Song, Coming Undone, Tearjerker).  Oh yeah, Tearjerker I can also give a lot of credit too... pretty intense, an interesting initiative from KoRn... congrats.  But honestly, download those 4 songs and nevermind the rest.  Listening to this album from beginning to end was plain torture for me.  I even gave it a second listen, and then a third one, but then I decided that I didn't want to be a martyr for the rest of my life.  So here it is.  I just want to spare you a waste of your precious time and money.  I guess all great things come to an end.  They did their time... Jon said it best.  R.I.P. KoRn.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is definitely Madonna's best album since \\"Ray of Light\\".  From track 1 to the end, it's a great dance anthem album.  I was in a club and they played the album from start to finish the weekend before it hit the street!  Everyone was out on the dancefloor!   <br /> <br />Standout tracks are: \\"Get Together\\", \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Push It\\", and \\"Like It or Not\\".

B00005JMUA|3.0|If you are a real fan you'll know that this is not the best he's done.<br /><br />Submitting to the pressures of Hollywood film making, Quentin has strayed from his edgy, pushy, shocking classics like Dogs, Pulp, True Romance, and From Dusk...<br /><br />To those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, please see this film!  It will introduce you to the best film maker of the last 25 years.  To those of you who disagree with me, see Sergio Leone and Alan Parker.  See James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart in a new light.  See Lucio Fulci.
6305291446|5.0|I just can't get enough of this movie! For a gore film I think it has a pretty good story line. Basically this film continues on with the story of Michael Myers trying to kill Laurie Strode (Jamie lee Curtis). In this movie, unlike most in it's genre, everything happened for a reason. I found this refreshing, because normally pepole get kiled just for the sake of it. Any fan of the \\"Halloween\\" movies would like this one.
B00019GG1M|5.0|I used to be into pop. And while a lot of people I know who like pop also like this album, it really changed something about me. <br />I needed the distorted guitars, so I bought a 12 Stones album. Then I just kept going up a step, and up and up, and now I'm into metal and hardcore. But it all started here. <br /> <br />This is still a good album. <br /> <br />THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT EVANESCENCE: Amy Lee actually has a good voice, the band can play instruments, Amy doesn't have to dress like a slut to sell music, she doesn't use language in any of the songs (except \\"Thoughtless, which is a Korn cover)they cover spiritual issues which some consider to be \\"Christian\\", and they can just write really good stuff. <br /> <br />THE QUESTIONABLE STUFF: They're not \\"true\\" goth, the word \\"bleeding\\" is too overused, some of the songs sound the same, I expected the album to be darker than it was, and they try too hard to prove that they're not a Christian band while they're practically inviting the title. <br /> <br />But they still have a thumbs up from me. \\"Tourniquet\\" is my favorite song on the album, cause it helped me through a rough time. But it was originally done by a death metal band called Soul Embraced. I downloaded the song, and it sounds so...uh...different. It's a guy growling it basically. Would probably scare you teeny girls, so listen to this version first. I also really like \\"Imaginary\\" cause it has a lot of different instruments in it, and it has pretty verses, and a cool bridge with a choir. I basically like all the songs, but these two I like the best. <br /> <br />I originally got this on my fourteenth birthday with my birthday money, and by my fifteenth birthday had mananged to break it. So I rebought it, and guess what? It had a bonus track! The \\"My Immortal\\" which I really liked was magically on the end of the album. So I guess I got something out of spending a whole 'nother fifteen bucks for a CD I previously owned. <br /> <br />If you don't have Originalready, you need to download it. The songs on there, in my opinion, are better than these ones. There are tons of covers they did on Limewire too. And a bunch of songs that aren't even on Origin. <br /> <br />Peace out.
0790744295|5.0|Ah... Creepshow. If I were to describe Creepshow in one word I would say;\\"Excellent\\". Although I have discovered that many of my \\"friends\\" dislike the movie (they consider it stupid). It all depends on your taste. If you're like me and like ridiculous movies then you would like Creepshow.<br /><br />Basically, Creepshow is a comic book that comes to life. There are five stories(six if you count the opening story). My favorite stories are \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verell\\" and \\"The Crate\\". To this day I still belive that \\"The Crate\\" is by far the scariest. \\"Jordy Verell\\" is awesome because, Stephen King is the star. I think he is hilarious. Basically, he plays a stupid bumpkin. One segment I wouldn't recommend people who dislike bugs to watch is the last one (\\"They're creeping up on you\\")<br /><br />DVD FEATURES:<br /><br />The transfer is not the best, but I rarely notice. The transfer shouldn't hold you back from buying the DVD. Although it only has the theatrical trailer,it does come with both widescreen and full screen format on the same disk, which makes it better than VHS.<br /><br />In conclusion,I think Creepshow is a fantastic movie and if you haven't seen it you should give it a try. \\"That's the ticket!\\"
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Before I start I would just like to share my disappointment in many of the below reviews who base their judgement on the album on Mariahs persona or on her record companies policites instead of on the music. <br />This is a great album full of classic Christmas songs and is already in itself a classic. I already owned the original version of the album and loved it. Now I generally dont like to re-buy albums but the DVD on this is so good that it is well worth it. <br />You get Mariahs classic song All I Want For Christmas Is You plus her fantastic renditions of O Holy Night, Silent Night, Joy to the World and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. The album as a whole is very seasonal and will appeal to any generation. <br />As for parents worried about the DVD contents, they need not be. They are very innocent and you will not find one scene of Mariah in a short skirt. <br />Just to conclude I own many Mariahs albums, old and new, but this one is my favorite.
B000C1YL1G|5.0|i think this was one of the best greatest hits i have heards besides 2pacs. The only problem with this is the song Just Lose It. He has better songs than that which should have been on the cd. I think Bad Guys Always Die ft Dr Dre would have made a great addition to this collecton
B000C1YL1G|1.0|\\"FACK\\" is Eminem's absolute worst song ever written. Period. Is is self-indulgent and idiotic and entirely without value. It's more of his \\"Rain-man\\" music, designed to make HIM giggle as he offloads his lamest, laziest rhymes on a public that he DESPISES, simply because he KNOWS we will buy it. Can't you tell that he HATES US?!? Just listen to \\"Big Weenie\\" (Encore) for proof. WHY ARE WE PAYING THIS JERK* TO INTENTIONALLY INSULT US?!?! <br /> <br />\\"Shake That\\" is a song without soul. Pointless, uninspired, un-danceable, no memorable lines. Not innovative in ANY way. Then again, you probably guessed that from the title. <br /> <br />\\"When I'm Gone\\" is another of Eminem's obligatory \\"Gee, I sure do love Hailey!\\" songs that has begun to draaaagggg after so many albums. In this one he talks at length about his guilt over not spending enough time with Hailey, in favor of writing and performing, which he just can't seem to get away from. Toss in the requisite suicide threats and his wholly depressing commentary on Kim, and you've got the same d*mn song you've heard 5 times now. Eminem, either pull the trigger or go home to your daughter - YOU'RE JUST WASTING YOUR TIME NOW. You've LOST YOUR GAME ENTIRELY, and you embarass yourself every day you stick around here.  JUST GO HOME!!! <br /> <br />*Jerk, in this instance, is a euphemism for something much worse, which Amazon might not allow. Fill in the blank.
B00000055E|5.0|Why do Amazon randomly delete reviews, there was nothing wrong with my previous review, and in fact the guy above me actually used a whole paragraph of my old review for himself!<br /><br />This is the best compilation of posthumous Tupac songs, there are some serious classics on here, how some of these missed the cut for Strictly 4 my Nig*az and 2Pacalypse Now, i don't know.  My favourites include the title track, I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto (with the verse they recycled for Changes), Hold On Be Strong, Do For Love, Fake A*s Bit*hes, Hellrazor, Lie To Kick It etc...  Probably the track he goes deepest on is Only Fear Of Death, which is another eerie track in which Pac predicts his early death.<br /><br />This album is nothing like his other posthumous releases, the beats are as he intended and most importantly no one has messed around with his lyrics (Eminem).  He may not have considered these tracks to be worthy of release when alive, but there are still many gems on here, highly recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Great Album from start to finish. Mezmerize/Hypnotize is one of the strongest duo albums ever released and every song on this album delivers. System of a Down is proving they are here to stay and make a name for themselves if not already. Look for System of a Down to be nominated for several grammies on their performances on these two album. Great System of a Down tunes. If you like this i recomend Steal this Album or Hypnotize.
B000301YY8|5.0|I recently had the opportunity to see James Blunt in concert, as he was opening for Jason Mraz. Having heard of him from another source a few months ago, I ended up being one of the only people in the room who knew who he was.  <br />His songs are heart-wrenching, and that's the only way to describe them. At the concert, while waiting for the inherently bubbly Mraz to take the stage, somebody in the audience yelled for Blunt to sing something \\"happy.\\" But personally, I don't think \\"happy\\" is in Blunt's repertoire. James Blunt is someone you listen to when you feel like...feeling sad. His voice is heartbroken, his lyrics are heartwrenching, and he has a pretty good reason to be depressed, if you ask me.  <br />Overall, his songs have such depth and beauty to them that evoke emotions, unlike many popular artists of the day. If you are looking for a artist with deeply philosophical lyrics and a background to match, Blunt is your man.
B000062YAZ|3.0|Slayer fans are great!!! They are some of the most loyal fans in the world. The fact that you will hear people yelling \\"Slayer\\" at any metal concert (and at non-metal shows) never gets boring. However, and let's be honest, they are not the end all be all of Metal.  <br />RIB is a good album. Angel of Death and RIB are classic tracks. The rest are ok. However when I read that King and Hanneman are great guitarists, it makes me laugh. They write GREAT evil sounding riffs, but thier solos are an absolute joke. Listen to the Beastie Boy's \\"No Sleep to Brooklyn\\" and you hear every single Kerry King solo ever performed. They are all the same.  <br /> <br />Lombardo is an absolute animal behind the kit. He by far is the best muscian in the band. If you appreciate good drumming there are not many out there better, <br /> <br />Personally I think Seasons in the Abyss is a better album. It goes deeper than two songs and has more melody and deepness to the tracks. <br /> <br />To all the people giving reviews that bash Metallica for being sell-outs, they are. And yes, it has been about 15 years since they put ourt an album that is worth buying. But who cares, thier first four albums are all amazing and you all sound like a bunch of band wagon riders, riding the \\"I hate Metallica\\" bus, when if you were even alive in the 80's you know you bought every Metallica album the day they came out. And yes Master of Puppets is a superior album to Reign in Blood.  <br /> <br />In closing, RIB is a good album and it should be in every metal heads collection. However if you are new to Slayer, buy Seasons in the Abyss first. If you like that go back and get RIB and South of Heaven. There is however no denying the influence Slayer has had on the Metal scene and bands that were spawned from thier music.
0684800713|3.0|For the life of me, I don't understand why this is considered a classic.  I've thoroughly enjoyed every other Hemingway novel, but \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" bored me to tears.<br /><br />I get it; Jake is Hemingway.  It's autobiographical.  Brett (Lady Ashley) is the near-perfect woman, able to seduce any man.  I get it.  Jake is either a gelding or has been, in a way, castrated.  I get it.  This causes a ton of trouble.  Once again, the point is clear.<br /><br />Bull fight, drinks, walking and talking, sexual tension, relationships, a possibly scuffle, eating, Spain...wash, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />On the other hand, the prose, the sentence structure, the choppiness, the story flows in classic Hemingway style.  The dialogue keeps the book relatively short, and the characters are very well developed.  Beautifully written.<br /><br />It's just a boring story is all.
B000AP04FG|1.0|It is a shame that a great talent like Brad Pitt is teamed up in a mumble dialogue with Angelina Jole. This movie has absolutely no plot or story line. The action scenes are just noise and have no sequencing that even resembles a believeable scenario. After watching Brad in \\"Troy\\", it was hard to believe this is the same actor. His movie partner is an actress? They tried to base this movie as a comedy, but nobody is laughing. Don't waste your money, even if it is a \\"pre-owned\\" DVD.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|The 'road', as an open highway to emotional oppurtunity, is a glistening blue and gray effect in Vincent Gallo's notoriously criticized, \\"The Brown Bunny\\", the portrait of an eccentric lone wolf who packs up his motorcycle in the back of his van and travels from New Hampshire to California. As a road picture, it seduces the viewer to kick back and comfortably watch the winding highways and impending horizon, despite the genuine nutcase driving the van. Singer-songwriter, Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Beautiful\\", becomes a crackling, cheery and upbeat ode to love, through the bug splattered windshield, in one perfectly pristine scene. I could have driven for hours, but by the time he reaches California, and the infamous oral sex scene, with a nearly comical (and egotistical) stunt-male organ, things get a bit, um, tasteless. Our hero's delusions turn out to be not very complex, and the significance of a flashback detailing his history, amounts to a character study the equivalent of a criminal and psychotic mind on network TV. As for the symbolism of the brown bunny, (there actually is a brown rabbit in the film), I fear it goes no further than a geometric shape children might see in the commode.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|After five years, I figured Enya had thrown in the towel, so I was so excited with this new release.  I've had the CD for about five days, and already five songs stand out that I really love.  Two more I like a lot, and the others I think are O.K.  That's great, when you consider most CDs have only one or two songs worth listening to.  I rarely buy a CD anymore, I usually will buy the songs I like for my mp3, but buying an Enya CD is worth the money.  I hope we don't have to wait another five years for the next one.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|First off i have to say that i was kinda worried about this album since the departure of former guitarist \\"head\\", and only \\"Monkey\\" left to come up with the riffs, but i was totally shocked and surprised of how much better this album was then when they had two guitarists. This album is everything from Follow the Leader to Untouchables. Korn weren't trying to go back to the old formula by just making \\"HEAVY\\" music. Instead they did what they felt was right, and it all worked out better than i could've expected. See you on the other side is without a doubt my favorite album by korn. It's more dynamic than take a look in the mirror and other albums. They still bring the heaviness that i have loved since the beginning, but they have done something different and unique with this one. If you like Follow the Leader and Untouchables then you will really enjoy this album. Oldschool fans will enjoy this record as well. It has something for everyone.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I went to the Pulse tour in 1994 (in Philly) and came away breathless.  I remember thinking the opening song was cool, but didn't know what it was at the time.  Now I know it was Astronomy Dominae.  Did they drop this from the DVD?  I don't see it on the listing anywhere.  It is on the Audio CD.  If they dropped it, that's a bummer, because it sounded awesome at this concert compared to the studio version (which is a little slow for me).  Anyway, please respond if you know anything about this.  Thanks.<br /><br />BTW, no point in complaining about which version of PF you don't like.  Even if you are all pro-Waters, this concert was still amazing.  They're all amazing musicians.  I'm jealous of all of them!  :)  Rush is the only other band I can think of that has me so captivated for an entire concert.<br /><br />Can't wait for this DVD to come out...
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I have a confession to make, I am no longer a die hard Korn fan. Honestly, they lost me on Take a Look in the Mirror. It was one of those instances where your dad was trying to be cool in front of you and fell flat on his face. I figured after the fallout with Epic, Korn would merely become a band that released something independently every so often. Boy was I wrong...They end up signing a monumental contract with EMI/Sony. Back to the band, I honestly have always liked Korn in their most experimental releases, Issues and Untouchables. So obviously, See You on the Other Side is another album in that direction.<br /><br />First off, anyone waiting for another self titled or Life is Peachy, grow up! This band tried to be that 22 year old immature band again with Take a Look in the Mirror and it flopped big time. Now Korn takes a shot at electronics in their new album. They might take a page from Nine Inch Nails but they don't rip out the book if you know what i mean. \\"Twisted Transistor\\" has given the band more ridicule than Metallica with St. Anger. It is easily not one of their best songs but the beat is enjoyable nonetheless. The highlight of the album goes to \\"Hypocrites\\" which follows that Korn kind of crunchy guitar while also perhaps taking punches at particular person with religious beliefs *gee I wonder*. So far, it is the highlight of the album, in my opinion.<br /><br />The other thing one should know before buying this album is that this is not a heavy album by Korn standards. There are perhaps 3 to 4 songs that have that grinding flow that Korn performs so well. The introduction to production and co writers The Matrix has made the songs much tighter and has left the album with a lot less filler. Sadly enough some filler still makes it through.  \\"Throw Me Away\\" can leave you doing just that and Getting Off's descriptive nature isn't much to brag about either. The album's finale, \\"Tearjerker\\", also takes away from a climatic could be finale in \\"Seen It All\\". Seen It All is perhaps the pinnacle of Korn's new direction. With a Faith No Morish atmosphere mixed with Jonathan Davis's inner demons, this song explains all that the band should live up to be.<br /><br />The bandmembers in particular all have their flaws and highlights in the album. Jonathan Davis for the most part has traded in his trademark growls for a more melodic voice. However, on \\"Liar\\" and \\"For No One\\" Jonathan still shows that he can carry on in screaming. Munky is perhaps the shining star of the album partly because he is no longer a co-star with departured guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch. His effects use on guitars have only gotten tighter and stronger since Untouchables. Fieldy gets to spread his wings as hell with new groovy bass driven beats that the band and The Matrix conjured up. David finally decided to join the crowd and use double bass drums which only makes him more lethal on the heavier tracks. For the first time in a long time, David performed excellently.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're looking for crazy blast beat death metal cd, I suggest you stick to Malevolent Creation and Nile. Yet, if you can also appreciate that a mainstream band has the pride in themselves to experiment then this CD is for you. There are heavier and better bands out there believe me, but Korn will forever have a place in my CD collection as the stepping stone into heavy music.<br /><br />P.S. *Get the deluxe edition, it features B-sides that bring you back to a heavy grooving Korn*s perhaps the pinnacle of Korn's new direction.

0385338686|5.0|Sophie Kinsella takes you on a journey in each book she writes.  You feel like you can relate with her characters.  In this book Samanatha is a lawyer who runs away after a large mishap at her office.  Which takes a nice twist at the end of the book (read it to find out ;)) And ends up working for a family as their maid although she knows nothing about being domestic.  She makes you laugh with her antics and feel sad when her life is not going where she feels it should.  And makes you smile with her love with the gardner Nate.  A wonderful book that sucks you in until the last page.  If you love her other books you will love this one too!
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin are the greatest thing that has happened to the human race. They destroy everything else. As soon as I can afford it I might try to listen to another band but there's no way another band coud possibly be as good as the God like Zeppelin. . When someone asks me who the greatest band is I'll say \\"Zeppelin\\" in 0.000000000000000000000000000001 seconds. Other bands are meaningless. I don't need to listen to other bands. Zeppelin is god and how can anything be better than god?
B000002KOG|5.0|[FIVE YEARS LATER: POSTSCRIPT 9/10/10: It was arrogant of me to presume to \\"tell\\" people what this song is about. I don't know why I started off the review the way I did. Obviously I should have said \\"My personal interpretation of the song is....\\"]    Original review follows....  For people who don't know what this song's about, it's actually a song voicing conservative opinions, which Neil reiterated in the 80s and also nowadays. In this song he is hitting out against lack of integrity or resilience by authorities (\\"the preacher took his bible and laid it on the stool - with the congregation running why should I play the fool\\") and homogeneity in society and multiculturalism (\\"there was an Indian in the corner trying on my clothes\\", and \\"the servicemen were yellow...\\") In this new era, this new society, Neil says \\"if you ever need a ride there be sure to let me know....no, no, NO!\\" The rest of the lyrics voice similar sentiments.    Similarly, in the song \\"Here we are in the years\\", Neil rails against environmental degradation (we \\"people planning trips to stars allow another boulevard to claim a quiet country lane; it's insane\\"!)    Neil Young is surely the most underrated performer of rock/pop music, even acknowledging his enduring very high esteem. The sheer integrity and beauty of his songs (melody, lyrics but much more importantly overall souind/spirit) cannot be praised enough.  (By the way, note that a good proportion of his songs relate to motion...)
038533348X|4.0|Let Vonnegut plunge you into the dark realm of scientific progress. Meet Felix Hoenikker, a scientist who cares little for the consequences of his breakthrough research on humanity. Discover how his creation, ice-nine, affects those around him. Imagine the impact of merely a single drop of ice-nine that can cause oceans of water molecules to freeze irreversibly.  <br /> <br />Through Vonnegut's often aberrant and whimsical text, he manages to depict humankind's search for happiness, while using humor, wit, and cynicism to explore morality, the absurd, religion and mortality. This is a story about creativity and the power of science; and at the same time it is a pessimistic look at the fate of humankind, a stupid and vicious race.  <br /> <br />You will adore Vonnegut's catchy chapter titles and quirky characters, but may grapple with trying to relate seemingly disconnected chapters. References to oblivion and abyss emphasize the idea of emptiness and remind us that we are all wanderers, with regrets and lost questions, clinging to our souls.  <br />
B000002MP2|4.0|This is true green day,unlike the recent over-rated american idiot, this album is actually worth a listen,simply for songs like:Basket case and When I Come Around. <br />Since this album i have also bought \\"nimrod\\".Though i didn't find nearly half as good as this, the greatest green day album released to date. <br />I would probably also reccomend \\"International superhits\\" as it contains some cool tracks.  <br /> <br />
B000BMSTMS|1.0|this album was bad, so bad i just had to register to explain how bad this album is.  I had very low expectations for this album, the biggest news surronding this release was their new deal with virgin records (woohoo).  Jonathan davis sounds absolutley awful, his lyrics could have easily been written by any emo high school kid you would see on myspace.  The guitars on this album sound the same, korn is truely dead and this album just proved it. No doubt all the blind korn fanboys will eat this up, while their original fanbase has long since moved on.  Truely sad attempt from korn.
B00005JOMY|5.0|I just had a blast watching \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\".  <br />Robert Downey Jr is so funny as the actor who pretends to be detective. And Val Kilmer is perfect as Gay Perry. I think its the best role he has ever done.  <br />These two actors made the perfect team ! <br /> <br />The Screenplay and writing are fast paced, and comical. The writers know just when to really go over the top. Some of the scenes made me laugh harder than I have at any movie in a long time. <br /> <br />Very rarely do I enjoy dark humor. And very rarely do I see a movie twice. But I enjoyed this film so much, I am thinking of going back and seeing it again. It was that funny.
0143034901|4.0|Wow, this was an addictive read. I had heard great things about this novel from customers in the book shop where Iw orked, and I finally sat down this weekend to read it. I must say, I had trouble putting it down, even when I looked at my alarm clock and realized that it was four in the morning, and I had to be at work in four hours.<br /><br />Zafon has earned comparison to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but this is common for authors who write novels with any hint of mysteriousness in the plot who write in Spanish, and I found his style to be unique and refreshing.<br /><br />My comlaints are few, but large enough to dock one star from an otherwise great novel. First of all, the translation is extrememly weak. In the first fifty pages or so, I counted three idiomatic Spanish expressions that do not make sense translated literally into English, but for which there are appropriate English phrases, that were translated literally into English, and this was quite annoying. The prose was very wooden at times, and in the context of this novel, with its riveting storyline, I felt that I had to agree with Pablo Neruda: If you are going to translate a work, you shoudl improve upon it - or at least capture the poetic nature of the language and not just the words.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, however, is that after 400 pages of loose ends in the plot, the author resolves all of them with a 100 page letter from one of the characters. This was lame. I really feel that Zafon, having constructed such a beautiful story up until this point, had the capability of artfully tying up all of these lose ends with the in the storyline itself. This smacked of pure laziness of the part of the author. I would have gladly read another 300 pages of this novel, good as it was, if that is what it took to tie up these lose ends.<br /><br />Other than that, this was a great read. Highly recommended.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I saw Michael's PBS special two nights ago and I was completely blown away. I've heard of his name before (He did commentary on VH1's I Love The 80's), but I never heard his music or seen him perform. Now I know what I've been missing. This guy is amazing!! He takes Standard and classic songs, and puts a new sound to them. After seeing this special I of course I had to run out and buy the CD/DVD \\"Caught in the Act.\\" This performance if fantastic from the first note to the very last. I love the interaction he has with his audience. The PBS special didn't show him going into the audience to greet his fans, I thought that was really cool. This guy is funny, he has a great personality, easy on the eyes and of course has an AMAZING voice, all that comes out on the DVD. His renditions of these Standards gives me a whole new appreciation for this type of music. He did a little interview with PBS and he talked about bringing in a new sound to these songs for a new generation. I couldn't agree more. Many people (myself included) thought these songs were for the older generation, boy was I wrong. I've since downloaded his 1st  two albums, and I'm still in awe. He covers Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee, then goes to Queen and George Michael! It's obvious he has a great appreciation for many different types of music and that reflects his own music. My only criticism of this package is that five songs on the CD are not on the DVD. PBS showed \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and that was a highlight for me, but it's not on the DVD. On the flip side of that, only three songs from the DVD are on the CD, I would've really loved it if Maroon 5's \\"This Love\\"was on the CD. Other than that, the package is Great. I've already started my campaign to get my friends to listen to Michael's music. I can see him having a long career. Buy this CD/DVD, you wont regret it. <br />
B000BVD460|2.0|There are many stupid songs off this album. How is Just Loose it on this album and songs like Bad meets Evil or gone. Whats up with the stupid song with Nate Dogg. I want to see Dre Beats which is freestyle rhymes of raps. Stupid tracklistings
0064407667|4.0|By my title, you may have guessed that this review is of the entire Series of Unfortunate Events as opposed to simply being about the first volume. Or, rather, it is a review of volumes 1-12 and the Snicket biography, as volume 13 has not yet been released, a phrase which here means that \\"Snicket has written it and is waiting until everyone desperately needs to buy it before he sells the book.\\" I mention it both for your understanding, and also to warn of the very possible spoilers contained below. <br /> <br />Is it dangerous to review the series prior to the last installment's arrival? Perhaps--but in truth, the first twelve books are so similar to one another that it's hard to imagine the thirteenth straying very far. <br /> <br />Similar? Similar isn't even precisely the word that applies, here. The Series of Unfortunate Events feel, rather, that they've been taken from the same cookie cutter, or perhaps a Mad Lib. To wit: the Baudelaire orphans are placed in some well-meaning fool's custody. The wicked Count Olaf, hot after their inherited fortune, insinuates himself into their lives in some manner easily recognizable by the orphans, but utterly convincing to the lack-wits who guard them. The orphans are separated from their guardians, often through fatal means, and fall into the villain's clutches. By some device which incorporates the three stand-out abilities of the orphans--Violet invents, Klaus researches and Sunny bites--they manage to extricate themselves and finally convince others of Olaf's schemes, but never quite in time to prevent his escape. Repeat. Then, repeat again. Then again. <br /> <br />Given all of this, and the overly-simplistic narrative style (it explains words as it goes, etc.), it might be the natural conclusion to draw that the series is for very young children, and not very good even at that. It's certainly close to the conclusion I had drawn after finishing the The Bad Beginning, the first book of the series. But, at a friends request, I continued on... and... actually, it's kind of interesting. <br /> <br />A Series of Unfortunate Events is not as simple as it appears at first, and there is perhaps a kind of real design behind the repetitious elements. The dumbed-down narration is actually rather witty, it's running definitions allowing the author to comment on various topics with sarcasm and irony. The event cycle, recognizable by the third book, allows the reader to pick up on subtle variations, and make it all the more interesting when the series finally starts to deviate. Eventually, the narrator becomes a character in his own right (and thus of questionable reliability), and long-held assumptions are called into question, too. Even if it is mostly superficial, the characters do slightly change over the long-haul, and the social commentary infused in the various backdrops (The Austere Academy assaults schools, The Ersatz Elevator, the upper-class, and so on) provide enough to keep older readers interested and smiling. <br /> <br />Though I was highly hesitant to begin, and not excited at all about continuing after the first book, I must report that, over time, I adapted to the style and began to understand some of the humor that is not readily apparent at first glance. Both my appreciation, and the quality of the books themselves, have improved from volume to volume to the point where I am looking forward to the release of the thirteenth, and final, volume. <br /> <br />This is not the best series of all time, in any way, shape or fashion, but it actually is pretty good. Recommended.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I am one of the few who actually preferes Old Fashioned Christmas over Christmas Portrait.  Both are fine examples of masterful vocals and instumental arraingments (both sacred and secular) of holiday tunes; however, There is something about the opening set of Old Fashioned Christmas that strikes a chord. From Richard's a-ca-pella \\"It Came Upon A Midnight Clear\\" through the medly of instrumental tunes, of which, Richard's interpretation of \\"O Holy Night\\" is amazing, through the simple \\"An Old Fashioned Christmas\\" and into Karen's opening vocal on \\"Home for The Holidays\\" really plays well.  The anticipation that is created waiting for Karen's first note...\\"Oh there's no place like home for the holidays...\\" is far superior (which is saying A LOT) than on Christmas Portrait (which is also superbly done). <br /> <br />Karen was born to sing these songs.  It doesn't miss except for the short version of \\"Santa Clause is Coming to Town,\\" \\"Jingle Bells,\\" and \\"Silver Bells,\\" the only questionable tunes on either set.
B000024D4R|5.0|This was the album that blew away the Pink Floyd's 'spacy' image.    <br /> <br />There's no soft drumming to lull one into a daze on Animals.    There's no meditative organ, no warm saxophone, no atmospheric guitar chords, no dreamy voice scapes.   Instead, Animals is a rough, angry rant at the world, expressed in lyrics and music that are edgy, taut, and quite brilliant.  <br /> <br />Consider the time this album was made - the mid-1970s.   The world was sunken in a post-Vietnam heroin haze that obliterated the promise of the world-peace-dreaming late-1960s.  Watergate had just shocked America, the first oil shock had just hit the world, and Floyd themselves were coping with the fame, guilt and burden of superstardom.  <br /> <br />Little wonder then, that Roger Waters was taking a rather dim view of humanity.   <br /> <br />In Animals Waters sees all the people in the world as capable of being classified into three kinds of people and he uses the allegory of three kinds of animals to express this - Dogs, or those that rule through deceit and ambition, Pigs, or those that feed their greed off others, and Sheep, the rest of us who let the Dogs and Pigs have their way.   <br /> <br />Is this a backhanded call to revolution?  Maybe.  But mostly Animals is a wail of frustration, a cry from the innocent Waters growing up to fnd the world a far more bitter and dangerous place than he, or any of us, wants it to be.   <br /> <br />Dogs, cowritten by David Gilmour, is a searing guitar-led invocation of spite against the men Waters clearly sees as the arch-enemies of all mankind - our club-tie wearing leaders.  <br /> <br />The 20-minuite-long song, which sees Gilmour using his guitar to imitate dogs howling at each other in the night, took up nearly all of Side A when this album was released on vinyl in 1977.  I say nearly because despite Animals' harsh mood, it actually begins, and closes, with  twin songs of love and redemption, that are somewhat eccentrically called Pigs on the Wing I and II.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, Animals is one classic record where the CD format actually works even better than vinyl at showcasing the albums narrative theme because the songs on side B are meant to be seamless continuations of where side A ends.  <br /> <br />Pigs and Sheeps, which follow Dogs, are two of the Pink Floyd's most rocky and evocative numbers.  Both tracks open with eerie keyboard work from Richard Wright and both benefit from Nick Mason's behind-the-beat drumming.  But other than this, Wright and Mason contributed little to the album.  <br /> <br />Pigs is a snarling, jarring tune that you just want to turn on and turn up! Neighbors beware!  Gilmour's guitar sizzles, and  Waters sings this song with an energy and verve that were missing in many of his previous vocals.   From lamenting the falseness of the Dogs amongst us, in Pigs Waters laments the transparent greed of the merchant-class in our midst, and the hunger for wealth that all of us have, and which Waters sees as having come to define our lives.   <br /> <br />Waters despairs for the industrial wasteland capitalism and consumerism have created, and despairs even more that there is no escape from it for anyone. In his eyes, it is impossible to escape the banal, cruel, soggy world of the Pigs and the heavy sarcasm of the lyrics in the song, as well as the snarl with which they are delivered, bring all these passions to life vividly.  <br /> <br />The next track, Sheep, caused a mild sensation in some circles when Animals was released because of its rather irreverant take-off on the Lord's Prayer, which is mumbled over the song's jangly and slightly overwrought musical mid-section.   <br /> <br />Waters must have been glad for the controversy.   His intention with this song seems to have been to insult and mock all of us for allowing ourselves to be ruled by Dogs and Pigs as we are.  But its a \\"concerned mocking\\" if you will, an attempt at awakening listeners to what Waters sees as the impending plight of the world.   Sheep is a haunting song because it is the one most of us identify with, Waters once said.   But is that who were really are or what we like to believe of ourselves?  Listen closely and you might find your reality echoed  in Dogs or Pigs as well. <br /> <br />To close a album as gritty and daring as Animals with as sweet and moving a song as Pigs on the Wing must have seemed absurd to record executives.  But it works.   The song rescues Animals from what otherwise might have seemed like its unflagging stream of pessimism, its salty  undertaste of pathos, isolation and despair.   Pigs on the Wing redeems not only the album, it redeems us, for through it we can see that in the clarity of love all of us can be reborn and forgiven for the time we spent as Dogs, Pigs or Sheep.  <br /> <br />When Animals was first released, and through later years, it was not considered to be an album that was quite in the same grade as Dark Side of the Moon (1973) or Wish You Were Here (1975).   Perhaps people missed the Floyd's space sound and were a bit alienated by the album's sparse, tight sound, which makes many listeners a bit uneasy.   But the passage of time has only polished this rough diamond of a record, and perhaps in a few years it will be regarded as an even greater masterpiece than Wish You Were Here or The Wall (1979).
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Unfortunately, I was deployed while the series was televised.  But a friend told me about it, so I purchased the series.  It was all that he said.  So I went to the movie, and it was just as good.  The characters were true to the series, and I recommend that you buy the series on DVD, watch the episodes as they were meant to be shown, and then buy the movie when it comes out.
B000060MMI|5.0|Flogging Molly is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The Irish sound is great with the assortment of different instruments. You continue to get a very rhythmic beat and it becomes infectious. It doesn't really matter what mood you are in (sad, happy, angry, 'drunk'), this music fits all your moods. You can listen to the same song, no matter what mood you're in, and it will always comply as the sound you need to hear at the time. While I like the Swagger cd better, Drunken Lullabies is not far behind it. Another rousing collection that will make you want to move with it.
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|\\"The Wall\\" from Pink floyd had a fantastuc line up of songs.This movies carries over these songs and makes them higher quality.Though you can't just rate a movie on it's music,as thats only a part of what a movie has to offer.Well thats actually an essential chunk of this movie and without it this movie would fall into the depths of chud.(Some songs were removed and some were rerecorded)<br /><br />The movie has alittle to do with Rogger Waters,and Syd Barrett.(Both were members of Pink Floyd)With a dash of ficiton and drugs you get \\"The Wall\\".Overall i thought the first half of this movie was great,the second half seemed to drawn out and lost a movie touch.It's like a story with no point.It's fun to watch once, though by the ending it leaves you going \\"WHAT JUST HAPPNED?\\".The artistic element is genious.The sketches were fluent and really well done for the early 80's.<br /><br />The extra features are a nice addition,but haven't been touched from the original DVD version.Leaving you to wonder if this was a money scandal, whatever the case was it's cheaper and nicer packeged.I would say to rent this if you liek it buy it and appreciate the oddity.If you are a Pink Floyd fan you'll see those songs in a different light and would love this bizzar classic.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|Typical effort by someone who's obviously been influenced by the great ones (SRV, Hendrix...)and has alot of talent but has absolutely no soul. He can play some licks but is unable to put them together to provide the needed meaning and depth which this bluesy type of music demands. Spend your money on the lesser known greats such as Buddy Guy, Son Seals, or Magic Slim. This guy is overrated
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman Begins is the most unique, action-packed, and overall best Batman movie of all time.<br /><br />In this movie, instead of fights some of his famous enemies, such as the Joker and Poison Ivy, Bruce Wayne battles himself as he tries to find out who he really is.<br /><br />This is the one Batman flick where we get to see exactly how Batman came to be.  After witnessing the death of his parents when he was young, billionaire Bruce Wayne wanted to fight villainy in the world.  This drove him to become Batman; and, ironically, he chose to become 'Batman' because bats were what he was most afraid of.<br /><br />As Batman, Bruce Wayne uncovers a plot to damage Gotham City's water system, which would in turn destory the city itself.  With the help of Wayne Enterprises science wiz, Officer Gordon, and his friend Rachel, Batman must stop these criminals before Gotham City is wiped off the map.<br /><br />Overall, this Batman is great-filled with stunning action scenes and a good plot, this is a must-see movie for any and all Batman fans.  It is packed with intriguing information about how and why Bruce became Batman, and we get to see the beginnings of the Batcave, the Bat signal, and a sweet new Batmobile (though it can never replace the original one!).  I will admit, however, that the beginning is quite confusing the first time around; it starts with Bruce stuck in some prison in Asia, then he goes into the mountains to train with group that is a sort of 'secret police', the League of Shadows.  It all happens so fast that one can get lost and confused quite easily.  However, things pick up once Bruck gets back to Gotham City.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that this movie is perfect, but it has several aspects that make it nearly flawless.
038572179X|5.0|On the face of it, a very simple plotline, but there's a lot going on, and the lyrical and dense descriptive writing of things, places, emotions, feelings is a pleasure to read. One definitely needs to like this style of writing, and the 1st half of the book can occasionally drag somewhat with the richness of the text sometimes compelling me to speed-read through various descriptive passages, despite their being beautifully written. The 2nd half of the book reads much faster, and the twist at the end really gives the story beautiful closure.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|I keep hearing the words \\"emotion\\" and \\"passion\\" and \\"raw\\" and all manner of crap to describe this recording. Well i couldnt DISAGREE more ! I dont hear any of those things. I hear tired cliches of the blues, smeared with a heaping helping of john mayer's arrogance and a side of poor songwriting and singing. I'm getting sick to my stomach just thinking about it.
B00008RWRH|3.0|Poor Haydn, a genius whose symphonies rarely get the treatment that genius deserves. Here Eugen Jochum provides agreeable, thoroughly anodyne readings that wouldn't be acclaimed if the same casualness were applied to Mozart or Beethoven. I've owned this set of \\"London\\" Symphonies for twenty years and have yet to make it through without a disspiriting sense of boredom. The London Phil. plays agreeably enough -- I don't know the added performances from Berlin and Munich in this expanded box set -- and there's an overall air of pleasantness. DG's original analog recordings from the Sevneties are brighter and more natural in this reissue compared to the original CD transfer, it seems.<br /><br />However, if you want to come much closer to the fire, there's Bernstein on Sony, Beecham on EMI (both acknowledged as masters in this music), and for backward-glancing German traditionalists, Klemperer (also EMI, newly reissued at super bargain price), plus a few scattered recordings by Furtwangler.  In the opposite direction there are taut, streamlined Haydn recordings from Szell, Fricsay, and the originator himself, Toscanini. If you yearn for a controversial approach that adds more punch and sharper attacks than I for one feel comfortable with, there's Harnoncourt in semi-period style with the Royal concertgebouw. And for outright period style, there's a host of choices, of which Charles Mackerras's versions seem to have won considerable praise -- be prepared for jack-rabbit speed and a greatly pared-down orchestra.<br /><br />In short, as much as the Gramophone and various Amazon reviewers love these bland, plain-faced readings, I think any curious listener can do much, much better.
076790592X|5.0|Morrie Schwartz was a man of wisdom, kindness, and live even in his dying days. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom deserves a five star rating for the way it captures your heart and your  <br />attentions and teaches you many things about life and death. Tuesdays with Morrie is a wonderful story about a man who goes back to see his old professor who is dying from a disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mitch goes to visit his professor every Tuesday and they bond as if they had been life long friends. Morrie teaches Mitch things from every aspect of life such as: life, marriage, family, love, death, and friends. Morrie's view on life is inspiring and changing for everyone. Mitch writes with an awesome talent and while reading you really view Morrie as the person he was and can view their relationship for what it was. Mitch makes a  <br />noble, but selfish attempt to hold onto a piece of Morrie by recording their sessions together. The idea of recording a dying mans last words seams disrespectful in way kind of making Morrie's death not seem to be taken seriously enough. Tuesdays with Morrie is an amazing book that captures the rider's attention and fills the reader with live and encourages the reader to be better person. <br /> <br />      Morrie is the kind of person everyone wants to know. He is kind, loving, intelligent and optimistic. Morrie's view on life is wonderful and full of joy even as he is slowly dying. He makes the simplest day seem like the best thing in the world. Morrie teaches you to embrace and love the simple things in life. Morrie doesn't care about money, car, and the house. He cares about the love, friendship and giving to others. Morrie makes a wonderful point in saying, \\"When you're in bed you're dead\\". Morrie took each day as a new day and gave what he could to all the people that came to visit him. <br /> <br />      Mitch records his sessions with Morrie every Tuesday. It seams like a disrespectful thing to do. Morrie is slowly dying and Mitch is selfish in trying to hold onto Morrie's voice. Mitch also makes himself out to be a stubborn student who is at first so caught up in his own life even the things Morrie says to Mitch don't seams like they can be taken fully to heart because of the life Mitch led prior to reuniting with Morrie. <br /> <br />      The book can be easily related to by anyone who reads it because of the many topics discussed. Morrie Schwartz truly understood the meaning of life and everything in life that came  <br />his way. Tuesdays with Morrie teaches its readers the true values in life and how to deal the bad and good. Morrie's optimism and comical outlook on life and disease in an inspiration to everyone. <br /> <br />      Tuesdays with Morrie is an inspirational book that captures the heart of its readers. Morrie Schwartz was a wonderful human being and his outlook on life will help many to cope with the things that make life tough. Morrie inspired a busy man to slow down and look at the more important  things in life after 16 years and Mitch Albom's book about his old professor can do the same for it's readers. Tuesday with Morrie is a true phenomena!
B000002L61|4.0|The Last In Line featured the same great line-up that produced the classic Holy Diver. This album charted much higher than the debut due to the fact that Dio had already created a buzz and MTV was playing the video for The Last In Line every day. I don't think this album is as good as Holy Diver but it comes close. There is still plenty of great guitar from Vivian, and Dio delivers his usual great performance. Vinnie Appice (Mob Rules!) and Jimmy Bain (ex-Rainbow) are as solid as they were on the debut. The album opens with the classic up-tempo We Rock featuring superb drumming from Vinnie. Next is the title track with great vocals/lyrics from Dio and an excellent solo from Vivian. After that comes Breathless which has a decent riff and a cool chorus. I Speed At Night is the fastest song on the album, kind of the evil twin of the debut's Stand Up And Shout. Next is the slow paced One Night In The City which has a good chorus and another great guitar solo. Evil Eyes took me a while to get into but now it is one of my favorite tracks. The lyrics and vocals are classic Dio. Mystery is the poppiest song on the album but it is quite catchy and Vivian gets the chance to wail come solo time. I never really cared for Eat Your Heart Out, it's just not very interesting. The last track, Egypt (covered by Doro), is ok even though it drags on a bit. All in all The Last In Line is one of Dio's best albums throughout his career.
B000BVD460|3.0|Where's Haille's song? Where's 8 Mile road? What is 'Fack' and 'Shake it' doing on the CD? Why is it only 17 tracks long? Eminem is undoubtedly one of the most successful and greatest emcees, but this is no great 'greatest hits' CD. <br />So if I were you, i'll download all my favorite eminem tracks and put them onto a CD of my own. No point wasting your money on this incomplete greatest hits CD.   <br /> <br />cheers
B000002J09|5.0|Wow. Almost 35 years have passed. It's hard to believe that we are (anyone over 40 :\) talking about a Led Zeppelin album on this thing called the Internet. I must admit that I still own the original vinyl (is that an oxymoron?) and have recently 'digitized' it; I love the analog bass sound of LPs.    Anyway. Great album/LP/CD. There's not much to say that hasn't already been said in 800+ reviews. But I do have a few comments for the kids that write about something they couldn't possibly understand.    For one, you were not alive when this album was made.     Second. We'll see in 40 yrs if the latest Slip Knot or Korn is as revered as a Led Zeppelin CD/DVD (or whatever). Chances are slim to none.    Third. Regarding these so called better bands. Where do think they learned to play? I hear Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix all over that stuff. I should know. I've been teaching guitar for 30+ years.     Fourth. Did you know that most recording acts of today are told what to play? In the time of Led Zeppelin, there was much more room for creativity by the artist, not a bunch of lawyers.    I don't have anything against younger bands, they are very talented as well. But today's generation mocks the very reason for it's culture. Loud guitars, bass and drums with screaming vocals are nothing new. So get in touch with your past and give this CD a serious listen or wait 20 yrs or so to grow up.
0385334206|5.0|I had to read this book for a college English course, and I finished it within days of the initial assignment. It's a really fabulous novel.<br /><br />It's clear that some reviewers missed the point of this novel. Yes, most definitely an easy and entertaining read, there are many, many layers. It also has a great meta-narrative. What some consider \\"condescending\\" is really a play on the plot itself. It's written in the guise of a sci-fi novel Kilgore might write. Basically, it's written so that someone (either a child or someone not from Earth) can understand the things that we seemingly take for granted.<br /><br />Vonnegut also alludes to the idea that we've lost touch with our past and what was once important to us through different annecdotes and stories. He has a really great argument about naming and how the importance of such names are either lost or ignored. It's a great commentary on our lives as Americans especially.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book. It's a great, fast read.
B000BB14YY|5.0|It really is about time this masterpiece got the treatment it deserved.  I have long held off purchasing this movie in its previous DVD incarnations because of the notoriously bad transfers.  At long last, justice has been served.  I couldn't ask for much more than this, short of getting to see it one more time on the big screen.<br /><br />All the extras are great, and to me, more than justify the price.  The commentaries are very much worth checking out, and the documentary on the second disc is quite fascinating just on its own.<br /><br />As to the movie itself, there isn't really anything to be said about this stupendous achievement that hasn't been said already.  Kurosawa very nearly bankrupted his studio making \\"Ran,\\" and it really is a miracle that the movie ever found its way to the big screen in the first place.  Simply to refer to it as an adaptation of \\"King Lear\\" is to do injustice to Kurosawa; he pillaged more Shakespeare than simply \\"Lear\\" (Lady Kaede owes more to MacBeth than to Lear, definitely), but he drew from multiple sources, and ultimately, from his own story-telling ability.  Ultimately one is left with a devastating portrayal of treachery, vengeance, the disintegration of well-laid plans, and the fragility of the human condition.  If that isn't enough, the battle scenes kick ass.<br /><br />If you love the art of movie-making, this is a movie that has to be part of your collection.  Just make sure to get the right version!
4789009637|5.0|I had been self-studying Japanese over numerous websites for 'bout 7 months when I decided to actually get a textbook. After searching around, reading reviews, asking people what they think I decided on Genki I. What a fantastic choice!! I learned more in 2 weeks in this book than I learned 7 months on a computer. Here I go, in depth (summary at end ^_~): <br /> <br />A) It starts out with an overview of the book, explanation of alphabets, so-on-and-so-forth, ect. Not much here but an introduction, soooo.... <br /> <br />B) Dialogue - The beginning of the lesson has a dialogue that goes with a certain lesson theme (e.g. New Friends covers greetings, simple questions, numerous phrases and vocab, ect.). This is written in kana (after lesson 3, kanji w/ furigana), romanji, (if any) katakana w/ furigana, and an English translation. You won't understand what's being said 'till the next few pages, so now onto that. <br /> <br />C) Vocabulary - A loooong list of vocab resides here. Although it may be sorta \\"random\\", it is useful and good stuff to know. Words and terms used in the dialogue are marked with an asterisk \\"*\\". This page is written in kana, kanji w/ furigana, (if any) katakana w/ furigana, romanji, and English. Ok! Here we go: <br /> <br />D) Grammar - easy-to-understand grammar explanations rest here, after vocab. This provides the info needed to actually USE the vocab. After reading this, you should probably get a lot more of the dialogue. But not quite.... <br /> <br />E) Um, Other? - These pages contain numerous class activities (not very useful to self-studiers, but can have some good practice exercises if you play both parts XD), other grammar/useful notes explanations, some more vocab perhaps, more dialogues, ect. In later lessons, this contains the kanji explanations as well. Basically, it's a planned lesson part that puts all you have learned in the previous pages to the test. It really builds on what you need to know, and forces you to read back, building stronger understanding and memorization ^^  <br /> <br />Summary: Clear, neat, and fun planned lessons, put together in a learning-effective format. Great for all ages (it IS intended for college classroom use, but I am a 13 self-studier, and I find it great!!) as well! You will learn so much, and be reading, speaking, writing, and UNDERSTANDING real Japanese by the end of the book! <br /> <br />Other notes: Be sure to get the CDs (especially if you're learning on your own) and the workbook. The workbook reinforces grammar and such, and the CD helps you listen, speak, and understand spoken Japanese better (REALLY helpful! It's extremely helpful at learning and understanding the accent!!!!). <br /> <br />Thanks for listening to my rambling! Hope it has given enough detail and everything you want to know before you decide on a good book!! (ALSO: do NOT get the Japanese For Busy People series; no matter how popular, it is terrible!!!!! Genki is a waaaay better investment!) <br /> <br />-Sachi
B000006TSC|3.0|That's right  -  essential.  Look, I own virtually ALL of the recorded Camel material, and if I had to compile a Top Five Songs list of the group, two of those five songs would come from THIS album alone:  \\"Echoes\\" (my favorite Camel song of all time!) and \\"The Sleeper\\".<br /><br />We diehard Camel fans will usually admit that it's the instrumentals that we love most about the band, with vocals only a peripheral element to the music.  (Why else do you think we all feel that \\"The Snow Goose\\" is their best album?)  Both \\"Echoes\\" and \\"The Sleeper\\" are heavy on the instrumental gymnastics.  The few vocals that do appear in \\"Echoes\\" are really well-done, and flow perfectly with the rest of the song.  The two-part \\"The Sleeper\\" is a classic Camel instrumental with odd time signatures and jazz-rock soloing.  Clever drums, dancing bass lines, cool synthesizer sounds, and great guitar/sax/keyboard soloing in both songs make them essential songs for the serious Camel collector.<br /><br />Hey, I'm compulsive enough to have plopped down good money just to own ONE song from an otherwise unnecessary album.  But with this album, you get some decent secondary songs to make the whole purchase worth your while, as well as a heavy dose of great sax, courtesy of guest Mel Collins.  Some of the \\"decent\\" music includes the title track that begins the album, and the three-minute Santana-like guitar outro to \\"Summer Lightning\\", which is simply STUNNING (despite the disco drumming).  After those, you have some \\"nice\\" songs (\\"Wing and a Prayer\\" and \\"Rainbow's End\\") and the admittedly disappointing, blah, unremarkable ones (\\"Starlight Ride\\", \\"You Make Me Smile\\", and the Canterbury-ishly tongue-in-cheek \\"Down on the Farm\\").  Curses!<br /><br />This was my very first Camel album purchase back in the mid-70's, so I've always tried to defend my little discovery against the critics.  But there's no sense in denying that some commercialism crept into this album on a few tracks, and the album would have to stand behind at least 5 or 6 other Camel albums in terms of overall quality.<br /><br />Unfortunately for your wallet, you NEED \\"Echoes\\" and \\"The Sleeper\\".....so buy the album if you can't find them on any other compilations.<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 7.9/10;  Performance = 9/10;  Production = 8/10;  CD length = 7/10.<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 8.1  (\\"3-1/2 stars\\")least 5 or 6 other Camel albums in terms of overall quality.

B000BKDOCA|4.0|I'm a Britney Spears fan.  I think she has great songs and she's pretty easy on the eyes, to say the least.  But this remix album didn't appeal to me as much as previous compilation discs such as her Greatest Hits mainly because they were all songs I'd heard before and they were remade (I already had the Greatest Hits CD so I didn't need another compilation album of some of her biggest singles).  Boy, was I suprised when I happened to hear the record, yo!!  \\"Everytime\\" is played around with and it sounds great, especially the bridge when the \\"And this song is my sorry\\" is played on an off beat.  Freakin' sweet!  Great album, definitely a surprise.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Finally, Korn has returned after a temultuous 2 year break!! I get really sick of people automatically selling them short because their copy-cats have overtaken them in the \\"pop\\" arena. SYOTOS..does what \\"Untouchables\\" attempted to do...shed the skin of \\"nu-metal\\" and blend new elements of industrial and classic rock. I believe on this record, Korn did a bang up job. People need to get over the first 3 records (As do metallica fans) they will NEVER recreate them...music is an evolutionary game...(even AC/DC changes it up from time to time!). There are alot of great songs on this cd. \\"Tearjerker\\" made my jaw hit the floor...it shows that JD can actually sing his ass off. Bottom Line...this record will most likely return Korn to the level they were at in 1999...and I can't wait!!!!
B000002J27|5.0|This 1976 classic is after the \\" Gabriel era\\", and the start of the \\"Collins takeover\\" as I like to call it. On this album the tracks \\"Entangled\\", \\"Ripples\\", and \\"Los Endos\\" really surprised me. On the front cover, back cover, and the insides of the album, the pictures really reflect the main story of the songs they correspond to, such as the picture old lady looking in the mirror, which corresponds to \\"Ripples\\", and the picture of the faun corresponds to \\"A Trick of the Tail\\". With Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett creating beautiful melodys on guitar, adding another dimension to Genesis's music, Tony Banks putting in the effects on the keyboard, and Phil Collins adding a rhythm, I would rate this album one of the best of several masterpieces that Genesis has made. <br />
B000059MEK|1.0|This music is HORRIBLE.  Okay, so 'Homework' had some quirky, fun tracks, (some cheesey tracks too), and some surprisingly hard tracks.  The French aren't known for their music, but I was very impressed.   <br /> <br />When this came out I hoped it would offer more of the same:  A few cheese tracks, but a few great ones thrown in.  Apparently not.  These guys must have had a change of taste in music.  This album is one of the worst things I've ever heard. <br />The first time I heard 'one more time' I thought it must not be the same band.  Once I realized it was the 'Daftlies' I was still hoping that track was just the bad song off the record and the rest were better.  No.....  they are all as bad.  I mean, this album is BAD.
0553801503|3.0|All of the criticisms written previously are in my opinion accurate but I wanted to add another worry...I think that fond readers of this series my be in for another Wheel of Time fiasco, and God I hope that I am wrong.  As most fantasy readers know, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time \\"Trilogy\\" (laugh) has gone well beyond the point of being remotely interesting and into the boringly laughable.  I can only hope that Martin learns a lesson from that now-weak series and starts to throw a bit more action into the mix.  Please do not get me wrong, I absolutely love this series and can't wait for the next half of this book (which I assume will actually be available in the next decade some time)...but I said that about the Wheel of Time around book 4 as well.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Do not waste your $$ on this album.  All the songs sound the same! Madonna has taken dance beats from the past and just added a few elementary rhymes (i.e., New York, dork)! I expect something a little deeper from a 46 year old established singer and former superb songwriter. But like sheep to the slaughter, a lot of people are buying this cd just because it's Madonna. Oh well.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This is even worse than take a look in the mirror <br />Only a brain washed Korn fan from the fourms could like this <br />buy the first 5 Korn albums <br />Burn this one <br /> <br />Only Korn FanBoys will like it
B000BVEKO0|5.0|u figure with the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch that the band wouldnt be the same as before. well u're right.. they r not the same... in fact, they r different and more intense then ever. Their first album with EMI/Virgin is looking like the rebirth of Korn's excellence. they have been around n kickin ass... its just this time... they r on the other side... and harder than ever!
B000000W6X|2.0|Overall, I found this record too boring to even bother using as background music. Background music doesn't have to be so bland. But there are a few standouts. <br /> <br />\\"Protection\\" - Gorgeous song. Not the best opener, but it's great. <br />\\"Karmacoma\\" - Great track with not-so-great lyrics. <br />\\"Three\\", \\"Weather Storm\\" - Okay, but kindda average and cheesy. <br />\\"Spying Glass\\" - Same as the last 2 but also annoying. <br />\\"Better Things\\" - Starts off incredibly dull but gets a little better, mostly due to Tracy Thorn. Lyrics could be less..dull. <br />\\"Eurochild\\" - Pretty good! Actually \\"chill\\". <br />\\"Sly\\" - Boring & pretentious. <br />\\"Heat Miser\\" - Boring. <br />\\"Light My Fire\\" - Really horrible cover.
B0000025RI|4.0|The greatest pop record if not the greatest record of all time. Not that it was possible seing as Paul McCartney's Pipes of Peace came out in '83 and Thriller in '82, but if \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" was replaced with \\"Say, Say, Say\\" this album would be even better.
B000BVD460|4.0|First off this album iz a hits album not an official album it gives u 14 of his radio hits (not his personall favs) , and for yall out there sayin ems garbade and this and that SHUT IT ! , any true hip hop fan whoo saw a lil white boy come out of nowhere woulda never thought em would of made it like he did so sit on that. this guys done so much for the hip-hop world and took everyone bye storm so please dont disrespect. and for all yall ghetto hip hop posers whoo dont wanna look fake so u only listen too underground rap just too look real , yall pathethic ems done what he had 2 for rap and will go down as one of the top rappers too ever grace da mic. - keep it real - And as for the album its the hits all the songs that made him big not his personall favs so remember that. - keep it real - (4 stars too too the fact there just the radio hits but still strong)
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I love Heavy, aggressive music, though as i am getting older (26) i find that i also enjoy music, not pop, just good dark music with creativity and great hooks and vocals. I have grown with Korn and have loved everything they have done. Old fans will whinge, but what's new, i have heard it since Issues (probably the best Korn album ever), but those poeple have a choice yet they don't seem to make a choice, they would prefer to listen and whinge rather that just stop listening anymore.  <br /> <br />Apparently for alot of old Korn fans all they need is an album full of screaming, that just doesn't do it for me anymore. I LOVE Jonathan's voice, it is fantastic, Korn would not be anywhere near as good without his voice.  <br /> <br />This album they experimented and have come up with a heavy/dark album. It isn't as fast (even though i never thought they were fast, but they were compared to this album) but the melodies are very catchy and the lyrics are awesome, it was such a great idea for Jonathan to step away from what he has known for so long and the result was fantastic. <br /> <br />All in all if i could give this album 10/5 i would, it has been great moving on with Korn and i hope to do it for many, many years to come.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I have to say, I looked forward to this album, and it is one of the worst of Madonna's long career.  I grew up listening to her music, and must admit that the lyrics and musical scores are very immature for someone who has been around as long as she has.  I would expect this from a novice singer, but never from an artist in the leagues of Madonna.    Her best album to date has been \\"Ray Of Light\\".  She's had two very mediocre albums in between, but to have an album holding a magnitude of higher expectations fall as flat as this one is extremely disappointing.      Save your money and spend it elswhere on music that really is chart worthy.
B000002542|4.0|This is Journey's first album.  It was released in 1975.  The sound quality is good.  It is a \\"full lenth\\" album and not an \\"EP\\", as listed by Amazon.  But, it is only 37 minutes long, which is the range of a standard LP back in the day (LP's were typically 35 to 45 minutes long). <br /> <br />As the album was being recorded, Journey was just becoming a band.  The band consisted of Greg Rolle and Neal Schon from Santana, Aynsley Dunbar (a British drummer who played in blues and progressive bands and was in Frank Zappa's band), Ross Valory and George Tickner (who would only be on this album). <br /> <br />The band and the album get off to a great and promising start with the song \\"Of A Lifetime\\".  It might be the second best thing Journey has ever done (I think \\"Look Into the Future\\" is the best).  It has a number of other great songs like, In My Lonely Feeling and Mystery Mountain. <br /> <br />The CD isn't quite as succesful with the 2 instrumentals, Kouhetek and Topaz (and I am a huge instrumental fan).  Kouhetek is especially pointless.  It isn't horrible, it just doesn't match the quality of Of A Lifetime or In My Lonely Feeling. <br /> <br />If you like the Journey hits, with Steve Perry singing, there is a good chance that you will not like this album.  The music is completely different than when Perry joined the group, and it changed to corporate rock. <br /> <br />The music on the first 3 albums, before Perry joined, is much richer, but also much harder.  In some ways it sounds like a rock version of Santana, with the rich textures of music.  There is a combination of many music styles, including jazz and blues. <br /> <br />But, mainly, the early Journey was a hard rock band...but a hard rock band with some depth.  In concert they played very hard and very heavy.
0689853637|5.0|As a librarian at an elementary school, I wanted something wonderful as part of the holiday collection to read to my students and, since I own all of the other Sabuda books, I bought this sight unseen, knowing I'd love it.  I was totally unprepared for the AMAZING reception this book would get from my students, K through 6th grade--it's been like listening to a crowd at a fireworks display!  They have loved it and many of them are asking their parents to buy it for them as a Christmas gift--every librarian's dream!  You can't go wrong! (It is not, of course, suitable for check-out, but IS a perfect read aloud.)
0142004235|5.0|My book club recently picked this as a selection (for a two-month gap!) and I was delighted.  I don't remember the last time I read a book that had such great character development and a lovely story to follow.  It hasn't been predictable.  I think it'll lead to great discussion.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is a fantastic Aerosmith album wherein all their skills are brought together into one masterpiece of seventies hard rock. Encompassing the funky grooves that Perry and Kramer bring with them, Walk This Way and Adam's Apple make the record roll while No More, No More, Round and Round, Sweet Emotion, the title track, and Uncle Salty make it rock.<br /><br />I've never been too fond of their cover of Big Ten Inch Record, but it's a fan favorite and was pretty tongue in cheek. The ballad at the end is the best Tyler's ever done - even up to today's poppy rubbish. It's plaintive without being maudlin, the strings are perfectly utilized, and the coda is well done.<br /><br />No More No More and Sweet Emotion are two of the best songs in their extensive catalog, and the FM staple Walk This Way has shown how durable it is over the years. Tyler wrote some of his best lyrics, Perry, Hamilton, and Whitford put music to his prose, and you have Aerosmith at their best. A top 100 of all time in rock history.
0307276902|5.0|Loved the book.  I am a former addict/alcoholic.  I was in and out of AA for years.  It was only when I completely left AA did I quit using and drinking completely.  Like James, I was told repeatedly that AA was the only way- that the vast, vast majority of people will fail if not involved in a 12 step program.  When being told this while in the program it felt like my death warrent-- because I knew that no matter how hard I worked the 'simple' program it was not what I needed.  What I need turned out to be self reliance and self-empowerment.  I have been clean/sober for over five years.  The truth is, as many respected studies have shown, that the MAJORITY of people quit on their own.  While I am sure the people who told James Frey and myself that AA was the only way to stop using are well meaning, they are doing a huge disservice and/or ignoring the facts.  I am heartend this excellent book is getting so much attention.  Perhaps it will lessen the strangle hold that that AA holds on the recovery industry.
B00092ZL80|5.0|By now, fans of each band know how successful their two-season tour has been.  Since it's unlikely that CHI and EW&F will hit the road together in 2006, this DVD is a great item to own. <br /> <br />The performance captured here is terrific.  Both bands perform with energy and style (unlike some of the subsequent 2005 shows, where lighting, sound, and a shortened set list plagued Chicago).  As others have noted, the highlights happen when the bands perform together; particularly great is the brass performance on Chicago's \\"Free\\"--a tour deforce for EW&F saxman Gary Bias and the rest of the horns.  Also really cool are Phillip Bailey's soaring high notes, Bill Champlin's rendition of \\"After the Love Is Gone,\\" Russian guitarist Vadim Zibershtein's solo on \\"25 or 6 to 4,\\" and the combined joy evident in this rendition of \\"September Song.\\" <br /> <br />Individual sets rock, too.  EW&F simple defy age and gravity, and the relatively new horn section (Reggie Young, Bias, and Bob Burns) rips.  The Chicago set captured here is almost as high-energy, and the famous Chicago horns (Jimmy Pankow, Lee Loughnane, Walt Parazaider) play tweaked arrangements perfectly and with style.  My only compaint is that I feel Chicago does too many of their ballad hits to 'compete' with EW&F, but I'm sure I'm in the minority; most fans would probably select exactly the same songs the band performs here. <br /> <br />In short, it's great to see those two powerhouse bands at the top of their game, pushing each other and obviously enjoying it.  As Robert Lamm says, \\"Music is unity.\\"  This is a DVD well worth owning.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|basically... john mayer is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! i've heard him compared to the likes of SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I am not a huge Shakespeare fan, but I love this movie.  Gorgeous costumes, and great music.  I think this is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen.  The ending leaves me in tears every time, yet still wishing to find my Shakespeare who lives and loves and speaks and writes with such passion, poetry, and ardor.  I think it is a must own for those who are fans of Shakespeare, yet able to approach the subject in a light-hearted manner.  It's also perfect for those who love historical fiction, especially romance.  Passion, comedy, love...  who needs more?
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Admittedly, this was my favorite film of the year in its original form.    The Special Edition was worth the wait, and in my opinion, is worth buying even if you purchased the original.    The second disc includes the film in a new version -- as three separate graphic novels (and one graphic short story) --fully capturing Frank Miller's incredible vision in glorious black and white (and red and yellow).  In a word, amazing.  I almost always find director's cuts to be a tiresome affair -- simply re-inserting scenes that were correctly cut the first time.  Not so.  Not one frame feels like filler.  Everything serves to deepen and enrich the amazing world of Basin City.    I haven't made it through all of the new extras yet (on the second disc), but two are definitely worth noting.  The 15 minute Flic School (a staple of Rodriguez's special editions) is great and focuses on the process of shooting in the digital domain -- one surprise was learning that many of the actors who work together seamlessly in the film never actually met in person.  Ahh the magic of digital editing.    The companion piece to the flic school is an all greenscreen version of the theatrical release.  That is -- Rodriguez takes only the raw footage of the film, without any special effects, de-colorization and in many cases, sets -- and speeds the whole thing up so you get to race through the film and see how they did it -- which sets were real, which ones weren't, etc.    Truly incredible.    This one gets my vote for DVD release of the year.
B000B8QF14|4.0|I'll keep this review short.  This album doesn't compare to the fantastic AMERICAN IDIOT album, but it is a very good live set.  The packaging is cool with a DVD of the live performance which makes it worth the price (which is a bit expensive, especially for a live disc).  Key performances include \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" and \\"Longview\\".  If you love Green Day's most notable hits, the live performances prove to be a treat.  Not their best, but a good effort.  A very good effort for a live performance.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Alright, here's the deal: I adore this movie. I've watched it an embarrassing number of times. However, I don't think its a particularly good movie.  <br /> <br />Essentially, the story is great, the acting is mediocre, and the look is fabulous. The atmosphere is amazing, and I think the special effects suit the story perfectly. I love the concepts introduced through the story, but I've always favored the exploration of religious mythology.  <br /> <br />As for the acting, I was actually impressed with Keanu Reeves--this is the sort of role that suits him, because he can be deadpan, and it will actually look good. Rachel Wiesz I was less impressed with, although there were a couple of moments where she was quite good. Overall, the performances are just unremarkable.  <br /> <br />There are many small problems with the film, that I can't even name but simply know are there. Overall, I think it's just general cheesiness. It's a B-movie. The characters around Constantine are one-dimensional and mostly silly. There are a couple of moments that are just ridiculous posing. But as fluffy B action movies go, I think this one's definitely a keeper.
B000BVD460|4.0|While CURTAIN CALL isn't the perfect hits collection, it is a very, VERY good one.  It includes the biggest hits of Eminem's career while omitting only a few singles.  The collection contains \\"My Name Is\\", \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", and \\"Lose Yourself\\", the singer's most notable and most critically acclaimed tracks.  Also, the other songs on this compilation for the most part are also hits, if not to the same caliber as the above mentioned including three from Em's last album: \\"Just Lose It\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Toy Soldiers\\" (ENCORE), \\"Way I Am\\", \\"Stan\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\" and \\"Guilty Conscience\\".  Unfortunately, Em's hot streak is detracted by tracks such as the new \\"Shake That\\" (which does to its credit feature a nice performance by Nate Dogg) and \\"When I'm Gone\\".  Also, the live version of \\"Stan\\" isn't bad, but Elton John's guest vocals on the hook aren't at the level that Elton usually sings, which detracts from this unlikely collaboration.<br /><br />Production is strong throughout this set showcasing Eminem at his most creative and best.  Only a few flaws keep this from being the perfect compilation. This album makes up for the mediocrity that some of Eminem's last studio album, ENCORE, had. Great compilation.
0345440900|1.0|BEWARE if you use the methods of the \\"baby whisperer\\".  Her approaches are not grounded in any infant research and in my opinion, are harmful to infant attachment.  Infant attachment is important as it sets the stage for trusting adult relationships.  Her methods are not very different than the numerous cry-it-out approaches out there.  <br /> <br />I can say these things with confidence as we were committed to using the baby whisperer for the first 5 mos of my dtr's life.  She NEVER was able to fall asleep on her own using the baby whisperer methods even though we stuck with them over and over again.   <br /> <br />What was most upsetting though, was that she became clingy, fearful, and had poor eye contact after these 5 mos. My husband and I both noticed it. We switched to attachment parenting and used the approaches from Kate Allison Granju's book \\"Attachment Parenting\\" and \\"Good Nights\\" by Jay Gordon.  What a difference after a month!!  She was a happy, social baby!!  We are convinced it is because we were losing her trust, night after night putting her to bed using these methods. <br /> <br />Attachment parenting is the best choice and developmentally the best option. Don't take shortcuts like the baby recommends, this is only a short period of your lives but is so crucial!   My daughter is 8 months now and is very happy and not at all clingy and fearful. The family bed has been a really excellent choice even though I was the most reluctant family-bedder you'll meet.  Give it a try........... <br /> <br />
B000002KJQ|3.0|This album has its ups and downs, with some of the greatest rock of the 70's to some of the worst songs I've ever heard ZZ Top perform. Here's what I think:    Waitin' For The Bus--Probably the second-to-best song on the album, with its nice guitar rythem and a good tune. It also features an amazing guitar solo by Billy Gibbons. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill.    Jesus Just Left Chicago--One of the worst songs on the album. I've never heard worse singing from Billy Gibbons, and the country music is just too much for me to stand. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Beer Drinkers And Hell Raisers--Positively the best song on the entire album. This is one of the greatest rock songs that was ever played in the 70's, and one of the first to display ZZ Top's full potential. It is also an obvious influence for ZZ Top's 1996 song \\"She's Just Killing Me,\\" which is one of my favorite songs of all time. Featuring vocals by Dusty Hill and Billy Gibbons.    Master Of Sparks--In this song, Billy resumes his singing voice that he used in \\"Jesus Just Left Chicage,\\" but this time it uses a good tune and is put to a good song. This song is actually some pretty good rock. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Hot, Blue, And Righteous--I know, I know. It's a ballad, not a rock song. But that doesn't mean it can't be a bad song! This song is three minutes of ZZ Top being quieter than I've ever heard them before. The singing isn't anything better than the song. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard.    Move Me On Down The Line--This song is a lot more lively than the song before it, which makes it pretty appreciative. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard.    Precious And Grace--This song is an obvious influence for the 1994 ZZ Top song \\"Pincushion,\\" though not quite as good. The singing isn't as quite as good as that in \\"Pincushion,\\" and the tune isn't quite as good either (Though the tune is pretty good, just becausethis song doesn't match the quality of \\"Pincushion,\\" it still is pretty good.) Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    La Grange--This song appears to be very popular for movies; it was featured in SHANGHAI NOON, ARMAGEDDON, and LORDS OF DOGTOWN. It gives a very different experience than the rest of the album, because we hear Frank Beard's voice for the first time not as backup, instead as lead singing. And we also see why he sings fewer songs than Billy and Dusty. Okay, the singing is pretty bad, but the rock music is great. And anyway, who never got a kick out of the \\"Ah haw haw haws?\\" This song may have been an influence for the 80's ZZ Top song \\"My Head's In Mississippi,\\" as the tune is fairly similar to the tune of that. Featuring vocals by Frank Beard.    Shiek--This song doesn't appeal to me much. It is too long and just doesn't do anything that makes me find it very interesting. Not to mention the 30 seconds of bass combined with bell ringing at the end. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Have You Heard?--Another bad country song. This time, the singing isn't THAT bad, but the song just is too light and slow to appeal to rock fans like me. Plus there's Billy Gibbons's scream-singing at the end. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|So, we all know that Take a Look in the Mirror blows a little. I really don't want to get into that too much. On their seventh album, KoRn decides to try something different with all these industrial influences and new producers and I think it really works. Though some complain that this album is not heavy enough, I think it is plenty heavy. Songs like Politics, Hypocrites, Getting Off and Liar are examples. I'm not going to lie. I am a diehard KoRn fan. I stood out in the cold today for 4 hours to get a poster signed by KoRn tonight. I didn't think I would be disappointed by this CD and I wasn't. Here'es a track by track review since I know you kids love those: <br /> <br />1. Twisted Transistor (8/10) - There were a couple of things tweaked in the CD version like the extended intro and extended bridge that were not expected and made the song a little fresher than it really was. The riff (though repeated again sometime on SYOTOS) is a very catchy one that I find myself humming and random points through the day. <br /> <br />2. Politics (8/10) - I don't know. I really like David's drumming but the only thing that really does it for me in this song is the bridge. Jonathan's growl is very nice and the message makes me happy. \\"Don't give a s*** about politics!\\" That's really how more people should feel.  <br /> <br />3. Hypocrites (8/10) - Yeah. The riff really is repeated quite a lot in this song but I don't mind because I like the riff. I prefer the live version of this song because it is a bit faster than the studio version. Overall good song. The pre-chorus and the chorus do it for this song. Jon's vocals are on point. <br /> <br />4. Souvenir (10/10) - At first, my favorite song on the CD. It's so melodic that it scares me. It's no wonder the first rumored title for SYOTOS was Souvenir of Sadness. This is a shining point on the album and Jonathan's vocals are really great. <br /> <br />5. 10 Or a 2-Way (7/10) - This is Fieldy's song. He is the main guy on this song and it is obvious. The problem I have with this song is that it seems to lack coherence. I can't quite follow what the hell is going on. But, the pre-chorus from Last Legal Drug is used as a bridge in this song and every time that bridge comes on, I get happy.  <br /> <br />6. Throw Me Away (9/10) - I'm quite familiar with this song because I bought The Other Side, Part 2 - EP from iTunes. I liked it instantly. It has a different vibe to it that is dark and sinister. The sound effects in the background and David's hard drumming make this song what it is and is another one of those melodic song. I like melodic. <br /> <br />7. Love Song (9/10) - Great song. At times feels like a heavy metal church song. It reminds me of the pipe organ and the... nevermind. I really like the lyrics in this song and the chorus is the high point in the song <br /> <br />8. Open Up (10/10) - Not only is Open Up a really good slow song, at the end, there is an abrupt halt to the song and then there is an interlude with some awesome scatwork from Jonathan. Of course the scatwork is electronically helped but it sounds really good, I think. At first, I didn't know what to make of it but I like it. <br /> <br />9. Coming Undone (9/10) - This song was played live at their show at Hammerstein last week and I think it is definitely single material. The chorus is catchy and Jonathan's vocals are, again, really awesome. After the concert I had the chorus in my head all night and the same is true now that I have the studio verison. <br /> <br />10. Getting Off (8/10) - This is one of those heavy songs I alluded to earlier. The stop-and-go guitars in the verses really work well with Jonathan's growling. Jonathan really shines in this song as does Munky. <br /> <br />11. Liar (10/10) - More single material. This song was also on The Other Side, Part 2 - EP so I've been familiar with it. From first listen I thought that it should be a single. It's heavy and has great melodies in it that get me singing along every time I hear it. Though the scat seems a bit out of place and the bagpipe outro is sort of weird, the overall song is amazing. <br /> <br />12. For No One (10/10) - My current favorite on the CD. Though the lyrics are kind of cheesy at points, the song is so melodious, especially in the chorus. I like songs I can easily hum too and this song is it. I've overplayed this song already. Jon sings beautifully during the chorus. <br /> <br />13. Seen It All (8/10) - I have no idea what to make of this song. On some listens, I like it and on other listens, I don't. It's another slow song that at points can get boring. I think this song should have been replaced with one of the songs on the bonus disc, preferably Eaten Up Inside. <br /> <br />14. Tearjerker (8/10) - *sigh* I really, really want to be head over heels in love with this song but I just can't. It doesn't hold a candle to Dirty or My Gift to You. These lyrics are so odd. What do you mean you need someone to love you? You're married, Jonathan. It's just too stripped down for my tastes. <br /> <br />Overall, this is the freshest KoRn has sounded since their self-titled masterpiece. After losing Head, I was worried about what would emerge and it looks like the boys have done quite nicely. Munky has really stepped it up in the guitar department; David finally showcases some of the talent he displayed on KoRn and Life is Peachy; Jonathan's vocals are the most polished they've ever been. Overall, this album is a keeper and is recommended to any KoRn fan and any fan of rock music in general if only just for a listen.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I have many Directors' Cuts in my DVD collection, many I really like and enjoy seeing orginal vision, extras scenes (Brazil, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings) but then there's the ones that should have been left alone. (Abyss, Star Wars) I'm not complaining about the special editions because I take offense at my precious Star Wars being changed from how I remember seeing it 100 times when I was a kid. As a filmmaker I take offense to Lucas making changes that look bad, change characters and are just down right stupid. There is actually changes I like. I love the extended Wampa scene in Empire. I like seeing the windows in Cloud City. So let's take a look: <br /> <br />Star Wars: Mos Eisley scenes just look bad. Jabba doesn't look like Jabba. Han firing first, you just changed his whole character. Han is a badass. He would fire first. He spends most of the film looking out for himself. It's great to see the arc of going from self-centered jerk to someone who actually cares. I'm tired of directors getting older and wimpier. I'm surprised that he didn't CG the guns out of everyones hands. And if you're 'fixing' all this stuff why is Luke's saber still white/yellow on board the Falcon? The attack on the Death Star was great and I actually like that. <br /> <br />Empire: like the Wampa, like Cloud City. Luke screaming in terror when he purposefully throws himself off the platform?!? Talk about changing character. Thank God he took it back out in the Special Special edition.  <br /> <br />Jedi: I was so mad when I started watching this I turned it off and didn't finish it for a year. That crappy computer animated rap scene with the band was bad enough, but Bobba Fett hanging out like a cowboy in a saloon and giving the dancing girl a little knock on the chin. What!? Soooo bad. Not to mention the technical slap in the face George gives to everyone who busted their hump creating puppets and perfroming in the orginal. It doesn't even visually blend with the look of the original film. I'm not that bothered by Hayden inserted other than the fact that it's a reminder of how bad the new movies are. Not that I'm a fan of Ewoks or the yub-yub celebration but the new ending is even worse not to mention that it once again doesn't match the look of the film. <br /> <br />The transfers look great, but these just serves to demonstrate how bad the new ones look and how out of place the CG looks in comparison.  The orginals may have been using 'antiquated' techniques but a REAL model of a starship and a REAL puppet of Yoda, look REAL on film. Yoda isn't even identifiable as Yoda in the new films.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I'm going to start off by saying that Korn's original sound has been ripped off by so many other bands they had no choice but to change it up. However, I am somewhat dissappointed with the new sound they've created. It's far too industrial and not gritty like the Korn of years past. They do pull it off at times with songs like Twisted Transistor and Coming Undone. Coming Undone is by far the best song on the album and one of Korn's best ever. Flaws are freckled throughout the album, mostly with Jonathan's singing. Musically the real hero on the album is Munky, keep in mind he's doing the job of two people now and on most of the tracks he pulls it off nicely. David's drumming is also worth complementing, I'm glad he finally went to the double bass. Speaking of bass Fieldy is the major dissappointment, he just doesn't fit in at all with the new sound. Personally I feel that \\"Issues\\" was Korn's moment in the spotlight as well as their best work. It seems that since \\"Untouchables\\" was released every Korn album is half filler. The problem with most hard rock bands is the fact that once they've created a unique sound it's very hard for them to change it. I feel the only band that has done this effectively and succeeded is Metallica. Korn is a great band that to this day still rocks live, but like many other hard rock bands they are finding it difficult to evolve musically. \\"See you on the other side\\" isn't a bust nor is it a great album. If you are a die hard Korn fan I say buy it and expect to enjoy it, but if you're expecting hard, gritty Korn, they no longer exist. (Forgot to mention: despite the long pause in the middle \\"Open Up\\" is one of the better slow songs Korn has done)
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first thing I noticed when I started reading reviews of OK Computer were several prominent reviews complaining about the fact that it used to have a 5-star rating, but has dropped to 4.5.  The second thing I noticed was that as of my writing, there were 1,830 reviews.  Wow.  That means almost 2000 people were moved enough by this album one way or another to write a review about it. <br /> <br />I've been a Radiohead fan since the first time I heard \\"Creep\\" circa 1994.  I've followed them ever since, but didn't really dive in deep until this album came out. <br /> <br />OK Computer was unlike anything else before it.  The Bends hinted at the greatness to come, but OK Computer fulfilled the promise.  This is along the lines of a Sgt. Pepper or Thriller-esque paradigm shift in music.  Say what you will about The Beatles or Michael Jackson (I won't tell you which one I *am* a fan of), but the fact is that these artists made a huge impact on everybody that followed.  Perhaps it's too early to say whether or not Radiohead has done or will do the same, but I'm fairly certain  we will look back in another 10 years or so and find that it was indeed the case. <br /> <br />I won't bother to compare Radiohead to other artists.  Amazon can do that for you.  If, however, you want to gather together a collection of music with profound impact and revolutionary concepts for their time, you'd be remiss to exclude this album from your collection. <br /> <br />For a minute there, I lost myself...
B0006IIPIK|3.0|\\"Sky Captain\\" does more than tip its hat to German expressionist film and to the old serials; it is filmed as if a 1930s vintage Flash Gordon serial were a newsreel rather than fantasy.  The art direction is astounding, and shows off a huge amount of technical mastery and creativity.  Jude Law is perfect as Sky Captain, and Gwyneth Paltrow pulls off the Polly Perkins role as well, which I hadn't expected given her background as a \\"serious\\" actress.  Giovanni Ribisi steals the show as Dex.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  Despite all the action, the great art and the quality of the performances, \\"Sky Captain\\" is generally listless and uninvolving.  \\"Indiana Jones\\" attempted something similar with a different kind of serial, and succeeded in part because of the sense of fun of the movie overall.  That sense of fun is generally missing from \\"Sky Captain.\\"<br /><br />This is well worth viewing once, and you will probably enjoy it, but you might not be inclined to add this to your permanent collection.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Isn't this already out?  LOL, I just don't get this.<br /><br />Great movie!  One of the roughest scenes to experience is Tony Montana's (Scarface) brother being cut up by a chainsaw in the bathtub while he is forced to watch.  GIVES ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES thinking about it.  Definitely a good deterrant on not joining in on a life in crime.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie will undoubtedly become one of the must see films for generations to come just like the other classics we all grown to watch year after year.  My children are ages 2 through 11, and my wife and I sat down and watched this movie with them all in one sitting.  This movie has something for everyone:  music, suspense, action - while also having a very good plot and story line.  The animation was fantastic, the story good, and the ending very well done.  Was it true to the book? I wouldn't know myself, but my two oldest children said once or twice \\"hey, that wasn't in the book.\\"  Oh well to that, but I can say that it is a great movie and well worth watching.
B000C20VPA|5.0|I know what you mean John.  I don't understand why they do this.  It has to be the same version that we both bought about six months ago.  Could it be that they switched distributors maybe?  I have no idea.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I Actually bought this album with high hopes and was innitially disapointed.  I was hoping for more of the classic Green Day or possibly something like Warning but thought this album was a little too mellow.  I left this CD in the back of the Green Day section of my CD case until about a month ago when for some reason I took it out and gave it one more try.  This album is the best musically of any Green Day album.  They have taken the musical advancements they made in Warning and solidified their sound to produce an anthemic punk album that harkens to the likes of Bad Religion or the Dead Kennedy's Something that Green Day has never done.  The album stays very Green Day with a reliance on catchy riffs and simplistic chord progresions but has dramatic anti-war undertones that may not be apparent on the first few listens.  Billie Joe has transformed himself from the skate-punk snot nosed punker to the aged socially concious force that broadcasts throughout the mainstream media.  This album is important because it has been all over the top 40 lists with several songs.  These songs although not punk have brought punk's true message of social responsibility to the masses.  Punk has changed over the years and Green Day has managed to put forth an album that has reached many non-punkers with the old messages of the early punk movement.  Something that better punk bands have never quite achieved.  This album shows that Green Day has managed to re-invent themselves again into a political group much like a mellow Anti-Flag.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|After 5 long years, Enya has finally released a new and once again landmark album. This is truly a beautiful and inspiring work of art. The collection of tracks on Amarantine presents a softer grace and quietness about them than the more charismatic and pop sounding tracks found on her previous two albums. I feel that the music on this album closely resembles that of her earlier work on \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons,\\" which is the sound that I love the most from Enya. However, the music on \\"Amarantine\\" seems to focus more on Enya's vocals and a bit less on the atmosphere, which is a noticeable change from her previous works and something that I personally miss. But, the richness and maturity of these compositions will hold much longer over time than the pieces on \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" for example, which due to a more \\"pop\\" nature seem to lack solid musical structure.<br /><br />\\"Amarantine\\" also features three songs sung in a new language created by lyricist Roma Ryan called, Loxian. Loxian has been described by Enya as \\"a futuristic language from a distant planet.\\" Roma Ryan has written a book that is due in late December called, \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart,\\" that explores the language and its people in detail. She explains that the Loxian people are much like us, \\"They're in space, somewhere in the night. They're looking out, they're mapping the stars, and wondering if there is anyone else out there. It's to do with that concept: are we alone in the Universe?\\" In Gaelic, the term is basically translated as, \\"the people that come from the Moon.\\" \\"Amarantine\\" features one other song containing text in a different language from English and that is \\"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet),\\" which is the first piece Enya has sung in Japanese. Also for the first time, there are no songs sung in her native Gaelic tongue.<br /><br />The name Amarantine is taken from the word, amaranthine, which means everlasting beauty that never fades. It is also a term to describe a deep red color, which I presume matches the outfit Enya wears on the cover of this album.<br /><br />Enya's \\"Amarantine\\" is definitely an album that I highly recommend. Any long time fan of Enya will certainly agree. Her music can inspire even the least artistic to dream in ways never thought imaginable.olor, which I presume matches the outfit Enya wears on the cover of this album. <br /> <br />Enya's \\"Amarantine\\" is definitely an album that I highly recommend.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard answers the age old question, Where Do Faded Hollywood Doves Go To Die? in truly greusome detail as we meet one Miss Norma Desmond.  Technically this is my most favorite picture of all time.  Norma Desmond is one truly twisted sister a fictional old film star now past it yet looking for her come back.  The movies are in her old tired blood and she seeks a close up like a heroin addict hunts for their next drug fix.  Norma Desmond courts that most elusive prey called youth and let me tell you this film chronicles the hunt which is driving her and all who surround her quite and quietly mad.<br /><br />Norma is yet another aging former star, a victim of that all too real Hollywood malady of beleiving her own press,  Norma in her heyday sowed the wind in treating people like dirt and reaped the worldwind as Hollywood disgarded her like yesterdays news when the wrinkles showed up and the glamour wore off.  Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond because she was old enough to remember silent pictures and she had the exzagerated hand gesticulations and facial contortions used in the silent move era to convey feelings in a time before Talkies.<br /><br />Again if what I shared with you thus far was all there was to this movie it would be fun to watch but oh no.  Norma Desmond not only wants to re-energize her dead film career she wants a boy toy to replace the now dead monkey and friend she lives with in her faded dusty mansion that looks like a cross between a haunted house set, mad house and a large dusty tomb.  The film has an extra creepy feel as at the beginning you learn it is a story noir being told to you by a man now very dead.  Yes this is a story told by the dead victim of an explosive mixture of two demeanted peoples poison dreams and their immoral selfish willingness to do any wicked thing to make them come true.<br /><br />What makes Sunset Boulevard so good is that it feels so right.  Norma Desmond is such a man hungry self absorbed old babe and what started out as her lover's iron sense of dignity turns slowly into cotton candy norma consumes with a jaded passion.  Norma with all the deliberate cunning of a black widow spider slowly injects her lover with the potent venom of co-dependency which litterally eat away the kept man's backbone till he yields to her every whim for a time.  Helping Sunset Bolevard develop and keep its horrific mood is also the creepy music score which you can hear become more demented and manic as the characters lives and dignity self destruct as their tormented souls entertwine beyond hope of ever escaping each others perverse deadly embrace.<br /><br />There is plenty of dark humor in this Norma Desmonds Sunset Boulevard.  If this is a horror movie it is traggic horror.  Sunset Boulevard is certainly Psychological horror showing what twisted shallow minded people do to themselves and each other if their lusts for money, power and fame are unleashed by the proper situations.  Watching this movie is like watching to two animals eat each other alive while you the audience are enticed to take bets on which one will survive in the end.<br /><br />Finally this movie has a few mwmoriable lines too.  Her Lover says, ... \\"Hey You're Norma Desmond, You used to be BIG!\\"... To which Norma responds... I AM BIG its the picturh's that got small. and my favorite saying of all movies I have seen in life Norma's Desmonds swan song to the Camera's.<br /><br />\\"This is my life.  It always will be... There's no one else just us, the camera's and all those wonderful people out there in the dark..... Alright Mr DeMille I'm ready for my close up!\\".<br /><br />This is another of my must have DVD's.  Sunset Boulevard is serious in a weird way but in another way it is a solid black comedy laugh fest.  You have to buy Sunset Boulevard not to buy this is to cheat yourself of laughs galore.  Oh after seeing Sunset Bolevard you won't go swimming at any of Norma Desmonds Hollywood Parties unless youneed to learn how to float.  I am sure if you are a young man willing to help write Norma a sure fire career reviving come back script she will gladly give you the crash course on floating in her pool.<br /><br />Play your cards right she might take you for a ride in her dusty old car.d Parties unless you need to learn how to float.  I am sure if you are a young man willing to help write Norma a sure fire career reviving come back script she will gladly give you the crash course on floating in her pool. <br /> <br />Play your cards right she might take you for a ride in her dusty old car.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is probably the best all around concept album I have ever heard. The only things that compare are The Who's Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar. Waters' lyrics are amazing, gilmour's solos are phenomenal. Buy this album. I am 15 years old and I love it. I think this is probably one of the most underrated albums of its time. The songs are all so good that you can just sit there and listen to all of them without having to skip to your favorite tracks. I can't say that about many albums
B000BP86OG|2.0|Ughhh!....I have a headache. Let me give you my scoop on this cd.  <br />Remember when Van Halen had David Lee Roth as its frontman? The band had swagger and humor and it showed throughout from their live shows to the songs on their albums. The songs were addictive and varied as well. That era is what was found on PTL. <br />David left (as did the Darkness bassist...coincidence? Start your conspiracy theories now) and what you had then was Sammy Haggar with the band. I know a lot of people liked this version of Van Halen but I found them to be noisy, less soulful, and I considered them to be sellouts. This is the new Darkness cd. A lot is missing on this. <br />I just know Justin and the boys sat around and complained to each other that the world considered them to be a novelty and rehashing a long ago sound. They were determined to make serious music and show everyone that they were a true band. The problem is that The Darkness don't do serious well. <br />My suggestion to any Darkness fan who is lucky enough not to own this album...save your money. Remember them as they were on the first cd....cheeky and rockin'. Maybe the album title refers to their career...let's hope they make it back. <br />Now excuse me, I must run down to the used cd store and sell this to recoup some of my money before it lands next week in the cut-out bin next to all the Was (Not Was) albums.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's My Sisters Keeper, is a great book and shows the meaning of life. Sara and Brian show their concern for their sick daughter Kate, who has cancer, but they seem to forget they have two other children. Anna who is Kate's younger sister, was born purposly to \\"save\\" Kate, with body tranplants. Anna feels she is not herself, and she is caught in the middle of her family, and what she really wants for her well being.  <br /> <br />In my option I feel that Anna is being torn to do something she does not want to do. She has had no say in any of the medical procedues done to her, and i feel that is unfar. Overall this book should be read by every teenager and adult, with a sympathetic heart and is ready to hear the real truth about being a kid growing up in tough situations, such as this one.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Despite the fact people will give different stars for this album, all the reviews seem to be the same thing in general.  All i can say that hasn't been said yet is that KoRn is just as heavy as eevr, just in a new, refined way.  This album isn't all about hate and rape, but this album still contains true to life, everyday things such as: politics, love, lies, self regret....the works.  This new sound KoRn has found is definately different from anything you've heard before from KoRn.  They had their sound stolen by many bands, and now they created a new one.  Stick near the sound KoRn.  It rocks, so please check it ouy.  If you've \\"lost hope\\", give them this last chance.
B000BOH8XW|2.0|I really hate to say this but I really did not like this album.  I really love Shakira since her first on stage performance of Donde Estas on Siempre en Domingo with Raul Velasco, but she has really changed a lot.  She was this really shy-talented woman that produced songs that would have you standing up dancing.  Oral Fixation vol.2 is soooo mellow and sad that it's depressing to know that she went from pop/dance/arabic to early 80's American rock.  Shakira, you are columbian, please stop trying to be somebody your not.  Your songs will not change who you are inside, maybe just your 'appearance' but thats it.  Sorry, I only say this so maybe her next album is more 'original'.  Bring back the Shakira we danced to at home, in our cars, at work and in your concerts.  Pleeeeaase bring her back!!!
B000BVD460|2.0|I like Eminem as an artist but alot of these hits are so played out or suck. If I wanted to listen to those songs, id just grab the CD and listen to the other songs if I wanted to listen to them too. <br /> <br />Shake That is more like a Nate Dogg track. <br /> <br />Fack is the worse song EVER. Just Lose It is actually good compared to this. And people think this is funny? Psssh smh @ Eminem di*kriders. Ish aint funny, its retarded and disgusting...what is he on drugs? Nobody wants to hear about a gerbil in their ass. <br /> <br />When Im Gone is my favorite Eminem song. Those emotional songs are the truth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's not much to say that almost 1,900 people haven't said before me about how great this series is - alternately hilarious and heart-wrenching (and not always where you most expect it), brilliantly written, impeccably acted by nine people who make you care deeply about each character, beautifully designed, photographed and directed.... In a word, inspired, and possibly the best series that has ever appeared on television. I'm sorry it took so long for me to believe a friend and buy the DVDs. (Thank you, \\"Serenity,\\" which finally pushed me over the edge.) And now, like so many others, I'm evangelical on the subject of \\"Firefly.\\" Even if it stretches my Christmas budget, everyone who might conceivably be interested is going to get a copy. Keep the chain going, reach critical mass, and the powers that be might bring it back!
B000BGH22W|3.0|As with every \\"Harry Potter\\" soundtrack in the past, I was truly looking forward to the release of \\"The Goblet of Fire\\". When I saw that John Williams was not the composer, I have to admit my disappointment. After listening to the complete score for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised with the orchestral part. The music that heralds the arrival of different players in the track entitled \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" was definitely my favorite cut. The use of an Eastern European flair for Viktor Krum resonates power and strength. But as with most every review, with every good part there must also be the bad. Why-oh-why did they include vocal tracks on this soundtrack? And not only vocal tracks, but BAD vocal tracks. With the very opening of \\"Do The Hippogriff\\", I knew that I was in store for an unpleasant listening experience. The singer literally screams at the beginning. After seeing the movie and seeing the portion of the film where the songs are performed, I still cannot figure out WHY it was included in the soundtrack. It was OK for the song to be in the film because we got to see the kids be kids and have fun (for the most part) together. But to have a beautifully orchestrated piece of cinematic music immediately followed by a below-mediocre singer screaming, just does not make the least bit of sense.  <br />In closing, my copy of the \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" soundtrack will soon be at the local CD re-seller. Perhaps if they make a compilation CD of all four movies and it does not include the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" vocal tracks, I will buy a copy of it. If I could just rate the orchestral portion of the soundtrack, I would give it 4 1/2 stars. Patrick Doyle follows the John Williams legacy and does the music great justice. The vocal tracks I could not even give 1/2 of a star. It is like trying to put a square block into a round hole. It just does not fit.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I watched the pilot of this show, and it was soo good, i was hooked. I really like the change of direction in the show. (not fighting gould(sp?) all the time) The actors they picked are great, everyone is fun and loveable. There are some characters that don't appear as much in some of the eppisodes, but its ok because they have their spotlight on other eppisodes. The new army guy with his O'neil-esque attitude toward the science of things, is great and not a cheezy character rip-off; he's dumb in his own way. :) The whole idea of this show is like a upgrade from stargate, well more of a \\"we have advanced technology but don't know what to do with it\\" compared to the \\"we have primitive earth stuff, and some high tech stuff here and there\\" type of setting. <br /> <br />I'm completely satisfied with this product.
B000002TQV|5.0|i'll be brief....: <br /> <br /> <br />The Bends is definetly a Radiohead masterpeice. <br />There isnt a single bad song on The Bends. <br /> <br />Track List: <br />1.Planet Telex-10/10- a great intro track. <br /> <br />2.the Bends-10/10- Great track about the bands attempt to \\"bend\\" their success with \\"creep\\". <br /> <br />3.High and Dry-9/10-good music, fantastic lyrics from yorke. <br /> <br />4.Fake Plastic Trees-11/10- one of radiohead's gold medal moments, along with Paranoid Android and Pryamid Song. <br /> <br />5.Bones-7/10-Weakest song on the album, but hey! 7 out of 10 aint bad! Its a great rocker, features some of Greenwoods famous \\"abusive\\" guitar riffs. <br /> <br />6.(Nice Dream)-10/10-Unlike many other people, I personally love this track. Contains loads of dreamy guitar chords, until the distortion breaks in and greenwood takes over. <br /> <br />7.just-10/10-So damn catchy. This is definetly the song to play to people who have never heard radiohead before. <br /> <br />8.My Iron Lung-10/10- The Iron Single! Has a kinda Insanity feeling to it, until the distortion breaks in and all hell breaks loose! Sveet!(im german... i think) <br /> <br />9.Bullet Proof...i wish i was:9/10- The most depressing song on the bends. Its actually a great emotional song. I shoulda gave it 10 points....whatever. <br /> <br />10.Black Star-10/10- Not much i can say here. Great Lyrics,  <br />catchy melody. <br /> <br />11.Sulk- 10 or 9?/10 - i cant decide on this one. Its a great song no doubt, but it sounds very familiar to black star. <br /> <br />12.Street Spririt (fade out)-10/10- Ill admit i didnt like this song very much as first, but it grew on me like hell. Its very dark and visual. Just listen to it. <br /> <br /> <br />so yeah...you cant go wrong with the bends. Buy it. <br /> <br />If your going to introduce somebody to Radiohead, have them buy the following albums in the following order. <br /> <br />1.the Bends <br />2.OK Computer <br />3.Kid A <br />4.Hail to the theif <br />5.Amnesiac or Pablo honey or whatever....im bored, why am i listing this???? i have no life....damn....ok....yea...cya
B000002JSN|5.0|Think of it like a movie on record. Theres magic here.<br /><br />This is the album the band relesed shortly after their contract with THE DEVIL ran out. They would not resign with him (and coincidentally would not acheive the likes of these days ever again, ever.) It was a bold move, resulting in tragedy, drug addictions, deaths etc.<br /><br />PHYSICAL GRAFFITI captures the essence of those last days with the dark lord; their return to earth; and the hardships of becoming humans again. The whole adventure is a wild one and this album should NOT BE PASSED UP!<br /><br />My fave picks are these:<br /><br />THE ROVER: The best zep riff rocker, not epic, just ROCK!<br /><br />IN MY TIME: bluesy epic, way cooler than Kashmir.<br /><br />TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT: SO VERY good. You will be transfixed by this riff.<br /><br />IN THE LIGHT: trippy intro, rockin song, killer lyrics (disc two is everywhere, suitably starts here)<br /><br />DOWN BY THE SEASIDE: The next stop on the trip, lighter fare, but it gets heavy in the middle.<br /><br />TEN YEARS GONE: One of the most beautiful songs ever. I always hated THANK YOU and even more THE RAIN SONG (yuck) but this is the best answer to those. Much, a mood setter.<br /><br />BOOGIE WITH STU: OH ROCK ROCK ROCK!<br /><br />BLACK COUNTRY WOMAN: Great bluesy moosey! This was recorded outside, you hear that plane going by? Plant said to leave the tapes running and ripped this one out. Its excellent work by all.<br /><br />This is the last HUGE ZEP album. On a sidenote this album in my opinion is best listened to on a dark and gloomy Winters day, for some reason the mood is greatly enhanced then.<br /><br />THATS ENOUGH FROM ME!<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: Just believe and you can't go wrong; in the light, you will find the road.
B00000IGGA|5.0|i must admit that it took me awhile to get used to tom waits' voice.but once i got to see the person in films such as \\"down by law\\" and \\"coffee and cigarettes\\",both films in which i recommend,i became more intrigued and gave him more of an open-mind and a listen.this my first experience with waits is a brilliant one.the music on these songs,especially the more upbeat ones are scat personified.waits is brilliant for many reasons but the main reason is that he is seperate from the rest as he sits perched in his own little circle of talent.i wish that i had gotten into waits sooner because i know that he's been making music since the '70's and there is so much more territory that i've yet to explore.personal highlights on this album for me are in a class of their own.\\"big in japan\\" starts the disc perfectly,followed by \\"lowside of the road\\",\\"hold on\\",and \\"get behind the mule\\".my favorite track,eventhough i liked his performance of it better on \\"storytellers\\" has to be \\"what's he building?\\" it is my favorite track on the album and my favorite so far of his.the song is about how we all think about our neighbors.it reminds me of that brilliant twilight zone episode of the neighborhood that suddenly loses all power.i recommend this album and this man to anyone with an open-mind as the close-minded wouldn't understand how to appreciate such a gifted artist.count me in.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Let me cut to the chase.... <br />If you don't like movies with monkeys or gorillas (giant ones at that!) tearing up a city and scaring people, <br />If you don't like classic films from before color, <br />If you only like your special effects to be digitally done, <br />... Then this movie isn't for you. <br />On the other hand, if that kind of stuff is \\"your bag\\", then this movie is a cinematic marvel. <br /> <br />Rather than go on about the movie itself though, because you can read any of the other reviews about it, let me talk about the special features. <br />The feature on Merian C. Cooper was amazing. This guy was what gonzo film-making was all about before they even coined that term! <br />He had a vision that was ahead of his time when it came to movies. <br /> <br />Then there's the recreation by Peter Jackson of the long lost \\"Spider sequence\\". If he put this much effort into recreating a piece of film that's been lost forever, I can't wait to see his version of King Kong when it hits the theaters! <br />Him and his crew put alot of effort into this sequence, and they came away with a profound appreciation for the pioneers who set the standards in the early years of film making. <br /> <br />I have loved this movie since I was a kid. <br />It's got action, suspense, \\"mushy-romance\\" and a big freakin' GIANT MONKEY for crying out loud! What's not to like?! <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and at least borrow this movie from a friend if you don't want to buy it. <br />Curl up on the couch with some popcorn and just have a blast! <br />

By the time you get to the end of the book, you just cannot put it down. <br />Jodi's novel is not only unpredictable but it allows the reader to put themselves in with this famil, undergoing their pain and happiness along with them.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I was a bit leery when I heard a new man artist was going to score the soundtrack to GOF since I had become used to John Williams. But I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved the new direction the music went. It was PERFECT for the atmosphere, a little darker, a little more bombastic and edgy, and mournful exactly when it needed to be. The music composed for the Yule Ball waltz was also absolutely beautiful, even if the dance it self was crazy fast! And I am not ashamed to admit that the score playing during Cedric's death always makes me cry like a baby. A huge round of applause also to the \\"Weird Sisters\\" for their contributions, especially Magic Works, which would be a perfect \\"last dance\\" song for any occasion. I salute you, Mr. Doyle, for a job well done.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|Argentinean-American Gusto Santaolalla has an ear for simple, sparse, but romantic background music.  \\"Snow\\", \\"Riding Horses\\", \\"The Wings\\" and the title song are all original and worthy pieces of work, but they are all too short, clocking in at a minute or two each.  That's a disappointment, as any extended version would be welcome.  The contributions from Emmylou Harris, Rufus Wainwright, Jackie Green and Willie Nelson are all perfect choices for an early 1960's western.  Only Linda Ronstadt seems out of place with her pop rock entry.  It's a good soundtrack, but it just doesn't live up to the grandeur deserved for such a fine film.  Teddy Thompson and Rufus Wainwright's cover duet of Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road\\", is a special treat.
B0007GAERG|1.0|I was FORCED to listen to this cd on a trip with a hoochie mama. Why oh why does Mariah have to sing the scales on EVERY song?? Finally after several plays we stoped at a gas station and when the hootchie went to get some fried pork rinds, I tossed this TRASH cd along the 101.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|My favorite version of PF included David, Roger, Nick and Rick, and I'd be thrilled if they reformed to record again.  Never cared much for the Syd stuff but I have immense respect for those that do.  Pulse and Delicate Sounds of Thunder are sorely missing Roger's vocals, but the situation is what it is and I am still very grateful to have a PF dvd involving the other three.  And were they generous with the extras on this dvd or what?? <br /> <br />May I also suggest Roger Waters solo cd's, especially The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.  Eric Clapton's guitar is great... A superb cd. <br /> <br />Someone called David Gilmour a session guitarist?  Wow that's like calling the bible a paperback book, or Pink Floyd's The Wall \\"just a cd\\"!  That man plays the most emotional guitar I've ever heard, and his voice is perfect for Floyd (along with Roger's).   And as for Roger Waters, what an incredible writer, and his voice is unique and outstanding!  I cannot begin to say how many times and to what depth his voice, lyrics and music have deeply, deeply touched my soul like no other music.   <br /> <br />I salute all of Pink Floyd - Syd, Roger, Nick, Rick and David! <br />God bless them all and may we be blessed with more of their recordings!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I want it.  I'll have it.  End of discussion.  I've had the VHS for years.  It's excellent.
B000003TA4|5.0|What I mean by the title of this review is nothing on this album was complex or musically inclined. What I mean was the impact it had with such a distinct \\"sound\\". Kurt Cobain's trademark yell and the sound of his guitar's made the album groundbreaking and an unquenchable thirst for teens in the so called \\"Gen X\\". <br /> <br />You can tell The Pixies were a big influence as well as the Melvins, Black Flag and Minor Threat. A combination of these sounds is what led to the zeitgeist hit \\"Nevermind\\". <br /> <br />Although I believe that the songs on this album are just simple beats with awkward lyrics, the power of Cobain's voice and his guitars are what made this album such a groundbreaker.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I have been a very critical fan of Madonna since the beginning. <br />I really like this CD. It is very light and positive- which is what the world needs now. The only song I did not like was \\" I love New York\\". The melody needs depth.  I noticed that some people really posted very negative comments about this album. Well , let the sales speak for themselves........ <br />Modonna went back to her roots and it worked- True, it does sound very 80's and it is not rap (which I do like a great deal) <br />but it is a welcome change from most of what we hear now which all sounds about the same.  <br />I do think this will be far more liked in Europe than the U.S. but that is ok. I promise you there will be more artists taking a step back in time and create more CD's like this. Face it, you can't help but move your body to it. It also does not create any negativity- I am all for that.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|It isn't that it is the most disgusting music I have ever heard, but there is just no edge to this music or anything that makes it stand out from music that anyone could make. No outstanding musicianship, no great melodies, structure or lyrics. This CD pretty much defines boring. There is much better music out there for anyone willing to take the time to look for it.
0743454537|3.0|The controversial story that was brought about in \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" made it a wonder to read.  The chapters and views of each person in the story made reading the book go by smoothly. This was a touching book and very deep full of drama and pain. The family within the story tries to keep itself together through tough times.  The book gets progesivley better as you read it. It was a well written book with a unique story line, but a little too depressing in my opinion.
B000AP04FG|1.0|...this movie to be this bad. I am amazed at the number of people that loved the film and even more so at the critics that selected it as a \\"DVD of the Month\\" for November.  <br />Now I can suspend disbelief  as much as the next guy, but to expect me to accept that a: a couple of assassins-for-hire can decide to kill each other just because they're dissatisfied in their marriage, b: that highly secret U.S. government agencies can declare violent war on each other, c: and fight that war openly in a high rise building during business hours, then carry that war to a department store, not open for business but where are the local cops when all that loud gunfire is going on? and d: the couple calmly visits their marriage counselor after all is said and done to show how much reconciliation is possible after you kill several of the people you ostensibly once worked with and oh, by the way, aren't you concerned that those agencies are still looking for you? And there you are holding hands and beaming at your shrink?  <br />An amazingly stupid film on the illogical level of \\"Minority Report\\" and \\"The Art of War\\", films with plot holes so large they simply can't be ignored.  <br />I can't believe I actually BOUGHT \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" instead of renting it.        <br />Do yourself a favor: rent it first...you might just save yourself some money. <br />
0684824906|5.0|Ms. Goodwin has outdone herself this time. I have cradled this book gently, reading a few pages a night to make it last longer. I had always indulged a bit of curiousity about the characters in Lincoln's cabinet, and read a bit about different ones from time to time, but Goodwin has brought it all to one place and put each of them in perspective. Like most Lincoln authors, she ignores the Great Sioux uprising of 1862, and Lincoln's active engagement in it, but that is a minor quibble. This will become required reading for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War.
B00000DFSK|2.0|My guess is that it HAD to be someone who was born around, say, 1982, because there's just NO WAY anyone who was really listening to this band during the mid to late 80's would have found these tracks to be the most endearing. What happened to all of the meaty, gritty, I-Wanna-Go-Fight-For-Ireland songs that made U2 such a phenom band??? Where did all of the gutsy, emotional tracks go? <br />Anyone who calls themselves a fan or who would like to make a single purchase to listen to what made these guys so great would gladly have shelled out a few extra beans for a 2 disc set. Lord knows U2 has more than enough songs from this time frame to fill up 2 CDs and then some! <br />Among the obvious MIA tracks are: <br />{Boy} I Will Follow, Stories For Boys, & Out of Control <br />{A Sort of Homecoming} Wire and Bad <br />{War} Two Hearts Beat As One <br />{Joshua Tree} Bullet the Blue Sky, Running To Stand Still, & In God's Country. <br />Come on... do this right next time! <br />As for me, I was looking for a compiled CD of this nature to give my son for Christmas. He is just becoming really interested in good music & I think he's finally ready to appreciate the greatness that is U2. I think I'll just burn a disc from my own library instead because this mix comes up way too short.
B000003TA4|4.0|I think everyone goes through a Nirvana phase at some point. In early adolescence, nothing channels your frustration like the powerful attack of Kurt, Krist and Dave. For a time, Nirvana is the greatest band in the world. Then you grow up a little, listen again, and realize that they were making fun of kids like you all along. You have a good chuckle, dig the album out from time to time, and place other bands atop the pantheon of rock and roll.    To be sure, there's lots to love about Nevermind. From the clever mockery of Boston's \\"More Than A Feeling\\" on \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to the haunting licks of \\"Come As You Are\\" and the manic drumrolls throughout, this album contains many classic moments. Great bands emerge partly from the distinctness of each member, and Nirvana fulfills this prerequisite easily. Krist Nivoselic provides fluid and melodic basslines, and David Grohl, though not technically exceptional, attacks the drums with incredible force and command. Kurt fulfills his role by regularly stumbling onto unforgettable hooks.    At its best, Nirvana is an unstoppable force of raw power and wit. Few bands approach rock with such economy and purpose. When the opening chords of \\"In Bloom\\" crash through my stereo, I know that every sound the band makes will be deliberate and significant. The album's best song, \\"Lithium,\\" sychronizes simple mellow strumming with a fantastic crescendo, wicked snarling, and some of Kurt's most ironic and clever lyrics.    Given this high praise, why do I not give this album five stars? There are two main reasons. The first is that the band does not maintain its high standard throughout the entire record. \\"Breed,\\" \\"Territorial Pissings\\" and \\"Stay Away\\" are virtually the same song, and \\"Lounge Act\\" and \\"On a Plain\\" also bear uncomfortable resemblance to one another. Attempts to incorporate some punk authenticity into the record, they sound like B-sides that never received full consideration or development. Some people view \\"Polly\\"and \\"Something in the Way\\" as brilliant and haunting ballads; I find that on this record they reveal the one-dimensionality of Cobain's voice. When I listen to a truly great album, I find that each listen gives me a new understanding of some element or sublety that I hadn't noticed before. That quality is missing from Nevermind. It is good, angry music for the car, but does not really reward multiple listens.    The album's other major flaw comes from Kurt Cobain's inner turmoil. Much as he wanted to challenge the shallow focus of pop music at the time, he wrote music that was ultimately as meaningless as what came before it. Nihilism does not make for good listening. Cobain does not rail against the system, does not call for an uprising of the underprivileged, nor does he celebrate what's right with the world. Nevermind is as silly and flippant as its title suggests. The lyrics \\"Love myself better than you/I know it's wrong/What should I do,\\" sarcastic or not, simply cannot have emotional resonance. It's a shame that a band with so much talent squandered it making a meaningless record.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I guess I love this movie 'cause I love the martial arts and sword fighting. But really, the storyline is very entertaining also. It is the story of a woman assasin who, basically, gets revenge. She was beaten and put in a coma for four years on her wedding day in El Paso, Texas and had everyone in the wedding close to her (family and husband) killed by a group she was once a part of called the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad.  <br /> <br />She awakes once again four years later from the coma and seeks revenge on the DVAS. The opening scene is very graphic in black and white and shows her getting shot in the head by a man in which we do not see the face of named Bill until the second movie. (Bill is kind of the leader of the assasins and the one she mostly wants to kill). To shorten this up a little more, we first see her battle an old assasin code named Vernita Green; she kills her in front of her daughter without knowing it. We then see that she then awakes from the coma and gets back to her car after killing a guy named Buck who was a friend of Bill's at a hospital. She then gets back to her car and as she tries to move all her toes to make her legs stable again. <br /> <br />We then learn about Oren Ishii, a half Japanese half American woman code named Cottonmouth from the squad, and how she became an assasin, and also one of the best. Oren's my favorite :). She then flies to Okinawa and meets Hattori Hanzo in a cafe, saying she has vermin to kill and needs Japanese steel. A month later, Hanzo creates his best sword he has ever made and gives it to her. Then we meet Oren's own clan in Japan, with frightening, intimidating characters such as Gogo, a seventeen year old crazy girl, Johnny Mo, leader of Oren's army the Crazy 88, and Sophie Fatale, who really is not intimidating or frightening but took part in the cruel beatings of the Bride (who's real name is revealed in the second movie). <br /> <br />Then, the best part of the movie comes. The Bride arrives at areally cool restuarant/club place called the House of Blue Leaves where Oren and her top members are partying. She then, after a very dramatic part in which Sophie's arm is cut off, battles and de-limbs and kills all 88 of the Crazy 88 and more. \\"But leave the limbs you lost...they belong to me now\\"-a great line from the movie. <br /> <br />Then she battles Oren in the pretty scenery out in the back of the House of Blue Leaves, a very, very serious and dramtatic and great part. But of course I'm not giving away the ending! All I can say is this is one of my fave movies and it is sooooooooo cool. <br /> <br />If you cannot handle very graphic blood in almost every scene and I MEAN THIS IS REALLY REALLY BLOODY I AM WARNING YOU, then do not see this. If you do not like seeing women or young girls in pain do not see this. There is a very graphic anime scene, so if you cannot take that stuff it won't appeal to you. There is some language, too, that shouldn't be heard by nine year olds, lol. Other than that, if you can handle all that, you can watch this and you'll like it. <br /> <br />For all the people complaining about the blood, did you not see the box in which it depicted a woman with a sword? THE BLOOD IS SUPPOSED TO ADD DRAMA AND MORE REALITY. If someone gets their limbs cut off, there's going to be a whole lot of blood. <br /> <br />And to the people who are complaining about how \\"it's so unrealistic that she can possibly kill 88 and more people without dying\\" although I do agree it's not likely IT IS A MOVIE and some are realistic and some are not, but this one mostly is. <br /> <br />Overall, five stars. I'm actually thirteen but I was allowed to see this movie 'cause I'm pretty mature. When I first saw this, I wasn't sure if I really liked it either. I had never seen a movie with so much blood and gore before, but after I watched it again, I realized it was a very clever movie and behind the blood was an amazing story. <br /> <br />This IS a good movie if youcan handle it. <br /> <br />You have to see it!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have been at times a rabid Johnny Cash fan (especially after seeing him in concert at Toad's Place in New Haven--extraordinary by any standard) and at times I have run luke warm on him (after hearing \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" for the millionth time). I have always respected his authenticity and have always loved his incredible voice, but I was never sure whether or not he was \\"the true vine\\" (Hank Williams and Waylon Jennings were absolutely the true vine, as is Billy Joe Shaver) of country music or just a very talented and very lucky (in terms of commercial acceptance of his music) country songwriter and singer.<br /><br />That question was answered for me one afternoon when the music director at the noncommercial FM radio station where I do a weekly show handed me an extra copy of \\"American IV:  The Man Comes Around.\\" Hearing this album for the first time was one of the most emotional experiences I've had in 40 plus years of listening to music seriously. I was devastated, floored, overwhelmed.<br /><br />Cash's version of \\"Hurt\\" is unbelievable. It is the most jarring raw emotion that I've ever heard on an album. I used to think only Van Morrison could send those kinds of chills up my spine: Cash topped him easily. And to be able to take a piece of radio wasteland like \\"Desperado\\" and turn it into a gut-wrenching story-song that even Tom Waits, I'm sure, would be staggered by, proves to me that yes, Johnny Cash is the true vine of country music. This man is the real deal. His version of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" must even widen the eyes of Art Garfunkel. It's simply amazing. But the song that will rip your heart out if you are any kind of Cash fan is his cover of \\"We'll Meet Again.\\"<br /><br />A few weeks later I was on a photo assignment in Nevada and listened to the album constantly (I brought a dozen CDs with me, but I needn't have bothered) for a week. If you want to hear this album in its full depth, fly out to Las Vegas, rent a Taurus for a week and drive across the desert for twelve hours a day. Somehow the loneliness of that environment matches this album. It was like having Cash beside me in the car. Again, even \\"Desperado\\" a song that I wish had never gotten ruined by overplay on commercial radio, was so riveting I had to play it over and over.<br /><br />That Cash was nearly alone in the studio when he recorded much of this CD is very obvious: this is a man saying goodbye to his old friends, and to himself.<br /><br />The next time I was on the radio I went on the air and said that I was going to play some songs from the best album I'd ever heard. My listeners know me as a wall-climbing Van Morrison fan, so I'm sure they thought it was something new from The Man. But it was this Cash album. Of course, Cash died about the same time that the album came out, I think, so it became his musical epilogue. So be it. How many artists go out with the best work of their careers warm in their hands--especially after a 50 year career?<br /><br />My feelings about this album remain. Though I find it difficult to listen to because it evokes a lot of saddness and very coarse and raw-nerve emotions, it remains the single best album I've ever heard.<br /><br />Johnny Cash is not only the real deal, but with this album he broke the mold. Do I like the album? Yeah, kind of :)<br /><br />Jeff Wignall<br />WPKN Radio (Bridgeport, CT)<br /><br />Author, The Joy of Digital Photographye hours a day.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|Really: is there anything so wonderful in all the world as Deadly Giant Robots?<br /><br />If you're like me, the answer is: NO! Giant Robots are the cat's pyjamas, any day of the week. And you'll find them in spades, and in all shapes and sizes, in the brilliantly retro \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", among other joys, dark and light.<br /><br />Lightest of all is the artistry with which first-time director Kerry Conran (happily tinkering away on \\"John Carter of Mars\\") and effects/cinematography chief Eric Adkins and Mike Navarro have crafted this visual feast, which is so seamless, and harkens back so powerfully and nostalgically to the 1930's Golden Age of Cinema, that \\"Sky Captain\\" demands nothing less than to be seen in a gilded movie palace.<br /><br />If that can't be arranged, you're still in for a treat. You've got plummy Gwyneth Paltrow playing the plummier Polly Perkins, saving that single exposure for the shot of the century while evading Giant Killer Robots on Park Avenue.<br /><br />You've got the mostly bland but spit-and-polish swashbuckling of Jude Law (Sky Captain himself), dogfighting with Deadly Giant Flying Robots in his P-51 and keeping that scarf flying back over his shoulder.<br /><br />You've got Angelina Jolie as the airborne black widow spider of the piece (and femme fatale, natch) Captain \\"Franky\\" Cook. Piloting the huge, lumbering sky carriers and well-armed attack submersibles, kitted out in a form-fitting black uniform complete with peaked cap and jackboots.<br /><br />Oh, and she's got an eyepatch. Oh, yes.<br /><br />If that's not enough to sell you alone, you've got a race against the clock to locate the mysterious Doctor Totenkopf (Lawrence Olivier brought back from the Dead through the alchemy and black magic of high technology!) in his secret lair, before he can destroy the planet with his rampaging army of Deadly Giant Robots! And who can resist something that pulpy, to say nothing of something this gorgeous?<br /><br />To round off the festitivites, you get the shadowy evil operative Lai Bing (who fights as stylishly as she dresses), dinosaurs, death ray beams, and the Hindenburg docking on the Empire State Builiding (a scene that is almost painfully beautiful) and even huge guardian Robots with cyclopean attack lasers and wavy tentacles, and fiendish plots to kidnap scientists, and...<br /><br />Well, you get the idea. It's like being 9 years old all over again.<br /><br />JSGgorgeous?  <br /> <br />To round off the festitivites, you get the shadowy evil operative Lai Bing (who fights as stylishly as she dresses), dinosaurs, death ray beams, and the Hindenburg docking on the Empire State Builiding (a scene that is almost painfully beautiful) and even huge guardian Robots with cyclopean attack lasers and wavy tentacles, and fiendish plots to kidnap scientists, and...  <br /> <br />Well, you get the idea.

B0007VZ9DK|1.0|I too have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc, I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic. And this is not even getting into the music copyright problems with 'Quantum Leap', which I quit buying cos of the double sided disc. Universal suck. I hope they are reading this.  BTW, the movie itself is 5 stars.  Universal get 0 stars for their products. more info at video business dot com.  note: On 1-17-06 a 1 disc/1 sided version was released.  Check it out and forget this double layer version.
B0000029GA|5.0|I'll just start off by saying I used to never listen to old skool rap, then I decided to pick up all the classic albums. After listening to Illmatic a few times, I realized why it is considered one of the best rap albums ever. I think I listen to it more than other other CD I own, because I can just listen to Nas's flow over and over again and never get tired of it. <br /> <br />Nas's lyrics are deep and simply a joy to listen to. It's crazy to think he was only 20 when he recorded it. He and Mobb Deep may have proved that rappers are the best at a young age. However, I think the thing I like the most about his album, is how his lyrics flow together so well. His multiple rhyming bars and his abilitly to flow from one line to the next is just remarkable. The only rappers I think I could put in his league are Biggie and Rakim. I think it's evident that rappers' first albums are always the best because of the time they dedicate to try to make it big. Illmatic and Ready to Die prove that. <br /> <br />The beats on the album are actually pretty good compared to other beats recorded around the same time. There are no songs where I could just listen to the beat by themselves, but they all work well with Nas rapping over them. The biggest problem by far with the album, in my opinion, has to be the hooks. They all pretty much suck, but it just lets you focus more on the verses, which are unmatched.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Korn's rebirth after the loss of their guitarist Head is a great new start. There will always be the loyal fans, but with each new CD, they bring in a new generation of Korn fans. This one will be no different. Unlike many of the reviewers on Amazon I have actually bought and listened to the album, while many times they review poorly to show their hatred of the band. It shows when they are unable to produce a sentence saying why they don't like the album, but instead say \\"thiz ban d suks it iz teh crapp!\\"    Old fans of Korn will really love Hypocrites and Liar, which the sound seems to stem more from their older albums. The best tracks on the album come in the middle, Throw Me Away, Love Song, and Open Up. New fans of Korn will enjoy Twisted Transistor, Politics, and Souvenir of Sadness. The entire album is strong and solid with the only flaws being 10 or a 2-way and Coming Undone. Some of the b-sides were much better than those two songs. Tearjerker is a great song but I would have preferred then ending the album with I've Seen it all, which would have made a much better closing song.    This is a great addition to anyone's music library. I also must admit, this is probably the best Korn album behind issues. Keep up the good work Korn. \m/
B000002P6R|2.0|Despite having been a huge Who and Townshend fan for more than twenty years, I have never been able to listen to my LP copy of this album all the way through in one sitting. I finally bought a copy on CD for completion sake and gave it a whole listen. While it is better than I remembered, it is still a pretty mediocre affair.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the Scoop version of Don't Le go the Coat led to a new appreciation of this song. However, I prefer the Scoop version of that and You Better You Bet. Another Tricky Day is pretty good and Daily Records is an OK example of the kind of songwriting Pete was doing at this point (compare to Guitar and Pen on Who are You). I will be happy to never hear Cache Cache or How Can You Do It Alone again, however.  <br /> <br />Finally, a correction to the review by Glenn Wall: John Entwistle, not Pete,  wrote Success Story from Who By Numbers. Still a great song.
B000C1YL1G|5.0|Alright. Something I will never understnad is why people who hate Eminem must insist on writing negative reviews as if they are going to convince fans. Look, just because you rate an album one or two stars, doesn't mean that you are magically going to change someone's opinion about music. The whole point of reviewing is to provide someone else who has similar interests to see if the CD is worthwhile. That being said, I'm sure that anyone browsing this CD already owns some of Eminem's previous CDs or has heard his songs on the radio. This is a greatest hits package, so every song that was on the radio or talked about in the media is on here. New songs are included as well, like \\"When I'm Gone\\", which is a great song. If you are a casual fan and dont want to buy every album and end up with a lot of filler, this is a good buy. Sure it's not ground-breaking hip-hop or even really \\"music\\", but its fun and different. Thank You...
068987474X|5.0|I had just gotten out of a bad marriage and an even worse first relationship after my marriage.  I thought for sure everything the men (I use this term loosely) in my life were telling me was just their way of saying they were really into me.  Well, guess what, not only were they not into me, but I was wasting my time on men that just weren't worth my time/weren't deserving of me or my time.  I read this book the first time and managed to rationalize why my situation was different.  Then, I waited about a month and re-read the book.  Guess what!  I finally got the message that I was \\"wasting the pretty\\" on men who weren't worth my time!  Don't read this book with the attitude that you can rationalize why you're different, read this book and take the message to heart.  The authors only want to see women happy in a relationship where they are truly valued.  Self-esteem doesn't grow on trees, but you should walk away from this book feeling like you have the power to kick the bad apples to the curb.
B00004R99U|4.0|Movies, in my view, are meant to be an escape-- and if they want to change historical details and still make a good story out of it, be my guest! I was disappointed at the ending of the first Pocahontas, but I understood the reasons. However, after watching the second one, I liked who she ended up with and I had more appreciation for the first movie.  Historical accuracy is for documentaries and the like-- \\"Amadeus\\" wasn't entirely historically accurate either, but it still maintains its status as a good movie!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is simply off the scale and beyond rating. You can't quantify it with stars, maybe with diamonds or the formation of galaxies or the birth, or rebirth, of planets. Better than we had any reason to expect. If I had attended these London shows I would have walked out of the hall, sat in the park across the street, looked to the sky and said God, take me now because I know nothing will ever top this experience. <br /> <br />A Cream fan of a certain age will understand me when I say that I waited my entire adult life for this. There was never a trio of such totally distinctive talents who came together in such equal balance to create such an entirely unique sound. If Cream ever meant anything to you, this DVD will reach very deep inside of your soul and your memories, as this event quite obviously did to the band. <br /> <br />There has never been a drummer quite like Ginger Baker (who actually looks younger and healthier than he did 37 years ago.) There has never been a bass player like Jack Bruce, here in top form in every way. As to Mr. Clapton, who in the past three decades, almost four, has never came close to touching his Cream work, all one can say is that his playing is simply staggering on these numbers, especially on the two performances of \\"We're Going Wrong\\" where he goes places I've never heard a musician go.  <br /> <br />Jaw dropping, joyous, and pretty much beyond words.
B000301YY8|2.0|James Blunt intrigued me after a performance on Saturday Night Live. His distinctive voice - which many consider a drawback - was actually the thing that drew me in. That, and the somewhat raw acoustic sound of his live performance. I found it hard to classify him based on the show, so I decided to buy Back to Bedlam.  <br /> <br />Many reviews of this CD are overwhelmingly positive, yet there are few clues about the reviewers themselves. They compare Blunt to Elton John, Bob Dylan, even the Beatles - lofty ideals to be sure (and WAY off-track in my opinion). But I wondered where the obvious comparison to Nick Drake was - Blunt's incomparable predecessor in the British, guitar-playing, heartfelt, tragic troubadour department. Even his album cover harkens back to Drake's persona. His absence in this group of references made me a little suspicious. As soon as I purchased the CD, I understood why. <br /> <br />Back to Bedlam is total teenybopper pop and not an inkling more. I realize this type of pop has its place, but I was expecting something more and was really disappointed. The reviews here speak of deep philosophical thought, brilliant songwriting, stellar production. I found the opposite to be true. While Blunt may certainly evolve in the future, to me his songwriting is immature and lacks any kind of complexity. The lyrics and rhymes are obvious and simplistic, the melodies and structures totally predictable.  <br /> <br /> I might have swooned over Blunt 25 years ago. It's perfect for teenaged girls. If you are one, or have one, I'd buy it. But if you are a discerning and experienced music fan, I'd steer clear. You can find real innovative songwriting, incredible arranging and production and lots of raw talent in artists of this genre such as Sufjan Stevens (Illinois), Elliot Smith, Franz Ferdinand and countless others. As well as, of course, the original - Nick Drake.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Why doesn't \\"Hats\\" get more recognition?  This should be right up there with some of the greatest releases of all time.  The music goes deep down into your soul.  The first time I listened to it I was completely mesmerized.  This release should receive more accolades than it's getting.
B000002GQH|5.0|Threshold is unquestionably one of the greatest albums of all time. Back in the UK in 1969, if you wore an RAF greatcoat and carried Threshold or a Led Zep album under your arm, you were most definitely considered 'hip'. <br /> <br />Everything about this superb album, from the haunting cover art to the incredible song selection screams out 'Classic!' This is one of those albums that really illustrates the collective genius that made the band so strong, with every member contributing some stunning material.  <br /> <br />I remember at the time that Lovely To See You and Dear Diary seemed to be playing everywhere you ever went; but they are just two of the many unforgettable songs that stamped the Moodies' authority on the progessive music scene. <br /> <br />The breathtaking Never Comes The Day (which is also covered on Moody Bluegrass) is another Hayward classic and a foretaste of the endless genius to come in masterpieces such as New Horizons, from Seventh Sojourn. <br /> <br />That this incredible album should close with one of Mike's most majestic epic pieces is just the icing on the cake. <br /> <br />What a band.
B0004Z33EG|4.0|I already own the Special Edition Trilogy but also bought this Ultimate Edition of First Blood for one major reason - the original ending (Deleted Scenes).  This time, in contrast to his negative experience with F.I.S.T. (1978, see my review of the DVD on Amazon.com), Stallone's concept of heroic anti-heroes and appropriate film endings fully won the day with his portrayal of Vietnam veteran Rambo, who came to live in David Morrell's debut novel First Blood published in 1972 (which inspired the original ending).  Later on, Stallone would transform other 1970s anti-heroes into more sympathetic, triumphant men: writer-director Stallone turned disco maniac Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever (1977) into a Broadway star with Rambo physique in the Rocky-esque sequel Staying Alive (1983).  The tale of two endings experienced a dj vu when the remake of the original Get Carter (1971) was released in 2000, with Stallone taking over the title role of Michael Caine's 1970s anti-hero.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the science fiction book for people who doesn't like science fiction.

B000000W5L|5.0|This was the last of the really great classic Stones albums from 1968-72 (Beggar's Banq, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Exile).  Some Girls and Tattoo You are good, but not on this level.  Exile shows the Stones at their real roots - country blues, gospel, ripping R&R. I think of Exile as the Stones' White Album - a great double album that would be even better without a few tracks included (Turd on the Run, Casino Boogie, Shake Your Hips).  All Down The Line is the greatest driving rock n roll song of all time.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|This cd is amazing. It is a totaly different sound from korn. DOnt get me wrong though it is still heavy.See You on the Other Side  Has some great lyrics and is a great album. It takes a while to get used to the new style but it is bad as hell. THe drums are a major part in this cd it is great. If you are a korn fan are just getting in to them this is a must have. the melodies are great and the music is alot darker then others dont pick this cd up expecting the self titled album. It is like the self titled and issues mixed it a great album.

This powerful novel vividly portrays a universal crisis of humankind, a crisis that remains as destructive today as when Steinbeck undertook to illuminate it for all those who dared to read.  Massive disparity of wealth in a society is far more than an economic conundrum. It has the power to destroy self-images, families, and lives.  It has the power to confuse honest laborers, to rouse them to helpless anger, and finally to sink them into abyssal despair.<br /><br />Industrialization drives sharecropper families from the land that they have tilled, harvested, bled upon, dropped sweat into, and been buried in for generations. Severed from the anchor they have always known, the families become wanderers, searching for a way and a place to survive.  They become the \\"have nots\\" of American society, feared and shunned by the \\"haves.\\"  Soulless land companies, banks, and agricultural industries are great, faceless controlling forces that exploit the landless and then drive them elsewhere.  How do ignorant sharecroppers fight such exploitation?  Mortals might as well take up arms against a malevolent deity.  The totality of despair created by such an economic system can hardly be imagined by one who has not experienced it.<br /><br />Is there no way out?  Steinbeck suggests that there is perhaps one hope.  If the migrant poor will only stick together, cooperate and support one another in solidarity, create a union of workers, then the impersonal corporate giants must listen. If two hundred men speak as one, the voice becomes loud enough to demand fair and humane treatment.  Easier said than done, especially when those who would speak of this aloud are jailed, beaten, and murdered by the giants' \\"hired guns.\\"<br /><br />This discussion suggests the essential difference between GRAPES OF WRATH and Steinbeck's other novels. The others paint struggles of mankind against the background of an amoral universe in which irony often distorts the outcome.  This one paints struggles of the \\"common man\\" against profit-and-loss ledgers of the agricultural industry.  It is brutal in its portrayal of how the \\"system\\" methodically destroys families, and it is equally brutal in its portrayal of the fear engendered in economically comfortable men by the influx of those who are in need. In the inevitable confrontation that follows, the veneer of civilization is replaced by stereotyping, then by hatred of the stereotype, and finally by repression of Americans by Americans.<br /><br />Yet, Steinbeck allows us to hope.  After Casy, the canny former preacher who finds courage to lead a strike against inhumane treatment of workers, lies in the mud with his skull crushed, Tom Joad leaves his crumbling family, vowing to follow Casy's vision.  Casy and Tom are our \\"Joe Hills\\":<br /><br />\\"The copper bosses killed you, Joe;<br /><br />They shot you, Joe\\" says I.<br /><br />\\"Takes more than guns to kill a man,\\"<br /><br />Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"<br /><br />Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"<br /><br />And standing there as big as life<br /><br />And smiling with his eyes,<br /><br />Says Joe, \\"What they can never kill<br /><br />went on to organize,<br /><br />went on to organize.\\"<br /><br />From San Diego up to Maine,<br /><br />in every mine and mill,<br /><br />where workingmen defend their rights,<br /><br />It's there you'll find Joe Hill,<br /><br />It's there you'll find Joe Hill!<br /><br />Now, who should read GRAPES OF WRATH?

B00068NVI4|4.0|There some excellent performances on this dvd and the atomsphere of it is is very positve. I think the best performance on the dvd is rythem of love...others are going for the one, show me, bluesy version of roundabout, awaken although all are good to very good. I suppose Starship Trooper could have been better but it's still ok. Mind Drive is another high light but it is split into two different parts the second half played after south side of the sky...it is an outstanding performance of it but I don't know why it is split up because the ritual isn't split up despite it's length.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns N' Roses' two 1991 Use Your Illusion albums have somewhat of a bad reputation for a number of reasons. First, the idea of releasing two separate albums simultaneously seemed dubious to many. The two albums were both 70 minutes long and loaded with several \\"epic\\" ballads that stretched out to nearly ten minutes. This gave the records a rather pompous, overly ambitious feel to some. Second, by 1991, a new wave of \\"alternative\\" rock bands were becoming popular such as Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Soundgarden. Therefore a lot of people felt that Guns N' Roses was too linked to the 1980s to still be relevant, and that they needed to step aside and make way for \\"grunge\\". Third, Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, as previously mentioned are both 70-minute albums and a lot of people feel that they are laden with filler. A lot of people say that if the band had trimmed some of the filler and released only one album, they would have had another masterpiece on their hands.     Over a decade later, it's a bit easier to look at this record and its counterpart with more objectivity. Personally, I only partially agree with the above assertions. I have no problem with the epic songs. Guns N' Roses understandably did not want to simply follow-up their classic debut, Appetite for Destruction, with a record that sounded exactly the same. They, or Axl Rose at least, wanted to change directions a bit and evolve musically. As far as any complaints about ballads, well the band's biggest hit was a ballad - Sweet Child O' Mine. That song proved that GNR was perfectly capable of recording a sincere ballad while still rocking like mad. While Use Your Illusion does have its share of ballads, there are many excellent hard rockers as well. As for the band being inexorably linked to the 1980s, that's merely a matter of timing, and not any fault of theirs. Guns N' Roses came along in the midst of \\"hair metal\\" and taught all those drag queens what real rock and roll was like. They were one of the few late '80s bands to be rooted in classic rock. With influences such as Aerosmith, The Stooges, AC/DC, Judas Priest, MC5, Nazareth and the Sex Pistols, Guns N' Roses brought '70s hard rock into the '80s.     As far as the albums containing filler, I would say that's true of Use Your Illusion II. However, Use Your Illusion I consists almost entirely of excellent, first-rate material. It is the better of the two albums, and while it is a bit long, it is an excellent rock album that should not be overlooked. The album kicks off with Right Next Door to Hell, a rapid-fire rocker that rocks harder than anything on Appetite for Destruction. Perfect Crime is another great hard rocker that would have fit in perfectly on Appetite. Don't Cry is a great ballad in the vein of Sweet Child O' Mine and one of the album's biggest hits. Bad Obsession is one of my favorite songs on the album. It's one of the bluesiest songs that GNR has ever recorded. It has a definite Rolling Stones/Aerosmith type feel complete with harmonica and a slide-guitar solo. Double Talkin' Jive is a fast hard rocker from Duff McKagan that really cooks. November Rain is a true GNR classic. One of their biggest hits and finest compositions. In true power ballad, it starts out slow and somber then builds to an awesome climax with stunning guitar solo by Slash. The Garden is a fine mid-tempo rocker featuring guest vocals by Alice Cooper. Don't Damn Me is another favorite of mine. Great guitar riff and honest lyrics from Axl. Coma ends the album on a high note. It's a very long song, but it's riveting and one of the album's best.     Use Your Illusion I is an excellent rock album that anyone who loves Guns N' Roses should not be without. Guns N' Roses was much more than just Appetite for Destruction. You're denying yourself some excellent music if you ignore this CD and Use Your Illusion II. It's truly a tour-de-force that the band put their hearts and souls into. Axl's lyrics and vocals are potent and hard-hitting as always, rhythm guitar from Izzy Stradlin and Slash is thick and meaty as always, and Slash's guitar solos are simply stunning. This album is almost worth listening to just for Slash's guitar playing. Just amazing. If you consider yourself any kind of Guns N' Roses fan, do not overlook this album. It is a masterpiece of modern hard rock.
0743487478|2.0|My wife loved this.  She found it inspiring.   I hated it, I found it profoundly unhelpful.   <br /> <br />It is typical of most parenting literature in that 1) it tells you that you are doing it wrong.  and 2) there is no 2. <br /> <br />The author is all negative.  Don't focus on getting good behavior through rewareds or punishment just use love and understanding.  Ok, what should I do when, say the toddler stomps on the cat just to see what happens?   <br /> <br />STOMP!! MEOOWER!  \\"OK, honey baby, that makes the cat sad, so please don't do it.\\"   <br />STOMP!! MEOOWER!  \\"Hey kiddie widdlie, when you kick the cat upside the head, it hurts her, and she doesn't like that, so she would prefer it if you stopped that.\\"  <br />STOMP!! MEOOWER!  OK, screw Alfie. Back to reality, kid.  You are getting a time out! <br /> <br />He has nothing to say about real world parenting challenges, spending the entire book burning straw men.   He would rather criticize the (no doubt fictional) parent who supposedly chastised their child for enjoying a day at the park, than tell real parents how to cope with real challenges.

B000286S8S|5.0|You know, the brief Sammy-back-in-VH happened on 2004 left to all around the world and specially we the VH fans this huge legacy of the purest rock 'n roll ever tasted by anyone. Containg 3 major new songs that prove the chemistry-of-anger between Sam and Ed, BOBW focused on the 2 great eras of the band: DLR + RR. To me it's a great idea they did switchin' each track from both. You can compare, and realize that there are not 2 sides: it's just Van Halen!!!! Only complaint a little thing: the last 3 tracks (live versions by Sam of the first era) are quite good, but they'd tried puttin' 3 songs a lot of us think they shouldn't left over: mean street, humans being, summer nights (or, in case, romeo delight - great one). <br /> <br />So c'mon, put 'em both together, shake with a little piece of favorite whiskey, tequila or just can a beer, an enjoy! <br />

Being unimpressed with this CLASSIC is similar to saying you are not impressed with Shakespeare...it says much more about you than Shakespeare.

0060899190|5.0|This book is amazing.  I ordered it as soon as I knew that it was being published.  Even though I had seen most of the postcards reading them again re-evoked that initial emotion, and sometimes even more than that.<br /><br />The lay-out as most people say, is a little annoying, and mostly aggravating.  But as many of those persons also say, \\"Frank Warren made this book for an easy buck?\\", I think that they are completely wrong.<br /><br />Frank Warren puts, on the PostSecret website, that awareness of depression and suicide should be more prominent in our culture.  Isn't it a safe assumption to say that he also would give a fair portion to one of the many foundations he supports on his website.  I think that Frank has done an amazing job, and for those who don't like the book, must not have compassion, or any secrets of their own.<br /><br />Anyone with a secret can appreciate the courage it took for some of these secrets to come out.  I know I do.
0312117337|5.0|I found the Osho-Zen Tarot Deck five years ago and it is the deck with which I exclusively read. The knowledge of \\"traditional\\" Tarot prior to the exclusive use of this deck, allows me to give my clients a multi-dimensional read. Even the most challenging cards bring the issue back to light and awareness - the place where we have power. The illustrations of the deck are as beautiful as the meanings of the various cards.    I bought this deck of cards in a little Las Vegas bookstore after my entire body went gooseflesh when I turned to a specific card. TRUST shows a fearless girl in a swan-dive leap into a blue and pink sky. It's as if she knows she'll be caught by all the kindness and goodness in the world. Her little white dress is caught up in the wind of her leap and her dark hair streams behind. She holds onto nothing but her faith in the NOW.    Mona Joseph a.k.a.

0316168815|1.0|I think it is a well written novel technically... Well the first half that I managed to read. Maybe it's just my own personal taste, but the book is slow and pretty uneventful. A really great angle for the story by having a narative from a dead girl -- but that (for me) sems to be the only thing it has going for it. To this end I ended up reading it in pieces so it felt even slower. I think if you like a very good sensitive, well written but ultimately slow book - then it will appeal. If you want something with more bang then go check out Da Vinci code, Angels & Demons, Vanish, Secret Revelation, or State of Fear. I read all of these between reading Lovely Bones -- sorry.
B000025JU0|5.0|A very different perspective than the reviews I've read here is that  [[ASIN:B000LXXAU8 Junk Culture]] is OMD's peak!  This release very successfully blends the 'art' with the 'pop'.  The previous release, [[ASIN:B0013E4D9G Dazzle Ships]], doesn't have hooks to demand the listener play the album over and over, while the next release, [[ASIN:B00000EAMG Crush]], is contaminated by the peppering  of crassly calculated careerist &#34;hit singles&#34; (soulless Stephen Hague produced and banished all quirk factor, except Andy McCluskey's distinctive(!) voice) that unapologetically commenced OMD's short wade into mainstream impotency.  In my mind, [[ASIN:B00000EAMB Junk Culture]] is their final chapter, with a few of the more interesting tracks from [[ASIN:B000025JU1 Crush]] as an addendum. DISCLAIMER OF ADOLESCENT SUBJECTIVITY: this lp took over my turntable in 1985 when I was developmentally in &#34;teenage sponge mode&#34;.  Still, objectively speaking, it is the culmination of their intelligent quirky art-pop aesthetic.  Beautiful arranging/production, and Peter Saville design, too!
B000002I25|5.0|Truly, any sub-5 star review should be sticken.  Regardless of whether or not you like the Doors, the album is a gem and is truly timeless.  Forget compilations - they're a terrible representation of an artists work.  First and foremost, you need to have The Doors' first album.  From this they expand and unleash a variety of other blues powered, beatnick-inspiried lyrical masterpieces. Break on Through and Light My Fire...Need I say more?
B00008BXJJ|5.0|THE BAND: Angus Young (lead guitar & private school-boy attire), Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Brian Johnson (vocals), Cliff Williams (bass), Chris Slade (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2003) Digitally remastered. This tri-fold \\"Collector's Edition\\" contains 2 discs - 23 total songs, approx 71 minutes on disc 1, and approx 62 minutes on disc 2. There is a single disc version available as well featuring only 14 of the same songs here (the bigger hits perhaps?)... but I recommend the 2 disc set due to the songs that you'd be missing (namely \\"Sin City\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"High Voltage\\", \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\"). Recorded during the 'Razor's Edge World Tour' in 1990-91 (153 concerts in 21 different countries). The disc also contains a 14-page booklet, with some history, song listing, and band pictures. Label - Sony.<br /><br />COMMENTS: It's been a long 14 years since AC/DC has put out a live album (\\"If You Want Blood You've Got It\\" in 1978)... in my mind, too long. So much of AC/DC's music is in your face rock and roll. It's pure, raw, bluesy, and best played loud. They're great on stage, they work the crowd, and if you've ever been to one of their concerts you know what I mean. The rhaspy bravado of screamer Brian Johnson really goes a long way. At first glance in the store, I though this might be their 'Monsters Of Rock' concert from Donnington (of the same year) - but it's not. The 23 songs here are taken from all over the globe. Disc 1 features some great tunes with highlights being the opener \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"Heatseeker\\", \\"The Jack\\" and the 14+ minute \\"Jailbreak\\". Disc 2 has more classic material with the highlights being the 10+ minute \\"High Voltage\\", the 12+ minute \\"Let There Be Rock\\", or the closer \\"For Those About To Rock\\" with the cannons blasting. AC/DC had a resurrected career and tour with the success of \\"The Razor's Edge\\" album (featuring the mega hits \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Moneytalks\\"), and this LIVE album captures it. Awesome song list. Great sound. Nicely packaged. Great disc(s).it. Awesome song list. Great sound. Nicely packaged. Great disc(s).
0553573403|5.0|When browsing the racks I have never, ever, voluntarily picked up any book that (judging by it's cover, *sigh*) smacks of pelt-wearing, sword fighting, pseudo-Renaissance-festivally antics.<br /><br />However, a friend recommended it to me whose judgement has been proven reliable, so I looked at the read-it-now pages on Amazon.  I was apparently in the right frame of mind to be receptive or maybe was just bored at work, but, I ordered it.<br /><br />After reading the first (A Game of Thrones) I couldn't WAIT to get delivery of the second, and after that one, I was amped to get the third.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones and the next two volumes are great stories, and told entirely without the sentimental, overwrought clap trap one can encounter in other titles in the genre.  In fact Martin doesn't spare any character from any outcome, no matter how beloved or seemingly intrinsic to the plot.<br /><br />If you need some escapist fiction, and are okay with encountering violence -- such as someone getting run through with a sword -- every chapter or two, then this is a great book to pick up.
0062502182|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Paulo Coelho - but it definitely won't be my last!  In \\"The Alchemist\\", Paulo demonstrates his wonderful ability to \\"sew\\" spiritual truths into a page-turning story - enabling the reader to learn important lessons while being entertained at the same time.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is about a shepherd boy who, after a series of dreams, is led to go searching for his \\"personal legend\\", or \\"right path\\".  During this journey, the boy meets many interesting people - each with something to teach him.<br /><br />Over time, the boy learns that there is a \\"universal language\\" -one that is understood not only by all people, but by all things.  He also learns about the importance of seeking your \\"personal legend\\", and how omens can be used to help everyone in this endeavor.  And love, he learns about the importance of love, and much, much more...<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"The Alchemist\\" to be an interesting, important book.  It serves to remind us of many spiritual truths that tend to get lost in the shuffle of our everyday lives.  As such, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality - it's definitely a worthwhile read!
B0009S3HI0|3.0|As for the covers, well, I was a huge fan prior to \\"Deftones\\" so I had heard them all before.  I'll be honest, I hated the direction the Deftones took with \\"Deftones.\\"  So \\"Sinatra\\" is one particular track I could have lived without.  Would I pay full price for all of them?  Not so much.  Buy used if possible, is my advice.  The videos are alright.  Worth the full $23 though?  Again, no.  Granted, this was all much higher quality than any other Deftones media I had prior to \\"B-Sides...\\" release, but I didn't feel anything stood out that much to make this a worthwhile album, DVD or not. <br />Definitely not a good purchase for a casual listener.  Want some Deftones?  Adrenaline, Around the Fur, and White Pony are all amazing.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Why is it that folks can't seem to understand that musicians - particularly those blessed with amazing talents - want to expand and break out of the molds they're cast into? I've read all these Amazon comments about Beck going techno with this album, and after listening to it more than a few times, it seems like this is the kind of record that Jimi Hendrix would be happy to make if he were still alive. Jeff Beck is consistently out on the bleeding edge, making new music and coaxing wild new sounds from his guitar, and I hope he continues to push the boundaries for many years to come.
B000BW8B6C|5.0|I bought this because i'm an avid collector of all things Korn.  It's the same thing, except their is no swearing obviously.

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Coming off a mediocre \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" and the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, KoRn have gone back to the drawing board. I had high hopes for this album even though their past two albums have been sub-par, I guess it was because of all the hype. KoRn promised a different sound and also a different kind of heavy, and they have delievered in every way. This is without question KoRn's most experimental album to date, even more experimental than \\"Untouchables.\\" Some of the songs are even more atmospheric with the industrial touches such as \\"Throw Me Away\\" and \\"Tearjerker.\\" Some are just downright heavy and sound amazing such as \\"Hypocrites\\" and \\"Liar.\\" It's kind of tiring to see reviews that bash a KoRn album if they try something new because they \\"depart from their roots\\" and then bash them again when they try to stay true to their roots because they don't evolve or expand. \\"Other Side\\" will also get a lot of mixed reviews because this is a whole new direction in sound for KoRn, but to me it's a very good one, this album should have followed up \\"Untouchables.\\" I find this release to be their best since \\"Follow the Leader\\" not to mention also they're most creative. To all of the \\"old school\\" fans, either quit living in the past or move on, everyone is tired of hearing you bash KoRn because they don't sound like they did in 1994. KoRn tried to be like that with \\"Take A Look...\\" but John's voice has evolved and just doesn't pack that anger punch like it used to. I'm glad to see he's working on his voice to hit those high notes and pitches, he doesn't have the best voice in the world but it fits KoRn very well. Also, the songs we're mixed and co-written by Matrix and Ross and they are easily distinguishable in who mixed which song. All of the guitar and drum driven tracks are produced by the Matrix, and all the industrial driven tracks are produced by Ross. I prefer the Matrix over Ross myself but that doesn't make Ross's tracks bad. All in all a very solid release from KoRn that should keep the long time fans happy and maybe pull in some new ones. Highly Recommended.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Far more pop oriented than anything else Josh Homme has been involved in.  I'd like to mention that this really isn't his side project; it's the project of a friend of his and he was invited as the band's drummer.  Overall, worth a listen and may well strike a chord with you.  I will admit, though, that lyrics like \\"Miss Alissa..Gonna do a voodoo dance...Can you feel my power now?\\" are a tad hokey...  But you'll start to feel that, if anything, Peace Love Death Metal is too short in the sense that you'd like some more to listen to.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This is the worst CD ,not only from Korn, but from any CD that I've listened to lately. There sounds like there was no effort put into this whatsoever. I would actually say the best way to describe this CD is freakin boring as he11!!! While Head is down in the Dark COntinent trying to help som crazy cannibal folk, the rest of the band is up here wasting out time and money. Thanks fo nothing. Flush this Korny log right down the toilet.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I am a huge Korn fan, and I admit this album is definately not for everybody. I greatly recommend that you preview it with a friend or something before buying. Not every Korn fan will enjoy this new experiment. It's hard to even describe. I wouldn't completely ignore it, however. It is still very interesting and has some very awesome points. Once again, I suggest you check it out before you buy.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Coming off a mediocre \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" and the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, KoRn have gone back to the drawing board.  I had high hopes for this album even though their past two albums have been sub-par, I guess it was because of all the hype.  KoRn promised a different sound and also a different kind of heavy, and they have delievered in every way.  This is without question KoRn's most experimental album to date, even more experimental than \\"Untouchables.\\"  Some of the songs are even more atmospheric with the industrial touches such as \\"Throw Me Away\\" and \\"Tearjerker.\\"  Some are just downright heavy and sound amazing such as \\"Hypocrites\\" and \\"Liar.\\"  It's kind of tiring to see reviews that bash a KoRn album if they try something new because they \\"depart from their roots\\" and then bash them again when they try to stay true to their roots because they don't evolve or expand.  \\"Other Side\\" will also get a lot of mixed reviews because this is a whole new direction in sound for KoRn, but to me it's a very good one, this album should have followed up \\"Untouchables.\\"  I find this release to be their best since \\"Follow the Leader\\" not to mention also they're most creative.  To all of the \\"old school\\" fans, either quit living in the past or move on, everyone is tired of hearing you bash KoRn because they don't sound like they did in 1994.  KoRn tried to be like that with \\"Take A Look...\\" but John's voice has evolved and just doesn't pack that anger punch like it used to.  I'm glad to see he's working on his voice to hit those high notes and pitches, he doesn't have the best voice in the world but it fits KoRn very well.  Also, the songs we're mixed and co-written by Matrix and Ross and they are easily distinguishable in who mixed which song.  All of the guitar and drum driven tracks are produced by the Matrix, and all the industrial driven tracks are produced by Ross.  I prefer the Matrix over Ross myself but that doesn't make Ross's tracks bad.  All in all avery solid release from KoRn that should keep the long time fans happy and maybe pull in some new ones.  Highly Recommended.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album really has everything...Slow and moody, (fairly) fast and furious...  What really strikes me most is the the beautiful flow in the entire album.  Not one track seems out of place.  This is really an necessary purchase in order to appreciate modern rock.  It does depart some from its Opiate and Undertow roots, but I guarantee, it's all excellent stuff.
0767817478|4.0|I like this movie. No, this is not Godzilla, but it is a good kaiju (means giant monster in Japanese) movie. It is later explained in the movie \\"Godzilla Mothra King Ghidorah Giant Monsters All Out Attack\\", that came out after this movie, that it was not Godzilla that attacked New York, it was another monster and the Americans had mistaken it for Godzilla, not knowing any better. So if you watch the movie in that light, this is a good movie. The computer effects are incredible; the story is very well done as well. This \\"Godzilla\\", a.k.a G.I.N.O.(Godzilla In Name Only) to us Godzilla fans looked real and was very intelligent. GINO is smart, he out smarted the choppers chasing him twice. I think it is underrated for no good reason, this is NOT GODZILLA, like I said, it is explained in a later Godzilla movie that it wasn't. So now that you know it's not really Godzilla, enjoy this movie, because this is a new monster, and there are a lot more movies that are worse
B0006399FS|3.0|I wanted to love this disc, I really did. I like the U2 as much as the next guy, am quite familiar with their catalog, and thought ATYCLB was a great disc.  <br /> <br />This one, though, just doesn't have the oomph, the staying power. A year, or whatever it's been, down the line, it doesn't beckon to you to be played.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, I can't completely diss it either: it does have a handful of excellent tracks, like \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", \\"Vertigo\\" (someone give that guy a Spanish lesson, pronto), and my personal fave of the set, \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", the kind of haunting, gorgeous, big-chorus anthem Bono and co. excel at....
0060899190|5.0|Although the layout to this book does lack in some areas, the impact of this book is still effective.   <br /> <br />Some of what you will see will want to make you laugh; others will make you cringe while still others may make you sick.   <br /> <br />These anonymous people have allowed the reader to take a peek inside their psyche and see their weaknesses.  It hurts to see someone else's hurt, but many times it is the only way to understand.   <br /> <br />I hope that everyone that encounters Post Secret can come to understand the significance that this can make on our culture.  This is humanity.  This is you, and it is me.
B000B0WODA|2.0|The album has one great song and thats \\"Do you want to.\\" Now don't mistake me this album has some more good songs but only one great song. If your like me then your better off downloading the single. Don't waste your money. Spend it on New Order \\"Singles\\".
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I was there when the three man band hit the airwaves. Hendrix, Cream and a host of others both big and insignificant. This album is huge! Brought me right back to the first time I ever heard a three man band. Mayer is gritty and fills in the sound with his whole chrord, note, trill thing he has going on. The interplay between him and Palladino will bring back memories of Clapton and Jack Bruce but it's not as combative, more of an understanding interplay. Mayer struggles a little with his innovation...trying too hard... but it will come. The album is as raw a sound as I've heard since I was a kid and how a 'kid' like Mayer, born so long after the fact, is able to capture so well the entire feel of the live cranked show is beyond me. Go Johnny go...
0307263118|5.0|John Banville puts his readers on notice within the first ten pages, with words such as `leporine' and `apotropaic,' that we are securely in the hands of a master of the English language.  And there's a safe, cozy feeling knowing that our guide on this literary journey is fully in command of his linguistic tool set.<br /><br />Go ahead, look `em up.  And you may want to keep that dictionary handy.<br /><br />Reading a book like this is a beautiful reminder of the difference between good and great fiction.  Great fiction is about more than just plot and characters and voice; it's about every single word being there for a reason.  It's the blending of both the art and the science of writing.  And it isn't achieved all that often.<br /><br />In The Sea, the story flows like a nostalgic, melancholy reverie, floating back and forth between past and present.  The writing is more poetry than prose.  I rarely put much stock in the blurbs and sound bites on a novel's cover, but in this case the Sunday Telegraph's reference to Banville as \\"the heir to Nabokov\\" is right on.  Like Nabokov, every word feels pregnant with meaning and power.  Every few moments there is a passage so exquisitely written that you find, at the end of it, that you have been holding your breath throughout.  Like this one:<br /><br />\\"In those endless October nights, lying side by side in the darkness, toppled statues of ourselves, we sought escape from an intolerable present in the only tense possible, the past, that is, the faraway past.  We went back over our earliest days together, reminding, correcting, helping each other, like two ancients tottering arm-in-arm along the ramparts of a town where they had once lived, long ago.\\"<br /><br />You may find yourself re-reading passages in order to savor the full effect, or reading out loud to yourself so that you might feel the sensuality of the language on your tongue.  This is a book that begs to be read slowly.<br /><br />In a book like this, plot seems secondary, almost unnecessary.  And yet there is also an exquisite story here, in fact two stories, a widower's struggle to escape the grief of his wife's passing, and a young boy's coming of age over the course of a summer.  Both stories unfold at the sea, in the same place in fact, though separated chronologically by fifty years.  And as the two stories gracefully intertwine, they bear witness to the powerful connection we all maintain to our past.<br /><br />Still have that dictionary handy?  Try `anabasis' and `aperçus' - those are from the last ten pages.  Man this guy is good.is, plot seems secondary, almost unnecessary.

B000BVD460|4.0|Overall this is a very good hits compilation. All of the major ones are here from the one that made him famous, My Name Is, to his new single When Im Gone.The other new tracks are my reasons for the 4 star rating. It would have gotten 5 stars if the 2 new tracks were lyrically good. But FACK is very immature and childish and Shake That is more of a Nate Dogg track then an Eminem one. Which isnt his fault at all. Over the years has touched on almost everything, and this shows a lack of good material to work with. <br /> <br />I also see people complaining about a lack of Bad Meets Evil or good freestyles. This is a GREATEST HITS  not a Best Of Eminem cd. Greatest Hits basically mean greatest singles. But still overall the man is a legend and this is a good cd for a new Eminem fan or a collecter of the hsi work like me. This could very well be his last cd since he has stated he'll be putting the mic down for a while.
0783226063|4.0|I have always loved this movie.I saw it when it first came out at the theaters.I had never read the books at that time,but was very impressed with the story ,look,and feel of the movie.<br /><br />Instead of plastic shiny technology,it was more organic looking.I loved the the direction.The way the characters passionatly portray themselves is wonderful.To me,the movie had no flaws...I also love the longer narrated version of this film,and am eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD.
0671027344|4.0|It was easy for me to relate to Charlie from the book The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. Chbosky creates an image of the protagonist Charlie as a lonely teenage boy on the verge of adulthood who is trying to find friends while entering high school. <br /> From the beginning of the book I had a love for Charlie and felt sorry for him because of the suicide of one of his friends and his confusion about understanding the death of his aunt Helen. He is unsocial and has to live up to the image of his brother, a starting football player at Penn State, and his sister who has one of the highest grades in her class. Charlie is a very smart and shy person who observes people from a distance, looking at people and analyzing them.  <br /> <br />I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs, or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way.  <br /> <br /> Sam and Patrick are the best friends that anyone could ask for. Charlie meets Patrick in shop class and starts to hang out with him and his step-sister Sam. They treat Charlie with so much respect and they are there to help him through anything. They assist Charlie dealing with the depression he has had after the death of his friend.  They remind me of the friends I have and it is easy to understand their relationship.  <br /> The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book that left a lasting impression in my mind.  The setting and conflicts in the story seem like they could have happened to me or any teenager. At some points in the story I was able to know exactly how Charlie felt because of the typical teenage issues that the book demonstrates.  <br /> The Perks of Being a Wallflower is for young adult readers and is set up as letters that Charlie wrote to an unknown friend telling about his life and everything that goes on in Charlie's mind. It is easy to understand and any teenager can relate this book to their life.  <br />
B000B5IPLK|3.0|Going live from your recorded material is always a tricky move and some artist can pull it off well (Erykah Badu) and some are just so-so. This is one of those so-so cases. The highlight is the Common/Mos Def/Marley collabo. Some of the songs ran too long in my opinion.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|i think johm mayer tried to make this move too early. He simply isnt ready. He shot for the stars and missed horribly.  <br />He should have played this kind of music for at least another few years to hone what potential he might have, because this seems very premature .

B00005ATQF|5.0|This movie first of all was directed by Stanely Kubrick, who in my opinion is the best director of all time.  This movie begins where other movies never begin... Training camp, in this case Parris Island.  The drill sergeant, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is by far the most \\"inspirational\\" speaker I've ever seen.  His wasy of demoralizing troops is unsurpassed.  Heres a small excercept from the movie. Seargent \\"Where are you from Private?\\"Private \\"Texas Sir!\\" Seargent \\"Holy dog**** only steers and queers come from Texas and you don't look too much like a steer so I guess that narrows it down a bit!\\" As you can see the language and themes used in this movie are so entertaining that you will probably fall out of your seat laughing.  The movie shows the horrors of war and such and Gustav Hasford a man who knows quite a bit about war reveals an unseen side of Vietnam.  Soldiers that enjoyed it, soldiers who called it great times and such.  I felt this movie deserved to be worshipped it was a masterpiece...
B0002X314C|3.0|Not a bad debut for the self-procalimed legend. I like his vibe though. Maybe from a 2nd installment I can see where this cat may be headed. \\"Ordinary People\\" is the staple in this whole thang while \\"Used To Love You\\" is the groove thang. I also liked \\"Live It Up\\", a very nice 70s-ish feel to it, almost sounds as if it could be a sitcom theme (And that's not a slight). A keeper though.
B000BVEKO0|3.0|I hate records like this, but it does take a few listenings to it to really get into it. I wouldn't really say the band is going in a \\"new direction\\" but they're just evolving, which is a good thing. I just wish the record was a tad heavier. I would've preferred if the bonus songs were on the CD to replace a couple of the clunkers, but what can you do? BestBuy had an exclusive download of \\"Appears\\" which I wish I had, but I bought mine at Target and got a download for a mediocre song that I can't remember the title of.<br />The absence of Head is evident on the record, IMO. I wish he would return and help KoRn make another ballsy record. It seems like the group is slowly becoming the Jonathan Davidson Project more than a band effort.<br />Best of the best: Twisted Transistor, Open Up, and Love Song.
630542845X|5.0|Many individuals feel like outcasts in this world--as if they're somehow \\"different\\" from the rest of humanity.<br /><br />The central character of this movie is defintely an outcast. Called \\"Powder\\" because of his snow-white skin, this teenager was kept in his grandparent's basement his entire life. He is brought into the school system where kids ridicule, abuse, misunderstand, and even fear him. His science teacher (played by Jeff Goldblum) and the schoolmaster (played by Mary Steenburgen) discover that Powder can control electricity--and has profound wisdom and empathetic insight.<br /><br />Powder is peaceful, tragic Christ-figure who is persecuted for being different and, perhaps, for being prophetic and \\"otherworldly\\" as well.<br /><br />The ending is powerful and satisfying, especially given the gut-wrenching treatment that Powder endures. Some fascinating mystical themes in this movie include the transformation from the physical into pure spirit, the evolution of man, the capacity of Spirit, the power of love, and the archetypal metaphor of feeling \\"not of this world.\\"
B000BJS4TO|4.0|And why is she writing about someone she knows nothing about? First of all you don't have to have an Asian composer to score an Asian-themed film. I love Dun and Hasaishi, but I'll digress from this gripe because it's so ridiculous. Second of all, Williams didn't \\"win\\" the assignment. When John Williams agress to score your film you don't saying anything other than \\"Thank you, Mr. Williams\\". No doubt it was Spielberg's early decision to direct the film that led John Williams to score it. When Spielberg decided to leave the directing and just produce, Williams respectably stayed on to score.  <br /> <br />The next ridiculous statement: \\"Left the bombast at home\\". Ok, so you're not familiar with the works of John Williams. That's OK. Just say so. You think because you've heard Star Wars and Jurassic Park that you know his music? You don't have to look very hard to realize that Williams is as affluent in crafting the most delicate musical textures as evident in this very John Willaims-esque score.  <br /> <br />John Williams is a master of his craft. And one of the few. Well into the twilight of his career he continues to redefine the art. \\"A.I.\\", \\"Minority Report\\", and espeically \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" all carved new niches in the film scoring tree. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" continues this tend. Somebody this far into their career should not be reinnovating the industry with each new score. But yet, Williams has been doing this with his last several years of work. \\"Memoirs\\" is poetically rich and inspiring. Crafted by somebody who clearly undestands the power of film and the art of storytelling. I want badly to let Williams go and let some of the younger composers take the mantle. But all of them are way far off from equalling this seasoned master. So it looks like Williams will continue his reign.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney Spears insipid and uninspired cover version of Bobby Browns seminal R'n'B anthem \\"My Perogative\\" amounts to musical high treason.  Browns original, a precursor to new jack swing, was a sexy, sassy funk number with a chugging bassline, captivating hook and addictive swagger.  Speers is tuneless, crass, over-produced, devoid of soul, unimaginative and characteristically hollow.   <br /> <br />Where Browns original captivated dancefloors with its groundbreaking blend of staunch hip hop beats and harmonious vocals (and indeed, still does to this day), Speers is a throw-a-way record company cash-in, designed to increase sales for an equally uninspiring Greatest Hits package. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the travesty that such an enduring and famous funk anthem has been desecrated will be lost on much of Speers fanbase, the majority of whom would not be old enough to remember Browns original version and therefore continue to believe in their baseless \\"superior cover version\\" nonsense.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Few movies can actually make me appreciate Shakespeare since they are usually very boring and dreary. This is such a beautiful movie with some wonderful actors such as young shakespeare, Fiennes. I dont see how anyone could watch this movie and not appreciate his brilliance.<br /><br />The movie focuses on a young actor (who is really a woman) played by Gwenth Paltrow who wants to be part of the Romeo and Juliet play put on by Shakespeare. Paltrow falls in love and reveals her true identity to him gradually but she is already courted and given away in marriage to a man destined to explore the New World. Shakespeare loves her and does not want her to leave so in true form writes a play about her dubbed the 12th night.<br /><br /> What I really loved about this movie was that its something that Shakespeare could have written himself. It has factored in all the customs, scenes, and beliefs of the time, and it plays out like a play with the thwarted lovers doomed never to see each other. I really enjoyed this movie.
B00007GZR5|4.0|What Dreams May Come is a beautiful and haunting metaphysical tale of life after death.<br /><br />Neurologist Chris (played by Robin Williams) and his artist wife Annie (played by Annabella Sciorra) had a fairy-tale life until they lost their children in an auto accident. No sooner do they begin to recover when Chris meets his own untimely death.<br /><br />Chris meets up with an angel named Albert (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) who gives him a tour of his afterlife. The images are stunning--with Chris cavorting through vibrantly colorful, impressionistic, oil-painted terrain.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Annie becomes depressed and takes her own life. Chris must then traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair. The mystical themes that I enjoyed in this movie are that of redemption, the power of love even beyond the grave, and life after death.

B000C1YL1G|4.0|This CD is really bad for anyone who says Eminem fell off after 'The Marshall Mathers LP'. Most of the songs on this CD are directed toward groupies. In my own opinion, I didn't buy this CD but by looking at the tracklist, I wouldn't enjoy this CD very much. <br /> <br />I wish the bonus disc would of included songs he personally liked instead of the short 'Stans Mixtape', although.. I do like the songs on the bonus disc, but it's too short. <br /> <br />This is alright for newer Eminem fans.

B00000K19E|5.0|Keanu Reeves plays Neo Anderson (a name which means \\"new man\\"). Is he living \\"for real\\"? Or is he caught up in a computer program that dictates his reality?<br /><br />He has a choice between the blue pill or the red pill: will Neo \\"wake up\\" to the truth despite the possibility that it will shatter reality as he knows it? Or will he choose to remain asleep and oblivious? This is an overtly New Age theme: will humanity evolve past illusion and conditioned responses?<br /><br />Other fascinating mystical themes include the nature of reality and truth, Biblical themes such as Messianic salvation, spiritual re-birth, and resurrection.<br /><br />Replete with major eye-candy and stunning fight scenes, this is a movie heavy on the symbolic--especially concerning the names.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah Carey, and the consequent re-releases of her new album, have ultimately emphasised the crumbling of the music industry, and the integrity of music itself. Whilst it may seem overly dramatic, the success of this re-release has only solidified the notion that the music-buying public is easily swayed and tricked into 'double-dipping', an affliction which has plagued the DVD market for sometime. Record executives now know that we are willing to part with our cash for some cheap modification of an already stale product. <br /> <br />Whilst Usher's recent re-release can also be blamed for much of the dismay, mariah has a larger portion of the burden, as she has decided to dip her fingers into the pie four times over (and a rumoured fifth dip coming late december)!!!  <br /> <br />Now, I don't want to post a mindless bashing of Mariah, as other reviewers have, but the greed which she has exuded this year is despicable. I would never have thought of her as an artist who would metaphorically rape her fans of their money, but all these mediocre releases smell of an artist who is desperate to have hang onto what could be a singular come-back. <br /> <br />The quicker mariah realises that what goes up must come down, the quicker she can move on to greater things, perhaps a new album.
B00005JMX6|5.0|The storyline would drive just about any guy to the movie-house. Young guy finds out his new next door neighbour is a porn-star. <br />Thr truth of the matter is that you actually get a lot more than you bargained for... in my case, the best TEEN COMEDY I've ever seen. <br />A great story, brilliant cast who all deliver magnificent and believable performances, loads of laughs and a very clever message that works it way to the top throughout the film. <br />The story follows a young guy working on a scholarship, the real deal - goody 2 shoes - always in class, wants to be President. His world is turned upside down by Elisha Cuthbert who moves in next door and teaches him there's more to life than books and work.  <br />The two ultimately fall in love and find balance in each other. She teaches him to loosen up, and he shows her that her life can start again after porn and she can find real love. <br />The BEST PERFORMANCE in the film is from TIMOTHY OLYPHANT, who delivers the best lines. He is scary! So over the top - brilliant. He rocks up to take his \\"star\\" back to the world she's trying to get away from. <br />Throw in some goofy friends... the scholarship dinner... the VEGAS ADULT FILM FESTIVAL... and SENIOR PROM...  <br />ALL THE INGREDIANTS FOR A GREAT FILM. <br />This one is not as below the belt and \\"crude\\" as most teen films. There is a fair share of flesh and \\"cringe button\\" scenes. But it's really a LOVE STORY!!! Do see. It's cleverly written and very nostalgic. <br /> <br />
B00003CXXP|4.0|This film was started by Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Oddysey) but finished by Stephen Spielberg (E.T., War of the Worlds).<br /><br />A modern Pinocchio-like story, Haley Joel Osment plays an artificial intelligence that is \\"programmed\\" to love the Mother who buys him and speaks a specific activation code. However, his adoptive family rejects him, leaving him yearning for love and looking for the \\"blue fairy\\" for his answers--and a reunion with his beloved Mother.<br /><br />Osment's character meets up with another A.I. named Gigolo Joe (brilliantly played Jude Law), as they navigate the city for answers.<br /><br />Kubrick's edgy and gritty fingerprints are on several sections of this movie such as the sadistic gladiator-like games. Some parts were heart wrenching to watch, and Osment's and Law's performances were amazing. John Williams' score was also exquisite. I was a little disappointed at the ending, but the mystical themes of \\"what defines life?\\", alien intelligence, yearnings of the heart, and the cruelty of humanity make this movie both thought and conversation provoking.<br /><br />Had Kubrick lived, I have a feeling the ending would have been much less hopeful (a signature of Spielberg films).
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album represents what rock and roll is all about at its core - a couple guys (guys and gals) plugging in thier instruments and making noise. The Stripes jump all over the genre map and play what they like and it seems that a lot of other people like it too. This will likely be one of the few momorable albums from this tepid period of music history.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new album is as perfect as an album can get. It is a superbly crafted sonic journey, from start to end, and when it's over, you'll want to go again. <br /> <br />Yes, all the positive reviews are spot on, and the critical acclaim is well deserved. Don't think, just click the 'add to cart' button, and give your senses an underground disco rush.
B000B5IPDI|4.0|I own the movie. I have watched it twice. The first time around was appealing, a good, likable movie. The second time around was satisfying. I caught all the minor details, and was pretty good. But seriously, it wasn' worth buying. It is a good piece. Looking at the underdeveloped plot, the story is very simple and the twist is not big enough and leaves the audience wet, just like the big fish. I was expecting a lot more from the film. I do not claim it is a bad movie because it is not. The beauty created by the visual and special effects in the movie were perfected brilliantly, but the plot of the story is average. The best advice I could have recieved prior to buying the movie is : rent it for free from a library; sign up for a free trial with some rental place and rent it; just pay the rental fee, if the rental cost is comparable to buying it than buy it, if you really don't care than it buy it. I would buy it for 7 or 8 bucks its worth about that much.

Somehow, Maggie is able to see Seth, despite the \\"rule\\" that angels are invisible. They fall in love, and Cage must choose between angelic mortality or a human life with Maggie.<br /><br />The view of the multitude of angels that walk the Earth among humanity is profoundly moving (both philosophically and cinematically)--as are the powerful emotions evoked in this film: grief, love, joy, wonderment...it's all there.<br /><br />Some great mystical themes in City of Angels include the role and presence of angels, how humans may be guided by an unseen Force, and the transcendent power of love.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Having grown up with Mary Martin's television performances of Peter Pan, I never imagined the character portrayed by anyone other than a middle aged woman. With Jeremy Sumpter's agile and gender correct performance, Peter Pan becomes the screen's most attractive youth who won't grow up. His is a rougish performance filled with adolescent bravado and impish cuteness. An all-round exceptional cast of actors whose credits rarely include children's stories, this film is a delight, and truly a film that is aimed at young as well as older audiences who might accompany them.    The subtext of the ambiguous \\"hidden kiss\\" that lurks in the corner of Wendy's full lips is sensuous and innocent as it should be. It is this element of budding sexuality depicted with tact that has no comparison in the innuendo-heavy bathroom humor typical of young teen oriented comedies that Hollywood produces ad nauseum. Wendy's attraction to Peter's seductive grin is a kind of first blush that is girlish and childish, but also exciting. Wendy's desire to follow Pan to the land of the lost boys where she will tell them stories of Cinderella and be a surrogate mother is playing at maturity but also flirtatious and filled with a curiosity of budding womanhood. It is an element rarely handled in film interpretations of children's genre, however, it was an unmistakable element always just below the surface in period 19th century literature. Films such as Hook and Disney's cartoonish version overlook the complex Victorian social elements that emerge.     All the young actors in this film are natural, enormously believable, and attractive. So believable are their adventures in Neverland against Hook and with Princess Tiger Lily and the Indians that we too are swept up joining the experience of fighting with swords and flying. This is heady fantasy and the director never permits the cast to become over the top.  In the lush setting of Neverland, the visual sensation is rich as color is used to convey more than just the physical.    Superb performances from versatile veteran actors such as Lynn Redgrave, a biddy aunt are created from the film but feel true to the storyline. However, it is a great character actor Jason Isaac doing double duty portraying the nebbish clerk-father James Darling, and the dastardly, evil, snidely Capt. Hook who fills the screen with vileness and a touch of distilled red-eye poison. Isaac's tragic/comedic villainous character presentation of Hook has the right mix of  believable and fearsome elements. It is only in the overlooked, \\"An Awfully Big Adventure\\" does an actor's performance of Hook by brilliant Alan Rickman have the similar bravado, weight, and believable panache. Isaac should have been acknowledged for his excellent work in the difficult dual role.    The film conveys the transitory beauty of childhood on the brink of change with deft handling, scenic drama, and swashbuckling action that is complex as well as bittersweet. As Peter and Wendy dance in the moonlight, their awareness of growing emotional maturity, although seductive, remains an enemy of Peter. His adamant decision never to grow up, to love and experience feelings as an adult is filled with layers of meaning that may be lost on younger audience members. And, when Hook informs Wendy the elements she is attracted to in Peter are the \\"riddle of his being,\\" he is also hinting at Freudian allusions to the father- daughter complex as well.     Wendy can not have feelings for the boy Peter as a lover, nor is she permitted to be attracted to the duo character of the father-enemy, James Darling/Capt. Hook. She is in limbo until imparting on Peter her hidden kiss, a gift that can only be given once in a young girl's life. Wendy's story is one of the inevitable. She must leave Neverland to be the woman, the storyteller, and the mother-wife.  Ultimately, it is only in Neverland that faeries exist and childhood is forever.  And,  where a thimble is a precious and powerful thing.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Bob Dylan is a hack, please stop comparing Ryan Adams to him before I puke all over.  This album may suck, but it's no bob dylan . . . the one dylan cd I own doesn't even make a decent coaster.
B000BVD460|5.0|first of all, it is not a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. It is called \\"The Hits\\". Meaning, they are not his greatest or best songs, just the singles that made alot of money. If you dont like eminem's wacky side, then why would you buy his album??? that makes no sense to me. Im a fan of his silly, kooky, and serious, straight ill rhymes. all the songs r hot. \\"Fack\\" is hilarious! \\"Shake That\\" is an aight song. \\"When I'm Gone\\" is beautiful, straight up. Em is the truth!
B000BVD460|5.0|This ISN'T Joseph. This is his oldest DAUGHTER.    I love Eminem. And I love this album. It's truly Eminem's greatest hits, and they're livly as ever. Below are my ratings:      2. FACK - 100/10! - Okay, I admit this song is GROSS. But it's so hilarious!!!! Especially the part with the gerbil (just listen to it). Note: If you are easily by sexual lyrics, skip this track.       3. Way I Am  - 100/10! It's one of my favorite songs on the album. Em just let's it all out. And it makes me feel better when I listen to it after a crappy day.    4. My Name Is - 100/10! This song is HILARIOUS! It's like a crazy bio of Eminem. Great beat and its fun to rap along with him.      5. Stan - 10/10. This song definitely shows a different side of Eminem. He gets deeper into a fan's feelings, which makes me wonder if Em gets any of these feelings. An appearance by Dido makes this a great listen.      6. Lose Yourself - 100/10! VERY INSPIRATIONAL. It's all about achieving the dream through a struggle. Worth repeating. You'll \\"Lose Yourself\\" in the music alright.      9. Without Me - 100/10! This song made me fall in love with Eminem's music. It's a great song as it's very funny. Eminem definitely shows some style.    10. Like Toy Soldiers - 100/10! Great song. The lyrics are great too.    11. Real Slim Shady - 100/10! I love this song. You really get the know the \\"Real Slim Shady\\". The music is weird, but nevertheless catchy.      12. Mockingbird - ONE MILLION/10! Everyone knows \\"Slim\\" for his hardcore appearance, but on this song, we hear nothing but Eminem. Slim seems to have vanished as Eminem goes through this heart-warming song dedicated to two of the most important people in his life. This is my second favorite track on this album.    13. Guilty Conscience - 1000/10! Slim is back, and this song shows it. He and Dre did a good job on potraying the good and bad consciences on this song.     14. Cleanin' Out My Closet - 1000/10! This song has a great beat and it's one of those songs where he gets out all his anger and puts in into a nicely written CLASSIC.      15. Just Lose It - 1000/10! - Funny and great to dance to. The lyrics are hilarious. (Though Em, we all KNOW that WAS a \\"stab at Michael\\").     16. When I'm Gone- ONE MILLION/10! This is my absolute favorite song on here. It made me cry when I heard it. It's beautifully written and the beat is wonderful. It's hard and soft at the same time.      17. Stan [Live][*] - 10/10. Great song. Bravo, Eminem and Elton John.    This album is truly a MASTERPIECE. So make sure you buy it today. You won't regret a penny. And even though it probably wasn't intended, \\"When I'm Gone\\" carries a message for us fans too.    When I'm Gone  Just Carry On  Don't Mourn  Rejoice   Everytime   You Hear The Sound Of My Voice    Something I certainly plan to do even 10 years later.    Signed,    Mrs. Nick Carter (The one thing Eminem and I DON'T agree on: boybands. Lol.)
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Oh people out there stop fussing about this album. Whether you like it or not, this is music ladies & gentlemen. People buy it and listen to it. As for this album. I like it. Especially with the new tracks. They do give more depth into her current work and she's changing with the times. No harm in that right? Anyway some of you always complain for a new change am I not correct? Mariah has proved she can stay in the music industry is that not encouraging or what? C'mon you people... Give her some slack. I'm no fanatic of her but I like her music. As for those that are de-naming Madonna. Stop it because it is really immature and you should know better than to do such stupid things. I also bought a copy of her album and it's very nice. I bought this album and Madonna's together so no fussing here. Madonna and Mariah both have been in the music industry for a very long time people. So it comes down to you either you listen or you don't. But don't make silly comments or grumble about this music because no good will come of it. Like as if you guys can write better music than this huh? I recommend before you buy an album. Listen to it for heavens sake to see whether you like it or not. So if you don't like it. You don't have to go and write silly remarks because it doesn't help. C'mon people be a little considerate, after all it's MUSIC people!!!!!

B000BKJ78U|3.0|i dont understand why everyone is complaining about this set...saying lucas released this just to make money. That cant be true because this set is priced at $20 cheaper then last years set. If he wanted to make money he would just release more of last years set which is priced at $20 dollars higher.  Anyways, i doubt ill be buying this set because i have last years.  I would give it 5 stars, but from what ive heard the lightsaber effects havnt been changed, that is the only complaint i have about the star wars DVD's- and as for the people who are mad that lucas \\"destroyed their beloved- orignal theatrical trilogy\\", in case you forgot, lucas is the one that released star wars in the first place, the one that he wasnt happy with because it really wasnt what he wanted at all, now that effects have changed, he has the chance to go back and make these movies how they were meant to be made, and as the prequal movies were released, there were some things he wanted to go back and improve and change in the OT to improve continuity....so if you dont want this set dont buy if....and if you want your beloved orignal theatrical set, go to ebay and buy the VHS's for $5, then go and copy them to dvd and there you go
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Hey, I just got theis CD the other day and I must say its better than American Life, this album is a huge comeback! This album has sold more in America than American Life sold worldwide! But is it a great album? Not hugely. Its very listenable but theres something about it that is very repetitive, I am not a huge fan of Remix albums, but Confessions On A Dance Floor sounds like one big remix album. Its not without its gems though, of course there is the huge international hit \\"Hung Up\\", which I suspect a lot of people love and the tracks \\"Sory\\"and \\"Get Together\\" really shine on this album.<br /><br />I am not a HUGE Madonna fanatic, so I cant reccomend another album over this, but please DO give it a try, a lot of people love this, or hate it, the question is where do you sit?
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|I was very impressed by this movie.  I really like the idea that this is not a simply comic book style movie like all the other Batman Movies were.  It is a true action movie.  There isn't all those crazy special effects, poor storyline and just plain silly looking characters. This gets you deeper into who Bruce Wayne really was and why he became this man of the Night.  I like that he was not a killer and wouldn't not murder anyone.  This makes him so much more respectable and honorable.  Christian Bale was perfectly cast for this part.  I thought he did a great job and I think this helps to put those other Batman movies out of memory.     I think this movie finally makes Batman completely respectable and no longer the joke the character had become.

0767821629|3.0|It starts as a typical VR story: Oh dear, if we can create worlds that are exactly like ours, is our world real or is it just another videogame?  What's reality?  What's reality?!<br /><br />Okay, so we've been here before.  Many many times before.  What is different about this movie is that it actually simplifies the situation by giving a solution to it.  In order to provide a sort of reasonable climax that isn't just throwing everything into the wind and saying, \\"Haha, now you aren't certain, are you?\\" this movie does what seems to be the blatantly obvious and gives the simulacrum a soul.<br /><br />THAT'S awesome because honestly it's nice to have a sort of direction for this philosophical discussion, and instead of making it, \\"If they have a soul, what does that mean to us?\\" it just ends with the, \\"But they have a soul... leave them alone.\\"  This is a refreshing break from everything else along this topic we've been subject to.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about all that's good about this movie.  Flat acting holding up a slightly misappropriated pace centers around a story that seemed to struggle, really struggle to find a way to fit in at least a little violence and a love story.  A few blatant plot-holes coincide with a hidden enemy whose motivations are incredibly contrived and forced.  This film doesn't feel or work as well as it should, and it seems utterly removed from the spectators, almost as if it's so caught in its own world that it doesn't really care about being a story, it just cares about getting the job done.<br /><br />Yet as a practice in mise-en-scene and as one of the few movies of its subject matter that decides to actually conclude its message, it's still something to be appreciated in its own way.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I have loved Shakira's music since she became my idol when I was 9 and \\"Pies Descalzos\\" was released  and inspired me to learn Spanish, so if you want a very objective review, you will have to look elsewhere. :) I am so annoyed that people seem to always compare her to Alanis Morissette...she is much younger and more beautiful and talented and original, I think! <br /> <br />The \\"danciest\\", catchiest tracks on the album are \\"How Do You Do\\", \\"Don't Bother\\", \\"Animal City\\", \\"Costume Makes The Clown\\", and \\"Timor\\". \\"The Day And The Time\\" and \\"Something\\" are the English versions of \\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"En Tus Pupilas\\", both which I think are much more beautiful in Spanish, but...I am not a Carlos Santana fan but I like \\"Illegal\\" very much. \\"Hey You\\" is sexy and quirky and \\"Your Embrace\\" is very sincere.  <br /> <br />\\"Dreams For Plans\\" is one of my favourite songs in the world now...I think everyone can relate to it and it is so beautiful, as is \\"How Do You\\". These 2, \\"Animal City\\", \\"Costume Makes The Clown\\" and \\"Timor\\" are at the moment my favourites of the album, but I really love them all. Gracias Shakira for making such amazing and groundbreaking music! :)
076790592X|5.0|\\"You have to find what's good true and beautiful in your life as it is now.  Looking back makes you competitive.  And, age is not a competitive issue.\\" (Albom 120).  Mitch Albom is an outstanding author as he uses his own life experience to bring this book to life; his book deserves a five star rating.  Diagnosed with (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, Morrie Schwartz was taught a lesson, but he was not the only one, as his student Mitch learns many lessons from regular Tuesday meetings.  While Mitch and Morrie prepare for their final thesis about the true values and lessons of life, a strong bond continues to grow.  Despite in-depth coverage concerning many \\"lessons of life,\\" there are some disappointing absences of content: Albom does not really touch on Morrie's relationship with his children and what they thought of their strong - willed <br />father and his opinions on life.  Readers of all ages could be drawn in as this captivating story unfolds; they will be prompted to contemplate you stop to think what life really is like or what it could turn out to be. <br /> With Morrie withering away from his illness his personality and outlooks on life are still carried on through his strong sense of knowledge and teaching.   Morrie was characterized as a loving, caring, knowledgeable, and good listening soul. \\"When Morrie was with you, he was really with you.  He looked you straight in the eye, and listened as if you were the only person in the world\\" (Albom135).   As Mitch visits with Morrie he learns lessons concerning love, emotions, the fear of death, and society today and how people fulfill their life in the wrong ways.  Morrie wanted his lessons to live on even after he was gone, so Mitch would bring his tape recorder every Tuesday and he would record Morrie's teachings so they could be remembered. <br /> One weakness the book had was the fact that Morrie's children were left out of the story, perhaps because Morrie, despite his illness, did not want theworld to stop turning.   We are left to wonder what his children thought about Mitch and Morrie's relationship; were they jealous?  Did they have a close relationship such as their dad and Mitch?  I believe that this would have added a different side to the story, as there were many unanswered questions concerning this untouched aspect.  Otherwise that is the only disappointment I found from this book. This book is one book I could pick up and read numerous times in life comparing myself to Morrie and contemplating his perspective. <br /> Morrie was such an inspirational character that anyone would stop to evaluate his or her life after reading this book.  It could touch the heart of any age from twelve on up.  This book is a learning tool for anyone, as demonstrated by Morrie in the following suggestions. \\"Do the kinds of things that come from the heart.  When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, you won't be longing for somebody else's things.  On the contrary, you'll be over whelmed with what comes back.\\" (Albom128).   This quote shows the value of life was taught so strongly in this book and how we should be thankful for what we have, learning not to be envious of others.  Morrie also teaches the importance of family life and marriage, being how sometimes people take loved ones for granted or are to selfish to love someone else.   <br /> Finally, Morrie's sayings will stick with readers for the rest of their days, as Mitch Albom does a wonderful job of using parallelism and making strong comparisons that leave an imprint on life. Tuesday's with Morrie not only changed the life of Mitch Albom but also, has changed the lives of  many others who have stopped to read this fascinating and heart wrenching story; about a dying man and his lessons that he wanted the world to hear.  <br />
B000002I2M|5.0|Jim Morrison was in Paris when this, The Door's sixth and final (the band would produce two unremarkable albums without Morrison but the Doors without him was not the Doors) studio album was released and went gold.  He would not return.  This was one of their very best and contained multiple successful singles. Some of them, Love Her Madly, LA Woman and Riders On The Storm were huge hits, but as usual, the often-neglected blues-influenced tracks are every bit as good.   <br /> <br />Morrison never intended for the Doors to be a 'pop' band, a la the Beatles.  Enjoy the variety, the blues, Morrison's poetry, and the excellent sounds of Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore.  Wonder what else he would have done if he had survived himself. <br /> <br />It is simply a must have for anyone interested in the Doors.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|One of the pleasures of movie watching, other than getting lost in the film itself, is the unexpected discovery of wonderful music. This was my experience in watching the new adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. <br /> <br />Dario Marianelli's score is both hauntingly romantic and enchanting to listen to.  I had never heard of this composer before but his score for P&P reminded me of works by Patrick Doyle (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\"), Gabriel Yared (\\"English Patient\\") and the score for \\"Persuasion.\\"  Many tracks are sweeping and unabashedly romantic and are pieces that you will want to get lost in.  There are a few that are more upbeat - music from the dance/ball scenes in the film - such as \\"Meryton Townhall,\\" \\"Militia Marches In\\" and \\"Another Dance\\" - but for the most part this is romantic music that goes hand in hand with this lovely film. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are \\"Stars and Butterflies,\\" \\"Living Sculptures of Pemberly,\\" \\"Liz on Top of the World,\\" \\"The Secret Life of Daydreams\\" and \\"Your Hands are Cold.\\" <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the film and especially if you are a fan of sweeping, romantic music, do yourself a favor and buy this excellent score.  I would be very surprised if Dario Marianelli does not get an Oscar nomination for Original Score this year as this is definitely one of the best scores I have heard so far this year.
6305161879|5.0|This is a heart-warming piece of gem and still is today with memorable and outrageous performances by all the characters in the film. The film has all the makings of an unforgettable comedy classic: there are mis-adventures, farcical situations, silly bedroom scenes, characters not talking or making any sense at all, cheating, deception etc. all through the movie. <br />It is especially up-lifting and should be seen during times of boredom, sadness or whenever you like and will cheer you up no sweat!  <br />The U.K. DVD is of good quality with a decent range of extras including deleted scenes presented by John Cleese, for UK region 2 viewers. It is certified 15 in the UK, (but the Amazon.com review states it is rated 18 for USA and Canada?)   <br />A must see.

0307276902|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I loved the honesty. James is very brave for sharing so much of himself with us. (Thank you for trusting us) I know his story will help many out there with or without addictions, it's very moving. It's written so different from other things that it's hard to discribe, it's gripping, honest,disgusting, scary, and the feeling of loyality and friendship are powerful. I loved it. Updated 6-2006- the honesty is gone, but still a good book, too bad he didn't sell it as fiction. Read it as fiction you will still enjoyed it.
6304936362|4.0|My first favorite television series was \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" and I had at least two models of the \\"Memphis Belle\\" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane.  When I was a kid my family was driving through California and there was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it.  A couple of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers are a lot smaller than I ever thought).  For all I know that particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film \\"Memphis Belle.\\"  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the \\"Memphis Belle\\" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio this October).<br /><br />The \\"Memphis Belle\\" (Serial No. 41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member.  The idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of American combat flights over Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.  The \\"Belle\\" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by Michael Caton-Jones (\\"Scandal\\") from the script by Monte Merrick (\\"Staying Together\\").<br /><br />That simply means that besides the fact that the \\"Memphis Belle\\" was named for a lady friend (Margaret Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen, Germany (the \\"Belle\\" flew there on its 21st mission).  The names of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named \\"Stuka.\\"  So if you want something closer to the \\"true\\" story of the pilot Robert Morgan and the \\"Memphis Belle\\" you want to check out William Wyler's 1944 documentary \\"The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress.\\"<br /><br />What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by incorporating a wide variety of clich&eacute;s from war movies involving airplanes.  Then there is the whole idea that Americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the Nazis.  So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner.<br /><br />Back at the base David Strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent  to celebrate the final mission of the \\"Belle.\\"  Of course, it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the \\"Memphis Belle\\" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might play better if it simply inspired by the \\"Belle\\" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well) .  But even if the \\"Belle\\" survives there areother several B-17 crews on the mission who will not.  Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else's job.sion who will not.

B000BMSTMS|1.0|I've been listening to korn since the mid-ninties when no one even knew who they were.  This album is a huge disappointment!  They basically threw their signature sound out the window that put them out the map and adopted an electro-pop-wanna-be metal sound for this poor excuse for an album.  The hard driving guitars, in your face bass, & pounding drums are long gone for some BS bubble gum pop sound! <br /> <br />Obviously the people who are giving this good reviews don't listen to metal or are employees of virgin records.  I'd be willing to bet that anyone who likes this cd thinks untouchables was korns best cd after this one! <br /> <br />There wasn't even a single song on this album that somewhat resembles a metal sound. <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this album after take a look in the mirror.  It seemed that with talitm they were going back to their roots...but not even close...very disappointing. <br /> <br />I'll think twice before I ever invest in this band again.  What a disgrace! <br /> <br />This was by far the worst way I've ever spent $15.  I should of threw my money out the window like I did with this cd.  If I would have burned this cd, it wouldn't have even been worth the .10 for the disc! <br /> <br />If MTV is on your TV 24/7 & you listen to the radio...this album is probably right up your alley. <br /> <br />If you think that korn's self titled album & life is peachy are their best albums & you like metal...stay far far away!
B00005AR3G|4.0|\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is simultaneously the closest and most far removed for the current generation of Disney animated features from \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" which enjoys the unique distinction of being the only such film ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.  It is the closest because it is about a royal pain who is turned into a creature, only the transformation was not intended to teach him a much needed lesson but rather to kill him (the spell goes awry), and he is not saved by a beautiful maiden but a big guy with lots of muscles (and a big heart).  However, that is not why this 2000 animated film is so far removed from \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"  It is because this is not an animated cartoon that is going to make you cry, this is simply one that is going to try and make you bust a gut laughing.<br /><br />The story is set in South America, mainly because it is a different setting, which allows the Disney animators to reference the great Mesoamerican civilizations without actually having to pick one over the others.  Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade) is the ruler of his kingdom and apparently has nothing more important to do than keep his groove going.  But then he makes the mistake of firing Yzma (voiced by the great Eartha Kitt), an old crone, who does not like being fired.  Helped, for lack of a better word, by a cook named Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), Yzma plots to kill Kuzco.  Instead of killing the emperor and reducing the film to a strange little tragic tale the length of an old fashioned cartoon, Kuzco is turned into a llama.<br /><br />This should make an impression on Kuzco, but it really does not.  He is still consumed with his plan to build a summer palace called Kuzcotopia on a hilltop that gets a lot of sun.  The fact that Pacah (voiced by John Goodman) lives there with his pregnant wife, Chicao (voiced by Wendie Malick), and their children does not bother Kuzco.  Even stranger, it does not seem to bother Pacah enough to stop him from help the llama who is emperor from getting back to normal and continuing with his plan.  But then even young kids will figure out that Pacah is the hero of this particular Disney adventure.  If anything, we are encouraged to care or show any concern for Kuzco only because Pacah does so.<br /><br />For me the person who makes \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" work is Eartha Kitt, perhaps best known to those of my generation who cared more about popular culture than the upper scale version of the same as one of the actresses who played Catwoman on television's \\"Batman.\\"  Her sultry voice was purr-fect back then and it is just as potent in this film.  The fact that she gets turned into a cat at one point in the festivities is not so much an in-joke as an homage.  All things considered \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is a trifle in the world of 21st century animated films (assume for the sake of argument the new millennium began when the chronological dial hit 2000), but Kitt's contribution easily justifies rounding up.o stop him from help the llama who is emperor from getting back to normal and continuing with his plan.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|As long has KoRn has existed, most of their songs had to do with the theme of anger, anger, a bit more anger and some anger. Which got a little old for me, especially on their last full-length release, \\"Take A look in the Mirror\\", Which was supposed to be their big comeback album where they went back to their original sound, but, for people like me, ended up a huge dissapointment. <br /> <br />For those who don't know, soon before this CD was made, Head, a great guitarist for the band left for his religious beleifs, and then came the news that KoRn would be working with Producers who have worked with Hilary Duff and other Pop Artists, made me, a big fan of KoRn, very sceptical about the CD's release.  <br /> <br />Still nervous from the info surrounding the CD, I went to the store and picked it up, only to be amazed.  <br /> <br />The new sound is fresh, original and good. The new lyrics are both intelligently written and emotional, and the recording sounds great. <br /> <br />That is, of course, with an open mind. If your looking for another Nu-Metal rip off band with two power chords per song, look elsewhere.  <br /> <br />The highlights of this CD would be \\"Twisted Transitor\\", \\"Souvenir\\", \\"Throw me Away\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Open Up\\", \\"Liar\\", \\"For No One\\", and \\"Tearjerker\\". The only weak song I found was \\"Coming  Undone\\", which was a little too repetetive for my taste, but it dosn't ruin the album.  <br /> <br />It's true that this album does have a MAJOR industrial influence too it, but it works really well with the music and dosn't distract from it or overcome the Heavy part of it. I applaud the new, dare i say more \\"mature\\" direction KoRn have taken with their music.  <br /> <br />And now, for my song review: <br /> <br />Twisted Transistor: Their single, very weird lyrics but nonetheless a fun song. <br />Politics: The music is really good here, lot's of effects and stuff.  <br />Hypocrites: One of the Heavier songs on this album, good guitar work.  <br />Souvenir:Very catchy, the lyrics and breakdown in this song are the highlights.  <br />10 or a 2 way: The first of the weaker songs on the album in my opinion, average song. <br />Throw Me Away: THIS is KoRn, Great Chorus and Jon's singing is amazing.  <br />Open Up: Another Amazing song, everything is perfect in this song.  <br />Coming Undone: Good guitar, but other then that very repetetive. <br />Getting Off: Another Heavy one, a pretty good song if you can get past the chorus of \\"Getting Off\\" repeated a million times... <br />Liar: Amazing Heavy song off this album, another one where everything seems to fit perfectly together.  <br />For No One: Diffrent, fast and fun but not a highlight or weak, just average.  <br />Seen it All: Their most Industrial strengthed song on the album, it turned out pretty decent in my opinion.  <br />Tearjerker: Their sad song, the vocals are really good and so are the lyrics.  <br /> <br />So in conclusion I very highly recomend this CD to any old KoRn fan or new, or just someone looking for something new and original with an open mind.  <br /> <br />Congrats Korn, this is your best CD yet.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This album immediately jumped up to the #3 spot of their first six records I own. It's only behind Ten and Vs.(current fav) and might have a chance to go higher. That being said, most people seem to need some time with this album to fully appreciate. I'll tell you how I came about to enjoying it right away. <br /> <br />To start, the opening song blared out of my speakers in my car as the bass shook the mirrors. That doesn't happen too often in my car but it was a rather explosive way to start the album. The song itself didn't stick with me until a few more listens but it's one of the better songs and opening songs in PJ's catalogue. The next two songs, God's Dice and Evacuation, are nothing too special and are just all around quality songs.  <br /> <br />The album really started for me with Light Years. Not only does it perfectly capture the feeling of the artwork PJ have become known for(heavy astronomy theme with explanations to the pictures in the back of the booklet) but it's the best song on the album. It's a slower song that as far as I can tell is about a woman close to the band that died. The chorus quickly got me moving and one of the best lines Ed has ever written is here as \\"We were but stones, your light made us stars\\". After that song blew me away I was hit by another strong song called Nothing As It Seems. The guitar riffs and short solos are breathtaking and really make this song work along with Eddie's haunting vocals. <br /> <br />'Thin Air' ups the tempo a little bit and is yet another strong song. At this point I've heard three very strong songs follow three average to good openers. I hoped it wouldn't end there and I was rewarded with Insignificance. The chorus is very memorable and Ed has a few of his signiature wails and such throughout. The next song, Of A Girl, is probably THE song that gets me moving the most. The beat is just amazing to go along with some great lyrics and vocals. I really can't do this song justice with words, you need tohear it.  <br /> <br />Though this album has some political threads it's far from overbearing. As a Republican for the most part I'm never offended throughout this album. I chalk that up to strong, open lyrics that don't try to bash me over the head. This is where Grievance comes in. Despite the message I must say this song has really grown on me to be one of my favorites. It's more of the bridge at the end of the song that gets me. 'Rival' has an interesting beginning of what sounds like 2 dogs fighting or one just growling. It kind of surprised me at first but the song that follows is good enough to make me forget it.  <br /> <br />Sleight of Hand is a hit or miss song with people. For those that don't know, the album is called Binaural because of the way it was recorded. It was meant to listen to with headphones and if you don't have two working speakers or ear pieces you're only going to get half of the songs. Sleight of Hand is really the perfect song to demonstrate this and I can't describe it other than 'haunting'. Soon Forget is a vintage quarky PJ song that isn't too long. You might very well soon forget it but it's not bad. Parting Ways is a solid closer though far from their best way to wrap up an album. <br /> <br />All in all, this album to me was much heavier and had a greater variety of great songs than any of their previous three albums(which are all great in themselves). If you find yourself having a hard time getting into this just give it more listens. It's defintely one of their most underrated albums and needs to be any every PJ fans collection. As always if you're new to Pearl Jam start with Ten and work your way up.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|I'm not really a Britney Spears and I don't have any of her cds.  So when her greatest hits came out I went out and bought it.  It is really good it has all of her greatest songs on it.  and we all know that she can't sing but get over it.  The best songs on the cd are my prerogative, toxic, i'm a slave 4 u, oops...I did ti again, everytime, boys, overprotected, lucky, outrageous, and do somethin'.  those are the best song on the cd.  Hope this helps someone.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Ok,How to start, i spent my money in this album, and it was a dissapointment, i've been a fan of Korn, since the beggining but i think that Brian \\"Head\\" Welch wasn't the only thing they have lost, they also lose their touch and for me this is the crappiest album i've ever heard in my entire life, none of the songs are good and im truly sorry to say this but this is a big dissapointment, it's good that Jonathan aint bitchin' bout his past anymore, but the change of new metal to pop crap rock is awful, cause this ain't heavy at all, and it took me by surprise cause it has been commented \\"the evolution of heavy\\", but these days there are heavier bands around. For any of you guys that it's planning to buy this album, don't spend your money in this, listen to their old stuff or any real heavy bands like Chimaira, Trivium or whatever you want to listen, but please don't spend your money in this, you will thank me.
0553801503|3.0|Well. What can i say? After reading the book i wasn't realy disapointed. It is still Martin's magic way of writing, but i think he lost his perspective. I don't think it was a good idea to split this novel. It just doesn't answer many questions that were made in first three novels, and its frustrating. It would have been much better to include all the characters and give them little less time. But there is one more thing, Martin has developed so many characters that its nearly impossible to put them all in one book, and still make it under 1000 pages. Now, i dont complain of him making so many characters, its just that this novel serie is looking cripled right now and thats not satisfying to anyone. Martin has a great power of making chatracters real, but with this sequence he lost tension in the storyline, and for that, i give three stars. And it would have been an easy 5 star novel. Bad mistake.
0385510454|1.0|So formulaic. See, what you do is travel to Italy on the riches of your last book, dream up a half-baked plot, insert tour trivia, study a few maps, blast the keys for a few days, and submit to publisher. Yeesh, I'm tired of established authors doing this. Grisham ought to be spanked--no, held hostage in a drab, cramped hotel room in Milano and forced to drink cappuccino after noon. His Italian lesson stints are BORing, the main character draws no sympathy--ever, the agents are one-dimensional, and the idea that a power broker of his ilk can't outwit his snoop handlers in the first 20 pages had me wondering whether this guy maybe did go a little crazy in stir. Save your money and your precious reading hours. You want Italian, go Berlitz.
0399152717|3.0|I have been a Cussler fan for years.  However, it is obvious that he is running out of unique ways to write and now all books under his name (yes I understand he doesn't actually write the Kurt Austin series) are formulaic.  However, this bookd nor this series deserve the criticism they get.  It is a fantasy/adventure nove and yes after so many books with the same formula it is getting a bit old but Cussler books are like your favorite old clothes, not always fashionable but always a good fit.  If you are a first time Cussler fan then start with the Pitt series (preferably an early book before Dirk decided he was going to bloodily kill the evil villain).
B000002MIF|5.0|Much of what the Smiths represent has already been addressed in these reviews, so I will share only a few other things in addition to personal recollections of the band.<br /><br />The Smiths were all too brief a force in music, but what they lacked in time, they made up for in fecundous output. Few groups recorded as much or as brilliantly as the Smiths did in their four year tenure as kings of british pop. Musically, no one even came close to the sheer beauty of what Johnny Marr created. Any guitarist worth his salt will admit as much, but music was only half of the equation. Morrissey is, like Robert Smith and Ian McCullough, a wordsmith of the highest order, creating rarely seen literary parallels between himself and the writers he so often championed.<br /><br />As for the man's sexuality.... well, for all of the press it has received over the years, it was simply irrelevant to his craft, and he only underscored that notion by remaining aloof and deliberately ambiguous on the subject. For those who actually remember the Smiths while they were together, Morrissey was a declared celibate throughout his partnership with Marr, Joyce and Rourke, having given himself over to his art to such a degree that, when Johnny split, the man was literally bedridden.<br /><br />The Smiths. Where would I have been without them? Some like to talk of this group as depressing but they got me through some very bad times indeed. Rarely had I heard anyone speak so honestly about his feelings... and those lyrics often reminded me that I was not the only one out there suffering. As unbelievable as it may sound, I think this band may have actually saved my life, and it's hard to speak objectively of such an influence... but anyone who has been desperate and heard the optimism in 'please, please, please...' will understand.

076790592X|5.0|\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship\\" (Albom 174).  Tuesdays with Morrie is a well written biography by Mitch Albom and deserves a four and one-half-star rating for the lessons taught by Morrie Schwartz.  Tuesdays with Morrie is an old dying man's autobiography written by Detroit sportswriter, in which he described important lessons in life.  Ultimately, the strongest point about this biography involves lessons about relationship, the importance of life, and ways to deal with death; the weakest point is that the original meeting transcript is not included, and the appeal of this biography is to readers of all ages, as the author talks about the real meaning of love, emotions and friendship.  <br /> The strongest point about this novel is Morrie's philosophies, all of which stem from life experiences.    From Ted Koppel's show, Mitch found that his college `coach' was very sick, and he therefore decided to visit him on a Tuesday.  After a few Tuesdays' visits, Mitch became interested in Morrie's philosophies and he continued to visit Morrie on every Tuesday until Morrie died.  During his visits with Morrie, his \\"coach\\" taught he important lessons in life:  feelings, regrets, death, family, emotions, money, love, marriage, culture, forgiveness, having a perfect day, and the fear of aging.  Out of all the topics that they discussed, the chapter on forgiveness catches my eyes.  In this chapter, Morrie said, \\"Forgive yourself before you die.  Then forgive others.\\" (Albom 164).  Morrie explained this topic by giving his own life experience about his friend, \\"Norman\\".  When Norman failed to contact Morrie's wife following her serious operation.  In spite of Norman's attempt to makeup, Morrie was hurt from this incident and decided to drop their relationship.  After Norman's death, Morrie felt sad, because he never got to forgive Norman.   <br />This book is so good that I really have a hard time looking for the book's weaknesses.  After searching for a long time, the only weakness that I found is that Mitch did not present a full original transcript from the meetings with Morrie.  If the full transcript had been included in this book, they might have drawn a much better picture and the biographical account might have been even better.  I would like to see movie Tuesdays with Morrie and see if the original transcript was included and if it was, what difference it would make.    <br />This biography is appealing to people of all ages, because the author has talked about the real meaning of love, emotions and friendship.  Morrie knew that he was suffering from ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) diseases and also knew the short time left in his life.  Instead of worrying about his life and making it worse, he chose to tell his life experience to Mitch.  Mitch did not have any contact with his brother, David, for a long time.  Mitch learned lot of lessons from his Tuesdays with Morrie and contacted his brother after Morrie passed away.        <br /> Tuesdays with Morrie is filled with emotions, love and common sense.  This book also tells that everybody should always keep in touch with old friends and enjoy their life at all ages.  Mitch Albom has done a fantastic job in including what he had learned from Morrie.  The story about Morrie was so good that in the year 1995, Ted Koppel had released three interviews in ABC's Nightline.  When Koppel ends his run on Nightline on November 22, the final show will feature an interview with Mitch Albom and highlights from the year 1995, during which the interviews with Morrie took place.  In personnel life, Koppel admires Morrie.  Morrie's positive and comic attitude for dealing with his disease can help people have a more an optimistic way to cope with their own sickness.  I liked this novel, because it reminded me not to take everything for granted, but to relish the moment, absorb it, learn from it and be thankful for it.  For example, I gave this novel to one of my close friends to read.  This novel is so emotional that she was crying while reading this novel.  Morrie is portrayed as someone who was respected in society, and his honesty and personality made me believe him as he was my own father.   <br />\\"Every night, when I go to sleep, I die.  And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.\\"  -  Mahatma Gandhi                  <br />
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This album was amazing. Some people won't probably like it and claim KoRn is dead for the millionth time, but it's all good. Obviously KoRn is doing something right because they're still here and still profitable. I believe this is the album that will bring them back into the spot light. If you came in expecting this album to be the self titled or another version of Life Is Peachy, then turn the other way now. This is a new sound for KoRn and I believe it works really well for them. It's unfortunate that other bands have ripped off their style so much but KoRn is a survivor and it's obvious on this album. The lyrics are great, the vocals are great, and the whole new sound, yet somewhat industrial, stays true. This album is definately for the open minded who truly enjoy music. I would recommend this to any rock fan that isn't jaded.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This movie opens a brief window on the life of a hard-working and under-appreciated  Mexican immigrant, Flor Moreno.  Paz Vega nails this role without overplaying the part.  The message is not forced but the ending was painful to watch.   I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie as I am not an Adam Sandler fan.  Refreshing to see him in a more serious role.  Sarah Steel was a delight as his daughter - we don't want her to ever grow up. Cloris Leachman is a national treasure.

B000005J08|5.0|John Zorn hails from New York and has been one of the most interesting and exciting figures in contemporary music for years.  He appears to be of limitless talent, acquiring quite a reputation for his wild eclecticism.  That eclecticism is wildly abundant on this fine, fine album, as Zorn and Company rage thru the music of Ornette Coleman, Henry Mancini, Ennio Morricone, John Barry, and of course Mr. Zorn himself.  They blaze through jazz, swing, blues, free jazz, noise, rock, thrash, and surf- often in the same song.  This is great music for today's attention-span addled human.  In fact, I think this would actually be a great album for youngsters with an interest in jazz to listen to.  It is fast moving, often changing, and definitely never boring.  I haven't listened to this CD for awhile (until today), and I forgot how enthralling it is.<br /><br />`Naked City' was my first John Zorn album and it remains my favorite (along with his Occult masterpiece I.A.O.).  This wonderful disc starts out with `Batman'; Zorn's uptempo envisioning of what Batman's theme should sound like- and it totally kicks ass.  This is followed by Morricone's `The Sicilian Clan'.  Zorn's saxophone sounds great on this track (and I usually HATE the saxophone).  Next up is `You Will Be Shot', a nifty Zorn original that changes just about every ten seconds; touching on rock, noise/thrash, and blues/swing.  I could go on and on; fruitlessly attempting to describe track after track.  That however is beginning to seem increasingly pointless as I listen to this spectacular album.  It sounds so clich&eacute;, but one must truly listen to this album for themselves to have any kind of understanding for how much ass it kicks.<br /><br />One of the things that Mr. Zorn seems to have a knack for, is assembling the right band for the right project (much in the same way Miles Davis did).  The band that he put together for `Naked City' was absolutely perfect, and up to the task of tackling these diverse, high energy arrangements.  Bill Frisell on guitar, Wayne Horvitz on keys, Fred Firth on bass, and Joey Baron on skins were the perfect partners in crime for this wicked creation.  I would've loved to catch this amazing band live.<br /><br />This is a hell of an album.  I own LOTS of music, and this is by far one of the most diverse releases I have.  Not many bands could pull off the ridiculous changes present here.  On paper, this should be a mess.  However thanks to John Zorn's vision and skill (and that of his band mates) this works wonderfully- way better than it should.  If you are interested in Zorn and have yet to delve into his intimidating and massive catalogue, this is a great place to start.  If you are a fan of Zorn, you undoubtedly have this excellent and timeless release.ments.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium is a Dream Theater album that in many ways is unlike any of their previous albums. Of course, that's saying something when we're talking about a progressive rock outfit, but this album has a form and style unlike any other albums that they'd release (closest comparison is that of the first disk, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence). The album has hard rockers, emotional ballads, and epics to boot. For that reason, if you were just trying out Dream Theater and are considering buying an album, I'd stop here first. <br /> <br />The album starts out with the rocker \\"The Root of All Evil\\", which is the third part in a series of songs that last was heard on \\"This Dying Soul\\" from Train of Thought. It's a great way to start the album as it fondly recalls the heavy rock of the previous album - but it doesn't quite dive that deep into the metal roots. After that, the album changes pace from one song to the other, often shifting styles. The 24 minute epic closer, \\"Octavarium\\", recalls some of Pink Floyd's Waters era work, while many of the other songs of the album often feel like modern interpretation of Styx or Kansas hits. <br /> <br />Instrumentally, this album really features a band that is turning all the wheels in harmony. As a result, there is no real performance in this album that stands out - not even Portnoy's drumming or Petrucci's guitar work - it all blends together to create a wall of sound and music. This can be good and bad, depending on your stance, as the vitruoso performances are somewhat missing here. Thusly said, there is still AMAZING work by all members of the band, especially from Jordan Rudess, who is ever so becoming the ideal Dream Theater keyboardist.  <br /> <br />This is not the prog-rock masterpiece that some have been waiting for, nor is it their best album - but \\"Octavarium\\" covers all the bases on Dream Theater's sound and concept, making this a great album to start out on.

0060825219|1.0|When I heard of the subtext, \\"A Novel of Obsession,\\" I was immediately interested as that subject, and its tendency to be construed as love, fascinates me.  In addition, I knew that the author was widely read and purchased throughout the world, so I figured I was in for a treat. <br />No - I was majorly disappointed. <br />The novel really seemed that it was striving to be about love, and what it should ideally be.  I would think a novel about love would have people who behaved lovingly, characters who the reader could love.  Instead, Coelho's book was a diatribe about what's wrong with society today, how loveless it can be.  Using the characters voices to lecture the reader about the wrongs of society (e.g. people are too focused on material things (this from a wealthy author/narrator!), people put on unsavory facades to protect themselves, people simply aren't honest with themselves or others - as if we didn't know this), he tediously repeated himself until it was annoying.  Perhaps, if the author wanted to teach about love, he could have expounded on what love is rather than what it isn't. <br />The simple writing was ok, but it's more enjoyable to read a self-help book if I want to learn about love. <br />And if someone is looking for books about obsession that are fun to read, try Joyce Carol Oates or A.M. Homes. <br />This is the first book I have read by Coelho; it will also be the last.

B000BMSTMS|1.0|I am HUGE Korn fan and found some tracks respectable on the last 2 albums. Usually when a band looses a member and releases a greatest hits album it signals the end. This unworthy half hearted effort prooves it. Industrial grind with synth went out in the late 90's. I swear if the cover didnt say \\"Korn\\", that i was listening to a Marilyn Manson album - Mechancial Animals? This album is already on ebay and I had it for 5 hours! Horrible. To much talent wasted - Hate to say it, but time to hang it up and while Head is out finding God, the remaining four need to take a look in the mirror and find some heart, passion and vigor...or they can stay on whatever side they are on. <br />

Tim burtons whole idea that one person could be all of the oompa's was also very stretched.  Some of the songs are very good but again they just try to hard and fall so short.

0064471047|5.0|The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first book C.S. Lewis wrote in the Chronicles of Narnia series in the early 1950's. The story is of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are sent into the country during the bombing raids on London in World War II. The children arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. On a rainy day with nothing to do the children decide to play a game of hide and seek. As the children are hiding Lucy stumbles upon a room whose only contents are a blueglass bottle and and old wardrobe. Lucy chooses the wardrobe for a hiding place however as she manuevers through it she is magically transported to the land of Narnia, where it is always winter but never Christmas. In Narnia she meets the faun, Mr. Tumnus who tells her of the White Witches magical enchantment over Narnia and of the prophecy of Cair Parivel/Aslan's return which will bring the reign of the White Witch to its end. This is as far as I am going to go in giving away the plot of the book. This book is Number 2 in the series the Chronicles of Narnia. I would suggest when reading the books to read them in the order which Lewis wrote them. This story will delight both young and old alike. It is a classic to read over and over again with your family.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I must say that the I thoroughly enjoy the new Korn album, \\"See You on the Other Side.\\"  As more Korn is always going to be better than the alternative, I truthfully find myself wondering if I am giving it two thumbs up simply because it is more music from the people I've grown up with or if the album is actually \\"good\\" in a substantial way that is worth not only my money, but more importantly my time.  This album is definitely a departure from everything Korn has done in the past, which is understandable since Korn lost a significant 20% of its band last February.   <br /> <br />While not nearly as raw and \\"crunching\\" as their last studio effort, \\"Take A Look in the Mirror,\\" or their first two albums, \\"Korn\\" and \\"Life is Peachy,\\" \\"SYOTOS\\" is both bludgeoning and thoughtfully driven in a manner that only Korn can do.  There are significantly more synth-type effects on this album which are for more reminiscent of early Nine Inch Nails or \\"Mechanical Animals\\" (late-90's) era Marilyn Manson, and possibly even some late Bowie or Bau Haus.  That said, the CD obviously cannot \\"rock\\" as hard as a CD that is loaded with multiple tuned-down-7-string guitars (which Korn has used since their conception).  Instead of focusing on Munky's solo guitar work, the CD seems more geared towards producing the heck out of Jonathan's voice while meshing Fieldy's bass and David's drums to an almost blurry conglomeration of sound that is not better or worse than Korn's previous rhythm sections, but considerably different.   <br /> <br />The CD is heavy.  Don't let my statements of \\"synth-effects\\" and solo guitar work fool you.  There are some extremely infuriated Jonathan Davis lyrics and couple with some very rage-ful screaming on Jon's part.  Fieldy and David lay a foundation that allows the music to churn forth from the musical equivalent of the gates of Hell.  And don't think that by \\"solo guitar work\\" I am referring to guitar-solos.  I'm not.  I'm simply stating that the interplay of Head and Munky's guitars is now obviously removed from the music and Munky's guitar is noticeably, and sadly on its own.  That is the problem with this album.  While it is disputable, I have always believed that their third album, \\"Follow the Leader,\\" was Korn's most musically brilliant album because the interwoven, sweeping, crushing guitars of Head and Munky were at their most extreme, most intricate, and most brilliant.  So many sounds that occur on that CD cannot remotely be emulated with only one axe-man, and that is where this CD suffers.  The excellent production, and in my opinion top-notch song-writing that make up \\"SYOTOS\\" cannot make-up for Head's absence.   <br /> <br />Still, the CD has some top-notch rocking, namely on the track, \\"Liar,\\" which features the first real Jon Davis impromptu, scat- noise-making freak out since \\"Follow the Leader,\\" and truthfully, it fits very well, and brings back the memories... <br /> <br />Anyway, that's my long review of this CD.  If you have listened to Korn since the beginning, do not expect what you heard in the beginning.  The band was forced to change with Head's departure, and their change is extremely evident.  If you've only listened since, say, \\"Untouchables,\\" than this CD may be more up your alley and what you're expecting from Korn.  All I can say is that I think it is well worth the time and money, and when I wanted to break some s*** tonight this CD already came in handy and provided me the ability to rock out instead of putting a hole in my wall.
B000BP86OG|2.0|When the Darkness exploded onto the scene with \\"Permmission\\", I was elated. After a decade of boring, mundane, alternative rock,(I.E.) Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls, Coldplay,and so on, those English lads had me sold about one second into \\"Black Shuck\\". Then when I saw the video for \\"I Believe In A Thing Called Love\\" my respect for what they were doing only grew. Their cocky attitude, metallic image, and bombast, harkened back to the glory days of Zepplin,Kiss,Purple,AC/DC. Do not get me wrong, while their influences are evident, they are as original as tommorow's news. \\"Permission\\" was raw, the vocals wailed, the guitars ripped, and the production sounded \\"live in the studio\\". <br />Very in your face and organic. The songwriting smelled of leather and studs and flashpots, very moving. I give Permission 6 out of 5 anyday!! I have been eagerly anticipating the next offering from Justin and the boys. All I can say is how bitterly dissapointed I am with \\"One Way Ticket\\". Roy Thomas Baker is the worst thing that could possibly happen to The Darkness. Granted the songwriting was not as strong as \\"Permission\\", but what really killed the album was the fact that it was produced into oblivion. From layers upon layers of cheesy vocals in almost every chorus to the vasectomy that Dan's guitars have received, and \\"Girlfriend\\" makes George Michael's former band \\"Wham\\" sound like \\"Motorhead\\"!!! I know that this is an opinion that may be unpopular but, I think concerning the Darkness and rock/metal in general, less is more. The first Black Sabbath album was recorded in about eight hours according to Tony Iommi, need I say more. The guys can play, Justin can sing, it does not need to sound like a symphony honoring over-engineering. There is only one song on here that really grabs me and that is \\"Hazel Eyes\\". Other than that I could live with out ever hearing the others again. I hope next time aroung the lads will strip everything down, plug in, crank up and kick ass!!!!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|For starters, it is a shame that the three songs on the bonus CD are not included on the \\"normal\\" release of this album.  Truth be told, they are definitely amongst the best 3 songs Korn recorded for this CD.  \\"Last Legal Drug\\" and \\"Eaten Up Inside\\" are just wicked.  The video of the concert footage is okay, and the packaging is also very neat in a Marilyn Manson, \\"Tool-esque\\" packaging originality manner.  Hopefully the BSC will be as kool as Korn Kamp was when it launches, but we don't know yet so I cannot assess the worthwhileness of that feature of this album.   <br /> <br />I must say that the I thoroughly enjoy the new Korn album, \\"See You on the Other Side.\\"  As more Korn is always going to be better than the alternative, I truthfully find myself wondering if I am giving it two thumbs up simply because it is more music from the people I've grown up with or if the album is actually \\"good\\" in a substantial way that is worth not only my money, but more importantly my time.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|After reading about the Sony copy protection, there is no way I would buy this CD, even though I could play it on my CD player and run it into my computer and re-record it into standard audio files.  \\"Copy Protection\\" is just that - protection.  It is not \\"Copy Prevention\\", which is what the record companies want but cannot achieve.   <br /> <br />I understand that protection schemes that make it difficult to copy CD or DVD content will keep many individuals from copying that content, but even if only a few people go to the trouble to copy the content, it will soon be available to all online at some file-sharing site. <br /> <br />When the record companies make it difficult to use your own purchased music, then it's time to get it for free.  Hopefully this chapter in digital rights management will initiate a backlash against the RIAA and their losing battle against file sharing. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate that the artists get stuck in the middle of this tug of war.
B000AM6MMS|5.0|This movie was awesome!! If you love Orlando Bloom then this is a good movie for you!! It is very violent and alittle bit gory.....but other then that it is a great movie!! <br /> <br />the longest yard, the perfect man, madagascar, the pacifer
B00080ZG10|4.0|The critics panned it, the audiences stayed away, the Academy didn't give it it's due - all in all \\"The Aviator\\" was a theater-goer's disappointment all around. So maybe I'm a sucker for a beautiful period-piece or maybe I just don't know a stinker when I see it, but I say that \\"The Aviator\\" was a superb film that I will watch again & again.<br /><br />Scorsese has made some mediocre movies (Gangs of New York & New York, New York come to mind) but this isn't one of them. The casting was brilliant, the cinematography inspired (watch how certain scenes of different time-periods have a \\"vintage\\" cinematic look to them), the music fabulous and the acting spot-on. For those who thought DiCaprio was too \\"baby-faced\\" or too young to play Hughes, take a look at a few Hughes photographs from the 30's and you will see that he was not the more rugged looking fellow from after his near-fatal plane crash. The baby-face works here and lends even more to the realism that DiCaprio gives to his portrayal of HH.<br /><br />I was captivated by Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn as well as Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Ava Gardner. Both actresses did a bang-up job of giving their characters a panache and fire that would have been necessary to match them against such a formidable lover and opponent as Hughes was to these two paramours. I was disappointed, however, that there was no mention made of Hughes' well known bisexuality and his alleged connection to the murder of rumored lover David Bacon (of The Masked Marvel serial movie fame). This could have been a great side story and I feel it was an opportunity missed by the screenwriters & the director.<br /><br />All in all, this is a movie I will list in my personal top 20 and once I own the DVD will watch over & over just as I do Tombstone, Titanic, Malcolm X & Wyatt Earp. If you haven't seen it because of the negative comments here or those given by critics at it's release give \\"The Aviator\\" an opportunity to captivate you. If you've seen it but disliked it because it's not an \\"action-packed-thriller\\" watch it again and make note of the fabulous sets, the wonderful cinematography, the music and the dead-on portrayal of Hughes by Leonardo DiCaprio. And for heaven's sake if for nothing else watch it for the slick flying and aviation engineering history lesson.<br /><br />This film is definitely a winner in my book!you.

B000AU9UYM|3.0|This is the dark side of DC comic come to life.  Batman has always been the most complex and interesting superhero.  He has no special powers.  He appears to be neurotic if not psychotic.  He is as creepy as any of his foes. <br /> <br />The film shows the origin of the character, from the murder of Wayne's parents, to his rebellion leading to indoctination into a secret cult that opposes corrupt societies.  In a cult ceremony, he is asked to murder a convicted killer.  He refuses, as he cant break with societies mores, and feels the man must bear trial.  Not judgment by the cult.  Yet Wayne then kills several cult members in the process of destroying the ceremony.  This makes sense how?  Not exactly well written.   <br /> <br />Yet these scenes as a cult knight, with Liam Neeson's cult leader, are the best in the film.  Batman's uniform, skills and mission all spawn directly from this cult, thus 'the dark knight.'  The film then diverges for 90 minutes and is pretty conventional Batman.  Only at the end does Batman meet his creator/nemesis in the form of the knight leader.  The whole film would have been more interesting if it kept its focus on how the cult's principles form Wayne's own, his break from the knights, and realization that the cult is responsible for many of the problems of the society it undermines. <br /> <br />While this is the 'hip' Batman, the Batman-Joker axis with Nicholson was truly more complex and interesting.  Worth seeing.
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has written some cheesy books, and while all of them are good in their own way, nothing compares to A Walk to Remember. Maybe it's just the fact that it's easier to relate to, since this is about teenage romance instead of adult romance. Still, I love this book, the emotions and feelings are so realistic and portrayed excellently. Be ready for a real tear-jerker.
B000AP04EW|3.0|The point of this film is basically to ogle Jolie or Pitt as its stars, as they hate each other, no they wuv each other, no they hate each other... etc. <br /> <br />The film is weaker than say the War of the Roses.  These married spies realize they are enemies, try to kill each other, but never really lapses into darkness or satire, which is the only place husband and wife shooting at each other can go. <br /> <br />Jolie is effective as a superspy, while Pitt not so much.  Soon the two team up of course, and the action heats up as the two run out of things to say.  The chemistry of Jolie/Pitt and the simple formula are a good match though, and before you can say 'no fault state', the film is resolved leaving the audience mildly entertained.
0307276902|5.0|A fascinating, yet dreadful look into the world of substance abuse. The kind of epic teenagers should read to learn the real truth behind drugs and alcohol. The saying \\"reality can be far more interesting than fiction\\" applies seamlessly to this tale. Funny how we are too often most captivated by horror and misfortune...you won't put this one down.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails is back, and this cd represents a rebirth of sorts for this group.  They've created another masterpiece, something new and fresh, without losing their identity and edge like other bands (i.e., Korn - \\"See You On The Other Side\\" & Limp Bizkit - \\"The Unquestionalbe Truth\\").  \\"With Teeth\\" is by far one the best albums released this year.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Finally, a Depeche Mode album I want to listen to repeatedly. That hasn't happend since Song of Faith and Devotion!
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This album is just plain awful!  This latest effort by Korn lacks melody, crafty guitar riffs, and teeth.  It has been down hill for these guys ever since they released \\"Untouchables.\\"  This latest creation, \\"See You On The Other Side,\\" is a desperate attempt at change in order to boost sagging album sales.  Well, the experiment didn't work.  I can't blame Brian Welch (a.k.a. Head) for leaving this group...he knew that the end was near.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Top Gun is a movie that I have seen more times than any other flick in the world.  The dialogue is not the greatest but what can you expect from DoN Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Tom Cruise is very charismatic and fits the character very well.  I was not suprised that they tried to reinvent this movie repeadetly.  The aerial scenes are astounding even twenty years after the initial release.  Many actors are in this flick and are some of the biggest stars today.  From beginning to end, this movie keeps you on the edge of yor seat.  It has the best soundtrack ever made too, take me on your mighty wings!
B000BB1MHS|1.0|I should have waited to see this when it came on cable television instead of wasting my money on the DVD. It was boring and uninspired. Personally, I thought it was a huge waste of Johnny Depp's talents. He did a good job for the part he was dealt but he was dealt a lousy part. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the original Gene Wilder movie much more and I intend to read the book but I found this movie to be very boring and not the least bit funny or interesting. It was just plain dull. <br /> <br />I was not familiar with Tim Burton or I would not have even purchased it in the first place. I got my first taste of Tim Burton with the preview for the movie \\"Corpse Bride\\" before the movie started. If I never see anything by Tim Burton again it will be too soon (and I suspect this was the best of his movies).
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I've been a devoted Enya fan my whole life, and after A Day Without Rain I eagerly awaited the next release for five years. <br /> <br />The first thing I noticed when I listened to Amarantine was that Enya has changed over the years since ADWR.  Most of the songs have an odd singsong-y quality to them that was not present in her previous work.  The songs by and large have simpler melodies, and I was disappointed by the lack of complexity.  Enya's music normally entrances the listener and creates a state of mind all its own.  I had great difficulty getting into that state with this album.  In a way the songs reminded me of a small child, more skipping around and \\"me\\" focused than before.  Many of the lyrics don't fit the melodies as they should, and a lot of the lyric songs sound more as if they should have been instrumental pieces.  I believe there was only one non-vocal piece on Amarantine, and if some of the songs with lyrics had been left as instrumental pieces, the album as a whole would have been more appealing. <br /> <br />On to the good points, songs like \\"It's In the Rain\\" and \\"The River Sings\\" evoked more of the feel of A Day Without Rain and Enya's older sound in general, capturing the slightly mournful melodies in \\"It's In the Rain\\" and the characteristic and energizing chants in \\"The River Sings.\\"  I hope that, whenever Enya releases another album (and I hope that it will not be another five years), it will fall more along the lines of the music on A Day Without Rain.  Overall this album sounds somewhat experimental, and I hope that through this experiment Enya finds the best music she can produce.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|After Mesmerize, well, mesmerized me, I was expecting its sister album to be equally gripping.  Unfortunately, for me at least, this album is a \\"one hit wonder\\", and even that hit I cringe when I hear it (too many years of classical choir training make their attempts at a hard rock ballad painful).  I've tried listening to the album several times, to see if it will grow on me ... it didn't.  And now, with Mesmerize playing in the background, I can firmly say that this new album by SOAD fell FAR below my expectations.  I hope that whatever Muse watched over them for Mesmerize re-visits soon.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash, an American Music Legend, recorded his last record \\"The Man Comes Around\\".  It might possibly be his greatest.  Every song that is recorded by Cash on this album is nothing but absolute brilliance.  \\"Hurt\\" may be the best song on this album, but that can be heavily debated with \\"The Man Comes Around\\" and \\"I Hung my Head\\".      If you can, buy the version of the album that comes with the video \\"Hurt\\".  The video is just as, if not more, powerful than the song itself.    Johnny Cash's vocals have never sounded better.  If I could give this album six stars, I would.  Hell, I would give seven.      R.I.P. Mr. Cash.  You will not be forgotten.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|\\"Precious and fragile things, need special handling, my God what have we done to you, we always tried to share, the tenderness of care, now look what we have put you through\\".  These marvelous lyrics are from the most recent DM's song \\"Precious\\" from their new album, Playing the Angel. Impressively, DM has done it again with fantastic synth-pop sounds. The music formula DM always uses is a strong rhythm, especially with their detailed ballads which add a huge personality to their music. Not only is Depeche Mode virtually indestructible, the pioneering British synth-pop keeps getting better. Depeche Mode's fascinates their audiences with wonderful romantic lyrics from \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" or \\"Personal Jesus.\\" This awesome group genre is modern rock or retro-alternative. Just like the song \\"World in my Eyes\\" a dramatic song from their Violator album, it is what made me fall in love with DM even more. <br />The album Playing the Angel contains electronic rhythms, fabulous lyrics to relate too with a bit of spice. The music DM has created is from the synthesizer sounds to the extraordinary vocals that hold steady. DM's music sounds are very mellow and empowering making DM's fans listeners dance all night long.  <br />The wailing sirens and the subtle guitars of the opener song, \\"A Pain That I'm used to\\" as for the single \\"Precious\\", is a more radio-friendly track, that appeals to the average listener. \\"Precious\\" is a ballad which is among one of David Gahan's song- writing contribution. In the early 90's, a lot of us enjoyed the pump up balled \\"Policy of Truth to \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" an orchestral/ choir sound with modest Motown signature.  <br /> <br />The biggest disappointment is to the soaring chorus of a six-minute closing track \\"The Darkest Star\\".  After listening to \\"The Sinner In Me\\" due to the dark tunes that fade and slows down for a few seconds gave me chills to the spine. However, the song beats pick up again with an addictive guitar riff, thumping faster andharder bringing the song to a climax ending. <br />Furthermore, all these powerful ballads capture Martin Gore's ear for a melody and wonderful lyris. The amazing part is the heart that David Gahan's ability to sing so sexy in these powerful songs. Listening to David Gahan's vocals give the songs a tender tune that makes all fans melt. Although, all the extra beats in the songs make them sound more beautiful, smooth, and pessimistic.  <br />Personally, Depeche Mode has great influence but will not gain too much audience. DM most popularity was in the new-wave era which was the mid 80's, is where Currently there is too much competition especially with a the new Genre coming out. Depeche Mode is one of thegreatest comeback new wavegroups that I ever known.  <br />Depeche Mode will launch a world tour in support of the album \\"Playing the Angel\\" starting in October. Depeche Mode gave Chicagoans an awesome concert that was unforgettable. <br />
B00000342V|5.0|This album is a true classic.  Curtis Mayfieldis a musical genius.  This soundtrack is a great compilation of songs that were included in the movie.  If you are a fan of funk music and you do not have this album in your collection, go buy it, even if it is used, buy it.  It is so good, you will not be disappointed.
076790592X|5.0|\\"Sometimes you cannot believe what you see.  You have to believe what you feel, and if you are ever going to have people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too - even when you're in the dark, even when you're falling (pg. 21)\\".  Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom deserves five stars.  This book is a biography documentary of Mitch's conversation recordings, capturing Morrie's warmth and mentoring moments.  They both talked about their past life situations such as regret, death, family, emotions, aging, money, love, marriage, culture, and forgiveness.  The benefit of this book is learning Morrie's explanations of life that helped Mitch to restore his relationship with his brother Peter.  \\"Do the things that you are always concerned about really matter (pg.30)?\\"   The down side is not getting to know more regarding Mitch's wife as a person.  However, as young adults we can find an interest and value in this book to guide us into a positive bright future.  <br />Morrie's deadly disease (ALS) did not impair his intellectual reasoning, because he helped Mitch to attempt to reestablish a relationship with his brother, Peter.  According to Morrie, \\"....to trust someone, we need to close our eyes and fallback, hoping that the person will catch us and keep us from falling (pg. 23).\\"   Mitch and I as well learn from Morrie, that everyone in life, to some degree, needs other people to survive.   Despite his furious dependence and refusal of help, Peter also needs the love of friends and family to survive his illness, cancer.   Peter gives in after realizing Mitch is persistent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The minor deception about the book is the brief description of Janine, Mitch's wife.  Although she was not involved too much with Morrie, there was an opportunity to know her more when she sang to Morrie.  Even though Mitch married Janine, why did he choose to work rather than to create incredible moments together?  What type of appeal did Janinelack of that made her not to interested to Mitch? <br />This book brings an appeal to young adults because as we grow older we always learn from others.  The chapters in the book describe how Mitch changed his life, how it can attract us to do the same, to become a better person.  Occasionally, we work too much overtime to gain more materialistic things, but sometimes the simple things are worth millions more than an empty 40-bedroom mansion we have acquired. <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is full of reasoning, guidance and thoughts. Morrie will help all humans to accept death by being patience and having courage.  In Morrie's childhood, he was deprived of love and attention, and now that he is once again reliant on others as he was in his infancy, he thrives on the love and physical affection provided by his friends and family.  The lesson in this book is learning how love helps and makes opportunities to renew our lives. <br />
B000002572|5.0|Unless you live in a cave, if you are over thirty and follow rock, you are surely quite familiar with Boston's self titled debut album (1976). With over seventeen million copies sold since its release, every song on the album is a staple on any given classic rock station. \\"Boston\\" stands as the epitome of 70s AOR rock.<br /><br />The greatness of the band's sound stems from Tom Scholz's innovative guitar work, Brad Delp's signature harmonies, and of course, great, great songs.<br /><br />Scholz, an inventor and a graduate of MIT with a degree in mechanical engineering was a self-taught guitarist. He built-upon the vocabulary established by Hendrix and Clapton, but eschewed all traces of the blues. Scholz relied upon sci-fi effects and the organ to round out the sound. It would be easy for a technical wizard to go overkill with the effects, but Scholz knows when enough is enough and that less is more.<br /><br />As technically gifted as Scholz is, the album wouldn't be half as great as it is without vocalist Brad Delp. His unique smooth harmonies give the songs melody and make them lush.<br /><br />Barry Goudreau, (guitar) Sib Hashian, (drums) and Fran Sheehan (bass) round out the band. Although how much they actually contributed to both the writing of the songs and the recording of the album is disputed.<br /><br />There is a reason that every song on this album is a staple on any given classic rock station. The songs all have great riffs, melody, color, and are intriguing. With its innovative guitar work, special effects, and organ solos, the album boarders prog-rock territory, but the songs are also crafted to be radio-friendly, so everything is easily palatable.<br /><br />Somewhere between the hard-rocking classic Aerosmith and Van Halen, and the power-pop of Journey and Foreigner, lay Boston. Fans of 70s metal like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, etc, may be turned off by the album's commercial, radio-friendly sound, and write the band off as \\"corporate pap,\\" but they would be missing out. As commercial as this album is, the songs are just too good to write off.<br /><br />The album's intelligent lyrics are also an asset of the album that shouldn't be overlooked. They're not really deep, or profound, but they are thoughtful. Some songs deal with universal themes. Especially \\"Piece of Mind,\\" which tackles the reasons for existence and questions the value of competition. \\"More than a Feeling\\" tries to explain the unexplainable, what it is about the things we value that make them so important. Other songs, like \\"Smokin'\\" and \\"Something about You\\" haven't aged as well and sound dated. Relics form a bygone era they may be, they are still great songs.<br /><br />Although Boston would go on to release several follow-up albums, the debut remains, by far, their best work.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|On reviewing the CD and DVD Celtic Woman I must say that I have had the privelege of seeing the show live in Milwaukee, WI on  the shows 2005 Tour.  The show is one of the BEST I have ever seen! It is engaging, mesmorizing, beautiful and romantic. David Downes arrangements are haunting and enchanting. The women's  voices are like that of the Sirens in Greek lore, but with a far better result on your ears and life.  And the great fiddler  floats across the stage like an Irish fairy working her magic on all who look upon  her and listen. In my humble opinion, the CD  and DVD capture very well the magic of that night. I still use the music of the CD to quiet my soul on those busy days.  Oh, to find a woman like those of the Celtic Woman and to be filled with her talent and beauty and charm all the days of my life. Bravo, to the entire cast of Celtic Woman!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|After watching this film, the viewer will no doubt feel as one does when one awakens from a nightmare. One scene cuts into the next with no apparent logic linking them together. Perhaps it's not as important to decode the mystery as it is to become attentive to mood and atmosphere. Light and dark play a key role in the movie, as does the eerie, impressionistic music. However, there is more darkness in Mulholland than there is light, and the movie ultimately becomes the unfolding of a nightmare, the dark, incongruous side of a mind driven by something sinister.    Naomi Watts plays the role of Betty beautifully, and Laura Harring's performance as the sultry Rita is excellent. It's too bad, though, that in the scene in which Rita is supposed to appear fully nude, her pubic region is optically censored: instead of seeing Rita's pubic hair, the viewer sees a blur in that area. One is reminded of those annoying nudity-obscuring mosaic patterns often seen on television. If anything is truly out of place in this movie, it's this ludicrous censorship. In an interview posted online, the director said that he had deliberately blurred Rita's bush out of concern that pictures of the actress au naturel would appear all over the Internet. How inane. Why do a nude scene in the first place? One star is deducted for stupidity. Nevertheless, Watts and Harring's love scenes, though brief, are very much erotic.     The DVD picture is crisp and provides great color contrast; the audio is clean, delivering good sonic detail in the music of Angelo Badalamenti. There are no chapters in this DVD, apparently because the movie is meant to be viewed from beginning to end without any breaks.
0307276902|3.0|I bought the book early in it's publishing life because of the rave reviews. It describes well a part of life that a fortunate few of us have experienced.  The dentist office scene was far too vivid.  I felt the pain.  But, alas, I did not finish the book.  I laid it aside half-read and never picked it up again.  I felt no connection to the author/character for reasons that I have difficulty explaining.  Maybe it's because the author had so little connection to himself that I shared his disinterest in finding a full life for him.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|I like System. I like their debut, love Toxicity, thought Steal This Album possessed some shining moments, and really enjoyed Mezmorize, which is still getting regular rotation in my player. Thus I come to Hypnotize, a cd that leaves me with mixed emotions. One thing is for certain, a quote I read by Malakian saying \\"I can get a lot crazier if I want to\\" proved to be a prophecy, as this cd takes System's trademark eclectic sound and progresses to the next level. I have listened to this cd 4 times through, and can label each with a certain feeling. 1: What is this? This is terrible!! 2: Well, I was a little harsh, maybe it just needs more listens to grow on me? 3: Oh now I get it, this is great! 4: Ok, this is decent, but its wearing on me fast. Thus I feel I can write a review \\"personal opinion for those that take these personally\\". Each System in the past seems to have a certain formula, which basically includes a number of songs that are easily accessible and radio friendly for what they play, such as Spiders, Chop Suey, Toxicity, and so on. Other tracks, whose names currently elude me and I apologize, are so far out there that only there that only a select number of people can truly appreciate their value. Mezmorize and Hypnotize seem to have taken on opposite aspects of that formula. With Mezmorize, you had a number of short tracks that though maintaining that System sound, were made in an easily listenable fashion. Mezmorize only required one listen, and you knew whether or not you liked it, at least in my case. Hypnotize on the other hand is all over the map, as though Malankian was given free reign over the entire process, and the result is a cd that takes numerous listens to uncover the various layers of noise in order to reach the basic underlying song. I could list each song in detail, but Im not out to convince you of anything, just state my thoughts. Suffice it to say, after my fourth listen I found myself trying to truly enjoy this cd, but unable to. Though not bad by any means, when compared to their other works I find it a little too extreme. Experimenation is wonderful, but hopefully they will return a tad bit to the more controled aspect of their sound that makes it an enjoyable experience for me. Thanks for reading.
4883191028|5.0|This textbook treats you like an adult who needs to speak in Japan. Each lesson introduces a few sentence patterns (i.e. grammar), gives relevant vocabulary, shows how to use it in useful situations, and provides lots of opportunity for practice.  <br />The vocabulary is excellent. It is aggressive: it requires us to learn about 50 new words per lesson, and reuses the vocab from previous lessons. It is also well chosen: the vocab logically matches the sentence patterns for that lesson so that we can learn and practice them together. But it doesn't ask us to memorize exhaustive themed categories (animals, etc...). It recognizes that many adults need to talk about \\"reports\\" more often than \\"horses\\". <br />Minna No Nihongo uses a lot of pairwork, and I have found it most effective studying in a class with a teacher or at least with a dedicated partner.  <br />The book itself is unique. I've never seen another like it. It is written for foreigners in Japan so it is written completely in japanese. Then students can buy the accompanying translation and grammatical notes (recommended) in the language of their choice (English, Korean, Chinese, etc.).
B000B7BRMM|5.0|This is a great CD. Diana Krall ads her personal touch to all the christmas favorites. They are groovy and jazzy. You can't help but feel a bit cooler when listening to this.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|After hearing the first two studio cuts on iTunes, I was hyped that this album would encompass 7-8 tracks of hard blues similar to his \\"Why Don't You Come When I Call\\" track with the addition of \\"Something's Missing\\" and \\"Daughters\\".  The end result is not that, but that is not to say the record itself is not a great representation of the live show and a showcase for Mayer's skills.  I'm not sure the many critics on this album appreciate the level of guitar work that is done here and how clean it comes out LIVE.  Detractors will say it's not SRV, well, no kidding.  But have you heard a better version of Jimi's \\"Wait For Tomorrow\\" until this?  The guitar work is spot on (again, especially live) and the solo rips harder than all others.  It seems blues 'aficionados' will discount Mayers chops as \\"too clean\\" and \\"too fast\\", but isn't that more entertaining to listen to and appreciate than BB King who plays one note and self-professed can strum a single chord?  Again, some people may have built this up to be the next \\"SRV-In The Beginning\\", but it's not.  It's a fine album of some straight up blues tunes, some blues-hybrids and some clever redos of both Mayer covers along with Jimi and Ray Charles.  And let's not forget, the first time that SRV played to the establishment in Montreaux, he was booed off stage.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It's like an explanation of what has been going on her life. Awesome music. She has such a great sound! Filled with hits.
0307276902|5.0|first of all, i want to address a couple of other reviews here.  it's true that james went it alone in his recovery in this book, but i'd like to point out that he did what worked, FOR HIM.  he ignored what wouldn't help him.  that's the smartest thing anyone can ever do.  the 12 steps and AA would have never worked for him and he knew it.  this book will really make you question the effectiveness of AA.  after all, this book chronicles the best clinic in THE WORLD, and what is their treatment rate?  a whopping 15%!!!  wow.  AA says in the same breath \\"addiction is a disease.  you can't resist the temptation.  you will always be an addict your whole life.\\"  they say you can't do anything about your addiction, and then they try to make you do something about it!  what???  it makes no sense whatsoever.  james frey has it right - addiction is a simple choice.  you either say yes i'll do this drug, or no i won't.  however you get to that point (through AA or some other way), it comes down to a simple choice.  you can choose to go to that bar, talk to that friend, or not.  as james says, cancer is a disease.  you don't choose to get cancer.  you do choose whether to use a drug, even if it's extremely hard not to.     anyway, this was a great book.  i read it in 3 days, all 400+ pages.  the writing style is very addicting to read.  yes, james has a selfish, rude attitude.  so what?  he's refreshingly honest and real.  he DOES remember the people who helped him in rehab.  he does care about other people.  but he doesn't accept any BS.  he DOES have humility.  he accepts that he is a pathetic drug addict who has wasted his life, and he does something about it.    i'm really surprised oprah liked this book.  don't let that fool you.  this book is like a punch to the face.  there's nothing fake about it.  some people are saying this book is whiny like that horrible book \\"a heartbreaking work of staggering genius\\" or something.  WRONG.  it's nothing like that.  james frey is so cool, he's practically a superhero.  he's a real man, not a wimp.  also i'd like to point out that if you think james is a jerk, you should read what OTHER addicts are like!  what, you think they're pleasant people to be around??  they're ALL jerks!  these are people who abandon their friends and family and use them, all for their own selfish addiction.  alcoholics and drug addicts ALL put their families and children through hell.  they are not nice, friendly people.  anyway, great book... i didn't want it to end.  and when it does, there's something shocking at the end, so be sure to read it all.   an incredibly genuine and honest look at the horrors of drug addiction.      EDIT - this review is pretty funny after the oprah show, huh?  :P  oh well, that me and many others thought frey was genuine does highlight his writing talent :D

B00000IPAX|5.0|This is a great CD that has some very classic songs. Songs like Going Away to Colledge, Anthem Part 1, and Story of a Lonely Guy are perfect. But my favorite is Adams Song; it was a complete change for the group who usually did very up beat fast songs that were about love dating and high school. It caught allot of people by surprise when it first came out. It also has some of the first Blink songs I ever heard that introduced me to my favorite band, and punk in general.
B00005JOGU|5.0|\\"Until one morning in mid-November of 1959, few Americans - in fact, few Kansans - had ever heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of a river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there.\\" (from In Cold Blood)    Truman Capote invented the \\"non-fiction novel\\" with words like those.  The small town in Kansas would gain national fame when two vagabond criminals murdered a Rockwellian family of four, blasting shotgun pellets into their faces at close range and splattering blood onto perfectly made beds and floors that seemed to be washed daily.  The film \\"Capote\\" tells of the writer's immediate fascination with the consequences of such an act on a conservative buttoned-down town and his eventual relationship with the killers who stole Kansas' innocence.        Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the enigmatic writer and the pursuit that would haunt the rest of his days.  Those unfamiliar with the writer will get a crash course in who he was, his homosexuality, his drinking, his odd presentation and speaking.  But more importantly, all viewers will see how the killings in Kansas and their consequences would virtually end his writing career, as \\"In Cold Blood\\" was the only book he published in the last two decades of his life.      In the film, Capote connects with the killers, as he sees the world divided into two categories: those like the church-going, milk drinking, \\"yes ma'am\\" saying murder victims and the rest of the world, the outsiders.  He and the killers belong to the latter group, and only a fine line exists between them.  \\"It's as if we were bothers, and one day he went out the back door while I went out the front,\\" Capote says of Perry Smith, the man who slit the throat of the family patriarch.    Just as Capote faced ridicule and judgment all his life because of his eccentricity, so did the killers.   Thus, a bond.      His initial quest for a story leads him on a conflicting journey, as he is torn between his duties as a literary journalist and the love he develops for his new \\"brothers\\".   As his relationship with Smith deepens, Capote wishes to fully understand the murderer and include his humanity in the book, so that the world won't forever think of him as a monster.    But the more he tries to whitewash through understanding, the bloodier his friend's hands become.      Capote does not want the men to die, and the film certainly has anti-death penalty aspirations.  But it does not develop them irresponsibly.  The killers are not romanticized (a la Monster) and the people who support that act are not sadistic fire-breathers (Dead Man Walking).  The death penalty is shown for what it is: a brutal act brought about by the actions of horrible people.        Hollywood is in the middle of a Renaissance with biographies and \\"Capote\\" shows them all how less is more.  So many films try to reduce a person's life to a few hours, an impossible task.  \\"Capote\\" instead trusts the audience to grasp the totality of the man by focusing on the most important episode in his life.  Audiences will come away from this film knowing as much about the essence of Truman Capote as is learned about Howard Hughes, Ray Charles or Johnny Cash in recent films of their lives.  But unlike the other three, \\"Capote\\" does not suffer from a disjointed, meandering narrative.  The focus instead is on one event, and the result is a biopic against which all others should be measured.

0345452585|3.0|\\"The Conspiracy club\\" is told through the eyes of Jeremy Carrier, a psychologist at City Central Hospital.  Throughout the story Jeremy tries to come to terms with the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Jocelyn. Other murders in the area occur in the same fashion and it's apparent that a serial killer is responsible.  Although, Jeremy is a primary suspect for the murders and is harrassed by the police, he begins to investigate the murders himself to find the killer.  He begins  a friendship with the eccentric Dr. Chess, who is himself interested in the causes of bad behavior and evil.<br /><br />I found my first book by Kellerman to be entertaining,but has a depressing tone throughout and contains characters that seem a little one dimensional. Still at times, Kellerman seems extremely insightful in his descriptions of human interaction.  I plan on checking out some more books by this author.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|The title of this review says it all.  A number of reviewers are certainly very excited by this \\"new sound\\".  Little do they mention or even realised that The Matrix helped to co-produce the album.  If you read the interviews, Korn was glad to have the extra musicans (from The Matrix of course) to produce the album.  Don't get me wrong.  The Matrix is talented.  They have done well in Avril's first album.  And did relatively fine with Liz Phair's previous album.  But commercial pop arena is where they should stay. <br /> <br />To me, Korn is about the sound of rawness - the guitar tracks from the left and right channel (now one guitarist is gone), the distorted bass, the vocal at times with effects, and the refreshing drumming.  And it is the consistency of such a wonderful combination from first to the last track of the album that thrills me. <br /> <br />I love to listen to Korn's music with my eyes closed and totally absorbed into the wonderful riff.  In this album, it is very disconnected.  There are differences in every song and of course it may be appeal to some.  But to me, that is a set back.  Somehow, electric sound and Korn just doesn't mix.  And in this album, the beautiful memorable riff is just not there.  Even the bass line that I come to love so much about Korn is not there anymore. <br /> <br />So, I have concluded that the guitarist who has left Korn was indeed the soul of Korn.  All the Korn characteristics are now gone (of course you can always look at it as a \\"new sound\\").  The most irritating and disappointing thing about this new album is that the energy level is just not there anymore.  Yes, the album can be loud at times but the energy level of the song is not there.  Even the melody of the song is not inspiring anymore.  My take is try sample the songs first and decide for yourself if you really want to get that.  I am a hardcore Korn fan and I am not going to buy this album.  If you manage to like this new Korn (they really should rename the band), I am happy for you.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Last year, KoRn released their \\"Greatest Hits\\" so they could end their contract with Sony. Then, their very influential guitarist, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, left the band as he became a born again Christian. Throughout the last year, he has not really said too much that is positive about KoRn, and has been an overall jerk about the whole thing. However, KoRn is moving on without Head. They just released their 7th album, \\"See You On the Other Side.\\"<br /><br />  Over the years, the biggest criticism that KoRn has received that almost all of their albums sound, essentially, the same. Their last album, \\"Take a Look in the Mirror,\\" although my personal favorite, had a lukewarm response. One half enjoyed the return to the sound of their first album. The other felt that the band had ran its course on this very sound.<br /><br />  So, KoRn has responded with a new direction with \\"See You On the Other Side.\\" Rather than completely abandoning their sound and alienating the fans, they have taken the KoRn sound, and stretched it to its fullest potential. For me, it was quite jarring and an adjustment at the first listen. However, in the end, I am very glad KoRn went in this direction.<br /><br />1. Twisted Transistor (10/10) - Their first single off of the album has been a smash hit for KoRn. I have no other way of describing it as \\"KoRn meets Talking Heads.\\" It definitely has that 80s Alternative/Punk/Techno feel to it. Twisted Transistor is a very catchy track with some rather ironic lyrics. The song is about the moment we all have with the radio. We are upset about something, and then we turn on the radio. That song just happened to fit your situation and defines you for that very moment.<br /><br />2. Politics (11/10) - Wow! This particular track sort of takes your classic \\"Here to Stay\\" or \\"Counting On Me\\"-type KoRn song and adds a \\"richer\\" sound to it, as one of my co-workers had described. I keep on trying to be descriptive as I can on this song, but I end up sounding really stupid. So, I will just let the 11 speak for itself.<br /><br />3. Hypocrites (10/10) - This uses what KoRn hasn't used since Follow the Leader....HIP HOP ELEMENTS. Jon semi-raps through the chorus, \\"Pay the merry man, pay the f----- driver. Pay the preachers and pay the f------ liars.\\" It is a great song that is already getting played live.<br /><br />4. Souvenir (9/10) - This is one of the more powerful tracks on the CD, especially relating to the lyrics.<br /><br />5. 10 or a 2-Way (8/10) - This is KoRn's attempt at a \\"Sexy Tongue-In-Cheek Song\\" so to speak. It is a good song, but I find the song more categorized \\"Dark Humor rather than \\"Tongue-In-Cheek.\\".All of it is evident in the lyric, \\"I'm only f------- you till the season change \\"<br /><br />6. Throw Me Away (7/10) - I may have been soured on this song because it was on an EP that was released earlier, and I was very thrown off by the whole thing. However, I have given it a second chance and it is a decent song. However, it seems like one of the filler tracks off of Untouchables or Issues.<br /><br />7. Love Song (11/10) - This song has a very epic feel to it and I feel like I have walked into the Church of Metal when I listen to this track.<br /><br />8. Open Up (10/10) - I swear in the middle, JD is either humming or something weird going on there. Whatever it is, I dig it.<br /><br />9. Coming Undone (9/10) - I like this song, but it just falls short of totally awesome, and I am not sure why.<br /><br />10. Getting Off (8/10) - This one seems a bit repetitive after \\"Coming Undone.\\" The chorus for Coming Done frequently used the phrase, \\"I'm Coming Undone.\\" Then, this song's chorus is \\"I'm Getting Off.\\" However, if you single this track out without listening to the first nine tracks, it is worthy of an eight out of ten!<br /><br />11. Liar (9/10) - Can you say \\"JD's Scat AND Bagpipes?\\" I thought you could! Good stuff!<br /><br />12. For No One (10/10) - This has a very nice beat to it.<br /><br />13. I'veSeen It All (9/10) - It is a good song.<br /><br />14. Tearjerker (Saturated Lonliness) (11/10) - Wow...in the end, that is all anybody has to say about Tearjerker. KoRn is always known for putting its most tortured track of the entire album as the last track. This one is especially worthy of the last track\\" This track is very eerie and goes on with this feeling that this is all a big epic story with a sad ending. In the end, you do produce a couple of tears in your eye (hence, the name, Tearjerker)<br /><br />Bonus Disc:<br /><br />1. Its Me Again (10/10) - I love original songs as bonus tracks! This is a very good song that could be worthy of an album. My personal feeling is that it probably just didn't fit within the whole concept of this experimental album.  However, the chorus is great (Where you see beauty, I see pain. Where you see skies, I see acid rain!)<br /><br />2. Eaten Up Inside (8/0) - This is another good bonus track. You can't argue with original songs as bonus tracks as opposed to just remixes/live songs.<br /><br />3. Last Legal Drug (La Petite Mort) (9/10) - See Eaten Up Inside<br /><br />4. Twisted Transistor - Dante Ross Remix - I am the first person to say that I am not a remix person. I hate it when bands release remix CDs. They should only be B-sides, or in this case, a bonus track. However, I am going to have to give a \\"Yay!\\" to this remix. It is actually ::gasps:: a good take on a great song!<br /><br />5. Twisted Transistor - Dummies Club Mix - I am not a remix person. I am the first to admit that before anybody. This one clocks in at 7 minutes, which is way too long for a chopped up version of a song I've already heard several times. It is also pretty monotonous from where I stand.<br /><br />In the end, you are going to see either people love or hate this album. So you are going to see on Amazon here, either 1 star or 5 stars reviews for the album. My best suggestion is to keep an open mind and listen to it more than once before you make a snap judgement.ery nice beat to it. <br /> <br />13.

B0000027RL|5.0|I was 25 when 10 came out. I wasn't a grunge fan but I knew great music and lyrics when I heard them. I'm 40 now and I still know great music and I still consider 10 to be one of the top 5 greatest, defining albums of all time! I hate to be repetative but \\"Black\\" is probably the greatest \\"somebody done somebody wron song\\" ever written...period! Anyone who has ever loved and lost and then searched vain to somehow articulate the torrential fallout of grief and pain that always comes from saying goodbye, need look no further than the lyrics from Black to speak for them. It reaches into your soul and gives the reasurrance that you are not alone, that everbody hurts and that knowledge helps you make it through.  <br /> <br />And as for Eddy Vedder, not only does he have a voice that transcends age or gender (my 5 year old son loves evenflow and my 2 year old daugter falls into peacfull sleep whenever \\"Release\\" is playing) but he gives voice to emotion drawing creativity from his own painful past and spinning it into sonic \\"Nirvana\\". <br /> <br />Buy \\"10\\" pop it into your cd player and soon names like Cobain and Nirvana will be but distant memories lost in the anals of mediocre music.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|First things first: the Korn you knew in Jr. high is gone. They were already coming dangerously close to committing artistic suicide with \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\", which was lukewarm and derivitive and tried way too hard. My feelings towards that album have softened a bit over the years, but I still couldn't help thinking that maybe Korn were done for.<br /><br />Well, in a way, they were. \\"Mirror\\" was the old Korn's death cry, and when Brian Welch left the band, the final nail was hammered into the coffin. However a lineup change and a label change seem to have conspired to create something that is, if nothing else, creative and new.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the propulsive, but melodically challanged, \\"Twisted Transistor.\\" While deffinitly not my favorite song on this album, it is representative of the changes to Korn's sound. At first listen, this album reminded me of Orgy. Indeed it borrows heavily from the softcore industrial sounds of Nine Inch Nails, Orgy, Static-X, et al, as well from one of their stated influences, Ministry. Even when there are no electronics in the mix, the aggressive pulse in most of these songs still bring to mind industrial music.<br /><br />The band also seems to have discarded the impressionistic chords and rich wall-of-sound textures in favor of a more horizontal approach. No doubt this is a result of Head leaving the band - without another guitarist to bounce ideas off of, James Shaffer's guitar parts reflect a thrashier sensability. The low-tuned guitars in many cases have lost their bass-y deffinition and now act as an abrasive noise texture. Fieldy's bass lines no longer seem to double as percussion parts and he is more taken to using the fuzz pedal.<br /><br />...and \\"evolution of heavy\\" indeed. Whatever that means, it seems to be a coordinated marketing gimmick of some kind - in addition to the amazon review for this album, that transparent phrase can be found on a sticker on the cellophane package of the cd itself as well. Don't be fooled into thinking this is some kind of blistering death rock record... it's just about the least-heavy thing Korn has put out. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think Jonathan Davis has burned out the tempertantrums that fueled his mysogenistic rage on earlier albums, and any attempt to recapture that kind of sound would come off as forced and cheesey.<br /><br />Starting with the disappointing but still listenable \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" the album steadily gets better every song. \\"Hypocrites\\" is a relatively more traditional heavy/aggressive song with a southern-fried guitar riff a bit remiscent of Pantera or Down. \\"Souvenier\\" is interesting mostly because it sees Korn experimenting with time changes, something that has almost never factored into Korn's pop-oriented song structures.<br /><br />Then we come to what I consider to be the first real highlight of the album - \\"10 or a 2-way.\\" It begins as a raunchy Marilyn Manson-esque cabaret rocker... but then the chorus rolls around and knocks your head off with unanticipated heavyness. It's all the more effect because the album as a whole isn't that heavy; so when it's heavy, it really stands out.<br /><br />Another highlight (and this album sees more and more of them as it goes on) is the meloncholy \\"Throw Me Away\\" which reminds me of the Untouchables record with its wealth of sentimental ballad stand-ins. And that's a good thing. Other highlights include the funky, tuneful \\"Open Up,\\" a Static-X-esque sing-along called \\"Liars,\\" and in my opinion the crowning achievement of this album, \\"Seen It All.\\" The last track mentioned is a supremely creepy and dramatic song that reminds me of Angel Dust-era Faith No More. It is more than worthy of Korn's closing track.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it isn't the closing track. The actual closing track is a quiet, haunting sort of psuedo-ballad called \\"Tearjerker.\\" The dumb title belies its subtleties, but even then its more of an afterthought to \\"Seen It All\\" which is the kind of last impression Korn SHOULD be trying to make.<br /><br />Most of the other songs are pretty good, although a few of them like \\"Politics\\" and \\"Getting Off\\" get a little boring after awhile. There are no appallingly horrible tracks (which is more than can be said about Take a Look in the Mirror) and the highlights are in abundance.<br /><br />Unfortunately for those who were looking for a nostalgia fix to remind them of their jr. high days, Korn have given up trying to rip themselves off. But luckily for those who are ready to move on, 'Other Side' shows that Korn still know how to make NEW music. This album is as creative and different as anything this band has ever done. Korn may never put out another Issues or self-titled or Follow the Leader, but by continuing to develop and change, they have avoided going down with the nu metal ship they themselves helped build.

0553801503|5.0|Okay....we all know what's missing.  That being said, this book is still a part of the best series ever written in modern fantasy, and any comparisons to Jordan are ridiculous.  Martin serves up his story with such artistry, and every detail matters.  If you don't see that, you either neglected to read the other three books, or you are in junior high school (or reading at a junior high level).      Jordan's books, of which I have read five, are full of useless details and annoying character traits (e.g. the braid pulling).  How many times can you give the \\"Dragon Reborn\\" a \\"whithering look\\" and it have the same effect?  Most of Jordans details, while painting a very colorful world, do nothing for the story, and some are just downright annoying.  Martin hides morsels of importance and intrigue in every sentence.  Is the Hound really dead...read carefully...is Pate, like the pig boy, really Pate at the end...read carefully...There is so much foreshadowing, symbolism, and intelligence built into this story, you could literally teach a semester long college course on each book...including Feast.    Usually I read books to get to the end, but with ASOIAF, I read every page slowly, hungrily, and with an anticipation I've never known before.  I can't wait for the story to continue either, but to downgrade this work of art because the story is not yet complete is a very childish and rash thing to do.  Anyone with an ounce of adult intelligence will see what I mean.  Hooray for Feast!  Bring on the Dragons!!!
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Like many Korn fans, I have much to say about this new album. But before I do, I would like to start with a brief history of the relationship between the fans and Korn. In Korn's first two albums (Korn, Life Is Peachy), they had managed to create a strong underground fan base that would eat, drink, breathe, and bleed Korn. However, with the release of Follow The Leader, there seemed to be some controversy brewing. Some fans blamed them for going soft, (completely unwarranted) but more importantly, the main stream attention Korn started receiving (i.e. MTV) made many of the underground fans nervous. With this new found success, many of the underground fans started drowning in the influx of newbies, and almost two minutes later, Korn released their fourth album Issues. With so much hype built up behind it in such a short period of time, there was no place to hide for those endangered underground fans. Many would perish under the enormous weight of popularity.<br /><br />Issues proved to be the first in a series of major changes in Korn's sound. With Jonathan Davis' emphasis on singing more than screaming the allegations of them going soft weren't so far fetched this time. The next two albums came after a slight cooling period in the world of Korn fans, and after Untouchables and Take A Look In The Mirror (Korn's unsuccessful attempt at redemption), it seemed as though there was a definate lull in the band's success.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into this doomsday scenario however, because when the going gets tough, the tough get reckless. In this unprecedented turn of events (also known as their seventh album, See You On The Other Side), Korn have opted to take out much of the raw energy and pounding guitars, and replace it with a more industrial, almost electronic feel. One can only speculate as to why the now four members of Korn decided to go this rout. Perhaps an attempt to jump start their sagging record sales? Could it have something to do with the absence of their second guitarist, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch? Maybe the Nine Inch Nails influenced production team played a part. Whatever the case may be, the fact of the matter is that those same fans who claimed Korn went soft with Follow The Leader and Issues are probably dying a thousand deaths with his one. However controversial, you must give credit where credit is due. Korn would be fooling themselves if they thought they were going to please all their fans with this album. Instead, they decided to go in the opposite direction and seemingly please themselves rather than the majority of their fans. This album seems to be the answer to all the fans turned haters. It seems to be saying, you think we went soft before? Try this one on for size!<br /><br />Now when you listen to See You On The Other Side it may be beneficial to put aside the last 10 years and focus on the present. If you're able to do that I think you will find a rather interesting and diverse album. The only problem with this industrial feel is that they seem to be treading a little too close to Nine Inch Nails terretory. If fans wanted an industrial album, they'd be better off just buying  a Nine Inch Nails album. There are some touches however that are definitive Korn; child oriented cover art, the use of \\"scat\\", and Davis' bagpipe playing interludes. The first few songs sound most like the Korn of old, with \\"Hypocrites\\" shining through as the head banging hit of the bunch. The most melodic and industrial laced songs come toward the middle of the album, with songs like \\"Throw Me Away\\" and \\"Open Up.\\" The oddest and most confused sounding song is \\"Love Song,\\" which has riffs reflecting a minor key, with a major key harmony slapped on top for the chorus. \\"Liar\\" and \\"For No One\\" bring us back down to earth again with heavy riffs and singing which reflects the days of Issues. The last song on this album is titled \\"Tearjerker,\\" but it is not the sort of tear-jerking closing track we have come accustomed to with the firsttwo albums. It is a slow and lamenting song with high pitched singing that almost sounds unnatural coming from someone capable of such monstrous growls.<br /><br />With as much as this band has gone through, to say that they will suffer from such a dramatic change is completely untrue. The members of Korn are a resilient bunch, and even through losing half of their guitar force they've managed to evolve, no, mutate into an interestingly diverse sounding band. Granted, this new industrial edge may be hard for some fans to swallow, but keep in mind that Korn can never be the same band they were in 1994, and I don't think we would want them to be.w and lamenting song with high pitched singing that almost sounds unnatural coming from someone capable of such monstrous growls.

B000BVD460|3.0|When I first heard Eminem, I was immature. Thats probably why I dug his first two cds. The Marshal Mathers LP is probably one of the finest rap cds out there. He grew up, started to mature, and so did I. The way that I am was is a good song, but he basically made every single song after that a sappy song. Unless it was his first single off the cd and it was a generic copy of the last first single he did. I boycotted Eminem for about a year now, due to his disappointing last cd. Plus he is running low on ideas. I understand he's older and a dad, so maybe he'll go away for awhile and raise Haley. His new song is alright, although its sappy. Thanks Em for the great music, take a nice, long vaction.

B000BMSTMS|2.0|this is their most disappointing work yet.  Take a look in the mirror was the beginning of this downward spiral.  Sad to see them go.
0553801503|2.0|I am a huge fan of the previous three novels in this series.  Unlike many books that I have read, the Song of Ice and Fire novels have developed the characters and showed how those personalities interract to create a challenging life for these characters.  The Feast for Crows continues this difficult writing feat, but the story has moved in a disappointing direction from what I had been looking forward to for years.    The narrative that I have been reading and anticipating is a story about the Stark family's rivalry with the Lannister family which leads to them losing everything, and (presumably) reagaining it slowly over the course of the writings.  This occurs under a backdrop of the rebirth of dragons and potential invasion of \\"the others\\".  Both of which should take priority over petty inter-family squabbles, but (of course) does not.    This novel veered off in a completely different direction -- the Starks, the dragons, and the wights were barely mentioned.  The Feast for Crows is primarily a novel of the mostly failed attempts of the Ironborn and Dornishmen to conquor the kingdom, Cersei Lannister's descent into paranoia, Jaime Lannister's (failed) attempts to gain respect, and Brienne's failed attempts to find the Stark children.    This novel is filled with much that has made Martin a great writer.  His characters are three dimensional, and he can build tension when leading up to relatively mild events.  For instance, when Brienne is leading a small group to an abandoned ruin, she hopes to find a lead to one of the Stark children.  Instead, she uncovers outlaws and a swordfight.  The detail in the writing is exceptional, but -- so what.    In the prior novels, Martin would have had a bird or a spy inform of us the intrigue at Dorne or Pike.  In doing so, he accomplished the plot complexity with a simple paragraph. In Feast for Crows, we are subjected to major development of minor story lines at the expense of the more significant characters.  Martin apologizes for the lack of many of these characters in a letter at the end.  He would have been better served to eliminate Pike, eliminate Dorne, and reduce the Brienne POV (which is ultimately unsatisfying) -- thereby giving space to add the Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys, and Bran Stark story development.    Of note in this story is the development of the oldest Stark daugter, Sansa.  In her short, four chapters, she grows from an idealistic, shallow youth to a politically astute, hardened young lady.  When her mentor bargains for a year to prove his worth, she shrewdly realizes that his adversaries will be eliminated in that year.  It is telling that George R.R. Martin can accomplish this development in four chapters when Brienne takes three times that much to accomplish less.    In summary, whle the Cersei, Sansa, and Jaime POV chapters are fascinating, and the entire novel is vividly written, the book is frustratingly empty.  Most of the plot lines develop into failures, and many plot lines and characters from the previous novels are ignored.
055380457X|5.0|This is a very well-written and scrupulously well-researched account of the Google phenomenon.  A great story of how two incredibly bright guys with a great deal of perseverance changed the world.  It's filled with anecdotes and analysis that keep the reader intrigued from start to finish.  Before reading this book, I never really understood how Google made money. I do now.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a great read for themselves, or a great gift for a friend.  5 stars!
B000AA305M|5.0|I became aware of David Gray belatedly, when he went on Letterman to promote his 2000 release, WHITE LADDER.  I love that CD.  Later, when A NEW DAY AT MIDNIGHT came out, I bought it without first hearing it.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  Since then, I have probably listened to the WHITE LADDER CD three or four times for every time I have listened to A NEW DAY AT MIDNIGHT.  While it is a good enough CD, it just doesn't blow my socks off like WHITE LADDER.  Now, I have a new favorite.  Not just a new favorite of David Gray CDs, but a new favorite of all CDs.  As far as I am concerned, LIFE IN SLOW MOTION is the artist's masterpiece, thus far.  It has everything that is best about David Gray; meaningful, provocative lyrics, infectious melodies, original beat lines, and innovative uses of unusual instruments.  All that, without ever sounding contrived or forced.  I liked LIFE IN SLOW MOTION the first time I played it, and it just keeps getting better, every time I hear it.  It is a rare CD that I will listen to more than once in a row, but when this CD gets to the end, I keep hitting  the replay button.  I have already listened to it as many times as WHITE LADDER and A NEW DAY AT MIDNIGHT, combined, in the first few weeks I have had it.  My favorite track is \\"Ain't No Love,\\" which begins as a piano ballad, and somewhere in the middle develops a gospel sound (ironic, for a song that begins, \\"May be that it would do me good, If I believed there were a God, Out in the starry firmament, But as it is that's just a lie. . .\\"  But there isn't a single throwaway song on the whole CD.  The man's a genius, in a league with (though different genres than), say, Sting, or Stevie Wonder.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|This CD is a disgrace to the legandary blues singers of the past such as Ruth Brown, BB King, Buddy Guy, and John Lee Hooker. The fact that people buy this trash and call John a legend is a disgrace. Every song on this cd lacks any feeling or \\"blues.\\" Mato Nanji of Indigenous, John's peer is a much better performer and his music has more substance. I suggest that all blues fans check Indigenous out and leave John's trash right where it belongs, on the shelf collecting dust.

B000ANVQ0K|3.0|I would just like to know when the industry will start to wise up and include family-friendly edited versions of their movies on their deluxe DVD sets. \\"Titanic\\" was a great movie I would love to share with the young people in my life, except for the historically nonsensical and gratuitous nudity and the sex scene. Delete these and the whole family can enjoy this blockbuster together. Family-friendly editing businesses are now supplying the needs of this market, much to Hollywood's chagrin. Would that Hollywood could spot a trend and supply their own high-quality edited versions of their \\"PG-13\\"-rated films for families (as they do for airlines and network television). I would rather pay the original creators and producers for a sterling family-friendly version--but where is it?
B0002GTWYW|1.0|This guy was called B.I.G. and he should have been named BIG, FAT and UGLY!! Who would really find this enjoyable to listen to? Most all rap music is just the same beat, same rude lyrics, sung by black guys rubbing their crotches. Now that is really attractive, fellas!! <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, instead of buying this CD, go get yourself some real music, some R & B or maybe Motown. THAT is R.E.A.L., but this rap crap is a B.I.G. waste of money.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I too have been a KoRn fan since '94 or so when nobody knew who they were. I stumbled across their first self titled cd at Down In The Valley and the sound just amazed me. I had never heard anything like it. <br /> <br />I have listened to this new cd more then I have with the last two LPs. Very different yes, but no it doesn't sound all that much like  the first album, Life Is Peachy or Issues. I like it none the less. Bands continue to try and expand/experiment to bring new sounds and this is where KoRn succeded. Out of all the negatives said about KoRn the only thing I truly miss is the way Munky and Head sort of played off of one another in the first album. You could really hear two different guitar players more distinctly on that first piece of work. Even though they are now down to one guitarist the sound is still great. <br /> <br />Listen to the cd yourself before you give in to the negative reviews. Everyone has their own opinion on what is good or bad music but that doesn't mean a few negative reviews mean it is crap. I have stayed a fan of bands like KoRn and Manson even though they have changed so dramtically since their first albums. Make up your own mind on this one and let the negative reviewers listen to something else.

1844137864|5.0|Think art has lost its edge?  Witness the art of England's Banksy and reconsider.     His message: that if the powerful and wealthy get to force-feed consumerist propaganda to citizens via giant billboards... then citizens have the right to reply in kind.  To that end he's trekked around the world throwing up politically pointed, often funny, always eye-popping street art wherever he damn well pleases: On sidewalks, on train trestles, on the West Bank wall between Israel and Palestine, in monkey cages at the zoo, in the world's great museums (unbeknownst to the curators, of course), and on farm animals (yes, ON them).      \\"Wall and Piece\\" is a \\"best of\\" overview of Banksy's career, and impresses on a lot of levels.  There's the skill and variety of Banksy's techniques (stencils, illustrations, paintings, screenprints and sculptures are all on display).  There's the caustic wit of his writing (expressed here in almost epigrammatic blurbs about art and politics).  And there's his genius as a prankster.  Example: Not content merely to graffitti a blank wall in Westminster, Banksy instead throws up an official-looking \\"This Wall Is A Designated Graffitti Area\\" stencil (complete with a \\"royal\\" crest swiped off a pack of cigarettes)... and watches others do the work for him.      For those yearning for art that's active... that excites and inspires instead of merely placating... this is the book of the year.  One warning: it sits on your coffee table like a social land mine.  Guests come over, crack it open, and it obliterates conversation for a while as they get sucked in.  Completely Addictive.  Highly recommended.
B000B8QF14|3.0|I saw Green Day on the American Idiot tour in America last year. The boys where just as explosive their as they where at this show, but the atmosphere is not as emotional as it was when I saw them. This could be because American Idiot is America's album for rebellion. Im not saying that England doen't get it, but for the next DVD, go for a more emotional show, not a bigger crowd. <br />   My next complaint is the setlist. I think AI is a great album, but the songs are constantly on the radio, the videos are always on MTV, and I can't walk down Time Square with out seeing Billie Joe Armstrong on one the the big screens. I think for a live album, half the songs on the album is to many from one album. There is only one song from warning, Minority. Warning was a great album, and they barley play anything from it. <br />They do play some classics at the show, and some of those songs turn at well. Basket Case is amazing, Minority is great, Long View is also great, and Good Riddence is a great way to end the album. Hitchin a Ride should not be on the album because its only good if your their in person to watch it. The same goes for knowledge, but is only worth it to see it in person, and when you do, its a great part in the show. Brain Stew is nothing without Jaded, and Jaded is nothing with out Brain Stew, so Brain Stew doesn't find a place hear.  <br />The best part on the album is the 8 minute King For a Day. The band goes right into Shout!, and is a great moment in the concert, even better if you see it live. <br />Also, they could have fit even more songs on here that where originally played, like Maria and She. We are the champions was also cut, and that is amazing covered by green day, have no fear though, just download the live 8 version and you'll be fine.  <br />The DVD is just awful. The camera changes twice a second, and constantly shifts between color and black and white. By the time you get used to it, the song is over and we hear an interview. This doesn'tbother me as much, because even if the interviews wern't there,  many songs where cut that we would barley have more then half a green day show on our hands. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an enjoyable purchase, but an earlier live album from any other tour would have been ten times better
B000BJS4SU|4.0|It seems someone has a serious dislike of John Mayer. How else could you explain one star reviews from Tookie Williams, Murphy Brown and Moe from the Simpsons? I'm not sure what Amazon is smoking, but it's a shame they are letting someone spam the reviews like this.<br /><br />Seriously - this is a solid release. I don't care much for John's earlier music, but this CD is good. He has a solid rhythm section behind him, his playing is tight, his singing shows some real emotion this time around and he's only going to get better.<br /><br />There appear to be some real reviews from some blues snobs who genuinely hate the record - and that's okay. I'm a huge SRV fan myself, but I don't hold that against other artists playing the blues. Take this CD for what it is - a talented kid looking to stretch and play something besides meaningless pop. Give it a chance. It's good stuff.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Well. First, let me get this out of the way. The band is what Dream Theater or something would sound like, on an incredible acid trip. If one could epitomize 'random' into a band, The Mars Volta would be it. <br /> <br />But - lo! - the flaw of this album is not the near-A.D.D. musical structure. No, the flaw is with the vocalist. Truth be told, the band is talented, but they have to do something about the vocalist. He attempts to follow the melodies left by the music with lyrics. He simply is an awful vocalist, technically, so asking him to follow tune with a band like this would be the equilvalent of asking Rowling to write a good novel. It just won't happen. <br /> <br />I'm not going to bother getting into the 'songs' (I use that term quite loosely here). Instead, I'll say this:  <br /> <br />Ignore all the Amazon reviews for and against this album. Ignore even everything that I write. If the idea of an acid-trip Drean Theater interests you, buy the album. If not, don't buy the album. If you aren't sure, listen to some samples.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Upon hearing that Enya was going to be releasing a new album, I counted down the days until I would be able to listen to it.  So, when it was released on December 21st, I sat down and listened to the album in it's entirety in optimal listening conditions.     This album does not disappoint. Upon the first listening of the album, the tracks that stood out for me were \\"The River Sings\\", \\"Long Long Journey\\", and \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\". At first I wanted to dismiss \\"It's In The Rain\\", but like the rest of the album, after listening to it multiple times, mostly by chance (shuffle), I realized that it's one of my favorite tracks of the album. There is no bad track in this album, and is on par with a best of CD.     This is definitely a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. I only wish that she would release these wonderful masterpieces more frequently.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|You know there are times in your life where something happens and you will always remember it, even the smallest detail.  Like the first time you told someone you loved them, or perhaps your first kiss, or maybe in your car listening to a CD that moved you such a way that it will always leave an impression.  One of those moments came yesterday at 12:36 pm.  I was in my car and I just purchased the new Korn CD \\"See You On The Other Side\\".  We all know that I am one of Korn's biggest supporter, but this is just more then a fan talking.  This is a person talking about music that has moved him and made him once again have faith in an industry that has long been empty and full of misguided bands trying desperately to reach number one on TRL.  As I drove my car down Mason-Montgomery Road, I sat back and listened to my favorite band, minus the one person who I thought was the backbone of that band.  As songs ended and a new one began I realized that if Brian \\"Head\\" Welch departure from the band was inspiration for Korn to \\"turn the corner\\" and create one of the most amazing CD's I have ever heard then I say Brian you inspired me greatly, especially for a person that I never met, but you will not be missed in Korn anymore.  Songs like \\"Last Legal Drug\\", \\"It's Me Again\\", \\"Politics\\" and \\"Hypocrites\\" are songs that stick out as great songs and I recommend that you go out and buy this CD or at least download \\"Last Legal Drug\\" because that song is by far the greatest song ever imprinted on a CD.

The parents have to fight with Anna about being a donner for her sister, because Anna is tired of it.  This problem gets to the point where Anna gets a lawyer to get her parents to stop forcing her to be a donner.  This isn't the only problems that the parents have to face.  They also have to deal with their sick daughter that just wants to be normal and do what everyone else her age does.  Also they have a son that is a rebel and does all the things that parents hope that there kids will never do.  This is the type of story that you hope that will never happen.  It is a good book and I suggest reading it.
B000002A46|5.0|All I can say is that this whole CD is amazing. A must have for the holiday season. My favorite is \\"Jesus, Oh What a Wonderful\\" Child. It brings back childhood memories for me in church. Two thumbs up. I would give more thumbs than that.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I sit her and listen to SOAD, TOXICITY, and most of STEAL THIS ALBUM!, and i was stupid enough to rush myself into wasting money on Mesmerize, which DOES have its moments... but i truly believe that Hypnotize is 100% filler... I've never been dissapointed by this band... they did it though... <br /> <br />and jesus, serj, cut your hair... you look rediculous man
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall is one of the best jazz vocalists around today.  This CD features her performing  Christmas standards.  I love the big band sound that the orchestra provides on this album.  There are fun groovy sounding standards like Jingle Bells and Let It Snow.  I never thought that Christmas music could be romantic, but that is the feeling Krall creates on the track I'll Be Home For Christmas.  Winter Wonderland has a very sensual sound.  I loved the smooth bass guitar on this track.  Her rendition of White Christmas is absolutely lovely.  There is such a romantic sentiment to this song.  The Christmas Song is another highlight on this album.  It is a song about enjoying the simple things in life like spending time with family and listening to Christmas carols.  Santa Claus is Coming To Town is another highlight on this CD.  Krall really communicates a feeling of excitement and anticipation with her vocals on this track.  Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep.  It is a song that I am not famillar with, but I love the message of the song of being thankful for all of your many blessings in life.  Diana's piano playing and vocals on the track Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas are so relaxing.  I really enjoyed this song.  I loved listening this CD.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|After Day Without Rain I was starting to think that Enya's albums were sounding the same. At the same time I was afraid that if she did something any different it just wouldn't be Enya and I wouldn't like it. Well, Amarantine is different than many of her previous albums yet it's still Enya and Enya at her best. I was able to listen to the album straight through without skipping tracks. It's one of those albums you can sit and listen to from start to end and be ready to do it again. I would give this 6 stars if I could.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I liked Awake... Images & Words... Scenes From a Memory... Six Degrees... Train of Thought was okay... but then we get to Octavarium.  I listened to it once and found it in general to be supremely boring.  One of my friends always comments that he doesn't like Dream Theater because while they can play like madmen, they don't really have any soul; usually, I disagree with that, but Octavarium strikes me as formulaic and just \\"we threw something together so people would buy it.\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I heard this album in full when MTV.com was streaming it on The Leak and I went out and bought this album on it's day of release. This album is better than her previous record 2003's \\"American Life\\". The album art is also great, and looks very theatrical.  There is not one single slow song on here. It is full of pulsing rhythms and dance beats. If you enjoy clubbing then you will enjoy listening to this non-stop all dance record of power.  This album became #1, and beat Mariah Carey's \\"Emancipation Of Mimi\\" - which wasn't a bad record, but this one is far superior. Afterall Madonna is the Queen of Popular Music - Not Mariah, and shame on those Team L.A.M.B. loosers for putting Madonna down. Madonna's fans are strong enough in their vast quantity and have too much pride to act the way Mariah's fans do.   \\"Hung Up\\" is the first single of the album, and the whole album was produced by Madonna with Stuart Price, so it sounds great. It's Genre of music is Dance Disco, and Madonna gloriously brings back that Disco feeling in a new way by adding a new Techno sound to it. This is a great Feel good record and if you go out and get yourself a copy you won't regret your purchase. \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" is Madonna's best Millennium album yet, even beating 2000's \\"Music\\" in my oppinion, and is one of her late masterpieces.  Here is the Track by Track rating.  1. Hung Up.  This is the album's first single, and features a direct sample of ABBA's 1979 single \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme ( a man after midnight). If you have'nt heard this track yet ( unlikely due to the massive amount of airplay it is getting ) you might think it sounds old fashioned but surprisingly Madonna makes it sound very modern. Currently it is #1 in the Euro Top 20, and went #1. in Europe and the U.S. This song is better than any song off \\"American Life\\", so I suggest giving this one a try. Note this is not the 3:25 Radio-Edit version. It is a full album version and runs at 5:36. This is the extended video version. 5/5  2. Get Together.  This is quite a good song, and quite catchy. It sounds a lot like a dance track, but I don't think it would make Single status. At first listen i wasn't too impressed, but it does grow on you. Very trancey and hypnotic. The song breaks itself down, then builds itself up again.It repeats it self a lot and echoes which is a good effect. Overall it makes for a good listen. It sounds similar to \\"music's\\" \\"Runaway Lover\\". 3/5   3. Sorry.  This song sounds a lot like the Jackson's 1981 hit \\"Can You Feel It\\" because it uses the same base line. Great club track. The part where she says \\"You're not half the man you think you are\\" and \\"Don't explain yourself cos' talk is cheap\\" is great.  This song is about her saying she no longer needs her ex-lover, and for him not to come back grovelling. The foreign language parts are good too. This song could definetly make a #1.  Very enjoyable. You will find this song trapped inside your head and it is one of the albums best tracks. 5/5  4. Future Lovers.  The first thing I think of when I hear this song is a spacey type surrounding as if you are gazing up in to the universe. The vocals sound very Synthezised, and the song's tune sounds very modern New-Wave. The part where she says \\"I'm gonna tell you about love. Would you like to try\\" is very alluring and shows similarities to 1992's \\"Erotica\\". The song sounds quite Indie in parts but this makes a good effect. 4/5  5. I Love New York.  This song also sounds very futuristic. It praises New York above all other cities. Very repetative, but not annoying. It has an apocyliptic bass line. There is a lot of attitude in this song and Madonna clearly epresses her self by saying \\"If you don't like my attitude then you can F@#k 0ff. Just go to Texas. Isn't that where they golf\\". She repeats the phrase \\"Get off my street\\". Most people didn't like this song, but I do. 3/5  6. Let It Will Be.  This song is very catchy and enjoyable to listen to. You might find yourselftapping your feet to it. The lyrics are good and full of meaning. The song is about not letting people decieve you and seeing things clearly, and not letting people stand in your way. She glams her self up and presents her stardom in this track. Theres nothing you can do about it, so you might aswell just Let It Be. 4/5  7. Forbidden Love.  The vocals on this song sound very Daft Punk.The tune sounds quite asian and is very catchy and the chorus is very good. This song is one of the albums high lights. 4/5  8. Jump.  This is one of my favourite album tracks and is definetly single material. The song talks about Madonna realising that she can live her dreams because she is not afraid to abandon her before life and start it new. It is about having that leap of faith. The song sounds vey Trancy and it's best part comes at the end when the chorus repeats itself. This is one song that will stick in your head for quite a while. One of the Albums finest moments. 5/5  9. How High.  Once again the vocals to this track sound very enhanced and Electro - pop. The song is quite good and grows on you. It is not one of the albums finest points though. It sounds similar to any song from \\"Music\\". It talks about Madonna's fame and if it is all worth it. Overall I find it pretty average. 3/5  10. Isaac.  This song sounds very arabian, and is quite un-usual for a pop song. It is quite similar to \\"Frozen\\" from 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\". It has the back up vocals of an Arabian Man. This song is very catchy and I found it enjoyable to listen to. Madonna sings \\"Open up your heart, and cause my lips to speak. Bring the Heaven and the Stars down to Earth for me\\" and \\"Wrestle with your darkness. Angels call your name. Can you hear what they are saying. Will you ever be the same\\". This is a great track on the album, and an peculiar and interesting high point for it. 4/5   11. Push.  This song is another one of my favourite's on the album. It talks about the singers relationship with god. At leastI think so...The song is very meaningful with lyrics like \\"You push me when I don't appreciate. You push me not to lie, and not to hate. You push me when i'm wounded to the end. You push me when I really need a friend. You push me when, All I wanna do is cry. You push me when it's hard for me to try. Ill learn to do it for myself. Only you and no one else\\". This song is clearly about soul searching and self - growth, and having faith in god to help you along with it. Great song. 5/5  12. Like It Or Not.  This song was O.K., but not a favourite of mine. It talks about liking Madonna or not. It doesent matter because she likes herself, many other people do aswell and she's never gonna stop.  There are some good instramental parts in this track. She sings this song well, with confident vocals. It sounds sort of Greek when you listen to it, and is almost an interesting track as \\"Isaac\\". It will grow on you and you will start to like it. 4/5.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Diana Krall is a fantastic talent, but this is not her best effort. Certain Christmas albums, like Harry Connick Jr.'s When My Heart Finds Christmas, are instant classics. You can tell the first time you hear them that they will be around for a long time. Others, like Garth Brooks' Beyond the Season simply blend into the background of Christmas music. Twelve years later Harry Connick is still getting regular play in many CD players while Garth sits on the shelf (I realize these are two very different genres, but it still illustrates my point for those who listen to more than one genre...)<br /><br />As much as I love Diana, this album is destined to be like the latter. That doesn't mean this is a bad CD, as it's not. It's still very enjoyable. The Christmas Song is worth the price of admission alone. Oddly the pieces that stand out are the simple arrangements without the orchestra. The iTunes (album only, unfortunately) exclusive Jingle Bells outshines the track included here.<br /><br />If you are a jazz fan, this CD belongs in your collection. If you are looking to immerse yourself in Diana's vocals, you will be disappointed (with a few exceptions, like the aforementioned Christmas Song).<br /><br />I still give it a four out of five, but lament how much better this CD could have been.<br /><br />Joel
076790592X|5.0|\\"Forgive yourself before you die.  Then forgive others.\\" (Albom, 164) These are powerful words that could impact life.  Morrie Schwartz a respected professor from college and well known teacher of life's lessons narrates his life to a past student; anyone can not help but want to know more.  I would rate this book with a very high rating, five stars.  Mitch Albom, a former student, takes the lesson that this man teaches beyond the classroom.  The creative way in which Mitch presents Morries' story is truly amazing; I have a refreshed feeling the appreciation for life, love and family.  He starts he journey on his life as an adult with the joy and appreciation of his college professor.  As his life gets busy with what he feels is normalcy, he forgets the promise he made to keep in contact with Professor Morrie Schwartz. <br />Morrie's impact on the life of others was grand to many people. Having been hit with a terrible disease, he never allows this to affect his outlook on life. \\"When Morrie was with you he was really with you \\"(albom, 135).   One of the many quotes he told to Mitch was \\"First you have to understand forgive yourself before you can forgive others!  He was so strong with all his stories, when speaking of his father and fear together he mentions that he will always be surrounded by love he does not want to die the way his father did in fear. I would have to say Morrie Schwartz died with dignity.   <br />What I found a little upsetting was the uninformative items regarding his caregiver's impact on illness, how much or how little he impacted the caretaker's lives. Readers' will definitely walk away with a new out look on the life within their families, nature, and lessons in their journey. Friends and family are to be treasured and ranked high in all of life events. There was always something funny in Morris's discussions with Mitch; I believe this humor is meant to help with his illness and not to have people be disgruntled by his disease. <br />Valueswould be a very good way to express the inside of this book as well.  Depending on the different stages of life you have been through or are experiencing today, this book will impact your outlook advantageously.  This is a book to definitely own, so that you can re-read it and get additional insights with every read.  <br />Sharing his world of love and life with the world is something he will be and has been remembered for.  His impact was not only with Mitch but Ted Koppel.  Mr. Koppel had a great newscaster career, when his final day came out of all that he has seen and reported on Morrie Schwartz, was who he honored. <br />
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits is never boring and Rain Dogs is a particularly interesting collection of songs.  There is a lot going on here!  Highly reccomended!
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I have been a fan of Enya since I was 14.  Ever since then I got hooked to her music and even Clannad's.  I find that Amarantine is very mild by her standard.  There is something to do with the order of her songs.  The first song \\"Less than a pearl\\" gets off on a good start.  Unfortunately, the hit song \\"Amarantine\\" is second in line and it just ruins your appetite for every songs right after that.  My recommendation would be, put your CD player on RANDOM.  It feels much better to listen to few other good songs before you finally reached \\"Amarantine\\". <br /> <br />When you purchase this album, you will enjoy the authenticity in Enya's voice.  You know nobody can sing it like her and that's exactly what you are paying for.  Amarantine lacks the effect of giving you goosebumps and that's very hard to come by when we are talking about Enya.  But it does reduce the craving for the past five years since Days Without Rain.  This CD will make a great stocking stuffer and that's only because the recipient will appreciate that he/she doesn't have to pay money for it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was turned on to this series a few years ago by a good friend of mine, and I have been hooked ever since...this is the type of storytelling that I have missed in TV...if there were more shows of the same caliber as Firefly..I might just get Cable again...I often thought this series was a westernized version of Star Trek...only because of the same great storytelling they both share..I would recommend this to ANYONE who likes Sci-Fi...you will enjoy it

B00005JOHI|2.0|Read the book, didn't like it, why would I like the movie? The story of a family whose English countryside home and property must pass to the next male heir, just rubs me the wrong way.  There are five daughters in the family, and the mother's goal is to get them all married off advantageously (in case her husband drops dead and they are all kicked out).  I don't remember all the chickens, pigs and goats being all around the house, nor the wash hung on the line. Of course none of the girls, mother or father had to do a lick of work, they had servants for that...the father thanked one of them once for serving the food.  One maid hums as she passes out the clean laundry, so we're supposed to infer that as servants, they were content with their lot in life.<br /><br />Kiera Knightly plays Lizzie Bennet, who is supposed to be not very attractive, but very intelligent and witty. This is not convincing.  Ms. Knightly displayed a disturbing habit of wrinkling her nose and baring her overlapping incisors at the camera at almost every opportunity. In fact, I think her teeth should have gotten second billing.<br /><br />The rest of the story is basically the same as the novel and all following Harlequin romance stories - distant man, girl can't stand him, learns more about him, falls in love (especially when she sees his house), he falls in love with her, oh happy happy joy joy. The mother gets to brag on daughters, keep house, keep servants. Absolutely no contribution to society is necessary. Get what you can, survival is everything.
B00005JMJG|1.0|i didn't like it, it was dark the whole time and i couldn't even see it. which is supposed to be artsy but f*** artsy. i don't even f***ing get artsy. i want to see what i'm watching. additionally, it was such an unrealistic premise that i couldn't even get into it because i couldn't put myself into the situation at all. trying to erase someone or something from your memory is the most childish, ungrateful thing i have ever imagined. anyone who is so pessimistic that they can't even find one little thing they got out of a situation, (ESPECIALLY the bad ones, which i believe to be the most valuable,) so much that they want to erase it completely, is not only ignorant but deserves to be miserable. maybe being miserable would teach them something and then they could get to be a better person. instead, they just want to ignore it all and continue to f*** up their lives so that they can keep on being miserable because they are lazy asses and this whole movie was just about being lazy and selfish and i hated it, and i hate when jim carrey acts serious, and i f***ing hate kate winslet more than i can even explain because of this movie. i wanted to slap her the whole time. <br /> <br />i watched it a couple of years ago and can hardly remember it but these are the feelings i got out of it, or those that lasted this long anyway. thank you. <br /> <br />note to amazon: <br />i hope this will be shown as i stayed focused on the topics of the movie, despite my negative comments. this is what a review is for, i think it will be helpful and i got the impression from your banning of \\"spiteful remarks\\" that one is only allowed to say good things about a movie, and not the kind of things i have said. i have censored my language and have supported my opinions with legitimate points and hope that the screeners will have the integrity to accept this as the helpful review that it is and let it be shared with potential customers.
B00005JNZJ|2.0|400 years from now, 99% of the world's population has been wiped out by a virus.  Those remaining are living in a walled city and led by the Goodchild regime.  Five million people survived the plague in 2001, and five million still live in 2415.  The Goodchild regime is a totalitarian government, and the Monicans are focused on removing him from power by any means necessary.  The most dangerous Monican, Aeon Flux (Theron) accepts a specific mission from the Handler (McDormand) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Csokas).  With the help of her sidekick, Sithandra (Okonedo), she ventures into his fortress.  When the time comes to pull the trigger, something happens that will change their world forever.<br /><br />\\"Aeon Flux\\" is the film version of some short cartoons aired on MTV in the 1990's, and is a mixed bag, sometimes working and sometimes not -- mostly not.  There are a lot of nods to the cartoon, and they seem kind of silly when not in cartoon form.  Theron is wrong for the role, and never really feels right to this fan of the cartoon.  The story is moderately interested, but poorly executed for the most part.  \\"Aeon Flux\\" was a disappointment for me, and I can't help but think that with a different cast and crew, a better job could have been done.
0553801503|5.0|A Feast for Crows is 100% Martin, and I thoroughly enjoyed wolfing it down.   <br /> <br />What The Feast lacks in action it makes up for in character development, and the wealth of Jaime and Cersei chapters are a particular treat.  Arya and Sansa are coming into their own as well, and we can expect great things from these POVs in GRRM's upcoming novels.         <br /> <br />While Martin introduces a great deal of new POVs in this novel, his purpose is not to bog us down with a gross of primary characters, but to do justice to the entire realm of Westeros.  He needs eyes and ears (where is Varys when we need him) to unfold the many happenings across this vast land, and to make them real.  Sooner than later all of these POVs, and the forces they represent, will converge (at least those that are left).  <br /> <br />I will join the ranks of the many people bemoaning the missing POVs (particularly Tyrion); however, too many people seem to be dwelling on this.  A Song of Ice and Fire is fantasy like no other, and this is a worthly companion to its predecessors.  Certainly, it feels more like an appetizer at this point, but \\"the seed is strong\\" and GRRM is still 100% on target.   <br />   <br />
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I would have preferred to give the album 2.5 stars, but it's no option here at amazon.com, and I chose 2 to balance the over-enthusiastic reviews. I am a SOAD fan, and anyone who spends time listening to music cannot possibly agree with the multitude of 5-star ratings found here. <br /> <br />System of a Down's latest album Hypnotize reflects an awkward stage in the bands development. Guitarist and singer Daron Malakian's expanded role contrasts sharply with the band's lead vocalist, Serj Tankian, whose style hasn't noticeably changed since System's first release in 1998. As a result of the differences in the two songwriters, Hypnotize is a very dissonant album, and the tension between Daron and Serj is distracting. <br /> <br />The first half of the album is consistent in theme and musically mediocre. While the underlying message is an important one, calling for social justice in a manner that recalls Rage Against the Machine, the lyrics are unpolished and repetitive. The best parts of the first seven songs are the rare, quiet interludes that fall between Serj's edgy screams. There are a few instances of Daron trying to escape the traditional System sound with new guitar styles and even a run of pop in the fifth track, \\"Stealing Society,\\" but overall his playing shows neither innovation nor improvement over previous albums. The first half of the album culminates in \\" Holy Mountains,\\" the eighth track and one of the few in which the two prominent band members are able to work together and combine their talents. \\"Holy Mountains\\" is also the album's longest track, playing out at five minutes and twenty-eight seconds. <br /> <br />The second half of Hypnotize is pointedly different from the first, and begins with track nine, \\"Vicinity of Obscenity.\\" After listening to the song, it came as no surprise to find that Serj wrote all of the lyrics. This track oozes Serj, but the only sign of musical development comes in the form of a funky chorus via Daron. The second half of the album loses focus, as is evident of \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" and the following two tracks, both written completely by Daron. In \\"She's Like Heroin,\\" Daron falls back on his familiar theme of drug abuse, and the song feels simply out of place. \\"Lonely Day\\" is a good tune, but there is nothing fresh to it, and the lyrics are disappointingly thin. The last track of the album, \\"Soldier Side,\\" is one of the best, and does a fine job of concluding the Mesmerize/Hypnotize set. <br /> <br />Overall, System's latest is repetitive and only provides a few too-short moments of musical excellence. The lyrical content is well chosen (if not familiar to System fans), but the music itself is less than spectacular. When the album is over a short thirty-nine minutes and forty-eight seconds after it has begun, one is left with a lukewarm opinion of the band's creative capability.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I found this show through my mother who called me to tell me to give it a try. I am an RN in a hospital very similar to this one and it is amazing how a lot of the things that are portrayed in the series happens. Different names and faces and details, but all in all it is accurate and hilarious to watch. I LOVE IT!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great ripping scifi fantasy yarn. Great characters and great story telling. Just the right amounts of action, comedy, thrills, horror, drama, romance and violence. You will not be dissappointed. Buy now and maybe we will get sequels. Also, unlike one idiot said earlier, the viewing of the TV series is completely unneccesary to enjoy this A grade movie.

It is tired, dated and just plain dull. <br /> <br />Jack is dating Diane's daughter but they come to realize they should be together. <br /> <br />If you want to see Jack or Diane comedies buy As Good as it Gets or First Wives Club.  They are actually funny!!
1895565669|5.0|I first read this book in 5th grade.  I truly enjoyed it.  I thought that it was silly how the mom would climb in the window, but even at the age of 10 I realized that she could never do that, the author was just showing the reader that parents will love you unconditionally as long as they are able to.   <br /> <br />Some people read waaaay too much into this book, and try to make it sound disturbing and sick.  Those of you who say that it caused your anxiety about death should really go talk to your parents and ask them why you never discussed death as a child.  Did no one you knew ever pass away?  You have never encountered death?  My daughter is 5 years old and the first time I read the book to her, she asked me \\"did his mom go to Heaven?\\"  I'm not afraid to talk to my children about the tough issues they will face in life.  The sooner they learn that death does happen, the easier it will be for them when someone they love dies. <br /> <br />If the mother dying in the end is such a big issue for some, then sit down with your children and talk about it.  Explain to them that life is a cycle.  Everyone dies when it's their time.  You don't know when it will happen, but that is why you should live your lives to their fullest.  Love those you love with joy and understanding and appreciate what you have for the rest of your life.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult is an amazing writer; her novel My Sister's Keeper is an example of this talent. There were strengths and weaknesses in the novel, but overall I enjoyed reading the book. The strengths in My Sister's Keeper are the characters - a dynamic family and the serious topic that tears that family apart, but also pulls them together. I thought that the relationships that existed between the family members and how they pulled together (and apart) was what made the story so enjoyable. Picoult's use of medical terms made the story interesting and enlightening as well.  <br /> <br />The weaknesses of My Sister's Keeper were the topic and how each chapter was presented. The topic was really depressing and a tear-jerker. But it was a strength as well. It was confusing at first to follow each chapter because they were different perspectives. But this also added to the novel's charm. <br /> <br />I recommend reading this story, for anyone!

B000BJ7BCK|4.0|I went into this movie with mild expectations.  The previews looked interesting, but teenage superheroes have been done to death in comics.  It's hard to find any new territory.  But this film succeeds admirably. <br /> <br />Equal parts teen film and superhero movie, it's surprising how well the two genres mesh here.  There's a creativity at work that builds a seamless combination that has all the story elements of each that work together to create a terrific, fun film. <br /> <br />The writing, acting, and special effects are all top notch.  It's a little predictable, but still entertaining all the way through.  There's even some nice superhero action thrown in. <br /> <br />Overall, a very entertaining movie.
B0000024JN|5.0|You can't say enough about this album. Classic rock samples, great DJ scratching, irresistibly funky beats and three of the hottest emcees (with undoubtedly the best chemistry hip-hop has ever seen, and still is today 20 years after their debut) in hip-hop all combined together to make one of rap's landmark albums. 5 mics from the source, 5 stars from Amazon and more radio play than anything I've ever heard. Hell, 103.9 (it's not even hip-hop, it's an alternative rock station!) here in Arizona is still playing \\"Girls\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" on a regular basis and the songs are older than half the kids that listen to Fall Out Boy or whatever else they play. What the hell have you been doing if you dont have this album already?
0440241588|4.0|In \\"The Broker,\\" John Grisham combines all of his customary ingredients for success -- high-powered lawyers, politics, escapism -- with a couple of new elements: espionage, international intrigue, travel, and food. The resulting concoction is not as taut as Grisham's earlier courtroom dramas, but it's pleasing nonetheless. <br /> <br />Much of the novel takes place in Italy, a place that Grisham loves and knows well. The narrative at times morphs into a travelogue and at others into language lessons. Since the book made me want to visit Italy and learn the language, I'd say Grisham's writing experiment is quite effective. <br /> <br />The pace of \\"The Broker\\" is much slower than most of Grisham's previous novels, perhaps deliberately reflecting the slower pace of Italian cities. Things don't start to escalate until the final hundred pages or so. The story of the main character outwitting highly trained spies and assassins is a little far-fetched, but still enjoyable. Grisham's finest literary sleight-of-hand is the fact that he is able to turn a main character with a despicable past into a likeable and sympathetic character. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that the book is in need of editing. Some episodes drag on too long, some words are overused (porticoes), and minor characters come and go for no apparent reason. This is what editors are for, and so many major authors (Grisham, King, Rowling) unfortunately think they are immune.
0517123207|5.0|I had an appendix embedded in my body, but it served no useful purpose, became inflamed, and was removed.  This book, along with those by Richard Dawkins (Blind Watchmaker), Ernst Mayr (What Evolution Is), Steven Stanley (Macroevolution: Pattern and Process), Stephen J. Gould (The Structure of Evolutionary Theory), and Geerat Vermeij (Evolution and Escalation) help explain why and how I happened to come by this \\"feature\\".  Once you've finished those, Weishampel's \\"Dinosauria\\" is quite a bit of fun, too, as is Harper's Numerical Palaeobiology.  If you prefer shells to bones, Boardman's \\"Fossil Invertebrates\\" is a great read.  If you'd rather do it on the cheap, Google Scholar \\"evolution\\".  Of the 3.2 million hits, I would guess at least a third pertain to biotic evolution.
B000AP04EW|5.0|Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie both share a chemistry with each other that's undeniable. Personally, I think this movie is perfectly blended with action and humor at the same time. Pitt and Jolie both portray spies that have been married for 5 or 6 years, but neither one of them know it. The fun begins when they find out the truth about one another. I thought it was hilarious to see these 2 married people trying to kill each other. I think a lot of people missed the real element of this movie. It was not action drama. It was more romantic comedy with a splash of action pitting husband against wife, or a battle of the sexes if you will. Jolie kicks butt as always, and Pitt does a great job too as always. This movie was fantastic in my opinion.
B000002LND|5.0|Yes. Indeed. Madonna has what we call star quality. To<br /><br />start with Track 1 Holiday, and end it with Track 17 Rescue Me, i wonder if i need a rescue too. To be short. This collection is popmusic gold. Here are all the favourites from the 80 ths. There are some tracks that are outstanding when it comes to songwriting/ music.  Track 9 Papa dont Preach is one of my favourites. This has an atmosphere that make me chills. The synth strings, here voice, gives the ultimate experience to bring joy for your ears and mind.<br /><br />Track 11 La Isla Bonita is an another great experience. The acustic guitars, gives a quality  sting to the whole experience.  Track 14. Cherish.Woooooooah. This is my best experience with Madonna, anytime. This is simple, this is right to the point, this is the ultimate popsong. It`s make a stonecold heart soft. This is mind power, and will swing youre thoughts around in many different direction, at least<br /><br />for a couple of minutes. There is to much hate in this world. In this song you got a better suggestion. More Cherish, pleaaaase. It`s simple, but sometimes it`s hard. Very hard.<br /><br />The other tracks are also great songs, but my Three favourites, shines all trough.
0884271536|5.0|This book is actually fiction, although it intended to be used as a instructional manual for implementing a new approach to project management.  As a project manager I think the book is very practical and I think his approach would work very well for many projects.  However, the theory that Goldratt proposes goes against all of the other commonly used project management tools (Gantt, Critical Path, PERT) that are based on timelines and milestones.   <br /> <br />The book is written from a common-sense approach (in contrast to the approach used by textbooks) and some of the problems it addresses are: <br />1. Projects often run over budget but rarely finish under budget <br />2. Multitasking is actually detrimental to projects  <br />3. Constraints arrise when multiple projects use the same resources <br />4. The true cost of a project (which Goldratt says is much higher than most think) <br />5. Negotiations with subcontractors used on a project <br />6. Net Present Value and payback period are inadequate measurements for the cost of a project <br /> <br />Don't be discouraged if you don't understand any of the typical project management jargon.  Goldratt does a great job of introducing each concept and describing the basic, underlying concepts.  The technical concepts are explained in question-answer form that would be similar to attending a seminar.   <br /> <br />Lastly, Goldratt uses two types of projects (product development and construction) as examples in this book.  However, the concepts and his approach could be applicable to many different types of projects.  In my opinion, the determining factor for applicability of Goldratt's approach is the structure of the organization and not the type of project;  the less burocratic, the more applicable.
0375703764|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is written as if it was an art film. It draws you in and forces you to experience what the characters are experiencing. Very enthralling.
B000001E18|4.0|First and foremost, do not start listening to U2 with this album.  It's such a shock to listen to this album after hearing their most played work.  Definitely listen to Achtung Baby before you listen to this album.  It'll make more sense. <br />Beyond the disclamer, Zooropa is a very intriguing album.  Much more mellow than Achtung Baby and almost as mellow as Joshua Tree, Zooropa captures a balance and a forward push at the same time.  The sonic collages that permeate this album are at times gorgeous, at times disquieting.  The title track opens with a sonic mish-mash, and then when Edge's guitar enters, the mood of the song and the rest of the album is set: atmospheric and mellow.  The title track is almost progressive rock with it having three parts: the subtle cacophonic opener, the moody middle, and the anthemic closer.  With the line \\"Uncertainty could be the guiding light,\\" U2 prepares everyone for the soundscapes to follow.  \\"Babyface\\" is a good song, but not the one that should have followed the title track.  It's mellow to a fault.  \\"Numb\\" would have been the perfect second track, sounding unlike any U2 song that had come before it, and still unique to this day.  The Edge carries a monotone drone while his guitar is processed to death.  With Larry Mullen and Bono carrying the haunting backing vocals, this song is an unusual U2 classic.  \\"Lemon\\" is my favorite track on the album.  Even though it hints at the focus of the next album Pop, this track is much more fun and even more intriguing than anything off that album.  A German disco-laden song, \\"Lemon\\" screams irony, and Brian Eno jumps in with the band for vocals.  If anything proves that Eno is a legendary producer, it's \\"Lemon.\\"  Following that is the best track on the album: \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!).\\"  A blatant love song influenced by Wim Wenders's movies Wings of Desire and Faraway, So Close, Bono sings about love in the Generation X, and the lyrics couldn't be any better.  The rest of the album doesn't reach the heights of the first half, but the two closing songs, \\"Dirty Day\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\" with Johnny Cash, end the album on a high note.  U2 would make their biggest blunder with Pop, but Zooropa, sandwiched between the classic Achtung Baby and the blunder Pop, is one of U2's lost gems.  It may not be their best, but it can definitely be classified as a diamond in the rough.  A recommended listen.
B000002O51|4.0|It's hard to believe that Third Stage came out almost 20 years ago. I remember listening to it on cassette in my ugly red Horizon going to high school. It took Tom about 8 years to finish this album after 1978's Don't Look Back. But it still went to #1 thanks to the single Amanda (which also went to #1). The other singles were We're Ready and Can'tcha Say, both of which charted well too. Third Stage has the trademark soaring harmonized guitar lines that Boston became known for and Brad Delp's vocals are as powerful as ever. There is not really any song on this album that I dislike so I can always listen to it from start to finish. My favorite songs are The Launch, I Think I Like It, and Hollyann. The reason I give it 4 stars is because there are not as many standout tracks as on the first album. Also, the production is a bit too grand on some of the songs. But Third Stage is a good album despite some of the criticism heaped on it.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|As most of you have already figured out, Korn is not exactly the same as they used to be.  But so what.  Korn has evolved from their old sound to do something they have never done before, and the results are great.  So many people expect bands to always stay the same and play the exact same music from the start of their careers to the end, but doesn't that get a little stale.  I have been a Korn fan since day 1, and back when they first came out all I listened to was Metal and other heavy music.  Now it has been 11 years since their first release and they have changed (evolved) just like me.  I no longer only listen to metal, but I love bands like Coldplay and Oasis, but still love Korn.  Am I upset about their different sound.  No Way!! Great bands always look to change themselves.  If you want to listen to another Blink-182 than maybe Korn should have stayed the same.  Blink-182 played the same stuff over and over and guess what, it got stale and people lost interest.  Korn is doing something different not only for themselves, but to keep things interesting within their music.  There are bound to be people who like it, love it, or hate it, but for the people that don't like it because it isn't like their old stuff, then you are stuck in the past and havn't grown up yourselves.  Korn has and so have the people that don't care if they changed.  If you don't like this album, hey, at least it isn't stale.  It's a fresh new sound for them, and I love it
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Korn, Korn. Korn.    Everyone has an opinion , thats why they exist. Our beloved band has lost a leg or an arm, or our family has lost a child, however you look at it there has been a great loss to what we all know as the most incredible form of metal our decade has experienced. Lets set a place for head at the dinner table and weep bitterly. Is everyone done whining, Now lets see, despite their loss, our loss, they continue on with their art. Most bands would have quit or replaced Head. Korn moved on with their integrity and dedication to be the best damn band ever. They know what they have lost , they know it will be bring change. And remember change, however devastating, is always good (if survived). Sure, it is different yet it has evolved to a higher state, a heavier state. jonathan didnt die and munky didnt cut off his arm, no  they became stronger, tougher and better, their art has become more powerful , more dedicated. They are the artists and they have proved themselves year after year and album after album to us, the fans. Now are we gonna be a bunch of lil teenage whiny bi@#$es and complain cause it doesnt hit us exactly how we want? Or are we gonna step back and look at true art and appreciate it, especially the fact that is was created during a tornado in their lives.  How truly incredible these guys are.      -Last thing, there is no other Korn, no one can be them, no one could imitate them. In the same respect, they can not be anyone else. THEY ARE THE ARTISTS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, IF THEY CREATE IT, IT IS AS GREAT AS THE FIRST AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.  It doesnt matter to me what they create, if it comes from them it is them , if it is them it is a part of everything they have ever done, its all connected, blind, daddy, i did my time, twisted transistor. How could it not be? There are no new band memebers, they are still the Gods of metal.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|OK! Let's start out by saying something to those who have a problem with KoRns supposed \\"New\\" sound. Yes, they sound different then they did on the first Cd, but that was ten years ago, what do you excpect?! People change and go through things, such as \\"Heads\\" departure for the band, and please in your reviews don't write about how he rocks or sucks, no one cares he's not in the band or on this album, the question is can you tell? Anyway, back to the point. I thought this album was very fun and very fresh, fresh being the key word, if they just made another album like their previous everyone would complain \\"It sounds like all the others!\\" they took a risk with a new kind of a sound and it worked. The response has been huge. Some songs of course were better than others, I think the fact that you can buy extra tracks off the internet that weren't included ([...]) is kind of dumb and a waste. Also I was very angry buy the fact that the Cd had anti-piracy warnings all over it (mostly because it detracted from the artwork (inside cover) and because the band themselves had voiced their opinon that they we're not against piracy but who knows maybe it was the label that put that on their Cd, it was just slightly irratating. So, better songs :  <br />Twisted Transistor (of course, it's the single and has a great hook and great lyrics, don't be surprised at the different intro to the song than the radio version) <br />Politics and Hypocrites very good pairing, I put them together because on the Cd it seems that the lyrics are themed and flow through each other creating a great force of two songs, I personally like Hypocrites better though. <br />Souvenir took me a while to get into but when I kept listening to it I really got into it. Cool song. <br />Throw Me Away AMAZING, loved it, I was in my room walking across it when Jonathan started singing and I just had to stop. The words are beautiful and heartfelt. Definatly relatable. <br />Getting Off Super fun. It just makes mesmile. If you liked ADIDAS then you'll like this, quite simalar and just fun with awesome lyrics like \\"Squezing your own ass so pretty.\\"It's cute. <br />Liar Powerful. Anyone whose had a friend betray you for someone else and you try to get through to them and they aren't hearing you. This is definatly the song for you. <br />For No One Reminds me of a mix of other KoRn, \\"Reclaim my Place\\" and \\"Got the Life\\" the same sort of theme from \\"Reclaim\\" with the funness of \\"Life\\". Pretty cool. <br />And finally TearJerker the title is fits perfectly for this song. No KoRn song I have ever heard has sounded anything like this and it is unbelievable, so soft and yet so emotion prevoking you can see everything Jon is trying to say. You just have to hear it to understand. It's the perfect way to end the album.
B0000256VK|4.0|No question that this album was produced immaculately.  It sounds great and is mellow, soulful and romantic.  If you're in the right mood for this stuff you'll eat it up.  When I'm not I find it can come off as smarmy since Brian Ferry's vocals can seem overly suave sometimes. <br /> <br />Definitely a highlight of 80s music, which I think those not intimately familiar with it will chalk up to bands like Depeche Mode, The Smiths and Culture Club and look no further for the stuff that was more original and less overplayed by the 80s revival movement.  If that's all you know about the 80s you need to explore this album along with many others that are timeless and much under-appreciated. <br /> <br />It's mellow, so don't expect to get the adrenoline pumping. If you don't like mellow and romantic music then don't bother buying it.  But it's one of the best romantic albums in the past 30 years.  And I'm not talking about boy-band commodity velveeta.
B000AP04L0|5.0|We've owned the original Office Space DVD since it first came out, but it came out early in the days of DVD's when production companies has not yet grasped the value of \\"Special Features\\" - deleted scenes, commentary tracks, outtakes, interviews with the cast, etc. - all of those features which we have come to expect from a DVD.  The lack of ANY of these features on the original DVD always made me a little bit sad; I knew they could do better.<br /><br />My prayers were answered when this DVD came out.  Yes, I bought it, despite the fact that I already have the darn movie on DVD and despite the fact that I was really SUPPOSED to be Christmas shopping.  The special features (I'm sorry... I meant FLAIR) are above par for DVDs... commentary tracks, deleted scenes.... everything you could want and more.  Watching them is almost like rediscovering the movie.<br /><br />Yeah, we're gonna have to ask you to... um... go ahead and buy this movie again.
0440211727|5.0|Writer John Grisham's first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\", cemented him as the premier writer of the courtroom drama.  This book is, perhaps, his best work to date.<br /><br />\\"A Time to Kill\\" is set in Ford County, Mississippi, more specifically, the town of Clanton.  (Grisham also set his novel \\"The Last Juror\\" in Clanton/Ford County.)  Lawyer Jake Brigance has just inherited a giant office space from his former employer, Lucien Wilbanks, and has gone into practice by himself.  It seems as though his next case is perhaps his most shocking: two white men, Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard, brutally raped ten-year old Tonya Hailey, got caught, and were being put on trial.  The case changes course, however, when Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the rape victim, ruthlessly murders his daughter's rapists with an (illegally bought) M-16; the case then shifts from a rape case to a murder case.<br /><br />Things really heat up when Jake starts receiving death threats over the phone and the Ku Klux Klan starts back up and begins burning crosses in people's yards (and burn down Jake's house while his wife, Carla, is away on vacation).<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jake Brigance knows that Carl Lee Hailey is guilty of the murders, but tries to get a \\"not guilty\\" verdict anyways.  If you want to know what happens, well, you won't get it out of me.<br /><br />\\"A Time to Kill\\" is one of the best books I have read and will continue to read it and Grisham's other masterpieces.<br /><br />Other John Grisham books that I would recommend:<br /><br />-The Runaway Jury<br /><br />-The Last Juror<br /><br />-The Pelican Brief<br /><br />-The Firm<br /><br />-Skipping Christmas<br /><br />-The Testament<br /><br />-The Street Lawyer<br /><br />P.S.  There are some adult themes and coarse language in this book, so it might not be appropriate for some younger readers.  Still, it's an awesome book
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Hey-- this album is classic swagger with an attitude! I can never get tired of listening to this one.  With this offering there is still some new nuance or some intelligent aspect yet to discover - and after 40 years this is no small feat!! All the songs are excellent and at this point in pop history (1965) absolutely no one wrote songs like this.  Dylan created his own genre- and no one yet has improved on it.<br /><br />I will not name the songs- if you have it you know them so well and if you don't, get this and you will. But what comes to mind are the lyrics that stay with you.  Little snippets that take on their own life after you know the wit and irony. \\"My advice is to not let the boys in.\\" \\"I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.\\" \\"Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough.\\" And, of course all the things that happen in Highway 61 all happen \\"about the time the doorknob broke.\\" I rank this album to be one of the highest of all time. If you love intelligence, stream-of-conciousness, and interpretation this is a must own. It has lost none of it's edge and probably never will. If you are a Dylan fan - it is an endless pleasure.
0060899190|5.0|Frank Warren's compilation is the perfect physical manifestation of his website (postsecret.com). The book makes a great gift and addition to a personal library, particularly for those of us who are fascinated by the people around us. The project itself is a great undertaking and deserves the support.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|This movie would still be complete in my eyes if the inner third of it were taken out. The beginning of the movie and the last half hour of the movie completely capture the heart, spirit, beauty and story of the book. In between that, there are a lot of contrived moments of tension that take away from the story and make it less believable because they are way too dramatic, and also they showed kids several times in seeming danger of imminent death. There were several roller-coaster simulations that were obviously put in just to be titillating. And I had trouble believing that Santa would have so many inept people working for him as to let the train go out of control or almost get swallowed in a frozen lake, and also things that happen in Santa's town itself, like the star on the tree getting knocked off and almost killing an elf, and part of the train breaking away and careening through the town with 3 kids aboard. I mean, come on!! How many problems can there truly be on one train ride? The storywriters managed to cover all the possibilities, I think.<br /><br />Maybe kids really get a kick out of these 'action' sequences, but they seem like they belong to a different movie. And I think they could very easily scare younger kids. It seems to me like they were added just to ensure that this would be a full-length movie that could generate more cash than a 40-minute TV special would. I agree too with another reviewer who noticed that the train conductor was pretty harsh - which wasn't really the fault of Hanks' acting but rather the script.<br /><br />So, my recommendation is to watch just the first and last parts of this movie. Watch the first part through the wonderful hot chocolate serving scene, and then skip ahead until the kids are standing in the middle of the North Pole main square waiting for Santa to arrive, and watch it from that point on till the end. Those are the scenes that are mainly taken from the book, and those are the scenes that moved me and made me feel that it was a film worth watching.<br /><br />I gave it an extra star for the visuals, which were stunning. The human/elf characters seemed Play-doh like, but I got used to that, and everything else was visually breathtaking.t was a film worth watching.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|After looking at a lot of the reviews of Madonna's latest albums, I found there seems to be two camps, those who love everything she put out unquestioningly, and those who hates her guts. The latter doesn't even talk about the album. They just hate her. And those who said that Kylie Minogue does it better? Madonna did it first and did it better. Kylie is one of a legions of wannabes ranging from Debbie Gibson, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera to Britney Spears. Madonna paved the way. The rest followed, but never was able to keep up, much less pass Madonna.    As for the album itself, I belong to the camp that have a somewhat so-so opinion about it. It is not her best work, nor would I say it is that bad either.    The first track \\"Hung Up\\" is about the best song on the album, which means you shouldn't raise your expectations too high...this is not \\"Erotica\\", and definitely not \\"True Blue\\". \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" 's PR campaign claimed Madonna is going back to her roots in dance music...but don't expect to find any Patrick Leonard or Stephen Bray collaborations here. Melody and lyrically-wise, Madonna is still stuck to her \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life\\" phase, only this time there is a perpetual dance beat in the background.     The second best track on the CD is the second song, \\"Get Together\\", where Madonna practically oozes sexuality. Other potential hits are the much lauded \\"Sorry\\" and once again, an exceptional collaboration with her brother-in-law Joe Henry in \\"Jump\\". Its chorus reminds me of \\"Are You Ready For It\\", an early track Madonna recorded when she was with the group Emmys. The last track \\"Like It Or Not\\" is reminiescent of her remake of \\"Fever\\"    \\"Future Lovers\\" is a cute little diddly that is reminescent of \\"Stay ('81)\\" from \\"Pre-Madonna\\" (later \\"From the Beginning\\") with its seeming out-of-body Astral-plane feel. \\"I Love New York\\" is a bit overrated. \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" shows how frustrating some of Madonna's work can be since \\"Erotica\\": repetitive lyrics and dull melodies.    \\"Push\\" has interesting lyrics, but has a grating beat and pace. \\"How High\\" has Lady M bemoaning the price of fame for the umpteenth time and in \\"Isaac\\" we have some guy with an annoying voice singing duet with Madonna in Hebrew (or Yiddish, whatever).    Fans of Madonna's official fan club ICON has a free download bonus song called \\"Super Pop\\" which, unless you are a rabid Madonna fan like I am, you can really live without (the song is pop but far from SUPER).    \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\"'s success, ultimately, doesn't lie in its own merits, but in the fact that it came after the dull \\"American Life\\".
B0006GAOBI|3.0|I have seen Donnie Darko many times and I love the movie.  The Director's Cut is a confusing rendition of the original that is devoid of most of the open interpretation the movie once had.  I will not watch this version again.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Reading a \\"marc woos\\" review i was struck by the line \\"pick up a beatles album or led zep iv or Nirvana never mind and then tell me that mcr is still very good\\"  <br />ok. I have the blue album, the red album, abbey road.  I dont have led zep iv but i have listened to it i do have houses of the holy, in through the out door,the early years, and the bbc sessions.  I am a lifetime fan of all three of the groups you have mentioned.  I also enjoy a wide variety of music in addition to rock.  <br />First off a comparison with led zepelin or (another reviewer stated) lamb of god is ridiculous. you are comparing apple to oranges . as far as complaining about their outfits and how they dress.... so you think robert plant and davdi lee roth and a host of late 70's and 80's rock singers that wore spandex and tights and used more hairspray than a strip club is sexy?  Can we all agree that popular rock singers and bands have a flair for dressing in a gaudy and somewhat amusing fashion. <br />My Chemical Romance is not groundbreaking not really revolutionary.  If you are looking for another hendrix then dont buy this.  However if you want to hear something slightly different with an obviously passionate lead singer then buy this cd. Its nicve driving rock not to hard but not blink 182 either.  Give them a fair shake I havent been dissapointed by them.
B000BKJ78K|1.0|I think that perhaps they are trying to scam people like me who have refused to buy the special editions versions.  I saw this package in the store, and it doesn't talk about it being the special editions, it mentions the classic films.  Combined with the classic poster art, I had to wonder if my dreams had come true and Lucas had some how come to his senses and released the originals finally.  I'm glad I could look here and find out the truth about these releases.  I'm sure many others will not do the research and pick up this set thinking it to be the originals. <br /> <br />I don't mind a lot of the special effects added, but as was said previously, things like Greedo shooting first change the story and in a ludicrous fashion (a trained bounty hunter fires for no reason and manages to miss at point blank range?!).  Some day hopefully these people will realize how much money they could make by simply cleaning up the originals and giving us what we really want to see.  Until then, I guess I'll keep hoping my VHS copies hold up for my son to enjoy. <br /> <br />Another kind of stupid thing is the way they talk about these movies as if the reason to see them is to continue the story from the new movies, it almost comes across as this was some cheap Disney direct to video sequel instead of the superior original stories.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|You simply can't judge this album in the context of KoRn's other work, for several reasons.  Obviously, the departure of Head and the addition of influence from producer's like Atticus Ross have made a huge change in the songs.  Also, KoRn clearly had to change in order to stay relevant, so it would have been foolhardy to stay on the same track as, say, TALITM, an album which showed the folly of trying to not change.  Given that, the new album is amazing.  Here, in convenient list form, are the reasons.  ------->The songs aren't structured the same way as any other KoRn album, there's lots of trippy industrial influence throughout the whole thing, and the catchy choruses (ex. \\"Getting Off\\", \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"Twisted Transistor\\") are rarely followed by the brutal climaxes seen on pretty much every other KoRn album.  Initially, I found this to be annoying, like the music was missing something.   -------->Although a few songs (ex. \\"Liar\\", \\"For No One\\") are reminiscent of earlier work, most of the album is really alot different than anything else they've ever made.  In order to appreciate the album, you have to listen to it several times and ignore the two or three songs which are either unnecessary or annoying.   -------->The ending falls short.  I really like this new style after listening to the album for a while (I dl'ed the songs early, then bought the deluxe edition) but \\"Tearjerker\\" falls short of a KoRn quality ending, even compared to TALITM's \\"When Will This End\\".         -------->MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE TO GET THE DELUXE EDITION AND/OR DL ALL THE B-SIDES TRACKS.  They're absolutely amazing songs that should have been on the album.  In particular, \\"Le Petit Mort\\" and \\"Appears\\" are really cool/heavy songs which deserve to have been on the album, but deviated too much from the style of it(or something like that, it was a mistake to leave them out in the first place).
B00005JOGU|5.0|Before reviewing Capote, it must be stated that the film presents several layers much like a tree has year rings that can be seen when the tree has been cut down.  The story converges around one main topic from which it also diverges into several different ideas.<br /><br />A shot of the Midwestern countryside opens the film in which a car rolls into parking outside a white two-story house close to Holcomb, Kansas.  The weather radiates a chillingly unwelcome atmosphere enhanced by overbearing silence of solitude, as two teens step out of the vehicle.  Remarkably subtle editing allows the audience to enter the privacy of the home that reveals family trinkets and portrait photos.  Again, the silence is devastating, as the two teens enter the picturesque farmhouse with scanning eyes, which suggestively brings the notion to that of a rescue mission seeking for survivors.  Later, a girl makes a macabre discovery on the second floor where a body rests in the bed adjacent to the blood-splattered wall.<br /><br />It is a shockingly dreadful event, if one considers the reality of the situation and disregards the contemporary desensitization to violence in cinema.  Immediately the mind seeks for motives; both in a sense to why the crime was committed and why the first time feature director Bennett Miller took advantage of the gruesomeness of the crime in the opening of the film.  The film brings the audience on a lengthy and personal journey through Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who seeks the truth to the hideous quadruple Kansas murder.  Within the grisliness of the crime, a fascinating scenario begins to evolve that triggers the curiosity in the same morbid manner that serial killers and bizarre events do.  Thus, the story really hooks the audience.<br /><br />After the initial scene of the Kansas farmhouse with the dead body, a symmetrical shot of a tree line in the horizon abruptly jumps to a scene of the New York skyline.  These two different shots provide a path that suggests the very contrasting elements within the film.  It is within these contrasts a powerful cinematic event emerges, as the film wrestles with sexual orientation, good and evil, and emotions.<br /><br />At first sight, the film tells an unlikely, yet true, story about the extravagantly flamboyant gay man, Capote, during the shift between two decades, the ideal 1950s to the unruly time of the 60s.  This is a time when the memories of Rosa Parks defying the Jim Crow Laws still were fresh while the gay population continued to be forced to the edge of society, as they were still considered mentally ill by the mental health profession.  In addition, in fear of repercussion and persecution, gay people sought to hide their sexual identity while living on the fringe of society.  This was something painfully close to Capote, as he jokingly hints toward the society's intolerance in his introduction scene where he tells a story in regards to the triple whammy combination of being a Jewish black homosexual in the South.<br /><br />The film never blatantly expresses the homophobic tendencies of the society.  Instead, the film presents subtle undercurrents swirling underneath the surface.  For example, Capote refers to his friend and author of To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), as his bodyguard while traveling to investigate the four murders in the small rural town of Holcomb, which hints towards his need of support in a small rural town.  In the town, the police detective Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) acts in a peculiarly odd manner when Capote is in his immediate presence.  The hotel clerk's face says more than a thousand words when he scrutinizes Capote.  And then there is the scene where Capote makes a little entrance with his newly acquired conservative outfit at the foyer of the local hotel where Capote and Harper stay, as his style of clothing is a little too extravagant for the little town.  The film is full of minute suggestions that indicate that people treat Capote differently compared to his straight counterparts.  One notion that should be pondered is his shield of fame that most gay people do not have, which helps him from overt assault.<br /><br />Capote deals with the stigma connected with his sexual orientation through self-discriminating jokes that break the social discomfort that his overtly exaggerated feminine mannerisms might generate.  He also completely exposes himself in an emotional and friendly manner by telling personal and affectionate stories about his upbringing and encounters he claims he had with people.  His openness exposes his vulnerabilities, and allows for people he approaches to drop their guard towards his homosexuality.  In the process, most people begin to find him interesting, and some even begin to like him, which serves very useful in the journalistic perspective as he seeks the motive to the Kansas murders . Empathically, Capote is highly aware of what he does, as he exploits people's weaknesses by manipulating them to his benefit by revealing his own limitation with his whiny unmanly (according to many alpha-males) voice.<br /><br />Even though this review points out some of the significance of the homophobia in the story, it is never the focal point.  The film instead portrays a tremendous multidimensional storyline that focuses on Capote's murder investigation for the New Yorker that eventually turns into his brilliant non-fiction literary work In Cold Blood.  However, it is an agonizing and eye-opening journey for Capote, as he seeks the motive to the four murders.  In the process, Capote gets to know the two murderers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), with whom he begins to empathize.  It becomes a classic sample of the Stockholm syndrome.  Maybe Capote connects with them, as he can relate to the social rejection and shame that these two murderers feel.  Yet, he struggles with understanding how they could have killed the Cuttler family.<br /><br />A major part of the film is Capote's lack of understanding in regards to the murders, which contrasts the difference between him and the killers.  Yet, he approaches them with sincere intentions while also being aware that he must manipulate them to learn the truth about the slayings.  The catch-22 for Capote rests in the notion that he wants to befriend them while exploiting their lives for personal fame and fortune.  In addition, he invests a lot of himself in the project that triggers severe emotional turmoil within him, as he has to deal with combination of emotions such as loathing, empathy, affection, and depression.<br /><br />Bennett Miller's directorial d&eacute;but in fiction film leaves the audience with a powerful cinematic experience that shakes and stirs the audience from beginning to end.  Much of the success of the story also rests within Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance that must be the best male performance in the theaters in 2005 with Matt Dillon's performance in Crash (2004) close behind.  It should be mentioned that it is not Hoffman's first performance as a gay man, as similar performances were made in Boogie Nights (1997) and Flawless (1999).  However, in Capote he transcends his performance far beyond the notion of sexual orientation.<br /><br />The vision that the director Miller has in Capote emerges through the meticulous and stunningly poignant capturing of each scene.  The camerawork helps accentuate the uniqueness of each situation, which previously was described in the strong use of contrasting concepts and symbols.  It offers an artistic freedom for the audience to freely interpret the situation while also suggestively pointing the audience in a direction.  This is not to forget the well-timed script that does not miss a beat in its lines and pauses.  Lastly, the vast number of different contextual concepts in the film presents a rather complex film that blends strong emotions with several large issuesthat offer the audience several ideas to cerebrally wrestle with, as similar issues are often raised in our contemporary society on a frequent basis.ve killed the Cuttler family. <br /> <br />A major part of the film is Capote's lack of understanding in regards to the murders, which contrasts the difference between him and the killers.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made.  You owe it to yourself to listen to it.  Granted, I'm a Radiohead fan, but this is the album I start with when I go to convert my friends.
0156027321|1.0|This book is sooooooo boring, I can't believe I paid money for it and then read over a 100 pages of it before deciding that I have better things to do with my time, like watch TV! I'm an avid reader and have an appreciation for books of different genres but this was just disappointing. What's the big deal about a boy and a tiger living in harmony on a boat? I read the amazon reviews and seeing that it got mostly 5 stars, I decided to buy it. Horrible decision! I usually keep books in my library that I've read and enjoyed, but this one's going right back on the market! Complete waste of time...Ugghhh!
0385720920|5.0|\\"Choke,\\" by Chuck Palahniuk is one of the most unique novels I have ever read.  From the first page which implores the reader not to read the book (who does that?) to the surprise ending, the novel was a great read from start to finish.<br /><br />The main character, Victor Mancini, is many things, a con artist preying on other's sympathy, a med-school dropout, an \\"actor\\" in a colonial-era theme park, a sex addict, a loving and caring son trying to take care of his mother suffering from Alzheimer's disease, as well as a descendant of Jesus Christ, or perhaps Jesus Christ himself.  The other characters in the book are just as demented.<br /><br />The writing style is clear and even the flashbacks to Victor's childhood are not intrusive to the story, but rather enlightening to where Victor is in his life at that moment.<br /><br />This is my first Palahniuk novel, but I am anxious to read his other novels as well.  This book is well worth the time and money.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Aside from being one of the worst singers on the planet, Madonna's new cd proves once again that this aging star has no talent whatsoever.  Wasn't it bad enough when she tried to remake \\"American Pie?\\" Now we listen to her use someone elses music to her lousy lyrics.  The music is horrible but Im not surprised because the artist is horrible.
0553801503|1.0|This book was a dissapointing failure. <br /> <br />I was a huge fan of the previous 3 novels and really anticipated this one.  After all the delays and given the long time the author worked on it, it just had to be good, right? <br /> <br />Guess not. <br /> <br />Many of the strongest characters in the series are not even present.  The story line is langid and uninteresting.  Minor characters are pushed to the front and we are forced to accompany them on circuitous errands.   <br /> <br />The overarching series plot, which galloped in the previous three novels, has practically frozen to a standstill.  I wish his publisher had burned the thing and told him he needed to start over.  <br /> <br />It has all the reek of being churned out.  Hope the next one saves the series.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|I'm actually listening to this CD as I type this, and I'm not even really sure how to put this into words. I haven't kept up on Korn in the last couple years, frankly I've never been a big fan, however the one thing I will give them is that they had originality. Bands had done the rap-rock thing before (RHCP, Faith No More, etc.) but there was no one that sounded like Korn. I can remember hearing the \\"Freaking B\\" remix of Freak on a Leash with Jon just scatting on the beginning, it was great. Now however, he seems to feel the need to sing, and that I don't care for. <br /> <br />Korn always worked best as what they are, a bunch of guys who can play loud, fast music with a singer who can scream and put some real emotion into, however, this new CD appears to be none of the above. I hate to say this, but they sound like any other band on the radio, just with Jon Davis singing. I'm all for bands growing, the Beatles changed directions more times than any band I can think of. However they always stayed true to themselves, they progressed, but never pushed things. Korn has tried to fit more into the mainstream. Maybe this is intentional, maybe it's the fact that some of these guys have to be pushing 40, but I just don't feel it anymore. <br /> <br />There are some interesting songs on here (I say that after I rip it apart above). Hypocrites has that deep guitar sound of the days of yore, and actually Tearjerker is a big departure, but I kinda like it (like Roulette for System of a Down). But overall, this is just noise, there's no intricacies to the songs anymore, they're all just cookie-cutter. You know, many fans will read this review and be upset, and you have every right to be, but I've been listening to Korn (through my brother) for 10 years or so, I've almost been brought to tears by \\"Daddy\\", I've danced to \\"Freak on a Leash\\" and I've scatted to \\"Twist\\", but this one leaves me feeling empty. If you liked the new Papa Roach CD, especially \\"Scars\\" you'll probably likethis, but if you're looking at this is an old Korn CD (or if you were looking for a  new Limp Bizkit to sound like Counterfeit), pass this one up. <br /> <br />PS, where's the bagpipes?
B00008DDXL|3.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets <br /> <br />The film begins with young Harry being oppressed by his step-parents: they want to control his life!!! Harry wants to run around with his friends (who are driving without a license). This film panders to teenagers by portraying parents as stupid, when in fact it is teenagers who are ignorant of the dangers that can occur in the real world. The computer generated images are better than in the previous film; full of sound and fury to accompany meaningless action. Special effects are not a substitute for a good story. The British class system is alive and well in Warthogs; the \\"mudbloods\\" are kept in their place. (Or is the gender discrimination experienced by the author?) <br /> <br />The interpersonal conflicts between Harry and Malfoy lead to a duel before the school. Then Harry finds a petrified student (\\"stone drunk\\"?) There is a trick where they change shapes and acquire information not meant for them. Someone vandalizes Harry's room and steals a diary. Then Hermione becomes another petrified student (from boredom?). Haggrid becomes a suspect, Harry visits the monster spider deep in the woods. The magic car allows them to escape. The teacher expected to act against the danger tries to run away. [This teaches children to not believe the stories they are told.] <br /> <br />The Secret Chamber is found by magic, and boys leap to discover the secrets. The secret of the villain is revealed. Harry fights and kills a giant snake! There is a final confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who dies by magic. This story seems weak and confuse. Those who enjoyed it can have their viewpoint. [This film seems to have more British expressions than in the earlier film.] <br /> <br />
0446525537|5.0|Grab a box of tissues and let yourself be taken away to the story of two young teenagers finding meaning in their lives through one another.  A modest, spiritual Jamie Sullivan feels confident about herself, but wishes others would take the time to understand her.  A popular, self-centered Landon Carter feels insecure with himself, but enjoys being on top and above everyone else.  When Landon reluctantly asks Jaime to the homecoming dance because he does not want to be the only one without a date, he did not expect her to change his life.   <br /> The two teenagers complete one another.  Jamie needed someone to love her and reassure her while Landon needed someone to put life in perspective.  They fall in love and together they overcome physical and mental sufferings.  As Landon tells Jaime, \\"You're beautiful, you're kind, you're gentle... you're everything that I'd like to be,\\" which is exactly what Landon was searching for all along, meaning in his life.  <br /> When you think everything is going perfectly in their relationship, Nicholas Sparks gives them a challenge.  The journey they take while trying to overcome this barrier strengthens their love for one another.  At the end of the book, you are left with mixed feelings of sadness and the sense of everlasting love.  This book is sure to touch all of its readers in a special way. <br />

B000BMSTMS|5.0|This is a short simple review of Korn's \\"See You On The Other Side.\\"  My goal is not comparison, or to say why any other reviewer is right or wrong.  This album came out almost 30 days after I got sober.  The title of the album says it all, and I feel like I know what they were going through when they made this album.  It's not a suprise that it doesn't sound like any of the other albums, it isn't any of the other albums.  Anyway, please, don't read reviews before you buy this album.  I think the story it tells, and the maturation evidenced from album to album to end up with \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is amazing.  I have not taken the album out yet, I keep listening over and over again, finding new things I like every time.  For now the highlight and the most applicable to my own life part of the album is the finale of \\"Seen it All\\" and \\"Tear Jerker.\\"  The album speaks to me, I hope it speaks to you too.
1576751988|5.0|Read this book, overcome stalls and procrastination and reach allof your goals. I like the format of this book, east to read, easy to carry with you. Great on audio as well. I play it my car all the time. <br /> <br />Thank you Brian.
B00005JOHI|2.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan rather than a Pride and Prejudice fan steer clear of the film.<br /><br />The film does have it merits such as Knightley's performance and the first propsal scence.<br /><br />The problem with the film is the liberties that screenwriter and director have taken. Proper decorum and standards of that time period are not observed. The interaction between characters have much more modern sensibilities than that of Austen's 19th century work. Additionaly hair styles and costumes where not of the correct time period as well. Even those who have not read the book but enjoy period dramas will find this annoying.<br /><br />There are mistakes in relationships between characters. Additionally scence and interactions towards the end are completely changed from the book. Also in general the time frame. Pride and Prejudice took place over 18 months.<br /><br />The relationship between Darcy and Wickham was never fully explained and I had to explain to others the full extent of that relationship.<br /><br />The biggest problem for this purist is the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet is not fully built. One of the key points of this relationship is built during the days at Pemberly and when Lizzy gets the letter from Jane. We do not see the relationship build at Pemberly. But the worst part is that when she gets the letters from Jane and tells Darcy the Aunt and Uncle are present.<br /><br />This is the moment in the book where you see the most tenderness from Darcy and in this movie it is interupted by other relations being present.<br /><br />Overall it is entertaining for those who have not read the book and a fun diversion. If your a purist the fun would be in spotting the numerious mistake that are made.
B000BB1MHS|5.0|OK, I liked the 71 spin on Dahl's cautionary, confectionary tale, but compared to this cinematic feast for the eyes and ears, the Wilder vehicle pales in comparison. Wilder's Mr. Rogers-like manner and the nursery rhyme-like Oompa-Loompa chants about guzzling sweets the way an elephant eats, that film is more for the single digit age groups, in my opinion, while this sweet dark fantasy helmed by Tim Burton is for the kid in everyone, and the brilliant visuals and infectious music will bring out the tousle-haired, freckle-nosed, chocolate-smeared Tommy, Dickie, or Carlito residing in the heart of every Tom, Dick, and Carlos.<br /><br />  I liked Johnny Depp's sadistic, sarcastic, child-loathing portrayal of Roald Dahl's literary bombonero (\\"candymaker\\" in Spanish) far better than Wilder's interpretation of the character as a confectionary Captain Kangaroo, and the whole part about Wonka's boyhood and his unpaternal dentist father was a nice touch.<br /><br />  And don't get me started on the MUSIC. Brilliant compositions by the extremely talented Mister Daniel Elfman, and the Oompa-Loompa songs, sung by the man himself, harkened back to my 80s teenhood with their sound reminiscent of Elfman's new-wave band Oingo Boingo.<br /><br />  Definitely a must-see for young, old, and everyone in between.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was by far the best movie of 2005.  It's only such a shame that the movie didn't do better in the theaters.  And what a ridiculously low price for such awesome entertainment!  Anyone who is thinking about buying this movie should.  I, along with many many other people, am holding out hope in my heart that incredible DVD sales of the movie and series will bring it back to tv for another, much longer run!  Please support Firefly/Serenity and buy this DVD!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I only recently learned about Firefly with the release of the movie, Serenity.  We saw the movie first and loved it.  We were hooked from when we walked out of the theater the first time.  We went out and bought the show on DVD and began watching it.  About halfway through the series, we couldn't resist and went back to the movie.  We loved it even more the second time.  After finishing the series on DVD, we went back to the movie a third time.  If we hadn't been in the middle of a move, we would've seen it more and we aren't the types to see movies over and over in the theater.  Firefly and Serenity are just that good.  Since the movie has left theaters, we've just been watching the tv show over and over again.  To anyone thinking about getting this - do it.  And to any network execs thinking about bringing back Firefly - do it!  There's a built-in fan-base now, take advantage of it!  Just look at all these reviews on Amazon.com!

B000BMSTMS|2.0|I've been a Korn fan since day one. There first cd is there best...yadayadayada....but every one of their cd's beyond that was really good in there own way. I loved Take a Look in the Mirros. Now everyone is praising them because their \\"reinventing\\" there sound..pssh...yah...that's great if it sounds good. This sounds like s*it...pure and simple. <br /> <br />Aside from maybe 4 songs on this album, the rest was pure-filler. I've listened to it like 4 times, trying to perhaps gain a greater sense of respect for it. But eh-eh...not happening...and to say that i'm giving it a s*itty review because it's not as heavy as there other stuff is wrong. I actually thought tearjerker was one of, if not the best song on the album. Very dissapointing.
6305807930|4.0|Well as most of you already know, you don't watch Dario Argento's movies for substance. You watch them for style. This movie delivers with bright vibrant colors and imagery, hooded figures, devils, beautiful women, and a really mean hot dog vendor. I find myself drawn to watch this movie over and over again, if only for the neon lit rooms and underwater lairs,Argento has displayed throughout.  <br /> <br />The plot, involving a brothers search for his missing sister in a house of evil, is a follow up to Argento's Suspiria(another much lauded film) that follows the tale of the three sisters( a witch cult or something even more sinister-of course never fully explained)  <br /> <br />If it's explanation your looking for, go elsewhere, but if your looking to be entertained by vivid kills and unusual set pieces,you might just want to set up shop in the House of Inferno.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I know a lot of Darkness fans like the band simply for the fact that they rock.  It's as simple as that.  They've managed to put balls back into rock and the music on their first album was as raunchy and hard-rockin' as any other album to ever come out.  \\"Permission to Land\\" is in my top 5 rock albums.  I love it to death.  That being said, should I really have expected their next album to be a copy of the first; slinging out the same stuff?  I think \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back\\" is just as good as their first album, but for different reasons.  Yes, it does lack the rawness of their first album, but although we already knew these guys were talented, this album has showed the world that their talent is limitless.  The Beatles and the Rolling Stones used the sitar.  Why is it that the Darkness are overproduced because they've used a sitar?  If you know anything about music, you would know that British rock typically tends to be heavily produced.  Is this a surprise here?  It's one of the things that makes British rock both great and different.  I think \\"Permission to Land\\" showed us the band's raw talent and \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back\\" has showed us the band's limitless depth.  It's different, I'll give you that, but the Darkness are still as good as they've ever been and you should expect them to be around for a while simply for the fact that they pump out great rock music.  The music on this album is simply hi-grade great quality rock and roll.  And you'll have fun listening to it, too.

The only draw back in my opinion is that each card has a small copyright on the lower right corner and they are published by a company called US Games but the deck is printed in China.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|WTF?? this cant be happening! what the hell is going on with korn? heavy metal bands have started to sell out or quit at an alarming rate! korn is the most recent sell out! i never thought korn would sell out, but i was painfully wrong. for the record, i have loved all six of korn's records. and for the record, i have waited almost three years for this piece of s**t record!!!!!! this record sounds like a pop album. and brian's absence is extremely noticable. korn is sadly dead and there is nothing i can do about it. i noticed that korn was taking a big risk with take a look in the mirror. it was still good, but it was falling away from what korn was and will never be again. if jon reads these reviews, i hope he gets to this one!!! what the hell is wrong with you??? since when did you become a pop star??? i'm sorry i wasted my money on such a record! ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS RECORD IS A FAN OF POP MUSIC!! THEY ARE NOT HEAVY METAL FANS!!!!       R.I.P. KORN!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Topping the billboard charts again for the forth time this week with her brand new album the Emancipation of Mimi. Mariah Carey is back and now better than ever. It was once believed that she had left the music business because of the lengthy gap between her last albums. However, with her exceptional voice and soothing high pitches brought her back and allowed her to create \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\", both of which have hit number one on the charts. I rate it five stars.
B000B0WODA|4.0|My first impressions of this album were that it reminded me of the first. The lyrics, the riffs, and the overall feeling was very similar to their debut. But as I continued to listen, and attend their performance at the Paramount, the new songs stood out as something completely new. This album has darker lyrics, written over a danceable track. The gems lie hidden amongst those deemed as single material. This boy has positive connotation for me, as I remember it as their opener for a stellar live performance. But my two favorite are \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving\\" and \\"Outsiders\\". Leaving has never recieved much recognition by other critics, but I believe it to be the pinnacle of this album. It draws on much of what the last album stood for, but has taken it to the next level. Critics have also called outsiders a horrible way to end an otherwise allright album. But I believe it to be an excellent ending. It epitomizes my earlier statement of being dark in words but light in tone. The bass feels funky and the guitar sounds as if it came directly from New Wave 80's. I gave this album four stars because it reminds me of too much of thier debut, but in a way this a good thing. They have found their niche and have expanded upon an excellent sound.
0064407667|5.0|I had never read any book like this. It isn't a feel good book. It is a real page turner.  It was like a \\"car accident\\". You don't want to look because it is bad but you just can't turn away.  I kept wanting to put the book down.. but I just couldn't. I just had to find out what was going to happen next.  Overall, I think it is truly worth the read and very well written.
0060899190|5.0|I read select postcard secrets out loud to a group of friends.  Some of the secrets were hilariously funny. Others were very disturbing in that they revealed, long-held secrets of various abuses by and toward others, and the resulting expressions of anger, regret, guilt and sadness appeared all too often throughout the book.  The boldness of people reaching out through this medium made me read their secrets with some measure of trepidation.  No doubt, many readers will recognize themselves, their desires and longings, in the postcard writings.  This visually-stimulating book should be a wake up call to everyone, that emotional mental health issues are inadequately addressed in our culture.  The book is one step towards affirming that it's a positive and healing thing to get one's hidden issues \\"out there\\" and hopefully, examined.  I don't get what all the fuss is over the layout.  Maybe a larger size or format would have looked better, but then the book would've been more cumbersome to transport.  The size is comfortably practical and the layout is fine, especially also since the postcards were grouped together with common themes.  Works for me.
014028009X|5.0|I love the way Helen Fielding captured the range of emotions and thoughts in this book. There is something that you will read and think \\"oh, yea, I remember when I felt that way\\" or \\"oh, yea, I remember when I thought that\\".  It is well written and a real page turner.  I read it in 2 sittings.
B0007IPBD6|5.0|This really is a great CD...there's nothing like Damien live.  But I literally bought this on ebay a few years ago for around 8 dollars.  If you can pick this up for a reasonable price...I would highly recommend it.  B-sides is also a good choice for those interested in a few songs that aren't on \\"O\\".
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Last February, when founding guiarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch announced he was leaving Korn to get closer with God, you knew things would never be the same. Afterall, the group recorded six full albums under the same line-up, and having just one member absent has a butterfly effect on Korn's music. The first listen to Korn's seventh studio album, \\"See You On The Other Side,\\" is quite a bizarre one. This definitely isn't the same Korn that guided me through high school. Gone are the chunky guitar riffs and Jonathan's angst-ridden growl. Make no mistake, this is still Korn, but a lot has changed.<br /><br />Aside from everything you already knew (the exit of Head, the new record deal, the producers) the sound and style of this album is the biggest shocker. The sound is decidely less guitar heavy than 2003's \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" (perhaps a reaction/effect from Head's departure) and instead opts for an effects heavy, near industrial experience (think Korn as produced by Trent Reznor). The style of Jonathan's vocals and lyrics is probably the biggest difference though. After six albums where the man vented all of his frustrations, hurts and insecurities, Davis finally finds new things to sing about. He still covers some familiar topics (i.e. kinky sex), but there is much less complaining, which is definitely a plus.<br /><br />Musically, this album picks up almost where 2002's \\"Untouchables\\" left off, which makes \\"Take A Look In The Mirror,\\" an album that attempted to recapture Korn's past glories, seem really out of place. However, this album sounds a lot more confident than \\"Untouchables,\\" which is probably due to the fact that Korn didn't have a record deal at the time of recording, which means they got to do whatever they wanted to. Songs like \\"Politics,\\" \\"Hypocrites\\" and \\"Liar\\" were obviously crafted to please the die-hard fan and at the same time,  still injecting a new flavor, while \\"Coming Undone\\" is destined to become a Korn concert classic (Sorry, I refused to type that last part with K's instead of C's). The more experimental tracks like \\"Throw Me Away,\\" \\"Seen It All,\\" and the overly emotional, appropriately titled album closer, \\"Tearjerker\\" represent to the fullest extent, what Korn should and do sound like in 2005. \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Open Up\\" finally have Korn recognizing their 80's influences (Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, The Cure) and completely belong to Jonathan, with his signature crooning.  It's worth noting that these songs sound remarkably similar to Jonathan's contributions to the \\"Queen Of The Damned\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />The bonus disc that comes with this deluxe version (trust me, this is the version you need) is very generous with three excellent b-sides: \\"It's Me Again,\\" \\"Eaten Up Inside\\" and \\"Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Morte)\\" and two remixes of the ultra-catchy single, \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" that are admittedly less exciting (but when are they not)? Overall, \\"See You On the Other Side\\" is an album that the open minded Korn fan will be completely satisfied with. However, the reaction from the meat-head, mosh-pit dwelling fans is one that we can easily spot miles away. \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is the line in the sand. If you have been following Korn this long, and are brave enough to follow them into more musical experimentations, then this album will keep your faith. If, however, you are still stuck in 1994, you will be left in the dust.used to type that last part with K's instead of C's).

0316666343|5.0|This book was just one of those books that kept you interested.  I laughed, cried, loved, and hated all within these pages.  It was written in the point of view of the young girl (suzie) who had her life violently stolen from her.  She shows you the coping journey of those who meant a lot to her.  There is even a \\"Ghost\\"-like scene in the book that helps kind of ease the sadness you feel for her shortened life.  I strongly reccommend this book to you all.

B000002KHH|5.0|Ever since i got this, Black Sabbath has been my favorite band. This CD has so much to offer, and I think that any fan of music will enjoy it. First of all, there is the awesome, timeless classic War Pigs. I LOVE THIS SONG! This is one of my favorite songs ever! Ozzy's vocals are amazing! Don't ever let anyone tell you that Ozzy can't sing. This song is proof that he can and he does! <br />The second song on this CD is Paranoid. Not my favorite, but still pretty good. After that is Planet Caravan. I have heard a lot of people talk about this song, and most people i know hate it. Probably because it is a very experimental song (Black sabbath did that a lot). Song 4 is the ever popular Iron man! I love this song too, but I don't think it should have got so much publicity as opposed to other Black sabbath songs. At one point, I listened to this song every day for a month! Then, I heard it through a high quality stereo system. I turned it up so loud, that the windows were rattling! After it was over, I was shaking really hard! It was almost like having ADHD. Later, I learned that this effect is called Psycho-acoustics. Also, That percussion in this song is great too. Next is my second favorite song on this cd, Electric Funeral! This song is so awesome! I love everything about it! The riff is amazing! After that is Hand of Doom. This song is sort of strange, and it has a soft bluesy beat to it in the beginning. The message is very atypical of Black Sabbath, since it seems to be anti-drug (a strong contrast to songs like sweet leaf and snowblind) I love it no matter what the message is. After that, we have Rat salad. This song is purely instrumental, and has some of Bill Ward's finest work ever. The last song on this CD Is Faeries Wear Boots. The whole thing is just about a drug trip, but the song is still pretty good. <br />This CD is so good it makes me want to cry! Anyone who appreciates good music must have it. While I don't think it's the definitive album for Black sabbath (I like Master of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath better, I do think that it's some of their best! If you like this cd, then you'll love Master of Reality, Sabbath bloody Sabbath, and Black Sabbath Volume 4!

630542845X|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and thought it was okay. . . but not particularly spectacular.  I saw it again on cable a couple of weeks ago and was moved to tears. The movie speaks of things I have learned for myself over the last couple of years . . . we are all connected, respect for all forms of life . . . and drove it home.  Some of the reviews I read focused on the part in the movie where Powder is watching the guy in the bathroom but I'd guess those folks had their own issues with sexuality.  If you pay closer attention to what is transpiring in that scene you will realize Powder is not admiring the guys body, he's admiring his HAIR!  Watch the movie again and you will see what I'm talking about.  Anyway, those who don't enjoy this movie aren't quite ready for what it has to say.  Give it time, you'll get there.

0020442203|5.0|I can't even begin to say how many times I've read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or the other books in the Narnia series.  I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.<br /><br />\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door.  Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure.  When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.<br /><br />For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange.  Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams.  Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them.  How many adventures they have taken readers on, and will continue to do so for generations to come.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd album, by far.  The three middle songs, allegorically describing humans in terms of pigs, dogs, and sheep, are uncompromisingly and relentlessly cynical (some reviewers on here slant this toward a leftist view, but the words can be applied to ALL those who abuse positions of power, and those who let themselves be taken advantage of; left, right and center are equally guilty of this).  Yet all are wonderfully arranged, with Gilmour's angry yet beautiful guitar a particular high point. <br /> <br />All the cynicism could be overwhelming to some, but don't give up.  The bleak nature of the middle three songs are redeemed by the final, short cut - hopeful lyrics over straight-forward acoustic guitar, showing that there can be hope, and redemption can be found in simply caring for your fellow man.  In the hands of a lesser band, this could be a very hokey ending, but Pink Floyd manage to pull it off.

B000A5044C|5.0|\\"Dare mo shiranai\\" (Nobody Knows) by Kore-eda Hirokazu is all the more poignant for being based on a real-life scandal in Japan. In 1988, four children were found abandoned by their mother, living for six months in a squalid Tokyo apartment with no running water, electricity, or food, where one of the children, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed.<br /><br />As the film begins, the family is moving into yet another apartment; they are continuously evicted for having too many children. The two youngest children arrive smuggled in suitcases, already a sign of the startling neglect to come, as the mother portrays this as a game. The hot, tired children unfold from their suitcase prisons as the mother laughs, claps her hands and tells them \\"Good job!\\" in her Minnie Mouse voice. The children's flighty mother is barely more than a child herself, unable to cope with real life and care for her large brood (each child has a different father).<br /><br />It is never explicitly stated what her job is, but she frequently leaves the children for long stretches of time, expecting eldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) to care for ten-year-old Kyoko, seven-year-old Shigeru, and five-year-old Yuki. The children are like children everywhere: they long to play outside, be rambunctious, play in the park, be free to dream. Instead, they are virtual prisoners, unable to leave the apartment lest they be caught. Even the small balcony is off limits. Akira does all of the outside shopping, bill paying, and cooking. None of the children go to school. \\"Why do you want to go to school?\\" their mother asks. \\"Famous people don't go to school.\\" Like who? Akira demands. His mother can't come up with a suitable answer.<br /><br />The inevitable happens: their mother is infatuated with the latest boyfriend, and skips town for good. Akira holds off telling the other children for as long as possible; after all, their mother is frequently gone for months at a time. He is forced to spend down, but it isn't enough. The utilities are eventually cut off, and the apartment descends into a pit of hell, with garbage covering everything. The children must use the bathroom in the park and wash their clothes in a fountain, and survive off of leftover sushi handouts. Akira falls in with a group of thug-like high schoolers who use him, taunt him, and try to get him to shoplift, and the youngest children suffer the most. Somber Kyoko taps out melodies on her toy piano, Shigeru breaks the rules by running wild outside, and Yuki colors and draws pictures that cover every inch of the apartment. Their situation becomes more and more dire; even though the landlord's wife has seen the state of the apartment, no social services are called in. The children are left to fester as their clothes unravel and they slowly succumb to malnutrition. An accident occurs, prompted out of boredom, that changes their close-knit lives. The ending is sparse, haunting, and we are not told what becomes of the children, or if their mother was ever found.<br /><br />The child actors were essentially filmed living in the apartment throughout an entire year of filming, so in some ways, \\"Nobody Knows\\" plays out like a documentary. The scene where they play in the park for the first time was really their first time leaving the apartment in months. It is heartwrenching to watch them spying on \\"normal\\" children down below, children who take school for granted, are allowed to ride bikes and play in the park. There is no creative outlet, no exercise, no nourishing food, and yet, although weakened, their spirits still demonstrate the resilience of childhood. Kore-eda's haunting portrait of solitude and survival at its darkest is difficult to watch, but worth the journey.own, but it isn't enough.

B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic.  It is so perfect and exciting movie.  For the story, it talks about Brad Pitt (John Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) is a couple that have been married for 6 years and things appear to be normal. But it appears that things are changing, they might be in trouble.  So, they are seeing a marriage counselor. However, nobody including themselves knows is that they are professional assassins. However, they are both assigned by their employers to kill the same person. When they each try to take out the target, they get in each other's way and blow the job. Now they are told to go after the person who made them miss the target. And when they learn about each other, they try to take each other out.  After that, they get back each other and decide to get rid of their enemies in the end.  For the story, it is quite perfect.  It is well written.  For the acting, all of them are so good.  For Brad Pitt, he has his very cool acting attitude like usual.  This movie is no exception.  So, when he appears in every movie that I watched, he never disappoints me.  For Angelina Jolie, she is actually quite a very good actress.  For this movie, she is the bomb as well as Brad Pitt.  For the direction, it is going well in this movie.  It has no doubt about it.  For the visuals, it is very good.  The scene of Angelina Jolie jumps off from the roof in the building.  It is fantastic.  The scene of the house-explosion scene in the middle, it is good.  Also, the scene of the final explosive battle in the store during the night, it is absolutely fantastic too.  So, the visuals are very good from head to toe.  For the music, it is very good and has a very exciting feeling.  For the sound effects, it is very tense between scenes to scenes.  Also, not only mention a lot of action scenes in this movie, the love scenes between Brad and Angelina are very good.  For example, the scene when they first met in Columbia.  It was so romantic for me.  This movie is so much fun.  It does filled with action and romance.  It is one of the best 2005 summer movie.so much fun.  It does filled with action and romance.

B0002858YS|5.0|When you first hear this album it takes you to a new level and is certainly very original. Their music is a fusion of 80's rock, glam and modern alternative rock. They have a style that has long been awaited as we have lately been drowned in the unoriginal tides of music by talentless artists. The Killers give us hope that new bands will emerge with brilliant and original tunes. A superb debut and what I believe will be identified as a classic in years to come. Tracks like \\"Andy you're a star\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" are my personal favourites.

B000000XB9|5.0|Music is Back <br /> \\" Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm, I know; it's been coming for some time,\\" as John Fogerty once said in one of his many songs. Credence Clearwater Revival listed their greatest hits in one cd, which was called Chronicle Volume 1. This release has succeeded in the past; it might have a tremendous impact with all the fans. <br /> This rock and roll CD has numerous songs that made history during the 60's and 70's. Even though these songs are old they have never gone out of style. The way in which the songwriter composed the songs, using new techniques makes it hard to classify them as \\"old.\\" Credence was often compared to other big groups such as The Beetles and the Rolling Stones. This cd completes all the requests from fans and they are always looking for good quality. Their music continues to influence today's youth because older music is returning and is sometimes used in films. <br /> The way in which they played the guitar and the way the vocalist showed his dedication in his songs made me feel like  a watching them live. Their songs made me remember my childhood and everything that was happening to me as I was growing up. After listening to them over and over again I felt as if I could relate to them and their songs. It gave me a sense of confidence and comfort when I listened to their lyrics. I feel a bigger connection with them because they transmit more emotions than any other group under the same genre. <br /> One of the songs that works the best is \\"Have you ever seen the rain;\\" this song makes me remember the things that were going on around me. There's a specific line in the song that gives me hope to go on when I'm having problems: \\"When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day,\\" shows that there is always a better day. The song Up around the bend lets a person's imagination fly to a different world. \\"Fix your mind on a crystal day, always time for a good conversation, there'san ear for what you say.\\" \\"We are going up around the bend.\\" <br /> The track that least grabbed my attention was \\"Dj Vu\\" (all over again), because it's not a song that I expected from the songwriter. Perhaps something more is missing in order for it to appeal more to me. The song was more complicated to understand because it lacked examples of what he was feeling or what things he had already experienced. \\"Day by day I hear the voices rising, started by a whisper like it did before: day by day we count the dead and dying, ship the bodies home while the networks all keep score,\\" this song is not clear to what situation he is referring to, which makes it harder to understand. And the song is very confusing with the words that he decided to use. <br /> The people who will buy this cd are those who are true fans of rock and roll and the history that Credence has given in many of their releases. I am one of those fans that found all of the songs very pleasing with all the good work in this material. My prediction is that their music will live forever because it's the history of many people and they will be here to stay today and tomorrow. <br /> Many people have said, \\" This collection is as golden as golden can be - brilliant , emotionally captivating songs infused with gritty soul that have not merely survived the decades but shine as brightly now as in the late 60s and 70s. This is the most authentic rock 'n roll you'll ever get.\\" they will soon be ready for their new release. A lot of their fans will continue to love their music and make lots of noise just like today. The audience and all the true fans will expand their music to many places. And they will make it grow in every single place on earth.     <br />     <br /> <br />
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I think that this album is kind of weak. Korn lost there unique sound. Now there are mostly replaced by keyboards and other things. I think that \\"Head\\" should come back and put Korn back on the right track(the way they were before this album). But other than this being there weakest album yet Korn is still the best. And for people that gave this album an 5, stick to your pop (stupid) music, this music is not for you people.     Through Me Away - is one of the better songs on the album.
076790592X|5.0|The Last Thesis <br /> <br /> \\"My friends , assume you are all here for the social Psychology Class. I have been teaching this course for twenty years, and this is the first time I can say there is a risk in taking it, because I have a fatal illness\\". (album 9). Tuesdays with Morrie deserves to be rated as one of the greatest books with a five- start rating of excellence. The courage was the strength that an old man had to live even with his sickness, however there was a point where Mitch only talked about Morrie and did not explain anything about his wife and the life that they had together. This book will be appeal most to teenagers because they can benefit from reading this book as a good way to see life and be more appreciated of they have. <br /> Morrie seemed to very fond of his friends and spent time with them-- helping them to solve their problems. The way that he saw the meaning of life was to devote himself to loving others and devoting to create something that gives him purpose and meaning of life. He was very appreciative of nature and his perfect day would be with spending time with his friends. He did not want any to be upset because he was dying, he wanted everyone to be happy. He fought his illness by giving classes and giving his students the option to continue taking the class or leaving it because he did not knoe if he would be able to finish the semester with them. <br /> One of the weakness of this book is that Mitch did not try harder to mention Morrie's relationship with his wife. Mitch did not explain how Charlotte was affected by her husband's illness. Even thought she kept to herself it would have been better if those emotions were described by Morrie. I don't feel disappointment from reading this book, but will be better if some of the questions or the opinions  given were answered. Otherwise Mitch report will seem like he forgot or he did not complete his review about Morrie in this book.          <br /> Many people will find a lot of things at this book that will benificiate their lives by adding different values. This book shows how an old man can touch other peoples heart just by reading his article. It is very detailed and gives a lot of examples of how a person can deal with the everyday life. This book it is incredible from the bottom to the top because demonstrates so much appreciation of been alive, value your family and what nature has to offer. <br />  This book will appeal to most age groups because is a way to learn how to be a nice and generous person.  Various readers have highly recommended this book because the message that is sent to all the readers. Even though Morrie had a terminal illness, he had the courage to overcome the pain that he was going through and at the same time he was giving those around him love and advice. <br /> <br /> <br />
0671027344|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower is am awesome book. It is a great story about a boy in highschool. Its full of drama, love, and trouble. The author explains the boys feelings so well that you feel like you are him. I sugest this book to high schoolers, almost any high school student can relate to this book some how, I know i did alot. I hope he comes out with a sequel. This is a book I would read more than once.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Korn needs to give it up. Ive been a fan since the start and this album just sucks! I guess having Lil jon or whatever his name is on the music video just insults true metal and rock fans. Rap artists need to stay away from Rock music! And I don't blame Head for getting the hell out of there. Jonathan Davis has driven Korn into the ground. I thought Untouchables and Take a Look in the Mirror sucked as is. But, after hearing this garbage they almost sound good. Horrible lyrics and \\"un\\"heavy guitar makes it worthy for the incinerator. If your luckly one song might appeal to you, and if your a true fan you'll know which one. And its not that Twisted Transistor bullsh@t! Im sorry to say Korns dead, I hope I never have to see them again On the Other Side.
6305388458|5.0|On the same day that Jesus Christ was born, another miracle took place, just next door! The birth of Brian. However, the wise men didn't quite think that he was as extraordinary as his neighbor. From here on in begins THE LIFE OF BRIAN, the third film from the genius' of MONTY PYTHON. I think this movie is just as good as Holy Grail, with countless hillarious gags throughout. \\"Why do you want to be a woman Stan?\\"<br />If you have never seen a Monty Python movie before, you may be wise to see HOLY GRAIL first, it IS the all time classic. This movie follows more of a straight plot (although straight is probably not the best word) than the other PYTHON movies. Brian is the central character, and he decides to join The PFJ, (The Peolpes Front of Judia) in order to rebel against the Romans. During a raid Brian is almost captured by the Romans but escapes only to become involved with a horde of people who think that he is the Messiah. This of course leads to his getting crucified and eventually a wonderful song sang by Eric Idle and a bunch of crucifees called ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE. A ton of stuff happens along the way, and the Python cast as always plays dozens of zany characters. You will surely have a good time watching this one. \\"I dont care... and I want to make this ABSOLUTELY clear.... even if they do say JEHOVAH!\\"<br /><br />Oh yeah, just so you can't say I didn't warn you, there is a show all naked scene.  I know I'm usually into that sort of thing but it really isn't that cool here.
B000069CWE|5.0|Guest MCs & singers only add to the 'feel' of the original versions. Re-mixes here are better b/c they're longer songs, more enjoyable. Bennington's vocals are angelic in My DcembR and Aaron Lewis makes Krwling more dramatic.
B00005B36H|2.0|Yep, fraid so...When I first saw tool I was impressed. They seemed to be offering something new, dynamic and impressive.   <br />But really, there are only so many mysterious songs about taking it in the arse you can write before you bore your audience silly.   <br /> <br />A few albums down the track I'm bored. If you've never heard tool much and like their sound, give yourself a couple of albums before finding something else to get into...these guys are too much of a one trick pony.  Sad to say, but true.
0345350499|5.0|This has to be my favorite book I have ever read. I have read it so many times that it is falling apart. The depth and movement of the story is amazing. It is long and rich with detail, which I love because it does not end too quickly. Even as long as it is, you will be despairing that it is ending! Beware. This book will keep you up till 3:30 in the morning!
B000CQC848|4.0|The people who sell this Limited Edition CD online are RIPPING YOU OFF. <br /> <br />This is only $7 if you go to 711 today. <br /> <br />I can see if it was a year or two from now, but it's not. If it was Dec 2006, then it is worth it to pay that much for this, cuz it is a collectors item. <br /> <br />Also, for a few extra dollars more, you can get the full length CD, or perhaps the DualDisc, which is amazing.
0553801503|4.0|A Feast For Crows is another magnificentnovel written by George R.R. Martin in his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  With that said, there are some elements of the book that displeased me as an avid fan. <br /> <br />First I must mention the missing POV's.  Yes, I already knew that they would be missing but that's besides the point.  The entire book should have been released as one volume.  I don't care if it would have been 1500+ pages, it still should been released as one solitary novel.  Instead, the publishers wanted more money from the public so they released it in two. <br /> <br />The POV's that Martin focuses on are fascinating.  Despite what some others might say, I enjoyed the new POV's concerning Dorne and the Iron Islands.  I thought they added new perspectives and greater depth to the overall series.  Cercei and Jaime's POV's are interesting to say the least and are incredibly well written and I enjoyed them the most out of any other.  I would have hoped that more time would have been spend on Arya but Sansa IMO is not that particularly interesting so I didn't have too much of a problem with her lack of chapters.  The chapters on Brienne were alright but not very significant and the ones involving Sam were kind of drab.  Overall, Martin does a wonderful job weaving his characters together but the missing POV's somewhat hurt the storyline.  It also didn't help that Dany, Jon, and Tyrion are my favorite characters in the series. <br /> <br />One element that angered me was the fact that the book ends with  a few cliffhangers.  That made the ending of the book feel cheap.  In Martin's other three books, each had a logical conclusion that made the reader feel fulfilled but yet still wanting more.  The conclusion to this book makes you say \\"WTF it ends like this!?!?!?!?\\"  Martin would hve been better off ending the book with a logical conclusion instead of a ridiculous cliffhanger that we won't read the conclusion of for another year or more. <br /> <br />As Isaid, overall this is still a wonderful read and a great addition to the series.  Some elements of the POV's as well as the ending forced me to take away a star from its overall score.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I looked forward to this album, having always enjoyed Madonna's early output. However, this collection of songs is all surface, with none of the excitement, or creativity that marked her early work. It is a collection of songs that caused me to feel cheated and annoyed that I had fallen prey to an effective PR campaign. Madonna has recorded a number of trend setting and fun songs over the years; unfortunately none will be found on this particular release.
