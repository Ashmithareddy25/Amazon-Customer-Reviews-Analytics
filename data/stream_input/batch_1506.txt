0062011847|2.0|SNUFF feels like Pratchett is attempting to write a Significant Novel rather than an entertaining story. As with most such efforts, it feels flat and forced (leaden, even), thus succeeding at neither. I'm not sure what happened in the making of this book, but it goes very, very wrong after the first quarter or so and feels little like a typical Discworld novel. Fortunately, I read this from the library rather than spending money it. I'd advise the reader to do the same; go read his earlier Vimes novels if you haven't already.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|no complants at all it is great to pass time plenty of games some are actually kinds hard would not get rid of it at all

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Remember the first time you heard \\"Far Cry\\" from Snakes and Arrows? You probably thought to yourself, \\"I knew they could still bring it.\\" Unfortunately, S&A didn't rock. But Clockwork Angels does.<br /><br />For the reviewers who don't like this sound and are giving the album 1 or 2 stars, I have to ask, \\"What is wrong with you people?\\" We've been waiting for a Rush album to sound like Clockwork Angels for 30 years!<br /><br />Sure, not every song is a classic, but The Anarchist and Headlong Flight are worth the price of this album. Throw in Caravan, BU2B, Carnies, Halo Effect, Seven Cities of Gold, The Wreckers, and the unbelievably gorgeous The Garden, which is arguably the most beautiful song they've ever recorded, and Clockwork Angels should satisfy lifelong Rush fans.<br /><br />As another reviewer put it, this is a combination of 2112 and Test For Echo, and it is very close to perfection.

B003Y5H5AG|1.0|If you have young children, who enjoy basic (silly) stories, then buy this film. However, if you're watching this movie because you loved the smurfs as a child, then don't bother... the movie = \\"yuke\\". The movie had a highly predictable story line, and flat characters. The majority of this film consisted of one line jokes, slap stick comedy, and simple story telling. Also, the movie had no strong magical flavor, or enchantement (as the tv show had had). The director/writers had a lot of material to work with (from the tv show/comic), but instead he/she used only bare basics, such as using smurfs, and that's about it. No REAL imagination or effort was put into this movie. If you grew up loving the smurfs as a child I wouldn't recommend watching this film. However, if you are the type of person who likes the garfield, and the chipmunk movies then you'll love this movie... which is nothing more then a watered down version of a classic cartoon.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was the physical appearance of the smurfs. Their designs had been the one thing the director tried to mirror from the show/comic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First of all, I had decided I wasn't going to read this book because of all the craze. However, I then read the Hunger Games trilogy and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, so I decided to give this book a shot. Oh my lord...The only thing I can think is that the women who are all hot and bothered over this book are possibly women stuck at home with less than interesting sex lives. I'm sorry, that's a generalization, and I don't really mean it, but that's what keeps popping into my head. This book seems like it was written by a 16 year old girl with fantasies about very wealthy men taking care of her for the rest of her life. No really...it's bad. This book is almost 400 pages (I believe 380 to be exact). I'm a speed reader, and I read a lot. It is my favorite hobby, a good way to wind down. I've read 800 page books in less than 3 days. I've been trying to read this book now for almost 4 days and I'm barely a quarter of the way through it. I'm going to finish it since I paid for it, but truly, I can't get through more than 2-3 pages at a time without wanting to throw my kindle. It's comical how poorly written it is. And besides that, the author is clearly english, because she describes everything in english terms. I find that funny since the book is based in WA (oh twilight, how you've ruined the literary world).<br />By the end of this book, I may personally kill Anastasia's inner goddess. I am truly curious what it is everybody see's in this book. Please...enlighten me.
B002XZHDKU|5.0|I like forensic science tv shows. Bones is in a different category because this show has a great ensemble cast and infuses the show with humor. The show also includes good storylines for the ensemble cast members. You don't see this happen very often with tv shows.<br />The \\"Foot in the Foreclosure\\" episode from Season 5 is an excellent example of how the Bones tv show uses humor in it's storylines. This episode is one of my favorite episodes of the show. I watch this episode when I want a good laugh. What also great about this episode is that it showcases \\"Ralph Waite\\" from the \\"Waltons\\". Ralph Waite really surprised me with his ability to do humor. I hope that the tv show will include more of Ralph Waite as \\"Booth's\\" grandfather in the show. He's great.
B00845PV16|1.0|okay, so i wish they had negative star rating because this waste of time rates a -2 on my scale. The first was pretty good, this one, however, is a complete waste of time and money.I managed to make it 45 mins in before finally having enough of the suck.

1401937519|5.0|Incredible, life-changing, awesome experience as you read this book and follow the journey of Anita Moorjani.  I have never been so moved or inspired as when she discusses her Near Death Experience. It will uplift you and take you to a higher place of understanding where you have never been before. For people with cancer, it will offer you solutions and understanding that could truly solve your issues with the disease. Her sincerity and compassion is like a beacon of light that leads you through her journey. Blessings to her for sharing her experience with the world.  Her words will save many lost and confused souls.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am on a 3rd listen. The keyboards are back! Well, sort of. They have added some piano (last song) and some keyboards in places which really add a lot to the sound. This may be the best album since hemispheres. I have them all. I thought the mix on Vapor Trails was bad, too much treble. Snakes was much better but only the first half of the album was great, with a few boring tunes near the end. With the exception of the filler BU2B2, I like all the other songs on Clockwork. Musically, this may be their best album. Alex uses a variety of guitar tones that sounds like the 80s and 70s at times with chorus and reverb and some clean electric tones (think Time Stand Still). Neil continues his angry diatribe against God (the \\"Watchmaker\\") here, and this can all be traced back to his personal tragedies. There were a few songs about this on the last half of Snakes (Faithless). In Clockwork, he lets loose and dedicates a whole album to the theme as he battles trying to explain an evil world and why bad things happen to good people. He even takes a swipe at a verse in Proverbs in the Old Testament in the title track. Once you get past that, this is a great album. Hopefully Neil has finally gotten this out of his system now and can move on to other topics in the next album. Great album!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Three different versions of this George Romero classic for under 10 dollars? (with an original near 50 dollar pricetag?) It's a steal. Each of the three versions has their own merits, and while it might be tedious to watch through all three of them, any one of them is much better than the zombie garbage trotted out in todays cinema. Engrossing musical score, actual quality acting and a brilliant social commentary on the 1970's in a nutshell. It's unfortunate horror today aren't made with the same thoughtfulness as this movie or any of the other Romero zombie movies (Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The dead and the 2005 Land Of The Dead included). Snag this up while its still so cheap

B001KL3GY0|5.0|Franz Ferdinand never fails to impress me. I don't know how they do it, but they manage to keep making great music with monotone-style vocals. There's always an ear-catching beat and instrumentals cranking out in every song. This album is awesome! It builds on their previous records, but still manages to create new things. This album was very good, and now I'm waiting to see what they have up their sleeves for the next album.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|PROMETHEUS is a great triumph for Ridley Scott in many ways. Not only is the film absolutely stunning visually, but it has a very good story to back it up. It takes place years before the ill fated crew of the Nostromo ever make it to Zeta II Reticuli in 1979s ALIEN. You dont have to have seen ALIEN to really enjoy PROMETHEUS, but if you have, you will notice many cues from ALIEN that trascends into PROMETHEUS only making the film that much better for those of us that loved ALIEN. Alot of questions from the first film are answered in this one, but it also manages to raise a whole set of new ones! Over all, I can easily see PROMETHEUS being the #1 sifi film of 2012. The only drawback I can say about PROMETHEUS is having to wait so long for the Blu-Ray 3-D release is a real pain!! I cant wait to see it again.......AT HOME!!!
B0037W68F4|5.0|After I listened to MGMT's first album, I was very excited when they released this album. After first I just listened to the songs I had seen the videos to. But as I listened to the rest of the album, it just grew on me. It's like listening to a symphony with the MGMT touch. As far as I know, there's no other sound like this MGMT album. It's a wonderful experience. That's what MGMT is, an experience.
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|The Tree of Life is an ambitious and at times powerful film liberally dappled with moments of deep introspection on the meaning of fatherhood and family. The visuals are often astonishing, complementing the superb acting by the well selected cast. Director Terrence Malick (The Thin Red Line) juxtaposes the wonder of birth with the agony of death and guides the viewer to ponder the meaning of it all. Brad Pitt (Legends of the Fall, Seven, 12 Monkeys, Inglorious Basterds) puts on an earnest and riveting performance as the stern father whose disciplinary approach to work and family results in consequences not intended. Sean Penn (Taps, Sweet and Lowdown, Mystic River) is perfectly cast as the haunted oldest son that reflects on his anger with his father, his remorse over his eldest brother, and the empathy of his mother. And the beautiful Jessica Chastain (The Debt) has a turn as the quiet, but strong woman who endures her husband's struggles as the bread winner while raising three willful sons.<br /><br />Jack O'Brien (Penn) has reached middle age, the same age at which his father (Pitt) was when his elder brother R.L. (Laramie Eppler) was killed, probably in combat during the Vietnam War (although this is not stated). Jack, apparently childless and unmarried (again unstated), meanders through his memories of his childhood in an attempt to understand how he had arrived at this point of his life. As an architect he has risen beyond the aspirations of his engineer father, yet in some ways has failed to achieve the things his dead brother had accomplished thirty years in the past.<br /><br />His adolescent bullying of R.L. has left him with profound guilt, particularly as it arose as a way of lashing out at his father, who was always above reproach. Only later following a humiliating demotion did his father acknowledge his regret at his harshness during Jack's upbringing, explaining once again that it was only his intent to adequately prepare his sons for the harsh realities of adult life. And in fact Jack eventually benefits from his upbringing, successfully controlling his own career. But at what emotional cost?<br /><br />Malick also teases the audience with the larger issue of relevance. The Earth is impossibly old, and whole eras have lived and perished before the advent of modern civilization. Similarly the universe will exist far into the future, long after the ashes of today's era are only a memory. So why does life matter, particularly in the face of the pointlessness of death?<br /><br />The moral of the story of course is that life is short and that one must bear up under the worst and reconcile with those they love to truly make the best of things. This is pretty weighty stuff. In fact the poignancy of how this message is delivered often leaves the audience adrift in their own thoughts, hurrying to catch up.<br /><br />Emmanuel Lubezki's (Meet Joe Black, Sleepy Hollow, Burn After Reading) beautiful cinematography takes full advantage of the period sets and costumes, while special effects guru Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner, Star Trek, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) marries fully rendered CGI scenes with experimental old school visualizations. Trumbull's efforts are hit and miss. While the CGI is ingenious, the pre-CGI motion photography is no better than that found at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, another film he was the visual effects supervisor for. As in the older film the manual effects leave too much room for interpretation and actually distracts from the look and feel of the otherwise smooth editing (Hank Corwain, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber, Mark Yoshikawa) and storyline.<br /><br />Sean Penn, in spite of his repulsive politics, is insightful when he sticks to his own area of expertise--filmmaking. His remarks included an observation that the film would have been more effective with additional narration, something this reviewer agrees with. But he also acknowledged that those that watch the film with an open mind were likely to find their own \\"emotional or spiritual connection to it.\\"<br /><br />One remarkable detail was the lack of lines for all but the Mr. O'Brien character. Penn had no lines at all. Chastain had a few, although they were important to the storyline.<br /><br />Pacing was an issue at times. The adolescent scenes dragged on in excess long after they had accomplished their mission. In contrast scant footage was given to Penn, making it difficult to connect the younger and older self. There were other problems. The beginning of the film starts with the death of R.L., and the manner in which the scenes are shot left the audience grasping at loose ends in confusion while trying to make sense of it all. Also the end was excessively cryptic and unsatisfying, with visuals taking priority over plot elements or even comprehensibility.<br /><br />The film also misses badly with some demographics. The sweet spot among viewers were those with brothers and those with children. But for sisters, young adults, and older adults with no children, the movie had a limited appeal at best or the potential for an utter lack of understanding at worst. It is because of this and the unconventional visuals that the movie was as likely as not to be made at all. This reviewer suspects that only Brad Pitt's involvement and his agreement to play the Mr. O'Brien character allowed the movie to gain sufficient financial backing to be shot and released under Fox Searchlight as an indy film. This theory is given further credence by the fact that most of the talent that worked on the film has an association with either Malick, Pitt, Penn, or all three.<br /><br />The Tree of Life did garner three Academy Award nominations (Director, Picture, Cinematography), although it was never a seriously in contention for any. It did win a number of secondary awards, mostly for cinematography (well deserved), and for Chastain as supporting actress. The movie was a domestic bust ($13M) given its lush budget ($32M) for special effects, period sets, and costuming. It did pull down $41M internationally, but it is difficult to translate those dollars into profits given the wide range of distribution costs that are possible.<br /><br />In the end, the picture's primary winners were Chastain, Penn, Pitt, and 20th Century Fox. Chastain's performance launched her into instant stardom, and Pitt and Penn both solidified their reputations as serious actors. In Pitt's case one hopes his company (Plan B Entertainment) didn't take too much of a bath on backing the film. Fox Searchlight got an expensive but effective piece of advertising for its Searchlight brand.<br /><br />As for Malick, well, he may never get so close again to an Oscar. The Tree of Life was chock full of talent both in front and behind the camera, an ensemble that will be difficult to duplicate in today's highly competitive filming environment. It would have helped if the film was a financial success or had a wider appeal among audiences. Instead it ended up being an art house film with aspirations for critic's plaudits that just missed being truly great.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Ok, so buying the case at $40 would have been a bit excessive, but as soon as I noticed the drop in price, I immediately bought this case. Before, I had the Verso Prologue Case. No stand, no bungee, and the elastic straps gave the Fire almost no stability. But it was beautiful! I could kinda get it to stand on the front and back by bending it backwards, but some apps the video was upside-down. Moral of the story, all my problems had been addressed with this new case EXCEPT the Prologue had room for my stylus between the spine and that side of the Fire. This case, while very very slim and quite frankly sexy, cannot for the life of it carry a stylus on it. I know what you all are thinking, \\"That's what pockets are for, guy.\\" Yeah, well, I'm in a wheelchair. No pockets. At the least, no accessible pockets. So not putting a clip or pocket or something to hold a stylus in the next iterations of this product is tacit approval of keeping the world inaccessible to wheelchair bound people everywhere and I will NOT stand for it! (See what I did there?) That last line was BS, everything before the word \\"At\\" however, true story. (PS, everyone who has problems standing it, bend the piece back and forth for a few minutes. Loosens it right up and it'll stand every time.)
B007BRJYF2|1.0|Got halfway through the game and came across a few glitchy parts before I got to a glitch so bad that I can't move forward in the game anymore and had to quit.  All the bad parts were during the hidden object parts.  One in the White Rabbit's house asked for a Strawberry but when I clicked the clue (because there is no strawberry) what they wanted you to find was the white ruffled neck ruff!  The other area was in the Cheshire Cat woods.  Again, had to use the clue button because there was NOTHING else in the scene to find.  The clue identified circular areas 1 - where there was nothing inside them but the background and 2 - one circle the center of it was off the viewable part of the scene.  Yes, I did move the scene around but there is only black border around the scene and that is the area that the clue identified the hidden item to be!  Super frustrating and I don't see how to get past a game that you can't win.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|as a 50 something...and growing up with rock 'n' roll...the music means more to us of that time than what music means to most casual listeners now.  Now it's mostly about the videos and fashion but to us older generation, it was about young love, memories and how we interpreted the lyrics and the rhythm (not how they were interpreted for us).  The Beach Boys take us to the beach (and growing up in Ohio, I never saw the beach till I was 21 for the 1st time), to cruisin' in cool cars and dating beautiful girls of our dreams.  As we lose more and more artists of our youth every year, we'd better enjoy each project the living rock 'n' rollers give us when they release a new CD. (wish it was still vinyl though).  Bravo Beach Boys for the GREAT music!
B000WC39SG|4.0|The blu-ray single disc version of A BRIDGE TOO FAR is one of the best examples of why I believe it is a mistake for Amazon to lump all reviews together of a film no matter which format of that film the viewer is referring to.  I realize they have tried to minimize the problem by putting a link at the head of the review in order to distinguish which version the review is from, but sometimes the prospective buyer may have to wade through several pages in order to get the information he or she needs.  And I also understand that separating the reviews will not guarantee that reviewers will include all the useful information that the buyer is looking for - there are always reviews that only deal with the entertainment value of the film and ignore technical aspects of the product.  I often do it myself, but in the case of a film like BRIDGE, which has been around for 35 years, people are much more likely to be interested in the details concerning the different formats rather than a summary of the film.<br /><br />Okay, end rant.  I dislike starting off a review complaining about Amazon's policies, but in this case, it seems more frustrating than usual.  Had I a chance to read all the reviews concerning this edition of the film, I may have opted for something different.  But as there are 240 reviews of this film, I only scrolled through a few of the 24 pages before deciding to buy.  Since I didn't see anything that really bashed the format I went ahead and pulled the trigger and bought.<br /><br />Visually, I think the film holds up well in comparison to other films from this era which have been transferred to blu.  I don't have the DVD version to compare it to, but I have to wonder if a good up-convertor wouldn't minimize the difference between formats to make the difference negligible for most viewers.  There was certainly still grain in the version I watched, though I thought the night scenes stood out well, and I'm pleased with the way the film looked overall.  Havingsaid that, I also have to admit that, to me, film grain is not a big deal.  in fact, under certain circumstances, I can accept a wide-range of imperfections in the film stock.  A BRIDGE TOO FAR, or at least this edition, was more than acceptable to me in all regards.<br /><br />A quick note about the audio - as another reviewer mentioned, several times during breaks in the dialog, the film's theme, or a variation thereof, swelled out of the background to the foreground at a inordinately high level.  I had to jump for the remote several times to turn it down, and then up again when people were talking.  Not so much that it was a deal breaker, but certainly was annoying.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the format is that there are no special features included except for the trailer.  None of the extras listed on the collector's edition DVD, nothing specific to this blu-ray, nothing.  I find it hard to believe that with the expanded room on a blu-ray dis that no one was able to squeeze these extras on to the primary disc.  Perhaps it isn't possible - but buyer beware, all you are going to get here is the movie itself.  For the price, that may be an acceptable trade-off, but I have to wonder why it was done that way in the first place.  Is there such a demand for this film that the makers of the blu-ray thought they could make the buyers double dip and buy another collector's edition in blu later on?  Seems doubtful to me.  For whatever reason, it is what it is, and all you get with this format is the film and a few trailers.<br /><br />As for the film itself - well, they don't make 'em like this anymore.  There's a certain style about this film that places it firmly within the time frame it was made, especially with its all-star cast and singleness of purpose.  Stuffing as many familiar faces into a film as possible, and then highlighting the fact seems ripe for parody now, and most war films nowadays aren't so much interested in bringing the relative facts of the campaign to the screen as they are making the film act as commentary on race relations, the human condition, or, worst of all, drumming up support for the filmmaker's agenda.  While some of the blockbusters from this time really show their age, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, on the other hand, makes the most of the style.  Other than the fact that it can be a little distracting every time I notice another familiar face ('hey, isn't that John Ratzenberger?'), everyone here contributes, and even if Gene Hackman is a little over the top as the film's pathos pivot, and Dirk Bogarde is almost as distasteful here as in THE NIGHT PORTER, and Ryan O'Neal can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, the acting chores are so spread out that none of these flaws have a chance to sink the film.  Standouts are Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, and James Caan of all people.<br /><br />It was also refreshing to me to watch a war film that was dedicated to portraying the events as accurately and even-handed as possible.  There is very little subtext to this film, no shoe-horning in of causes or bending over backwards to make sure the PC boxes are all checked (other than perhaps the universal idea that War is Hell).  As far as authenticity goes, I'm not an expert who is able to pick out inconsistencies , but I did notice that several of the men who actually were in the battle were listed as advisors to the film.  That surely counts for something.<br /><br />The film's biggest failing is probably its script.  This had to have been an enormously difficult story to tell - actually, I think director Attenburough does an excellent job getting the information out in a lucid and relatively simple manner.  The problem - the trade-off, if you will - is that the first 40 minutes of the film is nothing but talking about the operation to follow.  Yet understanding the strategy behind operation Market Garden is critical to understanding the film - otherwise there is the danger of its falling into a hopeless jumble of people moving about for no discernible reason.  The plan is to airlift 30,000 men behind enemy lines where they will secure three separate areas and the bridges contained therein.  British tanks will meanwhile race up the 62 miles between the front line and the farthest bridge, securing the gains, and giving the allies an easy route into Germany, and the German industrial areas.  And the war would be over by Christmas.<br /><br />It can be difficult at times to know which fellow belongs to which group assigned to do what task, but most of the pieces seem to sort themselves out well enough by film's end.  And I think it was actually a rather remarkable ending for the type of film it was - almost art-house in its images.  All together, I think this is a very enjoyable film, and while it may not be as powerful as it was when it was first released, it hasn't lost all its effectiveness.  Combined with a rather rousing score by John Addison,  A BRIDGE TOO FAR is definitely recommended for fans of WWII films and war films in general, though depending on your interest, this may not be the best format to invest in.  After watching the film, I immediately looked for what special features were available, and I have to say that, even for the bargain price I paid for the film, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything there.  Four stars for the film, and despite my complaints, for the format as well - audio and visual were quite good, and if one is aware of the lack of special features they can decide whether this version fits THEIR needs.  I do think Amazon should do a better job advertising the details of the product though.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Ford County was very different from anything John Grissom has written in the past.  It was sometimes funny, but easy reading and entertaining.  I heard Grissom on a TV interview prior to reading this book.  He was mysterious with his answers, which intrigued my interest.  The stories were short and I was a little disappointed with that.  If you only have a short period of time to read, this book is ideal.
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased this trilogy the week ending May 19th, started reading it on May 22nd and finished the third book on June 9th.  I loved it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This App is very useful. It's varied reading plans and many features make it a dynamic way to spend time in the Word. I especially like the \\"read aloud\\" feature which enables me to close my eyes in a favorite chair and enjoy the narration. You can take notes, mark passages and much more. I would recommend it highly.
B005723JSQ|2.0|This book was funny in some parts but over all CHEESY and lame.  I predicted the ending in the first few chapters.  If you want a fluff, you'll like it, it's written well and thoughtful. There just wasn't enough substance for me.
1612130283|1.0|PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!<br /><br />I cringed when I first heard about this trilogy because anything \\"taboo\\" becoming mainstream always goes wrong. But I read this so I could legitimately provide a critique and not just completely trash it without some background. That being said, my initial cringing was not in error.<br /><br />First, Fifty Shades is poorly written. I'm not expecting great literature out of erotica, but when the same words and phrases are used over and over to describe people and scenarios, it gets tedious. Apparently, Ana and Christian love to \\"murmur\\"... that's how they talk most often. People don't do that!<br /><br />Second, the characters are two dimensional stereotypes. Oh look, Ana is a naive virgin graduating from college... no clue about the ways of the world... struggling to decide her future... knows absolutely nothing about sex and has never even gotten herself off... oh she is so innocent. And here comes the big bad wolf, Christian... gorgeous and rich and a complete ass... he knows how the world works and must corrupt the innocent Ana... he has suffered and is broody and doesn't like to cuddle!<br /><br />Third, this is barely masked Twilight fan fiction. Innocent Ana falls for the mysterious Christian. He tells her over and over that he's dangerous, she should stay away from him. But she can't stop thinking of him and he stalks her every move. At least he doesn't sparkle in daylight!<br /><br />Fourth, the sex for the most part is uninteresting and unrealistic. Every single orgasm Ana has is mind blowing, regardless of the stimulation or how long it takes to get there. And, of course, Christian \\"releases\\" at almost the exact same moment every time they have intercourse. The descriptions get repetitive and by halfway through the book you're thinking \\"just get it over with, already\\".<br /><br />Fifth, the lifestyle should not be written about by someone who based her knowledge on stereotypical representations in movies and television crime dramas. Sure every Dom has a \\"room of pain\\" that's all dark red walls and loads of leather and chains. And Doms have major mood swings and hide their true feelings. And the contract... oh my god the contract. So many things about this book made me want to throw it across the room, but the descriptions of the lifestyle were the worst of all. It ticks me off that so much of the vanilla world, because of this book, now thinks that what's portrayed here is what happens.<br /><br />Yes, I know this is a work of fiction and not intended to be taken as truth. But because there are so many women reading these books who think this is how it really is, I think it deserves to be taken to task for going about things all wrong. I feel sorry for anyone who gets into the lifestyle because of these books... at the least, they'll be disappointed and at worst they could end up damaged.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is an easy to read helpful calculator to have around. Instead of searching for one you have one right on your phone. This has helped me by just being right there to use. I love this calculator.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have read this book, mostly from cover to cover.  It is not quite as good as the first one but the more I read, the more I lost myself in the story of Peeta, Gale and Katniss.  I will certainly read the last one.  They say it is a children's book but I think it is the story of good, versus bad and therefore it will appeal to all people who like a good story.<br />I would add, I had a little trouble when ordering the kindle edition due to the names of the books.  I am lucky because Kindle tells me if I have ordered this particular book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible app.  It has a lot of different translations which is helpful. I also  like that it also has daily reading plans too.
B000TEUCFA|3.0|What an absolutely lovely and supple voice ex-pat Stacy Kent has . I keep listening to this recording and waiting for it to morph into something swinging . To sing in French as well (and in such a lovely and effortless manner) . The woman can certainly sing and has a beautiful voice . Instrumentally , i part company with the Brit authors of the various PENGUIN GUIDE TO JAZZ volumes . To me , this is folk/pop . I like popular music . At NO time are my socks , even remotely , threatened with being knocked off . Semi faux jazz for someone ? you decide . Great musicians as well (i'm told) . To each their own .

B00005UOXL|5.0|If you had to pick one CD for your Billy Idol collection this would be on the top of my list followed by Devils Playground. Those 2 Cd's are Idol classics. I would put Rebel Yell up near these 2 as well. His other Cd's are very forgettable.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Although her politics are a turn-off, I've always liked Bonnie Raitt's music, and have all her albums (that I know of).<br />This newest album is every bit as good as anything she's ever done before.  And the musicians are top-notch (also as usual).<br />This lady never seems to get old, but just keeps getting better (if that's possible).<br />I love this CD!

1592402690|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Hearing Geoff Emerick's amazing stories makes you feel like you were there as his unbelievable experiences with the Beatles unfolded. This book is indispensable for anyone interested in the technical aspects of music and music recording. Geoff is simply the best music engineer in the business and he can tell a good tale, as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wish to see character-based abilities.<br />But this is still a great game, one of the best I've seen in a while.
B0086700CM|4.0|this isnt a bad game but isnt the best. it is fan and addicting. if u want a good free app get temple run. not good for first time kindle users though. i disnt give it five stars because it isnt that good. it also has good 3d graphics. one con is it is much better with real money. otherwise it takes a long time to get coins and objectives. tilt and the screen is used which is y i dont recommend it to first time users. overall it is very good game. :)
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I am usually disappointed with puzzle games but this one was great fun. not too easy, though it had hints if you needed them. good flow to the game. some of the games repeated with a harder difficulty.
1594744769|4.0|This book is fantastic, really. The photographs are just so haunting and lovely... They tie into the written words so well and make such a beautiful flow. But my favorite thing about this book is the fact that at the beginning it is unclear whether or not the events in this book could be fact or fiction. Now, obviously the book IS fiction, but the way the story progresses is almost in a true to life fashion; it's seemingly believable to begin with. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone with a taste for the... Peculiar.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I simply don't believe anyone else, before or after, could have done this. Her energy is incredible, she oozes confidence and when she sings she sure sings! I'm so glad to be able to see this again in high quality and it brings back sooo many good memories!!
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Whether you're watching television's \\"Glee\\" or \\"Rock of Ages\\" where you have actors cover hit songs, there will be controversy.  This film will likely be no exception.  Many will like the fresh delivery.  Others will want to just stick with the original.  Based on the popular Broadway show, \\"ROA\\" ups the star power and the production value in this excellent rendition.  The flimsy premise isn't anything new.  A young wannabe singer (Julianne Hough, \\"Footloose\\") from Tulsa heads to Hollywood in 1987.  She meets up with an equally attractive bar-back (Diego Boneta, \\"Mean Girls 2\\") who's also a wannabe front-man in a rock band.  They make nice, make out and fall in love complete with appropriate falling-in-love scenes including the requisite visit to the giant HOLLYWOOD sign.<br /><br />Put all that aside.  What's fun is the secondary performances of a large catalog of 80's \\"big hair\\" bands including Journey, Bon Jovi, Guns `n Roses, Styx, Twisted Sister, Poison and many others.  Not only are these well done, they are performed by some unlikely actors including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand, Malin Akerman, Alec Baldwin and most importantly Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  They are all terrific and yes they can sing.<br /><br />One of my favorite songs and scenes is when Sherri (Hough) quits her job at the famous Bourbon Club and must take a job at an upscale strip club headed by a sympathetic Mary J. Blige.  They harmonize on the great Quarterflash song, \\"Harden My Heart.\\"  The real star here however is Cruise as Jaxx, certainly a take on Axl Rose and others.  If you thought you saw something special when Cruise played profane producer Les Grossman in \\"Tropic Thunder,\\" wait `til you see his perpetually stoned Jaxx.  And make no mistake, he's for real and can deliver a song.  I don't know if the Academy has the ability to remember back to June, but Cruise's supporting performance is worth a nod.  The movie's a blast.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It starts off with a good action packed beginning. Loki (the god of mischief and trickery) is trying to take over the world, again, but this time it's Earth. Naturally we have to defend this big ball of dirt we live on, so we bring in the big guns and show them off, and when that's not enough, we don't show them off anymore, we use them. Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hulk, Thor, and last but not least Hawkeye, all join together with the help of Nick Fury (the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.), to give Earth a fighting chance of defeating Loki and his army of evil aliens who want to take over the world. I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, so I'll quickly end this review without hurting anyone's movie watching experience by saying this: it WILL exceed your expectations and raise the bar for the next superhero action movie you see.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|This movie has one thing going for it.  Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene.  She has been held upside down is some cryogenic capsule for 12 years.  She manages to escape thanks to some mysterious person, and here comes the good part.  She finds her black boots and black leatherette outfit.  That alone is cause for applause.<br /><br />The rest of the film you've seen before.  It turns out that a 12 year old girl (do the math) has been held captive by an underground werewolf colony.  She's rescued by Selena - who has done the math - and a new hunky vampire (Theo James).  The werewolves are headed by scientist Dr. Lane (Stephen Rea) who has turned his son into some super duper giant sized wolf.  Plenty `o guts are expelled over the 88 minute running time.  I guess we'll have to wait for yet another installment to find out what kind of powers young Eve (India Eisley) might possess.<br /><br />Another thing going for it is the spectacular Blu ray transfer.  In 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, you can't ask for much more, assuming your display can handle it.  Blacks are really black.  The detail is excellent.  No complaints.  Likewise, I don't remember such an all encompassing soundtrack.  The DTS-HD MA has a 7.1 surround availabilty and the surround is used liberally.  Everything from quiet creaks to blood-slurpping will hit your speakers in lossless high fidelity.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This is my first review of a film that does not focus solely upon the quality of the video and audio transfer to blue ray.  While I greatly appreciate having the lead character be a strong, independent woman who takes no bs from anyone, I really cannot recommend this film.  One of the worst action films I have ever seen. There are many fight scenes but they all appear incredibly choreographed and highly unrealistic. I know that all fight scenes in all movies are choreographed but in Haywire, you can almost imagine the actors whispering to each other, 'Okay, take a left swing here; I'll duck and throw an elbow there&#34;  The actions are so telegraphed as to be absurd.  The storyline was a bit confusing but worst of all, none of the characters had character. In any good movie, the villain and the hero or heroin are people you are either rooting for or against. They make you feel something. The characters in Haywire make you feel nothing but wanting to look at your watch to see how much more there is left in the film so you can put something else good on. Michael Douglas and other stars are phoning in their performances for a paycheck and they phone pretty well. It's just that there is nothing in this very low budget  B movie that creates any real tension or sympathy for anyone. It appears that most of the interior shots were all roughly in the same local, exteriors as well. I wonder how much this film actually took to make. If someone gave me the film on Blu Ray, I'd give it away.<br />If you have not seen this, don't bother.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Much Thanks
0300176147|4.0|This is a great book for kids and will hopefully get my neice and nephew interested in history, which is a subject I dearly love and enjoy reading about.  My only objection is to the vocabulary.  There are High School graduates out there, however sad it may be, that would need a dictionary to help them with this book.  Much less preteen kids!  I would like to hope that my neice and nephew will do exactly that, use a dictionary (more likely the internet, I suppose) or ask their parents for help - but I just don't know.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have two large lowepro backpacks that will hold everything possibly needed,i have a small tamrac backpack that holds the bare minimum,so i needed a midsize backpack for general carry,vacations,etc.This bag is the perfect size and to me appears that it would work for most people since it will hold two bodies,a flash and several lenses if necessary.All peripheral equipment like chargers,cords,and memory cards store easily in one of the numerous pockets.The bag is surprisingly lightweight so you will not have much bag weight to carry,only equipment.The bag looks well constructed and durable.I always research everything i purchase so i will get no bad surprises,i got a good surprise when i received this bag and inspected it closely. I do not believe you will get a better bag for your money,A great camera backpack at a great price.
B0063IH60K|3.0|its a good game but it takes mental power and patience. but besides the patience its a good way to pass the time.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Just saw the film. I already own the Broadway soundtrack but I have to buy the movie one too. The 80's was the BEST TIME OF MY LIFE. This movie is hilarious~very \\"over the top\\" as the 80's were. I mean we did everything extreme BIG HAIR, Lots of makeup/glitter, Big shoes and the best clothes ever! But the music era was at it's best, nothing rocks as good as 80's music. I almost wanted to get up and dance...the music was so great. I will have to ignore HUFF's voice..very annoying(sings through her nose) but I was truly amazed how well others did. TOM CRUISE blew me away! I mean now we can say he is a TRIPLE THREAT..actor, dancer(Tropic Thunder) and a pretty good voice. He stole the show. Even though I own tons of 80's music..I enjoyed the \\"mash up's\\" of quite a few of my fav's...
B00000AOUD|2.0|I dunno. I can't believe that people give THIS LP five stars and \\"This Was\\" - Tulls much superior first LP 4 and even more dreadful 3 stars. There is no accounting for bad taste. Tulls' first LP and then the following two - Stand Up and Benefit are BOTH better than Thick As a Brick which was overblown and muddled.I can only guess that most of the latter fans came along... well LATER and never heard This Was until they because accustomed to stuff like YES Tales of Topographic Oceans and who knows - Innagadda Da Vida? Mindnumbing. . Anyway Brick is OK... But 5 stars?? NUTS. But THIS WAS instead. And then pick up Stand Up and Benefit. Hell even Aqualung is better than Thick as a Brick.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Not as good as the first movie, but good none-the-less. Actors roles were thin, cues were off, and a couple actors made it un-rewatchable.
B0086700CM|5.0|good awesome fun cool. running sliding jumping best game ever. SO HAPPY ITS ON KINDLE FIRE. GET GET GET GET
B005KR6OBM|3.0|I liked the show. Even though 3rd and 4th season seemed to have been going off track, what happened at the end of the 4th made me want to watch the 5th. lol<br />  Packaging and shape of material when shipped was needing some major re-vamping. Although they said new, I think they were used and repackaged.
B00004XPPE|4.0|This 1964 film was presented shortly after the nail biting Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 in which Americans realized the distinctive possibility that two Superpowers could wipe each other off the face of the globe. In this instance the tale focuses upon the U.S. Strategic Air Command which is trying to impress its higher ups when a series of coincidences lead to false alerts and then finally leads to several bomber aircrafts preparing to nuke Moscow. The President and other advisors are called in as things go from bad to worse. At one point it gets so bad that something horrible has to happen but see the very bottom if you want to read the spoiler.<br /><br />The film was purposefully shot in black and white with close ups that bordered on claustrophobic. The Soviets are never shown but we get details from the translators and things heighten and generals begin collapsing from the stress and being replaced. It's a tense film that may arguably not mean as much today as it did back then. People of the Cold War years will appreciate this film the most, I suspect.<br /><br />It stars a number of big names like Henry Fonda, Walter Matthau and Frank Overton. I noticed some brief roles by Larry Hagman and Dom Deluise as well but I believe this was before they became bigger names. A recent televised play remake came about in 2000 with George Clooney and others starring. They did it in black and white as a homage to the original film.<br /><br />Based on a 1962 novel of a similar title by Eugene Burdick. It was well loved by critics but didn't do as well as the Box Office because it was in competition with a similar and less serious film DR STRANGELOVE.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION THEMES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012.<br /><br />SPOILERS: the American President realizes nobody will believe him if they end up nuking Moscow so he tells their Prime Minister thatif that happens he will have his own men nuke an unaware New York City. The chilling end scene doesn't hold any punches. Moscow is nuked because a bomber crew won't believe they should be called back and that their American President has gone soft so even with the wife screaming on the phone at the head bomber guy he unloads the bombs. At the very end we cut to various<br />still shots of New York City before the bomb drops.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Just to let those that have read the other reviews know, the 'free' version on Google play specifically mentions open feint, while this version does not. That alone makes this version better. That being said, I'm not a fan of a paid app with buyable content, but seeing as this is a Faotd, I'm going to let it slide. If you have any interest in this game, now is the time to download.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I'm enjoying the game and all the things u can do. its like the regular virtual city I can just make it like I want now.

0345803493|1.0|I rarely write reviews but the acclaim this book is receiving compelled me to give my thoughts.<br /><br />The first book was awful for me and I had hoped that by reading this one I would start to like the series. No.<br /><br />My first issue is that it is SOOOOO poorly written. Like many others, I loved Twilight and that wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but this book is worse. I had to start skipping around to the dialogue b/c when the characters weren't speaking I was appalled.<br /><br />Two. The repetition of words drove me crazy, \\"Jeez\\" \\"Laters\\" \\"Holy cow\\" \\"murmur\\". It was just ridiculous. Every other line was Jeez and apparently they only murmur to eachother and everyone else... No one in this book just talks. They all whisper.<br /><br />Three. Having read twilight... The similarities between the books was astounding. Ana IS Bella. Fact. The self loathing, lip biting, blushing, occasional fits of confidence, sarcasm are all the exact traits given to Bella by stefanie meyer... I'd be suing. Christian is similar to Edward but she at least attempted to make him a lil different. They'd be best frieds C and E.<br /><br />Four. Each book happens over like 5 days - 2 weeks. I had read over 300 pages and gotten nowhere. Its basically a book of her thoughts/ daily schedule. I don't need to know every single time they have lunch or every detail of every time they see eachother (which was very often) overkill.<br /><br />Five, its just way to far fetched. Its not a fantasy novel so I expect a degree of realism. Christian is like miraculously cured of his touching phobia (which he's had his whole life) in two weeks.. Seriously? He's paying the best doctors and he's a new man in two weeks because of the overly self consious Ana. Sorry no. The amount of money he's amassed... No.  He's ready to marry her and they are eachothers worlds and its only the second book and again only two weeks. What? He's royally F'd up and damaged but he's ready for marriage with this girl that defies everything he normally goes for. Which would be okay (love at first sight and all) but he has the kind of relationships he has b/c they essentially keep him sane. Its hard for me to believe that he's willing to turn all that around in 2 weeks.<br /><br />All in all. I think its poor erotica , poor fiction, and a rip off of twilight. I'd save my money if I were you.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie was yet another wonderful Marvel adaptation for the big screen.  It has a brave superhero, a super evil villain, a little romance, and a lot of action.<br /><br />The story starts on a very puny Steve Rogers (Chris Evans).  He so desperately wants to join the army and fight the Nazis, but he has multiple physical problems (including being short, weak, and having asthma).  A German doctor/scientist (the incredibly talented Stanley Tucci) sees the goodness within Steve and enlists him to join an experimental project.  Although Steve struggles with the physical training, he clearly has the most heart and is chosen to undergo the first procedure.<br /><br />As expected, the experiment goes off without fail (enter in Tony Stark's dad to provide the technology!) and Steve is transformed into a buff, unstoppable hero.  Unfortunately, the good doctor is killed and Steve is relegated to the menial job of selling war bonds.  So degrading!  He dutifully does his part until on one tour of Europe, he finds out his best friend and hundreds of other Allies are captured as POWs.  He must come to their rescue!  He must also battle a very bad guy, Red Skull (played by the masterfully evil Hugo Weaving), who seeks to control all of Europe with his futuristic technology.<br /><br />Chris Evans is amazing as Steve Rogers.  He played The Human Torch in Fantastic Four and it was not that great.  But he steps into the role of Captain America as if he was born to play it.  Captain America is the ultimate hero, brave and good-hearted.  This is such a fun movie and I loved it!
B006RED4GA|2.0|Based on the movie's \\"popularity\\" I decided to give it a shot. I honestly wish that I hadn't. The acting was mediocre given the movie's low budget but still somewhat convincing.The first half or so is filled with such promise. The ending however, is filled with nothing but disappointment. Pass on this one unless you are really bored.
B007SGM084|1.0|Pure Filth.  Read the first nine chapters of book one and can't go on.  I'm very disappointed.  I would like to have my money back.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot say enough how awful this book is in so many ways! It is repetitive, adolescent, boring, and a waste of paper, ink, e-ink, time, money etc. etc. DS, GadgetChick, and many others have said it in a much better way than I probably ever could, but the lunacy behind this book being a best seller is incredulous! The author writes like a child, simplistic and with poor grammar; it is as if there was never an editor within 10 feet of the book to have such ridiculousness get printed. It is not erotic, it sounds like an 8 year old describing sexual organs, i.e. \\"down there\\", seriously? How this could ever be described as \\"mommy porn\\" is beyond me, if that's what's getting moms off, I feel sorry for you all! It is uninteresting, nonsense and basically a full-fledged fairy-tale written for adults, but using childish words. The author did not even have the decency to learn what she was talking about before writing, or furthermore, publishing her books. Her knowledge of Americans, American geography, colloquialisms for the areas in which the book takes place, is severely lacking and her addition of Britishisms for no other reason than she knows no better being British, is annoying at best. More annoying is her constant repetition of words, phrases, and even sexual acts, as if she just copied and pasted throughout the book. Some imagination would have served her well. Clearly, she is not a good writer, while many obviously are entertained by her books, she could have cut the number of pages and books to 1/3 by removing the God-awful repetition of Ana always thinking something before she says it. Do we really need to read Ana's thoughts before we read her say them to another person?  The book is asinine at best! Do not waste your time or money on this glorified Twilight fan fic when you can get it free on the Internet, if you must read it at all!
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I really cannot understand some of the negativity I've heard about season 5. In my opinion, it is still the best thing on television, without question. In fact, there are more Emmy-worthy performances this season than ever. Elizabeth Moss and Christina Hendricks really get a chance to show their stuff this season, and Jon Hamm, once again, would be robbed if he was cheated the Best Actor Emmy again this year. As always, everything was top notch: performances, costuming, sets, WRITING, direction. Don't believe the negative reviews written here. If you are a \\"Mad Men\\" fan, this is another can't-miss season!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Truly a game to get the old mind thinking again. I didn't play it at first now I have make myself stop or I would be at it all night. well worth the price would pay more for it great game.
B0054YH8VQ|4.0|Billy Joel (as a Song Writer, Keyboard player, and Singer) stands as one of the Greatest, Pop/Rock Entertainers of the 1970s/80s/90s(give or take a few xtra yrs at either end).  As an inveterate music lover and professional ex-singer, i put him right up there w/the likes of Elton John, Barry Manilow, Paul Simon, Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett, Celine Dion etc., who truly, DID IT ALL & MOVED people with his words, melodies, voice and Band!<br /><br />I also feel like many of the greats, his music and career can be broken down into the usual 3 parts; early career, mid-career, and extended/late career.  That said, this Recording and grouping of beautifully crafted and moving Songs, rates as one of the two TOP recordings of his mid-career yrs (1975 thru 1985).  Put simply, how many other of his songs were as extroadinarily moving, catchy, and memorable, as Rosalinda's Eyes, or Zannzibar, not to mention at least two or three other hits on this 'Album/CD'.<br /><br />While Mr. Joel has written exceptional hits from his first recordings onward, at least half of this Album rates up there with his Finest work, including the surprisingly outstanding 'late career' period Hit Songs that in many cases, became even more rousing, energetic and impressive, than many of his earliest hits.  If you have to have one or two of his best mid-career Highlight Recordings, this is certainly one of them.  If you're NEW to BJ's music, this one should truly satisfy your desire to hear, lovely, signficant, rousing, hip swiveling, very singable, even Jazzy, Rock and Pop Hits from the 'Classic' 1970s to mid 1980s era in America.<br /><br />Singer2 (Lee Stern)
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a wondreful game and it has amazing graphics.the only thing I don't like about it is that I have all the people and the sayings (for example Scarlet Fox when she runs into fire it pops up saying &quot;crispy explorer&quot; or &quot; smells like toast&quot;) are kind of offensive. but other than that it is a great app. I advise you to get it and play it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Its pretty fun but don't get it if u have a Galaxy Nexus thing it crashes badly on that thing.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great game to play to pass time.  it's very addicting. works well on kindle fire; but game does freeze. up sometimes. which is annoying but overall it's a great game.
B004UID2LC|2.0|launches and runs in the background, taking battery, data, and ram up, somewhat of a deal breaker for me. Once I saw it was doing that I never really tried it and just got rid of it, so my review is based on that alone and not the actual functionality or use of the app.
B005LCECU6|1.0|You can obtain this show for free.  There is no official release of this show.  This is a pirated version of the bootleg that you can find and download for free.  Don't pay for this.  The money is not going to the band.  Rush strongly supports the ROIO's and this flies in the face of their stance.  Don't buy this if you value the bands you strongly support.  Say no to piracy!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Always self launching and running in the background, using up data, ram and battery without my desire or choice, this pretty much made me decide to uninstall. Unfortunate, because I like the game and this particular app a lot.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|its so fun and there are new worlds every month!if u are an angry bird fan toltally get it u will love it
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I was a zoo keeper back about thirty years ago. I worked with chimps, two gorillas, and an adult orangutan. This film has perfectly captured their behavior, emotions, and how they react to events. I was pleasantly shocked,by the level of understanding by the director,and his research people. This is a fine film.  And the viewer will probably end up rooting for Caesar, and his friends, just as I did .
0517543052|5.0|In the 1950's, a stiff academic named Richard Alpert, wasting his life away at Harvard University by running rats around a maze, discovered a magical potion that lifted a strip off the great veil.<br /><br />So instead of fighting the war, Dr Alperts generation tuned into cosmic consciousness, free love and hot pants. Alpert wanted the source to this Brahma communication, so he went to India to find Brahma.<br /><br />Richard Albert, the Harvard psychologist mentioned above, went to India to find clues to what was giving him, and an entire generation, the spiritual realisation. Alpert was introduced Neem Karoli Baba, a guru who was rumoured to be an ascended master. Alpert gave Karoli Baba a heroic dose of LSD, enough to drop a rhino, but the holy man just smiled.<br /><br />Dr Albert when back to America, perplexed by what he has witnessed and he wanted to dose the old man a second time, to see if he could get him the second time around. So Dr Alpert filled his suitcase with pure LSD and went back to India to give the old man an even bigger dose.<br /><br />On their second meeting, Richard Alpert gave the holy man all of his tablets, pure LSD, but the holy man swallowed them all in one gulp and smiled at the ignorant academic Alpert. Neem Korali Baba told Alpert that these potions were known thousands of years ago and that the strongest drugs would have no effect on one who is already accessing God. Alpert concluded that Neem Korali Baba was high all of the time; he was in direct communion with Brahma. Alpert was shaken and he left the academic life and changed his name to Ram Dass, which means servant to God.<br /><br />So this is the clue. LSD may expand the monkey mind to a balloon and even win a monkey the Nobel prized, but this isn't accessing God. Read Be Here Now to be in communion with God!!!The awakening is taking place on this particulate day, now, as you read this; I realise you may not feel this; this floating above the world. D. T Suzuki, the Japanese Zen master, was once asked what it was like to have satori; satori being the Japanese word for enlightenment., he said: \\"Well, it's like ordinary, everyday experience, except about two inches off the ground.\\"<br /><br />Masters like D. T. Suzuki, and an Indian master I am reading at the moment called Nisargadatta Maharaj, possess an aspect that we scientific minded Westerners seem to have lost. Fortunately, I really do believe that you yourself can start your own floating above the world; right Now. And you don't even need a balloon metaphor to get the point across. You see, if like me, you are not enlightened and so you can't easily turn into a balloon; then you can build a boat to navigate the meat<br />cleaver of life. You can then metaphorically float along the torrents of this world and navigate your own way to the unspeakable; the transcendental Other that all these enlightened characters have been talking about all these years. There is no need for you and I to become enlightened, the rumour of salvation is good enough. The Buddha is reported to have spoken of the importance of the rumour of enlightenment being all that was needed. The rumour that others have done it is enough to transform the minds of the many. The good news of enlightenment, or, as I will call it below, the Gospel of a self transcendence upwards, is comparable to a spark in a shipload of cotton; slowly but relentlessly the whole of the cotton will turn to ashes. Similarly the good news of enlightenment will, sooner or later, bring about a worldwide transformation in consciousness. All that is needed is a tiny spark. But that was over 2000 years ago. Why are we still a wretched species? What is the force that still sticks the noses of the many to the hard concrete of this world of condos, finance and Justin Bieber?<br /><br />Nisargadatta Maharaj says that the world of appearance is a veil of tears, wants, dislikes and fears and you and I are slaves to the eons; trapped in appearance and illusion, as empty shells washed up on the shores desire. Between the banks of pain and happiness the river of life flows on; unmolested and so the trick is not to capsize on the banks. The real secret is to navigate your boat through the howling waves of people and their opinions; and just float along the river of life, or, to use the old clich&eacute;, `go with the flow'. You must therefore trust in your frail craft to navigate soundly between the banks, or to use a modern rendering, The Matrix. The river of life, with its banks of pain and happiness, flows outside the Matrix, you see, and so below I will describe the Matrix and why being stick in a pleasurable rendering of synthetic-Nirvana is not a good idea.<br /><br />You see, it is only when your vehicle capsizes on one of the banks that life becomes a problem. Flow with life, Nisargadatta Maharaj says, and accept I AM THAT, rather than what the other guy's YOU ARE THIS and what the other guy thinks you are. The other guy feeds off your fears and your desires, so don't (overly) desire and don't fear; observe your surroundings; the guy is not in the room with you now; you are. Your body is always present, your mind is not. Your mind is somewhere else. Take back your mind!<br /><br />This is why I am writing this, to help you take your mind back. It isn't hard. You yourself can start your own floating, right now; if you are not fond of heights, then you can stay on land and rather than a balloon, you can float along the torrents of the world.<br /><br />So what are these guys saying? In every human being there slumber faculties to which he or she can attain the higher yoga awareness; the realisation that God resides not in the clouds; but behind your eyelids; this is the doctrine of Tat Tvam Asi, or, I AM THAT. In plain English, this means that the girl selling crack down the road has forgotten that she is God Almighty, looking out onto the world. This sounds good to me and, dare I say it, it should sound good to you too. Why, didn't you know that the God behind your eyelids makes you yourself God Almighty? Yes, you, and all you need to do is switch those faculties on, and off you go!<br /><br />Erwin Schrodinger, the father of quantum physics, remembered; no, he knew this, and this is why he would finish his lectures by declaring, \\"Hence, I am God Almighty\\" to the local Church congregation, and he ended up winning the Nobel prize (though not for thinking that he was God, I am happy to say). If this is the case, then why can't you and I feel this God inside? Well I suppose we can't all be Nobel's because we have bills to pay and diapers to change, and so we can't all feel the divinity because we probably aren't as switched on as Professor Schrodinger was, up in his ivory throne. So I AM THAT is not a confession of lunacy because it is the perennial wisdom. Jesus said \\"behold, the Kingdom of God is within you\\" (Luke, 17-21). This doctrine of Tat-Tvam-Asi; it's a good'en, then, because there is little room for pessimism with Tat-Tvam-Asi, since the Kingdom of God is within you, and me and the girl selling crack down the street; so we can all float above the world.<br /><br />Tat-Tvam-Asi and purpose go together like bread and butter. Tat-Tvam-Asi is less easy to knock over too, because it puts you back in the cockpit, that is, YOU are in charge of your life vehicle; the bank manager may have you by the balls, but he has no idea who you really are. This is by far the more sophisticated of the contenders to your purse and your sanity; Tat-Tvam-Asi is especially good at breaking the dogmatism of priests and the superstition of science; the shackles of man-in-the-sky monotheism and the illusion of the rat race; because, in reality, Eastern wisdom guided Erwin Schrodinger and Albert Einstein out of dead materialism and all right thinking people go for this clever idea (ignore the flag waving from the nihilists) and so we have the licence right there to be babbling optimists, seeking our maker from within. No wonder Erwin Schrodinger would finish his lectures by declaring that he was God Almighty\\" to that bemused Christian audience, and he was a Nobel laureate! This is the doctrine of Tat-Tvam-Asi, or 'I am that', lunacy, maybe, but in the East, we are all God almighty. If you cannot accept your spark of divinity, then tell me; is this not a better view of seeing yourself? What other view is there, now that the God of the sky, who hung the stars like lamps in heaven, is dead?<br /><br />Don't worry, this book won't be a self centred diatribe about my optimism and how I got there. Like I said above, I do not claim that I have cracked it, I have only heard the good news of enlightenment. Anyway, reading about my enlightenment would be tedious to the reader and to my sanity. I see enough of myself in the mirror, writing about myself is not my idea of a good time, you see, it really isn't! Rather, I will write on some philosophical tit bits that can lead the reader to an awakening, not in a self help kind of way, but in an entertaining way. So what are the faculties and how do we switch them on?<br /><br />They say that the feeling of enlightenment starts as a blip, at first, until a torrent awakens the slumbering mind. Now your slumbering mind has awakened to the possibility of enlightenment, you are now a more bearable person to your friends and to your world. This awakening, the masters say, it's like a flickering flame, insights come and go, they never stick at first, only when the sparks catch fire, The Bright begins. You can start feeling better about living on this wretched planet. The knowledge that others have reached satori is enough. What I mean is, even if you yourself are not enlightened, the knowledge that satori, or higher consciousness, is real, is enough to cancel out the figure of nihilism that has been knocking at your door. It is that simple.These Zen people never complicate the experience and I suppose that the simplicity of Zen is what puts many cerebral thinkers off. Intellectual Westerners prefer tensor equations and predicting the future, rather than opening the soul. There is nothing wrong with predicting the future, if this were possible. It is more feasible to open the soul; now.<br /><br />This is what I will write about; the opening of the soul. I do not mean to use the word soul in the popular sense, instead, I will borrow the Sanskrit, `tat tvam asi', which means something along the lines of, `I AM THAT''. Yes I realise that I spoke of Zen and now I'm jumping across the pond to India, but there is a reason for this. The philosophy of optimism floats above the vault of the Earth.<br />I have also coined a very loose translation, `Brahma O Mamma Matrix', this should supply a modern twist to the ravings I am about to unleash. You will notice that I am not including footnotes because the footnotes ended up being a book in size and so I deleted them! All ideas in here are easily `Googled', if you wish to check my references and you can highlight the quotes in the texts and paste them onto a search engine; this way you will easily find the source online. Unless, that is, you are reading this far into the future, and the net has shrunk to a few post apocalyptic websites. Who knows! I would just like to assure the reader that I have researched my opinions and, of course, the mistakes are mine, and apologies if I sometimes come across as somewhat raving and insulting to a certain ontology. Can you guess which one? I will also use humour and many jokes to get my point across and I hope that I do not offend the reader along the way to the light, or, as a master once called it, `The Bright'.<br /><br />Before we proceed however, I will like to make one thing clear. I will avoid the type of academic back-woodsman ship that demands only cautionary and balanced statements, every statement backed by a footnote. Instead, I will give a free-wheeling vent to his opinions and judgements, and I hope you forgive me for this. I have chosen this style because others have shown me this style, and, in his style, I suppose that the baton has been passed on to me. This is for my sanity, and hopefully, yours too and so I make no apologies for many passages being in the style of a polemic, because the polemic is a form of therapy, my therapy, and the higher therapy is something we should all aspire to. This sort of therapy, I hope, will benefit the reader and reach the parts Simon Cowell and Oprah cannot reach.<br /><br />For those readers in the post apocalyptic future, I should explain the terrible twins, Simon Cowell and Oprah. In Great Britain, around the beginning of the 21st Century, Simon Cowell and Oprah were famous the Gods, dispensing their Ecstasy to the masses. The masses would hold their satellite dishes aloft like begging bowls, to be filled by Oprah and Simon Cowell. This was a strange synchronicity woth vedic India. Whereas the ancient civilisations received their telescopic eons of meaning through the triple straw of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; my generation subsided on a dose of Justin Bieber, Oprahism and The X Factor, this, I say, was diva worship for dummies and against this sort of idiocy the gods themselves struggled in vain. The smarter once would shout that `we were not put on this Earth to consume'. `Consuming the pap perturbing out of Oprah's elongated udders is not what we were put on this earth to do'! I hope things are different in your time?<br /><br />Anyway, back to the present. This is why I picked up this old Indo-European idea of `Tat Tvam Asi, not just because it sounds good, but, as I mentioned above, most mystics came to this idea independently of each other, throughout history, and chemistry now allows a verification of this ancient Vedics philosophy. Not only does Tat-Tvam-Asi come with less baggage, it is full of meaning, God and science have little meaning. The word God shuts down the mind, meaning cannot do this; meaning opens the mind, to the spiritual.<br /><br />These ideas will make you feel better about being here; they really will. Special relativity won't do this to you and neither will Barack Obama. This is the higher happiness, not in a Prozac way, but in a concrete way. People mix up happiness with euphoria, but euphoria is canned happiness; not concrete happiness. Concrete happiness is the real happiness because it lays foundations that stick like cement. You never see euphoric people happy all of the time, but this is the version of happiness pumped out of the entertainment industry. Concrete happiness is the thing the Dalai Lama has. His Holiness always has a big grin on his face.g our maker from within.

B006LSZECO|5.0|In the interest of writing a spoiler free review, I will say only that the book is twisted and brilliant.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Reinventing popular culture heroes is always a tricky business-you run the risk of ruining everything that made the original special. Stephen Moffat who currently writes/produces \\"Doctor Who\\" for the BBC  does a marvelous job of taking the essence of Arthur Conan Doyle's crime solving maverick and reimsgines him as a brilliant, high level functioning sociopath (as Holmes described himself in the very first episode of the fist season). Moffat has updated these stories remarkably well and made them less than predictable even if you've read the original stories.<br /><br />The show wouldnt be half as impressive without the brilliant casting of Benedict Cumberbatch, Matin Freeman, Lara Pulver, and Andrew Scott<br /><br />The stories tackled during the second season of the series includes \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" (retitled \\"The Hound of Baskerville\\" here) and \\"The Reichenbach Falls\\". All three are presented in their original feature length presentations on the BBC.<br /><br />All three stories are reinvented with modern trappings taking the basic plot and stories from Doyle's stories but liberally introducing new elements to update them for the 21st century. That means that some of them are a bit surprising in terms of the twists and turns although you might know the outcome at the end, it will help to revitalize the stories and make them entertaining yet again. The weakest of the three presented here is \\"The Hound of Baskerville\\" which does, indeed, receive many updated elements that make it still fun and entertaining but, as it is the most adapted of the Doyle stories, it is also the best known. That said, the script by Mark Gatiss is marvelously inventive with some truly stunning set pieces. Gatiss who plays Mycroft Holmes does double duty in many episodes and as an actor he is truly outstanding as well and might easily be overlooked given the other performers in the show. His work isn't quite as showy but it's every bit the equal of his co-stars.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is quite nice with rich colors, often stunning detail althought the contrast Is a bit on the weak side but overall this looks pretty impressive.<br /><br />Audio is crystal clear although you have to pump up the volume a bit if you choose to listen it in stereo. We also get English subtitles.<br /><br />We get commentary tracks for \\"Belgravia\\" and \\"Baskervilles\\" from the writers/producers Moffat, co-creator Mark Gatiss, cast members on each one Cumberbatch and Purvis joining them on the former and Purvis along with guest star Russell Tovey.<br /><br />We also get a 20 minute featurettes \\"Sherlock Uncovered\\" about the production of the second season.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock\\" improves on an already terrific first season as Moffat and Gatiss radically recreate Holmes for the 21st century.<br /><br />Recommended.s co-stars.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is quite nice with rich colors, often stunning detail althought the contrast Is a bit on the weak side but overall this looks pretty impressive.<br /><br />Audio is crystal clear although you have to pump up the volume a bit if you choose to listen it in stereo.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app! so easy to use! I love the feature where it stores a running tab! would recommend to anyone!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I jumped on the bandwagon with this one and, while I can't say I was disappointed in the story overall, I did feel by the end of it that I was just finishing it to finish it. I'd rather stopped caring about most of the main characters by that point and the excellence of writing had significantly diminished since the descriptive and gripping passages of the first book.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|Not as good as MI II or III, but still enjoyable. Haven't tried the digital copy yet, but appreciate that they bundled Blu-Ray, DVD and digital in a single package.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly, poorly, poorly written excuse for a book. My friends were all a-twitter about this book so I made the mistake of purchasing the trilogy. I made it as far as the intro to the mother and gave up. The writing is sophomoric and the author needs to get out the thesaurus. If you like the words delicious and clenching you will be thrilled because they are used repeatedly.  If you like a male character who has a 'wicked gleam in his eye' and constantly runs his fingers through his thick hair you have something to look forward to on every other page.  If you like a female character whose hair is always a mess and whose lip-biting is a major character trait, you will be delirious.  The characters never become more than two-dimensional cutouts.  If you are reading it for the porn side, you are better off with a 20 second self-induced orgasm and getting back to your life.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Great flashlight, fits on my keychain and I find I use it almost daily !! A lot of light in a small package !
B0086700CM|3.0|When I first got the game, I was hooked. I loved it so much. But now that I have found that the game lags terribly, I no longer wish to play it. This is an awesome game but only if it didn't lag!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Don't expect great physics, this is no golf simulator, but this is a fun little game with hours of gameplay and many levels! 3 levels of difficulty with several courses to play under each. I've been hooked since I installed it!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This CD is a great release from Joe B.  The title song is one of those than you feel like you want to play over and over - nice, slow, and bluezy.  I think every one of the songs are a keeper!
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I had this game on 1 of my phones and I played it for hours so I was so excited when I found out I could get it for my fire.  Its a lot of fun and I still find myself playing for hours its a must have if you like puzzle and RPG games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it a lot I recamend it is awesome it is fun you should totally get it do not want to stop

B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. Highly recommended.  Easy to use and quality graphics. For those that enjoy solitaire this app is perfect!<br />Game can be as easy or challenging as you like.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|The movie was good overall. It dragged in the middle, but the ending was good. It was interesting that the girl didn't see through the father's eye in the beginning of the movie.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Super simple and effective device that provides great macro functionality with any lens. I am new to photography and don't have the budget to spend on loads of lenses at the moment and this provides a more than acceptable way of capturing the details of life. I'm using with a NEX-7 and a Pentax 28mm/f2.8 lens (with Fotodiox adapter) with a 52mm ring. Since it is legacy glass, it is only manual focus so I can't speak for using this with an autofocus lens, but the macro experience with manual focus is downright delightful. Build quality is top notch, covers for both sides of the glass, and a plastic case with foam.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Okay,I like a good unconventional movie over big blockbusters any day, but this movie bored me to tears. I hated the ending and the music was awful. The previews misled me to think the movie was something totally different. Not happy at all.
0345803485|4.0|This book lives up to the hype it has created. Was tough to put down.A very good read. Take time to get this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am someone who only reads when I am really intrigued by  the subject matter. I saw the movie because the idea/story line of Panem and the Hunger Games was very interesting to me and found myself wanting more... so I picked up the book and was pleasantly delighted. Let me tell you, this was a wonderfully entertaining book! I found myself falling in love with the characters and empathizing with their plight. As an adult, I enjoyed the easy read and reminiscent 'me against the world' feeling from my young adult years.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a break from bills, stress, and the pressures of life.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is the best FAOTD I have gotten.  It reminds me of the logic puzzles in the puzzle magazines when I was younger. This game works perfectly on my Asus Slider. It is challenging and really gives my brain a workout, yet it is not so difficult that it's not fun to do. My husband loves it too. I hope they add new puzzles, maybe as an in app purchase? in the future.
B007SGM084|3.0|Dont get me wrong i enjoyed the books just like any other books i read. It wasnt Great but it wasnt bad either. I wouldnt put it under the best book of all time, i feel like the last book was rushed and their were parts that seemed just thrown in their, so that every other page wasnt about sex. The first book was my faviorite but i have to say the last two didnt stand up to the first on at all. I would expect like any other series that the first ones ok and then it builds from their. But for me these didnt do it.
B007KX6U7W|5.0|IF YOU LOVE VAMPIRE DIARIES, but do not have the time to watch the shows on television this is the BEST alternative. We bought season 1 and 2 and have been watching 3 on here, and we think this was such a great idea!
0525478817|5.0|I went into this book not knowing anything about it. My friends refused to tell me anything except that it is the best book they have ever read. I trusted them but was still skeptical, and I am so glad I did. This book was amazing and deffinatly one of my altime favorites. One minute you will be laughing and the next you will be crying. But I urge you to read it with either no, or minimal knowledge of it and trust that it will be good. It's the best way to read it.
0425210480|3.0|THE LOWDOWN: After the awesomeness of \\"Lost City\\" I was a bit let down by this book. It has the usual Cussler excitement, and lots of fun scenes, but the story is kinda lame, and slips back into \\"Fire Ice\\" territory.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A pod of killer whales inexplicably goes berserk during Kurt Austin's sailboat race, and soon after, Paul & Gamay are nearly pulled into a whirlpool at sea. What is going on? Well, both incidents are results of an unlikely pairing of villains' experiments in creating the titular disaster: an electromagnetically induced shifting of the Earth's crust across its mantle (aka Polar Shift.)<br /><br />THE PROS: While much of this book does not make much sense, there are some highly imaginative action sequences taking place. The aforementioned orca attack, Paul & Gamay's dramatic rescue from the maelstrom, Kurt & Joe searching for clues on a rapidly sinking ship, and a scene where Kurt is chased across a civil war battlefield by a motorcycle gang while driving a Stanley Steam car (a Pitt-worthy chase sequence). There is also a mastodon stampede (yes, mastodon) and a ship vs. airplane electromagnetic antennae duel. Paul & Gamay's inclusion in the story added to, rather than distracted me, from it.<br /><br />THE CONS: The story is ridiculous. First of all, the \\"polar shift\\" plot has been used before in Atlantis Found. Secondly, I have a hard time swallowing the premise that some electromagnetic frequencies in the right place could cause Armageddon. The villains are a bit unbelievable too (anarchist bikers who are inexplicably wealthy and have vast scientific knowledge, teamed up with a stuffy elitist businessman.) Last but not least the \\"lost civilization\\" Paul and Gamay come across in Siberia is complete fantasy, and feels like something out of a cartoon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read fairly frequently and hands down, best book I ever read!  Can't wait to see what else E.L. James bring to us!
B002ZG997M|5.0|This movie is captivating, intense, and powerfully written. Amazing performances from all three of the lead actors only scratch the surface of this outstanding script. Throughout the movie I was left with the thought: \\"Wow this is the popcorn flick I was waiting for\\", then the ending hit me like a freight train and thie \\"popcorn flick\\" turned into one of the most memorable and beloved movies in my collection.<br /><br />GREATLY recommended, GREATLY underrated, go buy it now.
B001ECDVKE|1.0|received this movie brand new it played the first ten minutes then sound totally disappeared movie picture still played but no sound what so ever tried in various machines still nothing faulty dvd
B00474IVGA|5.0|This soundtrack is great my favorite track that made me cry when watching the movie Love Don't Let me Down, sure it may not be what you expect but it's still worth listening to it if u like music especially country music that brings you out of those dark places that broken hearts can take you : /
B000KIE11Q|4.0|It's as described, a perfect sport watch. I bought it for my brother as a gift and he liked it.
B000076CY6|3.0|I love all the new lord of the rings sets,but im not to impressed with this one.I think lego did a fair set. Yea theres alot of little pieces but one of the reasons why they charge 39.99 is beacuse of that rare light up brick. This isnt the first time lego has taken advantage of us. Still i guess its fair if you pay 39.99. Another reason why is because its a exclusive set so lego charges more with that too. if you pay over $40 you got a bad deal. amazon is currently charging $50+ so i wouldnt buy it off here until they lower it to the regular price $39.99 . This is a nice set i mean you dont have to use it for the orcs. It would go nice with The battle of helms deep as a smith shop. Please rate comment and ask a question on this set. And please check out my other lord of the rings reviews---This has been a Deal Hunter review----
B005OOSPZO|5.0|My review's purpose is to confirm the outstanding quality of this blu-ray transfer.<br />Unlike many movies, it is highly recommended you upgrade to this version.<br />The picture is truly outstanding.  I don't think it looked this good when I originally<br />saw it in the theater.<br /><br />It also contains the Japanese extended version.  The book is nice, but I'm not sure<br />I wouldn't just buy the regular BD.
0061478784|4.0|A bit different than the movie, which I loved, but excellent book. What a talented writer - I am now interested in reading more of her books.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|This is a the tale of an introverted senior in high school named Andrew. His mother is bed ridden and dying and his abusive stepfather is on disability and grieving that his wife will die soon and that he is no longer useful to society. To make it worse a lot of people in high school bully Andrew or just plain out verbally abuse him. Even his cousin doesn't want to be around him that much and tolerates his presence.<br /><br />That all changes when they stumble upon some alien technology which bonds the two cousins (as well as another friend of the tolerant cousin) and gives the three of them colossal telekinetic powers. Andrew's rage at being mistreated boils up and comes out gradually with abuse until he's literally out of control.<br /><br />On a basic level it's a fun tale about the loser kid getting revenge on those who wronged him horribly but on a deeper level it's about how we sometimes create the monsters around us. It also reminds me of some relatively recent moments in our history in which certain people who were mistreated turn violently on those who persecuted them.<br /><br />Almost all of the movie scenes are told through Andrew's beloved camera or other video recording devices. It is technically known as found footage.<br /><br />The film budget was only $15M but it made over $126M at the Box Office. A sequel is being planned.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SCI FI FOCUSES/ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED this series...book one is the my favorite in the trilogy. It's more than SEX, it's a great story that keeps you engaged! The character relationships are well described and intense. I was ADDICTED and CANNOT wait for another E.L. James series :)

B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is an enjoyable game. I find myself playing this game over the others. Simple controls and easy to learn
B003O86FMW|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is great reading and the second book, Catching Fire, is a must to read after reading The Hunger Games.  I am now on the third book, Mockingjay, and I am wondering what will happen in the end.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I think is well done, entertains and has good scenes. I'm not sure if I will watch it again soon, but I really think is worth watching. Good acting too. I don't regret renting it at all. It actually ended very soon, which means I was into the movie and the time went by pretty fast.
020161622X|5.0|This book covers so much ground, but it is a charm to read. Chapter are well written, short and sweet just enough deep to understand fully each subject and know what to do from that point to improve yourself.<br /><br />It is a reference book that will help you become someone efficient and more methodic. It contains multiples good advices, good practices, interesting experiences that the authors have been through and even ways to improve yourself and your team. I highly recommend it, the perfect book to start your Software Engineer/Developer library or even for someone more experienced who wants to polish his skills.
B000J1U0ZK|1.0|I can not finish the movie because Amazon's video streaming quality is so poor. I have never experienced this while using itunes movies. This is the first and last amazon movie instant movie I purchase.<br /><br />iTunes lets you download to your hard drive so you can always watch it and not have to worry about your internet speed. Also the quality is much better (both picture and sound).
0201485672|4.0|If you have a certain knowledge about refactoring, this book might not be as valuable as if you were new to the concept.<br /><br />However, it contains a deep enough introduction and a reference to every important refactoring methods. For each of those methods, \\"pros/cons\\" and \\"when/when not\\" are listed to help you make the right choice.<br /><br />Most of the examples are really simple since it is easier to write, but it is intended to be applied to complex cases.<br /><br />I do recommend it, unless you have over 10 years of experience in refactoring already.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Out of question Dexter season 3 takes you to an Imaniganable level. It seems to me Dexter would like to have a friend in crime and allow his partner in crime to experience Dexter's killing rituals and stick to Dexter's killer codes. This season comes with mind blowing episodes and crazy twist...with Dexter. Michael C Hall did it once again.Season 4 is way better and a hint....he will try to bond with another partner in crime AGAIN. I hope it doesn't end like Miguel Prado..lolololol. Stay Tuned we have lots of Dexter more to come at least 10 seasons before Dexter gets caught.....sometime. Season 2 was chilling when Lundy called Dex' and show him the blood samples (Dexter's Trophies) anyway...stay tuned.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|This is a prequal to alien, but it was so convoluted as to be rediculous. To get an alien you must:<br />1) Engineers had to create a race of creatures from their own DNA, ie Humans<br />2) Create a weapon of mass destruction that kills you, the Engineer, and apparently turns humans, with the same DNA profile, into crazed killing machines<br />3) Have android randomly poison a human with said weapon of mass destruction<br />4) The poisoned person must have sex with someone and get them pregnant<br />5) She must remove the bastard offspring (face hugger apparently)<br />6) Trick an Engineer into getting impregnated by massive face hugger(which grew 100's of times its original size in hours without food)<br />7) Aliens are born<br /><br />WHAT THE HELL!? This was a fair scifi movie that was crammed into an existing universe.  This was worse than the Star Wars prequals.<br /><br />None of the characters was fleshed out in any way past the character Arch types.  Android follows orders to the best of his ability and makes poor choices.  Rich old man wants to live forever. Rich old mans daughter wants him to die so she can take over. Scientist seeking answers that he doesnt end up liking.<br /><br />Here are some questions to ask about the movie:<br />1-Why was the geologist, who mapped the structure, the one who got lost? Everyone else found their way out without any trouble.<br />2-Why would anyone take their helmets off on an alien planet, inside of an alien structure ever?<br />3-When lost, why would the Geoligist and random nice guy 1 stay in the chamber full of black flowing oozing liquid and then decide to play with the white snake creatures coming out of the black ooz? WHO THE HELL WOULD EVER DO THAT? \\"OH ITS SO CUTE LOOK IT WANTS TO PLAY\\"<br />4-How was the Engineers head, from an alien dead for thousands of years, \\"tricked\\" into thinking it was alive. These were creatures with the same DNA profile as humans.<br />5-Why leave a map to your chemical weapon factory? A factory which was creating a weapon so deadly it literally broke apart your DNA as it killed you? WHY LEAVE A MAP TO THAT LOCATION? It makes no sense, as it was created to infect humans, apparently.<br />6-Why was 1 of only 12 autodoctors, things so rare and valueable few people have ever seen them, on the space ship at all, and why would it not be programed for females, and if it wasnt programmed for females, how the hell did it perform a emergency C-section to remove an ALIEN Facehugger?<br /><br />The only alien seen was at the end, on an empty planet. That is how it ties into Alien.<br /><br />This movie is horrible. Save your money and either get it from net flix/amazon as a rental or steal it from online.  I feel like they owe me $ 13 and 2 hours of my life back.

I was surprised... the best part of all I paid nothin for this app because I got it when amazon was promoting it and was giving it out for the free app of the day... were talking about half a yr ago ... I see ppl paying .7.99 and getting a deal out of this well I guess I got the best deal out of everyone, it was free! I also got a new phone and tough u had lost all my &quot;free apps&quot; I had downloaded from amazon lol but turned out that when I downloaded the amazon app store and logged in with the same account I've always had with amazon my apps were saved in my account... I'm so happy because this was one the apps I had saved in my old phone! I love how well amazon is organized n make things easier for u! thanx amazon! love ur app store and ur website! I'm always ordering stuff from there and never have problems :)

B000002UB3|5.0|I know that no one will rea this review and I respect that however due to the beautiful quality of this album I am compelled 2. Now it takes a poet to define such an album in so few words however I think I have - A half hour orgasm. This is the only way to describe such a veritile and innovative album. Even if you do not like \\"old music\\" you can enjoy just how amazing this album is..let me describe every song...<br /><br />Something- this song is so heartfelt with soothing guitar melodies and riffs that in and of themselves describe the beautiful yet odd nature of the woman that george is succesfully attempting to capture in one song. The lyrics of this song capture the very essense of this woman and her distinct personalities.<br /><br />She came in throught the bathroom window- This song is a classic beatles song that sets the mood for the album and is just an interresting song. The lyrics describe a mysterious woman and her affect on her lover.<br /><br />Golden Slumbers- This song has sad piano that animates the sorrow in the heart of john lennon. T

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I must say \\"romance\\" novels isnt normally me thing...but this book blew me away WOAH!!! The story is GREAT..Characters are GREAT...I could NOT put this down I had it read in less the 24 hours!! I have searched EVERYWHERE around me to find book two and finally found it today!!! I have started it and so far its just as GREAT!!! WONDERFUL!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was great!! I loved the characters attitues and the way the story was told. I often thought I had the book figured out but to my surprise the was a twist. I wouls suggest this book to any looking for a non-so-typical love story. I was not able to put this book down and read it with in days.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I finally got around to seeing John Carter. When I first saw previews for the movie, its resemblance to Star Wars was uncanny. Then I found out the movie is based off a series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs that came out in the early 1900's.<br /><br />So it turns out, Star Wars resembles the books which in turn causes John Carter the movie to resemble Star Wars. It's a whole chicken and egg thing.<br /><br />But anyway, I'll start right off with saying that if you have read the books, be prepared for some changes to the story. Personally, I found the changes, such as the look and role of the Therns, to be jolting. The problem with reading a book and seeing a movie is you expect the same thing. So when things are switched up, it becomes a little confusing as you try to unlearn what you already know.<br /><br />If you never read the books, I think this movie will be a lot more enjoyable. There is plenty of action, great characters, and a decent plot. Andrew Stanton does a great job transitioning his animated directing experience with Pixar into a live action/animated film with John Carter.<br /><br />And yes, as you watch it, you'll sometimes feel the uncanny similarities the movie has with Star Wars. What with words like Jeddak being thrown around and names of creatures like Banths, how could you not?<br /><br />My one gripe comes with the ending, but I think it has more to do with a lack of confidence in getting a chance to do a sequel to the movie. In the first book, it ends with a clear cliffhanger. The movie almost does the same thing, but in its final moments it resolves the potential cliffhanger and wraps everything up. Something tells me the higher ups at Disney requested this in the event the movie bombed.<br /><br />And, well, it did. So it was probably a good decision that they did that overall.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you like good action, stories with princesses, and brave heroes, give John Carter a try. Sit back, have fun, and enjoy the ride!
B006LSZECO|2.0|It skips around and is hard to follow. Each chapter goes back and forth. You will need some serious quiet time to concentrate on this book. The story line was good, the ending bad.
0345803485|1.0|50 Shades of crap is what this book should be called.  Now I hate to disparage anyone's writing, but this really takes the cake.  I'd heard so much about this book and was eager to read it.  Right now I'm about halfway through and not sure if I'll be able to finish it.  My inner Goddes is begging me for mercy saying please stop, please stop!  You're killing me here.  The writing reminds me of the Twilight series, which was quite honestly pretty torturous to get through and the only reason I did was so that I could ok it for my kid to read. I think I ruined it for her because I just couldn't stand the whining Bella!<br /><br />I keep expecting Christian to grow fangs and bite Anastaaaasia.  And what is up with these names?  Anastasia?  Really?  Another thing that reminds me of Bella is the clumsy virgin factor.  So she's clumsy, she's a virgin, then all of a sudden she's a sex-obsessed vixen who keeps biting her lip, which of course drives Christian WILD!<br /><br />And at this stage in my life if anyone tried to control me the way Mr. Control Freak Christian does, I'd give him 2 seconds of my time.  I don't care how much money he has, I'd tell him where he could put that tie.<br /><br />If this is what is passing as \\"popular\\" fiction, I am just speechless.  For crying out loud at least make the characters likeable.  I don't care for any of these characters.  So what they have sex?  Everyone has sex and if I wanted to read sex, I'd read Penthouse Forum.  At least there it's not cluttered with unlikeable characters.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|i enjoyed the writer's character development. it was an interesting perspective for a romance - two broken kids approaching love. i don't condone violence and still found the story entertaing. ultimately the romance lives up to the book's title. i'll be looking for more from this author!
0061928356|5.0|I loved this book and it's been one of the best books I've read all year. It's an easy read, but it's still interesting and thought-provoking. I fell in love with each of the chararcters, especially Asha. I particularly loved how the author wrote the book from the perspective of each character. I can't wait until she writes another book and I'd highly recommend this read!
B007VDPE32|4.0|I purchased the whole album based on Rufus Wainright's performance on the Tonite Show with Jay Leno.  I was out of town and the songs gave me a particular comfort for some odd reason.  I'm usually not even a listener to this genre of music.  Overall Out of the Game - the title song has the most appeal, but I also like the song about hanging out at a Respectable Dive.  Cool track.<br />Keep true to your music.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Satisfied.

B0000CABJ1|5.0|I am so sad that she died.  Many memories of mine are associated with her songs.  This CD brought all those memories back.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Recent pop history is littered with long delayed comebacks. Steely Dan is one example that comes to mind. Sometimes it's the better creative choice. Other times no one knows why it happened. Donna Summer for her part barely made a peak out into the music world during the 1990's,even during the disco revival. And the one time she did,she was still gaming to be on the more contemporary side of things. But her original sound never came close to dying out. In fact many others expanded on that. One could in fact say she was the original dance diva. At the same time what was the \\"Queen Of Disco\\" going to do in a world populated by artists aspiring for the same title? All she had to do was make a comeback and everyone easily stepped aside and let her in. After all,dance music after the turn of the millenium as with a lot of things was showing signs of growing more than a little stale and predictable. Again Donna was needed,if nothing else than to show the newer generation coming up just \\"how it was done\\".<br /><br />  On this album Donna Summer was not the starstruck and  naive seeming  young lady she was at the start of her career. This Donna is confident,aware and KNOWS how to work an audience. \\"Stamp Your Feet\\",\\"Mr.Music\\" , \\"The Queen Is Back\\"  and \\"Fame (The Game) are smack in the middle of the contemporary hard electropop dance/club sound but compositionally and lyrically still 100% Donna Summer. She'd actually rediscovered an interest in her dancefloor adventures from the point of view of someone middle aged physically but ageless in spirit. The title song is an exciting modern Afro-electric style song about cultural tolerance with Ziggy Marley. Actually one of my favorites here. \\"Sand On My Feet\\" is actually a quiant guitar oriented indie pop type ballad. Of course my favorite here is \\"Drivin Down Brazil\\",this melodically wonderous samba that I feel goes down with Summer's all time classic songs. \\"I'm A Fire\\" is back to full on,no holds barred Munich style Eurodisco and a powerful return to Donna's classic sound.<br /><br />  On \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" Donna throws down a genuine R&B song,heavy on the funk and giving us a taste of that multi farious voice of hers,coming at us with a vocal a lot closer to the whiskey soaked howl of Macy Gray. On \\"Science Of Love\\" it's one of the more penetrating dance numbers as the music isn't as overwelming. \\"Be Myself Again\\" is a more personal ballad reflecting on her comeback with some mild electro touches. The closer \\"Bring Down The Reign\\" gets very African oriented as,to a degree it sort of offers up a follow on to ideas baught forth more than two decades earlier on \\"State Of Independence\\".  The more one listens to this album,the more it just gets to you. One might expect Donna Summer to remain in one time or place forever. But she never even pretends to do that here. It's clear down to  the crown shaped eyeliner in her lashes in the cover art that the only way for her to have remained the queen of her musical domain was to innovate on a contemporary sound. And she's looking at that here in every respect. Not sure if this will have to go down as her final album. But if it is to be that way,no harm done. It's a testement to her legacy all around.and a powerful return to Donna's classic sound.<br /><br />  On \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" Donna throws down a genuine R&B song,heavy on the funk and giving us a taste of that multi farious voice of hers,coming at us with a vocal a lot closer to the whiskey soaked howl of Macy Gray.

B0086700CM|4.0|In Temple Run you play as Guy Dangerous who has just stolen a golden idol from the temple, a la Indiana Jones.  You are being chased by ghost monkeys and must basically run through a maze for as long as possible.  Along the way you can collect coins, which can be exchanged for power-ups to be used on future runs.  So running through a maze, being chased by ghosts collecting dots--I mean coins--where have I played that game before?  Oh yeah, Ms. Pacman.  This game is really just a love child of Indiana Jones and Ms. Pacman.  Nothing wrong with that--4 stars!

B0052VUNHC|3.0|No, the book is not a disaster at all. I enjoyed it but it saddens me that it could have been much more.<br /><br />The book is beautiful but I feel sad after reading it. I am sad because the book could have been what it promised in the first chapters. Why did the heroine made a firm decision then reversed it without a lot of thought, just feelings. The author was maybe trying to reach a number of words with some unnecessary unbelievable scenes like some of what happened in Vegas.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have liked to enlarged the scene on my kindle. Already purchased the sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this app because I have the game on my laptop. I can pretty much garuntee that you will become addicted to this game. I know I am. I hope you enjoy the game. I highly recomend this game to anyone who has plenty of time on their hands.
B004LROUW2|1.0|Page after page, nothing continued to happen. Literally nothing. Well, a couple of things.<br /><br />1. Moon gazing. What color was the second one? Hazy purple? Bronze?? Oh, ha ha, you big silly, it was mentioned only a billion times that it's smaller and greenish, how could you forget?. Pshaw.<br />2. Boiling water and drinking a beer.<br />4. You learn that Aomame=Green Peas. Did ya know that?? Did ya?? Read this book and you'll never forget! And it's UNUSUAL in Japan to be called Green Peas! FYI!!<br />3. Stretching. Just an ungodly amount of stretching. All the time with the stretching. Will they ever get loose??<br /><br />I have to say, I have read some massive tomes in my life. The Stand. The Executioner's Song. Infinite Jest. Length doesn't scare me. You know what scares me? Losing hours of my life to stuff that sucks.<br /><br />This is my first Murakami. Yeah, yeah. A shame, I know.<br /><br />I actually came to Amazon to post a review because this book made me so mad.<br /><br />NOTE: This review offers more insight into my character than the 920-something pages of character 'development' in that book.<br /><br />PS: There is NO WAY two people can sit side by side at the top of a playground slide. Just sayin'
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I finally completed this game all ten lvs. some of the lvs 6 &amp; up were a little harder but I got it. it was so fun. the hardest Lvl for me was Lvl 9 -2 hardest lvl but still really fun hope u enjoy. Ps u should download this app its worth it
0439023521|2.0|I read this because of all the hype surrounding it. I should know better! It was very disappointing because I was expecting something much better than this. It's not the worst book I've ever read, but it's not very good. It is also written in the first person, and I personally prefer third person omniscient narration. I dislike first person because it makes it impossible for the reader to know anything that is going on outside of the protagonist's view, and in the hands of a mediocre author, it makes for a very poor story.<br /><br />To begin with, there were too many plot holes, and the characterization was very poor. When I finished this book, I honestly didn't even care what happened to any of the characters. They could all die, including the protagonist, and I wouldn't miss any of them. That's not really what you want to go for when writing a book. I felt the author has a poor sense of humanity and history. I find it absurd that people would allow their children to be taken from them without any sort of protest. There should have been permanent civil unrest. Death is no deterrent. There are things that are much worse than being killed, like having your twelve year old daughter taken from you.<br /><br />I also felt the author is simply pandering to unthinking teenage girls by writing a sanitized novel that wouldn't offend anyone. There is no mention of religion or political ideology, so what exactly runs this continent wide dictatorship? If Hitler couldn't keep a dictatorship going for more than a few years in an area as small as Germany, what sort of person could run one over an entire continent for so long? No one is the correct answer.<br /><br />I also felt the author had never hunted (or bothered to research hunting) and had never been to the area she had written about. It supposedly takes place in the Appalachian mountains near West Virginia or maybe western North Carolina/eastern Tennessee. I'm not sure she knows how important religion is to the people who live there. You would never be able to get it out of them, not in a million years.<br /><br />Stupidity apparently does sell, and quite well. I find it ironic that the author wrote this book as a reaction to reality television, because I feel the book is written about as well as one of those shows. Most don't think very much about the media that is being fed to them. If someone says it is supposed to be good then they believe it is, whether that is true or not.<br /><br />The overall premise was interesting, and perhaps some of the above wouldn't have bothered me so much if the author had actually written a good story with well developed characters (see: Willing Suspension of Disbelief). If you are wondering whether you should read it, I wouldn't bother.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Very addictive and a ton of fun. I know I got it for free but definately worth the purchase. Thanks Amazon FA of the Day.
B00881VLCE|1.0|this game was fun for like 10 minutes after that it just started to get boring.I uninstalled it after just one puzzle.
B008469DGY|5.0|one of the best golf games on the market!!!<br />definently recommended to others (even if u don't like golf)!!!!<br />Fun game
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I did not like this book at all, gave it one star only.  It was a very juvenile read in my opinion. The storyline, characters and the writing were for a 13 year old.  His best \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" were 5 star books, then things seem to go like a comet into the sun (downhill) with \\"The Last Colony\\", \\"Agent to the Stars\\", \\"Fuzzy Nation\\" all getting at the most 2 stars.  Now the bottom of the ratings.  I think this will be my last of his books (paid $11.99 on Kindle) and should get my money back.<br /><br />I will not go into the story-line, many other reviews have already done this so I will just rate the book on its elements (1 to 5 being highest):<br /><br />Protagonist Development: 1<br />Antagonist Development: 1<br />Minor Character Development: 1<br />Storyline: -1<br />Setting: 1<br />Theme: -1<br />Writing Style: -1<br />Overall Rating: 1
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has a little of everything and you don't run out of coins very quickly. I enjoyed it a lot.
044024630X|4.0|Reacher is like Sherlock Holmes and Bruce Lee put together as one person. This crime (a serial killer is loose) is tough to solve but Reacher does get to the bottom of it. He isn't shy about getting justice also, in or outside the law. Very good job as with all Reacher novels.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|After receiving much hype about the Hunger Games, I decided I'd finally download a copy to my kindle and read it, as I had gotten a gift card. The series is all over lately, so I had figured it would be a fun read. I thought wrong.<br /><br />The concept itself is beautiful, however the quality of writing was awful. I had trouble getting into the character's head simply because I felt like a child could have written it.  I powered through them, as I make it a point to try and finish things I pay for, but it was difficult and I ended up reading another novel along with it just to keep me wanting to read. Ultimately, I was very disappointed. If you're someone who is able to look past terrible writing quality and just enjoy the plot and characters, I'm sure it's a fantastic read and is worth the acclaim it gets, but I am not one of those people, and struggled through every chapter.
0345803485|1.0|It's not the book itself that is problem.  It is the way it was made.  My first day of sitting down to read the book the first 4 pages fell out.  I let that slide thinking maybe they just didn't get bound well.  Now I'm just past the 1/2 way point and more pages have fallen out in 3 different places.  Needless to say it makes it hard to read as I'm holding pages in and those loose ones are getting damaged from being re-inserted and falling out.  I hope volume II and III are better and my whole serious doesn't go to pieces.
B005HSL626|5.0|people need to stop whining about the adds thrybwill be every where this game is fun and chalenging and yea there r some adds but just watch your kids and make sure they don't do bad things
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of my favorite games. I  recommended it. once you get a lot off money you can buy things. but as most games are it gets harder as you go through the game!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first read the reviews on this book, I said I have no interest in reading it. Then everyone started talking about it and asked if I read it.  So I purchased the book on Amazon and I ended up loving it. The sexual parts are not all that bad and the story is intriguing.  Î found I could not put the book down and could not wait until I found out what else they would or where their relationship would go. I am now up to the third book and can't wait until I get to the end. The story keeps me on my toes.  I highly recommend this book.
B007ZT2Q88|3.0|\\"Apres\\" does not showcase the blow torch intensity we have come to expect from the godfather of punk.  In fact it sounds like Iggy has morphed into Edith Piaf.  Strange perhaps but Iggy's beautiful bass baritone sounds like it was tailor made for this material. He has always been a crooner.<br /><br />The first track \\"Et sit u n'existais pas\\" has an extremely catchy hook and an ambiance somewhere between burlesque strip tease and the Muslim call to prayer. The songs all feature understated acoustic guitar and stand up bass. Who could have foreseen Iggy covering songs like \\"Everybody's Talking\\" (my personal favorite) or \\"Michelle\\"?  I do wish there were a few more covers in English. The proportion of French to English songs seems a bit off kilter. Iggy could have covered \\"The Wichita Lineman\\", \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\" or any number of easy listening classics from the 1970s.<br /><br />That's Iggy for you. Just when you think you've got him pegged he does something completely different to throw you off the scent. In a career full of long shots, near misses and wrong turns Iggy has frequently flirted with new directions. Some of them fail. Others pay off.  This one pays off for the most part. Instinct keeps him running like a deer. Long may he run.
1932073221|5.0|I have highlighted so many passages in this book, I could have highlighted the entire book.<br /><br />This book is life changing for those who don't know that our thought influence our reality. It's very reaffirming and educating for those who already have ideas about changing their reality according to their thoughts, but don't really know how to attract money (financial abundance).<br /><br />Most importantly, this book is not about getting rich, but about learning how to attract as much money as we think we need and deserve to have. It makes very clear that living a fulfilled life, self-love and listening to one's intuition (or higher self) are the keys for a great life. Having enough money is a direct result of getting the other things straight.<br /><br />This book doesn't just make you feel good about making money, it teaches you a lot about life in general, so that you can learn to make money for the highest good of all.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|From the moment I heard classics like \\"Stupid Girl\\" and \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" I was hooked!  Garbage use the sophisticated technology of modern pop, sharpen it to a razor's edge and stab musical conformity in the heart! Shirley Manson is simultaneously seductive and menacing. She croons, whispers, howls, and soars; multiple layers of angelic girl scout gone serial killer. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker rarely fail to deliver anything less than musical excellence and an apocalyptic creative vision.<br /><br />\\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" delivers nothing less than classic, primo; grade A Garbage!  (What? You were expecting something else?) The album sounds like they picked up where they left off without taking a break. All of the songs are great. There is not a dud in the bunch. I purchased the deluxe version.<br /><br />The production on this CD is HUGE! The mix is rich, deep, chock full of moving parts and delicious effects! I am sure it will provide many happy hours of listening pleasure as I unearth fresh layers of previously undiscovered sound.<br /><br />This band has always been brilliant. \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" proves they have not lost a thing.  I can only hope they do not wait another 7 years before releasing their next CD. Garbage are very definitely my kind of people.

B000001G5A|1.0|What is one to say of a performance of the Requiem that is actually more dead than the poor bugger in the box?<br /><br />By all means bring out the grandeur of the score - it warrants it - but why transform K 626 into an elegy for the Nineteenth Century?<br /><br />This is Obesity Central; everything about this recording is bloated and coarsely so. I would not be surprised to hear that the Huddersfield Choral Society, circa 1910, was somehow involved in this venture. Worse still, Uncle Karl makes Erich Honecker seem like Jim Morrison. He's uber-slow, mechanical and more funereal than an undertaker. Listen to the Rex Tremendae: Uncle Karl might as well be driving a tractor on his potato farm. Nor is he helped by the thousand-strong choir (if Lenny was in town at the time, they should have tackled the Mahler 8th in the same session). Again, listen to the Rex Tremendae and their first entry: how crude it is - and the opacity of the recording means that there is little or no differentiation between the SATB. The shrieks of the Damned are to be heard in the Confutatis but it has nothing to do with Hell.  The Agnus Dei is almost unlistenable - it sounds like a Brahms Requiem on steroids but that is doing a disservice to Johannes. The Vienna Philharmonic play well enough  - for Bruckner. Edith Mathis, normally one of my favourite singers, sounds as if she is trying to emulate Joan Baez in her over-use of vibrato; Ridderdbusch lacks `sepulchral resonance' in his lower register. The tenor and alto are OK but nothing special.<br /><br />Ever so thoughtfully, DG has bolted together the Requiem Aeternam with the Kyrie (there is no separate track listening for the latter). There are synergies here with Dr Who's Tardis whose physical dimensions were belied by its interior. Here, the clock says it lasts 9'39\\" (which is frightful in itself), but in actual fact it is your chance to be Methuselah. And indeed, who does not feel penitential after hearing this Kyrie . . .<br /><br />Speaking of which, it is time for a . . . . . . . `Soup Off'. Yes, Uncle Karl versus Herbie the Chef (re his 1963 recording [[ASIN:B00005MJ17 Mozart: Requiem KV 626]]). Who is the Soup-Meister? Mister Minestrone or Maestro Chick-Pea Broth? It is not easy to answer this question. Both of them are marmoreal, lugubrious and afflicted with a terrible recording.  There is a suavity to the Herbie performance which predicates control even if it is noxious to the listener. Uncle Karl should win this on points: his choir is clearly off the leash.<br /><br />Bohm was a fine Mozartian but this travesty does little to keep his memory evergreen. Say what you like about Period Practice - and I have said plenty - nowadays monstrosities of this mettle are unthinkable and for that we should offer up a Te Deum.<br /><br />With all due disrespect to the Herbie '63 - and I have my suspicions re [[ASIN:B000F0UVSG Mozart: Requiem - Rudolf Kempe, Berlin Philharmonic, Choir of St. Hedwigs Cathedral]] - this is the worst K 626 on the market.<br /><br />My recommendations:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000026GD1 Mozart: Requiem]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000007BI Mozart: Requiem]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000001GK8 Mozart: Requiem / Tomowa-Sintow, M&uuml;ller Molinari, Cole, Burchuladze; von Karajan]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005QVK2 Mozart: Requiem (The S&uuml;ssmayr Version and the Original Unfinished Version)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006LL030E Requiem]]eaking of which, it is time for a . . . . . . . `Soup Off'.

B005L38QK2|1.0|This is my first feedback on Amazon in years.  I own a very successful video game company, and was looking forward to playing Diablo 3 with this specialized gaming mouse.  But, when it arrived and I hooked it up, I immediately stopped using it because the mouse wheel skips and is basically too imprecise.  I contacted the company that makes it and they said I had to return it through Amazon, but because I travel so much and so on, I ended up missing my window to get a refund.  (Although, I'm sending the mouse back to Amazon anyway, because I certainly don't need a mouse that doesn't do what it's designed to do.)<br /><br />Maybe I got a one-off defective mouse, because I see good reviews here.  But I certainly wouldn't trust my luck again with getting another one.
0684859106|4.0|I bought this cookbook, because of a red velvet cupcake, purchased at The Magnolia Bakery in Greenwich Village.  I devoured the eBook, from cover to cover in several settings.  I have was eager to try one of these beautifully written recipes, in hopes of recapturing the sense memory of eating that red velvet cupcake. I finally got up the courage to make one of the recipes, the Coconut Layer Cake for Father's Day.  This book offers some fantastic tips in the beginning to set you up for success, when trying on these recipes.  I read the recipe several times, and began the process.  The end result was a fantastic layer cake, that received rave reviews from the crowd.  My parents compared it to the cakes of their childhood.  My seven year old nephew, who never finishes a piece of cake, ate his piece from top to bottom.  I would recommend this cookbook to anyone, who is up for a baking challenge, with a fantastic end result. I will most likely, purchase the two others in the collection.  Up next from this book, the Humming Bird Cake...

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I read a few reviews prior to seeing this movie and expected to not enjoy it- but the reviewers were WRONG!  This was a great movie and all of the actors were excellent especially Tom Cruise- who should receive an award.  Especially based on the fact that all the actors are really singing and sound just as good as the original bands that made the songs great. My husband didn't realize that it was a musical and usually refuses to see any movie where the actors sing- but he loved this! If you're 50 or more and love ROCK as much as my husband and I do- watch this movie & sing along like my husband and I did & everyone else in the theatre!  It was a blast!

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|To start with the viewer will note that the wolf behavior is highly dramatized, even has a supernatural feel. However, the movie does a good job of offering reasons a wolf pack 'might' behave with such aggression. Forget all that, this isn't really too much about the wolves behavior, other than on the surface. I felt the thrill of a Jack London adventure tale (which I adore). Not only is it Man vs. Nature, but it is Man vs. Man and Man vs. Himself all rolled into one and in the most extreme. The biggest obstacle the main character truly has to overcome is his past and the ability to choose life over death in the first place. If you were left out in nature what would keep you going forward? Why do some people become leaders and others just give up? What in your past has shaped who you are in your future? There were so many layers of questions about human nature and a deeper thread wound through this story that I can hardly see it as just a life and death adventure tale. One particular scene really spooked me (and I had to watch a couple times). When they are pursued by the wolves and standing by the fire look closely at the tree line...very eerie effect. It has a very symbolic 'shadow of death' quality I couldn't help but admire. I recall a time up in Leadville, Colorado when I heard wolves in the far distance. It was both beautiful and haunting at the same time. I swore I saw this in the tree line as I looked at the snow on the ground that night under the moonlight. I quickly retreated to my car and slept there rather than my tent! I got the same chill up my spine while I watched this movie. Very well done. Just keep in mind that as with Jaws and other movies like it that this is 'over the top' Hollywood drama, not necessarily true animal behavior.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this book for my kindle and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!! I cannot sing enough praise about it. Yes, it is not literary genius, but I love it all the same.

030758836X|5.0|This thriller had me guessing at every turn.  Just when I began to form an opinion or believe I had it figured out, Ms. Flynn threw in a new twist.  I loved it!  The suspense and intrigue kept me guessing at every turn.  I could not put this book down and found myself totally engrossed.  From sad, mad, compassionate to furious to an ending that takes you by surprise, it is unlike any mystery I have ever read.  If you love mysteries without the predictable storyline and ending, this one's for you!

B006PTL1GC|4.0|I am not a psychologist or a psychoanalyst or into those intellectual  fields at all.  I heard of Freud's monumental book in college, attempted to read it but failed to grasp.  I also heard of Jung then but never really read knew his significance.  But, years later,  I came across Jung's book, \\" Memories, Dreams and Reflections\\" and bought it.  I was interested in the insights of an elderly man.<br /><br />For me, Jung's book was hard to understand but I read on because I could get bits of knowledge here and there.  And by the time I got to the end,  my view of life was clearer.  There is order in this world \\"... it is I who is clouded \\" .<br /><br />The movie lets you see these intellectuals as regular people.  I got an idea of their town , the houses, the families, the community...things we all have as regular people.  If you read their books, this movie is a chance to \\"meet\\" the writers behind the books.  And see how pristine the circles they lived around.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender as Jung is a sure bonus.  As I like both of them.

030758836X|4.0|This is the second book I have read by this author, the first being Dark Places. While I loved the book, thought it was well written, devious, imaginative, at times hysterical (ok well maybe it's me) the end was somewhat unsatisfying. I guess books are just what the reade makes them. I will say, it reminds me of a 21st century remake of the movie War of the Roses.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm just thankful I didn't actually pay for these books - a friend let me borrow her's. If I had bought them, I'd be disappointed AND angry.<br /><br />So much hype about this? Really? I like to read a good erotic romance. And the romping scenes weren't too bad. But all other dialog or inner musings were repetitive and annoying.<br /><br />If you're still too curious to pass up these books - I suggest you borrow them. Because you'll instantly regret spending $30+ on this trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book.  Even though it had some far-fetched moments, it is a story, and extremely entertaining.  I can't wait to start book two!
0470913029|5.0|This book is a life style changer, and the change is with better health, and I highly recommend this book<br />to ALL.  I have done many ways of eating,...vegan, vegetarian, raw foodist, and more. This book shows us how our Paleolithic hunter-gatherer ancestors ate according to their genetic make-up, and how well this healthy life style works with our digestive systems, and overall well being.  I thought I was healthy before going Paleo, however, now I have surpassed the \\"healthy\\" way I was, and have noticed the distinct, positive changes I have experienced and I have only been on the Paleo life style for just under a month!<br />Get the book, read it, and give it your best try, and methinks you won't regret doing so!<br />Good health to ALL of you!<br />Cheers! :)
0553801473|5.0|I was surprised by the number of negative reviews for a book that recently won the 2012 Locus Award for fantasy, but you can't please everyone.<br /><br />I've read all of the current ASOIAF books twice through, and I'm currently on my 3rd re-read (1/2-way through ACOK). What I've found is what will hopefully be (once completed) my favorite fantasy series of all time, but I won't know that until it is completed (if it ever is).<br /><br />For me, each consecutive volume has been better than the previous. I LOVE ADWD, it's the best book Martin's ever published in my view, and I hope he continues to take his time and perfect his masterpiece at his own pace so that the end result is as satisfying as the currently published volumes.<br /><br />I know all of the counter-arguments to this point of view, and disagree. The plot hasn't become bogged down, it's setting up all of the threads for the payoff. In series you're going to have to accept exposition (and when it's of such high quality, how can you really complain?) in order to get to the payoff, and I have every confidence that the payoff for ASOIAF will be one worth waiting for.
0920668372|5.0|I think it's easy for some people to read too much into the details (analysis paralysis ?) of this book and miss the bigger point of the story, which is a mother's undying and unconditional love for her child and how, eventually, he comes to the full realization that what's she's given him, he's to give to his child. I think the deeper moral of this story is profound and beautiful, and one that caught me by surprise emotionally when I read it to my son.
B000M5B6Q0|3.0|I saw Music & Lyrics in the movie theater and I loved the catchy, Wham inspired music of the 80s, and the more modern sounds of Haley Bennett's character Cora. I couldn't wait to find a copy of the soundtrack. It took 5yrs to find it. First of all, you can tell the actors did these cuts at the end of the movie to put on the soundtrack. The soundtrack versions of these songs are lackluster at best. Their voices sounded so much better in the movie. I noticed they had the demo version of \\"A Way Back Into Love\\" with Drew Barrymore and then the one with Hugh Grant & Haley Bennett. I was hoping for the concert version of \\"A Way Back Into Love\\". The concert version was so much better than with just the piano. The piano was nice for the demo but for a finale the concert version was awesome! And the way Hugh & Haley sang it at the end was excellent. I also wondered why they didn't include Cora's sticky and steamy intro to \\"Way Back Into Love.\\" Though it was the same song each one had their own different flavor. The demo had the piano, steamy & sticky had a foreign sound with a slight beat, and of course the concert version.<br /><br />During the credits there is a song called \\"Invincible\\" by Cora Corman. I was disappointed that it was omitted from the soundtrack. The only way to hear this is during the credits at the end of the movie. Why couldn't they have omitted #6 Tony The Beat or #11. Different Sound Featuring Malte? They weren't featured in the movie and sound completely out of place. For those of you who don't watch the credits, here are the lyrics to \\"Invincible\\"<br /><br />(Bang Bang)<br /><br />Boy I remember when this thing first started<br />And people said it wouldn't last<br />But it's still growin' like an English garden<br />And we're just layin' in the grass<br /><br />Sometimes the rumors start floatin' around but I promise<br />They can say whatever they want this loves invincible<br />They can try to shoot off their mouths, boy<br />They only want what wegot this loves invincible<br />They can never turn us around, boy<br /><br />(Bang Bang)<br /><br />Sometimes the rumors start floatin' around but I promise<br />They can say whatever they want this loves invincible<br />They can try to shoot off their mouths, boy<br />But they only want what we got this loves invincible<br />They can never turn us around, boy<br /><br />They can say whatever they want (echo)

B005974CNA|2.0|A dramatic turn of events... that's what the band has come to. This review is coming from a die hard fan who has bought every album, learned the songs, formed a cover band, and blah blah blah. Any way, this band's music has been something I've held near and dear for a while now and lets face it a band who stays together for 20+ years and creates this music owes NOTHING to fans like me. That being said I'm very close to the point of remembering this band of what it was.<br /><br />I could be wrong, the times have become tough and maybe the band will sound different on a future cd. I feel like most fans just give this cd a five star rating because it's dream theater and nothing they have wrote is sub par, but the thing is that this is sub par. Every time dream theater has been on the verge of releasing a cd I've been really excited as with this one. Ever since they leaked on the backs of angels( a good song) on the internet I practically frothed at the mouth wating for the release date. As soon as the release date came around I gathered my fellow friend and dream theater nerd to head to find a store that sold it and bought the new cd. Since we already listened to on the backs of angels a thousand times we decided to listen to track two- build me up, break me down.<br /><br />I think our reaction to that song is the way that most 5 star reviewers and fans treat this album. We smiled for the new album, bobbed our heads, and PRETENDED to like what we were hearing. Honestly that song has to be the worst thing dream theater has ever created, it sounds like really bad metallica. I didn't let that stop us from listening though, we still absorbed as much as we could until we reached the final track, breaking all illusions, the greatest track on the album-a breath of life. I've listened to the album several times through conviced that I loved it and it was a \\"classic\\", but about the fourth or fith time through reality finally hit me, this album wasn't really that good and actually boring with the exception of two songs, and I'm okay with that.<br /><br />Dream theater has done more than enough for their fans and has inspired me to become a musician rather than a guitarist and even opened up my tastes to genres other than rock or metal. This album just lacks the life that inspired me on so many levels and honestly is boring, even after several indvidual track listens I can't remember how some of the songs like outcry even begin, and I'm not at all intrigued to do so either! Why should I expect anything better than previous albums though seriously, these guys are in their mid 40's! I see this album as a withering flower, it's mostly dying but still beautiful and more importantly has inspired others like circus maximus to grow like it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|To be fair, the book is entertaining in an \\"I'm interested in getting off at work while not blatantly watching porn\\" type of way, but the good qualities end there. The writing is terrible, I mean the kind of terrible that makes anyone who can read past a 4th grade level cringe. Even the complexity of the book's theme fails to help the characters become any more dimensional. The chapters that are dedicated solely to 'The Contract' and their email conversations seem to serve no other purpose than to give the reader a nap in between the sex scenes. The main character is annoyingly innocent, looking at the world with a wide eyed wonder that doesn't suit a college graduate that is about to enter a BDSM relationship. While I'm sure that Anastasia's innocence is meant to make her seem endearing in the reader's eye, it does nothing more than make most sane people want to gag.<br /><br />The reason why I gave this book three stars instead of one is because in spite of all of it's faults, the sex scenes are fun and never failed to make my breath catch. I will say two words in this book's favor; Riding Crop.

B004EPZ06G|3.0|I readily admit I was curious to watch this sequel of the hilariously successful original; I wanted to see if the filmmakers could come up with some original material to make the guys' second black out believable.  Alas, THE HANGOVER PART II is a retread--and often a tired retread--only here the raunch is vigorously ratcheted up.  From missing digits to drug overdose to transgendered shenanigans to Mike Tyson tweaking supreme annoyance with ease, this sequel definitely bends the envelope, and does have some laugh-out-loud moments, but if you've seen (and enjoyed) the original offering you can rest assured there is really no new ground covered in the sequel.<br /><br />The original foursome (Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis) return as Phil, Doug, Stu, and Alan; and this time Stu is wedding an Asian/American girl (Jamie Chung) in her native Thailand.  Stu wants no part of a bachelor party, yet upon arrival to the Orient he consents to the guys having one beer on the beach--and naturally the guys (sans Doug, who we discover leaves the get-together early and returns to the hotel, but adding Stu's future brother-in-law Teddy, played by Mason Lee) wake up the next morning in a rundown hotel in Bangkok with no memory of the night before, and missing young Teddy.  Of course, this sequel wouldn't be complete without the antics of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), who once again makes his appearance in all his natural glory.  Thus the manhunt for Teddy commences, as Stu, Phil, and Alan slowly piece together the events of a very busy evening, augmented by a faux ransom fronted by an undercover cop (Paul Giamatti), and, as before, just as the wedding appears doomed Stu solves the mystery, Teddy is found, there's a mad scramble to get back in time for the wedding, with (another)dramatic entrance.  And as if this sequel hasn't borrowed from its predecessor enough, Stu once again gets to ping another person, only this time it's his future father-in-law (Nirut Sirichanya).  Again, there are very funny moments to THE HANGOVER PART II, and all the antics are delivered as vigorously as before, but a retread is a retread is a retread.  So my curiosity is satisfied--my indifference is not.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.nya).

B005HEU202|5.0|That trickster Q re-appears and forces the Enterprise to confront the Borg for the first time.<br /><br />One is left wondering why a nervous crew doesn't heed the advice to flee (they should have!), nor destroys the damaged Borg cube.  But, then we'd not have as much plot development later.  An interesting episode!<br /><br />I'm rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF, in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired.  They really do hold up more than 2 decades later-- more than can be said for most TV.  Enjoy!
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. I was thrilled with how matched turned out, and finished it within days. I couldn't wait to get my hands on crossed. unfortunately my standards were too high, and I got worked up over nothing with this book. I took MONTHS to read this book, and found that it wasn't written as well as I had wished. to be honest, the only reason I finished it was I needed to return it to the school library before it closed for the summer. I thought that all the action would come in spurts. I would read multiple chapters in a day, then not read any for weeks.<br /><br />I must admit, I'm looking forward to the arrival of reached.
0984999302|2.0|I was tempted by this from an excerpt I saw on the web. Sadly, it follows the usual pattern of business books: an interesting idea that could be explained in a couple of pages, expanded by means of much repitition and many almost identical anecdotes, to fill a complete book. The idea is sound enough: don't build a plan and then execute it slavishly, thereby ending up with a product nobody wants. Instead, find yourself some customers early on, continuously get their feedback, and be prepared to reinvent your product and company, possibly several times. There, I just saved you the purchase price. All the examples are drawn from Web 2.0 type businesses, and the title should really be \\"The Web Service Startup Owners Manual\\". Web-delivered services, such as social networking, lend themselves very well to continuous revision - there is no deployed software to update, and changes are cheap and easy. This of course is why such companies are so fashionable amongst VCs. The concept is much harder to apply to a traditional software or infrastructure company, and pretty well impossible with hardware or silicon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Just downloaded this app yesterday and really like it.  It has very nice graphics and different difficulty levels which makes it great for a wide range of ages.  I have hit the ads a few times while trying to select a puzzle piece but it's not that big a deal since the app is free.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really didn't want to give this one star but I had to rate it, although it doesn't even deserve half a star! Ok - I guess the women and men who loved this book must not read often and certainly have a very dull sex life. I'm an avid reader and found Fifty Shades of Grey a real snoozer. I got through not quite 3/4 of it and just couldn't finish it as it was so STUPID! I kept hoping for something exciting to happen, but it didn't! Don't waste your money - it sucks!

B005LAIH3G|4.0|The movie critic Richard Roeper negatively compared John Carter to Star Wars meets Cowboys & Aliens & Avatar. I never saw Cowboys and Aliens, but I love me some Star Wars, and honestly, this movie entertained me much more than Avatar and wasn't nearly as preachy as Cameron's movie was. Yes, you will see hints of Star Wars and Avatar in this movie, but I found this movie just a fun, \\"magical\\", and an \\"old timey\\" adventure that made me feel young at heart. This film reminded me of when I first saw Indiana Jones as a kid or Stargate as a teenager (a good barometer for you, if you hated Stargate as a teenager or whenever you saw it, you may not like John Carter either). Taylor Kitsch plays his usual gruff, fish out of water self (as seen in Battleship as well), but it works in this movie. The music also elevates the epic adventure and scope of this film. I did not read the books so the first viewing was a little confusing (in terms of terminology, names, etc), but the second time I saw this movie I appreciated and enjoyed it a lot more. It's a shame we won't be seeing any sequels to this movie, because I'm curious to know more about the characters who make up Barsoom (I guess I could read the books). The 3D in this movie is pretty cool too. It's not as mind blowing as some other 3D movies out there (like Transformers 3, Avatar, or Prometheus), but it enhances the alien world of Barsoom nicely, and pulls the viewer into the adventure that much more. For those skeptical, I'd say rent this movie first, but for those who like old-time adventure stories of a fish-out-of-water hero who has to win the hearts of a tough leading lady in order to defeat an all-powerful foe, I'd say definitely give this movie a chance. You'll probably enjoy it much more than the box office returns would have you thought you would.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This series was bad....I read the first and second book and could not imagine spending another $9.99 on the third book.  So, I didn't.  I really tried to get into it and I just could not do it.  Everybody is talking about how great it is and I am not sure why.  If I heard one more \\"Jeez\\" or the \\"ripping of the foil packet\\" I thought I would lose it.  They had sex every five pages and it got to be really annoying and I found myself skipping over them.  I'm not sure if I thought it would be little bit more kinky or more of the dominant/submissive stuff going on but the sex scenes were pretty lame.<br /><br />I wish I wouldn't of wasted $19.89 on the two books I did read.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I saw this movie in IMAX 3D in the theaters when it came out, and it still manages to thrill and excite me every time I see it. I'm surprised it didn't pick up more popularity after it came out. Disney action films are a tough sell nowadays (after the failure of John Carter, which, in my opinion, is a pretty decent film as well). I'm 31, and it's hard to keep my attention with most movies, but something about Tron always manages to captivate and excite me  (especially once the movie moves into the digital world of Tron) . The action, characters, and music are all great and very atmospheric that helps create an artificial but believable world. I hope Disney makes another live-action sequel to this movie (the cartoon on Disney XD this summer, 2012, Tron: Uprising, is a great prequel to the movie, btw). The 3D is also a treat that lacks in many 3D movies. In fact, I bought the non 3D version before I had a 3D TV, but once I got the TV, I had to go back and buy the 3D version of this movie. While the first 30 minutes are not in 3D, once the movie enters the world of Tron, the 3D visuals are cool and effective without being overwhelming. Bottom line: if you like 3D action adventures movies that don't require you to use your brain too much, this one should not disappoint.

0553801473|3.0|The relationship between a writer and a reader is one of trust. When I open up a book, I am trusting in the journey that the writer has planned for me; I am trusting that the destination will be worthwhile, whether it is a destination of deliberately realized anguish, ecstasy, or contentment - or some amalgamation of these. As a reader, I have agreed to an adventure with the writer as my tour guide, body guard and soothsayer. I trust that my writer has SOME FREAKING IDEA WHERE HE IS GOING, which is why I am trusting him to get me there in the first place.<br /><br />After grappling with some 1100+ pages of this latest installment to \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\", I fully want to kick George R.R. Martin in the teeth. He has destroyed our trust relationship between him as a writer and me as a reader to the point that I feel it can never be restored. Really? I sacrificed some 8 hours of my life so that you could take me . . . nowhere? Is it a spoiler to say that this book accomplishes absolutely nothing in terms of plot? Is it even possible to include a spoiler in a review of this book?<br /><br />I don't ask that plotlines be direct or cosmic in scope, I really don't, I love everything Bernard Cornwell has written with a stalker-like intensity and have hung in there with sagas like \\"Poldark\\" and those penned by Wilkie Collins. I read every little elvish poem in JRR Tolkein's masterwork, and have revisited his trilogy at least once every five years for the last 2 decades of my life. I've read Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan and Mercedes Lackey and happily skipped back for more. I don't ask that the plot be perfect or direct, but I do ask, I BEG, I get down on my knees and implore the writer to provide SOME PLOT.<br /><br />Which is essentially what Martin refuses to do. He falls into the trap that, sadly, too many fantasy authors go belly-flopping into, which is that he appears to have fallen in love with the sound of his own voice. He loves every minute detail of the world he's created so darn much that he figures that we'll all be just as riveted with a 40-page council meeting that decides NOTHING as we all would be with a 20-page battle that decided SOMETHING. It's just as painful as if \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" had decided to spend 1100 pages visiting Tom Bombadil, or if the hobbits had spent a couple of volumes hanging out on the side of Mount Doom.<br /><br />I shouldn't have even finished reading the book, since I spent the last 400 pages or so in such a tremendous state of fury and betrayal (at the fact that nothing was happening) that it put me in a bad mood for hours afterward - but I kept expecting that the plot would move. And maybe it did, just a little, right at the end - maybe. Because I don't trust Martin enough anymore to say that his final plot decision(which I won't reveal because it's the closest thing to a spoiler you can include in a review of this book) will actually make an impact on the outcome of the tale. Because I don't know if there will be an outcome to this tale. It is possible that 20 years from now Martin will be releasing the 17th installment to this series, during which Daenarys will spend 45 pages figuring out what to have for breakfast and Jamie Lannister will ride his horse through snowdrifts for 18 chapters.<br /><br />Do I sound bitter? I am. I am bitter that I invested time and hope and energy in an adventure with a tour guide who didn't know where he was going. I would be just as bitter if I hired sherpas to take me up Kilamanjaro and they sort of wandered around the base of the mountain for 3 weeks and then sent me home. Is the Game of Thrones ever going to be decided, or, at the very least, are there even going to be any decisive moves? Or will it be like an incredibly painful, long-winded game of \\"Life\\" where everyone theoretically wins because there is no resolution at all?<br /><br />It's possible that plot is an oppressive modernist construct and I shouldn't be so bound by dominantnotions of literary form. But to that I answer: fantasy IS a freaking literary form. And if I want something post-modern and experimental, I am not going to be looking for it in a genre in which magical beings exist, medieval-style warlords fight for the honor of their houses, their are kinky sex scenes involving horse masters and/or multiple whores, and black-cloaked warriors protect civilization from the horrors of glorified zombies.<br /><br />I think that I am wholly justified in asking for a plot. Except I may have to wait for the HBO series based on this book sequence to produce one, because I'm not sure I'm going to be able to trust this author again.

The casual reader will enjoy this book and perhaps say 'there are some interesting points'.  However, readers that read and ponder the significance of our choices and findings from research presented will get a lot more out of the book.<br /><br />One can see how this information could be valuable in business, personal life, religion etc...  The beauty of this information is that it applies to multiple applications/circumstances.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.  Or better yet - read, ponder, and get a lot more out of it.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br /><br />A pale-skinned \\"god\\" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.<br /><br />So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - \\"choosing to believe\\" - which Shaw echoes.<br /><br />On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us in [[ASIN:0891077669 The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)]] Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.<br /><br />Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced \\"faith\\" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose \\"1492\\" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.<br /><br />Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.<br /><br />Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.<br /><br />In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.<br /><br />There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland \\"Father\\" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)<br /><br />Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that \\"sometimes to create you first have to destroy.\\" Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over (\\"A king dies ...\\") and David seems to want his creators dead (\\"Doesn't everyone ...?\\") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?<br /><br />Or ... are we their creators? Wow.<br /><br />Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoringthe importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.<br /><br />And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)<br /><br />So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his \\"twist\\" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.<br /><br />Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to \\"In the Mountains of Madness\\". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.<br /><br />The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.<br /><br />The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless.

B0058EA3MS|5.0|This was a highly intelligent and beautifully acted film by Mike Leigh. Tom and Gerri played in a calm and understated way by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are simply a lovely and loving couple who are warm and generous to the people they invite into their home. They are a mature and rather well adjusted couple who have apparently settled into a successful marriage and managed to raise a son who shares their characteristics and clearly has benefited from being raised in a loving and stable household.<br /><br />They exhibit true compassion and understanding for those in their circle who are clearly adrift and extremely disappointed in the way their lives have turned out.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who looking for a movie with depth instead of the trash and crap Hollywood seems to turn out.<br /><br />Ellen O'Donnell

B000WYCF6Q|3.0|This is a slick little mirror.  It can attach nearly anywhere on the bicycle and so far hasn't moved during rides.  I use it as a second mirror for when I am riding using the aero bars.  Only 3 stars as it is cheaply made and the distortion is noticeable.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is definitely a little different than the run of the mill sci-fi series. What makes it different is the cowboy flair they give to it. You wouldn't think that mixing a cowboy style with sci-fi would work, but in this case it does.<br /><br />My favorite character is the lead, Malcom. He's more or less a retired cavalry officer who has taken up a new line of work captaining a ship called Firefly. The character has a ton of charisma. He's not at all one of those wimpy sci-fi characters that's always worried about intergalactic peace or the prime directive. He tends to shoot first an ask questions later.<br /><br />The other characters are interesting too. Malcolm's almost love interest is a high end call girl, who takes occasional jobs as they stop off at various places along the way. And then there is the rather quirky pilot who provides some good moments of comic relief. Toss in a couple of others, and the occasional visitor and it's a pretty interesting crew.<br /><br />The technical name for this type of genre is a \\"space opera\\". What that means is that the episodes often showcase different aspects of the various characters lives to the backdrop of some kind of drama. Series like Star Trek, Farscape, etc., fall into that same category and if you liked them, you'll likely enjoy Firefly.<br /><br />A great many people wonder why the series ended. And considering what the did with the two season's, tend to agree. Some episodes towards the end did loose their edge, but I didn't think they were out of gas. If the series had any weakness it was probably that they didn't develop aliens that were terribly interesting. The ultra villains, the Reavers, were kind of a joke. However, my guess is that Joss just got bored with it and moved on to some other project.<br /><br />Short as it was, I'd recommend it. It's solid as Sci-fi series go.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|downloaded hoping it was sort of like tiny villiage where I could have fun building it.  but I not only got big time annoyed becacause every two minutes it is asking u to buy or build something but the worst thing was I spent 10. minutes trying to get out of it.
B007MDB71O|3.0|As some have remarked, John Carter isn't as bad as the critics claim. I can't say it's the best sci-fi I've ever seen but it is memorable.<br /><br />The basic story, without spoilers, is about a postwar Confederate soldier, named John Carter, who ends up on Mars by accident. He soon finds himself in the middle of a new civil war between the three peoples who inhabit the planet. For his part, John must decide what his place is in this new world.<br /><br />The best part of the film are the visual effects. They've done a really good job of world building the cinematography is high quality. They went for a steampunk look and feel (high tech/low tech) and for the most part it works. Also, the action wasn't overblown as is the case in a lot of the current movies.<br /><br />Disney did a good job of creating likeable characters and there are plenty of comical moments along the way. For the most part the storyline keeps you interested and in that sense the movie succeeds.<br /><br />So where does John Carter go wrong--and why do I only give it three stars? Two reasons, both of which are tied to the screenplay itself. The scenes can be very choppy at times. It really feels like the problem may be do to a screenplay that was rewritten one too many times leaving the story disjointed.<br /><br />Another big problem for me was all the characters and scenes that too closely resembled other movies--I kept getting flashes of Jar Jar Binks, Jabba the Hut and that blue-man scene from Braveheart. It was very distracting because it was so hard not to notice.<br /><br />Even so, it's still worth watching. Yes, it can be corny and a little recycled at times but its still fun. It was certainly worth the dollar blueray rental. If you like sci-fi and don't have super-high expectations, you'll probably enjoy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. it passes the time when I need it but it also is a lot of fun.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I actually got so frustrated w/the game I didn't play it for about three weeks.  Had to refer to the hint guide almost all the time & I like to play a game that I don't have to take the hint all of the time.  If you forgot to pick up something while you were in one season then you had to back track to that season to retrieve it.  I did finally finish it...it took me so long I guess it was worth the $1.99.  Graphics are good.

B005IQZB14|5.0|If there is a word that bugs me, it is the word \\"empowered\\" but empowered and inspired are words that aren't adequate enough to describe how I felt after reading \\"Wild.\\"  It is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Cheryl Strayed is a natural storyteller and I felt I was right there with her on the Pacific Crest Trail, experiencing her hardships and the triumphs albeit from the comfort of my sofa.  Anyone who is at a crossroads in their life can relate to the urge to do SOMETHING that will get them back on a path to finding themselves.  Strayed happened to choose an actual path to walk on to finding what she needed.

B0001Z37HM|3.0|Kind of...Conan was meant to be the next James Bond character having a series of adventures, mining the Robert E. Howard's books till people got sick of the movies.  At least, that was what I heard.  Instead we get Red Sonja, starring Brigitte Nielsen, Arnold Schwarzenegger (whose name is always first in the credits even on the DVD cover), and Sandahl Bergman who makes for a interesting if somewhat unrealistic Evil Queen.  Frankly, Paul Smith, Ernie Reyes, JR. and Ronald Lacey have more interesting characters even if their parts are small.<br />Your basic sword-and-sorcery story in which Red Sonja must fight Evil blah, blah, blah.  The creators toss in a few scenes of humor that sometimes fall flat, romance that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere, and a glowing orb which is so powerful...well, I don't know what it does but it seems powerful.<br />Still...you can't help but enjoy it.  The action scenes, the interaction between the more interesting secondary characters, and the music makes it a good pop-corn film.  Get it used or out of the library
0984999302|5.0|There are brilliant insights throughout. I have helped, advised and invested in hundreds of startups for over 30 years, and Steve Blank put that vast experience in perspective and explained to me just what it is I had 'actually' been doing!! The book is truly a game changer.
0984725113|5.0|Concise and clearly written, this book describes the challenges we face, lays out the history of how we have gotten to where we are, and presents well thought out suggestions to rectify some systemic problems that will otherwise cripple our future.<br /><br />This is a very quick and worthwhile read. Especially timely as the US must make some tough choices about its future during this Presidential election.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a great production.  Being a Conan Doyle fan (and not too fond of the \\"new\\" Sherlock stories by various authors, including his son), I loved the way they brought Sherlock to the modern age.  Although the stories differ from the original, Sherlock and Watson have the same characteristics and they act as you sould expect from Conan Doyle's characters.<br /><br />Great show.  NJow I'm just waiting for season 3 :D
B003Y5H574|1.0|This was on HBO, rated three stars, so I thought I'd watch. Who ranks these? Where do I start?<br /><br />First the dialog. Completely unbelievable. None of it sounded real. Zero. I'm also getting really tired of seeing middle-school aged children be the wise soothsayers, making all the adults nod sagely. I was creeped out by the borderline unnerving stalking of the son character of the babysitter, and the similarly creepy (and completely unbelievable) stalking her character did of the father. The single-mindedness the son had about the babysitter was entirely ridiculous. Doesn't the kid own an X-box?? Thirteen year old boys have the attention spans of gnats, and I would be a little weirded out if I was an adult around a kid who was that obsessed. The youngest daughter was a paper-thin throwaway character, mindlessly flitting around the movie, dancing like an autistic mental patient in her dad's new apartment, after her parent's marital separation. Oh, how funny! I'm surprised they didn't put her in an omnipresent tutu to really hammer home just how unaffected and breezy she is about--let me repeat it--her parent's marital separation. Was anyone else skeeved out seeing Steve Carell trying to get his groove on at a lounge catering to twenty-somethings, aka his daughter's age? Maybe this is commonplace in LA, but in the rest of the country, there's something really gross about it as well as tired. Barring the baffling attraction the rest of the country has for Ryan Gosling, as well as the boring one-note Emma Stone (who basically plays the same character over and over and over and over), I guess no other women who frequent the only bar apparently in town had any personality whatsoever. Kevin Bacon was supposed to be a reviled character, but I was like \\"thank God, someone interesting\\" every time he came onscreen.<br /><br />And then they had to hit us with the cheesiest technique ever, one I refer to as a film's \\"Oh Captain my Captain\\" moment--at a middle school graduation no less. We're supposed to believe that an audience there to see their own child graduate is going to be in thrall of a rambling speech about love, clapping along? In reality, everyone would be shifting in their seats uncomfortably, hissing that maybe you should shut up so we can get on with it, which is exactly how I felt about 100% of this lame hackneyed piece of a movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent read.  I did not see the movie.  The author is very good at creating a believable image of a world in ruins and governed in an incredibly cruel and inhuman fashion.  The heroine's ability to deal with the travails of life in this society gives one hope for the human spirit.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I know the title of my review is bad but that is exactly what I thought of as I read this book. Besides the writing being on an elementary school level, the idea is not realistic or logical unless the book's target audience is 50+. The main character is 20 something but doesn't know how to use a computer (seriously?) and somehow graduates from university in the 21st century. Then the supposed BDSM always turns into vanilla sex. So this story is about someone who's a virgin (yes in their 20s in the 21st century) exploring her sexuality. I can't speak for anyone else but the descriptions are so plain jane of what happens, I can't see how this is risque at all. He kisses her in the elevator - OMG! He gets fellatio - that's so utterly insane. She uses his toothbrush - TWICE! Noted in my sarcasm is my utter disbelief of how bad the story of this book is. If it helps some people open up - good for you.  I would suggest watching Bravo on a Friday at midnight would be more educational and better in all intended aspects. On the contrary for me, the story and character is so pathetic that I'm so turned off I'm embracing abstinence.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I reccommend this for long spells of boredom or road trips. This game is very fun and it keeps you busy and kills time.
0670022411|5.0|Short review. Whats needs to be said about this book has already been said on here.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pacing of this story. Right from the start, the pacing is great. Because how you tell a story matters just as much as what the story is about.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Wonderful movie, can't beat a product like this as it gave me 5 hours peace and quiet whilst the boss watched it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is a well done movie with excellent actors, and those that are not even well known. The movie has excellent plots that come together to show the differences in how people choose to live the lives. No foul language was necessary! This movie touched so many different emotions, and brings out the need for the values that our country has lost so much of, and I believe that is why our country suffers the way it does today. There's so much dishonesty! There are those who think that having a relationship with God isn't necessary, an excuse for a crutch, etc. That's because they have never experienced the profound affect that a relationship with Christ can bring to their lives, and the rewarding life changes that occur. This is NOT a preachy movie yet it shows the differences in the lives of those who have a lack of values to live by, and those who have chosen to incorporate Godly love, ethics, and virtues in their lives. It is a strong faith-based movie and I challenge everyone to see it. Be Courageous!

0143034901|5.0|It doesn't happen very often, but every once in a while, I find myself in a dusty corner of a used book store with a book in my hand that makes me feel like I've discovered something. I know that a book with \\"The New York Times Bestseller\\" printed on top of \\"One gorgeous read--Stephen King\\" isn't exactly my discovery alone, but when I found The Shadow of the Wind, I still had that little thrill of finding something special that will always feel a little more 'mine' than other books.<br /><br />Zafon had me from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books that reminded me of my beloved and now closed Acres of Books in Long Beach, CA. I fell in love with Daniel, the main character, but his friend Fermin has become one of my favorite literary characters ever. The Shadow of the Wind is a story within a story, full of Gothic creepiness, with Barcelona like a character itself. There are decrepit mansions, old women in asylums, obsessive love, and lots and lots of books. The Shadow of the Wind is, at its heart, a love story for books.<br /><br />There were things that should have turned me off: it's a long read that sometimes bogged down in its own exuberant descriptions, sometimes it seems like Fafon had a list of literary tricks that he ticked off as he made his way through the book (Bad men that look like spiders? Check. Beautiful women that inspire good men to do bad things? Check. A single letter that ties up every lose end of the mystery at the end of the book? Check.) Over all, though, I was so drawn in by the story, and by falling in love with Barcelona and the characters, that I forgave every flaw.<br /><br />What I loved: I loved the concept of a book all about the love of books. I loved the Gothic-ness of this story, and how I finished it feeling like I'd been to Barcelona. I loved Daniel and his father and Julian, and most of all I loved Fermin. I loved the beautiful language. I loved the twist at the end, even if it was delivered too neatly.<br /><br />What I didn't love: Like I said, the end of the book was too wrapped up with a  bow. The dual story line between Daniel and Julian was also a little too exact. I had to suspend my disbelief quite a lot at some points. That being said, I was able to do it without too much trouble.<br /><br />Grade: I went back and forth, but ended up giving this one a B+. It's a beautiful book, with a few flaws that are forgivable.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />I'm one-half of the Story Carnivores book blog!Like I said, the end of the book was too wrapped up with a  bow.

0984999302|5.0|Having been through the start up process myself and been investing in startups for 13 years, I can tell you, \\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" is absolutely a must read for anyone even contemplating doing a startup.  Before you even find a cofounder, I would skim this book.  Keep it close and re-read in depth as you get closer to starting the company.  Not only will it save you countless hours, headaches and thousands of dollars - it just might make the difference between success and failure.  Doing a startup is a ton of work and \\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" will help you focus your energy, time and resources.

B002WY65UQ|4.0|St. Trinian's (2007) is an update of the old Belles of St. Trinian's films based on the cartoons of Ronald Searle.  Searle started drawing St. Trinian's girls after meeting a friend's sister and wondering what sort of school would produce her. The girls of St. Trinian's are the worst sort of troublemakers: the smart, inventive, motivated ones.<br /><br />When Annabelle Fritton (Talulah Riley) is dropped off at St. Trinian's, she doesn't fit in.  Her aunt (Rupert Everett) might be the headmaster, but Annabelle is too uptight and law abiding to immediately bond with the girls.  But just as she begins to find a place for herself, the girls discover the new Minister of Education (Colin Firth) wants to shut the school down.  The only thing to do is cheat to win University Quiz and pull off an art heist.<br /><br />This British cult comedy is absolutely hilarious.  I saw it with my dad and we were both cracking up.  I do recommend buying the DVD because the deleted scenes are pretty funny.  I see why some of them aren't in the final cut, but others I would've kept in the film.  I can honestly say that St. Trinian's is the only movie I've seen that made me laugh at someone kicking a dog.<br /><br />The cast is essential to selling the black comedy.  Head Girl Kelly Jones was Gemma Arterton's (Quantum of Solace) breakout role.  Juno Temple is a rising indie star.  Jodie Whittaker (Attack the Block) plays an utterly incompetent school secretary.  Rupert Everett is unrecognizable as both Camilla and Carnaby Fritton.  (St. Trinian's does its part to keep the British drag tradition alive.)  Lena Headley (Game of Thrones, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) is also unrecognizable as a mild-mannered teacher until she shows her St. Trinian's mettle during the climax.<br /><br />Colin Firth, usually the dashing hero, does quite well as the hapless villain.  Plus, his presence allows for a number of Pride & Prejudice jokes.  (Three of the actresses have also appeared in P&P adaptations.)  But his star power never outshines the large female cast, which is only fitting.  Whenever they're onscreen, the girls of St. Trinian's steal the show.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a comedy, I recommend picking up a copy of St. Trinian's.  Now if only I could find the sequel for less than $25.<br /><br />Another thing to recommend it?  The terrific pop soundtrack, which includes the theme \\"Defenders of Anarchy\\" by Girls Aloud.ptations.)  But his star power never outshines the large female cast, which is only fitting.

I did, however, predict the ending fairly early. Not that it ruined the read, but it is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.

B000003RCY|5.0|We had already owned a couple of their newer albums for awhile before taking our son to his first concert, Rammstein 2012, at the tender age of 15, and after doing so (FANTASTIC live show btw!) we realized that this band needed full representation in our household!<br /><br />I'm usually skeptical when it comes down to \\"first studio release\\" albums but am glad that this one, purchased last, gave us the perspective of their more \\"polished\\" work first.  Herzeleid is an excellent example of a band that \\"has it right\\", right from the start.  All the signature Rammstein sounds are there and not as unpolished as one might think!  From Til's emphatic singing style, well forward drums, industrial keyboard riffs and electric guitar and bass licks that hit like the blast wave from an atomic bomb, everything that makes Rammstein Rammstein is fully developed in this first album...  Songs like \\"Der Meister\\" and \\"Heirate Mich\\" could easily fit right at home on any of their later albums.  Even \\"Seemann\\" already defined the acoustic guitar led ballads that some true Rammstein fans have come to love.<br /><br />For a new Rammstein fan Herzeleid will not disappoint...  This IS Rammstein!  For the unfinished collector this album is a *must have*.

B004YXE438|5.0|I played this puzzle app on the Kindle Fire demo model in my local Target.  I came home and downloaded a couple of free puzzle apps to my own Kindle Fire, but I wasn't impressed so I paid real money for Spectrum Puzzles and I was not disappointed.  The photos are beautiful and there are different levels and sizes to suit my mood--easy, mindless passing of time or difficult, focused brain workout.  I am not a big jigsaw puzzle person so I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this app for that quick minute on the demo model at the store.  This is definitely worth the buck-fifty!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I saw my sister playing this and I looked it up on my Kindle Fire and ive been addicted to it for like 4 or 5 months
030758836X|5.0|This was a great book.  The characters and story were interesting and different.  I was thrown off halfway through and at that point could not put it down until I was finished!  Read in a day and a half.  A must read for the summer!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolutely horribly written book.  If there was such a category as \\"teen porn\\" it would be the perfect fit due to all the tweenybopper language used and the blushing. A bazzilion, \\"Jeez!\\", \\"Oh MY!!\\", turning crimson, blushing, and the all time dumbest ever...\\"he touched me 'DOWN THERE'....  OMG!!  At that point, I knew I could not go on.  So stupid.  I couldn't get beyond 150 pages and gave up.  I wanted to throw the book against the wall...it was THAT bad.  This book will be enjoyed by teenagers and women who have never experienced great sex or any sex at all.  Save yourselves the trouble and just go have some good sex.  I felt that I was overdoing it by giving it one star, but wasn't sure there was a 0 star category and was afraid my review wouldn't be posted if I didn't check one star at least.  The name of the books should be Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest.  Truly.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A good read that leaves you wanting more.  I read it for my book club and everyone seemed to enjoy it.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|A great running book inspires both the newbie and the veteran to stretch their legs and feel the wind in their hair by doing one of the most basic movements of the human species. Christopher McDougall takes us through the fascinating history of running, and posits that biomechanically, running long (as opposed to running fast) is our Homo sapial birthright. It's a compelling argument, to be sure, and much evidence is offered to support this claim. However, the other claim the book makes, which is that anyone can run without difficulty given they run with the right form, is a bit more problematic. I think this argument is slightly backwards. It might be more accurate to say that, in the days where running was crucial to survival, those who couldn't do it well (due to biomechanical mutations or developmental issues, say) were culled from the species by predators or what have you, and the only ones left standing were those who were capable of running well. Nowadays, since most people at least in the more affluent countries barely need to walk five steps to survive, biomechanical defects can accumulate in the population, such that indeed there are those whose bodies truly are no good at running NOW. Anyone with a general understanding of population genetics can readily envision this. Basically, the main thrust of the story--we evolved to run--is probably true, but that all of us nowadays can still do it well is probably not true, for the reasons I stated. Nevertheless that doesn't take away from the fact that this book is a thrill to read, especially the story of the Tarahumara Indians, and good old Caballo Blanco, RIP.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|Jane's Addiction - The Great Escape Artist (2012)<br /><br />Let's stop living in the past shall we? The salad days of Jane's Addiction are long gone. Why crap on a great band that doesn't make albums like they did 20 freakin years ago!? I suspect that most of the people giving THE GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST a low rating haven't really taken the time to give it a good listen and let it exist on its own terms. If you've rejected this album out of hand I implore you to give it another listen with fresh ears and an open mind. THE GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST is a killer album in its own right. Sure, it doesn't have the same frenetic energy of RITUAL DE LO HABITUAL. Instead, TGEA brings its own kind of power. This music is insular and thick with murky, sinister atmospheres. The songs themselves are fully realized and truly excellent. Perry Farrell's voice is in fine form. If anything, the quality of his voice is less grating yet there's still an edginess to his delivery. He's as good a singer today as he ever was. Dave Navarro's guitar sounds awesome although he doesn't do any overt showboating. Instead, his playing is always in service to the song.<br /><br />The influence of collaborator Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio (I'm a fan) is palpable in the exquisite washes of sound and tastefully subtle electronic touches. Dave also plays bass guitar on about half the songs on the album with Chris Cheney taking the other half, both contributing a supple muscle and a solid anchor with superb bassage. And Dave Navarro's on bass somewhere in there too. Who plays what I couldn't say....<br /><br />\\"Underground\\" - \\"I try to find some love from up high/ there just ain't enough to go around\\" ...I agree with Perry - we're all hustlers in one way or another. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"End To The Lies\\" - A whirlwind of doom and a sharp kiss-off to a person who turned out to be a big waste of time. *****<br /><br />\\"Curiosity Kills\\" -  I like this track a lot even though it's probably my least fav on the album, and that's saying something because it's really good. ****<br /><br />\\"The Irresistible Force (Met The Immovable Object)\\" - To me this great song isn't great enough to merit its current Amazon status as \\"The only worthwhile GEA cut.\\" The reason I think it got this reputation is because it was the best early download and people gave it a chance to sink in. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"I'll Hit You Back\\" -  is a great track with great lyrics. I think people complaining about Perry's lyrics simply haven't given them enough thought. One thing fans do and I've done it before myself is overload on the band's previously released music right before they get their hands on a new album. Mistake! *****<br /><br />\\"Twisted Tales\\" - is sexy, one of the best songs on the album. The chorus has a disco vibe. The lyrics? Some of the best. *****+<br /><br />\\"Ultimate Reason\\" - The first of three songs written in collaboration with former Velvet Revolver/ Guns and Roses alum Duff McKagen. This is a thundering song that also bubbles along dreamily in places. It suffers a bit from coming after a better song with a similar theme, but this is good stuff. ****<br /><br />\\"Splash A Little Water On It\\" - This one has such a quiet intensity; it just moves me. Most likely about a death by overdose, although that's subject to interpretation (no doubt one of the main things I love about music). To me it sounds like he wakes up to find his girlfriend has overdosed and he's in denial about it... *****+<br /><br />\\"Broken People\\" -  An interesting song that continually morphs and evolves throughout its entire duration, building in intensity. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Words Right Out Of My Mouth\\" - Janes thrash this one out quite nicely, making for a surprising climax that swoops in fast and hard out of left field. Sweet! *****<br /><br />highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S. - I feel the pain --Eric Avery played a crucial role in Jane's first incarnation. I would love for them to get together and make more incredible music. In the meantime, I'll be getting off on THE GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST.ible music. In the meantime, I'll be getting off on THE GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST.
0780747550|3.0|Frank McCourt's celebrated book tracks the story of young Frank from the dregs of New York to Limerick, Ireland, and back, and paints a depressing landscape of poverty and human weakness, with glimmers of hope among the ruins.<br /><br />As this book has been touted highly, I expected much more than I got: a semi-autobiographical version of Dickensian squalor with a streak of Joyce, it was a tale that I feel has been told before. I was expecting, I suppose, some exquisite or revolutionary prose, or some original insight into human nature. At the very least, I thought perhaps there would be a unique plot twist to account for this book's popularity, but it's likely that what drove sales was in part the promise of \\"poverty porn.\\" There are lovely moments, though, honest moments that shine through: for example, Frank's feelings about the girls he interacted with toward the end felt genuine to me, and in that way packed an emotional punch. There are also moments where the narration is hysterically funny. It's not a bad book by any means: it just does not live up to its hype.

0060853972|5.0|\\"Good Omens\\" is a fun way of looking at the coming of Armageddon.  The story line is mostly centered on Agnes Nutter's (a witch burned at the stake) prophecies.  Pratchett and Gaiman hook you in by introducing you to the angle and demon that drive the story.  There is a lot of light humor that seriously makes you wonder whether true evil or true goodness exist.  This wonderfully orchestrated story takes you on an adventure through each character's development towards Armageddon, leaving you to wonder if absolute good and evil actually exists.<br />Crowley (the demon) and Aziraphale (the angel) are charged with the upbringing of the Anti-Christ in forming his childhood into becoming either good or evil and starting Armageddon.  They decide that they do not want the end of times to come.  They have come to like their lives amongst humans.  When they find out that the child they have been watching is not the Anti-Christ, they go on an adventure to find the child.  Pratchett and Gaiman switch over to a different place where a child having a very normal upbringing is having an extraordinary childhood.  A witch hunter is on the move to the same location, investigating abnormal events occurring in the area.  When you finally meet the Anti-Christ, it's hard to dislike him.  This child has a very vivid imagination and it is wonderful to see the silliness he thinks of come to life.<br />The way Pratchett and Gaiman hook you into this story is awesome!  They highlight certain information and allow the reader the option of digging deeper into the story.  They introduce each of the main characters with a bit of background to allow for the story to flow easier.  They give you a wonderful insight to each character that allows you to make that personal connection.  Who knew demons had feelings?  Pratchett and Gaiman go through Adam's life (the \\"spawn of Satan\\") from the time he is born then fast forwards to two days before Agnes Nutter predicted Armageddon would come.  They give you a good insite of how everyone is racing time trying to keep this event from happening.  Everyone except the other forces like God, the other demons, and the four horsemen...which make a grand entrance that will make you chuckle.<br />Overall, this book caught my attention.  It is hard for me to find books that can do that from the beginning and keep me captivated throughout the whole story.  It was a very enjoyable book to read.  Every time I read it, I find something new that gives me that \\"Ah-ha\\" moment.  You don't really need to have a religious background to understand the story, but it might make you curious as to where some of the characters got their names.  I actually ended up going on Google and researching some of the demon and angel names to see how much the writers kept some truth in their wonderful story lines.  It was rather nice to see how even a demon could change an cheer on humanity.

B007KLY8FA|3.0|Ahmad Jamal's early work remains quite remarkable after all these years, and this set has a lot of great music for the money.  However, the sound quality is not the best.  The first album \\"Count Em 88\\" is actually from a scratchy LP.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Ahmad Jamal since the 60s, and have collected much of what is out there on CD or LP.  I am somewhat suprised at how the sound quality varies.  The early Pershing LPs on Argo, for example, sound like they were recorded yesterday--clear and clean, full bass.  Over the years they were re-issued and re-re issued on by Chess, and the quality of the masters and the pressings themselves deteriorated.  I believe some CD's were tken from these inferior LP masters rather than going back to the source.<br /><br />There is a very good and more expensive re-issue set \\"The Complete Ahmad Jamal Trio Argo Sessions 1956-52\\" on Mosaic, which mostly has superior sound, although the \\"Spotlite Club\\" and \\"Alhambra\\" recordings sound better on the Gambit and Japanese Argo/Cadet mini-lp reissue, respectively.

I am able to receive motion detection, temperature drops or rises, humidity detection and sound detection alerts on my iPhone and iPad making this an invaluable tool for monitoring my home while I'm away.

0345803485|3.0|Not going to lie, I liked the simple writing. I like to keep it simple. One thing about it that surprised me was the typos; noticeable typos that ruined the moment for me throughout the book.  Another thing that bothered me was the repetitiveness. The \\"Oh my...,\\" the lip biting and the blushing got to be pretty painful by the end of the book. The dialogue confused me on and off throughout the book as well. Sometimes I had to go back and read the conversation over again because I got confused on who was saying what.<br /><br />I found Christian to be a very interesting character. I suppose it was because I thought his character development was taken slowly (in my opinion). There are things that bothered me about him though. He's a 28 year old self-made billionaire. That kind of made me roll my eyes but even Anastasia was like \\"Uh, how is that even possible?\\" which made it a little more tolerable because that unrealistic trait was called out. I suppose it COULD be possible though. There a so many people on this earth that it would dumb of me to think that not one person has that kind of intelligence and ambition to become so successful.  On top of his income, he's a genius, and has various talents such as the ability to play the piano perfectly, speak fluent French and fly helicopters/gliders. Again, all these talents are possible for a human being, but how does a person learn all that and become the CEO of a very successful company and the tender age of 28?<br /><br />I really did like Anastasia for a good majority of the book, but towards the end she began to irritate me. One thing I appreciated about her was that she never acted like a love-sick teenager towards Christian. She was drawn to him because he was extremely interesting and mysterious.  She turned down his invitation to be given an exclusive tour by this gorgeous man of his company building, and left his building with the intention of never seeing him again--and that was okay with her. A lot of people complained about how all she talked about was how \\"hot\\" he was. I personally didn't think it was overdone. If Christian is really as hot as he's made out to be, I would think about it a lot too. It's not like she spews out those words to anyone but herself. I also liked how she called out that he really *was* too good to be true. As their relationship developed, I grew to dislike her more. She became needier, and was always trying to pry information out of Christian.<br /><br />She also became extremely jealous over the stupidest things. If a female so much as looked at Christian, she would immediately think \\"WAS THAT ONE OF HIS SUBS!? DOES HE LOVE HER!?\\" Anastasia's hate of the relationship Christian had with Mrs. Robinson made it hard for me to really judge her for it until Christian established time and time again that Mrs. Robinson actually HELPED him. She was jealous of something that happened 7-10 years ago. Get over yourself, Ana. It's no secret that Christian is extremely jealous himself, but Ana would have the nerve to comment that he was a stalker, or that he was so jealous, when she was just as bad and was far more irritating about it. Another thing that bothered me about her was how naive and stupid she came across to be. She knew what made Christian mad and yet she deliberately would do it and have the gull to be like \\"Oh no! Christian is mad at me and is going to punish me! I hate being punished more than anything!\\" Throughout the book she would do things over and over that she knew Christian wouldn't approve of, and every time Christian called her out on it, she would do it again on the next page like she was some disabled puppy that was impossible to potty train.<br /><br />I've tried to read steamy romance novels before, but never finished them because the sex was so cheesy and overdone. This book, however, had pretty well written sex scenes. They had just the right amount imagine it. People complained about how Anastasia would orgasm easily, but I don't think that's anything to complain about. I've heard of women having like five orgasms during sex. Plus Christian is super sexy--I'd probably do the same thing if I was her. I liked the BDSM in the book. I'm *somewhat* familiar with that lifestyle though I could never argue with someone who really is a dom/sub as far as how realistic it is.<br /><br />I probably won't finish the series, but I'm glad I gave it a shot.'t think that's anything to complain about.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a dissapointment!  I, as most of us had, heard great reviews about this book.  However, I couldn't make it past the first 3 chapters.  It seems to have been written by a teenager.  It is the adult porn replica of a cheap harliquin romance, without the romance.  The sex scenes aren't even that good, and so unrealistic.  We wander why the girls and woman in todays world feel that they must be beautiful and young to have a good life.  Well, let's see, the subject of this book is extraordinarily beautiful, is 21, a virgin who has never been kissed or even masturbated, and is going into a domineering relationship to be a submissive slave to a guy who makes her legally sign her rights away and has a room full of sex toys like whips and handcuffs.  Really - this is sexually arousing?  Uggg - how about meeting someone who is very attractive and can turn you on with his mouth, lips and hands and non-dangerous sex toys, and who appreciates and loves you.  Thats my life now - maybe that's why I find this book incredibly rediculous and immature.  Thanks for letting me vent and I wish I could get a refund.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|I just picked this up over this past weekend and listened to it about 3 times and just kept waiting for it to get not just better but just plain good.I guess I am one of those who when listening to Yes want and need to hear Jon Anderson.I am a fan of the \\"Classic lineup\\" give me Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman[Rick] Howe and Squire.<br />The music to me was disjointed and reminded me of Pink Floyd's album The Division Bell,trying very hard to sound as if a key member of the group were there but alas not.<br />I can't faulf the new vocalist and if he ever gets a band of his own I'll give it a good listen  Until then could someone please call Jon and make nice{he'll bring along Rick Their album together is really good]

B006TZBGBW|4.0|If you're someone like me who never had the complete Judas Priest collection, this is the product to get! I have several Priest CDs already, including the Metalogy box set. I had several cassettes back in the day, but those are all long gone now. This box set now truly completes my Priest collection. It's a shame that the band decided to omit the Ripper Owens era (Jugulator, Demolition, '98 Live Meltdown, and Live in London). That's why I'm only giving this box set 4 stars instead of 5. Seems like they're trying to erase that part of their history. If that's the case, why not omit all CDs featuring former drummer Dave Holland, who was convicted for statutory rape on a minor back in 2004? If you're a recent Priest fan or someone who just discovered the band recently, this is perhaps the best product you can buy. Truly worth it!
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Strange, bizarre, inexpicable waste of time.  Doesn't anyone read scripts anymore?  Could have been great but it totally missed the mark.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have read the entire trilogy and find this one to be my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong...I enjoyed the generous kinky parts!  But, I have to say that James' writing sometimes interfered with my ability to enjoy it fully.  I found myself sighing each time I saw her use the word \\"mutter,\\" \\"muttered,\\" or \\"muttering.\\"  Everyone mutters in this story.  I would find a form of that word, sometimes several times, on each page.  She overused several words, but that was the worst offender, in my opinion.<br /><br />That being said, I did buy the second in the trilogy and kept reading.  I'm glad I did!

It could be Bryson with a twist, I thought. Then I heard about Cheryl Strayed's Wild and thought someone had beat me to it. But reading Wild, I realize that this was no middle-aged female version of Bryson's tale. Not at all. It's instead a raw, well-paced journey about a troubled young woman, her painful weeks on the PCT, and the tumultuous life that led up to her taking that first bold step as a solo female hiker.<br /><br />Following the cancer death of the author's mother at age 45, Strayed sinks deeper and deeper into a series of self-destructive behaviors. This tendency to self inflict wounds leads her to destroy a loving marriage and then change her name post-divorce to \\"Strayed,\\" which she wears like a badge--her scarlet letter--for all the world to see. The wreckless acts she had folded into her life explains Strayed's mindset when she pulls on her boots for the first time, making you wonder whether the story will end in the author's hoped-for catharsis or will it be the ultimate bad decision of Strayed's life.<br /><br />Wild is not the same old hiking tale others have written--nor is it one I would tell. It stands alone as a fresh, well-written chronicle of a woman's journey, by foot and with heart, along the PCT.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|This is a fascinating insight into that part of a policeman's work about which we know comparatively little, namely how to 'read' someone's state of mind from their body language. This former FBI agent mixes sound scholarship and considerable personal experience as an investigator in a book that is not only of general interest but an essential 'must' for any crime writer.

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Brandon Sanderson IS THE next author to read on the maturity steps of Fantasy reading.<br /><br />Excellent book , from a - z<br /><br />Actually, Ill be bold and say that this is one series that I would rate among the top 5 of fantasy!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|I love this DVD, absolutely great.<br />Four singers are excellent, especially Anna Netrebko. Her voice is powerful and her performance is vibrant. Elina Garanca is also great. Their debut is rally charming.<br />A little disappoint at men, but still good.
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|Always has a different sound but still Alan Parson.  LOTS of extra music, ( not on the vinyl ) A good addition to a collection.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Priest are easily amoung the greatest bands ever formed and this album is a testament to that.  The vocals are epic, the guitar riffs are epic. the song structure and musicianship is outstanding, the likes of which we don't see anymore.  Great album, well worth the money.
B00846TTDG|2.0|This movie is pretty bad, slapped together generic story and complete lack of acting ability across the board. How does that make a 5 star movie? That's easy, take advantage of peoples patriotism and the idea that disliking a moving that is \\"celebrating our men in uniform\\" is not an option unless you are a communist.<br /><br />If you really like listening to semi real sounding military jargon delivered via terrible acting, this movie is for you. If you can ignore all the normal requirements of a \\"good\\" movie and simply focus on military dudes shooting at stuff sometimes, this movie is for you. If you are looking for an entertaining, well crafted, thought inspiring film, skip this one.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest defends the faith of heavy metal.  Another of Priests greatest albums.  The hits include Jawbreaker, Defenders of the faith, the Sentinal, wah hell all the songs are excellent.  This is Judas Priest style heavy metal at it's best.  The price alone is worth the Live at Long Beach Arena, California 5th May 1984 2 disc set which is included.  I spent years trying to find this live show and only found select pieces from it as bonus tracks on other Priest remasters but here it is finally.  This is one of the finest live albums ever made and could have been a set all by itself, but this Defenders set is amazing.  Second to none live or otherwise the PRIEST IS BACK!!! \m/\m/
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun little game.  like my title says, its a good way to pass the time.  highly recommended and fun game.
B00005K9LN|5.0|This was the album that solidified Judas Priest as the heavy metal gods.  Every song is awesome, the riffs are pure heavy metal greatness, the vocals are excellent, and as a whole or by song this album is one of the best albums ever made. \m/\m/ HAIL THE PRIEST!
0099579936|5.0|Okay, honestly so what if this book drops the f-bomb, and the whole \\"mommy porn\\" hype is so lame .... There's no scene in this book that you couldn't watch on HBO at night. With that being said, this whole series is excellent. It has such a great story line and each book will leave you rushing around to get the next! I will admit some of the dialogue is a bit repetitive but you will be so consumed by the thoughts of \\"OMG whats gonna happen next\\" that you most likely will not even mind the repetitiveness. I recommend this book to everyone, who loves a good book.<br /><br />Laters baby &lt;3
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this one. the graphics remind me of Tomb Raider. It is very challenging and you need to be very quick.<br />I would recomend it.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Such a cool love story. Great poetry. Love the concept of the \\"Slam\\". This story deals with death and loss in a refreshing, realistic manner. The characters are great and the humor is there. Sometimes you need a refreshing sense of humor when dealing with such tragic events. It's uplifting not depressing. Check it out.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Ill be honest. At first I want so sure about this book but I had read a review about it in people magazine and it was on the kindle daily deal for 2.99. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. A Discovery of Witches is not your typical paranormal book. Sure there's a bit of romance (The romance is there but it doesnt over power the rest of the book) but its much more of a mystery novel. By the end you can not wait to read the next book
B0086700CM|5.0|I really recommend this game its fun and exciting to play even my mom plays it with me on my kindle
B005SODYGA|3.0|I love Rammstein. I have seen them 5 times all over the world and recently here in Atlanta. This album's remix is techno without any debate. Sad that there is only 1 new song.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Magic Academy is a fun little search and find.  It stands out because of the art as well as the variety of search and find.  The story is a little hookie and a little too much like a harry potter novel-but it is engaging enough.  Having a fun time and satisfied with purchase.
0345803485|5.0|Heard so much about this and decided to read it out of curiousity. Love the story! Easy reading and looking forward to reading the next two.
0425263908|3.0|I loved the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy.  Fifty Shades this ain't!  Doesn't even approach the consuming angst. of FSOG...at least not for me.  But I wonder if Ms. Day meant this book to be similar to FSOG with her plot?  Yes, there are many similarities.  Coincidence?  I dunno..possibly, or it could possibly be two great Authors that think alike.  Who knows?<br /><br />I absolutely adored Gideon Cross' character.  Just frikkin' hawt...  I loved his controlling, possessive personality, as well as his obsession with Eva...his possession of her.  Rawr!  But gawd, I was crackin' up at the ridiculous amounts of verbs and adjectives to describe this \\"intense\\", \\"forceful\\", \\"domineering\\", \\"confident\\", \\"arrogant\\", character..(on and on it went) with TONS of magnetism..oh!..and with a tragic, emotionally scarred past (but of course!).  Pages and pages dedicated to pounding into our heads just how hawt this Alpha male was.  Overkill y'think???  Reduntant much?? Cripes!!!  For me, it just became progressively tedious.<br /><br />The parallels to \\"50 Shades\\" were, unfortunately, astronomical..<br />1. Both Gideon and Christian are bazillionaire megalomaniacs with aggressive, controlling, possesive/obsessive issues. (but then most successful megalomaniacs ARE)<br />2. Both have traumatic emotional issues stemming from child abuse/neglect.  Both are dysfunctional in correlation to<br />  relationships.  Both don't do the romance/hearts/flowers spiel.  Both don't date.<br />3. Both are withdrawn from family and friends.<br />4. Both meet their future female interests the same way.<br />5. Both suffer traumatic nightmares and both are silent about their pasts.<br />6. Both have the same number of siblings, and both have flirty brothers.<br />7. Both live on pins & needles - fearful about screwing up the relationship they're in.<br />8. Both prefer brunettes...<br />9. Both support, and are spokespersons' for Child Abuse Charities.<br />10.Both have former significant Ex's in their lives.<br /><br />Eva (and FSOG character \\"Ana\\"), live the same scenario.<br />1. They both move to a new city, new job, new apt., and find a new boyfriend.<br />2. Both suffer intense insecurity, low self-esteem issues.<br />3. Similar jobs.<br />4. Both have mothers who've been frequently married.<br /><br />  But while I can accept all these similarities to \\"FSOG\\", the sometimes cheeeeesy, sappy drivel-for-dialogue in this story was close to impossible to stomach with a straight face..I mean ARE YOU FRIKKIN' KIDDIN' ME?!?  I was cringing and groaning (and not in a good way) with all the stupid, insipid remarks Ms. Day put in Gideons mouth!!  He's supposed to be a Business Magnate Genious for cripes sake!!  Reading about a serious moment and then this Author ruins it by taking all credibility away with laughable drivel?? I was bustin' out laughin' at moments that were SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY and all because of this Authors' lame dialogue!<br /><br />Gideon and Eva both suffer from the same damaged issues.  They're both insecure.  They're both fearful of rejection & failure (in a relationship)...Eva more so.  Because of these issues, they each, in their own way, expect the other to fail them.  Therefore they either run & escape, or push away and distance themselves....wanting to be the first to \\"end it\\".  Eva doesn't want to be the one left behind; she wants to be the one who leaves - - it's her recovery/protection technique.  Her coping mechanism.  They both have pasts that they're running from...that they're humiliated by.<br /><br />The best part of this book (for me) begins after the break-up...or what is thought to be a break-up.  And even then, the break-up is devoid of real emotion..just...\\"blah\\".  As if it's really no big deal.  Like, \\"get over it and move on\\" type of deal.  After the type of emotional dramatic relationship that Eva has with Gideon, you'd think there'd be more attention to detail concerning the break up.  More time devoted to this sad, traumatic part of their relationship.  Yet, some of the best dialogue takes place AFTER this (so called) break-up.  It's as if Ms. Day finally got her groove goin'.<br /><br />I wanted to badly to reallllly like this book, as I liked both characters and sub-characters (Cary) so much..and through all the sappy dialogue, I liked the dramatized concept of this plot - - that is, two damaged individuals attracted to each other and seeing the possibility of \\"more\\" in one another.  And I gotta give credit where credit is due..Ms. Day can sure write a steamy, erotically raw and sexy sex scene.  (fannin' m'self)...But the best part??  For me the best part was Eva turning the tables on Gideon & pulling the rug out from under him, by not immediately returning his advances.  THAT alone made it all worth the time to attempt to overlook incredibley dumb banter and muddle through.<br /><br />Yet I'll keep this book and I'll read it again...because even though it wasn't all that good...it really wasn't all that bad either...and on rainy days with a warm fire cracklin', and a glass of Cab....it'll be worth a second go 'round...as long as you don't compare it to FSOG!  Read it and let it stand on it's own.  You'll probably enjoy it more.umatic part of their relationship.  Yet, some of the best dialogue takes place AFTER this (so called) break-up.

B003IN7YPU|3.0|Be careful with this set! While the NTSC American edition is also available, this is the PAL edition, which is generally only playable on European TV sets. Order at your own risk!
1781161097|4.0|Although the film itself left me feeling rather indifferent and underwhelmed, being a fan of production art of films I enjoyed in general, Prometheus: The Art of the Film was a no-brainer to add to my collection. The text is informative and the illustrations are lush, rich and really convey the intentions of the artists involved. My personal highlight of these types of books are the 'What-If' and 'Paths-not-taken' artwork and storyboards that either never made it to the finished film or were left on the cutting-room floor for whatever reasons. Any ALIEN fanatic can purchase this book with a high-confidence level that you will be adding a quality item to your personal library. Only complaint I can stress is that the glossy pages (as with most of these type of coffee-table top books) stain and pick up finger-prints VERY easily. But, that is usually the price one pays with the handsome presentation of glossy pages in general.
B005ETKNJ0|4.0|This just keeps going and going and going..... Lots of words about characters I have stopped caring about. 3000 pages into this epic and I feel like we should be much further into the story. I find myself thinking of King Arthur in Monty Python's Holy Grail during the holy hand grenade scene when Brother Maynard is droning on about the carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals.... Skip a bit Brother.  Martin tends to give long lists of knight or songs or foods, just like the scriptures read by Brother Maynard, you get the feeling Martin must be getting paid by the word.<br /><br />Given the volume of words you would expect more of the characters to be more than one dimensional. Some are some are not.  With each new chapter titled after character it is about you know in advance whether to care or not. I do find myself skimming many chapters depending on where the story arc is for that particular character. Many chapters do not drive the story forward or develop the characters any further - just repetition on what we have already been told.<br /><br />That all said, I do like this series. These are fantasy books for adults and that in and of itself is worth it. A complex story and bravery that you do not get from most authors.  They are well written and you are able to, for the most part, suspend disbelief.<br /><br />I know there are four more books after this one. I don't know if I am looking forward to or dreading them, I do know I will read them. With seven books already written my advice it too late for Martin and his editor but to those who will try to emulate Martin, I say - dude get to the point. To the  editors who will edit those who will follow Martin, grow some balls and cut extraneous verbiage when at all possible<br /><br />Last thought - the book is heavy - literally - read at a table or desk you will need to rest in on something
6304711905|4.0|Exceptional western with a good cast and pacing. Russell and Kilmer play Wyatt and Doc well, and Sam Elliott is a nicely cast Virgil Earp. It doesn't quite match up to the Costner version, which I consider a superior film, but still well worth seeing.

B007BVOF8E|5.0|Brilliant adaptation of the LeCarre novel about Cold War intrigue and the search for a mole inside British intelligence. Oldman is perfectly cast as the lead character George Smiley, giving a terrific performance as a world weary, cynical man. He has an ideal supporting cast with players like Ciaran Hinds, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, and John Hurt, all of whom excel in their roles. A well paced and intelligent espionage tale that requires your full attention, this one was one of the best films of 2011, if not the best.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|This is the finest of all of the so-called \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" by Sergio Leone, or any of his contemporaries. It is very long so make extra popcorn, but worth the watch, even if you don't particularly like other westerns from this era, or even westerns in general.  Despite being over 40 years old, it's still very watchable for a modern audience. And compared to other movies made in the 1960's, this movie is light-years ahead of its time in production technique, story, acting, writing, direction, and music.<br /><br />The execution is not flawless by modern standards, so you should bear in mind when you watch:<br />- the sound effects are not well mixed by modern standards<br />- the pacing is pretty slow compared to a modern action film, but it also has a lot of good tension in it<br />- there are a few not-so-good actors; if this movie had been made today it would have had better extras<br /><br />But even so, \\"Once Upon a Time In The West\\" is a landmark in filmmaking, and also a darn good movie. Must see.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just don't understand the hype over this book. I'd kept hearing about it, and when my best friend said she was reading it, I went ahead and bought it so we could talk about it.<br /><br />Wish I'd kept my money.<br /><br />The story line is stupid, the main character apparently has lived under a rock her entire life, and Christian Grey is a joke--27 years old, a philanthopist, kabillionaire, impossibly handsome, broken yet strong.... Bleh. The book isn't well written, the characters are poorly developed, and really there's no plot other than they have sex on every page.<br /><br />And... I was expecting something kinky. It really wasn't. I've read \\"9 1/2 Weeks,\\" \\"Story of O\\" and the Sleeping Beauty books by Ann Rice and \\"The Crazy Lovers\\" and \\"50 Shades\\" was tame compared to all of those.<br /><br />Don't waste your money like I did.

0439023491|4.0|An enjoyable read though not as well-written as The Hunger Games.  Rather than just standing on its own merits at times it felt like book 2 in the series existed just to get us to book 3.  If she's going to spread out the story into three parts then the author missed an opportunity to give us a greater glimpse into the other Districts and the daily struggles of their residents.  There's not a lot of detail on what goes on during the victors' tour and much of what we know about each District comes anecdotally from Katniss.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to tie each District's industry to a specific geography within the U.S. and also to know how and the extent to which each District's residents are oppressed.  Clearly they all suffer greatly but their daily challenges and the level of government intervention in their lives differs dramatically among the Districts.  A better view of life outside of District 12 certainly would give us more meaningful background as we meet each challenger and try to understand their motivation.  And given the length of the series I'd have liked to known more about how the current districting came about and what led to the original revolt.  Still a good read but I felt like we've missed a relevant part of the story.
0312330537|5.0|Shataram is a fantastic novel.  It was recommended by a friend in the travel industry.  The plot engrosses the reader into Bombay.  India is at the top of my list of places to go.  Written very smart.  Although it's a long story, the pace is not slow and by the end of the story, I wish it would keep going and going.
0345803485|5.0|In the beginning the book is very boring until you get to chapter 9, then it is very intriguing.  Overall, this is a very good book.  I would recommend.
1401235417|5.0|A well-executed Batman tale is a thing of beauty for any superhero fan. When a story pulls together the elements that make the Dark Knight a perennial favorite icon--his fighting prowess, the sharp detective's eye that notices what normal people don't, the drive to eliminate crime in the most hellish city on earth--readers stand up and take notice. Batman's strength lies in his lack of superpowers, his utter humanity...even if his stories often take him ridiculously beyond the limits of the human condition.<br /><br />The Court of Owls is one of those well-told Batman stories, wherein Scott Snyder's writing blends beautifully with Greg Capullo's striking artwork. It's part of DC's New 52 relaunch of 2011, and it introduces us to a brand new enemy (or group of enemies, more accurately) to add to Batman's rogues gallery. The Court of Owls has lurked behind the scenes in Gotham City, committing murders, running crime, and more, for decades on end. Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has heard the rumors of the group's existence ever since he was orphaned as a boy and believed the group was responsible for his parents' murders. But since he never found any evidence to prove the Court was real, he banished them from his mind. Now as an adult, and a costumed crimefighter, he still doesn't believe they are real, and that stubbornness may cost him his life.<br /><br />Even when the story pushes Batman well beyond the limits of human endurance (doesn't every Batman story push him beyond the limits of human endurance?), it still manages to retain the reader's interest in captivating ways. There's often been a running theme in Batman tales to place the Dark Knight inside the walls of Arkham Asylum, and this collection takes another twist on that, with a drugged Batman left wandering a maze for days on end, unable to get out. Refusing to be broken, he perseveres on, but at a tremendous cost.<br /><br />The biggest complaint with this collection is that it ends in the middle of thesaga. This is an ongoing story, and readers will have to turn to the single issues of the comic book series or wait for the next volume to get more. But as with every well told Batman story, that wait is worth it.<br /><br />Reviewed by John Hogan
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins is, without a doubt, one of my favourite contemporary YA writers. She's up there with the likes of Jenny Han and Elizabeth Scott, who are also both brilliant. Perkins' novels are really easy to read and get lost in, and Lola and the Boy Next Door is a fantastic, romantic addition to her growing library of novels. I was hooked within the first couple of chapters and didn't put it down until I'd finished it!<br /><br />As was the case with Perkins' first novel, Anna and the French Kiss, Lola and the Boy Next Door features characters so layered and complex that they actually seem real. So much time and effort seems to have gone into making them this way, and every little detail is presented and explained on the page. I come away from these books feeling like I really know these people and understand what they're going through, and that to me is great storytelling.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is about exactly what the title suggests: Lola Nolan and Cricket Bell, the boy who moves back to the house next door after two years away. Even though Lola already has a boyfriend, the sexy bad boy Max, there's something about Cricket that leads her to reevaluate her life and her choices. It's typical of teen drama, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but the way Perkins writes her characters is what makes all the difference. It seems almost effortless, although I'm sure it actually isn't!<br /><br />I liked every character in Lola and the Boy Next Door, especially lovely Cricket and Lola's parents Andy and Nathan. They're the coolest gay parents I've read about, and props to Perkins for rightfully including them in her story. She rocks! I also liked Lola, but not as much as Anna, which brings me to one of the most exciting parts of the book: cameos by Anna (*fangirl*) and Etienne (*swoon*)! I couldn't have asked for more, really.<br /><br />Although I really did enjoy Lola and the Boy Next Door, parts of it seemed a little unrealistic, like how Lola could make an item of clothing perfectly in just one night. I also didn't like it quite as much as Anna and the French Kiss, though it wasn't far off. I can't wait to read Perkins' next book, even though it's not being published until 2013. I'm sure it will be well worth the wait!
B0040JHL4K|5.0|I have a mild pronation problem and at 6'1\\" 225lbs I also need the stability I get from the Adrenaline series.  I've been wearing Brooks shoes since 1997.  Get some help from them to determine which model/style is best for you and end the pain.  If you walk, jog, or run enough to be able to tell the difference, you will switch to Brooks.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I find it really easy to beat but it helps pass the time, nothing more or less than what I'm looking for.
B0046LC14M|4.0|I really like this show, I wish they made more episodes. I like all the actors in this, it sucks you in.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is such a great app to organize yourself although I would love it if they would ad a calendar feature
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  I found myself staying up later and later because I couldn't find a good \\"stopping point\\". I just wanted to keep reading!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love love love this game, it is soooo fun and just like the pc version  i would pay 5.00 for the game
B007LNJ3YS|1.0|This has NOTHING of redeeming value. I can't believe there were critics, not just we amateurs, that gave this a high rating. Literally I can't stay awake.<br /><br />But it's a good thing I'll never listen to it again because this is another of the extremely annoying LP's that play at 45 RPM. I already got into a small verbal battle when I castigated Dawes' \\"Nothing Is Wrong\\" for being 45rpm. Listen yokels, if you are fine with the speed change, I'm not name calling you. But I'm not fine with it. To me it really sucks. I want 33 1/3 for consistency if nothing else. And as another stated you can't tell the speed from anything on the jacket or in Amazon's display. And I really blame Amazon for this as well as their inability to detail a vinyl single as being 7\\" or 12' and whether it has an big or little hole on the 7\\". Can't be hard to decipher.<br />I'm not done-- while listening (or trying to) to side 4 I couldn't figure out why the record wasn't rejecting, but just clicking. Turns out you have to lift the tone arm over a blockage to hear the last cut. I know it's not the first time I've encountered this, though it's rare; and quite STUPID. I have some  early 20th century 78's with an ending blockage but that was to protect the needle. This has no purpose but to annoy.<br /><br />If you own nothing by Beach House- - - keep it that way.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great and awesome game would recommend to anyone. I think think this is one of the greatest learning games on the market
B006LSZECO|5.0|Since I write Historical Romance, I usually gravitate toward those books, with some exceptions, like Danielle Steel and Stef Ann Holm.  After reading the wonderful reviews, I had to jump in and see what this book was all about.  I was totally amazed at how much detail she puts in each paragraph, even with Nick Dunne getting out of bed, or explaining how how he'd like to get inside his wife's head.  Truly amazing writing.  I highly recommend this book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Racing in the Rain was one of the best and most inspiring, heartfelt pieces I have read. I am the owner of three Golden retrievers and this book was recommended to me by my Oncologist who also had a Golden Retriever. We talked about how smart they were and \\"if only they could talk\\". He said I have the perfect book for you to read if you are a dog lover. I am not usually a reader, but I read the sample, ordered the book on Kindle and finished it in three days. I cried like a baby at the end but throughout the book, I could picture my eldest (12 1/2 yr. old Golden) Mariah, and completely understand how she see things now, how she feels (hip displaysia and arthritis)and I tell her out loud every day that I love her!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is great! I recently finished the Fifty Shades series and wanted something within the same genre. Beautiful Disaster is no where near as descriptive or \\"dirty\\" (as I've heard Fifty Shades described), but the story line has kept me glued to the book. I read this in two days; it really is such a great story of how we as humans, especially women, think. Abby tries to convince herself that Travis is not the one for her, and in all of her attempts to prove this to herself, she is really falling deeper in love with him. Really shows you can't always choose who you love. Great, great book! Highly recommened!
B005LAIGP0|1.0|This movie looks pretty awesome and I'd love to see it, but I won't buy another Ultraviolet movie. Ever. Find this review not helpful? Then you're not paying attention.  Ultraviolet is a scam and that makes the item suck.  Nuff said.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I just don't get all the negative reviews.  Haywire is an exciting gem of a film, with a minimalist almost stripped down 70s feel in terms of locales and ambience.  The fight scenes are excellent, and Gina Carano has the makings of a real action star.  The plot was fairly well put together, and the cast was terrific.  I really would like to see her in some more of these types of films.  Maybe a series is in store for \\"Mallory Kane\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this thoroughly.  I would encourage people to give it a chance.  It is a solid thriller and she definitely holds her own.  The fight scenens, containing some ultra authentic MMA moves, are outstanding.  Very enjoyable.
034580404X|1.0|This book was a waste of time and poorly written. For example, count how many times the author uses the words blushed, flushed, and hitched. So many books...too much time to waste on this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very easy to play and the finger control of the Kindle Fire keeps it natural. Visual effect of the cards is excellent.
0345803507|5.0|This was a great set of books & the final one was the best!  At least things worked out for them in the end!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Addicting. Only problem I've encoutered is trying to accept friends on my Kindle. Fun for me and my kids... now my husband has downloaded the game and can't put it down.
B0000A7W14|5.0|This is a great movie - It seems very genuine and un-bias - Truly shows the struggles of growing up in poverty and how some overcome while others do not. There are a lot of underlying themes, including coming-of-age, adolescent friendship and intimacy, and the effects of poverty, varying parenting styles, and violence on adolescent development. The director did an excellent job.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I picked this up as the FAOTD but even if I hadn't, it would still be worth the price.  The game play is pretty intuitive and there are no excessive permissions required.  The display is pleasing to the eye and there is no obnoxious music or sound effects.  One thing to note is that this game is best played on a tablet.  Some of the more difficult puzzles can be quite large so you're going to need a lot of screen real estate to display them properly.  There is a zoom-in feature, but as others have said, it can get a little tedious constantly having to zoom in and out in order to mark the tiles and see the clues around the edges.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent title.  If you like puzzle games then this one will not disappoint you.
B000007OTH|4.0|This is a truly talented composer and an orchestra with competence and expressive artistry. Well worth the small price for such commemorating value.<br /><br />Anytime I feel the soul of the music, as in each of these pieces, I know the composer is a true genius, not simply for creating a complex concordance of sound, but through the sheer intensity of feelings brought forth. Understanding and comprehension of Bruch may bring deep felt emotion or even tears to your eyes as you reminisce, remember, reflect, or introspect as if in a daze or zombie like state.<br /><br />My opinion only !<br /><br />Good Day !
B006AZZPCM|3.0|this was once my favorite app.  then came the dreaded green button popup, which was only a waste of time.  and now, the app simply doesn't work.  I miss the old tubemate.  :'(
B007V5CF5K|2.0|I didn't have some of the problems others did...it downloaded on my kindle in less than 4 mins...great....I figured out the phone part ina min...great...I was deep in the game having a blast then without warning...it just stopped working....not so great. It froze my kindle completely! I have purchased a few other games from Alawar and I loved them and had no prob at all. I am dissapointed because up until the freeze..I was enjoying myself. So I shut down my kindle...restarted..and the game wont let me even open it back up. Like I said...not so great.....
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the continuation from the first book to this book.  The story kept my attention and I again was looking forward to reading the third book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very addictive game. whats not to like it was free also it starts out slow going but once you build things it keeps you busy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Obscene and juvenile !  I Couldn't get past the first 4 chapters. I can't imagine suffering<br />through the entire trilogy. I'm not square and have read lots of trash. This is the worst !
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I thought this was going to be an inspiring story of walking the PCT.<br />What I read was a loooong, dreary whine fest. All I could keep thinking with every turn of the book was \\"why did she do that?\\". If there is anything I learned while reading this book, it's what's NOT to do if and when I hike the PCT or AT.<br /><br />It saddens me that Ms. Strayed's irritating story was picked up by Oprah (although really, why should I be surprised, since Oprah has a history of choosing depressing, irritating stories?).<br />99.9% of PCT or AT hikers actually research their trip, choose their equipment wisely, don't whine, and have a compelling story to tell, and it will be those stories that I will now be seeking. This book will go to my library--no one else should have to pay to read this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty entertaining for free! There are lots of different challenges and little games to complete which are all very different. I recommend the app.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This is a continuation of the story from the previous 2 books, but has more the feel of the first book. I loved it.
0517548232|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough to my fellow Americans!! It is an easy read.  It's amazingly well written! It is covers so much and explains so much so very well for how short and easy a book it is to read!! A must read for all, but if your only going to read one economics book in your life, or you want the true Cliff notes book for how economics, finance, and money really works in this world and how they relate to government this is definitely your book!!  JCM
B000V1Z8KK|2.0|Familier plot, familier acting, familier ending.  Not a single original thought in this movie! I like Mark Wahlberg - only reason why the movie gets more than one star.<br />Aren't you tired, like I am, of a movie where a bad guy(s) are the corrupt/unethical/immoral/incompetant political/government forces?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read. I'm not exaggerating here. This book is horrible. The story is decent, but the writing level is that of an 8th grader. (And this is coming from a middle school English teacher!) As previous reviewers stated, the amount of repetition in the book is truly appalling. I have no idea why the author, a British woman, didn't base her story in the UK, other than that it was originally written as Twilight fanfic. No American college student speaks the way Anastasia speaks. The author clearly knows next to nothing about American culture and speech, and setting the novel in a country she obviously didn't research truly prevented the story from ever rising above the level of mediocre fanfiction.<br /><br />The story is decent, and once it gets turned into a movie, hopefully the studio will hire some decent writers to turn this crapfest of a novel into a remotely plausible screenplay. In short, don't read the book. Wait for the movie.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensley John Grisham is back to his older style of writing which I enjoy!  Looking forward to more of the same.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book ! I own it now! Very good with all the twist and turns ! A must give as a gift item .
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This app stinks! I got it and it took about 20 min. just for it to load. SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy quickly became three of my favorite books of all time. I was skeptical about the storyline, but Collins does an amazing job telling the story through a strong female protagonist. I became hooked after the first chapter! Would recommend to anyone, no matter the age or gender!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Opening the options to see the Kindle menu to use the back button to close the app was a pain - After the latest update you click options and there is an exit button now! (Cheering) I have say I'm addicted despite some flaws. I'm up to level 44 but can't finish all the goals because it would require me spending REAL money to do them - So I Don't! The game description tells you it enables real money transactions folks! Read all of the info on a game BEFORE you download!  Anyway I've enjoyed it - the only major bug is the being able to connect to Neighboring Villages - it goes to Gameloft now (update fixed it)  but I still can't see other villages :( Would be nice so I can earn or find acorns (since I don't want to spend rl $ for them!). Fun addicting game.
B001F12J48|2.0|I am truly confused. Reading the reviews it sounds as tho many rec'd a disc that is true 3-d. Mine has a 2-d disc and a 3-d disc that uses some cheasy kid cardboard glasses.  I have a true HD 3-d I just purchased a few months ago and was really looking forward to watching this in true 3-d.  I notice the casing does not say blu-ray.  Can anyone expand on my understanding (after the fact) that unless you get blue-ray 3-d you are not getting the true 3d dvd to be watched on the new tvs?  And why did some buyers get what seems to be the real deal as advertised and others such as myself get the \\"low budget\\" version?
0545123275|3.0|When I started this book, I was instantly engrossed. I couldn't put it down. But then, I soon started to realize how similar it was to that awful garbage some people call Twilight. The main character, Grace, it seems like she's entirely dependent on her newfound love. It just really bothered me how they didn't think about anything else but eachother and how obsessed they were with eachother.
B006BG7RI0|4.0|What a wonderful gift! A numbered souvenir box containing \\"Casablanca\\" on 3 DVD's, 2 of which are on Blu-Ray (viewer take note) with footage of the Warner Brothers' history as trendsetters of the early history of movie making. Comes complete with a poster and a coaster to impress your friends when you host a \\"Casablanca\\" party - be sure to wear Ingrid's hat!
B00845PV16|5.0|Overall a fun comic book movie, though quite different from the first Ghost Rider movie.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze, a stunt bike rider who made a deal with the devil to save his father.  As expected, the deal did not go as planned, and Johnny is cursed to walk the Earth possessed with a violent and powerful spirit who exacts vengeance upon evil-doers.<br /><br />While attempting to escape his curse, Blaze encounters a powerful child, the spawn of the devil, who's mother also made a poor choice in contracting with the devil.  Blaze discovers that if he protects the child from the devil that he can be released from his own curse as well.<br /><br />The film is filled with tons of stunts and comic book action.  It was fun to watch, though I figure it is easier to understand if you had watched the first film.  Like many superhero-type films, you will be disappointed if you expect much more than a popcorn-munching good time.  However it provides some great chases, thrills and fiery effects to overcome evil.
0061692042|4.0|The first half of the book seems redundant and circuitous,with a lot of \\"philosophying\\" and endles self- examination. But-- the writing itself is superlative, which keeps things moving--albeit slowly.  Then, things happen!  Including an encounter with pure evil in a cold forbidding place. Highly recommended with 4.5 rating.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This app is good and has a lot of levels. I would definitely recommend it to a friend any day.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the sweetest books I've ever read. It's not only well-written, but touching and funny. I think Enzo is my favorite dog ever. He's what all of us want to know our dogs are thinking...that no matter what we say to them and what we do, we are always Number One in their hearts. I couldn't stop thinking about it after finishing it. I think that's my highest praise for a book.
0061692042|4.0|In reading reviews for this book, I noticed that those who didn't like it had read the author's previous books. This was my first Richard Ford novel. I found the book to be a real page turner...it is rather lengthy and I read it in a weekend. Not great literature, but a fun read. I did think the second part of the book dragged a little...I tired of the descriptions of the slaughtering of animals. At any rate, I liked the book overall and would recommend it. The writing is good and the main character sympathetic.  I look forward to reading the author's other books (the Trilogy), which, according to some reviewers here, are superior to this good book.
B003MPHQRK|4.0|My 8 year old loves the video games, and wanted this doll.  Bought it for her.  She loves it.<br /><br />On the business side, things went down without a problem.  Was delivered on time.
B004XKMZVK|5.0|Great album from the eighties, saw the show a couple of times...and had the cassette version of this one only to leave it out in the rain and it was ruined.  Didn't want another cassette because no more cassette player anymore...I have one in the truck though but it eats tapes so there goes that idea...Hope you enjoyed my review and will download this one yourself...Great listen...
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I hesitated about seeing \\"Prometheus\\" (123 min.) in 3D, but when I heard that the movie was in fact shot specifically with 3D cameras, I gave in and went to see it today in a 3D theatre. I'm glad I did. The 3D visuals are pretty much outstanding throughout, set in razor-sharp perspective. So yes, it is worth the extra couiple of dollars to see this in 3D, at least in the theatre. I have no idea how well the 3D version will translate to your TV screen.<br /><br />As to the movie itself, while the story seemed a bit overly complicated at time, once the movie got rolling about 45 minutes into it, it was a non-stop riveting ride to the very end. At first I thought that Noomi \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" Rapace was miscast as Elizabeth Shaw, but I most surely changed my mind after seeing what she goes through in the second half of the movie, and in fact I think her performance stacks up well to Sigourney Weaver's. Michael Fassbender's performance as the human-like robot David is also worth mentioning.<br /><br />A special mention must be made about the movie's outstanding visuals. It really felt as rich as say \\"Avatar\\". As I was watching the movie, I couln't help but think to myself, \\"this sure looks like one heck of an expensive movie\\". Curiosity got the better of me so I looked it up, and indeed the production costs alone (never mind the marketing costs) are estimated at $125 million. Amazing. Even though the movie's ending is left fairly wide open with a clear path for a \\"prequel-sequel\\", I don't know that the studio will even greenlight it, unless \\"Prometheus\\" is a big hit (which is not likely; I wash shocked how poorly attended the huge theatre was that I saw this in). Bottom line, if you like a good science fiction movie set in space, regardless of whether you've seen \\"Alien\\", this is definitely worth checking out.
B005F6NA56|5.0|This album is smooth and chill, with an occasional boom and shimmer; just what I expect from Feist. Metals is as reactive as her previous albums; leaving my ears tin-gling! You will be completely ionized with this disc as you mix yourself with its piping and strumming beats. It's elementary my dear Feist connoisseur...purchase Metals.^-^
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I've been a Rush fan since ~1975.  Have every album they have ever released.  Clockwork Angels is a very good album in comparison to most new music being released today.  However, it does not compare to their releases in the 1970s and 1980s.  I listened to the CD today and there does not seem to be but maybe one or two stand out songs that reach out and grab you.  Just my opinion, your mileage may vary.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I really did enjoy this game. It is fun and challenging. I would have given 5 stars for this if it wasn't another one of the &quot;try and milk every penny they can out of you&quot; apps. This would have been a great $1.99 apps, and I think would be successful that way if not for additional content purchase part.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Please, would someone inform me if the DVD contains subtitles (in English) or else closed-captioning for the hearing impaired?  I absolutely love to hear all the words in the songs.
B004FOA84A|3.0|There's some serious potential here but it fails to deliver. Graphics on kindle fire are A+. Smooth game play. Mildly perplexing challenges. Interesting back story. Lost stars solely on the fact that I was able to complete the game in approx 2 hours after paying . 99&cent;. Not cool. Good effort though by the makers.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Great video quality, great sets, good acting, but the plot was created to make sequels.<br />I'd recommend this if you don't like closure to films you watch.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love TR on my Fire! I waited forever for it and definitely was not disappointed in it. love that there are no ads!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really nice app. It is easy to control, and is very fun. This app kept me entertained for hours! the only downside to this app is that it lags sometimes and causes me to die. you die every time, but it is still fun
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Downloading the app was easy and also to use it.  I do wish there ws a link to the full site so you can do more!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|AMD FX is the best processors you can find for so few bucks. Arrived fast and works great. Totally what I expected.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! Sometimes I play a bit to much. Its like once you start you never want to stop! There is one ity bity thing though. I mean it doesn't bug me to awfully much but sometimes when you want to turn you end up jumping. It doesn't bug me to much but be well aware before you buy this app. Otherwise it is so........ much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071R43MG|5.0|Joe has helped many \\"see the light\\" in terms of playability.  I really don't know how I could of learned so much without Joe. He continues to fascinate me every time I listen to him!!!  Who doesn't LOVE Joe?
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a fun and addicting! I mean I have it on my kindle and on my phone so I always have it. Halfbrick Studios did a great job. To me the classic one is the hardest.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Ive noticed the a few kiddies who think reality show music is good, dont like a real rock band playing real rock and roll.  Ive noticed many have been blown away by it.  It is as refreshing as when they appeared during the disco era.  Its maybe even more important now, as music has never been more manufactured and stale as it is now.  Its not just processed lifeless plastic, it has soul and is made by a band who has actually got to where they are by having enough talent to get through the very hard rise that bands used to go through to make it.  Not like the disposable image based flavors of the month that are cranked out now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome game to play! :) I really enjoyed playing and having fun. especially the variety of games it has to offer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so entertaing. I can win a few and watch the cards at the  end of the game. I play this during lunch.
B002BJGYUS|4.0|This show hits the mark!  As a mother and a daughter and more precisely a mother of daughters, I see a lot of myself in this show! LOVE Lauren Graham!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Swipe the box to the left and a button will come up asking you to delete. words words words words words.
B0086QS7N2|3.0|Music great and catchy, can't wait to see it live.  The production is simply over the top distorted, sounds like a misuse of a loudness maximizer. Please guys, remaster and rerelease so we can enjoy these tunes even more outside the concert hall.
B007Q476KU|5.0|As of late, I rarely come away from a movie thinking about it later. About 99.9% of the movies holly-weird puts out are forgettable the minute the movie is over. The movie industry has really taken entertainment to new lows as of late. War Horse was a definite exception. It had a story, a plot that tugged at your heart strings and made one think about the prices that have been paid by the previous generations for the freedoms we enjoy today. It also makes one realize the heavy price paid by those not even in the military during the times of war. This is a well done movie with no discernible political agenda, which is rare these days; it just told a story. As much as I despise Steven Spielberg and his politics, I have to admit, this movie was very well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|great fun. keeps your brain going!  always one step ahead. I recommend all to give it a try. I'm sure you sill get a kick out of it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't know why people are stuck on the price of this Kindle bundle. The cost is actually less than buying the 3 books individually at your local Target!<br /><br />I must say, the first book was OK, and didn't have me rushing to finish or read the 2nd and 3rd books with my busy schedule, but once I did start book 2 OMG! I think I spent the whole day reading it and then the 3rd.  At the end I didn't want the story to be over, I wanted more of Christian and Ana.  I wanted to know Elliot's story and how he entered the family, as well as how his relationship with Kate progressed.  I wanted to know more about their sister and Kate's brother and if they were an item in the end or not.  In fact I just wanted more!  I could see even more sequels where we saw the in between years and after the story ended.<br /><br />These are def. must reads.
B0086700CM|5.0|O MY GOD!!!! ITS FINALLY HERE!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER FOR IT TO COME OUT ON AMAZON! IT WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE AND ITS AWESOME TO SEE THE GAME ON A BIGGER SCREEN! ANYONE WHO RATES THIS LOWERE THAN 5 STARS IS WRONG!<br />BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books!!!!  I am a wife, Mom & grandmother and I very much enjoyed reading these books. I read all three books within a couple of weeks, I couldn't put them down. (they are on my Kindle) Books 2 and 3 were my favorite. The books are a love story between Christian & Anastashia and their healthy appetite for sex.(among other things) It most definitely is reading for adults. If you are looking for a \\"steamy romance\\" this is it!!!
B0083GDLL8|5.0|If you have a collection of Ziggy remasters maybe the reissue isn't for you, but this one sounds great and I recommend it to anybody that wants to hear a great version of Ziggy.  The packaging isn't that great, as mine came folded improperly, but the sound is awesome.  If you don't already have a copy of this album, I think this is the one to get.  I have both the LP/DVD and the CD, I haven't really decided if I like the vinyl copy so much more than my '77 RCA copy that it compensates for the steep price, but the CD sounds great and I've had it looping in my car since It arrived.  I have not given the DVD a listen yet, since I don't have a 5.1 setup, so I can't comment on that, but I'm looking forward to it and hope it makes the high price of the vinyl a little more bearable.  Despite the odd fold in my CD case, this still gets 5 stars because it's a 5 star album, whether it's just another pumped out remaster or not, this one is a 5 star remaster, and new fans should get this without hesitation.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cute characters!  loved the movie and am enjoying this app on my kindle. kids would like this game. easy to manuver.
B002VUFKG6|4.0|Don't expect a \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" part II. You recognize the author's style but there's really a lot of facts exposed. It's really interesting to read all that and it put things in perspective.
B0056WODZ0|5.0|I really love Ms Harrison's style of writing. It's funny, light, passionate and intense all at once and all of that comes through in Dragon Bound.<br />Pia is a thief and she is blackmailed into stealing from the oldest creature on Earth, a Dragon named Dragos. After finding out about the treachery of someone stealing from his hoard, Dragos tracks down Pia and that is where the fun really begins. From their very first meeting, then dodging political situations, getting kidnapped multiple times and then escaping, the sparks fly between them both.<br />I enjoyed following them as they fell in love, made a family and home together.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Theatrical edition:<br />Prometheus got the story, visual effects, but it lacks action. I watched the first hour of the movie and I felt boredom. Then, almost at the end I got my desired action. Another disappointment is lack of aliens from other movies. I don't know whether it was good or bad. We saw the new species, but as the prequel to alien I expected to see at least one facehugger. I don't really see much connection between Xenomorphs and those aliens. Then, at the end I wanted to see the scientist travel to another planet. Those who watched the movie, know why she would travel on that planet, but still they could just give another 30 minutes to show exactly what would happen. Ending didn't satisfy me. There will be no second part to the movie, so I felt disappointed. Still, it isn't a waste of time, just a little boring movie. And last but not least, I knew there would a famous actress playing in Prometheus. I expected Angelina Jolie. But Charlize Theron was chosen and she was great! I really thought that this decision would suck. I was wrong. She was by far my favorite actress in the movie. Others played good, but I had no feelings to them.<br /><br />Update:<br />I watched an extended edition (fan made) with the run time of 02:21:32. While the very beginning is boring, it was quite important to the plot itself. The theatrical edition features no xenomorphs, but in the extended edition there is a creature that is either a xenomorph or a pre-xenomorph. That moment was the only great moment in the whole movie. Only after seeing it, am I so much looking forward for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie.<br />While given extended cuts, we still weren't given everything and instead of adding the complete extended version together with theatrical version a fan of the movie had to manually put all parts together to make an extended edition himself. Unless you see the extended edition of the movie, you haven't really seen 'Prometheus'. We all know how much potential the movie's got, but extended edition is simply the best. I really want to see more special features and more deleted scenes put back in the official extended version. Also I hope the cast for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie is going to be different. I didn't like actors in this movie. Please get rid of the main surviving actress, like kill her in the early beginning of the second movie or just do anything.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Students of history will enjoy the newest Sherlock Holmes installment. Not only are you taken back to late 19th century Europe, but it has a plot that involves the national tensions in Europe that lead to WWI. A more down to earth plot versus the secret society of the first in the series, I think that gives the movie a better footing, although Sherlock Holmes did have brushes in his novels with topics that touched on the paranormal or fringe. This movie has more laughs than the first. Downey Jr and Law's chemistry is better than in the first movie. IF there are any weak spots in the film, I think its the casting of Professor Moriarty. I think Gary Oldman would have been a much better choice or Ben Kingsley. Jared Harris comes across as a weak pick, Mark Strong did much better in the first of the series. I went into this movie jaded by the overall rating here and I was pleasantly surprised that I loved the movie.<br /><br />My true wish was that release week on Blu-ray, that WB would have another BD Live cast event with Robert Downey Jr like the first movie did. Alas, instead it has something that is called \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" where RDJr gives some background into the making and writing of the movie, the importance of certain scenes, why some scenes came out like they did and the historical background of things seen in the film. It also has B roll and stills at certain points.<br /><br />I don't think that the the Maximum Movie Mode has the same impact as a BD Live screening, you really feel like you are a part of of a live, historic event because WB added it to the BD Live content so it can be experienced by those that missed it.  Although, Maximum Movie Mode wraps several types of extras into one mode (commentary, B Roll and stills) while a live screening only has the commentary.<br /><br />I am not sure that Maximum Movie Mode, a DVD and UV are worth the extra $10 at release. At least not to me. But I think the movie is great and if you look at the negative reviews, most are about a dislike of Ultraviolet vs the movie.ws, most are about a dislike of Ultraviolet vs the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What sets apart an entertaining read from a book that becomes a classic is the originality of the idea , the skill of the story-weaving, and the truth of the insights revealed.  This series delivers on every level.  If you haven't explored the Wool world yet, you should stop reading this review & just click the download button already.  Mr. Howey creates premises that while believable, still hold the power to surprise and puzzle.  His characters have depth and personality, without seeming formulaic or flawless.  I am looking forward to reading more from him and am headed back to download Wool 6 now.<br /><br />Edit:  I just read elsewhere that Ridley Scott has secured the film rights?  Talk about making my day!  I was thinking this would be a great movie if done right when I read it, and to find out one of my favorite directors is picking it up?  Woo-hoo!  Congratulations to you, Hugh Howey!

B00009RAJH|4.0|The varying incarnations of Fleetwood Mac had been slowly gaining commercial ground in the USA over several albums, but few would have predicted the mammoth breakaway success of 1975's \\"Fleetwood Mac.\\" The newcomers Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham provided an 'X Factor' the band sorely needed; Nicks being the ultimate space-woman front-person and Buckingham being a guitar craftsman/songsmith that gave the band's nucleus of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie (along with singer-pianist Christine McVie) a jolt of energy along with a congealed line-up.<br /><br />The songs speak for themselves. There was Christine McVie's dreamy \\"Over My Head,\\" her soulful \\"Say You Love Me\\" and Nicks' introduction to the world via \\"Rhiannon.\\" The group had newly magical harmonies with the mixture on McVie and Nicks (as well as Buckingham's rubbery vocals) that made many of the songs pop-out like previous albums hadn't before. Nicks' personalty, as expressed in \\"Rhiannon\\" and the tender, country-ish ballad \\"Landslide,\\" gave the band a new focal point, and Buckingham's oddball persona surfaces on the turgid \\"I'm So Afraid.\\"<br /><br />It seems like the eponymous nature of the album was by no means an accident. \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" was both reinvention and reinterpretation of the long-standing band's strengths with some new twists added. It shocked almost everyone by selling 5 million copies, and can you name another superstar album where the band is posed in a bathroom (as on this disc's back cover)? As unassuming as they may have seen it to be at the time, \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" marked a major turning point in America Music as the LA novices and UK vets spun a musical web that everyone (including former bandmate the late Bob Welch and associates like Walter \\"Magnet and Steel\\" Egan) wouldn't wait to capitalize on.

B007CKNX28|5.0|Well, no one can claim that Jack White was hoarding his best material for the Dead Weather or Raconteurs albums. \\"Blunderbuss,\\" his first official solo album, is top heavy with raucous guitars, southern-fried blues, big, liduid gutar fuzz-bomb solos, and White's odd view of the world. When your first song is about a woman who - literally - takes pieces of you with her, you know you're not in for your typical guitar hero album.<br /><br />\\"Blunderbuss\\" tackles the radical sides of love almost as viciously as Marilyn Manson did on his new album. On the big noise of \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" White sings about the femme fatale whose \\"spiked heels put a hole in the lifeboat.\\" Or \\"Love Interruption,\\" the acoustic-ish number where White wants her so bad that he wants to turn \\"His friends into enemies.\\" He's got it bad, and for us, that's good. Or the title track, where he moans that \\"doing what two people need is never on the menu.\\"<br /><br />Along with the great guitar, While pulls out an oldie to play about with (and would have fit in just as nicely on his production of Wanda Jackson), \\"I'm Shakin'.\\" Originally by bluesman Little Willie John (and well covered in the 80's by The Blasters), White gets playful, again about another questionable lady who'll make him 'noivous' or get his locks clipped ala Samson and Delilah. While I certainly can't psychoanalyze the guy's \\"Blunderbuss\\" obsession with threatening women, I do hear the grooves in the album that he's inspired to make. His guitar is doing the bulk of the talking, the songs are all killer. This is on my shortlist for favorite album of 2012.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This is the alternative music that mainstream has been missing. I wish this artist nothing but the best. The album is like hear Prince, Kanye West, R.E.M., Sixpence none the Richer etc. confused into one. I like it!

B007UXT6O6|4.0|The story of Brandon and Cissy (Sissy?) is an intense one of a pair of siblings that clearly come from a troubled past. I would have given it 5 stars but we never find out what demon lurks behind their shared but different problems. My curiosity in regards to the 'why' they are like they are leads me to want answers.<br />The subject matter is definitely 'adult' and not for some of the repressed masses here in the U.S. but if you look past the sex scenes... think of Brandons computer (this won't give too much away) the director is pointing out the high risk behaviors that our main character takes. It's part of the outcome of someone who may have been abused in some way as a child.. If you've watched this you'll recall Cissy's line about where they come from; that is our only hint at their shared darkness.<br /><br />I see this as a study on the result or impact that childhood trauma has, as seen in adulthood via two personality types and via both the sexes. In this capacity this film is an intensely accurate/sad portrayal of this brutal very human truth.
0823015017|5.0|This book is excellent for those polymer artists and aspiring artists who want or need to document color recipes. Also, it really does a great job of explaining color theory and, especially, how it applies to working with polymer clay.<br /><br />I love color and I love this book. As a commercial designer with over 25 years in the field and plenty of color classes at the University of Minnesota, I am not exactly unfamiliar with color theory, but I prefer to put it into practice! Polymer clay is the best medium I know for \\"playing\\" with color. I only wish it had been widely available when I was in college - I probably would have become a jewelry designer rather than an interior designer because I would not have been able to put the clay down.<br /><br />Lovely book for anyone with an interest in color and design. Well written and easy to follow.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second book in George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, A Clash of Kings has a difficult task to fulfill - several, in fact. After all, it has to a) live up to the high standards of the first book, b) broaden its scope substantially to deal with the repercussions of the first book's events, c) juggle a much larger cast of characters spread out far more widely than the first book did, and d) do all this without losing the strong grasp of characters and complex thematic depth that the series is known for. And somehow, A Clash of Kings manages to do all of that and do it brilliantly. As the title hints, the book revolves around a struggle for the throne of Westeros, a struggle that features at least four major contenders for the throne, as well as some major players who have yet to enter into the playing field. But it also has to follow the members of the Stark family as they struggle for survival in very different ways, track Daenerys and her dragons as they fend for themselves without Khal Drogo, and somehow also show the impact that giving the throne to the sociopathic Joffrey has had on the kingdom. As in the first book, Martin manages all of this by juggling a wide array of perspectives, and the end result is a compellingly complex world where there are few true villains or heroes. No matter who you identify most with, it's likely that he or she plans the death of other characters you like, to say nothing of the fact that no one here is ever truly virtuous. That should come as no surprise to anyone who read A Game of Thrones, which seemed to make a central thesis out of the corrupting effects of power; what makes it harder to take in Clash of Kings is the fact that the book focuses on the effects these rulers have on those below them, be it through war or fear of tyranny. Martin's series continues to be one of the finest fantasy works being written today; its complex and thoughtful themes, rich and fascinating characters, and complex plotting all come together to make a phenomenal world that's more than just a series of battles and wars. I'm still enjoying my decision to read the books after they finish airing in the show (despite the fact that things keep being spoiled for me), but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't dying to read book three right now instead of waiting another two seasons to do it. But I guess that's a testament to Martin's books, isn't it?together to make a phenomenal world that's more than just a series of battles and wars.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|This movie is amazing and pushes the ever expanding idea of love. I never grew up with a brother, so maybe that is why I did not get the eww factor that everyone else initially experienced when watching this film. Honestly I found that it pushed a boundary that needs to be pushed tastefully. I love how the characters were shown as children and how it blossomed into the deep love that they have for one another as adults. After I watched this movie I had the immediate feeling of wow that was hot but kind of wrong, but then I thought some more and really dove into the subject matter. Except for social norms and acceptance what is wrong with the scenario that played out in the film. Two consenting adults who grew up together became best friends as children and eventually discovered that that they loved each other, they just happen to be related. I think in the synopsis offered of the film by Amazon that the key idea of being from stable ordinary loving family is important because that is the first thing that nay sayers point to when the concept of incest and homosexuality come up. 1) The family is unstable and unhealthy, and 2) there was probably child abuse going on that turned these men onto each other. That is just the preconceived notions that I think the director and the writers wanted to fight when producing this movie. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who has an open mind and ability to think logically (without religious or social pressures)about the overall message behind the film, that you sometimes cannot choose who you love and if you could why wouldn't you choose someone that you have known From Beginning to End.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|The game is simple to play and so addicting.  It was hard not to continue to the end. Only thing that made it complex is that they didn't explain the charms so I went the entire game without using them.
1594203334|3.0|This is certainly a decent enough read, but there's nothing here to justify the rave reviews it's garnered nor to provoke any controversy or anger.  It's quite good, but one you'd want to borrow from the library for a week, or order from a cheap marketplace seller.<br /><br />Despite what the best rated comment said I'm certain the author was not initially unsure about France.  Sure there's a few things along those lines early on in the book, but I'd bet the mortgage that although they now appear near the front of the book they were written near the end, to show 'the journey' of conversion from a skeptical expat to, largely, converted 'French parent'.  I'm not saying she had no qualms about having children in a foreign land but essentially she's a massive Francophile immensely pleased to be living in Paris and, oddly, somewhat star-struck by (what seems to me ordinary) parenting.  She does come over as quite an oddball in a way - hopefully it's just part of the spiel to differentiate her as an American from the French parents she's about to 'study' - but she seems a little insecure about herself as a parent, someone who needs(needed) a branded parenting 'method' to follow blindly and wholesale.<br /><br />Parenting is about the easiest thing on earth, that's why everyone can do it and children aren't dropping dead every second of the day, but she writes as if she needs advice on everything, that everything comes as a revelation - from the novel notion that you might actually talk to your baby even when (s)he's too young to talk back, that you should explain things to young children/toddlers/babies 'cos they may well be taking it all in even if they can't process it right now, to baking cookies on a sunday, to you being in charge (why? because I said so), to expecting your children to say hello to a guest who comes to the door, to being quiet when mom's on the phone - all this basic stuff seems to blow her mind as examples of French parenting-in-excelsis.  Lord knowswhat kind of childhood she had that these things are so mind-boggling.<br /><br />I picked this up as we had lived in Paris for a couple of years so I know the place pre-kids, and also I'm English, married to an American and raising children in New York so I thought the 'bi-cultural' investigation would be interesting, fun.  It was to a point.  She's right about NY preschools, right that quite a few middle-class Anglophones like to tick off milestones with as much rapidity as possible and that many see life as a race.  Perhaps it is more so than in France, where so many work in the public sector, but that's another story.  Those are good points, and the contrast with France is illustrative of a different - arguably better and certainly less stress-filled- approach.  I wonder if Chinese Mothers can fight the system in France or if they're content to let little Jacques-Feng do finger paints until he's 5 without learning the alphabet.<br /><br />There was a lot of just normal adult behavior that was manufactured as a 'thing' - the whole 'cadre' thing I thought bogus.  The fact you enforce rules and make your children say please, thank you, hello, be polite, honest and fair is for most just instinctive normalcy, such that it doesn't deserve a 'name', even if you point out that it's done unwittingly a name implies it's a real thing, however ethereal.  There was a fair bit that was contradictory in the first 2/3ds of the book - mainly caused by the fact that she labels so much that should fall under the heading 'common sense' as a specific designed, national, co-ordinated if unspoken approach.  Fair enough you might think, she has sold the book to a publisher and you've got to put something down, even when there's not really a whole lot to say.<br /><br />After a while it becomes a little more true, if basically a little pointless, in that she starts to say that 'French parents do A.  Except they're not rigid, so if that doesn't work they try B.  And they're not too proud to try C if that doesn't work'.  You don't say!!  Basically decent French parenting, except with cultural specifics like 3 course meals every day and their attendant rituals, turns out to be more or less identical to decent British parenting, or decent American parenting and no doubt decent Bulgarian and Bolivian parenting too.<br /><br />She does tend to use extreme examples from America and contrast them with mainstream decent parenting from France to declare France the winner by illustration.  There are too many times when (middle/upper-middle class) Americans are all neurotic crazies experimenting with vegan diets, baby sign language and golf lessons for their 18 month old, and then thrown up against just plain old sensible but attractive Mme Clothilde who turns up all sensible and firm but fair.  \\"Aha, French Parents Win!!\\" as she doesn't need to say.<br /><br />The comparisons are often slightly disingenuous - for example giving the nationwide average of child mortality France vs US while purporting to compare middle/upper-middle class parenting.  France has universal healthcare and the best/worst is narrow, America has healthcare that is far better (than in France) for those parents the author is supposedly focusing on, the national figure dragged down by the mortality figures of poor and immigrant America.  I'm sure the infant mortality rates (or indeed generalized healthcare) at Mount Sinai or Lenox Hill would be the envy of France.  That might be a take on the benefits of socialized healthcare (although when she calls things 'free' I'm not sure she's accepting the link to taxation), but it's not a strict comparison on point of her argument.  There were a hundred and one things like that - not comparing like and like - when I read the book, but it's not like I took notes on particulars, I just noticed them reading through.<br /><br />On a personal note it seems although the author is, rightly, trying to find a balance between her children's 'American' and'French' sides she's not concerned at all about her children having an English or British identity.  Their dad is British, as inconvenient as that may be to her.  I know it's a book written to sell in the USA but to constantly describe her children as Americans born in Paris seems like she's fairly deliberately cutting out one whole half of their biological identity.  The tone is ever so slightly annoyed that her one child speaks with a tinge of an English accent and positively thrilled when she was packed off to Miami and came back speaking with a fully American accent.  It's not keeping me awake at nights, but it was something that out of my circumstances I noticed.<br /><br />So yes, it's actually not a bad book at all, it's readable and if it's the type of book you're looking at on Amazon chances are you'll like it - but it's not great either.  It's a library read or a cheap seller that you'll get through in a week, pick up a few interesting things about how the system works in France, a few interesting things that French parents do slightly differently, a few amusing things here and there.  C'est tout.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing, without a doubt! and it is free :D besides that it sometimes freezes right when you take a turn and you get fed to the monkeys, it is made perfectly!
0439023521|5.0|My 12 and 10 year old kids just loved this book. They literally read it within 2 days each. Both have moved on through the series and cannot seem to let the books wait even a day... better than their usual ithingys !! Yeah!! Another win for books (first there was Harry Potter - now there are the hunger games).<br /><br />However I caution to add, that they don't pull punches on the violence... it's in there, and in your face when it happens...
B008B92U32|1.0|I saw the first two reviews for this and thought it would give me a few laughs. idk if its crap cuz I'm using it on my kindle but if I try to make the boxes too small it just automatically shrinks down to an unusable size. so I coudlnt even shape it to the right size for most pictures I have on my device. I don't recommend this app.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I was loving playing this but as someone else mentioned game opens up to black screen on Kindle Fire with no way to refresh back into game play. Don't know what to do at this point but appeal to CrossMe creators. Would definitely be 5 stars if problem gets fixed.<br />Alright working fine now and enjoying playing.
B0077SGMXM|1.0|This game is little more than a way for a shady Dev to sell nothing for real money.... $40 in app purchase in a paid game..... You can buy brand new Xbox 360 titles that took teams of writers, artists, coders, marketing departments , proffessional voice actors, motion capture, etc etc for less than this....... How do devs justify this level of greed?..... Disgusting.... uninstalled and forgotten.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|CrossMe is a highly addictive nonogram game for Android.  The purpose of the game is to either fill in or leave blank (x) boxes based on the only clues given: the sequence of filled in squares both for rows and columns.  With plenty of  puzzles at every skill level, there are a lot of puzzles to solve in this game.  I find myself solving puzzles for hours before I realize just how long I've spent playing.  Perfect game for travel when you have periods of waiting.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Hot, steamy, intense...luv it! Cant wait for the second. Great book to read after 50 Shades of Gray. Gideon is hot and sexy.
B0055S348W|4.0|I only wish it had an overlay option so you could print while in its overlay letting  you  print whatever you like and want in any app. I like that it works with my old 2006 HP all in one printer on a wifi connection. It required nothing for me to do but click find printer and choose my printer  and it did the rest. no effort at all. Definitely for anyone who wants to print and save time doing it.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninjas is an awesome app but there are adds but I still recommend it to all who love chopping up fruit.
B005938780|5.0|If you love awesome vocals and out of this world guitar riffs then this record is for you. Do yourself an favor and get this heavy metal gem.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend hours wasting time playing this. It is so addicting and fun. A great way to pass the time.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought this item for my daughter birthday and she is totaly in love with the set, that she wants me to buy the second season for her, which I will probably do. I want to thank everyone at Amazon for all the support you have shown me in buying this set. Thank You All Janice Nelson
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really outstanding work. Well thought out. Excellent character development. Good world building. And there's room for sequels.  Not much more an avid reader could ask for.  Other reviewers invoke a criticism for editing errors, and while this reader did indeed encounter some, one would observe that they were noticeably less frequent than in other contemporary work. Highly recommend this and place Mr Ryan on your author watch list.<br /><br />5 stars.  Absolutely.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|works great on the kindle fire. Adobe Reader is the easy option for opening PDF files. much better than the standard options available on the device.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is a great tool. I find it very informative. It is my pleasure to recommend this app to people.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game rivals Words With Friends, bringing a social atmosphere to the art of drawing. I love that it lets you watch a video of the screen of the other player drawing and watch as he guesses your own.
B0077SGMXM|3.0|The graphics is cool, physics is cool, the game is ruined because I can't save intermediate result, why is no one reviewing low for this reason?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app's interface comes with big buttons, turning your kindle fire into a 7-inch pocket calculator. I've downloaded others on the fire and since deleted them--this one is the best.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My sister got me hooked on Plants vs Zombies for PC so when I got my new Samsung Galaxy Note I knew I just had to have it. I don't regret it at all and now I have to get my sister a phone like mine so she can play too.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I bust this app out whenever I'm stressed. It quickly gets my mind off the issue at hand and helps me relax.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|Boy this crap really sucks! I cannot believe there is anyone out there that can even digest this bowl of CRAP. Good night Morrello. Thank god you got Chris Cornell to fill in for this so called singer, he sucked big time. Also, If I could give this drek ZERO STARS I would.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was relieved to find this app for Kindle Fire after searching among the other options. I bought it for the sync capabilities from and to Google Calendar. It syncs both ways. I can count the apps I've actually purchased and this has been worth every dime.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|love this book.......kept me wanting more of the story so I could not put it down.  ROMANCE, DRAMA AND A LITTLE HUMOR TOO!
0312641893|5.0|Cinder, the best mechanic in New Beijing, was working at the market when the Prince stopped in to have his android repaired. Even though she was a cyborg, she felt flustered and lost control of her brain's net connection. Her human part made it hard to focus. As she studied the android, they agreed to meet the next market day to check on the status of the repair.<br /><br />Adri, Cinder's \\"stepmother\\", hated her. Adri's husband had made them guardians of Cinder, an 11-year old cyborg. Adri owned her and the money she earned. When His Imperial Majesty Emperor Rikan came down with the plague, one of her \\"stepsisters\\" implied she ought to volunteer for plague testing. A royal research team had come up with the cyborg draft, choosing a number every morning from the cyborgs of the Eastern Commonwealth, using them to test for an antidote. Cyborg's were looked at as less than human. When Peony, the only human friend she had, came down with the plague, Adri had had enough. She volunteered Cinder for the draft. After all, she had no feelings, right? How was she going to survive? No one survives plague testing. Would she meet the prince again? What do you think?<br /><br />Cinder didn't remember anything before 11 years old . When she got to the research center, Dr. Erland began filling in some of the blanks.<br /><br />Even though I knew where this was going, I could hardly wait to get there. I didn't think I was going to be disappointed and I surely wasn't. I thought it was a unique twist on a known storyline and great fun to read. Numerous times I found myself laughing out loud. I have a love/hate relationship with it being a series. I hate not knowing the end, even though I know it. Know what I mean, lol?  I am eagerly awaiting the next book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312641893 Cinder: Book One in the Lunar Chronicles]]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|okay, I don't usually write reports and this game deservse it.its absolutely awesome.this game is better than gamelofts usual games.and just try the game
B002CNOA6S|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is absolutely perfect in this movie. His portrayal of an autistic savant is spot-on and is entirely believable. Though Tom Cruise's character is less likable initially, he does a great job portraying the confusing nature of the situation. This is one of those movies that everyone must see. It leaves you both laughing and crying.<br /><br />A++
0060899220|5.0|As a current working chef, I can say without a doubt that most if not all of this book DOES happen in real life. I found myself, every page or two, laughing, reminiscing, or otherwise considering calling former waitresses I once/twice knew. As I read the stories, I could assign somebody I work with or used to work with to almost every character in the book. That being said, the general public can rest assured that ALL of what is described in the book doesn't happen at every establishment; this is merely a collage assembled to depict the entire industry. Every place I've worked exhibited some of the traits shown in the text, and some more than others; but I can't emphasize enough how true and spot on Bourdain's exhibition is at lifting the curtain on how F/B establishments really operate in this country. From the neighborhood bar, to multi-outlet resorts, hotels, and clubs; this is truly the diary of the professional culinarian. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who eats out more than fast food, and especially to those thinking about or currently enrolled in a Culinary program.

Johnson found out the hard way that, unlike that hapless monarch, some will have an answer.)<br />the repair job makes all the difference. Matt Murdock's problems go from an intermittent nuisance to full-fledged \\"issues,\\" and we get to glimpse his previously glossed-over personal mission as lawyer to the downtrodden. the Kingpin's activities go from what seems like minor larceny to full-blown white collar infractions. in short, what the Powers That Be had removed was everything that would've given the film a shot at being unique.<br />as a comedy fan i'm particularly gratified to see some good courtroom scenes for Jon Favreau. it seems only fair as Favreau would further serve the Marvel machine by directing Iron Man.<br />as a rule i'm cynical of the \\"director's cut\\" concept, because it's so often little more than a director's narcissism and/or sour grapes. so it's good to see it used to salvage a film from the jaws of mediocrity for a change.<br /><br />[NOTE: as i type The Avengers is in theaters and pretty damn good by most accounts, but one thing gives me a certain pause. why was Daredevil, who is an Avenger in the comics, not invited? this is especially confusing as being in an even worse film didn't get The Hulk removed from the guest list. and anyway, what's the point of even bothering with The Hulk, since Bill Bixby is dead? what a world, huh?]activities go from what seems like minor larceny to full-blown white collar infractions. in short, what the Powers That Be had removed was everything that would've given the film a shot at being unique.  as a comedy fan i'm particularly gratified to see some good courtroom scenes for Jon Favreau. it seems only fair as Favreau would further serve the Marvel machine by directing Iron Man.  as a rule i'm cynical of the \\"director's cut\\" concept, because it's so often little more than a director's narcissism and/or sour grapes. so it's good to see it used to salvage a film from the jaws of mediocrity for a change.

1609611543|5.0|This book is very educational, and Dr. Davis makes a compelling argument for removing wheat from your diet.<br /><br />After only 30 days, I've lost 20 pounds and feel MUCH better!  I am recommending that EVERYONE read this book!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|OMG!  I am 1/2 way through the third book of this series and as much as I enjoyed the first book, by now I am growing weary of mounting orgasims every 5 pages. Do people really do it 5 times  day?? Sometimes I'm exhausted just after reading one of their many sexual romps. I am just looking for more in a book than sex, I guess. The end of the 2nd book got my interest enough to buy the third hoping for something more to the story than sex and emails. Some suspence, was finally brought into the picture with some one trying to destroy Christian Grey. But there is very little of that suspence, I was hoping for more action, more scary moments between the two, and maybe some excitement. The writing of these books reminds me of Twilight series. \\"Edward smells so good.\\" So does Chritian. \\"Edward looks so good.\\" So does Chritian. \\"I can't think of anything but Edward.\\" And same with Christian.<br />If you like well written smut books this is for you. All the romance you could ever hope for. I just like a little more to my books, but the public's interest got the best of me to purchase these.
B0062OCNAI|2.0|I'm sorry to say that I found this novel difficult to read.  It is just one step away from romance novels...and I don't like the point of view (a comatose woman in hospital).  I haven't finished it yet...I'm going to stick with it to find out \\"who done it,\\"  but not enjoying it.  Reminds me of Lovely Bones which I also didn't really enjoy.  Guess I'm in the minority.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you're publishing an eBook on Amazon use this to make your life simpler. I followed it easily and was able to sort out several minor problems I had with Microsoft Word. My version was written for Windows users but the differences for Mac users are only minor. Highly recommended.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Unquestionably, it's Brad Pitt's most mature acting role to date. It's too bad he didn't win an award for his portrayal of the Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane. (I think Pitt must have recognized the neurotic Hollywood mogul in Billy Beane.) Jonah Hill was very good in it, too.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this movie - I highly recommend it. The movie shows how Beane was able to conquer his own MLB demons and turn them into something positive.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|This is a very nice filter case and perfectly holds my three 77mm filters. It is well pouched so there's no need to worry about the filters being damaged during traveling. I agree with some other reviewers that the Velcro is a bit over the top and would most likely not be required. However, it also adds additional safety and if you have expensive filters then a safe case is what you are looking for.<br />The case is very well made and robust, it's not some cheap product. I think it will last for a long time and will accompany me on all my upcoming photo trips.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome. I love the varied reading plans and that it has audio. i highly recommend to anyone interested in the Bible.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever!!!!! if you haven't got it you need to!!! so buy it!! its the best game ever!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|sometimes glitches or doesn't let u do a certain move. other wise this is a great game and I'm happy that they finally put it on the kindle fire!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Awesome, retro, and epic Doodle God has me suiting like a duck about to be lit on fire by its pure power
B0015DROBO|2.0|This book was hard to get into. It's very dry and with all the Swedish references it's difficult to relate to and became frustrating. About page 200 you get past all the financial mumbo jumbo that I could barely see as relevant or necessary at the end, and get into some action. I hope the second book is better.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I really like this app!!! Because I was able to download music onto my Kindle Fire. I haven't had any problems with it! :)
B0075HO8P4|5.0|I love this cd and I keep it on repeat.with amazon mp3 i able to download directly to my phone. Excellent!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I must say I only turned to The Hunger Games because the Harry Potter series has come to an end. I know many people will be feeling the same way so I wanted to recommend the Hunger Games as an amazing next read. The first book was so additive, I made it through all three in a fortnight!<br />From a female perspective I enjoyed having someone I could relate to as the main character and being able to hear the thought process of Katniss made the books so more enticing.<br />From my perspective I can tell the quality of a book by its ability to pull me in to it. When reading The Hunger Games I am there, in the games, which is why I think The Hunger Games Trilogy is a MUST read for anyone who is looking for an escape.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|I bought Ghosts of Ascalon to sate my excitement for Guild Wars 2 in between beta weekend events, and I hoped to gain some roleplaying material as I read.  On that count, the book didn't disappoint.<br /><br />It's a well-enough written story in the classic fantasy mold:  Take one of each race, send them on a quest, watch them interact.  I did harvest plenty of material to give my roleplaying some flavor, but it's a good enough novel to read even without that motivation.<br /><br />For those who are interested in RP nuggets, though, I used the Fire's \\"share\\" feature to highlight the most useful bits.  Any Fire reader can see them by highlighting a portion of the book and hitting \\"share\\".  That will take you to other readers' shared items, and you'll have an opportunity to cancel posting what you highlighted, and just see what others have put there.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have not purchased the cd as of my review,but I have listened to all the song's numerous times on YouTube.This album is FANTASTIC..I still can't believe anyone would give this gem less than 4 stars..but everyone does have the right to their own opinion.But this is so good,just listen to the tune called The Wrecker..Turn it up,and close your eyes..It just sticks in my mind..I have been a big fan of Rush since the very beginning,and have seen them quite a few Tours,and hearing this great music on Clockwork Angels has me ready for another show..Just an incredible new cd from our friends from the North..
0375869026|5.0|This book is filled with heart. It's touching, a great plot, a book you don't want to put down, and it's filled with many important life lessons.  It's a must read for all. Brilliant!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Good music is good music, regardless of the genre.  We saw disco rise and fall (to much derision) not because disco was a bad genre of music, but because it became flooded with formulaic crap created to cash in on its popularity. But good disco was good music.  Today's pop music also has a lot of music assembled from parts known to be appealing, but without any substance or heart. But amid the product generated to fill up the airwaves there exists quality music that will someday be listed in a catalog called the Golden Age of Pop - music created by Lady Gaga, Pink, Usher, and more.  In this company enters Adam Lambert's Trespassing.<br /><br />The album is unexpectedly split into two parts, with all of the upbeat, dance tunes grouped together at the front. They're bright and happy, with witty lyrics, a solid dance beat, and polished, interesting arrangements.  Rather than being dispersed thru the album and interspersed with the more reflective ballads, as is more common, the grouping allows the energy to build and create a real club feel.  They're perfect for parties or exercising, but are also interesting enough to just sit and listen to.  The second half of the album is a very textured collection of ballads.  Since Lambert wrote on 12 of the 15 tracks on the deluxe version of the album, these songs are personal to him and capture an emotional content that is often rare in pop music.<br /><br />Beyond the songs, the arrangements, and the production there is \\"that voice.\\" People refer to Lambert's voice in quotations because it is extraordinary.  He has a multi-octave range that is as fully developed and controlled in the lower register and when he sings softly, as it is in the big, belted high notes that are almost de rigueur in today's hit songs.  Lambert can transition from sweet, soft, tender notes, through a rock and roll growl, to a full-throated, ringing tone, and up into a pitch-pure falsetto with an ease that is astonishing.  More importantly, he knows exactly when to employ each technique, with exquisite timing and musicianship for maximum effect, without the listener ever feeling that it's calculated or self-conscious. One song is not enough to appreciate the breadth of Lambert's vocal gifts and talent. You need to listen to them all!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|My only problem with this book is that within 50 pages I was horribly annoyed that the sequel isn't published yet. Wow. I am awestruck by this story. I could, quite correctly,  use the word awesome to describe Blood Song as I was in awe of the writer's talent all of the way through the book. The characters were beautifully rendered and quite believable. I had no problems with the editing, though I am normally a stickler for such things, as the quality of the story and the writing far outdid any problems in that regard. In fact, I was so engrossed in the book, I hardly noticed any errors. Although this is to be a series of novels this book wraps up quite nicely at the end though of course there are some loose ends. Now the long wait begins for the sequel. Hurry up Mr Ryan.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Don't listen to critics.  This movie is an absolute must watch if you're a fan of sci fi.  This movie is the father to Star Wars and Avatar, because this story came out WAY before those did.  And an example is the word \\"Jeddak\\".  Without spoiling what that means, doesn't a word in Star Wars sound familiar (like Jedi)?  After watching it once, I want to check it out once more.  Too bad it didn't do well in theaters, but maybe it'll make up in blu ray sales and on demand.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed, unless you just aren't into sci fi movies.
B0013XQMV4|5.0|My former friend picked up this album and tried listening to it. She's religious so she didn't listen all the way through. However, My rating is five stars all the way for the CD BUT one star due to the fact that the one she gave to me that she got is NOT the real album version. I discovered that it's the MP3 DOWNLOAD version which contains 99 tracks. Tracks 17-98 are nothing but 4 seconds of silence. REALLY??? Who in the HELL made the MP3 Download for this album to put freaking 99 tracks on it having 17-99 of silence and a \\"ghost track\\" as 99? No other MP3 Download is like that. They all have only the album tracks on it. But as far as the real album with 16 tracks goes, I pretty much like anything Manson creates and it includes Antichrist. :3
0312427999|2.0|There is little objectivity to this book. In defense of the writer, she admits in the first chapter that she believes capitalism is fundamentally bad with a few exceptions. The problem is that unless you feel the same way going into it, she will do little to convince you of that fact. One such example is a negative outlook on charter schools in new orleans after katrina without any mention of what their construction speed would have been if it were run by public entity, she also makes no mention of differences in child performance.<br /><br />There are some interesting anecdotes about shock therapy and the Chicago boys. However, she uses them to acheive far-reaching conspiracy theories whereby a single person is responsible for the overthrow of an entire government in the name of capitalism. Granted, many of these events took place during the red scare days of the 70s. But this fact is used to achieve some far fetched conclusions.<br /><br />She is also inconsistent in what \\"rules\\" are okay to follow in order to build her case. When government market manipulation ceases in South American countries and cheaper goods are available to those consumers, it is bad because they are not produced domestically in that country. When the United States enacts similar price protections defended for one country, it's once again bad.<br /><br />The far-reaching conclusions and inconsistencies lead me to believe that if the author had a show, she would be the Bill O'Riley of the left. You really have to be seeking your opium to buy the message this book is selling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it was great but you really have to be careful not to buy something but really its just a getter version of Oregon trail.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Look, if S&M is the new black, I get that.  However, if you're into getting whipped, I suggest your master or your mistress do it, because you're going to get more out of it.  I felt like a stupid, ignorant masochist reading it.  Too trashy even for bored beachtime reading.  You can only slut your way through it. So if you're better than that, read something else.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author is brilliant for most of the book.  The first part lags but she keeps you wanting more.  By mid-book, you're hooked...the writing is genius!  That is...until you get to the end...what happened?  Writer's block?  Really?  After all the brilliance, this is all you have for an ending?  If I wanted full throttle to flacid in a matter of minutes, I would have scheduled a date with my ex husband.  It's \\"War of the Roses\\" on a grander scale, but nevertheless, it's still War of the Roses and the end is an anti-climatic snore fest.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I purchased this game last year when it was the free app of the day. the dialogue is a little funky because of the translation from Japanese, but the story is good. I got a new phone recently and redownloaded this game... I basically started it over without caring because this game is just so fun to play. respeccing at any time is great too. no autosave can hurt sometimes but I like being able to save whenever I want.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Imagine taking the Word of God  with you wherever you go, having the God breathed, inspired  Word at your finger tips instantly and digitally, along with all the resources and tools to fill a room... all in the palm of your hand. Additionally the extra built in features and reading plans and widgets are phenomenal. This app just keeps giving.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this game and its a really good app. if you like the game then you should definately get the app
B0077SGMXM|5.0|there are sooo many levels it will take forever to get to them all. fun game and some of the holes are difficult. works well with no lag and I haven't noticed any bugs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked this up in the middle of all the buzz about it. Not a good investment. I'm an avid reader and not easily disgusted, but this book succeeded where others have failed. My advice is to save your money and your time.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive its fun spent an hour playing its so fun make sure to get it
0425241505|4.0|Have been reading Thea Harrison on and off.. But this one caught my eye and I'm glad that it did...I enjoyed it from start to finish...Now looking at the others...

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were great.  Could not put them down.  Would like to see book 4. Did not want series to end.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is cool and fun! I really enjoy it :D I'm gonna tell my frends to play it I'm shuree they sud like it Cuz itotally did hahaha I rated it 5 stars
1466401885|4.0|So I read the good and bad reviews and was iffy on reading it. Yes I do agree there are several items on hear that are irresponsible **spoiler* underage drinking, gambling, fighting etc. BUT if you are reading this book for an escape and something fun and a young romance then it's an pretty entertaining read.<br /><br />I couldn't help but really like Travis, so passionate and yet so desperate for love, understanding and in need of unconditional love.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's like an x-rated version of Beauty and the Beast. The entire book had me angry but the fact that E.L James was able to get that kind of reaction from me makes her an excellent author and definitely one of my favourites. I can't wait to read book 2.
B0007MUR2W|5.0|This David Bowie CD is a must-have for any Bowie fan. The CD I bought was $8 including shipping. It is in great condition with no skips or scratches on the CD and the liner notes are great to read the song lyrics. I like many songs on this CD and, although I already have \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" (title song) and \\"Suffragette City\\" from a greatest hits CD, I really enjoy \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\" and the bonus alternate versions of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" (acoustic) and \\"Lady Stardust\\". I can't wait to collect more of Bowie's 1970's releases.

0871404133|5.0|This is a tour de force from Wilson, who is arguably the US biologist who has the greatest sum of innovative ideas, respect of the scientific community, and ability to make complex scientific ideas accessible to the general intellectual public.  Nothing is more interesting to us than ourselves, and perhaps nothing is more psychologically difficult than standing back and looking at ourselves objectively.  Here Wilson shows us where we have come from, our evolutionary source of group morality as competitive with selfish drives, and how selfishness and morality will continue to war within ourselves and society.  I will say that he tries to jam too many thoughts into some of his sentences, which then must be read several times to chew the meat out of them, but it was invariably worth the re-reading.<br /><br />Amazon asked for a review of this book that I purchased, and I regret that it must be very short for the present.  But you will not regret reading this book.  I even sent a copy to a friend of mine, an intelligent non-evolutionist (if you will forgive that oxymoronish characterization) who thinks that as an atheist and evolutionist I have no basis for living a moral life.  We now have fruit for several more hours of fervent discussion over coffee.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A classic sci-fi that is based on the Shaekespeare's \\"The Tempest\\".<br />Lesley Neilsen NOT in a funny role.<br />Holds up extremely well over time.<br />The special effects were amazing at the time and still bring wonder.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Several things:  this movie is not what I expected. I had some vague idea there was fighting involved, and perhaps some racing around, and figured there would be a big \\"showdown\\" ~ after all, it's Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Also, I once had a huge fight with my ex, who wanted me to see \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". His argument: \\"War is an important topic and you need to see this movie.\\" Mine: \\"I know it's an important topic, and I don't *need* to see a movie to know it.\\"<br /><br />So, having said that, again, not what I expected. Although I am can be tender-hearted, I rarely cry at movies. I did at this one. And I think people *should* see this movie to learn what happens when the war is over.<br /><br />Clint's character is an old, racist, white man, who, after fighting in Korea, spent his life working for Ford. He has an old Ford truck, and a 1972 Gran Torino, his pride and joy, that incidentally he helped build. His wife has passed on, his kids hate him, he grandchildren only care about what he might leave them, he practically has no friends left, and his neighborhood is now filled with Hmong. Foreigners. Who he hates, wishing they would just leave the neighborhood - or at least keep their yards up.<br /><br />His neighbors hate him, and wish *he* would leave the neighborhood.<br /><br />Stalemate, until the young boy next door tries to steal his Gran Torino as his initiation into a gang, and he catches the boy doing it.<br /><br />I won't go too much into the details, but of course, bad things happen then. Good things as well.  And we learn, in a subtle way, how that war affected him. And his family and children. And his foreign neighbors, and their children. And what \\"sacrifice\\" means. I highly, highly recommend this movie. It will touch your heart.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This review is for the film Prometheus (3D version).  The film gets a 9 out of 10 rating, and the 3D experience gets a 9.5 out of 10 rating.  The film was filmed in 3D (not post-converted) and it looks amazing. There aren't any artifacts that pop out at the viewer, but the depth within the environments is amazing.  Highly recommend watching the 3D version. I'll do a review of the Blu-ray set when I receive it.<br /><br />As for the film, it was very enjoyable throughout. The reason for the 9 rating is because I felt like it was missing something.  The film was 2 hours long, and it feels like it should have been a two and half hour long film.  I think we needed more exposure with the \\"engineers\\", showing how they operated and even created the weapons contained in the urns.  I think we needed to get to know the crew better so we could feel more for them when certain members perish or are hurt.<br /><br />The pacing of the film was excellent, never seemed to get boring, but I think certain scenes could have built up the suspense a little more.  The camera work was excellent, and the environments look amazing. The technology and visuals were impressive.<br /><br />This film is in the same universe as Alien, but is not a direct prequel to Alien. It shouldn't be compared with Alien.  It's a different type of film as Alien, as was Aliens (Cameron's). Three unique films in the Alien universe.<br /><br />Prometheus is definitely a science fiction film worth watching, especially if you enjoy the Alien universe (although I ignore the 3rd and 4th films). And if you are new to the Alien universe, definitely give this film a viewing.  But you should watch Alien (Ridley Scott), and Aliens (James Cameron) if you get the chance.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|14.99 for an app?! Apps are meant to be 99&cent; or free not 15$! so I went ahead and bought it just to see what its like and its a total ripoff! me- completely disapointed.

B005LAIGWS|5.0|So, a lot of \\"critics\\" have felt the need to compare this movie with the 1st one.  This movie is in effect a remake of the 1st movie in that the \\"deal\\" is explained and Johnny Blazes' past as well, to a degree.  To compare these two movies would be like comparing Christopher Nolan's 1st Batman with any of the previous Batman movies, (save for Tim Burton's 1st one).<br />They are not sequels so the comparison is mute.<br />This one is darker, but not as dark as it could have been due to the PG13 rating, although the directors get a shot in about the ratings in the \\"Extras\\" section. (\\"Movies with \\"R\\" ratings don't make money!  Although \\"The Hangover\\" made more than a 100 million\\"(?).)<br />I enjoyed the movie, have watched it more than three times and since I'm on disability I can watch movies all day.<br />I wished they'd kept the original \\"Chopper\\" but that's OK too.  The bike in this movie is equally gnarly.<br />The important thing to remember is this is NOT a sequel, but a re-telling of the original story. The directors could have reduced the \\"crank-ness\\" in some of the shots, but it seems to be they're thing.<br />I enjoyed it and am glad my wife bought it for me.  I give it 5 Stars.

I'll admit that Battleship was a bit of a disappointment, but this... Holy crap!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Okay so Liam is playing a guy who kills wolves for a living and keeps oil workers safe in Alaska while they work on pipes for a nameless oil company.  So why are they all drinking, fighting, and gambling?  People in the freezing wasteland of Alaska really have nothing better to do with their time?  Okay sure, why not?<br /><br />Then the plane they're on crashes, and get this.  Liam's character lays down across 3 seats and belts himself in with all 3 seatbelts, yet he's thrown a few hundred feet away from the plane and the seats he belted himself to are nowhere to be seen.  Okay, I'll roll with it.<br /><br />Plane crash survival 101, STAY WITH THE WRECKAGE!!!  Unless you crash in the ocean and the plane sinks, STAY WITH THE WRECKAGE!!!  It's MUCH easier to find the wreckage of a plane than it is a single person wandering around in the woods.  Plus planes have transmitters on them that are linked with satellites, the second you hit the ground it alerts FAA and Search and Rescue teams will be dispatched.  If you're in Alaska it may be a little while until they get there, but trust me, they WILL come.  Plus there is food, water and emergency survival supplies that will last until the SAR teams arrive.<br /><br />Also you're telling me that this guy who is a professional sharp-shooter and knows everything there is about his rifle, picks up his rifle, sees that the stock is broken and comes to the conclusion that the rifle is destroyed and throws it away?  Seriously?  The gun itself still works fine, it's just going to be a lot harder to aim, it'll still fire and you can still use it to defend yourself.<br /><br />On top of that, please do NOT do what they did in this movie and try to make \\"boomsticks\\" with shotgun shells and think they'll fire normally.  Outside of a shotgun if they detonate they'll just explode.<br /><br />The entire time Liam is wandering around the Alaskan wasteland, this letter to his, wife/girlfriend is something he pulls out and looks at once in a while is always fine.  The ink that is written on the paper never runs, even AFTER he plunges into a river, it's still perfectly legible.  Plus when they guy gets his foot stuck in the rocks under the water and he's drowning, why doesn't he just yank his foot out of his boot?  On top of that, if Liam really fell into a freezing river in Alaska, he would die from hypothermia in like 15 minutes, yet according to Hollywood he's just fine.<br /><br />Oh and F.Y.I. wolves do NOT attack people!  They are scared of people and they are scared of fire, even in packs they will run from people.  Bears on the other hand... well let's just say that they're a little more aggressive.  But the wolves are the main thing about this movie that I did like, they looked really cool.<br /><br />The ending was kinda lame where they cut to black before we can see who wins the fight.  Oh if you wait until the end you see that Liam is laying on the corpse of the alpha male wolf, but neither of them are moving so I assume that means they killed each other.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />So in the end the story was pretty lame, but the wolves looked awesome.

1401207529|5.0|Hello fellow Batman fans,<br /><br />This is a short and sweet story about the origin of one of the most popular heroes in all history. Batman is my favorite comic by far. To tell you a bit about myself and my experience. I've read The Black Mirror, Dark Knight Returns, Dark Victory, Long Halloween, The Killing Joke, Knightfall Vol. 1-3, No Man's Land Vol. 1-2, and Joker. I've also grown up with the animated series and the movies. This was the very first Batman story I read, but I was waiting to read more before I gave my opinion. Now that I've gotten some more stories under my belt, I get the feel of the character and spirit of Batman. This is the perfect starting point for a beginner looking to get into the world of Batman. Batman is fresh off his trip around the world to train for this whole Batman gig. He's becoming impatient, and he's rushed. It his rush, he gets into a few trial scuffles. He's really rough on himself, and you can see the roots of Batman's nature to want to be prepared for anything at a moment's notice.<br /><br />This is a really bottom of the bargain bin trade. Fibrous matte paper, and an easily bendable, mareable and easy to warp cover. The art shows a little faded, but it's passable. It's a great bargain. $9 for a great story every Batman fan should read.<br /><br />Writing is very good, but the artwork is aging rather poorly. That is to be expected with such an old book. For the time the art was amazing. Miller's writing is awesome as always. He puts together a great action scene and can really carry across a mood of inner conflict and struggle.<br /><br />Basically, if you're reading this, you're looking to get into Batman. This is where you start. Buy this and you will be pleased.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I was so dissappointed when I listened to this on my first round.  I made myself put it back in the cd player and once I did, it really started growing on me.  It is very unlike her other albums but it has a great rythem and lyrics that Norah usually puts out.  She has grown as an artist and changed it up a bit.
1401232590|5.0|Hi There comic book fans,<br /><br />This is one of the single most iconic Batman stories of all time. The origin story of Two-Face rendered supurbly by Jeph Loeb and Time Sale! First, let me tell you. This was one of the first Batman books I read. I started out reading close to six months ago. Given the weight of this story, and others among the firsts to be picked of the web's shelf, I elected to hold off on reviewing this one for a while. I've now read The Black Mirror, Dark Knight Returns, Dark Victory, Long Halloween, The Killing Joke, Knightfall Vol. 1-3, No Man's Land Vol. 1-2, Year One, and Joker. I also have past experience with Batman from growing up on the animated series, watching the films, and the direct to DVD animated features. So now that I have a more complete knowledge of the character in the books, I plan on slowly reviewing my way through the list above, along with some of the other series' I've read. This was a great beginner read, assuming you know the origin story already, and some of the characters that go along with it. It features a ton of villains, but it hardly ever focus' on the one's it doesn't give a bit of backstory on. For a real Batman origin story, read Year One, but assuming you haven't been living in a cave (Haha, funny right?) you'll be able to pick this up and understand just fine. This story focus' on the emotional journey both Batman and Bruce Wayne take as they watch events unfold, leading to the metamorphosis of Friend and Ally  Harvey Dent into the schizophrenic enemy Two-Face.<br /><br />This is kind of an odd paperback collection of the famous holiday event. It has a strange material which composes the cover. It's a waxy, or rubbery cover. DC's print quality is good. There is no random ink bleed, and the stock is glossy. The paper has a decent weight to it, so you won't feel like you're going to rip it turning the pages. I used to be a trade paper kind of guy, so I have a lot of cheap paperbacks in my collection, but I've recently gotten more into hardcover collections. This is the only Batman book I'd like to trade up for the Absolute Edition.<br /><br />Writing and art style are very good. Art by Sale always catches my eye. I love the writing for Batman by Loeb. You can see how this is the Batman who inspired Christopher Nolan's character for the films. He has a lot of one-liners jumping out of the shadows, and you can see the relationships with some of his friends and enemies are... interesting.<br /><br />I'm in love with this book. It is a must read for anyone. For longtime Batman fans, and fairly fresh readers as well. Buy this, and you won't regret it.ve recently gotten more into hardcover collections.

B004259BMM|4.0|I have always like Keith, thought he was just okay.  This album was my first purchase of his and I love it.  I had the chance to meet him back in 2007 and he was great live but I never invested in an album. I would say this has the most songs that I have liked of his so far.  I may even go back and buy the rest of his catalog beacuse I do like this one.  I have had it on repeat for days.

You have to select each contact that you want  to print I think it needs  a select all button.  Otherwise it prints beautifully. I'm using the MFC490cw printer by Brother. My cell phone is android 2.3.<br /><br />I also can't print PDF documents, it comes out all blurry and unreadable. They should fix this before I would buy it again.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|I bought this C.D. with reservations because some the recent incognito C.D.'s have not matched the quality of some of their earlier C.D,'s. Boy was I surprised. This is one of the best works from bluey and the crew. Don't wanna know,restless as we are,above the night, are stand out tracks but there is not a week track on the whole C.D..Bluey has a knack for intoducing the industry to stand out vocalist and he does that here with Mo Brandis and Vanessa williams who stands out more on this record than she has on past C.D.'s. if you are a fan of this group you do not want to miss this one.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" falls within that emerging subcategory of popular books that appeal to 40-somethings as well as teens. There is the gamer aspect of the story that will appeal to today's teens who relate well with the virtual reality twist on the story line. Then there is the 80's trivia weaving throughout the entire book. If you didn't grow up in the 80's, you're going to need ready access to Google and Wikipedia to understand many of the references in the plot.<br /><br />But in boning up on 80's pop culture in order to stay with the story, readers are going to be paralleling the book's protagonist, who has devoted his entire young life to knowing all things 1980.<br /><br />It's a fun read.

B005FITIK0|3.0|Charlize Theron turns in her usual stellar performance in this dark and quriky drama from the people that brought you Juno, though it is quite different from Juno.  This is not a comedy so don't expect it to be funny.  Charlize portrays a successful writer of young adult novels.  But she is very messed up mentally - she is an adult but is very immature, a young adult.  She lives alone, has a habit of pulling her hair out, drinks herself to sleep every night, and has one night stands with men she barely knows.  When she receives an email birth announcement from her ex-boyfriend , who is now married, she decides on a whim to go back to her small hometown, naively thinking she can win him back.  She misinterpret's her ex-boyfriend's interest in catching up with her, imagining somehow that he will divorce his wife and that they will resume where they left off, as if they were characters in one of her novels.  However, a heavy dose of reality rudely shatters her dreams, making her realize just how unfufilled her life is.  Unfortunately, the ending seems hurried and less than satisfactory.  Overall, it is a film worth watching; just don't expect it to be funny.

0439023491|4.0|Summary<br />After the Hunger Games, Katniss is home with her family awaiting the start of the Victory Tour.  Life should be great; she and Peeta are celebrities as 1st time double victors of the games, and their families have plenty of food to eat and money to spend as does Haymitch, their mentor.  But, Katniss must continue the facade of loving Peeta so much that their almost Romeo and Juliet type ending to the games was because of temporary lovesick insanity rather than a rebellious act.  This situation doesn't suit well with Gale or Katniss or for that matter, Peeta.  Katniss thinks they've pulled it off until President Snow visits her home and tells her that she will pay for inciting unrest...and she will pay dearly.  Katniss desperately vows to do what she can to change the mindset of the people in the other Districts in order to keep her family alive.<br />The Victory Tour doesn't turn out quite like Katniss hoped, and unrest is fueled rather than squenched.  Even an honest, emotional, unplanned act by Peeta does not convince President Snow that Katniss is a law abiding citizen of the Capitol.  Using the 2nd Quarter Quell (50 years of the games) as his cover, President Snow announces the new rules of the games, and Katniss's punishments begin.<br /><br />What I Liked<br />Peeta - yep, Peeta.  I was a Gale girl in book #1, but I changed my mind in book #2.  Peeta loves Katniss unconditionally...he's even willing to give his life for hers, accepting that she may never return his love.  Peeta also seems to have a little more of a realistic eye...he sees the big picture, the future, what's best for all instead of just what's best (or what he wants) for himself.<br />Cinna and his costumes - I'm constantly wondering what he'll come up with next.  When the wedding dress costume is unveiled for what it really is, I was immediately overcome with grief bc I knew without a doubt what message was being sent by whom and what the consequences would be.  My firstborn told me she was sobbing when these particular consequences were carried out.  I was blown away but not shocked at the same time.  I felt a growing sense of acquiescence as the story went on...but I think that's what the author had in mind.<br />Katniss's mom and her healing touch.  I didn't have much sympathy for this character in book #1...I wanted her to get up and go on with her life.  Well, she has.  I love the way she morphs into her zone when wounded appear...her intelligence, her ability to make what's necessary out of whatever supplies she has and  her natural surroundings, her level headedness...these are characteristics of her that, in fact, the reader only sees when she's using her healing gifts.<br />Mags - oh Mags.  I love you.  When I'm an old grandma person, I want to be like you.  Kisses. That's all.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br />Katniss - I can't believe I'm saying this, but GOSH, she started getting on my nerves.  What a whiner.  Yes, I know she's only 17, but really??<br />The violence - the level of violence is ratcheted up in Catching Fire, but not in a glorified way.  I think the reader needs to see the intensity of the situation to feel the helplessness that any of these characters must be experiencing as they all prepare to offer their lives in order for others to live.<br />President Snow - duh, right?  I swear he reminds me of Hitler.  The evil, the violence, the evil, the hate, the shock, the evil...have I mentioned the evil?<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br />If you've read the first one, go ahead and read this one.  I was expecting a more negative reaction from myself because of what others have told me and almost didn't read this one.  I'm glad I did.me she was sobbing when these particular consequences were carried out.  I was blown away but not shocked at the same time.

I think the reader needs to see the intensity of the situation to feel the helplessness that any of these characters must be experiencing as they all prepare to offer their lives in order for others to live.<br />President Snow - duh, right?  I swear he reminds me of Hitler.  The evil, the violence, the evil, the hate, the shock, the evil...have I mentioned the evil?<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br />If you've read the first one, go ahead and read this one.  I was expecting a more negative reaction from myself because of what others have told me and almost didn't read this one.  I'm glad I did.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Sanderson's prose. His dialogs are  a little unrealistic and his writing style is inconsistant. But even with all this, this book is probably the best book i have read in the recent 2-3 years. absolutely engaging and amzingly well put together. I was totally floored by it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|cool game I really enjoy playing when I'm bored at work or something. would recommend. it my kids really like to play it also.  I cant wait for the next movie to come out. I like the name. and sounds of all the animals
B00846TTDG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Some reviewers talk about bad acting but considering that these guys are military and not professional actors, the acting is decent.  The action, intensity and overall movie are not about talking but about doing and that part is done exceptionally well.
B00846REIS|5.0|Although different from Fifty Shades, this book is the closest I've came across to resemble.  Very steamy and hot!  Great book...can't wait for the next one.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|I didn't like this one, the filming looked really cheap, like a second-hand C-rated movie.  The first Ghostrider had enough action to showcase Ghostrider, but in this movie, it just wasn't the same.  This movie didn't seem as menacing, and kind of tame, with weak flames.  I didn't like it at all.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Totally not what was expected-Do NOT enjoy smut-porn. Preview not descriptive enough regarding content, or I was too naive to see it. Too graphic-too over the top. Total waste of $10. Stopped reading & deleted!!  Will not trust previews again.<br />Would like to have known Master/sub--ahead of time--glad I did not buy the trilogy.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I missed out on the theatrical experience with this film, and I really hate I missed it.  On the big screen this movie would have been even better than the BR version.  And the BluRay version was spectacular, clean crisp visual unlike I've seen on other BR movies.  I vaugely knew what to expect before seeing the movie.  But with a 7 year old little girl who acts like the Disney Channel some type of addictive drug(no kidding, we also think it's affecting her personality for the worse), we've seen commercials, trailers, behind the scenes, parts of the movie and everything else thrown at us from the Disney Channel about this movie over the past 7-8 months.  If you don't watch the Disney Channel, you missed where the core marketing's focus audience is/was.  It was a great movie.  I am a big fan of everything SciFi, and this movie was great in it's own right.  I'll admit many plots points or some visuals seemed somewhat \\"seen that before\\" feel to it, but that's the point right?  The original writer's imagination from 1917 helped expand the sci fi imagination of others for a domino effect for us to enjoy so many other space operas, wars and epic battles are now classic in their own right.  We rented the BluRay of this, but I'm gonig to have to buy this one.  It's a keeper.  My wife enjoyed it. my kids enjoyed. I enjoyed it.  A good 'clean' space adventure romp to Mars and back we'll want to experience again and again.  Though with the Goddess, and few details reminded me just a little of Dave Duncan's \\"The Seventh Swordman\\" trilogy, but then again... that book didn't come first.  And if you haven't read the book (like I have not yet), it will get you interested and want to read the book (The \\"Princess of Mars\\" novel of course)!  Very underrated movie, that should have at least broke even with it's huge budget but grossing in at $179 million isn't bad either, just the budget was so... much higher than that.  Yes, Virginia... there is a Mars.  (Somebody had to do it...)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game ever like it is good for a kindle fire you should get this game.
0307951529|5.0|Hello,<br />This was the best book when after countless interviews and promises of employment, nothing was coming through.  I am 20% of the way there, putting fear aside and pressing forward.  Chris gives a very clear and direct way to start a business today, get paid tomorrow.  That is what you need - a way to look at what you can do, start it and follow through.  No other book on entrepreneurship is that directed, that practical and can help you start earning money tomorrow.  Don't wait, read it today and take action tomorrow.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i have played it on my friends ipos and it was ok but when i got it on my kindle  it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit that I had just about had it with inexpensive self-published novels.  Frankly, for most that I've read, $0.99 was highway robbery.  Their needlessly flowery prose, horrible grammatical and spelling errors (get an EDITOR, please!) and too-thin stories made me almost want to praise big publishing houses.  (Almost)<br /><br />And then I read Wool.<br /><br />Drawn in from the outset, it didn't take long for me to realize what a great deal I'd received.  There were multiple story lines that expertly intertwined and yet stayed separate enough to develop in surprising ways.  I suspect there's not much more I can add to the trillion or so 5 star reviews on Amazon, but to just recommend the book mightily.<br /><br />One final thought, lest you think intertwining story lines means the whole book is too high brow.  There were some top-knotch thriller scenes with words ripping by like bullets.  One scene in particular, where a character is lost and disoriented in complete darkness, would make Stephen King need Ambien.<br /><br />I had a good time reading this. You will too.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this game is so fun it looks nothing from the cover but once u perchuse it it is the rummest thing you have ever played I love it!!!:]
0439023513|4.0|I was a little nervous about the last book in the Hunger Games series. Many people that I talked to thought it - and book two - were not as strong as the first. On the contrary, I thought the third was quite good. The second felt like an incomplete story; it, combined with the third, bring everything to a quite satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />One thing that I really admired was Suzanne Collins' ability to drop a really nice cliffhanger at the end of her chapters. Not necessarily all of her chapters end that way, but there were enough of them that I simply could not put the book down. I read the entire last third of the book in one sitting, even though it was 2 AM by the time I finished. Very well-written, and some surprisingly (to me) clever plot devices used in the story.<br /><br />I am so happy to have read this series; it was a well-written story that was quite engaging, despite the Young Adult label. There's nothing really young adult about young adults killing each other, but it was a pleasure to read.
0385040253|5.0|It's THE book to have on any knot enthusiast's shelf. It's the reference to the references. Historically important and a reference you will turn to again and again.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This was one of the first apps that I installed on my Fire and I would play it all the time. Unfortunately,  the ads have now taken over the app with full length video commercials. I uninstalled it last night and found another app that is a pleasure to play. Such a shame.
B004KA9UXO|4.0|Reaaly Great I felt I was there most of the time Characters strong and believable and plot well thought out
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Very good books to read !  I don't usually like to read but theses book were very well written and kept u in suspense until the last page
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Read the book non stop all in one sitting. Not to say that it's short, it was just that good. Rarely do I ever get that hooked by a book, but this one definitely had me. A must read!
0439023491|4.0|Book two in the Hunger Games trilogy is a fine follow-up, picking up shortly after the conclusion of the first book. It is less of a complete story, though. It certainly stops at a logical point, but has no sense of conclusion so that the book could stand on its own. This is a particular pet peeve of mine; in my opinion, books in a series should stand on their own as complete stories.<br /><br />The story itself is well-told and very engaging. At times I had a hard time putting the book down at night. I'm sure I would have finished it much quicker if not for the other demands for my time. I'm looking forward to wrapping up the series with the third book next.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game! super addicting! if you are going to play it make sure that you have plenty of time.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First of all this movie was amazing. As were all of the individual movies that led to this amazing blockbuster. Being a DC fan I have to wonder whats in the works for the counter effective. Im absolutely positive that the Dark Knight Rises will live up to everything it's expected to and more. Furthermore, with the release of Man of Steel hopefully next year, DC is ultimately making a run for a Justice League movie equal, if not better, than it's Marvel rival. Either way the future is going to be exciting at both ends of the fence. That said, this movie is a must see, and the Blu Ray or DVD will be a must have if you are a true superhero fan of any kind!!
B0086700CM|5.0|im very addicted to this game. it is difficult  and fun at the same time!!! the monkey things were very aqward to think about. the graficks were amazing thow.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This is honestly one of the greatest books I have ever experienced. A story about love and the human condition, it will have you laughing through tears. If you are looking for the next modern classic I strongly suggest you pick this up.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Saw a preview on TV one day and had to wait about 4 months for it to come to the theater.  Well worth the wait, I can say.<br />Everybody is offering their review, and thankfully, most are positive.  However, there was one particular scene that just had me.  It's when George, realizing his fame and fortune are near an end, and he is sitting in his living room looking out the window, and it's raining.  The camera angle has his face, and the raindrops that are falling down from the windows reflect on his face, and it looks as though he is crying.  Incredible!  This is what great filmmaking is all about.  I thought the acting was superb, and even the extras in the film were terrific.  When the dog has to run to the cop for help, notice the lady standing on the corner.  She reminds me of everybody's aunt, and she has that \\"look\\" about her that was just terrific.  Go see this wonderful film, and I, for one, cannot wait until it arrives at my home in a few weeks.  I will watch it over and over, because it's one of those rare, excellent films that allow you to savor them again and again.
0439023521|4.0|Once again, I find myself completely enamored with a Young Adult novel. It seems that anything that doesn't have sex in it qualifies as a YA novel, I guess. This one sure had enough violence to make me wonder what the YA label really is for.<br /><br />At any rate, I found this book captivating and nearly impossible to put down. I breezed through it fairly quickly, and was pleased with the writing style, plot and associated twists. I eagerly await running out to see the movie adaptation. And shortly after that, I'll be diving into the next book in the series.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its ok<br />but you don't really travel. and its kind of confusing. and you have to use your own money
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found the omnibus of \\"Wool\\" totally engrossing (and I normally do not care for sci-fi material)!  I am very anxious to read the continuing saga and learn more of the history of the silo and it's inhabitants.  We may just get a hint at the possible direction that our world is heading towards. I highly recommend this book series!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Ok.We all know what a zombie is…or we think we do.If you have not red this book you have NO chance of surviving a zombie apocolypse.This book teaches you all you need to know in order to survive(shelter,equiptment,weapons,armour)<br />If you believe that the world is going to end this year…then buy this book.I am also working on a video about this subject on YouTube:1999bluestar.Keep on the look-out for my other reviews.(p.s. It is worth 10.00.)
B00571F26Y|2.0|I purchased the book and followed it for two weeks. There was no noticable difference in my waist size, and I never lost the craving for bread products.  I lost about a pound, which was much less than following the Atkins diet. The only way to get rid of the \\"wheat-belly\\" is to excercise it away. Period.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is great fun.  It is exactly what we were looking for, and my 2 year old loves it.  I am completely satisfied!  It seems well made, it's a good size for several children (even for Mommy, too), and it's adorable.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I had only seen Psycho once before making this purchase, but have been a huge Hitchcock fan ever since seeing Vertigo some years ago. I loved the film on first viewing and was blown away by it despite knowing the general plotline. This being the second time I'd seen the film, and the first time remastered on BluRay, I was once again absolutely floored by it. The picture quality gives it added depth, and I was absolutely transported. I'm currently checking out the special features and definitely recommend checking out The Making of Psycho that's included. This is an iconic masterpiece that's almost a necessity to own on BluRay for any fans of Hitch or film in general. Now, we just need Rear Window and Vertigo to be released.
0439023513|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS:<br />I feel this book tells a tragic tale of a fallen heroine who realizes that there is a high price for freedom in love and war. Suzanne Collins sends this message:  Are we ever truly free or at peace, since truly there will always be a ruling figure or government?  There are so many dark social issues that the first book alluded to that I found book 3 to be appropriately unsettling: the outcomes of war, PTSD and other mental disorders linked to traumatic events, socialism, commercialism, propaganda through television, idolization of celebrities, etc.  This trilogy reminded me in some ways of the premise for \\"American Psycho\\" starring Christian Bale.  It's a different story but also offers a satirical interpretation of our materialist impulsive driven society. The dark undertones were present throughout the series in all the characters, even Peeta.  A growing distance between Gale and Katniss was imminent.  Gale explains to Katniss in book 3 that he wished he took Peeta's place to care for Katniss but he knew he had a responsibility to care for her family during her absence.  In Book 2, he announced his purpose to start a rebellion while Katniss continued to be a pawn for the Capitol in the Quarter Quells. Peeta on the other hand, having all good human characteristics, eventually is broken down through the atrocities of war and never recovers. He symbolizes justice and truth and when he is broken down, Katniss weakens and struggles with her own truths.  Social morale tests these characters' convictions.  History has shown how social norms change and adapt to culture, moral issues change with social changes and continues to shape the future of society (i.e. Civil Rights Moevement, slavery abolition, abortion, gay rights, etc.) Peeta and Katniss' facade became their reality once they realized they had to adapt and move on with life. She was struggling to fight the system all along, both the Capitol and the Rebels (both dystopian societies), but fighting it alone in the end once the war was over.  This reminds me of what happened during 9/11.  People completely forgot about the victims, it was glorified on tv and still is, but the victims still suffer and many are long forgotten.  It's like most wars really (especially Vietnam).  The 3rd book touched a lot of social issues that reflect the problems with today's societies.<br />This quote was quite poignant to me in Book 3:<br /><br />'\\"Are we preparing for another war, Plutarch?'\\" I ask.<br />'\\"Oh, not now. Now we're in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated,\\" he says.  \\"But collective thinking is usually short-lived.  We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.  Although who knows?  Maybe this will be it, Katniss.\\"\\"<br /><br />After this quote, Plutarch, the game keeper, changes the subject abruptly to continue planning a singing program for Katniss as if that has more significance.<br /><br />There are other wonderful quotes in this book that show a deeper underlying message.  To those who only enjoyed Book 1 and 2, do you think that you may be as guilty as the Capitol citizens for being entertained by children fighting to the death in the Hunger Games?  Are we not doing that today in our society too by buying into media portrayals of celebrities, current events and tragedies? I think Collins wants to show that the citizens are as much as fault, both those in support and those opposing government, as those in power in perpetuating social injustices and norms; that it comes at a high moral price. No matter how strong, we are all vulnerable and fallible when faced with death and trauma.  Just something to think about...
0812993292|4.0|Since so many others have already reviewed this book, just let me say...<br /><br />I admit that I am always a bit skeptical when books are compared to other books that I loved, but I often can't resist reading them to see if the claim holds true. In this case I'm happy to say that it does. Major Pettigrew and Harold are both very good books.<br /><br />Harold, however, has his own charm and personality as he should. His character is extremely well developed as you read about his journey. I found the writing to be solid and well done. It's easy to read and I found it to be heartwarming.<br /><br />Overall, a good novel that I felt was nicely done and left me satisfied when I was finished. I will certainly be on the lookout for more books by this author.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|&quot;wow&quot; is all I can say its awesome I say<br />I love it works great on kindle fire get it now
B005DVJQHY|5.0|I am a book buff so this was an interesting read! The book was very informative in the information that I was seeking . I would recommend it to anyone!
B0067TGSOK|3.0|Sure, the book contained some inspiring stories about how other people had created their businesses. Guillebeau stays on the surface, though, and writes very generically. There's little depth or specificity to this book, just a lot of encouraging words of which you can get more from other books. It's also pretty poorly written in terms of grammar and prose.<br /><br />I reckon [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated)]] is a more specific, more inspiring, more helpful and more well-written book.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Cannot wait to get book 2, Christan in a very naughty boy - rich naughty boy. The book held me in from front to back, just could not put it down, exceptional reading.
0307719774|5.0|This book is so much fun to fill out and it will be interesting to see how my answers change over the years. I really like the questions. They are fun to answer and seem like they would be applicable to everyone. A lot of Q & A journals I've seen have questions that are too specific and would only apply to a certain kind of person. This one is not like that at all. Here is a sample of some of the questions:<br /><br />Something that made you worry today____<br />What's your favorite gadget?<br />What makes you cynical?<br />The best hour of today was____. Why?<br />Write the first sentence of your autobiography.<br />Who do you want to know better?<br />When was the last time you spoke to your parents?<br />What is your resolution for tomorrow?<br />What details from today would you like to remember?<br /><br />There are 365 questions, one for each day of the year. So you answer one question a day for a year. Then at the start of the next year you go back to the beginning and answer all the questions again. There is room to keep doing this for 5 years. Once you finish this journal you will have 5 answers to each of the 365 questions and a wonderful portrait of how you've changed and/or stayed the same over the years.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this eBook to upload my first self-published book to Amazon. I love how short and easy-to-understand this guide is. Even if you're a technophobe, this guide will get you through without breaking a sweat (especially the Table of Contents part, which is completely different (and better) than how Smashwords requires it). Kudos to Amazon for setting the bar and continuing to be the most author-friendly place around.

However, if you are looking for a boost of inspiration, a chockfull of ideas and action prompts and a ton of real life stories of real people who made their dream business come true, most with almost no seed money - then this is definitely the book for you!
1936608898|5.0|Just enough \\"science-y stuff\\" to explain how and why their methods work and not so much that you need a dictionary to get through the book. Full of their charming wit, factual information, and real life reviews of how this has truly changed peoples' lives; all written in a manner that truly inspires you to give it a try... Seriously, what do you have to lose; pain, inflammation, digestive problems, autoimmune diseases?<br />To my delight there was even a section for the \\"what if\\" people or what they call the special population; what if I am Vegan or what if I am pregnant (because I am)? Dallas and Melissa truly have us set up for long term success with their program and this book!
0805017445|5.0|What can I say about this Chidlren's classic. Just LOVE IT!!!  Eric Carle is such an creative illustrator and children of all ages enjoy reading this book over and over.

B005BUZJ6O|5.0|After watching their YouTube video in February, I bought this right away! It's my favorite music tracks of all time! I even bought the CD. I listen to this at least 3 times a week. I can't be long without it. 2 Cellos compositions of rock songs into Cello music is magical! You can feel and hear the passion they put into their work. You don't always have to have lyrics in a song to appreciate the beauty of melody. I hope they come out with a Christmas CD in the future!

0439023513|3.0|^ SPOILERS ^<br /><br />I loved the first two books in this trilogy, but the MockingJay conclusion was disappointing for many reasons.<br /><br />1. Katniss:  The author changed the major character of the book without any hints of what was coming in parts 1 and 2.  It's as if you read a book about Superman and wind up with Clark Kent, only MockingJay  was worse because at least you always knew Clark was Superman's alter ego and Clark also had some gumption. Here, a strong and resourceful Katniss winds up physically and mentally beaten down.  Not only was she unappealing, but there was no foreshadowing of what she was to turn into.<br /><br />2. Deaths:  Many main characters die. OK. But should Prim be killed off in one paragraph.  Should other main characters be disposed of so quickly.  It was ineffective and gave the impression of not being well thought out.<br /><br />3.  The plot:  I actually liked the theme that some of the rebels, especially Coin, mirrored the evils in the Capitol. But I found the end of this plot theme to be murky. Coin's dead, so all of a sudden, everything gets better. How?  It was not particularly believable or developed.  What happens after the revolution is also glossed over in an unsatisfying way.<br /><br />4.  Peeta: This attractive major character is mostly nonexistent in MockingJay.  His mind is so altered that he becomes another person and the person he turns into is not a very strong foil for Katniss.<br /><br />5. Katniss's mother:  She is quickly disposed of at the end without any exploration of her relationship to Katniss.  Unconvincing and unsatisfying.<br /><br />6. Pace of the book:  MockingJay was simply not as fast moving or engrossing as the first two books. It wasn't bad.  I kept wanting to find out what was going to happen, but, especially in parts, it dragged a little.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 3 stars because it did interest me and in many places it was imaginative and original.  It could, though, have been so much better.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Mockingjay was the final book in The Hunger Games Trilogy and was just as enjoyable as the first two books.  The author kept me intrigued all the way through this book and the end came too quickly.  Highly recommend the final book and I felt that the description of Katniss' life throughout the three books kept you intrigued to see how much more this young girl could handle.  The Hunger Games trilogy - the best three books I have read for some time and I recommend this book highly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is an excellent bird's eye view of a complicated interpersonal relationship. The emotional ups and downs take the reader on a thrilling ride through the lives of Ana and Christian, first purely sexual and then developing into a close, emotional bond. I would highly recommend this book. I am a few chapters into book #2 of the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this was a great book. it did not have a \\"fake ending\\" with a letdown. both characters were flawed and neither likeable. this author has yet to let me down. if you like her other books, you will like this one. I am from the midwest, this area as well, so I enjoy her books.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I didn't went to see it in the movies because the critics review, what a big mistake, I enjoyed a lot. I can see how this story inspired so many people to write a version of their own.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Very good movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Mark Walberg has always been a great actor to me so to see him in a very intense drama was a plus!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I wanted to say waste of money in the title but I think it was free so I put in waste of time. My kindle fire opens all PDF documents and there is no need for this software. I have deleted it from my device.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Catching Fire is a great follow-up to The Hunger Games and a thoroughly good read.  I could not wait to download the book and follow the story line further.  I found the Catching Fire so enticing that I could not wait to read it each evening.  The author maintained the suspense throughout the book and it was hard to turn my Kindle off each night.  A wonderful book that I would thoroughly recommend and make sure you follow up with \\"Mockingjay\\" to complete the series.  I look forward to more books from this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game was awsome, I play it every day. One of the most addicting games ever!!!!!!! every one should have this game and if u dont........ get it NOW
0099579936|1.0|read the first book and half of the second, - nothing but a modern Harlequin Romance - no story line or plot - just a repetitious, redundant, overuse of sex . . . really??  - try and be more original than this - the book is designed to sell a movie - which I supppose it will, sadly enough.  One of the worst books/series I have ever read and have no idea why it is getting some 4-5 star reviews . . .
B00001OH7Y|5.0|My record in this sleepless night is Scary Monsters by David Bowie. After the Berlin trilogy, the Thin White Duke is back with an album where there's a bit 'of everything from Japanese culture, to science-fiction in the 50s Moebius. It's no game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy the features of this app. Things such as multiple translations, search, highlighting, reading plans and more. Very easy to share with social sites as well. They update often to keep it fresh and user friendly. No complaints!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was extremely hot!! It was definely a page turner..I can not wait for the second one to come out!! I am patiently waiting for more...fabulous book you won't be disappointed!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was written at a 3rd grade level at best with no character development and a story line that repeated itself at least twice in every chapter.  Save your money, this book isn't worth your time.

B00000K31Q|5.0|This was a great movie all around. It's a well-done modernization of a Shakespeare play. Good entertainment and something I could share with my teenage daughter. She enjoyed it, while still learning posititve lessons. Wish there were more like this one.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This is not a candy coated story about a preacher.  In fact, he tells more about his past than you may want to know.  What is important is the work he continues to do in the Sudan to save as many children as possible.  With his own funds, he built orphanages and met the needs of children, including protecting them from those who would make slaves of them.  His mission is in a war zone.  Who knows what we might do in his place?  Most of us will never know.  Few Americans bother to donate to such causes, much less put their lives and incomes on the line to help victims in another country.  Sam Childers is an unusual person.  God showed him a need and to this day helps him meet it.  An amazing story of how God can use anyone.
1905236042|5.0|I'm a Special Ed teacher and learned about these yoga cards in a training class for my students.  I LOVE them!!  My students learn best in a visual and kinestic way and these are perfect for us to work on poses, getting their concentration and so much more!  During the training I was taught to use these in a story setting - hand 3-4 cards to 3-4 students.  They must figure out the poses and make a simple story with them.  It helps with the thought process, social skills and presentation skills! I'll be using this next school year with my students and very excited about finding so many more uses for them!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|We read this book for my book group.  The story was good and quite interesting but to be honest I felt it somewhat tedious to read as it went on.  The main character has amnesia so we have to relive the same sorts of things with her over and over.  Although it made it's point, it started to grate on me about 1/2 way through and I couldn't wait to finish it so that I did not have to live this woman's life over and over again.  I also felt that the ending left us hanging and was somewhat unresolved even though the mystery was solved.  In the end, it made for a good book club discussion, where everyone somewhat liked it a and I have heard it is being made into a movie, which I think will be very good, since I think the story would translate better on film than having to read the same things over and over.
B0083GP1P2|5.0|A great way to see an episode you missed or purchase some episodes you would like to keep. The video worked great I was able to watch the show at my convenience. I really liked being able to get the show quickly and best of all no commercials and reasonably priced.
B007YOC4RW|1.0|Okay, I get it (sort of).  I see lots of rave reviews here... for the album I just listened to each and every snipet of, available here on Amazon.  I suppose I'm a tad annoyed because fellow fans of the Blues have recommended Joe B. to me in the past, and I've paid the going legal rate for a couple of the mp3 files they suggested.  I've listened to them in the car, I've listened to them on a boat... I just don't \\"feel\\" it like I do the musicians Joe B. has been compared to that I love and listen to over and over.  I can put on anything by Tom Waits or Ry Cooder, or Taj Mahal, any time, day or night, and feel the passion, the pain, the soulfullness.  For some reason Joe B. just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />So, in addition to making a public pronouncement here and now that I have no intention to purchase any tracks from Joe B's latest album anytime in the near future, I would like to make a public pronouncement to any of my true Blues friends who may read this, that as much as I've tried to listen, feel, and truly dig Joe B, he just doesn't do it for me.  Sorry.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Pretty awesome little device.  FM reception is excellent! Using the Aux is even better!  I am an IT Manager, I just put a bunch of music on a flash drive, plug it in in and I am singing away!
B00881VLCE|5.0|loving the ability to load new puzzles and choose options. nice app that grows with you over time. kudos to the creators
B003EI2EH2|2.0|I enjoyed 4-hour work week fine, though when you really boiled it down, it was a fantasy mixed with a few and I mean a few helpful time saving tips. In this book, Ferris is much more sprawling. He can still be minorly entertaining, but ultimately the book barely delivers on giving you good information. Often I couldn't follow Ferris or if I did, it wasn't clear if it was BS or just \\"who cares.\\" The guy is obsessive about his looks and many superficial matters. Ultimately, it made me feel sad for him, but perhaps he'll grow out of it. Give him A+ for being a brillian marketer.
B007P6VM04|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this CD.  I enjoyed the TV series and loved the music.  Both actresses in the series have great voices.  I like having all the music from the show but am disappointed that 2 songs were omitted from the CD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very challenging game love it something I can play that will keep me busy. my kids love it keep them busy also
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|When I first downloaded this app, I was overwhelmed by how complex it is and how many options I had. if you're feeling that way, I highly suggest you stick it out -- I did, and I don't regret it. I love the tags feature which allows me to find all notes with the same topics, and the link to website and a add photo abilities are just a couple more that I find useful. Above all, I love that I can get my notes on my computer, kindle, and phone without having to do any hard work transferring them. Awesome app worth the time to get to know.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for temple run to come to the kindle fire! It's highly addictive and very challenging! I love it!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I'm surprised by so many poor reviews on here.  I wasn't a huge fan of the first one initially, but it kind of grew on me.  Our whole family thought this one was more entertaining than the first & was in the 4-5 star range (I rounded up).  I can understand how it may not be everyone's cup of tea.  It's certainly original in style compared to most other big budget films out.  Most who liked the first Sherlock will enjoy this one also.
B0086700CM|4.0|I got this game and it worked great but then I had to uninstall it. now it wont download from my cloud. it says &quot;open&quot; but nothing happens. don't uninstall its a one time deal

B008764ZQ4|5.0|I went to see the movie and was simply blown away by the talent. First, Tom Cruise can sing and sing rock! His range is amazing. If you are into rock this movie is a must. The soundtrack is just as perfect. No spoilers, but I Can't Fight This Feeling between Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand=hilarious. Will see the movie again.
1451627289|5.0|Who says you can't write a book about time travel and not have it be science fiction? Not Stephen King!<br /><br />Actually, King has dabbled in time travel before, as it played a part in his Dark Tower series. But in 11/22/63, where time travel is front and center, it's the fiction, not the science, that impresses.<br /><br />Simply put, 11/22/63 is a book full of nostalgia. Longing for a simpler time fairly drips from every page. It's a love letter to an era before computers, cell phones, the Internet, terrorism, globalism, and best-selling Stephen King novels. Of course, people who lived during those decades had their own problems. The Cold War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. Out-of-control cigarette smoking. Racism. And, oh yes, the assassination of a president.<br /><br />Readers who weren't alive during the 50s and 60s might not relate quite as strongly to the subject matter as those who lived through the events King so masterfully describes.  But even younger readers (and by \\"younger\\" I mean anyone under 50) will finish with no doubt about how Mr. King feels about those decades. And when you fall as deeply in love with mid-20th-century culture as the author and his main character, chances are you'll end up wishing you had access to a portal through time as well.<br /><br />King does a great job focusing on the story and for the most part letting the various paradoxes traditionally associated with time travel in literature alone. In this book, time travel is just assumed to be possible. Never mind how it works or why. When one character asks, \\"What if you go back and kill your grandfather?\\" Another answers, quite correctly, it seems to me, \\"Why the %&$# would you want to do a thing like that?\\" End of discussion. No endless angst over the space-time continuum. It's refreshing.<br /><br />As ever, King's prose is perhaps a tad shy of literary genius, but that's really not what he's shooting for. In this book, he's hoping to entertain, to inform, and to transport readers 50 years into the past to see \\"what might have happened if.\\" And at that, there is none better than Stephen King. Maybe he's a genius after all.<br /><br />This strong, character-driven book contains less language and sexuality than some of King's others, and despite the rather dour undercurrent of the looming assassination, the book manages not to be overly dark or hopeless. If you enjoy Stephen King books, you'll enjoy this one too. He's just too good a writer not to like his work. And if you've never read a Stephen King book before, this might be a good introduction. Highly recommended--but beware; it's long, and even when you get to the final page, you might not want it to end.ers 50 years into the past to see \\"what might have happened if.\\" And at that, there is none better than Stephen King.

B003H8WSM0|5.0|Great Album,I am glad it came with free digital copy! sounds even better on Vinyl! will definately buy more vinyl from Foals
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Sound economics presented in an easy to understand way. Shows how the different variables interact between them. A good update of John Maynard Keynes.
B006Z00M9I|4.0|Its a good movie, had a good explanation. But i was dissapointed it was missing quite a few scenes that were on the previews!!!<br />id say the 1st two movies were better than this #3. I hope #4 tops them all off :)
0646497855|3.0|If you have limited time (=less than 2 months) to take the test it may help you take the 6-7 band scores to pass the required minimum english levels that international universities want you to gain... But for more, especially academic test takers who are facing much rare words in the test need to effort more. There's also a possibility of luck because some tests are quite easy,but some test are from the outer space that if you don't have adequate vocabulary skills you can't pass the reading and it causes you to score less. This book may work effectively if you have enough time to develop your vocabulary or writing skills. You know better what are your disadvantages. You need to have more written sources to dominate english, but an effective book like target band 7 makes your route less,gives you an idea of the whole route and what you study additionaly will be your plus...

1612130283|5.0|I have to agree with so many of the reviews that are NOT positive about 50 Shades, but even knowing that going it, it was a fun read. I wanted to see for myself what all the 'talk' was about.  I don't care if the writing  meets the high standards of the classics;  I want some juicy summer reading, and this is it.  Yes there are some juvenile tendencies in the writing, but it was JUST PLAIN FUN.  I actually liked all of the main characters. And once again, if I'm going into a fantasy world why not have all the things about a guy you could possibly want, minus the Dom part.  The hair, the money, the jets, the mansion, the staff, the toys, etc. ( I got tired of Danielle Steele and her rich characters, so what is really the difference?)  And frankly, after watching all of the CSI stories and Law Order series on TV there's nothing new under the sun for us anymore,  It's all right out there.  I thought I'd be bored when I finished the first book, but I honestly want to see where this is all going, so I'm in for the trilogy.  There are some good friends who won't be told what my summer fun is, because they would be embarrassed to know that I was wrapped up in TRASHY reading.  But hey, each to his own.  I had a great time and look forward to reading the other two books.  Relax, enjoy the fun.  I really don't think this is intended to  be serious  reading or writing.
0312576463|4.0|My first Franzen and I wanted to not like it. Going in, I assumed it would be a bunch of whiny over-dramatic middle aged suburbanites. This ended up being true, though I did not anticipate that Franzen would do such a great job of making them sympathetic (even when I was completely frustrated with their actions). My favorite character was Patty, even though she was the character I most wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into. Patty was completely unlikable until her autobiographical section. From that point on, all of her actions had context and depth, and though she continued being horrible, I found myself actively cheering for her to do better. I had similar feelings toward Joey. The novel isn't moved forward by the big plot points-- saving birds or even a marriage disintegrating-- but rather on the development of these characters and seeing who they become (for better or worse) and how they strengthen and destroy each other.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I started to play this and it was almost as fun as tiger woods golf game's. I love the crazy shots it gives you and the different ball's.  I suggest the game.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Excellent background information to base on one's diet on starch. Clear and fun facts from the past, and present researches. Plenty of studies to back the claim, that we need starches to satisfy our caloric needs. I tried eating fruits only, thinking that is the best nutrition there is, high in calories to satisfy and plenty of nutrition. The trouble is, today's fruit is not ripe most of the time when picked and shipped, thus lacking in flavour, taste, and calories majorly. So my other alternative that is still very healthy and easy to maintain is starch based living. Love the sweet potato/yam, potatoes and rice daily with yellow/green veggies and some beans/lentils! I used to literally struggle to get my calories in with fruits and greens, now it's a breeze! Feeling happy and satisfied every day, now I can focus on other things too, not just my diet.<br />Thank you Dr. McDougall for making my life so simple and easy to manage!
0385737955|5.0|The maze runner was one of the best books ever! It has the adventure to last a life time. Your curiosity willl leave u hanging untill u get the next book! I was in love with it. I couldn't put the book down! Fabulous book!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Fun book, quick reading. Incredibly compelling at the start and (mostly) carries this through the whole novel. Many of the secondary characters as interesting as the protagonists, and the night circus itself is a unique creations that held my attention and curiosity. The love story is not the central piece of this story, which actually makes it more interesting for me. A book that I saw more than I read, thanks to the beauty of the writing.
B0086700CM|4.0|seems to be freezing after having a week?<br />I am not sure what the issue is. very addicting! now have it for my iphone also
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its an ok game I'm on level 14 because I get bored so I play on it but if u have little children this is a game u should get!!!!
0439023513|5.0|Loved this book. It was the last book and I felt it wrapped everything up perfectly. I'm so happy I tried these books out. Great price in comparison to book stores as well.
B004LROUW2|3.0|Fun read, definitely piqued my curiosity and imagination. But some of the sections were just too repetitive and the descriptions (especially involving sex and women's bodies-- stop complaining about your small breasts please!) really painful. But I loved the universe(s) Murakami created. Just maybe a better story (or a shorter story?) could have been placed in it(them). This was my first Murakami, so I'm excited to read another.<br /><br />My mistake with this book was taking a several month break in the middle of reading this novel. I think I would have given this 4 or 5 stars if I had read it in the space of two weeks, instead of in two chunks over several months. Granted, this was originally released in three(?) pieces so maybe I read it closer to how it was intended to be read.
B00003CXPD|2.0|the movie is great but you can barely hear the actors talking.  the music is blaring.  something had to be wrong with the dvd.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|At first, I was dissapointed with this blu ray concert. My enjoyment of a concert is seriously diminished if I can't hear the words of the songs - I'm not listening just for the noise. Some songs of this concert are sung so fast that most of the wording cannot be understood, and at other times Pink mumbles the words somewhat. I suppose it's helpful if you already know the words of the songs. I tried turning up the volume of the center channel speaker, and that helped, but I don't intend to keep changing my speaker setup every time I play a different disk. My receiver has a one button feature to turn on DSP to Rock Concert, and that's the easiest way to help clarify the songs. The more I listen, the more I hear. And I've gotten hooked on this disk. The video is good and the concert is lively and colorful. The sound may not be perfect, but the backup musicians and singers are good. The harmonies are good, especially on Ave Mary A, and every performer on stage seems to be into the performance. The energy of the performance usually results in some serious recliner dancing, both my feet are tapping on the floor and both hands are tapping out the beat on the recliner arms. Get this blu ray, tune up your sound system as good as you can, and get into some recliner dancing.
0439023483|5.0|I didn't think this would be my type of book, but it hooked me! The plot is great! In depth and moving. And the price is awesome. Significantly cheaper than book stores.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The writing is simple, the characters not well developed, and the pop culture references sometimes serve as a crutch to hold up the weak spots in the plot-- but I still couldn't put this down and was completely drawn in. This book reminded me how much I love reading (after a few months of doing is sparingly), and because of that, I have to say I really liked it, despite all the weaknesses. I've recommended this book more than any other this past year, and everyone I know who has read it has loved it.
B00863DOL0|5.0|This looks amazing. I saw preview on You Tube and Facebook.<br /> The dvds are filmed in hd and very high quality and I cannot wait to see the whole thing and best yet on Blue Ray.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome,  eroctic love story. This series is a must read, I never wanted to put the books down and I am considering reading them again.
0439023491|5.0|This book is just as good as the first. The story line continues and it gets you as addicted as the first one. I am loving these books and they are cheaper here.
0316098329|4.0|Really unique book. Came in worried it would be too intense, but author does great job of balancing the horribly depressing and disturbing with the encouraging humor and uplifting human spirit. After reading this, view news stories about these sorts of incidents in completely different light.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|If you love prog rock, like me, this is the best cd that has come out in a very long time,Just buy it!
0061478784|5.0|This is a fun book. It takes an interesting look at fairy-tales and takes the lives of step-sisters in a new direction. The book is witty and fun and clever! I didn't like was the very ending, because it just seemed to be wrapped up too quickly (but maybe I just wanted to read more). *Spoiler* There is also a part of the book that takes them out of the wonderful fantasy land the author had created and into the \\"real world\\" of Wales. Some of the magic of the book was lost for me when that happened.<br /><br />Overall, a delightful read. Lighthearted and fun spirited!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good have to time most things but yeah good. have fun playing it. if your bored its a fun lots of different type of games in it.
0060558121|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. And, shamefully, my first Neil Gaiman. Decided I need to read him after watching his wonderful Doctor Who episode which finally (and cleverly) gives life to the Tardis.<br /><br />Loved the concept. Loved the twists. Loved the characters-- particularly Shadow who is responsible for really drawing me into this book and making it something I could not put down. Anything else I could say about this would be spoilery, so I'll abstain. I will say, though, I could've done without the epilogue. Wish I had just not read it-- stronger ending without. Also, I've been shaking my head lately at the new trend of zombies as the new go-to protagonist-- zombies as lawyers, zombies in love, etc. Something I saw no entertainment value in. But Gaiman is very clever with his zombie-like character, who is making me rethink my whole \\"anti-zombies as protagonists\\" stance, though I doubt anyone else can pull it off as well.<br /><br />Also, I couldn't help but read this book through the Christian perspective of \\"idols are everything we prioritize and worship in front of God.\\" So if you can push through the horrifying murderous sex scene very early in the book (which is honestly very out of place in this book), then you can find many sermon illustrations.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|It Just Does Not Work Period! No matter what way you want to try it! It will just fail you miserably!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As much as I hate to admit it, I loved this series. The characters have such on each other. Of course, the writing itself could benefit from a few more edits, perhaps by a group of professionals rather than a 6th grade lit class. If you can put up with the redundancy of some words/phrases and odd use of words, then you should be able to enjoy the story that is happening within all the grammatical crud.
B0039NJTLQ|1.0|This second hand American version of the original brilliant Danish product of director Susanne Bier is quite simply Hollywood's pandering to the deep-seated psychological need for extreme sentimentality on the part of the miseducated American masses. Although it will be viewed by most Americans as totally satisfactory, for anyone with enough life experience to have become a mature adult of the world, it will set your teeth on edge with its maudlin-hearted take of the original.<br /><br />The unabashedly pro-American military turn impressed upon it by Hollywood is embarrassing. From a powerful piece of real drama, the American version has turned the film into a political statement not at all subtly lauding our nation's obsession with military adoration.<br /><br />It will likely be viewed as a deep piece of American film art by many Americans. Nonetheless, it is a fake piece of drama, parading as a serious work. From Ms. Bier's truly impressive film, Hollywood has magnificently turned it into mediocrity. Transforming the mental struggle of a man who has made a desperate ethical and moral mistake into a cheap imitation, Hollywood has drained it of life.<br /><br />See Susanne Bier's original if you want to see excellent writing, directing, and acting impressively striving for and approaching truth.
0451197968|4.0|Such a perfect concept. Weak in execution-- which makes sense given the amount of time King gave himself to write this. Four stars instead of three because I found myself wanting to talk about this book with everyone. I'm curious to see how the film version stacks up. There's so much action in such a small amount of space-- I had to reread a couple of sections just to make sure what I thought happened actually happened. Already because of the casting, I sense that the movie takes some different choices with the story than the book. Anyway-- interesting. Thought-provoking. Worth reading. And quick.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|A young troubled high school teen named Andrew buys a video camera and commences to filming his everyday life from his drunk dad, to his friends, to his high school day consisting of being picked on and being told not to film the cheerleaders. It seems his life is quite hopeless and dreary until he and his two friends discover a cave, go exploring in it and find some strange glowing rock formation that knocks them all and the camera out.<br /><br />Once the camera is back on they appear to be fine but its quickly obvious they each have some kind of super power thanks to said glowing rocks. At first its just moving objects with their minds and having fun but if it stopped at that it would be a boring movie. As expected they start to want to do more with their new found gifts, namely Andrew who develops a taste for using it for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Since this is all filmed from Andrew's camera it tries to lend a sense of realism much like \\"Cloverfield\\" attempted to with the monster movie genre. \\"Chronicle\\" does have some impressive visuals, decent story that feels a little real life and some good acting as it really just focuses on the main 3 friends with other actors only making occasional appearances. Its quite a fun movie even if it feels hokey some of the time you're watching it. *** out of 4 stars.
0307959856|1.0|Painful, just painful. I knew within the first few pages that this book was awful, and I'm not sure why I continued reading, except that I really hate quitting books. The mystery was simply not compelling and the characters were abysmal. This second point is especially problematic since James didn't create these character-- she borrowed them from Austen. And in borrowing them, she insists on sucking all the life out of them. The only similarities they hold to Austen's characters are their names, their general relationships to one another, and their time period. It is depressing to think that Elizabeth Darcy's future involves being an excellent hostess, caring wife, and a dull person. Not the Elizabeth Darcy that Austen dreamed up.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|*Warning: Spoilers Ahead*<br />I really wanted to give Snow White and the Huntsman 5 stars. There were a few things that kept me from it. There were a couple different scenes that I felt were unfinished, as if more should have been added to them, or that there were missing scenes altogether. The effects are spectacular, truly mesmerizing at times. The costumes were immaculate and I could tell they were very well thought out. The battle scenes lacked... well, a lot. Most of them seemed to be too brief, and a few appeared to lack common sense.<br />I had hoped that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) would have done a better job of playing her part. \\"Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing...\\" While very pretty, and having no problem looking the part of Snow, Stewart seems lazy or overconfident in her role. Her performance gets a 3 star from me.<br />The movie brings to life the classic fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but in a dark, twisted way, I might add. After the death of Snow White's (Kristen Stewart) mother, her father discovers a slave woman, dirty and locked in chains, in a carriage. With beauty beyond measure, Ravenna (Charlize Theron) - who gets 5 stars from me - takes his breath away, steals his heart, and within a day agrees to be his Queen. On their wedding night, Ravenna declares that her heart has been broken by a King before, and no other will ever get the chance to do it again. She stabs him to his death.<br />Now, the Queen for 10 years, Ravenna has everything, including a magic mirror that could possibly answer any question she could think to ask it. But her one nervous question, asked often, is this, \\"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is fairest of them all?\\" For she would destroy any and all maidens who's beauty surpasses her own. To keep her flawless, un-aging body, she has to suck the youth and innocence from young girls like I would imagine a succubus or demon would.<br />One day the mirror tells Ravenna that Snow White's beauty will soon pass her own. But if Ravenna can kill her, she will have her beauty and immortality forevermore. So she sends her devoted brother to the towers where Snow White had been imprisoned since her father's death, leaving everyone in the kingdom to think that she was also dead.<br />Cleverly, Snow White escapes and runs into the Dark Forest. The dangers that await her there are extreme, but not worth going back to face her evil step-mother that will surely rip out her heart to gain immortality and beauty forever.<br />Ravenna offers to bring back to life the dead wife of the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) - who also gets 5 stars from me - if he can bring Snow back to her. He reluctantly agrees, but after finding Snow he listens to her pleas that the Queen is lying, and she will give him no such reward.<br />The Huntsman fights to save her from the Queen's brother and the dangers of the forest. And just when you think they will be safe, something threatens their lives again. They meet up with 8 dwarfs who try to help her, too. But the Queen seems to always be one step ahead. Ravenna uses a spell to transform herself to look like a close childhood friend of Snow's. The Queen in disguise offers her a bright red, poisonous apple, and after only one bite, it sends Snow to her death.<br />All her friends grieve the loss of Snow White. Her childhood friend, William (Sam Claflin) kisses her goodbye, then leaves her alone in the room with the Huntsman. The Huntsman then begins to confess his undying love to Snow and admits to having two loves in his life and failing them both. He kisses her goodbye and leaves the room she is in.<br />Snow opens her eyes, walks out to the crowd and plots to take back over the kingdom and kill the Queen.<br />The Queen finally falls to her own death by the hand of Snow White, but only after the death of quite a few people along the way. The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the evil is lifted from the land.<br />All in all I thought this movie was great, but there was definitely room for improvement, hence the 4 stars. I will buy it the day it comes out on Blu-Ray, and probably watch it numerous times. One last thing, I took my 6 year old daughter to see it. The violence of the battle scenes was a little too much for her. But I highly recommended it for ages 10 and up!<br /><br />Review written by K.S.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Excellent story - less traditional than your typical vampire / witch tale.<br /><br />The romantic relationship is a little rocky in the beginning - but it develops exceptionally well. There are also a large number of characters thrown at you in the first few chapters that aren't multifacted - some seem to be placeholders - so juggling all the names is a little tricky at the beginning.<br /><br />The interplay of the species is very interesting - I won't spoil it for you but at the end of the novel it all makes sense. Surprised that this species angle hasn't been explored previously.<br /><br />I have already pre-ordered the next novel in the series, if that is any indication of how much I enjoyed this book. Can't wait!
B007XWFZSA|5.0|As someone who has practiced many cases and read the leading books and materials on case interview prep, I was not sure how much I would gain from Cheng's book.

B000ERU5EK|5.0|This CD is certainly one of the all time great trance CD's and its a reminder of what trance used to sound like when it was euphoric.  The trance CD's of today i.e. Anjunabeats worldwide 4 and ATB sunset beach session 2 are the new sound of trance which i dont care for.  I hope this is just a phase that trance music is going through and hopefully one day it will go back to the pre 2008 sound.  Until then i will enjoy this classic CD and songs like \\"Can't sleep\\", \\"Hope\\" and \\"World on fire\\"  will keep me more than satisfied. This CD is a must for all trance fans especially if you like it old school.

It has become one of my all-time favorites and has re-introduced me to Beth Hart.  Just had to purchase more of her music!

B008ALAHA4|4.0|The Macbook Airs and Pros introduced in June 2012 come with the new MagSafe 2 power adapter.  It's identical to the original MagSafe adapter except the plug size is different.<br /><br />If you have an original MagSafe power adapter that's the correct wattage for your new Macbook, get this tiny adapter and you'll be able to use it.<br /><br />If you want an extra power adapter for your new Macbook and don't want to pay the full price of a new MagSafe 2 power adapter, you can probably find an original MagSafe power adapter for much less (just make sure it's the correct wattage for your computer), and then use it with this converter.<br /><br />I've posted a few pictures in the \\"customer images\\" section, have a look if you like.<br /><br />One word of caution:  this adapter is so tiny, the size of my thumbnail, it could easily be lost.  For now, I'm keeping it in its box in my laptop bag.<br /><br />Another reviewer said that this adapter won't charge your computer while you're using it.  That's not my experience.  I have used this adapter many times since getting my 2012 Macbook Air, and it always charges the computer while I'm using it (unless the battery is already fully charged).<br /><br />At the time I'm writing this, Amazon's price for this converter is higher than the suggested retail price.  This is a brand new item, I've emailed Amazon and they will hopefully correct the price.  But until then, don't pay more than the suggested retail price.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  First, Ridley Scott is top notch as a director.  Second, I love sci fi, especially scary sci fi. I generally like 3d as well.  So I went to see it in 3d.<br />Let's start with the 3d.  I think animated movies look the best in 3d.  Live action movies are rated by me as good, to poor. Avitar is the exception which I thought was great. I rate the 3d in Prometheus as fair.<br />The movie itself started out to make me think this was going to be really good.  Instead, as the movie dragged on, I found it boring most of the time.  Alien is a movie this is compared to.  There is no comparison.  Alien held my interest from beginning to end. This movie did not.  Maybe it's because there was too much reminiscent of Alien. For me, this wasn't very original.<br />For all the 5 star raters, I think you are very generous.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|Hi all, from a long time reader, infrequent reviewer, and non-writer....<br /><br />I enjoy Scalzi's work, and Old Man's War re-opened my love with SciFi.<br /><br />Redshirts wasn't bad, it was fun and easy to read.  But this (to me) was a mediocre storyline at best, with an unfulfilling climax and ending.  I didn't get really any new ideas or perspectives from reading this (which is why I like SciFi)...  I hope this wasn't because of a contract fulfillment, vs. writing to write.<br /><br />I will certainly look forward to John's future work.
B000068FWC|5.0|In all actuality, BREAKFAST IN AMERICA is probably one of the best albums of the seventies.  SUPERTRAMP employs all of the ingredients that eventually led to their biggest commercial success:  witty, often contemplative, lyrics; strong creative melodies, eccentricity, theatrics and pure exhilaration.<br />Their 4 hit singles speak for themselves:  the pleading request of the marvelous LOGICAL SONG; the passionate fervor of GOODBYE STRANGER with its guitar driven outro that's mindblowing; the harmonica presence of the irresistible TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME and the gentle satire of the bouncy BREAKFAST IN AMERICA.  The remaining tracks are all prime SUPERTRAMP but the album peaks with the purely exuberant CHILD OF VISION.  With its gorgeous chord changes, layered vocals and the remarkable piano playing of Rodger Hodgson, this is progressive rock at its finest.<br />SUPERTRAMP sadly never reached this level again, but this album will remain as one of the decade's most important albums.

0062197258|4.0|Catherine Bailey, like all of us, has a past. However her past has drastically scarred her, leaving her crippled with obsessions and compulsions and avoidance issues. The doctors call it by simple little acronyms like \\"OCD\\" and \\"PTSD\\". I think Catherine would simply call it \\"life shattering\\". Several years ago, she had a violent and obsessive boyfriend, leaving her paranoid and always looking over her shoulder, never trusting her surroundings.<br /><br />Stuart is the upstairs neighbor. Being a therapist, he seems to see beyond all of the compulsions to the woman that lies beneath, and he is drawn to the woman she was and he knows she can be again.<br /><br />I found this gritty and emotional story quite fascinating. When looking at Catherine \\"today\\", you see a broken woman, weak, out-of-control, totally irrational in her behavior. Yet the way that the book is written, shifting quickly from the past to the present and back again, you get to slowly walk through her past relationship, watching it build little-by-little. As you do, you find that the present-day actions and behaviors that previously seemed irrational begin to make total sense. She isn't crazy at all. Her obsessive behaviors seem almost \\"right\\" in light of the past.<br /><br />A note of warning: This book can be quite graphic, violent and vulgar. But it is real, believable, and not exploitative.<br /><br />My final word: Guttural, this story reaches deep within, leaving you a little uneasy as you think perhaps \\"There but by the grace of God go I.\\" How a person can enter your life so innocuously and damage it so irreparably. How you could be taken from a strong and powerful woman, and left shattered and fearful. And mixed in amidst the twisted fears and terror is a touching romantic story. Frightening but intriguing and, in the end, utterly fascinating.

I'm synching it with google docs.

0345529057|5.0|I wanted to read this after watching the HBO show because I heard the books were even better and had more detail to them. The packaging and quality of the books is very good.  This is a really good series and I enjoyed reading it.  You don't find many stories with such deep, fleshed out characters, especially in fantasy which can often have characters who are blindly good or evil.  This series will consume a lot of your time and you will just want to read one book after another.

6305882592|2.0|HAROLD AND MAUDE is one of the films I have heard so much about through the years that I decided it was time to watch it. I had an idea that it was an odd romance between a very young man and an elderly woman played by the always great Ruth Gordon. I was in for a surprise. HAROLD AND MAUDE is not a tender May-December romance. Two very broken people find each other and enjoy their secret world together.<br /><br />Bud Cort is truly remarkable as Harold. No doubt this was his most famous role and he totally takes over the part of Harold, the confused man-child. At first, it seems like he is a young teenager and later he seems older. Cort is able to play a full range with his boyish looks. Harold has an obsession with death. He enjoys staging fake suicides in front of his mother, played but a delightful Vivian Pickles. Pickles is so straightforward with her bizarre fun. She adds some humor to the movie.<br /><br />Harold also enjoys going to funerals--anyone's funeral. He doesn't know them but he shows up as a polite mourner. He enounters the feisty Maude at a funeral and they become fast friends. Her zest for life and disregard for authority entices Harold. It seems like they were destined to be together despite a 50+ year age difference.<br /><br />I know HAROLD AND MAUDE is a cult classic but I just could not enjoy the film. It seemed silly and with no message. The style of filming makes the film look so dated even though much older films do not have such a dated feel.<br />I was hoping to get a deeper insight into these two quirky characters and a brief few seconds almost one hour into the film had me thinking it was all finally going to fall into place. I won't give anything away but there is one very quick shot of something profound that would totally explain why Maude is Maude. It's a quick flash and would be easy to miss. The revelation is brief and intense but not mentioned after that. It's not even clear if Harold realizes with it all means.<br /><br />HAROLD AND MAUDE was just such an all around disappointment. Bud Cort and Vivian Pickles are the bright parts of this very quirky film that could have had potential.D AND MAUDE was just such an all around disappointment.

0385360169|1.0|I listened to the audio book for my book club and if it weren't for wanting to see my friends at the book club - I would have stopped listening and deleted it at the very beginning. The narrator is beyond terrible, she has the most tragic and just god-awful impersonation of a man speaking. The main character is whiney and really really stupid, even if she was a virgin. I don't buy any of it, the writing, the story, Anna is just too dumb for words.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|this is undeniably a fantastic record... i can't wait to see it live, but it sounds pretty bad. i am so frustrated by the record industry's penchant for overcompressing music these days! in my car, which has a pretty decent stock stereo, all the parts that are 'thick' sounding are clipping badly, as if i'm listening to the record while a helicopter flies by outside. there's a thrumming low frequency clipping that is annoying. the parts that are supposed to be airy and chimey sound like they're coming out of a can! i turned down the bass a little past the center detent, and turned the treble up a LOT to compensate... this ticks me off! why should i continue to BUY albums if record companies keep squashing the life out of music like this?! three stars for the crappy sound quality, 10 stars for the music itself...
0786182466|5.0|This hilarious novel set in early 1960's New Orleans is truly an American masterpiece!  It is one of those rare books I find myself rereading (and rediscovering all over again) every few years. Although the author - John Kennedy Toole - tragically passed away before his time and thus was never able to receive his much-deserved praise, his lone novel serves to prove to each and every one of us that we all have at least one great novel inside of us.  After reading (or listening, as it were) A Confederacy of Dunces, I always am left feeling that there were plenty of more masterpieces inside Mr. Toole, but that those stories are sadly lost to us forever.<br /><br />This audio-CD version is excellent and well worth the cost.  The narrator, Barrett Whitener provides a rich variety of character voices that serves to enhance the journey into the wacky, slightly off-kilter world of the novel's protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly.<br /><br />This audio-CD is the perfect companion for a long road trip.  However, I cannot stress enough that your trip might take a bit longer than planned, due to the many times you'll be pulling over due to uncontrollable fits of laughter!  Due to a few \\"F-bombs\\" and some mild sexual content (although it's almost innocent by today's standards), this might not be the best choice for a family vacation road trip... at least until the kids are old enough.<br /><br />After experincing this novel, I'm confident you will join me in saying, \\"Wherever you are Mr. Toole, thank you for giving birth to such amazing characters.  And kudos to Mr. Whitener for providing voices worthly of those wonderfully insane characters.\\"

B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I think my biggest problem with the musical was the writing. The dialogue was cliche, and the words of the songs are changed from what they originally were, and therefore make the music much less powerful. For example, everytime I listen to the soundtrack, I get goosebumps hearing the opening song, but in this case, it was cut all together.That being said, I was also disappointed with the casting, and think Ramin is a much more talented actor/singer. What stands out about the musical are the spiecal effects and orchestration. A lot of people will not like the overall show because it is so different from the original. However, what happens to the characters make sense, and helps us answer a lot of questions, such as, What if Raul wasn't so perfect? Would Christine still choose him?

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Before I bought this book I read some Amazon customer reviews. I understand those readers that were offended.. This book show a man with unusual needs and issues which they might prefer not to think about.That is theirprivilege.  The suggestion that the writing is poor is blatantly false.  The description detailed enough to entrancing to some and off-putting to others? The chacterization grows from little details in actions and words as well as chacter growth for the major characters, in how we know them and how they know each other and themselves.  The plot starts out interesting as a girl graduates college meeting a man with polar opposite points of view.  As the events unfold , things seem to be moving toward a center, a compromise. Our heroine may get what she wants. The climax is inevitable, shocking and even touching.  Enjoy this imperfect man and this strong yet insecure woman. Don't take my word. Read it yourself.

B00000DG1R|5.0|I purchased a used Duran Duran disk for a phenominal bargain.  It plays perfectly.  The only thing I could say bad about it is when you load it into Windows Media, it came up in Japanese writing, but very easily corrected by me.  So I wouldn't take off any points for this.  Very happy with the product!

Everything to please everyone.  Adam shows the true range of his voice, which is totally amazing.  American Idol...hmmm.  Who was first??  I can't remember; I bet after this you will forget if you DO remember.  As I said, Grammy worthy, for sure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a young person, but don't disregard. I am thought of highly in the &#34;Book Review World.&#34;<br /><br />This is Suzanne's greatest novel. I have read some of her previous books, and they do not compare in any way.<br /><br />This nove is about the youngbut mature Katniss Everdeen. She lives in an America that is controlled by the Capitol and President Snow. Each year, the Capitol holds a tournament. In this tournament, 24 &#34;tributes&#34; between the ages of  twelve and eighteen are put into a massive aren. In this arena, the tributes my fight and kill the others. The last one standing is the victor and is given alife of luxury in ther districts 'Victor's Village'. At least, that is what's SUPPOSED to happen...
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Works pretty damn well for me.  A Side note, if you are having the \\"Server Error when trying to fetch data\\" problem on ICS, simply check the \\"Less Color, More Speed\\" Option in the Advanced Settings.  Worked like a charm for me on my A500 ICS.  Resuming a movie from a previous point in the middle still seems a little flaky, but starting from the beginning works fine, so does seeking inside the video once started.  Hopefully they will fix this bug in the next version, but an easy work-around is good enough for now.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is definitely one of the better games available for mobile devices. If you miss it as the free app of the day, you can pick it up in the Google Play market for free. The Play market version is also a newer version and plays identically to the Amazon version, including not having any ads.<br />This is a very fun game and should appeal to almost anyone, not just golf fans. The game plays more like a physics-based aiming game instead of a traditional golf game. Levels are 2D and are played side to side with different vertical paths and obstacles to shoot through. There are also a ton of levels at your disposal. The only gripe I have is that you must play a full course, which is 10 boards, or holes, in one playthrough. The game doesn't allow for you to stop after 4 or 5 holes and come back to it later. You must finish all 10 holes to complete the course for it to register your score, or start from the beginning the next time you play. Each hole takes about 2-3 minutes to complete. There's also no way to replay an individual hole, you have to start the entire 10-hole course all over again. If the developers were able to address these issues, this would be a perfect game.<br />Just to clear up something that others have been saying about the free Google Play version... The Play version mentions that it uses Openfeint, though it is completely optional and up to the user whether or not to enable it. Openfeint is NOT a horrendous thing that others make it out to be. It's a leader board system so people can post scores competitively against other players. It's NOT a data miner (the favorite phrase that the paranoid ignorance of Amazon loves to throw around). It accesses your scores so it can post them to be compared with others. That's it! It's simply a multilayer feature for those that wish to use it. If you don't feel comfortable using it, you're not forced to. I've noticed most Amazon users are clueless as to what Openfeint actually is.<br />Regardless, this is a game that shouldn't be missed!that shouldn't be missed!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As the book was nearing it's conclusion, I kept thinking there was no way the author could find a good way to end the story. Yet, once again, Nicholas Sparks proved he is a master writer. The ending was perfect.
0345803507|1.0|A lot of things have been written and said about the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy so I thought I'd give the books a chance.  Having steadfastly refused to read any of the Stephanie Meyer books (I'm not down with vampires that sparkle in the sunshine and play baseball) and not seen any of the movies, I was completely unaware that the books started out as \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction.  If I had known exactly what it was, I probably wouldn't have read them.<br /><br />Yes, all of the \\"oh my\\"-ing, \\"holy\\" this and \\"holy\\" that got really tiresome about halfway through the first book, and I honestly thought that if she referred to him as \\"Fifty\\" one more time I was going to scream.  A lot of reviewers have commented on the juvenile writing style and the repetitiveness of the dialogue, but that's only just part of my issues with the books.<br /><br />First and foremost, I loathed the character of Ana.  I am no stranger to unsympathetic heroines (\\"The Custom of the Country\\" my favorite of Edith Wharton's books) and I know Ana Steele was initially based on Bella Swan, who is apparently spineless, but if James was going to release the story as a stand-alone, then she should have re-thought and re-written her heroine.  Ana spends a great deal of her time wondering why Christian wants her, and by the time I finished the third book, I found myself asking that question, too.  He says she challenges him.  How exactly does she do that?  Every time he growls at her, glowers at her (there was a lot of growling and glowering) she caves in to his demands.  She even let him beat her because he wanted to, not because she wanted it.  Her feelings, at best, were somewhat ambivalent about all the spanking, yet she let him do it.  Doesn't sound like much of a challenge to me.<br /><br />Secondly, the character of Christian I found a bit more interesting but I was left unsatisfied by his development.  I guess it's supposed to be a female fantasy to fix a broken man, but does James really intend us to believe that Ana accomplished in less than two months what 20+ years of intensive therapy could not?  So all this man really needed was the love of a good woman to get him to give up almost 15 years of BDSM?  I call shenanigans. And then, after three books full of sturm un drang, the big reveal of the root of his issues was anticlimactic.  Anyone with an IQ over 75 could see the it coming a mile away.  His predilections would have made more sense if Elliot and Mia had been Grace and Carrick's natural children, with Christian being the only one adopted.  That way, when he says the thing about not being perfect in a family full of perfect people, it would have had more weight behind it.<br /><br />I think the books would have been far more interesting had the author:<br /><br />1.  Resisted the chance to make more money and simply condensed the books into one.  There was no point in making a trilogy of this lightweight story.  A denser, more nuanced story would have been more satisfying to the reader.<br /><br />2.  Explored the BDSM aspect a bit more without all of the unnecessary sex scenes.  Since she is apparently into plagiarism, she should have copied A. N. Roqeulaure's (Ann Rice, for the uninitiated) \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" trilogy.  The story would have been more compelling had Ana actually allowed herself to explore Christian's lifestyle a bit.  There would have been a chance for her to understand why he likes to bind, gag and spank pretty brunettes without all of the tedious questioning about Leila, Mrs. Robinson and all the other subs.  This would have given some density to the stories and allowed the reader to fully understand why she leaves him.  As it is, I thought she was pretty damned stupid for storming out the way she did.  After all, what did she expect when she let him beat her with a belt?  I know she said that she had never been physically disciplined by her parents, but even so, she couldn't have expected it to tickle.<br /><br />3.  Allowed Ana and Christian more time during the break up.  That way, Ana could date a few other people, experience sex with someone other than a sadistic control freak, and then decide if she really wants to spend the rest of her life with a sore ass.  It would also have allowed Christian to go back to his lifestyle and perhaps slowly discover that it wasn't as fulfilling as being with Ana.  But the way James paced things, the reconciliation seemed so unbelievable.  After only five days without this woman we're supposed to believe that Christian is so overwrought that he decides to abandon his sexual behaviors on a whim?<br /><br />A great many of the problems with this book could have been overcome with something as simple as a night school course in creative writing.  It seems like there was kernel of a good idea in this book but the author completely squandered her chance to expand on it.

B003L16FAE|1.0|Predator is a classic sci-fi action film, and fans have been waiting for a proper release of this film on Blu-ray. When Fox announced the Ultimate Hunter Edition, we all rejoiced. That is until we seen the quality of the movie on the disc.<br /><br />The movie has undergone a heavy scrubbing with the use of Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). For whatever reason, studios are using the more and more on catalog titles released on Blu-ray. Sadly, because most people don't understand what DNR is and what it does to the image.<br /><br />Digital Noise Reduction is an automated process done to the image to reduce noise and artifacts on the video. DNR can be used to a positive effect (see the recent remaster of the Alien films for example), but studios are overdoing it. If you look at the image on this edition of the Blu-ray, you'll see that the texture of people's skin has been made almost as smooth as a Barbie doll. What the DNR has done is not only remove the noise from the video, but also all the fine detail that Blu-ray is supposed to provide. You're actually getting less detail than the standard DVD because of all the missing video information that has been scrubbed away.<br /><br />If you'd like to see other movies that have been the victim of heavy DNR, check out the Blu-rays of American Psycho, Tremors, Walking Tall, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
0439023521|3.0|All together this book is very entrancing but the writing style of it is very poor i am by no means an English professor but i know enough about writing to say that it is not up to standard i kept reading it to the end and it kept changing from 1rst to 2nd to 3rd person styles kids and teens wont care but adults might have some trouble following what is happening again all in all this was a good book
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is fantastic. The writing is what drew me in at first - as I knew the story was going to be interesting at least. The characters are relatable and even though they are pushed to extremes there are still passages that everyone can associate with. I would highly reccomend this book. The only downside is that it went by too fast - even though it is a moderately lengthy 400 pages and it is really hard to find something to read after it as nothing seems to measure up.<br /><br />Overall very fast paced book that actually continues to surprise you to the very end.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I was a bit disconserted because when I played it on my computer there were chinese-like hieroglyphics for the CD information. The same thing when I ripped it to the computer. Song names were not in English. Fortunately the casing info was in English. I would not have knowingly purchased this product as is. Product itself was very good.
B004SIP7F8|1.0|If this movie proves one thing, it is that you should never trust the Academy to make proper decisions with regard to what movie should win an award.  This movie is too long.  It seems like it is longer than WW II.  It is boring.  It is not deep.  There is no point to the movie. The romance is boring and embarrassingly vacuous.  This is the kind of movie liberals want you to watch so they can prove how sophisticated they are for liking something that most people would find uninteresting because it is uninteresting.
1936608898|5.0|I am a long time follower of the authors, with a few Whole30s (if you don't know what this is, read the book!!) under my belt, so I had high expectations for this book.  I am a little surprised the book actually met, and exceeded my expectations.  With every passing chapter I think of more people in my life that NEED this book.  It reads quickly and easily and is entertaining as well as being packed with massive amounts of information.<br />The writing is in plain English but science-y enough to satisfy even the more biology-interested reader.  You WILL know about insulin, leptin, glycogen, and more.  And you will truly understand it, it won't be some vague notion you kind of get, kind of don't.  You will know it is all true because their vivid descriptions of how you feel when you eat the \\"supernormally stimulating, nutrient-poor, carbohydrate dense foods\\" are so dead on.<br />Even though I already subscribe to the diet and lifestyle that Dallas and Melissa recommend, this book has been a strong reinforcement to tighten things up a little more and really live my life to the max.<br />Get this book, you won't be sorry.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Other than the seemingly forced appearance by one of cinema's most famous monsters at the end, Prometheus is very much a film that stands on its own apart from the Alien universe . Sir Ridley Scott and co. I think were very wise in going toward a different direction for the franchise and to focus on the \\"Engineers\\" . As a result those like myself who is a big fan of the Alien movies are introduced to a much richer universe.<br />I am intrigued by the character of Dr. Shaw because she not only is a person of science but a person of faith as well and this dichotomy I think is the basis of her journey, which is the search for truth to humanity's origins. To me I think the true horror in this movie are not the horrible creatures that wreck havoc on the crew of the Prometheus but the revelation that the gods or God have forsaken their creations and even worse intend to destroy what they made(What if you found out that you were a mistake?). Dr. Shaw's discovery does not make her want to run back to Earth but instead drives her to find the source of the \\"Engineers\\" thus her journey continues for answers  and sets us up for a sequel which I certainly hope happens.<br />This is another winner from Ridley Scott. The cinematography is awe-inspiring. The art direction is superb. The effects enhance. The music by Marc Streitenfeld is channeling Vangelis (composer of Scott's Bladerunner and 1492).<br />The most thrilling scene of the movie is Dr. Shaw's self surgery to remove an unwanted embryo from her body. Definitely a keeper.<br />Michael Fassbender treats us to another great performance as the artificial man DAVID 8 who himself was engineered by humanity which introduces us to another potential dichotomy that can be explored in the sequel. He is definitely more interesting than most of the human crew. You can call him a HAL 9000 with legs.<br />As a film Prometheus truly stands apart from the rest of the Alien films. In fact the presence of the \\"Alien\\" or xenomorph in the film is almost questionable. If you remove that then the only thing that ties this movie to Alien are the \\"Engineers\\". So what we have here is really a spinoff which makes it all the more interesting for fans of the Alien universe. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wanted this to be a good read; however I'm strangely disappointed.  The writing itself is well done in that there is good structure and strong details.  The characters are so weak.  You want to like Ana, but she turns out to be silly and immature.  She goes for weak little girl to a strong willed woman is seconds.  She flip-flops more than Mitt Romney.  Christen would never be a billionaire.  He has no drive.  Ana's airhead mother is suddenly insightful without any explanation.  The relationship both Ana's roommate and Christen brother adds no value.  The characters are weak to the point of distraction.<br />As for the erotic content- please.  Just get any good gothic romance and you'll get much more erotica.

B006LSZECO|1.0|There are plenty of reviews discussing what the book is about, so I will skip that..  I had read way over half of this book when I started emailing friends it was one of the best books I read in a long time and recommended they buy it immediately.<br /><br />I just finished the book a few minutes ago and all I can say is: \\"Really that is how you wrapped up the ending?\\". It was awful.  I would not have cared if it was a happy or sad ending, but this ending made me now hate the book.<br /><br />Now I am emailing everyone to tell them NOT to buy this book.  Honestly I can't imagine what she was thinking.  I had planned to buy her previous two books but not now.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Rats and mice and rabbits make favorite characters of many movies, both Disney and non-Disney.  Whether it be Mouse Hunt, Stuart Little, or the various Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny cartoons, they range from average to good, with an occasional cult classic like Mouse Hunt.  Then Pixar came along with this full-length feature, Ratatouille.  Packing romance, comedy and a little suspense into the streets of Paris with a prologue in the French countryside, this is my favorite movie by Pixar so far.  Several strands of the movie pick up from previous Pixar releases, the key one being the dual male leads, Remy and Linguini, which is found in Monsters Inc, Cars, Toy Story, and Up.  Another feature shared with previous Pixar films is the seamless and flawless interactions between the human characters and the non-human ones.  In this case, the relationship between the rats and people as shown in this movie look so real and logical, with perfect animation of facial expressions and movements.<br /><br />Now to the package.  Like other Disney releases, we get a Blu-ray and DVD containing identical features; the film, deleted scenes, the Pixar short, and the extra film that comes only with the package.  In this case, the latter is a \\"documentary\\" narrated by Remy about the relationship between rats and people over the years.  This extra film is actually funnier than the Pixar short and the feature film itself.  The deleted scenes are all partially animated, and nothing noteworthy to speak of.  All in all, a great buy for the family.
B007R41E8O|4.0|...right up to the horrible Owl Creekish ending.

0151013837|4.0|This is a submission for an English Composition course.<br /><br /> `Life of Pi' is a riveting fictional novel about Piscine Patel, a young Indian boy whose family decides to sell their family zoo animals to move to Canada. The story is told from the perspective of Piscine or Pi as well as the journalist interviewing Pi in his later life. The carrier ship that Pi, his family, and their animals were travelling upon sinks in the middle of the ocean. There is much foreboding foreshadowing that takes place at the beginning of the novel that lets the reader know such a tragic event is going to take place.<br /> Although a tale of survival, the themes of storytelling and belief in God are present. From the beginning, when observing the zoo animals in India, Pi reflects \\"I don't mean to defend zoos. ...I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both\\" (Martel, 14). As a young boy in India, Pi takes a great interest in spirituality and religion; he becomes a practitioner of Christianity, Hinduism, and Muslim. \\"A germ of religious exaltation, no bigger than a mustard seed, was sown in me and left to germinate. It has never stopped growing since that day\\" admits Pi (Martel, 25). Once thrown into the situation of having to survive, Pi attempts to find the presence of God and continues to pray, \\"I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine...Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen.\\" (Martel, 250). The reader is presented with the notion that it's not so much the particular religion one chooses but the belief they have in God that is of importance. Pi fully relates this when stating \\"If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for? Isn't love hard to believe?...ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer.\\" (Martel, 292).<br /> The majority of the novel describes the measures Pi goes through in his determination of survival. His lifeboat initially contains himself, an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Mr. Richard Parker. Quickly the laws of nature reign when the elements at sea begin to affect every living thing on this small boat. Eventually there is just Pi and Richard Parker attempting to coexist between the boat and a small lifejacket raft Pi attached to the boat. They survive on rain water, fish, and the occasional sea turtle. Pi is in constant fear of Mr. Richard Parker, a predator never far but must be dominated if Pi wishes to live.<br />The art and act of storytelling is perfected by the author Yann Martel in how the character Pi thoroughly describes these hardships. The entire story is enrapturing but within chapter 99, when Pi is questioned by Mr. Okamoto, a man sent to investigate how and why the carrier ship sank, is when the most compelling part of the novel takes place. When Mr. Okamoto does not believe Pi's story of survival that includes the animals, especially Richard Parker, Pi tells the same story where each animal is replaced by a living person from the carrier ship (Pi's mother, sailors, the cook). The horrors of death and cannibalism become much more gruesome and unsettling with this telling and Pi then asks \\"'So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?'...Mr. Okamoto: Yes. The story with animals is the better story. Pi Patel: `Thank you. And so it goes with God.'\\" (Martel, 317). It makes no factual difference whether God does or does not exist; the `better story' filled with light and hope then is to believe that God does exist.<br /><br />Martel, Yann. Life of Pi. New York: Harcourt, Inc., 2001.
B001HC8516|5.0|As a Soulmate Coach and author of Manifesting Your Soulmate,I love this book.<br />The authors have condensed all the possible answers to so many dating questions into<br />one simple all encompassing phrase: \\"He's just not that into you.\\"  The phrase<br /> solves so many possible problems that women can encounter with unsuitable dates.<br /> If a woman encounters any thing from a guy who is uncommitted to<br />distant to negligent, she doesn't have to wrack her brains about what<br />she did, could have done, or possibly should have done to get him<br />to treat her better.<br />She can just admit early on that he's just not that into her and move on<br />to someone else who appreciates who she is and wants to treat her in a manner that<br /> she'd prefer.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|As a financial advisor, the meltdown of 2008 personally hit my clients and me very hard.  This documentary is a powerful reminder of what happened during that time-- and all of the dishonesty, greed and debauchery in the financial and political arenas.  I was disgusted at Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blanfein's responses during questioning in front of the Congressional panel- he could not have been more out of touch.  And Dick Fuld- where is he now?  Why not in jail?  Matt Damon does an awesome job of delivering the content; his voice perfectly flowed with adequate amounts of disbelief and amazement.  This film is a must-see for everyone who lost even a single dollar in the financial meltdown-- and for anyone to say it was the fault of one company or one political party is deeply incorrect.  The scary part is that things haven't changed much in response to this debacle... what's next for USA??

B003IKMR0U|5.0|Okay another game exposed to me by TableTop on YouTube.  What can I say!  Zombie Dice is sooo much fun!  My kids LOVE IT!  They want to play it all the time!  They ask to share it with their friends!  They even Play it Online via Chat with their uncle who also recently discovered it!<br /><br />The Basics are simple... You are a Zombie!  You Eat Brains!  The dice are People!  The dice have brains, running footprints, and shotgun blasts on them.  Obviously if you get brains you get to eat them!  If you get running footprint, the person got away.  And of course if you get shot, you end your turn after three blasts!  First player to pass 13 and keep the highest number of brains wins.  So that is it in its simplest form.  Of course you need to add in your own sound effects and laughter!<br /><br />Durability, well it comes in a smallish sized tumbler made of a cardboard.  Mind you the cardboard is thick, but it wears easily with much use.  The dice are dice so.<br /><br />Education?  Um, well with the impending zombie apocalypse I suppose we all need to start practicing!<br /><br />Take a chance, its great fun and has an expansion set to make things more interesting!  BRAIIINNNSSSS!!!!!

0553582038|5.0|Do not believe all the negative comments you hear about Feast for Crows - it is right up there with the first three books in the Game of Thrones collection.  It is, however, very different from the other books in that it does not include all of the main characters we have come to know.  If you can go into Feast for Crows knowing that the stories are going to center on Cersei, Brienne, and Jaime (with some time also spent on the Greyjoys, the Martells, Samwell, Arya, and Sansa) and will not at all deal with Jon Snow, Stannis, or Danereys you will not be disappointed.  The only one of the plot lines that seem unnecessary is the one involving Brienne, but the rest are very well done.  Other than that, a really great read that I could not put down!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. its essentually Mario, my bf compete to see who can get the higher score. it doesn't have any glitches that I've seen so far and doesn't take up to much space. definately worth the download.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|I just seriously love listening to her sing.  She doesn't have the traditional great voice but what makes her great and amazing is the fact that her vocal style is so unique, makes me a huge fan.  I love her lyrics.  She's pretty deep.
B007MJ9LA2|1.0|This is not a good effort. If Santana is trying to put together themes for a \\" Western\\",then well done.<br />I was bored all the way except for track 11 and the last half of 12 that faded out just when it was getting good.<br />Pass on this one.<br />Carlos, Otis is calling!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very entertaining. If u like Sims and other games like it then you will enjoy this too. It is also very addictive. You won't want to put it down.
B000002IO1|2.0|I mostly got this for Black Velvet.....but of course, I was going to listen to the rest of the album.  Listened to it twice and I honestly just don't like it.  I can't pinpoint what my reason is, all I know is, that I don't like.  Luckily I didn't pay much for it.
B001R3YRG2|1.0|I was excited to watch this film as I remember seeing parts of it when I was a child.  I was quickly dissapointed though.  The scenes of urban decay, racial tensions and so on seemed to be very surface level and cheesy.  If you want to see a realistic and moving film which presents the loneliness and alienation caused by modern urban society watch Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver instead.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|A decent app for the cost. Reasonable entertainment and challenge. Earn $ in game rather than spill real money. Flick is way better for actual graphics but hey, it is called Super Stickman!
B0086700CM|5.0|Simple controls and fast gameplay make for a highly addictive gaming experience. If you have not played this yet, then you are missing out.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|After reading the 50 Shades trilogy, Beautiful Disaster was recommended by Amazon, so I decided to download the book and am glad I did. While there were grammatical errors, they did not take my attention away from the storyline. Travis and Abby have great chemistry and it is easy to see why they fall for each other. Initially, it seems as if the plot will be based around \\"good girl\\" meets \\"bad boy\\", but upon further reading, you realize that Abby is attempting to escape her past/upbringing and Travis can't escape his. So, she isn't as \\"good\\" as you are lead to believe and his reasons for being \\"bad\\" are believable and understandable once you learn about his upbringing. This may have been easier for some readers to accept had the author given a brief glimpse into Abby's past prior to her arrival at Eastern. Then, other subplots within the book may not have seemed as far-fetched as some other reviewers found them to be. I can actually see this book transferring smoothly to the big screen and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quick read romance that pulls you in right away.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|This application performs as advertised. The only reason I did not award it five stars is because of the delay. It doesn't keep up with me as well as I would like, but it is still the best of its kind for Kindle. I am pleased with this app and feel that it was worth the asking price.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|such an amazing movie, you'll be singing the songs days after seeing it. i started singing and dancing, it was like being at a rock concert(:
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! LOL the graphics are great and the game is fun as ever. I'm glad they made this game for android :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It starts off like a young adult  novel. Layken (Lake) is 18, but is very mature. It's more like reading about adults, especially once you're in the core of the book. I loved it...a lot. This is my first recommendation because I loved it so much. It's a shorter read...and there is a 2nd book, but that's short too. I love the characters.<br />Basically, 18 year old Layken, her mom and little brother move to a new town....she meets the hot neighbor and instantly likes him...but for reasons I don't want to spoil, dating is pretty much off limits. You'll find out early on....<br />Even though this books deals with such sensitive subjects, and hard times, there is such a bright side, and it's such a great read. I wanted to know the people in the book - and I loved their relationships. It was a `real' book and I loved every minute of it. I actually went and read the second book as soon as I was done with the first one because I didn't want to be done with these characters. The characters were people I would want to hang out with!<br />Their friendships were realistic, and their lives were fun (even in the midst of all the drama)
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is such an amazing game!!!! everyone should play it! its challenging but very fun<br />guys u should get this game :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love love love angry birds it is a great great great game to play and its vry very very challenging  i hope they come out with a another one that is more challenging  and fun
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game cant put it down. total blast. never knew I could be in to these sort of games.
B00881VLCE|5.0|if you like puzzles then you will really enjoy playing this game. it has different levels of challenges from beginners. to pros.
1401937268|5.0|Very nice. A little hard to shuffle, so use the \\"pour them on the table and mix them up\\" method (I'm sure there is a better definition for this).
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I had it for a long time, then the updated version came out. I instantly updated it. It has all the swords and backgrounds that apple has. It just became even more fun. But, if you are updating it, all your swords and backgrounds will be deleted.
B007EJ6S92|5.0|I did very little research on this album, as I've been listening to Moonspell since around 1995.  When they release a new album, I buy it!  Well, I was a little surprised when I received the package and the case was so big.  I had no idea that it was 2 discs!  I listened to Alpha Noir first.  It seems like it's more in the vein of Night Eternal; heavy and very theatrical in its presentation.  It is, in my mind, a perfect example of what gothic metal should sound like - dark, heavy and with great guitar solos.  Omega White was the complete opposite.  Still very good, but much calmer and very atmospheric - much like The Darkness and Hope.<br /><br />As it is with every Moonspell album, you'll find songs with a lot of depth and development.  I can see these two CD's rotating in and out of my CD player for weeks now!  The only problem that I'll have is determining which to listen to, since they're both awesome!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|even though we all seen this kind of film before, this it the 1st time they do it in documentary style. the last 7 min of the movie kept me on edge, reminded me of the anime classic 'akira'. worth your time and money.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Awesome awes .. true they sound a lot like other groups like The White Stripes and such, but as far as I'm concerned there will always be a place for blues influenced garage rock in american music.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|i have to say i was expecting more. the only good points was the action with ghost rider.....and what the hell was with nick cages over acting?????? ghost rider is suppose to be a dark anti hero, not a guy that tell jokes, or acts quirky even after he's transformed. could have been better. also there was some point where he could have sped up the killing, like when the ghost rider 1st appears for a fight, he heald this thugs head for like a whole min till he killed him with his stare. the directors that did this movie also did the 'crank' series. idk if that was their direction with nick's character, but this movie could have been more dark and serious. and wheres the spikey leather jacket???!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we love it. very entertaning. it is very exciting to get to new levels and buy new animals. my kids really enjoy finding different ways to earn coins and acorns.
B007SSEU9O|2.0|This was a surrealistic look at Margaret Thatcher and the trailer is totally misleading.  It cut in and out of her life which I suppose was as an elderly woman, portraying her somewhat with dementia and delusions with some info from flashbacks? to the time that she was Prime Minister and how she got there.  There were four of us watching this we all came away wondering what that was about.  It felt like a Dali painting you know its supposed to be a woman but the parts are all over the place.<br /><br />Margaret Thatcher was a fascinating woman she deserved better....Meryl Streep, the real selling point in the trailer was, as usual fabulous.
043902353X|5.0|I was on my toes so to speak the whole time I was reading. It was the second book though that had my stomach in knots though. Amazingly breath taking, Catching Fire is a MUST READ. I hope everyone enjoys the books by Suzanne Collins as much as I did. Until next time, BookGirl1788
B0045KS6M0|4.0|It is a movie and it plays like a movie. It was easy to download and pay for. No complaints
B0054JELS4|5.0|Top quality show. The episodes are worth seeing over and over again. Yes, there are reruns on cable, but the nice thing about the DVD's is seeing the progression of a subplot from show to show over the course of a season. The price was great, too.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|Love these soundtracks - I have all 4 that have came out and can't wait for the last. I love that they pick artists that are not mainstream and go with music that fits the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|quite impressive with all the functions, features and settings . heading on an eight state road trip and can use to my advantage to be alerted for all up coming weather.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun for all ages!  My mom and I play it all the time together. We really like the way we can earn alot of points for games. It never gets boring the way some games do. Great variety of games and skill levels!
0345803485|4.0|The highly anticipated book purchased from Amazon.com arrived earlier than I expected. Love their service. I was salivating as I ripped off the cover and began reading even before the UPS man was out of sight. I was expecting naughtiness on a grand scale and was not disappointed. Both shocked and titilated I read nearly non-stop until I finished it 2 & 1/2 days later, taking time out only to eat and sleep. It is not pornographic in the sense of men's literature. Men like larger than life graphic pictures and are put off by anything romantic, well written, witty or subtle. This is strictly for the ladies. Read it. If the subject matter intrigues you, casually leave the book lying around and tell the man in your life not to read it. That shouldd insure that he will read it and perhaps get some ideas of his own.
1250000971|3.0|I loved the first book in this series and couldn't wait to get my hands on The Sins of the Father.  While the book followed a similar format to the first, the plot left me wishing for more.  Large gaps in the story lines, neatly tied up loose ends, and a quick wrap up left me looking for more.  While it was a nice weekend read, I find myself less impatient for the next book to come out than I was after reading the first.
B004EPZ084|1.0|Probably one of the worst films ever made.  Someone owes me several minutes of my life back.  Plot is stupid, but the acting is even worse.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a great, uplifting story written beautifully by Cheryl Strayed. I love her writing style especially when she describes her anguish and pain. Definitely a powerful read.
B0068FZ07Y|3.0|American Graffitti is and likely always will be one of the greatest Americana movies ever made.  I had already owned a copy for a long time but was attracted to the offer of a digital copy I could take along on my laptop or even better on a memory stick.  I naively expected the digital copy to be on a DVD packaged with the original. Not so, it involved downloading the movie on line, something I was unable to accomplish successfully depite spending about 3 hours trying.  I think it successfully downloaded, but I cannot get my computer to play it.  It simply gives a a dialogue box telling me it is copywrited material.  I now own two copies of the same great movie, niether of which will play on the computer.
B007DJUO8O|3.0|First, I should point out that while I am very familiar with Steven Wilson's work, I have heard only a little of Mikael Åkerfeldt / Opeth; but coming from either direction this is a very strange album. The closest comparison I can make is to some of the more ambient/abstruse parts of Wilson's \\"Grace For Drowning\\", though that is not to be taken too closely. While there are certainly layerings used, the overall feeling is quite minimalist; it took three full listenings before I figured out the songs weren't simply linear compositions. A distorted guitar and pounding drums show up for about two minutes a third of the way through the album; that's about it for anything other than soft and softer. \\"Low-key\\" is far too frantic a label for this album. If you are not an appreciator of avant-garde music in an ambient-flavored line, don't even go here.<br /><br />And yet I find I keep putting it on. It can drag you in if you can tune yourself to it; but I would expect very few will be able to do that - it's just too odd and downbeat. I called this review \\"the fine line between experimentation and self-indulgence\\" because I'm not sure where this falls; but I suspect it is more towards the latter. So I give it a 3-star rating: it is beautifully put together, and it is certainly unique; but given the pedigrees of the artists involved, it is too close to pretentious noodling. But maybe it's not. Your mileage may vary; consider yourself not warned, but clearly cautioned.
B005HEDLGO|5.0|This episode is forever in my memories.  As a social worker it is imprinted in my code of conduct and the ethic of my profession. I totally recommend it for what it is a treasure of Star Trek.
B005DI994W|5.0|The Four Feathers remains one of the great classics of British cinema.  An Alexander Korda production (and directed by his brother, Zoltan Korda) that shows what they mean by the expression, \\"They don't make them like this anymore.\\"<br /><br />Filmed largely on location in the Sudanese desert where the story took place, the story follows ex-soldier Harry Faversham who seeks to make up for his believed cowardice by rescuing the three men who gave him white feathers of cowardice.  John Clements gives a lowkey but powerful performance as Haversham.  Other excellent members of the cast are June Deprez (who would next do The Thief of Bagdad), Ralph Richardson, and C. Aubrey Smith.<br /><br />All of the battle scenes with hundreds of extras are incredible.  No computer-generated effects here.<br /><br />The video is very good, with an occasional line and dropout.  The color is rich, though there are occasionally moments that colors outline seems slightly off, looking the way 3D might be if you didn't put on the glasses.<br /><br />Extras include a video introduction by David Korda, the son of the director.  There is also a nice short of the Denham Studios from 1939, in which you can see a few scenes from the movie being filmed. The highlight of the extras is a non-stop, very informative commentary by film historian, Charles Drazin.  If only all commentaries were this well-researched.  Enclosed in the case is a fold-out essay by film critic Michael Sragow<br /><br />Highly recommended Criterion release!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|i like the book.i read all lee child's novels. It was similar to other novels by the author. I like the jack reacher character.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Considering how so many people, and critics, pulled the arms off of John Carter and stomped on him until he was dead, I think it still has some life on Blu-ray.  I don't recall if I read the novel when I was a youngster, but it has a feeling of being pretty true to its source.  I do seem to recall that the novel's character was a civil war soldier who awoke on Mars.  And adding Edgar Rice Burroughs, the original novelist, to the film was a cute touch.  Yes, the film does resemble many other epic FX movies out there, but I thought the special effects dept did an incredible job with the Tharks.  Movies have come a long way in just a dozen years with regards to special effects.  As far as adventures goes, it's a fairly enjoyable story.<br /><br />Part of the problem with the film, though, is the casting.  The leading man is bland, and he and the leading lady never established any kind of chemistry on camera.<br /><br />The 3D in the film looks terrific at times, but then in some him/her two-shots it looks flat.  In retrospect, I am thinking the parts that looked best were those shots processed through a computer (crowd shots, long shots, special effects).  I know there have been some who said the 3D was terrible, but through a pair of passive glasses, it looked pretty good on the whole.<br /><br />The 7.1 audio was excellent.<br /><br />The extras (which are on the regular Blu-ray disc) include a history of the novel to film, a few bloopers (too few), and a day on the set (this was well done and ran about 35 minutes).  Also there is an opportunity to hook up your iPad or computer to look at a second screen of background material while watching the film.  To me, this is something that they should have done on your TV while watching the film.  By moving it to an outlying device, you increase people's frustration and at the same time by putting it to an iPad or computer it cuts out the chance for more than one person to view it at a time.  There was also a commentary which I didn't listen to because the director did so much talking about the film in the disc extras that I was pretty tired of him.
0307742997|1.0|SPOILER  This book was mildly interesting until one character tells the detective, in a  passing, nonchalant way, that a suspect, a doctor who im sure has heard of google,  asked about him  a very strange and unique drug.  The doctor  ends up dead from od of that drug under auspices of author casting him as sicko pedophiles, prostitite hacker up kind of guy who had been found out and commits suicide.  But he wasnt found out at all!  He  was doing good deeds...so why would he kill himself????  He didnt...duh..this is less then half way through the book....so obvious who dunnit...i stopped reading, why bother.... And guess what, i was right!  What a waste of 250 pages...cant believe reviews say this is intricate, keeps u guessing, etc.  What a joke.....
B0086700CM|1.0|I can't run this on my samsung admire. I waited to long for this to be on the android please release another update. It force closes every time I try to open it.
B007MAET4O|5.0|I pre-ordered the vinyl version of this album, so I had to wait an extra two weeks after th album came out until I got it. During that time I purposefully avoided hearing any of the songs so I could hear it for the first time on vinyl, but I did go on amazon to read some of the reviews that people left after getting their CDs and digital downloads, and I was starting to think I wouldn't like the album (I HATE country music) but I got the album a few days ago and I couldn't have been more wrong. A few of the songs have that country \\"twang\\" to them, but it is by no means a country album as some reviewers have complained about. This is the best album since continuum and probably my second favorite John Mayer album ever, second only to continuum. There are some classic \\"John Mayer\\" songs on this album, something that battle studies was lacking IMHO. \\"Something like Olivia\\" comes to mind on that front. There are a few songs that sound alittle country, but it's not like he's singing with a southern accent about his pickup truck or his dog or drinking beer. I like every song on this album, and I mean every single song (again, definitely not like battle studies, where I liked maybe half of the songs on the album). This will likely end up being one of John Mayer's best albums ever. I've barely listened to anything else since I got it. Great work John
B0080CL0HM|4.0|I have never before rented a movie on line.  Amazon made it extremely easy for me to do so.  I was able to rent Bel Ami for 48 hours several weeks before it was shown in American theaters.  I really enjoyed the film and thought that Robert Pattinson did his usual good job along with the female leads.  I did have a small problem with some of the men looking alike and putting names to faces, so I watched the movie a second time and was then better able to tell them apart. The rental price was much less than it would have cost me to see it with a friend at a movie house so I think my rental was very well worthwhile.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|my four and eight yr old loved it and couldn't stop<br />the guesswork kept getting better<br />pretty good even for a free game
0553062182|5.0|This book changed my life.  I was always told that I was too sensitive, and that it was a flaw.  I always thought I needed to \\"get over it\\" and embrace the world in the same way that non-sensitive people do.  By reading this book, I came to the realization that there is nothing wrong with it, that I am just being myself, and I have nothing to be ashamed of.  There's nothing wrong with preferring to read a book at home instead of going out partying at night.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who considers himself/herself to be sensitive.<br /><br />There is a quiz at the beginning of the book to determine if you are sensitive or not.  If nothing else, google it (you can find it online) and if you find out that you are sensitive, take a look at this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|just about one of the best android app that i ever played.The game is addicting and test your reflexes.RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
1400052181|4.0|So interesting and amazing. The doctor was wrong but I am glad he helped so many. Read to learn more.

0345803485|5.0|Everything I expected!!!!  great book to read.<br /><br />Although I am very unsatisfied about how long it took this product to get to me.
0439023491|5.0|I think I liked Suzanne Collins' \\"Catching Fire\\" even more than the first book in the series.  The people are ready to rebel, as they've seen more than enough death and suffering caused by the 'government'.  When President Snow decides to punish the citizens by forcing most surviving Games winners to once again enter the arena for the Quarter Quell, he takes things too far, presses too hard on the downtrodden.<br /><br />Peeta and Katniss will go to any lengths necessary to save one another, if it's in their power.  Plus, Haymitch wants them to make allies of some of his old buddies, which does not exactly thrill Katniss.  Why start a friendship with people she may probably be forced to kill?  Nothing prepares them for what they will face this time.<br /><br />The ending of this book was so much better than where the first one left off.  \\"Catching Fire\\" stops at a point where I'm itching for more, want to see what happens so bad I'll probably start reading the \\"Mockingjay\\" tomorrow.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! Especially, the reading/voice feature. Also. Love the reminder msgs if you miss a few days. 5 min a day...haha...so true,  though. I hope you find it just as rewarding!
B0077SGMXM|2.0|dear devs, this game doesn't work on my HTC EVO LTE. When I launch I can get as far as the splash screen. That's it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game i think it is great for kids that love this movie plus it gives responsiblity to kids  to takes care of the animals!!!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I've listened to this CD now three times, and my excitement and joy that I've felt since the first listen haven't been abated.  Clockwork Angels truly is a multi-layered conceptual work of art.  Geddy's bass playing is very much in the forefront and his virtuosity shines through without coming across as ostentatious and still blends well with the other instrumentation in the mix.  Harmonies and vocal layering are the same: peppered throughout the tracks to accent various different lyrics.  Alex's guitar work is as brilliant as ever, varying from simple to complex, haunting to background, acoustic to distorted with wonderful solos throughout.  Neil's drumming and lyrics are as concise and poignant as always, and the overall concept of the album is just, well, cool.  I'm in love with all things Steam Punk, so I'm biased.  The only thing that prevents me from issuing a 5 star rating is that despite the narrative approach of the lyrics, there are a few instances where it seems that it is not the character talking to us, but Neil himself.  While there is always a part of the author in the character, I think that dedication to the concept would keep the wall between author and reader a little less transparent.  For the majority of this CD, Geddy's high notes are flawless, but as Geddy is getting older, he is losing some control of the upper register of his voice.  It sucks, but it happens.  In the Seven Cities of Gold, the quality of his singing suffers slightly due to the sustained higher range of the vocals. Finally, for some reason, there is no information on any of the tracks.  Everything is listed as Unknown Album, Track 1.  It's a small point and may be nitpicking, but in the digital age, it seems like a gross oversight. Nevertheless, these items don't detract from the overall excellence of this wonderful CD.  It will be in the player for weeks to come, and I cannot wait for the live show!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like spider solitaire and I especially like it on my Kindle Fire.  Moving the cards around on the tablet somehow makes the game fun.  My only quibble is that the Icon on the recently used screen somehow disappeared and I can't seem to get it back.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Wow! Suzanne Collins has done it again. When I finished the first book of the trilogy, I had to buy this one instantly. What is great about this series is that the characters are so well formed and that it has an unpredictable story line. I thought this book was even better than the first.. if that's possible. I couldn't wait to sit down and read every day!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love this game i played it all the time now its a black screen and goes to my home screen. pls help me sovle this prb. otherwise its an awesome game! &amp;-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Is this book really a best seller? I bought this book with my giftcard seeing as it was rated very highly. I was a few chapters in and began to enjoy the romance even though I noticed some failings in the two main characters but kept reading on... until I came to a part of the book where I couldn't read any further. It's not that I don't have an open mind, it's that I don't like reading about sexual dominance. What really stopped me reading was that he began talking to her like she was a little child. The fact that the dominant character is a billionaire is too simple and the strong, yet inexperienced woman is blushing all the time is unrealistic and, to be harsh, annoying. I suppose I can't really review this book as I didn't even make it half way, but the bottomline is is that I couldn't sympathise or relate to either of the main characters and why would anyone read on if they feel that?
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|I was so anxious to see this movie, & it was really good! The product came earlier than expected & was as described. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This trilogy is a must-read for anyone over the age of seventeen. It is splendidly written with it's well-rounded characters, unpredictable story and moral. It is one of those books that you can't seem to put down for too long and hope never ends because it is so good. Every moment spent with this trilogy is like tasting a good meal.. you want to savour every moment.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so much about this trilogy, and thought I'd give it a try.  I was extremely pleased!  I had mostly heard about the sexual nature of this book but was surprised that I was completely bought into the story line.  Yes there is a lot of graphic sexual content, (that made me blush) but there is also a beautiful love story with just the right amount of mystery, and a little danger.  I read all three books in less than a month.  I would HIGHLY recommend these books to anyone who can handle explicit sex with their love novels. Desperately waiting for a 4th book!!!!
B007K3JCAE|3.0|I love Sherlock Holmes, and I love the angle these movies have taken.  In fact, this movie deserves 5 stars.  However, the Ultraviolet digital copy has been ridiculous.  I've tried for almost a week to link my flixster and UV accounts (which took 3 tries to activate due to \\"system errors\\" at their company).  I've received absolutely no replies to my service help requests.  I was initially wary of UV because of all the bad reviews I'd seen, but after dealing with them, I would strongly warn everyone to stay away from any Ultraviolet digital copy.  Question: what do you call a company that takes your money and doesn't give you what you bought? Answer: A scam.  Ultraviolet is a scam and should be reported to the better business bureau.<br /><br />Update:<br />Ok, I finally have my digital copy.  For some reason, signing on to Flixster using my Facebook account allowed me to FINALLY link my ultraviolet and flixster accounts.  After that, I had to download Adobe AIR and then the Flixster Collection App and THEN I could download a digital copy of SH2. In the end, it all seemed very rube goldberg-ish, but I finally got it!  So, In all, the movie gets 5 starts, digital copy process gets 1 star so I'll settle with a 3 star overall rating
B0079J28NW|5.0|I own pretty much every Beatles thing that has ever come along including their Christmas Album from when I was a Beatles Fan Club Member.  I have at least 3 versions of Yellow Submarine, but this newest one definitely is the best.  The colour is now so alive and vivid that I notice details I never noticed before.  The sound track is equal to the last Yellow Submarine release with the 5.1 surround sound - hard to believe they used reel-to-reel tape recorders to capture their tremendous talents.  If you are a Beatles fan, you must buy this Blu-Ray!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I really like this album! The band is very tight. Lots of change ups & tempo changes & some of the heaviest playing i have ever heard rush do. Yes it's a concept album but you can pick any song and just play it. musially i think it is the best album they have ever made. lyrically 2nd best. Under 2112 i would say this is there 2nd best album ever. They are just playing there guts out on this album.It's like there playing while the room is on fire around them. Because of the concept aspect of the album only lyrically it reminds me of 2112. Musically it reminds me of the albums counter parts or snakes & arrows on steroids. Geddy's voice sounds killer on this record & this album show's some of the best music Alex & Neil have ever done together. If you have ever liked just one song rush has done you will like this album.
B005LAIGPA|1.0|I had to walk away from this film as the shaky camera work was giving me a crashing headache. In my opinion this movie is for teenagers, not adults. Incredibly stupid dialogue... If it hadn't been for the camera work, I might have stuck it out, but I was getting vertigo. I cannot understand why directors use this device - maybe I'm too sensitive.
044024630X|4.0|I gave \\"The Affair\\" four stars because there's no way to give it the three and a half stars it really deserves. Also, it did keep me reasonably entertained on an otherwise boring summer weekend. Admittedly, Child does have a knack for making the most out of practically nothing, as far as plots go.<br /><br />Although he's way over the top and hokey to the point of being absurd, Jack Reacher is well fleshed out and impossible not to like in a cartoon character sort of way--as if Child is pulling your leg with this guy's improbably macho antics and you both know it.<br /><br />As usual, Child is too wordy and overly descriptive. In \\"The Affair\\" he apparently thinks it's necessary to remind the reader about a hundred times that it's 1997--pre-9/11--but all this foreshadowing amounts to nothing other than an attempt, perhaps, to justify a totally implausible plot. This kind of thing is vintage Lee Child, but it's also filler, intended to make a short story longer. I could have done without the porn-novel sex scenes and the fact that the women are all incomparably gorgeous. Very 1940's crime-magazine cheesey, plus all the superlatives become tiresome. But then, I suppose spoofy-goofy, tongue-in-cheek \\"cheese\\" might be what Child is really aiming for, whether he realizes it or not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hadn't read a book in 40 years but this trilogy had me reading morning noon and night, thank you for an amazing book!
B005K17RU0|3.0|accurate but won't turn off on exit. can't cancel using task mngr or clearing ram. pretty stupid i have to reboot to get rid of it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is the most useful app for downloading videos. I use wifi at the library to download videos so I dont have to waste my data on videos that are an hour long with a lot of buffering. I can also skip to certain part with out the buffer.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game! A little challenging but you can earn coins to buy upgrades that help you escape monkey demons.<br />A must have!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have had very little. trouble. with this. game - nothing. like. some. others.  Plays great however could not get it to update so I could visit other players.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I received exactly what I expected.  Having loaned a box set of BoB's some time back and never seeing it again, I had to order another.  Everything was as it should be - DVD's work without issue, quality is good, and it comes in a good and rugged tin.  Very pleased.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|I just purchased this, and it is a decent game but if you are playing against the computer you must go around the board the wrong way.  There does not seem any way to change your home to the bottom left! If I am missing something, please speak up.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|[[ASIN:1612130283 Fifty Shades of Grey]]<br />I am not a big reader by any means. Generally it takes me 3 -6 months to read a book no matter how exciting it is. I had just finished reading a book when a friend mentioned Fifty Shades of Grey to me. When I asked her what it was about, all she could tell me is that it is the buzz right now. I came straight home and downloaded it to my kindle. Well, from the moment I started reading I could not put it down. I even loaded it to my iPhone to read whilst at work.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a very interesting character. I am not into the lifestyle described nor know anything about it, but could understand how it became his way of coping through life. There were times that I fell in love with this guy and others where I totally hated him and wanted to grab him and yell at him. He loved you and swooned you then totally frustrated you all at the same time.<br /><br />I loved this trilogy and read all three books in a month. I enjoyed being on the journey with Christian and Ana and even though I predicted a little of what the ending was going to be, it still held me captivated. Although At times i did get a little board of all the sex but I loved the underlying story that Fifty Shades is.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Good Camera<br />The camera is very excellent for me I've liked .. Thank you<br />I have used in my shop as well as control
0446572993|5.0|Will Robie was a sanctioned killer who was the best at what he did and walked away from each assignment with a clear conscious.  The unidentified alphabet soup who decides the fate of everyone else pushes him into one situation he refuses to act on and sends him into hiding where fate, coincidence, or bad time connects him with Julie a kid on the run from her own enemy.  It takes about 5 minutes to find that the same ghost is chasing them both from different directions with the same objective - to eliminate them.<br /><br />Will has no experience protecting anyone but himself and has no working knowledge of what to do with a kid.  When you are getting a crash course in survival, you do or die trying and Julie is going to force him to let her help.  She is smart enough to follow directions and eager to get back to a life she can control even knowing what has blown up her past.  Julie's parents tried to do their best but in the end left her alone with a man she does not trust as her only ally.<br /><br />With shots fired that don't hit their target, moles turning up everywhere, and will desperately trying to figure out who is the master manipulator with all the cash behind this game of chess.  The one key to stopping the violence is figuring out whom the target really is and if the revenge meter has been set to stun or kill.  The pace is fast, the details exacting, and the result of all their work scary.  What Will and Julie uncover cannot only change the course of their lives but everyone that walks the planet as well.<br /><br />David Baldacci knows how to take the facts, write them into a work of genius that will keep the reader unable to put the book down.  The twists and turns in THE INNOCENT are a masterful manipulation of fiction that comes so close to fact it if frightening.
0817439390|5.0|Many things relating to photography have begun to click for me recently and this book started it all. If you don't know why you would shoot in any mode but AUTO, or only have a vague sense of the things you can do by creatively controlling aperture and shutter speed then you will benefit from this book, hands down!<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: your camera doesn't know Jack about taking awesome pictures, in only knows how to get a technically correct exposure. But a technically correct exposure is a far cry from a creatively correct one. There are many possible ways to correctly expose an image, and knowing and understanding those methods will make a night and day difference in your photography.<br /><br />The book itself is an easy read and not too long. Peterson doesn't dwell for too long on any one topic - just gives you the info you need and moves on while remaining entertaining throughout. I find myself referring to various sections often as I've been seeking to improve my photography.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It will absolutely create the strongest foundation possible for you to go an explore the world through your lens. To me, this book was a revelation.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Beginning with Appetite, through the Illusions, & the Incident, to the Snakepit, Velvet Revolver & last outing simply titled Slash, I have followed Slash forever. When I found out he was making a new Album I was like \\"Wow that's awesome!\\" And when I heard the singer was Myles Kennedy from Alterbridge, who I love, I was like \\"Wow that's freaking awesome!\\" So now I am playing it constantly from the opening song to the last it will melt your face off. And if you have extra cash go for the deluxe edition whitch containes 2 bonus tracks & a making of dvd. ROCK ON!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|when I saw Rovio's angry birds amd Pop Cap's Plants vs Zombies, I thought they had it all ... but then I saw this game and I thought wow this is so addicting ive never seen any thing like it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not for the faint of heart very sexually graphic but great story also!<br />Almost done ready for three!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much! It has so many things to keep you entertained...most people think you just run and jump. You can earn coins and buy powerups, and new people too! I actually take time away time obsessing/fangirling over one direction to play this game! can you believe that?!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|nice one. hole in one. plays great, graphics are simple but great.<br />hope there will be a sequel. wish I could zoom out.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This soundtrack is among the greatest collections of redone 80's hits I have ever heard. It features songs by 80's Hard Rock Icons and every single track is truly something else and an absolute wonder to behold...Each one does amazing honor to the original piece and artist and each one also has a new unique feel and stellar individual high to it that passionately stimulates the track, to make it feel almost like a revival or a rebirth of the song as it gives it both new life and an original interpretation that keeps it familar and yet takes it to a whole different new level of show dome of fun and excitement. The song selection is diverse and featuring songs by Poison, Night Ranger, Twisted Sister, Def Leppard, Journey, Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, etc. is among the best Hollywood could do while keeping it familiar enough and appealing to the audience. Beautiful tribute, beautiful songs (never heard Tom Cruise or Catherine Zeta Jones sing!)  looking sweet guys keep up the good work! (:
0345803485|5.0|This erotic thriller is full of twists and turns that keeps the reader on the edge.<br />Part one of the triology sets the stage for Parts two and three.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I really like this series except for how the author keeps killing off characters. I started reading this series before I found out that this is on HBO. I will not be watching the show.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|I like diver's, chronographs and any watch that's self sustained. I usually go for automatics but have been leaning towards solar lately. Like the automatic solar is self sustaining, unlike like the automatic it is bang on accurate. This is a true diver with screw down crowns; all three. With out the screw down crowns it cannot be a true diver. Anyone bothered by the screw down crowns that operate the chronograph is not looking for a true diver.<br />The bracelet is high end solid stainless steel links with a diver extension and the bezel is as good as my Orange Monster. The luminosity is almost as good as the Seiko Orange Monster. This watch really gives you the feeling you get when you wear a high end watch. As a matter of fact I like it better than a 3000 dollar Baume and Mercier automatic chronograph I once owned.
0307957934|2.0|Alexander Hoffman is a brilliant physicist who leaves CERN to develop an artificially intelligent hedge-fund trading system.  Alex' business partner, Hugo Quarry, is the epitome of greed, while his wife Gabrielle is beautiful, artistic, and tragic in her inability to conceive a child.  Someone is trying to kill Hoffman, and his AI system, VIXAL, turns out to be more powerful than he could ever have imagined, so that in the end all he can do to prevent global financial disaster is to set on fire the warehouse that houses the computers on which it runs.  How many more cliché's could Harris have included in this unsatisfying thriller?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was unbelievable! I loved the story line, it made the characters come to life, not because of the erotic side of it but it made me love the sarcasm and how rich this man was.
