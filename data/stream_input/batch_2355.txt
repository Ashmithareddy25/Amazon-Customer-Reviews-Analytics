B005Q1W10A|5.0|The DVD's of Season 2 arrived on time in excellent condition.  We have really enjoyed the series!  Now we can watch the series at our leisure several more times.
B00A4A1KK0|4.0|He is just my style! Great beats great vocal and I love the folksy sound. I would recommend this artist.
B00865P3AS|5.0|I loved 2CELLOS' first album and did not think anything could be better. But IN2ITION is excellent as well, maybe even better than the first. My favorites include Benedictus, Every Breath You Take, and Clocks.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked the book a lot. Some much depth and insight. However, it was very realistic whereas the Harry Potter books were more fantasy. I like my casual reading to uplift me. I get a lot of reality already. But excellent writing.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|What a wonderful CD!  Lots of good music on this latest release.  I'm so glad I purchased it.<br />I would expect nothing less from this great artist.
0142428280|2.0|This is an abridged and was too choppy. I like Follett and the book was probably good but this was<br />Hard to follow.
B007REV4T8|5.0|On par and even better IMO than the first Bond/Daniel Craig movie.  Good gobs of action as well as character development for this iteration of James Bond.  I won't spoil it but for a third go-around it presents good closure to some things and then opens doors for new things...hope Daniel Craig is on track to at least do a fourth and fifth movie before they choose a new Bond.  Highly recommended to add to your collection.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great WW2 series. Watched it on A&E or some cable channel and it was edited for content, language. Watching it in it's original form and it is as gut wrenching as Saving Private Ryan was . Surprised to see that the lead actor is the one in &#34;Homeland&#34;.  He is excellent in both series. Never knew he was British.

1593080484|5.0|I am an avid Austen fan.  I've read Persuasion a lot, more than Austen's other works.  I have not read it in over five years though so I'm a little rusty.  I like Persuasion a lot because I really connected with Anne.<br /><br />Austen's writing is beautiful.  It is descriptive to women's 19th century lifestyle.  Austen sticks with showing a woman's point of view and never wavers.  I really like how she \\"shows\\" and \\"tells\\" us about how women felt.  Other authors now are giving too much \\"tell\\" on what the characters are like and \\"how\\" they feel.  I want to feel there emotion as well as hear it.  And in order to do that it is important give both \\"show\\" and \\"tell\\" in the writing.  Austen's writing is like a guidebook on how to accomplish this.<br /><br />Persuasion's storyline is really good.  I like how Jane created all the protagonists to keep Anne and Wentworth from being happy together.  I enjoyed knowing about all these characters.  The character development is perfect.  That's something, I think, that other people don't grasp well.  Anyone can say \\"it is a truth universally acknowledged.\\"  But without the character development that Austen is known for, then the other author's stories will run flat.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book and Northanger Abbey.  Both are my favorite.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|I'm not a Brit, so I never heard of Cricket before, but after reading Alan's book I now what it is. This book reminded me of watching British comedy on PBS here in the states or should I say, \\"the colonies\\" as we were once called. The book is hilarious and what makes it even funnier is that is comes across as sincere and not intentional. Since I'm from the US even saying \\"Mummy\\" sounded funny to me. The combination of Alan's humor mixed with adventure and a bit of erotica, kept me turning the pages. It was a good read, a fast read, but a very funny one!
0553211978|5.0|Gothic romance isn't \\"Twilight\\" or \\"World War Z.\\"  Gothic Romance creates a terror that is pleasurable and addictive to read.  It draws you in and makes you hunger for more.  Like watching something that you can't look away from, no matter how terrifying.  Horace Walpole and Ann Radcliffe were pioneers of the romantic horrors.  They used superstitions and the unknown to create a suspenseful horror.  I enjoy this kind of horror the most.  It's more haunting and scary if you don't know what is there.  It's like watching a M. Night Shyamalan movie - all suspense and not knowing what or who until the very end.  Gothic Romance writers wrote lovingly about their supernatural.  Walpole created his house with a gothic touch.  Ann Radcliffe was rumored to have been insane and died from the horrors from her stories.  There are of course Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Edgar Ellen Poe, The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux and  Bram's Dracula.<br /><br />Jane Austen wrote satires (mocking) on 18th and 19th century society and the requirements from a women.  Northanger Abbey is a romantic satire on Gothic Romance.  Jane's character is 17 year old Catherine Morland.  Wuthering Heights' heroine's name is also Catherine.  Jane's heroine is obsessed with gothic romance.  I liked how Jane talked about the various popular Gothic Romance writers.  There was no way to know if Jane herself liked these writers.<br /><br />Catherine Morland expects Northanger Abbey to be a haunted Abbey.  I liked how Jane created Catherine's expectations to be silly and over dramatic.  Austen also had Henry Tilney defend his family and himself by saying that they were nothing more than \\"rich English Christians.\\"<br /><br />I really liked this book the most.  It may not be Austen's typical storyline and yet I think this had more storyline and research.  Loved this one.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Well-acted characters, complex relationships issues, and Interesting law cases, what more can you ask for?!  Once you start watching you want to find out what will happen next in the characters’ lives and what new cases the attorneys will deal with next.
1596912863|5.0|I love Austen.  I've reade all her works. It's hard to tell which is my favorite as they are all superb.  My favorite Austen hero is not as hard to name.  It is Mr. Darcy first and Mr. Knightly second.  That said, Shannon's Austenland is an adult book. The main character is 30-ish years old.  So this won't be a typical Shannon Hale \\"young adult book.\\"<br /><br />This is a great chick lit book.  I own the paperback, which I bought in 2008.  I haven't heard of Shannon before, so I had little expectations from the author.  I am an avid fan of Austen's, so I was intrigued by this storyline.  Especially since Mr. Darcy is my favorite hero.  Hale even dedicates the book to Colin Firth, who played Mr. Darcy in [[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]].<br /><br />\\"For Colin Firth.  You're a really great guy, but I'm married, so I think we should just be friends.\\"  - Shannon Hale's dedication.<br /><br />I am sure you have gathered the synopsis by now, so I'm not going there.  Jane Hayes was a likeable person.  When I first bought this to now, I really connected with Jane.  The other characters grabbed me just as well.  The character development was very good.  The romance was perfect.  There was no erotica or uncalled for love decloration.  I liked that it stuck to the plot and kept the main character as an independent New York woman.  I think that the HEA is perfect.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend this.  I also am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|One of the best movies ever made with a great actor who really became Patton. Patton was the greatest soldier their ever was.
B001QJUX24|4.0|Few cowboys could act with a presence like the Duke.  Be lenient of certain move-making things that simply hadn't evolved decades ago, and enjoy the storyline and visual production quality instead.  This is a very good western.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I thought I'd really enjoy the book, but I felt it followed Nelson's normal formula and I knew how it would end when I was only 1/4 through the book.  yes, I did finish it and Yes, it did end as I thought it would.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It isn't a bad read, the sentences and phrasing are sometimes quite lovely.  The setting is idyllic and yet people have all these interior sins/issues that prevent them from matching the exterior beauty they want to project and protect.  This is a study of a small ecosystem that has suffered a major loss, the vacancy which then results in all sorts of personal and community changes to fix or fill this vacancy.  It is an interesting sociological and perhaps pastoral study of how one person's life and death means so much in so many ways to so many people.  However, this is not Harry Potter, the changes are not exciting, they just happen.  No magic, no wizards and no extreme evil to be combated.  Just normal people - evil enough without magic.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I like mystery and it was free.What else do you want to say. I liked it . If I like it that's all you. Need to know if I don't I will tell you why.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This is an amazing book, sad at times. But the author has written it, so fantastically. I would definitely recommend the book. 5/5 :)
1400049628|1.0|I love all things zombie and had been considering getting a survival book; I thought this would be entertaining and possibly dabble in real life survival. It did neither. There are blatant contradictions in which two separate scenarios are by far the best to be in. Regularly, pictures have little or nothing to do with the subject being discussed. Random statistics are thrown out (e.g. only in 1 in 4 zombies is capable of climbing a ladder), which was funny the first time but the author uses it at every possible opportunity. There is typically too little detail to get any useful information. Worst of all, the last 65 (of 247) pages are dedicated to recorded attacks.<br />The book is supposed to be lighthearted, but that does not excuse it being inconsistent, incomplete, excessively redundant, and generally poorly written.

B008OOYALE|5.0|What a great game for all ages.  Raise dragons, breed dragons and nurture them to adulthood. Lovely clear graphics and colourful scenery.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Undoubtedly, Merlin is the best sci-fi series! Although I am still watching this fifth season each episodes by far exceeds my expectations. The performance by the actors and actresses, the location filming, the special effects...all contribute to make this a unique series. One becomes part of the drama and plot. I am at the middle of the season so far but if the rest is like what I have watched so far I am &#34;enchanted&#34;.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Last year, I reviewed favorably the one-plug car charger by Anker. Now, this double plug 18w charger helps even more. My wife has an i-Phone and I have a Droid. So, we can both use this in the car.<br /><br />I had not been aware, until this new product, that a one-plug version did not necessarily alter for different wattage outputs for different devices at different amps. So, this one, the same size as the single-plug, allows dual charges simultaneously.<br /><br />I like the size and shape. It's much smaller than my older one with the giant angled rubber housing and spiral wire to attach to my Droid. It fits into a small space near the car plug charge and as of course the fire-wire must be attached separately (not included), you can keep the plug in the car out of sight.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I got this book because it has more words and meanings than the New Oxford English dictionary. I would recommend this book to any student or any other person who is needing a dictionary. I gave it 4 stars because it has more words and phrases than its second edition.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|it reminded me of being in high school; maybe early college in my experimentation days, but just ok. my friends and i did have some laughs in conversation.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|First off a friendly warning:<br />Disc 3 only has 3 eps on it, though it's labeled Episodes 9-12. Do not worry. The last disc, 4, has the missing ep... the final two parter, though it is labeled Episode 13. Have no clue how this happened, but it's the only thing I had a problem with.<br />*SOME SPOILERS: BEWARE!*<br />The final series of Merlin, in my opinion, left very few questions to be answered, namely the fate of the younger dragon Aithsu. Did Merlin ever go back to Camelot after sending Arthur's body on its way? (Of course there's really no spoiler here, we all know how the legend ends, it's just 'how' it ended for this show that's the mystery, and I'll keep it as such, with the exception of saying keep a box of Kleenex or even a paper towel by your side. I should have used a paper towel. The Kleenex did little to absorb all the tears I shed. Colin and Bradley's performances in their final scenes was what defines the word 'Bromance'. This relationship, above all others in the story line, was the central focus and remained so until the very end. Be prepared. If you are wrapped up in this series, you WILL sob your eyes out.)<br />I have not been so involved in a television show in a very, VERY long time. It was the Bromance that drew me in and kept me riveted. As the producers/creators said, \\"It is a love story\\", but obviously between two clearly straight men. Merlin's love for Arthur is incredibly profound, Arthur's changing from a king who will not listen to his servant into a king that finally does, is as beautiful and breathtaking as the final battle scene when the sorcerer Dragoon makes his appearance. (For those who do not know who Dragoon is, watch the series from start to finish. Trust me, Colin has fun with this version of himself and it's quite evident. ;D)<br />I am very sorry there will be no more of this story-line, but all good legends must come to an end, and sometimes it's as gut-wrenching an ending as it is satisfying (clue here: any show thatbrings me to a sobbing point is worthy of the 5 star rating I give it).<br />Others who complain about the ending I know are only doing so because of the sorrow it caused. Others who have dissected this series and offered their complaints have missed certain elements within the plotting. I had the advantage of watching the series from start to finish within the span of 2 months, not five years, so I was able to keep fresh all the former hints and clues that were given to us. Watch it again straight through and you'll see what I mean.<br />My only two complaints with the writing and acting was 1) Katie's bad habit of dropping her last syllables during her dialogues. Her acting was superb aside from that, but it was that little annoyance that, from the beginning,kept niggling at me and continued to do so throughout the series. Also her inability to maintain the British accent. She fell into and out of it more times than I would bother to count. Other than her speech/vocal mishaps, she played a fantastic Morgana. Her expressions were spot on, her sense of betrayal, even her compassion for Aithsu was compelling. Just wish she'd had a vocal coach to keep her on track.<br />And 2) Gaius's constant pulling his knowledge of 'the Old Religion' out of his hat, as though he were a walking encyclopedia of all things mystical, and his constant refusal to accept Merlin's misgivings at his word. After 10 years of being at the boy's side, and having Merlin's 'funny feelings and suspicions' constantly verified, Gaius still cannot seem to grasp it that Merlin may just know what he's talking about. Arthur's (supposed) inability to do that is understandable... he has no idea Merlin is a sorcerer(Or does he??? see my view on this below), and looks upon him as just a servant. But Gaius? However, that being said, I love the character dearly as when he finally sees Merlin has grown up, he comes across as a father figure who doesn't want to see that happen. Those two things were my only complaints with the series. As for Arthur's being oblivious to Merlin's sorcery, I choose to believe on the side of 'plausible deniability'. He 'knows' Merlin is special, hence his constant need to keep his servant at his side, but if he allows himself to believe that Merlin is of magic he would be forced to deal with him. Yes, in the final magic reveal he shuns Merlin, but only for a while as he tries to wrap his head around the fact. Of course, this is all supposition on my part, nothing to really base it on fact, but I've been a victim of denial myself, so I keep wondering, does Arthur suspect anything at all about Merlin and is he just going into severe denial about it? It's possible. Then again, I'm a hopeless 'bromantic' and never want to see the boys at odds to the point of ripping their relationship apart. So I choose to believe for the best. It's my nature, sue me. ;D<br />I will no doubt watch the entire series again and again. Bromances of this quality are hard to come by, and I seek them everywhere. This one delivered in spades!

B00C0NFMKI|5.0|While I really liked Paramore's first 3 albums, this one really takes them to a new level. On previous albums there were usually a handful of songs that showed flashes of brilliance, while others were easily passed off as filler. Brand New Eyes was the most consistent out of the bunch but still lacked the ambitious spark I always thought they were capable of. A big chunk of their fan base felt like the departure of the Farro brothers was going to be a huge detriment to the group when in reality, it was probably the best thing to ever happen to them.<br /><br />This album is full of diversity and exploration that never existed in the world of Paramore during their first six years as a group. A lot of this might be due to just how young they were when they formed/had big success. They needed time to come into their own, and that along with the big changes they have gone through in recent years has allowed them to grow into an undeniable powerhouse of a band. Elements of Electronica, R&B, Pop, Punk and Folk all flow throughout this record. Hayley Williams and Taylor York have formed a songwriting partnership that could be incredibly good for years to come.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />Now<br />Ain't It Fun<br />Daydreaming<br />Anklebiters<br />Hate To See Your Heart Break<br />Grow Up<br />Fast In My Car<br />Still Into You<br />Future

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This books was so sensitively written yet accurate based on other true orphanage descriptions I've read.  I appreciated her discretion since we are actually all bright enough to get it without the full description some authors feel the need to insult us with.  Ms. McKenna's metaphors and descriptions were amazingly, complicatedly lovely; making you feel like you understood what she was describing.  I stood in awe  of her characterizations: &#34;she was a dedicated churchgoer, devoted do-gooder, and throbbing artery of village gossip&#34;.  har.  Well worth reading.  I hope to see more from this writer.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I feel silly writing a review of any kind for a Neil Gaiman book.  There is a movie that isn't anything like this story so you can't really compare them which might be useful to know.  If you have liked a Neil Gaiman story before then chances are pretty high you'll like this one.

1601251556|3.0|I originally thought that this was a vinyl mat. Shame on me for not reading the description well enough. It was probably the excitement for finding something bigger than the Chessex ones for cheaper that made me almost buy it on the spot. Probably wouldn't have bought it if I had read that it was just card stock. That being said, now that I have it, it does work pretty decent. The fact that you can use any of the three main types of markers is convenient and the size is great. The only other con I can see with this is that the creases are sometimes hard to get down. Weighing it down for an extended period of time works but unless you store it like that, you have to reflatten them every time, unlike the Chessex battlemat which you can just roll up. Worth the price. If you're just starting out DMing and don't want to break the bank I would recommend it, otherwise I would say it's worth paying double for it's Chessex counterpart.

Unfortunately I could not watch it all in one sitting and when I went back the next day after paying for the film and watching the first half, it was no longer available. No record of it even being in my account. ???? I was disappointed. So I feel I did not get my money's worth. Next time I will go to the video store or watch something on Netflix.
1400069289|5.0|This book was very reader friendly and interesting to read. Each chapter uses different stories and examples to discuss how habits are formed and influence our thoughts and actions. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading it again!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This is a monotone level, boring movie with several inaccuracies.  I do not believe that &#34;they&#34; had phones back then where they could &#34;call your Senator, call him several times&#34;.  And after writting his response to the Senate with and pen dipped from an ink well President Lincoln immediately folded the letter and handed it off. I don't think you can fold a letter that quickly without it just smearing making it unreadlable.  This is just a couple of the obvious mistakes in the movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  in fact I am 11 years old and have read it 3 times.  Highly recommended.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|An extraordinary survey of World War II combined with individual experiences. Perhaps I am biased, though I have read extensively, but I believe the author gives inordinate attention to wise British leadership while deploring stupid American policies. In addition, Beevor gives scant attention to the successes and sacrifices of the U.S. Navy, especially the submariners. Finally, he fails to recognize the preponderance of American forces and material in the Western European conflict. I liked the book and recognize the perspective of the author.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Waiting for season three to be free for prime members.<br />Show can be a little dry if you aren't a war or history buff.
B009KYQNSA|5.0|SEXY, sexy movie.  I can't wait to read the book now.  I've only ever seen the edited for Redbox version, so I thought that the unrated would be a nice addition to my collection of movies.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Exceptionally intelligently well written. Unlike most books the author kept my attention throughout the book. Buy it your will like it.

B00003CXC6|5.0|Anyone interested in constructivism will probably love this movie, as you can read it as a philosophical refutation of objective truth. But it does not end there, it is a great movie as well. If you actually have never seen this movie, you should give it a chance, Akira Kurosawa has done a good job, you will love Toshirô Mifune.<br /><br />The technical quality of this DVD release is good, even if I hope they will find a better negative someday.
0307877965|5.0|I have never &#34;read&#34; Mankell before in an audiobook...only in hard or soft cover.  This is a great story...a real &#34;grabber&#34;. The characters are real, with real thoughts and issues.  One of my favorite reads to date.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie from start to finish.  Action was good.  Suspense was good.  Denzel Washington plays a great partying rockstar pilot.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It helps if you have read Pride and Prejudice recently.  Otherwise, it a good (not great) mystery.<br />Looking at the work itself, things get tied up a bit too neatly at the end.  Still, James is a talented writer.  It's a pleasure to read her work.

B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This app is too slow and in a short time you have to start buying coins to keep going. I wouldn't mind buying the coins if I had a chance to actually win some of my money back. This game not worth it, even for free.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book with our book club. We were all on the edge of our seats discussing the crazy woman, the framed man, and the poor people effected in the process. Gillian Flynn is a fantastic author that needs to be read.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's so addictive, and Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses. She's just so great in whatever she plays.
B000FA675C|5.0|At first it seemed silly to have read it in both hard copy and paprback and then to download it to my Kindle. But I really enjoyed the book and having it, helps me remember characterizations, etc. for Brown's later books. I never get tired of rereading passages or even whole books that brought me a lot of &#34;on the endge&#34; of my seat reading enjoyment. Diane (Michael)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is so awesome! I finished watching the first season and ordered the 2nd and 3rd seasons immediately. Great story lines. Lots of drama and mystery!
B004KA9UXO|1.0|I expected better of a Kindle version of a timeless classic. Punctuation and spelling errors are practically on every page. This made for a jarring and unpleasant read. I would not have thought Amazon would sell such inferior quality goods.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|For casual listeners and hardcore fans alike, this album displays Neil in his rawest moments. Stripped to little more than a harmonica and a guitar, Neil's pristine voice cuts the atmosphere in Massey Hall. He has to tell the crowd to refrain from applause as it throws him off. The recording quality is superb. Neil's voice is captured at its peak. Acoustic versions of &#34;Cowgirl in the sand&#34; and &#34;Don't let it bring you down&#34; are perhaps the two strongest moments on the album. The stark production suits the latter track particularly well. There is a consistency throughout that makes this a flowing work of art. The live recording allows for Neil's signature falsetto to really shine. There is vulnerability here. Dedicated fans will appreciate the commentary between songs as Neil gives insight into his writing psyche on &#34;Old Man&#34;. Visions of &#34;big birds flying across the sky&#34; abound as Neil pays homage to Ontario. This work offers more than 70s Neil nostalgia. Its one of his best and a must own.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars: The complete second season came on time and undamaged. it's great to have it now so I can watch it anytime!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have really enjoyed my kindle app. I love it!<br />Wish I had downloaded it sooner. It is great!<br />Love it
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Game is good and will take 20 minutes or so to complete each game, it kills time quickly. Don't like how hard it is to get upgrades and how there is so many pay to upgrade options.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I like his self-titled album, but this one far exceeds it. Excellent. This album is pure enjoyment from Flume to Re:Stacks.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|The game is fun and entertaining but does not have a strong replay value. I got a little board playing it compaired to other games I have played.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Much better than the weather.com app! The features are great. Very easy to read, easy to navigate, and the pictures are a plus also. Great app.
0770435726|4.0|A good read, but not great.  Somehow the characters seemed &#34;flat&#34; despite the character development.  Perhaps secret agents have to look at things dispassionately. I was left without feelings for any of the main characters.  No sympathy, pity, like or dislike.  The analysis of Kate's marriage was intellectually interesting, but it seemed like it was presented from the viewpoint of a detached observer, rather than Kate.  Finally, without giving away any of the story, although the conclusion had a nice twist, it was hard to believe that such a complex plan was conceived and orchestrated by the one particular character it was attributed to.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I didn't want to love this book because the subject matter is dark, but it was impossible to put down and very thought provoking.  Landay's characters could be any of your neighbors,  friends, or (God forbid) your own family.  It's a thriller that calls into questions perceptions of people and relationships.  The story kept me guessing right to the end.  Enjoy!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|It's amazing and simple to use.  Still learning to use the function calculators but it seems easy to use and apply.
0525478817|5.0|If you are a fan of John Green, you will love this book. If you aren't, don't let some of the more \\"negative\\" reviews discourage you. While the main characters aren't traditional teenagers, they weren't meant to be, as they are written as teenage cancer patients who has their whole lives change due to the disease. It is incredibly funny, but serious when it needs to be. You are almost guaranteed to make an emotional connection to the characters as well.
B004N7B8DY|5.0|What is there to say? Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly, 1970's, martial arts, good vs. bad, and some great Bruce Lee quotes. This is one of my all time favorites. If I'm stressed, upset, bored, or just bummed out, I watch \\"Enter The Dragon\\" and after 103 kinutes of Jim Kelly & Bruce Lee kicking bad guy ass all over the island my spirits are lifted, and I'm motivated handle anything life wants to throw at me. Sounds silly, but only Bruce Lee & Jim Kelly are able to acheve this feat. It's a good movie, even if it is seriously dated, and it does live up to the \\" _______-ploitation\\" films of the era - Bruce Lee gets loads of on screen action both indoors & out kicking mens butts all over the place; while Jim Kelly seems to get more action indoors with the ladies.  Who cares? It is just a good martial arts movie with Bruce Lee wisdom to live by in the first few minutes. If you can'd watch it for the entertainment, watch it for the historical influence in the film industry and martial arts.  The entire world knows all about the great Bruce Lee and what he gave us as a martial artist and philosopher, not many know Jim Kelly inspired and encouraged many kids in the black community to pursue martial arts, play sports that they loved (his sport being tennis), and their dreams, while encouraging them to be proud of who they were and where they came from (it was the 70's after all). So, regardless of what is going on in life, I highly recommend putting life aside for a minute and enjoy some kickass film-age!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|good movie wife and kids love it thanks for getting it here so they will leave me alone about watching it thanka
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|like the changeable weights, although I did put all of them in :-)<br /><br />I'll have to learn how to use the buttons for my thumb (alt/shif/ctrl) but can see how that can really improve productivity.<br /><br />nice packaging, great software configuration and very accurate mouse movements.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator, easy to use and the key pad numbers are large, for me this was important. I tried a couple others, for me  I picked the best.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great family movie.  Well done.  My 11 yr old loved it.  I have nothing more to say about it. good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I picked this up based on reader reviews and for once, I wasn't disappointed. Lovely poignant story. Highly recommended. I couldn't put it down.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This movie caught me by surprise.  It accurately portrays how family life really is as mid-life approaches.  It was like looking in a mirror for my wife and I.  I recommend to any married couple that is experiencing challenges in their lives.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I think I'm running out of gas on jack reacher.  Up to this point I've read them all, but I think I'm done.  I've become impatient with reacher growing up and. Deling with the world as it is instead of some fantasy.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Fascinating read. Has so many subtle layers, you'll reread this book for sure. I Thoroughly enjoyed and i highly recommend.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Yeh, I like Oliver stone too, but come on...if I need someone to save the world, am I going to pick a 60something who has been out of service for many years  Not likely, but then again I'm not the president.  With those bozos, who knows.  Another excellent Baldacci story, lots of twists and turns and a good ending.  I like good endings.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Loved the movie, and the songs in it. I gave this as a gift. They loved it too.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|This was a good story with a very nicely described setting.  Thought the whole thing was well done.  Very believable characters.  Not fantastic but entertaining.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I especially like the theme song. The story line is entertaining, with excellent actors.  It played well, no defects. Thank you!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I rented this movie for my daughter and wife to watch on a Saturday night.  We make it into a movie night when my daughter takes an early bath and we sit back, have some popcorn and watch a movie.  This movie had a good story and was very pleasant to watch. If it means anything, my daughter did not want to go to bed after watching this movie.  She was really into it.  My wife and I also liked it so it is good for adults too.  Overall, I liked the movie a great deal and would rent it again if someone in my family wanted to watch it.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I like the talent he has and the earlier songs. He's heartfelt and emotional. I admire that he made it with just a couple of instruments and his voice.
0307346617|2.0|I was really excited to read this book, given my recent interest in [[ASIN:B009NH6AOQ The Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season]].  So I tore into World War Z with a lot of interest, buying it on my Kindle and reading it on a vacation.  The first part was definitely interesting and kept my attention.  It covered the beginning of the Zombie plague, with scores of interviews from people who experienced it, in their words.  Then I kept reading and reading.<br /><br />The book is a collection of interviews, all about different people and how they witnessed parts of the Zombie apocalypse.  As I read on, I figured out that the entire book is interviews.  There is a distinct lack of continuity because of this.  It basically feels like watching dozens of small news interviews, where people tell their side of the story.  Because of this, it's very difficult to actually connect or care about the people in the book.  There are so many characters, that don't return, that it almost felt like reading a bunch of news reports.<br /><br />It got old so I quit reading.  If he had written a coherent narrative, with recurring characters, I bet I would have really enjoyed it.  Instead, I think I'll try [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead:  Compendium One]].  I know the character development there is really good.  Looking forward to the World War Z movie, though.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought it for $ 53 (Shipping was free). It was a deal! I was positively surprised when I noticed how accurate it is! Fisrt gained 1-2 seconds a day. Then I started to not to wear it during nights. I shake it when I remeber if I didn't wear it. Now I believe it loses one or two seconds a day (in 24 hours). It has been more than a week. It never stopped (I haven't left it without wearing more than 36 hours).  Now it is almost 15 sec behind the official GMT which is a great accuracy for an automatic. It is very light and thin. It is like toy! I can't believe how Japanese technology can build a autumatic watch with such small number of pieces inside, thin and light. Speaking of Japanese technology, it is made in Malaysia,not in Japan. It is not hackable but if you turn the screw to the counter clockwise (like setting a prior hour) without moving the hands (just applying enough pressure just over treshold) second hand can't move and you can kind of hack it. I don't know is it harmful to the mechanism though).<br /><br />I think we over pay to hand made, Swiss automatics which has been produced with the same technique for several centuries. I also have a swiss automatic with ETA Valjoux 7751 mechanism (Bulova Accutron Multicalendar). I will compete both of them in controloled experimental methodology :) I will set them at the same time, will wear one of them every day and compete them. I will let you know the result but much more cheaper Japanese automatic with much less parts seems to be most likely winning!<br /><br />EDIT: It is more accurate than my Bulova Accuttron Stratford Watch with ETA Valjoux 7751 mechanism (That one gains a minute in one week)! It loses less than 5 seconds every day but when I shake it hardly for 10-20 second it gains the seconds it lost. After a few weeks (I never let it stop) it is still as accurate as within +/- 1 min range. I don't wear it everday, left it in a vertical position when I don't wear it and shake it if I didn't wear it more than one day.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Very cute movie love the dynamic of the couple and the kids are so funny! The sister character from the previous movie (cathrine heigel) was noticeable missing. Will be interesting to see if a baby movie is next

B00BXU3W6K|5.0|Author Neil Gaiman has earned both critical and commercial success with his original stories and ability to adapt to various mediums. His 1998 novel Stardust is perhaps his most famous work. With the story released as a serialized comic, graphic novel, novel, and film adaptation, Gaiman's Stardust has obviously connected with audiences around the world. After years of seeing the novel in book stores and hearing positive comments about Gaiman, I decided to finally read the story for myself. The beautiful gift edition of the novel, that I had the pleasure of reading, instantly sets the tone for the \\"grown up fairy tale\\" that you are about the read. It is a bound, hardcover version that is made to look as if it is very old and well loved.<br /><br />The story itself immediately begins with a timeless feel. The novel begins in the city of Wall. Literally, the city lies within the confines of a large wall. Only one opening exists in this structure, and it is diligently guarded by the local men of the town. Insiders are let out of the city every nine years when a traveling market sets up in the meadow outside of the city. Outsiders rarely enter Wall, and so the people of Wall live a peaceful, but sheltered life.<br /><br /> We learn of young Tristan who is, like most young men his age, madly in love with a girl who wants nothing to do with him. As he walks the young Victoria home from the store at which he works, he begins to plead for her love, offering anything he can think of in return. As this kind of pathetic attempt continues, the two notice a star shooting across the sky. In a final plea of desperation, oddly similar to the scene in the film It's a Wonderful Life where George offers Mary the moon, Tristan offers Victoria the Star in exchange for her heart.<br /><br />So begins the magical story of Tristan's journey to recover the fallen star. Of course, he is not the only one who is searching for the star. As he exits the safety of wall and embarks upon this fantastic voyage, he comes into contact with evil witches who long for their lost youth, embattled princes who fight for the rights to their father's throne, and a strange merchant lady who may hold the answers to Tristans mysterious past.<br /><br />Gaiman expertly captures the timeless feel that all good fantasy stories have. His characters are all unique and Tristan in particular is one who you can't help but root for. Rather than try to forge a story with all original content, Gaiman embraces the history of the genre and simply puts his own style into it. From beginning to end, this story held my interest, and kept me genuinely invested. If I had to make any complaint, it would be that the ending could have been fleshed out a bit more. Other than that, this is a masterful display of storytelling that is everything it sets out to be.tic voyage, he comes into contact with evil witches who long for their lost youth, embattled princes who fight for the rights to their father's throne, and a strange merchant lady who may hold the answers to Tristans mysterious past.<br /><br />Gaiman expertly captures the timeless feel that all good fantasy stories have.

B006UUK612|4.0|Great movie for the kids to watch. This is back when things at Disney were still clean and though it's from the 80's (a Disney dry spell) it's still a good little story the younger kids will enjoy. My 8 and 4 year old enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a fun train game to test your ability of jumping sliding and clicking game. its cool! that is why i have rated it a 4 star.i could be a bit more easier and let you have more live chances
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|It has held up well and the story is good but it is still showing it's age at times. It's one of the first CGI movies and that has kept the dinosaurs more believeable over the last 20 years unlike your old king kong's, etc. It' entertaining and I wouldn't mind seeing a 3D version.
B005OZ4E3A|5.0|I have been a Laura Pausini fan since the early 2000s and I have quite a number of her albums.  So when I heard this album was being released, I wanted to add it to my collection.  I recently got the chance to purchase this item and I am glad that I did. All of the songs sound great and Laura sounds great, too.  I definitely recommend this CD to any Laura Pausini fan.  I am also looking forward to purchasing more of Laura's albums in the future.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Every so many years I like to see this. I watched it this time and forgot about some of the curse words and sexually suggestive language, with my 8 and 4 year old watching with me. They pointed out the bad words quickly. They know better so we continued to watch. Though it doesn't instill the &#34;great adventure&#34; feeling it once did for me...I hoped it did so with my kids and the oldest liked it and wanted to watch again.
1476712042|5.0|one of my favorite books next to Collide. Would definitely recommend this book and would read it again along with Walking Disaster.
0937381888|3.0|I bought the Kindle version of this book and returned it.  The charts, graphs and pictures do not format properly with larger fonts selected, and parts are badly clipped off. Seems to be a good book and I will probably spend another dollar and buy the paperback.

B0028AQLYE|5.0|I enjoyed using my Finis snorkel, but found that water was getting into it occasionally.  That was why I bought the snorkel...so that I could avoid breathing water.  I decided to buy this dry top and was surprised by how well it works.  I read that it slightly reduces the airflow into the snorkel, but I didn't experience any noticeable reduction in air at all.  It does keep water out of the snorkel, which enables me to keep swimming instead of having my concentration interrupted by water getting in.  When I received it, I tried to put the top on without running hot water over the snorkel and the snorkel top (like the directions suggested).  When I did submerge both in hot water, the top slipped right in.<br /><br />In my opinion, this upgrade to the snorkel makes a world of difference in an already great product.

B000K3HTRY|4.0|Perhaps not for everyone, but this film touches the surface of some people's need for control, or to be controlled, ultimately expressed through sexual desire. While there is some nudity and suggestive sexual scenes, it is tasteful, in my opinion - no porn here. What I liked about it was how well James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal played their roles - you could really see the internal torture and need in their expressions. Most people want to feel normal, but this film recognizes that we are all unique, and through the other characters in the film, we see that nobody is really \\"normal.\\" It's a like-able light romance-comedy-drama with a good musical score as well.
1416972242|5.0|these are a great series of books.  really have kept my attention--something different.  try them!  bought first one, and i was hooked!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A heartfelt story that changes the way one looks at &#34;transitioning&#34; to the other side. Factual, scientific worlds mix with the unknown.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall definitely ranks as one of the very best Bond films produced. It is obvious that a lot of effort was put into the making of the film in all aspects. The only thing that was a little disappointing were the Bond girls -- not that great as characters, and not overly important to the movie as in previous films. Moneypenny was fun, however. The villain is one of the biggest creepers to ever appear in a 007 production, and Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond, even though he's not my favorite actor to play in the role. I particularly liked the Komodo dragon scene...

B006M6NV0M|5.0|My dad wanted this one for Christmas, but didn't specify which one... So I bought both just in case I messed up.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Better than play because plot easier to follow if  u r not familiar with it.  Scenery and sets outstanding.  Use close captions to follow and understand all the words to the music.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show to come along in awhile. Always has you on the edge of your seat.you never know what could happen next
B001KX50BK|5.0|My mom and I absolutely love this movie. So I bought it. And got it on blu-ray just to build my collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is super addicting you can never put it down you are always getting money you can connect with friends from facebook.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|I don't know what it is about this one, I generally don't get so into action movies much, but I think it's the ongoing humor element that attracted me and I just had to own it.
B005P3NPXG|4.0|I am a child of the 60's and grew up with R&B running deeply in my blood.  The Motown greats were far more to me than the boys from across the pond.<br /><br />I first discovered Seal when I heard \\"Kiss From a Rose.\\"  I was instantly smitten.  His voice has such incredible depth, range and emotion.  He sings to my soul.  When I saw him as part of \\"The Hit Man Returns\\" (David Foster's review) I was almost reduced to jelly.  If you haven't heard his duets with the late, great Donna Summer (\\"Unbreak My Heart/Crazy/On the Radio\\" Medley) I highly suggest them to you.  The two of them simply rock together.<br /><br />I give this CD four stars simply because I'm not sure it's a adequate platform for Seal's great talent.  I want to hear more of the kinds of things that graced his first albums -- things like \\"Crazy\\", \\"Kiss from a Rose\\", \\"Prayer for the Dying\\".  Time for some more Dynamic Seal.<br /><br />Having said that, I still can listen to this one over and over.  I especially like the opening cut (Wishing on a Star) which I don't ever recall hearing before this album.  I think Marvin Gaye would be well pleased with his rendition of \\"What's Going On\\".
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm not saying it's a perfect adaptation, but it's still a fun movie. And the writing is so Whedon. I had to own it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It was great.  I have loved every minute of each season.  I would not miss one show for anything. Looking forwards to many more shows.
0062200909|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift, I really haven't heard about it since but I'm hoping he likes it.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm so excited to have this show available on Prime! Its so hard to catch up on CBS shows because they so rarely end up on services like this so I'm glad this one made the cut!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love playing this game.  My son loves zombies and he likes this game also and I play it every day
161218412X|4.0|This is a very well-done presentation of Sherlock Holmes, with very nice volumes(4) and excellent packaging with an ingenious slipcase which closes magnetically.  The only reason I have any criticism is the illustrations, but it's not that they aren't numerous and essentially well-done.  I am a long-standing Sherlock Holmes fan and the illustrations are a bit too 'modern' for my taste and not as traditional in the line of Sidney Paget's.  But that is a personal taste.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|get this at a way better price then any other place get it for my husband that is a chuck junky . he has all of them .
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is just a classic that cannot be passed up. A must have for the avid music listener. You will not be disappointed with this album as it is a unique genre within itself and worth every penny!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|get this to go on my pandigital to read my book to me . works great . kind of the same form as the kindle 3 wifi does . love it .
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I didn't get to see it when it was out so I waited stiil I could buy it and it was awsome in my opinion.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The writer of this book did an awesome job relaying the life of Adam Brown through the eyes and story's from his family, friends and unit members. I felt like I was on the sidelines watching Adam Brown's life and the changes he made to become the hero he was.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great vacation book.  It was a quick read with a little bit of everything ... Romance, suspense, and thrill!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is what is making PBS so popular these days! Season 3 was so filled with emotional happiness and turmoil. It really draws you into the lives of the people, whether upstairs or downstairs! I always find myself so thankful that I didn't  live in that time period!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Im definitely going to read the rest of the series, good humor and characters. so many words words words....why does the word word not count.....
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Served a dual purpose - I learned a great deal about early onset Alzheimer's while also being able to relate to the characters as if they were my own neighbors or family members. Would be a discussion-rich book club choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a fun game. i play every day. its a nice traditional game. there's nothing I would change! download it now!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed it from begining to end.  It is full of wise reflexions about life itself.  I would highly recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's always easier to cope when you know your not alone. And books like this help us to realize that we are not alone.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|The ending was not what I expected.  I love the animal work and the intensity of emotion that this movie brought out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were very interesting,kept me wanting me to know more. I sure hope these three are not the end. So many readers would love to know more especially how the saga ends. Never leave a reader wondering how things work out, please write more on how they turn out.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The stories that are so intertwined in this series keep me on edge.  You learn to love the strengths visible through all the struggles.  There are some VERY surprising turns of events!  It makes me wonder how far civilization has really brought us...the brutality still exists today, sometimes...but not always in more subtle forms.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 5 times and sometimes it is hard to view.  But I wanted a copy of it to be reminded of what Christ did for me.
B00280LYIM|5.0|this was a really great book like all the others. lots and lots of surprises. i like  how your book use real legends and myths
6304578458|5.0|I LIKE THE ACTORS AND THE PLOT.  IT HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE SINCE I RECEIVED IT AND SAW IT AGAIN.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really like the adventure in this book and I would like to get the rest of the collection!!! I like the great description in the story too:)
B0035QUXWQ|4.0|Even though some of the special effects are lame as heck. This entire movie is a treat compared to the majority of stuff released around it. I sometimes watch this movie as a feel good sunday afternoon interlude.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Yes, I am an adult and I bought this one for myself!  I watched it with my niece on HBO or something once and just HAD to get one for myself. It is an awesome feel-good movie and you won't go wrong buying this one!
B008602KQI|4.0|I think every one of my children went through this entire series and loved it. I would recommend this to any teen.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Requiem has a good plot and some great moments but I was disappointed in the action level and the ending. I thought the first two books were better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This story is great so many levels. The social relationships, the end of the world as we know it angle, the personal relationships. It all works. I also like that they are willing to knock off anybody at any time. Look out Rick! you day is coming.
B001HN6922|5.0|My 2 year old grandson loves Cars and this movie is funny and the animation is awesome. Would recommend this movie.
B00000IREA|5.0|I find \\"Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy\\" to be a psychedelic, costume, music, metal teeth doll, Jane Fonda and shag fun fest.  This 1968 film was made after the French comic books Barbarella by Jean Claude Forest which the movie in my opinion does a good job of giving you an almost comic book feel.  Most will likely find the special effects to be of low quality, especially if you prefer the special effects of today.  I however, find them to give all the more comic book feel of the time and enjoy the psychedelic appearance of many of them.  The film was directed by Roger Vadim who was also married to Jane Fonda at the time.  In short if you like 60's \\"B\\" movies with the features I describe in the first sentence this film might be for you.  If however, you don't like 60,s \\"B\\" movies and the items I mention in the first sentence you will likely disagree with my five star rating, so be warned.
B0036FOGTW|5.0|I recommend this to anyone looking to get an alternative view on international development and the role aid plays in it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|The movie was amazing! The art work was gorgeous and the characters where so fun. You could relate to each one. The story line is touching and the lines are funny. Wouldnt recommend it to ypunger children but great movie for 8+.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|If you love the television show this then is a must read.  See the whole story from the beginning.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|Would not recommend this movie for young children! It is kinda dark later on in the movie but other then that the story line is interesting. The animation and art work is STUNNING! The characters are well thought out and interesting. Good for a movie night.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|If you've read the Aubrey books you'll probably find yourself correcting the movie which is really more of a new story with incidents and themes from several books put together. Try to forget that and enjoy the movie itself. The detail, photography, action, and the whole range of emotions are crafted together in this amazing movie! The soundtrack is worth purchasing as well!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was Amazing! The movie is great for a sequel especially a 4th. The story line is interesting and the new characters are interesting. Has all original characters and all very fun. This is good for the whole family.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When it is easy to picture what the writer is saying and  thinking about it days after it's finished tends to mean that it was an excellent read.
B00A83075M|5.0|This movie was heart warming and sweet. the Animation was great. Each character has a life of their own and wouldn't be the same with out them. Lines of this movie are hilarious and is great for children of all ages. The story line is touch and keeps you interested. Worth ever penny.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I read this book on my kindle<br />All I can say is that I really really enjoyed it and was glad to have watched Series One on TV<br />I will definately read Book 2 and watch Series 2<br />I heard Series 3 has begun on American TV so I guess I will be reading Book 3 as well !!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Only thing I don't llike is that you always start from the beginning and have one life. There's no checkpoints but I have to say I'm addicted. But it will be a cold day in he@@ when I actually buy coins. Lol
B004PYD77K|1.0|my dvd player wont play and neither my computer, as instructions but i dont know what to do with it now...
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have edited this review to remove errors and better reflect my feelings on the material being reviewed.<br />This book isn't perfect but once I got into it I couldn't stop reading.<br />The author did take a few characters in a different direction that I expected, but they are his characters, not mine.<br />One of the things I love about this series is that most of the characters are both good and bad, flawed with redeeming qualities, and you can love or hate almost all of them.<br />Martin writes with many point of view characters and this enables us to follow action in many locations, and from different sides of the same conflict. I feel that he handles this very well. I read a book by Stephen King where we were forced to witness the exact same scene from the POV of five or more different characters.  That is very annoying. To this point I can only think of one scene that Martin wrote from two POVs.<br />He is a wordy writer but for the most part it only serves to enrich the story.<br />While reading Martin's writing I still feel that he is in control of the story, rather than letting the story control him. Some of the smaller story lines are starting to come together, giving us hope that more questions will be answered in future books.<br />Martin has created a vivid world filled with interesting people and I will keep reading as long as the books keep coming.<br />(I do feel that we could do without the graphic sex scenes involving underage girls.)<br />Otherwise I have no complaints about the book, or the series and can't wait to read the next one.<br />Bring on the dragons!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book deserves a five, but I gave it a 4 only because I ended up skipping paragraphs because the author would describe things to such great lengths. It slowed down the story's momentum. Great story nonetheless.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Life is good when you can see the numbers,very handy and the kids love it as much as I do.
B003MC5N28|4.0|this book was very short. it was heart felt though. I enjoyed it a bunch. It was sad that they would kill the old and the infants. But I guess they didn't know any better. I would recommend this book to people who like system like community.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|It was an ok movie . I liked all the actors. I would no of named it morning glory though.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I can only give a review on the service.  I ordered the DVD it came in great condition - like new and arrived promptly.  The DVD was not for<br />me I only forwarded it on to someone who was interested in watching it but is in a Rehabilitation home.  Sorry I can not be of further help<br />As far as service I rate you 5 star

B003VANOFY|1.0|I'm a little over a year into owning this item, and the device no longer takes a charge.  So I looked it up and saw that it has a 2 year warranty.  I contacted Logitech, and I told them that I purchased it through Amazon.  They asked me to send a copy of the invoice and that they would then send me a prepaid envelope to return the item, after which they would send me a replacement.  I thought this was all well and good, until I just received an email say that:<br /><br />&#34;Unfortunatley your G930 is not under warranty since it was purchased from a 3rd party seller.&#34;<br /><br />This is just plain unethical.<br /><br />Two lessons learned here:<br /><br />1.  I will never buy logitech items again.<br /><br />2.  I will never buy 3rd party seller items from Amazon.  If it doesn't say &#34;Shipped and sold by Amazon&#34;......the risks far outweigh the benefits.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I loved it but as always, it left me hanging,don't know when the rest of the journey will take place,so that makes me sad that I have to wait.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Funny how I actually play this while on the subway to/from work.<br />As I said in the title...It's pretty much ridiculously fun. I know some find it boring cause there is no true goal, but who cares lol. It's entertaining.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|What can I say. It was a great movie. I love me some Tommy Lee Jones.This one is a must see if you are a fan.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Paramore expresses new styles of musical ability. Although their style has been altered, they still hold on to their rock genre.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is very scientific and detailed, but that is what is great. It is a very different read than many sci fi books, Reminded me of Quarter Share a bit for its clean cut approach that doesn't suffer at all from lack of extreme violence or evil (and I like that stuff too). Just battling the true &#34;elements&#34; and all that that entails. Endearingly written and a great main character who exemplifies &#34;never give up!&#34;.

B002SRQ214|5.0|Fast Fast. Upgraded from an athlon II x3 435.  synthetic benchmarks blow it out of the water (roughly 4 times the performance).  for $75 i get ivybridge i3/FX 8140/6200 gaming performance (my goal was gaming) for almost half the price.  uses more energy, runs a bit hotter.  but a good selection for a legacy board nonetheless.<br /><br />with the stock fan it hits 60C at full load, overclocked to 3.7ghz it hits 65C, i don't want to go higher until i get an aftermarket heat sink.  idles at 30C.<br /><br />stock heatsink can get loud on full load.<br /><br />this well serve me well until Haswell and my next mobo arrive.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book was heart wrenching and heartwarming at the same time, and I'm actually a little disappointed that it's over.  Rainbow Rowell is a master of making the mundane glitter with significance, as it often does.  Such a feel good novel!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book needs to come with a capital letter warning that tissues are essential.  The sadness never ends.  I found some of the situations overly dramatic, and not believable.  Examples would be the nursing mother incident and the ability to nurture a flower bed while being homeless and sleeping in the bushes.  Another example would be the main character's flower business growing so quickly.  It takes more than a few months (length of pregnancy) to build a business. I'm glad I read it, but could easily have lived without it.
B002HSSAY6|1.0|We didn't even finish watching it. It was long and drawn out! Don't waste your time in ordering it to view. There was very little plot. And Bronson's harmonica tune was annoying.
B000FA675C|5.0|Definitely a great fun read.  Highly recommend it.  Much better than his other books.  Hope the next one is as good.
030759565X|1.0|I got this cookbook as a gift over the holidays and several months later never find myself reaching for it. I have followed her blog for several years, so I thought I would enjoy the book. When I first flipped through it though, I noticed right away that there were very few baking/dessert recipes. Given that her blog has focused so heavily on that, I was surprised. And there weren't any other recipes that I felt really excited about making.<br /><br />Eventually I did find two or three recipes that I thought would be worth trying. The first one I tried was the \\"Vinegar Slaw With Cucumbers And Dill\\". I immediately found the format and layout of the recipe to be hard to follow while cooking. I was then annoyed to see the recipe wasn't as precise as I would expect. Saying to 'thinly slice or shred' the cabbage wasn't helpful. I ended up using the food processor and guessing at which blade to use based on other recipes for slaw that I saw online. Then the recipe said that the salad would keep, covered in the fridge, for a week. However, it didn't specify if you were meant to leave the liquid around it (which was mostly vinegar) or drain it before storing. After two days in the fridge, I found it horribly sour and threw it out.<br /><br />Overall, not impressed with this book. I will likely be selling/giving away this book soon.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Any scene in Stephen King's \\"It\\" that features Tim Curry as the evil, shape-shifting clown Pennywise is sublimely scary--particularly his first appearance, which will make you jump out of your seat. The rest of it, unfortunately, is a standard-issue TV-movie, not bad but not distinguished or even particularly frightening. Richard Thomas and John Ritter give decent performances, and Richard Masur makes the most of his few gory minutes on screen. But the other adult actors get annoying after a while, and the ending is frankly lame compared with the scenes of Pennywise. Of the child actors, the best by far is Jonathan Brandis, playing Richard Thomas' character as a child. It is unbearably sad to think that Brandis hanged himself a dozen or so years later, just as it is unbearable to think of River Phoenix's fate after seeing \\"Stand By Me.\\"<br /><br />The plot of \\"It\\" bears a definite resemblance to that of \\"Stand By Me\\"--particularly the themes of the vicious teenage gang threatening the smart, nerdy kids and tne general lack of empathy among the adults. 'It\\" introduces the idea that Pennywise's influence has made the whole town mean, but it doesn't develop that theme. I have no idea whether King developed it more in the book, but I can't help but notice that the Maine townspeople in King's books tend to be cold and cruel in general, much like the nasty New Englanders in Shirley Jackson's books. I don't know if King can be accused of stealing from Jackson on that count, but between the stories of those two, it sure doesn't make me want to visit New England!<br /><br />The extras on the DVDs are sparse, consisting only of commentary by the director, Tommy Lee Wallace, and the cast. \\"It\\" is a competent thriller--and more than that when Curry is on screen--but it's not one of the best adaptations of King's work.
B000FA675C|5.0|Really good book. Although I like more Angels and Demons, this is an excellent second adventure by Robert Langdon. =)
B00013F35I|5.0|Found this and will never turn back. Just fantastic. If I have a fraction of the joyfull energy that they all have on stage...well...wow...I'd be so lucky. Complete satisfaction and awe. I am ordering a few for friends who never heard of him.....
0553801473|5.0|After the somewhat disappointing fourth book, this one was much better.  Would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys the series on HBO.
B000002BPS|4.0|The Offspring is a very catchy punk rock band that fuses hair metal with punk rock to make a cool and unique sound.You really should buy all of the offsprings music if you like music that isn't serious.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Amazing first season and got me hooked enough to read all of the current books which took me a good six months to do!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was so good that I couldn't put it down.  A true story of survival in the worst situation imaginable.  Loved it!
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm trying really, really hard not to start this review speaking in tongues, and it's proving to be really difficult. My emotions, thought processes, hormones, sensory perception, it's all coalescing into an utterly rampageous, volatile ball that's going to leave a mess everywhere when it pops.<br /><br />GIDEON!!!!!<br /><br />Ah, God, how am I going to survive the images now etched into my brain? Oh, and let me say this before I go any further:<br /><br />Yes, there are similarities between Fifty Shades of Gray and this BUT, no, they are not the same. No where near it. As a fellow author, I strive my hardest not to say anything negative about a story (hence, why you won't see any negative C.W reviews. If I don't have anything positive to say about a story, I simply won't review it.).<br /><br />But I must state that Sylvia Day and E.L. James are two completely different writers, and while both have their own \\"talents\\", Ms. Day's are beyond what most writers can accomplish. The way this story ripped out my emotions, my passions, my insecurities, and flung them on the floor for me to sift through? Yeah, that's not just talent, that's sheer genius.<br /><br />I said it.<br /><br />And Eva stands up for herself from the beginning, which in this world of lovesick/weak women, I advocate 100%. And although they're both equally messed up, Gideon also bends for Eva as much as he demands. The man refuses to let her go.<br /><br />The way he wants her, the way he chases her, the way he TAKES her...<br /><br />Yeah, I had to go bold, caps, and italics on that one. Because I've been ruined by Cross, and I'm officially addicted to Ms. Day. Did I mention that this was another book I re-read like 8 times before I actually had time to sit down and write this review?<br /><br />That good people, that good. No, forget that. We're talking prodigious. Amazing on a damn-near unprecedented level that cannot be explained or even properly understood until you go experience it for yourself!<br /><br />Now go! I have book 2 whispering seductively in my ear.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had never watched the series before.  After watching season 1 I quickly went through season 2 and am ready to begin season 3.  I can't get enough of this series. Thanks for making it available on Amazon Prime for no cost.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Did I say part one emotionally wrecked me? Oh hell...if so, then after reading this book I should just admit myself to the hospital. Like now.<br /><br />I read this whole book in one sitting and the entire time, my heart was beating so hard that my sister (who was sitting next to me reading it, too) saw it hammering away through my shirt.<br /><br />That powerful I say!<br /><br />This book is beyond what I would call an emotional rollercoaster. I swear to everything holy, I'm sure I need therapy after this!<br /><br />And a love life. Let's not forget that one.<br /><br />This book was as equally hot as book one and perhaps ten times more intense. I was so worked up that I wanted to fling my tablet at the wall HOURS after I was done reading it.<br /><br />And what Gideon did at the end? Call me crazy, it's true, but he hooked me forever. I shall never be satisfied with any man until...LMFAO!!!<br /><br />I'm counting down the days 'till book 3. Just can't breathe thinking of owning the next one.
B000ICXQUQ|1.0|This film is dialogue heavy with everyone &#34;thinking out loud&#34;, long slow, plodding pace for the storyline and flat acting.<br /><br />My son had to watch it for  a Film Class.  Too bad it wasn't a good example of expert storytelling.<br /><br />Sorry guys.  At least there wasn't a sequel!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|the book The Wizard of Oz is just as great as the movie, with a little extra added adventures and crazy things!
B007712XAU|3.0|The story is OK as expected.  We were disappointed that the discs did not play on our TV DVD ( admittedly old) but I read somewhere on Amazon that Roxio and windows media player used together might solve this problem for us and it did. My wife, however, was expecting to be able to sit back in a comfortable chair ( does not describe our computer chair) and enjoy the programs.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is like a master cook. After intense research he gathers piles of data and pokes, seasons and creates  a believable  yarn. Even if you don't have a passion for fun puzzles, you will still have a great time getting caught up in the action.
034580404X|5.0|i have read the first one and loved it.  cant wait to read the other two books.  plan to start very soon.
B004RZGUBM|3.0|Throw out all those writing rules you learned in high school, kids, Dickens is here. Hundred-word sentences and thousand-word paragraphs are made even more difficult to navigate thanks to the E-book conversion, which sprinkled numerous typos throughout the collection. All of that aside, Charles Dickens created some of the most memorable characters in fiction history.  Twist, Scrooge, Nickleby, Uriah Heep, Copperfield... Whew!
1419701533|4.0|this was a christmas gift for my 12 year old son, he has loved the series of books and now he has his own set.  he was previously checking them out from the school library.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|This release is everything it should be: crisp, clear transfer of the movie with several different versions available.  The film itself is certainly charming (else I wouldn't have bought it).  Great for kids, and quite popular with a burgeoning adult fanbase as well.  Well worth the watching.
B0067R0APK|1.0|So Inaccurate! How dare they use accuse in their name!NEVER TRUST THEM! THEY WILL PREDICT A FOOT OF SNOW AND WE WILL GET 50DEGREES AND RAIN!!!
0756405890|5.0|I love fantasy and can never seem to get enough of it. Sometimes I enjoy a book and sometimes one will seem just like the rest. Then comes one that stands out from the rest and you know that this is one you'll treasure all your life. This is what I felt about The Name of the Wind. I put off reading this book because it was so long. I have very little time to read even though I enjoy it immensely. So I have to be choosy on which book to read next. Well I finally picked this one and my only regret was not picking it up sooner. What a gem! Not since I read Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series have I been so captivated.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent writing. I  was so engrossed in the story I  found I could hardly put it down to go to bed. I finished the book in record time..
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|the package is broken  a little bit<br />but as a MJ fans/<br />this vinyl is very worth buying ~<br />love the king of pop
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very funny! Great story! Great voice cast! Great for the family! This movie was very entertaining and featured a lot of loved arcade games that we all grew up on.
0307716988|5.0|AS A MJ FANS<br />I THING ALL OF US SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK CAUSE MICHAEL WROTE IT BY HIMSELF<br />IT;S WORTH BUYING~
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The only way you should watch this movie is in high definition because the colors and scenery are brilliant. I know a lot of people do not like musicals and you should know that this movie is sung from the beginning through the end. However, I think the whole movie was very entertaining, eye and ear pleasing.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this app keeps failing after a day of play it says app not installed. it needs to be reviewed urgently
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. This was the worst movie since napolean dynomite. And that is hard to contend with.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I bought one for me. Visited a friend in Ca who liked it so I gave it to her. I just replaced it for myself.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Morning Glory was very entertaining.  Harrison Ford's character was very well portrayed.  It was an enjoyable movie to watch with the family.
B001PB3NWK|5.0|The makers of this movie did an outstanding job.  I was able to do further research through this movie because its authenticity was so well preserved.  The actor Piotr Adamczyk did and outstanding job invoking the Pope John Paul's holiness and love for others.  I was very impressed with his performance.  Thank you (Makers of the film) for doing this movie.
B002JIEYLW|2.0|I didn't purchase this particular cd thru Amazon as I already have a copy of a \\"remastered\\" Vol 4 cd. This has always been the poorest production of all of Sabbath's albums, and that is a shame because it ruins enjoying some pretty darn good songs. Even the so called \\"remaster\\" is terrible (I can't tell it's a remaster). Until someone comes up with a true, quality remastered version of this album, I will avoid replacing it.
B0058W74UY|2.0|I downloaded this for my daughter Kindle Fire HD and it does not work.  I can not find any flash player to work with it.  This prevent her from playing many games and learning web sites.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I like this type of story. The story was good, action etc. The characters were interesting. I think it would make a great movie.
B002NVELDQ|4.0|I found Mad Men Season 1 very entertaining but not something I feel I need to rush back to see the next episode
B005LAIHZY|5.0|A great movie about family, and devotion would recommend it to any one who ha any pride in their Scottish heritage.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Fun...doesn't always work well...annoying pop-up advertising to suck you into paying for additional variations of the game, some of the buttons don't work unless you pay for them
B00BI745AA|3.0|Slow at first, singing is certainly not like the NYC stage play. I did finally get the real meaning of the story which I missed in the play.
B000059MEK|5.0|It easily became my favorite CD until Random Access Memories got announced, no songs from the new CD have been released yet but I'm so pumped!
B008EQIJQO|5.0|loved it, loved it,loved it. What a poetic performance. glad to be a poet after a movie like this. ok
B009IEXKXI|5.0|All the story is amazing, the supporting data, the characters are built incredibly, everything is just so nice :D, I learnt a lot about how the NASA works, the astronauts and of course mars.
B000I9YLWG|5.0|Hitchcock's masterpiece was the first of its kind with a truly disturbing psychopath and suspenseful lead to finding the killer!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|keep it clean and charge !!!I will buy another one for my son since he always carries his in his school bag
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|As a YA sc-fi story I'm sure it was interesting, and in truth there's much more opportunity to develop the fantasy world of the story. For the movie ... I simply could not buy the premise, which made everything else seem just silly.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Fellowship of the ring. Rinse n repeat. Seemed like all the same stuff. Very little was different. Gotta be a fanboy to like it.
B0070DR5Y4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as a movie, but once again it is not the true story of Robin Hood. One day I hope Holly Wood will get it straight. The story of Robin hood is true. A monument in England stands with the story of Robin Hood. Thank you.<br /><br />John
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have not finished the series but Amazon tempted me to buy it and so far... it is very good.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|Great watch for the money. Large dial with easy to read numbers. Very light compared to other watches I would definitely recommend
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Excellent Collection, you cannot go wrong with Sherlock Holmes, an all time favorite book, I enjoyed my holidays reading it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was ok, it was a quick read.<br />I guess from the way people talked I was just expecting more.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My son loves it.  Build what ever you want and tear down again.  Plus you have to fight off creepers
B004OC07N0|2.0|Very dry and a boring read. There are better alternatives out there. The book has a very dated feel and honestly feels like it is from the 70's
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works great. Easy to use. Has a range of ring tones. I recommend for any Kindle Fire. Is now my regular alarm clock.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I didn't want to put it down. The characters seemed so real. The book is full of hope even through the chapters in the orphanage. Can't wait to read another book by Christina McKenna.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy the graphics of this game and the amazing touch and control. This game is a pleasure to play !
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is well written and easy to read.  If you enjoy this type of book, I recommend reading this one.
B0087EACJK|2.0|To get 3 stars or whatever it is on each level you have to play through the level a few times to figure out what order to move the segments around in, then start playing it again trying to remember it all at high speeds, making the game feel like a chore
B0061P2L5U|5.0|Whether you suffer from allergic or autoimmune disease or take car of someone who does, this up-to-date, thorough and well-written book gives you all the latest data in an academic, commercially unbiased way. It helps explain what we know about why westernized countries suffer from so much allergic and autoimmune disease. It also provides hope for the millions of sufferers of allergy and autoimmunity. Best of all, the author reviews the latest treatment protocols and provides warnings to those who are desperate for some treatment of their illness to protect them from opportunists. The references are impeccable and provide further reading suggestions should you be so inclined. As a physician, I feel that the findings presented here should change the way we practice.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Valentina makes the piano sing like no other pianist I have heard recently. Watching her play on youtube reminded me of Tai Chi - flowing yet powerful, like her hands and the sound she produces. She dances on the keys, such a pleasure to watch her play and yet, I must work. So I purchased her CD, closed my eyes and let my tears flow. If I were only allowed one CD on my desert island this would be it.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|truly timberlake !! if u love his music..u will love this for sure... its a new style but definitely grows on you
0385344228|3.0|Our book club loved Gone Girl, and was looking for another thriller, so picked Defending Jacob.  As a group, we generally liked, but didn't love.
B00123JR0I|5.0|Depeche Mode has always been one of my favorite bands and Black Celebration is truly their best album.  Very few bands have stayed together like Depeche Mode.
0062060562|3.0|Our book club loved Gone Girl, and was looking for another thriller, so picked Before I Go to Sleep.  As a group, we generally liked it, but the biggest complaint was that the middle part before the action went on for way too long.  A few didn't finish because of the middle, while others like better than Gone Girl.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Didn't want to put it down. Glad that a friend recommended it to me. I'll be telling others to read it.
0345525558|5.0|I loved the combination of my passion for flowers and how they can apply to life, which this book does in both happy and sad ways.  The dictionary in the back means I'll keep it and tell friends they have to buy their own copy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|When i played this the first time around i enjoyed it.  Untill my games started to roll back.  I would make certain strides and achievements, then come back to the game i started up at a previous point and lost what i had accomplished.<br /><br />2nd time around much better.  Looks like they fixed that bug plus the additions that they made was worth giving this another go.
0061120073|4.0|As a book club, we decided that as New Yorkers we should read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  Parts are very sad, and others made us feel grateful for those who came before us.  Many of the group didn't finish because it is pretty long.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It keeps you constantly changing your mind about Jacob's guilt or innocence.  You have to keep reading.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I was a bit disapppointed with the ending.  I guess the author wants us to draw our own conclusions.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|Very rarely do i find an album where i like every song but this is one of thoes albums. Its not as hard as some of the past albums but its just as good if not better, it is a must buy even if your not a hardcore Volbeat fan.
B003L7DK74|5.0|My wife and I watched an episode of the show at a friend's house a few years ago, and then we saw a couple more episodes on a plane flight a few weeks later.  We were hooked.<br /><br />I finally got around to buying the complete collection for my birthday this year.  (yeah, I bought myself a gift).  We have enjoyed the show yet again.  I love all the totally absurd, yet deadpan humor.
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Blake has a firm grasp onto the music that people want to hear. Ballard's, funny, Romantic. He has it going on right now.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|What can I say?  It is a fantastic record.  He is an icon,  He has written several of the songs on this record.  His guests are all icon's as well.  Almost 60 years of making music.  Hit after hit...............................
B009K6DKTS|5.0|O livro merece a classificação por sua abordagem original da antifragilidade e de como a presença de estressores na nossa vida gera maior resiliência e evolução pessoal.<br />Em diversas partes do livro o autor enfatiza a necessidade de correr riscos como forma de levar uma vida autêntica e evitar &#34;viver os projetos de outros&#34; ao inventar nossos pr&oacute;prios caminhos.<br />Este livro &eacute; essencial para pessoas independentes, adolescentes &agrave; busca de caminhos e a todos os indiv&iacute;duos que vão atr&aacute;s de seus sonhos.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|The recordings are clear, crisp, and so well done you can imagine being in the audience. I've seen this show on Broadway, and the recording is a great reminder of how wonderful this show was in person. I also love that Amazon included the music in digital format along with the physical CD.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Because the movie doesn't really have an ending I gave it 4 stars. But overall I loved it. I was drawn in right from the first. I love seeing the Hobbit world come to life. I love seeing Tolkien's stories being told.<br /><br />I think the actors really grasped their characters. All of them became the characters I imagined in my head while reading. I can't wait to see where the next two movies go.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|It's so nice to hear a good quality/content...c.d.  You'll like this by the fourth track...\\"Rainy night in Georgia\\"....if you can pull off a remake...and do it well...you know this artist  c.d. will be a winner.  Boz sounds as good as he did in the 70's...well worth the investment...RDC
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great read.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book and love DeMille`s sense of humor. It is always hard for to put down his books.
B0018RDP7O|5.0|I've loved this album since I was a little kid. Fantastic bass, and great lyrics make this one of my all time favs.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A great story - well told and well acted. I enjoyed the way it unfolded.  Be aware that, even if you watch it in public, you might still cry.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|It's better than your average movie and is also a better than average movie adaptation of a good book. Well done, albeit a bit hokey with some of Woody Harrelson's lines when you first see his character, and Peeta's face paint when he's hiding is ridiculous. Otherwise, it was a pretty good flick.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Thank you for the prompt delivery, I have totally enjoyed the book and a wonderful book of great principals to adopt for a reality way of life.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids love the game. They're playing it every day. :)<br />Even I have been playing it! Can't wait to see how the game progresses further.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pleasenget this game I like it a lot it is fun and easy for.my 8 year old daughter to play so please rate app and buy app
B000OVLINI|2.0|Book is &#34;over-written&#34; and contrived. Some errors of time and culture. Nothing genuine about it. Forced myself to continue reading. I regret the purchase.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Simply delightful! You'll be engrossed from the start. Characters are fantastic, storyline is fantastic, visually stunning. Watch it. You won't be sorry.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Typical of Roald Dahl, this story is a bit crazy, but the movie was good, true to the book as far as I could tell.  It's been about ten years since I read the book.  Quite funny, a bit blizzard, but good entertainment.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of satire, lots of Willis type humor and cool action and all the actors put it together. Life can be great even at over 60!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the way this book played out. I love the chemistry between the characters. Most importantly you learn so much about them and you
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Although I usually enjoy the clinical and scientific detail in Reich's novels, I felt a bit bogged down in some of the diamond mining minutiae that I thought was unnecessarily descriptive.
B000FA675C|5.0|The book was exciting and mysterious and started me on a path to read others of Dan Brown's book including Deception Point and others.  I found his books truly hard to put down and look forward to his new book coming out soon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and addictive<br />must have mini games are a great challenge. so get it. now<br />have fun and enjoy the ride
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|CD. what more to say? I &#60;3 Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros. Item just as described & in original packaging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|\\"Subway Surfers,\\" is an awesome game. It is a lot like the popular game, \\"Temple Run,\\" but i like this game even better. You can go on top of subway cars, or you can stay on the tracks. You must look out for moving cars, and jumps and ducks. I gave this game five stars and it definitely deserved it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was painful to read this book. The main character functioned way below her actual maturity level and her language was just flat out annoying.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was too short but I liked it other than that......... nine more words required so I'm typing random things.
B008393Q2O|3.0|I downloaded this to check it out and see if i preferred this to apps I was using. The different color stickie  notes reminded me a lot of the app COLOR NOTES. I prefer the layer because it has widgets that look like actual post it notes on your screen. You can color code them and you have them at a touch for easy access and reminders. I've got then for to-dos, grocery list (they have a special layout making it easy to move and cross out items 0 random memos etc. Oh well this shouldnt turn into a review of that. Main point is in my short time exploring this, I didn't find a reason to switch to it so it went back to the big Amazon cloud in the sky
0385349947|5.0|Insightful, important book.  Engagingly written and truly captures the subtle and overt pressures that face women who want a family as well as professional achievement.  As a working woman with young children, I deeply related to Sandberg's message, and both my husband and I took a lot from this book.<br /><br />One note on the audiobook - the woman who reads it has an immature intonation that I found distracting from Sandberg's message.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is more then I expected it to be. I had no idea how bad things were over there. It surely opens your eyes
B009LMTDL0|4.0|While I don't think there is any ground-breaking new information in Sheryl Sandberg's book, I do think she brings a new perspective on feminism and I love the concept of &#34;leaning in&#34; ... whether it be to lean into your career or to lean into your life. More than anything, I appreciate the national dialogue that this book has generated.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Pertect fit,great construction, Every thing I expected.  Would recomended it other kindle users. I'm also thinking of getting another one.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I didn't want to like it.  But I did... I liked it a lot... damnit... and NOW I have to watch season 2 and THEN I'll have to be crabby and annoyed until I can get season 3 on-line.  DAMNIT.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|H was hoping for the beginning of the story.  I have all the Lord of the Rings books and dvds also,  I may be in the older generation but love these
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I never planned on buying e-books, I was more than happy just using a print book. That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|I recommend to all of the Underworld fans! it is a little different in cinematography due to new direction and there was pink lipstick that caused an eruption of consideration as to why pink? Why not red or the natural color of her lips which are far too appealing to list here. Enjoy the movie that has no way let me down as a fan of the movie, Selene, or or the filmmakers themselves. it packs a lot of punch and action. Great viewing, and enthralling storyline.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|It stands, it revolves, it holds the Kindle securely in place, but doesn't impede the ports or speakers.  It has a hand strap!  The only thing missing is a place to store a stylus, but that's so minor I won't take anything away, since the elastic band that holds it closed works for that, too.  Reasonably priced, too!  Solid construction.<br /><br />It is being used primarily by kids, and there isn't a scratch on either the case or the Kindle.  If the manufacturer makes them, I would buy this case for other devices too, without hesitation.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|This was my first experience with this band, but I am very impressed.  They successfully fuse elements of modern rock with blues, soul, rockabilly, and rock and roll to create a very unique and compelling sound on this album.  Perhaps the best thing I can say is that the album gets better with each listen.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the above genres and to anyone complaining about the perceived lack of talented, original musicians in pop music today.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  An amazing man that emerged to lead our nation as no other could.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Though it's not my favorite Muse album (yet), it does get better with each listen, so only time will tell.  With this album, Muse continues to develop their lush, complex arrangements.  At times, this feels almost like a rock-infused classical music album than a high-concept prog rock album, which is totally fine with me, but may not be for everyone.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I don't think AccuWeather's are the most accurate, but the app is nice... especially the latest update. The movement through the screens and functions are smooth. Running in the background is fine ... you get alerts that way.
B0081336FO|5.0|The show is smart, fast paced and intelligent.  All the actors are very good, but Benedict Cumberbatch makes Sherlock come alive.  I would recommend this show to any lover of mystery and suspense. Awaiting season 3.<br />Well done all!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Make you think of you life and how fast things can change. Happy and loving. Feel good movie, loved it !!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have been a big fan of DeMille for many years and loved the &#34;Lion&#34; series.  The Panther follows in the same John Corey style.  I like the obvious research that DeMille puts into each book about the security agencies, the terrorist psyche, the details about the countries all make for a great read.  I hope this isn't the last one in the John Corey series.  DeMille is one of the few authors that I read again and again and am never disappointed!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is perfect! It is light weight and strong. You can charge your kindle fire while it is in tis case and it stands up perfectly even when you are reading in bed.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Doctor Who just gets better and better.  Donna is great as a companion.  I'm part way through this season and find I'm very attached to the characters.
B008602KQI|1.0|Headache while watching the movie? Yes. After some scenes, I soon decided to skip the scenes where the camera seems to be held by someone with parkinson's disease. That was about 40% of the movie. The earlier scenes were bearable but then I noticed that the camera movements slowly started to cause discomfort.<br /><br />I was told this was being done by some experimental director? I don't know if it's true, but if it is then this guy needs to learn to do experimental films on non-big production movies.<br /><br />Main complaint is the style of the movie...don't remember much on the content.
B004HAEGP4|5.0|I love this series of movies. The only movie based on a game that is worth watching. They just keep getting better!!!!
B00013RC66|4.0|It is still a very good movie and Debra Winger is great in it.  It is an older movie and I think I enjoyed it more the first time I saw it.  Movies have come a long way since this one was made.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The movie had excellent animation and had some funny elements, but it is more for kids of today... they had every music scene autotuned into some boy band/tpain type song. But other than the music it was funny.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Just really like this book, had to read it until the end in 1.5 days, it could have been a little bit better on describing how the couple met, wanted more detail ;)
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|The ONLY movie I've ever scene where the sequels keep getting better. Besides its got Milla kicking ass in her sexy wear what more could you ask for
B0064QNS62|3.0|It's okay but run of the mill. Not a lot of cerebral challenge here. It's fun in a mindless way.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I have the feeling that most of the people that say they like this movie are doing so because they are supposed to like it. It has ernest, good, liberal intentions.  If you say you don't like it, perhaps you are racist or perhaps you don't understand the movie.<br /><br />WhatEver.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis's performance is studied, mannered, ponderous and very irritating. It has the single virtue of being less irritating than his repulsive performance in \\"There Will be Blood\\" - a performance that also won an Oscar, proving that the Academy Awards are more about what is supposed to be good rather than what is actually so.<br /><br />Ramond Massey did a better job in a much more entertaining movie.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I watched the movie 1st then I read the book and I thought that I would like the movie better....... I was so wrong!!!!!<br />The thing that I disliked about this book is really nothing except for the<br />Fact that I NEVER wanted to put the book down when I started reading! I recommend this book to anyone whe likes exciding book that grab your attention! Have fun reading it!!!!! :)

B0067TGSOK|3.0|I like to call Chris Gullibeau the ringleader for a new breed of entrepreneurs.  They’re not looking to create the next big thing, sell their company for a billion dollars, or hustle their way to an IPO. They’re teaching others - through their blogs, courses and ebooks - how to make a living doing something that they are passionate about which, most of the time, involves leaving idea of ‘traditional employment’ to pursue something more meaningful.<br /><br />This book features a number of people who have done exactly that - left their corporate jobs (voluntarily or not) and created their own businesses with very little financial investment.  It’s coupled with practical advice on how to find a healthy balance between your passion and what people what to buy.<br /><br />The information in this book is very basic, best suited for someone just toying with the idea of striking out on his/her own, and who perhaps hasn't read many business books. While it’s inspiring and entertaining to read about these success stories, the book fails to dig deeper into the specific challenges, events or wins that enabled these entrepreneurs to succeed. For example, on a whim, two friends decided to create a website to sell prints of maps they had created because they had extra copies available. The next morning, they had their first sale, and the rest is history. I would like to have learned more about how they marketed themselves to get that first sale or what connections they had.<br /><br />I’m a fan of Chris Guillebeau and very much enjoyed his first book, the Art of NonConformity. This book is well written, inspiring and easy to digest, but I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps it’s because I’m an entrepreneur myself and have read dozens and dozens of books and blogs (and experienced much of it!) over the years and just found the $100 Startup too simplistic. Nevertheless, I was entertained and have tremendous respect for Chris and the work that he does.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a great game and would recommend it to anyone who likes to play Mario.  Plus it's  free too so if you don't like spending money on games or apps; this game is for you...so you should buy it.<br /><br />Well go on...click the button.
B000FC2OHA|4.0|I’ve read Chicken Soup for the Soul, seen him in The Secret, listened to one of his free audio talks, and have generally associated Canfield as a self help A-lister. I’ve always liked his approachable, easy to understand style this book is no different. It outlines 64 principles for living a life of passion, purpose and success covering everything from goal setting to friendships to facing your fears to managing your money.  For those of you who have read countless self help books, you’ll likely have heard many of them before. I certainly skimmed through a number of chapters, while others I found more valuable.<br /><br />The length of the book is certainly overwhelming, but it is divided into chapters that are brief and concise. Canfield injects lots of exercises and processes into the book making it difficult to keep up (I did some, ignored others), but they are worthwhile. The Success Principles covers everything, so if you’re looking to focus on a very specific topic, this isn’t the right read for you. But it is a great book to have in your library, one to turn to for inspiration and one worth coming back to, especially when there’s a topic you want insight on or challenge that you’re looking to work through.

B00BVVA138|2.0|I'm an original KSE fan as I'm sure most of you are. But as my title state's, musically this band has fizzled. I'm not sure if it is because there is so much saturation of this same kind of metal, or the fact I have grown up musically and appreciate more cutting edge style metal. I appreciate bands that try to expand their sound and push themselves. There is just nothing new to hear in this album... same old riff's, same old gallop drum beat and fills. Even Jesse's lyrics sound like a dumbed-down version of what he is doing in [[ASIN:B00BG1LKRO The Empire Shall Fall]] (which is a band I love). Also a big fan of his other band, [[ASIN:B004FXG67E Times of Grace]].<br /><br />KSE just needs to push themselves to try something different... this failed miserably in that department. I'm sure for someone new to metal this may be a good listen, as the lyrics are fairly easy to digest. I just sadly found I had to force myself to keep listening to the album, even though I was shaking my head in disappointment.<br /><br />For perspective, I'm listening to bands like [[ASIN:B007XHWNTY Gojira]], [[ASIN:B0041B785Y Meshuggah]], [[ASIN:B004KRQELS Born of Osiris]], [[ASIN:B0029VX276 Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[ASIN:B002OLN33O Between the Buried and Me]], [[ASIN:B001Q8FSTI Cynic]], [[ASIN:B000WC38OG Sybreed]], bla bla bla.<br /><br />Anyway, just my 2 cents.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Compared to other steven spielberg movies this is not one of his best, but compared to a lot of movies that have come out it is very good. The film seemed a little drawn out at times, the length wasn't a problem, some of the scenes in the movie were kind of preachy and boring. On the other hand, daniel day lewis's performance was incredible! It's like i was watching the actual Abraham Lincoln. It is truly one of his best roles. In a nut shell, you will not see an amazing movie but this is a must see performance by Lewis.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutley LOVE this game!  I have been playing this game for awhile now and I couldnt ask for more from a truly free game.  There is always something different to do and its not hard to advance and its always fun to play.  I have tried to play other games that claim to be &quot;free&quot;  but they always want you to buy the full version after like the first few levels, but not this game it said it was free and it really is.  I look foward to reaching higher levels and unlocking different rooms...im always surprised!

B008JAGZDE|5.0|Great movie for any fans of the series made in the 90s. If you haven't seen the previous movies I wouldn't recommend.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show took me off guard. Usually I am not a fan of fantasy films like this, or LOTR, another exception. There was something about the story and the characters that seemed to draw me in. The drama these families are going through makes for entertaining television, for certain, but there is more going on than just bloodshed. My mom and my dad are both interested in this series and are still watching season one.<br /><br />I haven't finished season two, but it is definitely off to a good start.
1582406723|5.0|The Walking Dead Vol 1 is great. I received my book in perfect condition. Great read for fans of the tv show.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was phenomenal as usual. They said Sally Field was to get an award for her role her (maybe she did, I don't know), but both Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were the stars of this show. They acted like the true giants of film that they have proven themselves to be. This is not a war movie, so if you're looking for explosions, try elsewhere.<br /><br />The part about this movie that strikes me, is that it is questionable as to how Lincoln's last few months were played out as he finished the war, and abolished slavery. Did he really postpone the ending of the war to make it happen? Surely this is a magnanimous man, but to believe that some of the things that took place in the movie is fact is a hard apron to swallow. Being one who doesn't know much about history, especially the nit-picky type material portrayed in this movie, I wonder about the accuracy of the story while simultaneously worrying that the younger generation will think this is truth, and not just Hollywood story telling.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|I'm giving this movie a 2 because it didn't completely suck. It just felt like it dragged and I lost interest.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Good songwriting returning from Alice in Chains, and the band is back sounding similar to before. AIC fans are likely to enjoy this music.
B00BBRR21Q|4.0|Yep, I'm old enough to get &#34;deluxe anniversay&#34; reissues of one off albums of my youth.....sigh...The whole &#34;Seattle/Grunge/Alternative thing happened my senior year of High School/Freshman year of college, in other words, it could not have happened at a better time. The music of roughly 1991-1995 seemed to belong to me in a way that othe rmusic I was listening to did not.<br />Mad Season was a &#34;supergroup&#34; of sorts. Layne Staley, who seemed to be MIA at times, popped up sounding clear headed, giving fans hopes for new Alice In Chains music. Pearl Jam's Mike McCready brought along John Baker Saunders from a stint in rehab, and Barrett Martin, drummer from the underappreciated Screaming Trees dropped Mad Season to a &#34;meh, its ok&#34; critical response, but fans, myself included, had the CD in heavy rotation for months. The inclusion of the Trees singer Mark Lanegan, one of the best voices from the Northwest, only sweetened the deal.<br />The album hasn't aged as well as some others of the era, but &#34;River of Deciet&#34;, &#34;Above&#34; and &#34;Wake Up&#34; still sound fresh. The bonus materials are the main attraction and they are plentiful. The Live at The Moore disc shows a band owning the stage, strong powerful. Its a little bittersweet, wondering what might have been had Layne lived, but its also a celebration of what once was. The three new tracks featuring Lanegan on vocals are some of his best vocal work. &#34;Black Book of Fear&#34; and &#34;Slip Away&#34; in particular have been on repeat for me.<br />So enjoy your old age, slip on some headphones, listen to &#34;Long Gone Day&#34; and remember all that those we lost gave us for a short while.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|It is tragic that, like so many elderly people, Baroness Thatcher suffered dementia at the end of her life. Loving my elders as I do, I have to say that for this movie to focus as it does on the sad end of such a remarkable life is deeply inappropriate. Of course, Meryl Streep does a brilliant job. She in fact won the Oscar with the votes of Academy members who must hate Margaret Thactcher as much as she does. I'd rather see Streep portray a madwoman honestly. Thatcher's was a life of firsts, a remarkable woman's success story. Given that, this film is beyond misogynist. It does not matter what anyone thinks of Thatcher's career. This treatment of her life is deeply disrespectful. I wonder if the dotage of a male leader would ever serve as the center of a biographical narrative of his life. Will a biorgraphical movie of Bill Clinton's presidency be narrated by an actress portraying Monica Lewinsky? I somehow doubt it.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|There is no shortage of debate over wheater  or not this is indeed &#34;The Greatest Movie of All Time&#34; or not, and I won't rehash it here. I will say that Warner Bros. has done a loving HD transfer of Orson Welles debut, blacks are deep and the film is bright and crisp, with much more detail visable than in the previous DVD release.  The first shot through the Kane compound's fence, stark, showing the grain of its age, but clearly detailed, tells you right away what you are in for.<br /><br />The supplements are carried over from the DVD with nothing new, but having the Roger Ebert commentary is worth the price alone. It rivals the best commentaries of Scorsese with its insight, detail, and obvious love of the film. The documentary included &#34;The Battle Over Citizen Kane&#34; offers nothing new, but for those unfamiliar with the film's backstory and Welle's struggles, it will no doubt provide some interest. As for the packaging, you are either a fan of the &#34;Digibook&#34; style or you aren't. I for one am, and the pictures, quotes and the like included in the book make a nice companion piece to the film.<br /><br />Kane is an undeniable masterpiece, and teh Blu Ray is a worthy upgrade from previous editions. Highly recommended.

B00B97SNJI|4.0|The West Coast revival continues with this third album from post Laurel Canyon troubadours Dawes. After a recent spell supporting Mumford and Sons in the UK they have shifted across the US coasts from West to East and recorded this album in five weeks last September in Asheville, North Carolina. Stories Don't End seeks to polish and redefine their sound, which has leaned heavily thus far on Jackson Browne, Neil Young and the Eagles. In doing so the words and songs of band leader Taylor Goldsmith are bang smack in the middle of this record and it does mark a less laid back approach than their previous albums.<br /><br />It is however a non-Goldsmith song that immediately draws you in the form of Dawes country rock cover of \\"Hey lover\\" by former band member the wonderful Blake Mills. This is a joyous if twisted track that could have happily graced any Elliot Smith album and the band nail it. The big changes come on tracks like \\"Bear Witness\\" where at last you can really feel a sense of big production that has been lacking from previous records and a Goldsmith vocal that stretches every sinew of his vocal chords. Not all is change as the pounding opener \\"Just beneath the surface\\" is a great piece of West Coast Jackson Browne inspired rock which is bookended with a much slower acoustic version of the same song to close the album. Songs like the pounding melodic rock of \\"From a Window seat\\" do owe a debt to \\"Tusk\\" era Fleetwood Mac which is no bad thing, while \\"Most People\\" takes the same harmonic rock and crafts it into an album standout. The jaunty \\"Someone will\\" brings a nice slice of California sunshine into your living room although Goldsmith's lyrics here are rather weak. Similarly \\"Side effects\\" struggles to get going and you are never certain when it arrives. The single \\"Just my luck\\" wipes out this deficit and is a forlorn and simple plaintive ballad where the band may have a crafted a minor gem. Finally the finely crafted pop rock of \\"From the right angle\\" show that while Dawes positively eschew surfing along the cutting edge of music they produce a classic sound and do it very well.<br /><br />\\"Stories Don't End\\" by Dawes is by a country mile the most accomplished of their albums thus far with is quality threshold largely maintained throughout. It is further proof that there is considerable mileage left in uncovering that authentic tradition and vibe from 1970s Laurel Canyon and tapping directly into the laid-back Californian aesthetic of songs with dangerous hints of melodthat while Dawes positively eschew surfing along the cutting edge of music they produce a classic sound and do it very well.<br /><br />\\"Stories Don't End\\" by Dawes is by a country mile the most accomplished of their albums thus far with is quality threshold largely maintained throughout.

B0031RS2HC|3.0|Disappointing,maybe I'm just a bit fed up of these books and I haven't read them in the right order which doesn't help.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|I would recommend this album to anyone, but particularly to those who are new to progressive rock - this is an album at the genesis (pardon the pun) of the prog rock genre, and one that needs to be in the collection of all serious musicians and audiophiles. The production and engineering of this album are (still) years ahead of their time, and the songs are all classic in their own right. It's difficult to have an intelligent discussion of prog rock without the inclusion of Genesis and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.

From electric pop, punk, ballads, and uke interludes, this album is hard not to listen to on repeat!<br /><br />Favorites:<br />Aint It Fun - There is soul in this song.<br />Stil into You- The electricity in this song is resounding.<br />(One of those) Crazy Girls- Paramore's answer to Taylor Swift! There is humor in this 60's sounding ballad.<br />Anklebiters- Fun, pop punk beat.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I was a huge fan during the era of Tom Baker, and was more than a bit skeptical when it first reappeared in 2005.  Christopher Eccleston did a Fantastic job of resurrecting the role, and it was a huge loss when he pulled out after the first season.  I would have liked to see him do two more years, and then followed by Tennant for another four.  Regardless, the first &#34;new&#34; season was great.  Billie Piper is an amazing companion, and easily above the level of Sarah Jane.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie certainly doesn't sound like he's 66 and he can still rock like he's 36! His voice shows no signs of age from wear and tear. Each song has its own value and he uses all ranges and nuances of his beautiful voice. Get the deluxe version because the three bonus songs are superb. If this is the last album he ever writes and sings, he's going out on a high note. This is quickly becoming my fave Bowie album, and I have them all. Brilliant lyrics too. Don't even hesitate if you like/love Bowie; you need this!

This about the size of a silver dollar. Two buttons and a light. Press and hold the button a blue light comes on. Press + it gets louder, - lower. Plug the usb connection into a computer and it charges. The charge lasts pretty long --for me a couple of movies.As I say in the title mine is connected to 20' cord plugged into a RCA mini adapter, I then plug headphones into the FiiO. The sound is clear with reasonable depth. It does not have a deep bass though so if thats your thing...keep on looking.

0446580848|4.0|I've traveled a long road with Nelson DeMille's character John Corey since he was introduced in \\"Plum Island.\\"  That road has reached some extraordinary highlights with \\"The Lion's Game\\" and \\"Plum Island\\" and twisted at the lows with \\"Wild Fire\\" and \\"The Lion.\\"  For me, \\"The Panther\\" fell someplace in-between and was generally a consistently entertaining piece of fiction.  Perhaps Mr. DeMille has allowed John Corey's character to get a bit too far over the top in actions and humor but he still keeps me turning the pages at laser speed.  I would enjoy perhaps a break for the Corey saga for a novel or two if Mr. DeMille was inclined to offer us another stand alone novel with a new group of personalities.  His many previous successful novels have shown that there are other tales of intrigue he is quite capable of offering.  I would recommend \\"The Panther\\" to anyone looking for a summer diversion but most probably suggest that they start at the beginning of the Corey stories or try another DeMille novel, if they have never read him in the past.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was sick when the child showed me this game.  Later I became curious when I could think better.  I down loaded it and have played it for hours since then.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Everything is perfect I can go on fb and log in and everything is goin just right and there's no problems
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So, I went into this book with severe reservations due to the very opinionated reviews here on Amazon. I trust my fellow Amazonians and had decided not to read this book. Well a friend of mine read it and said it was the best book she's read in a long time. Although I wouldn't go so far as to say it was amazing...it did have its good qualities. I agree with the other reviews- in so far as it seems a bit juvenile and repetitive. This is one of those books that has \\"something\\", but is seriously lacking \\"something.\\" Ultimately, the author did an ok job, but it could've been so much better.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|i absolutely  love this game i cant put it down even though you have to  buy the full version it is so worth it

1476734941|5.0|This is a straight forward presentation on a novel way to implement a food management system with significant results. More importantly, he provides a sound scientific context for the 5:2 approach. Lastly, it is extremly easy to implement and you will see  immediate results!! Less a diet than a lifestyle shift. Super book!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy.  I gave it five stars because of the emotions it brought.  I was &#34;simple&#34; reading, but it had everything I like in a novel.  It had of course LOVE, it had a little suspense, it had family values and so many sensitive moments....it even made me shed a tear or two.....yes, I would recommend it to those who want to examine their own sexuality !!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this album and perhaps listen to it too much, too loud.  Few albums these days have such a great collection of songs, but rather 2-3 great songs, and a few ok or not so ok.  I bought the CD with the free Cloud download... that I like!  Some Nights (Intro) sets the stage for a fun ride.

B008220DGE|4.0|The Master is an uncomfortable piece of cinema. Characters are irritating, pacing is slow, and the plot is pieced together through flashbacks and the occasional hallucination. The movie will frustrate some and absorb others, but the gorgeous cinematography, evocative music, and fantastic acting make it a film worth seeing. Though much of the movie may be baffling, it raises valid questions about the human condition.<br /><br />The story follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), an alcoholic and addled veteran of World War II. He stumbles across philosopher Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his group of followers. Lancaster, everything Freddie is not, takes him under his wing and teaches him about \\"The Cause,\\" a way of living which includes acknowledging past lives.<br /><br />Phoenix is astounding as Freddie, an embodiment of the id. His poisonous moonshine exacerbates his mental disorders. Unusual for the movies, he is completely unglamorous. Freddie's hunched over, thin form and gnarled but enthralling face contrast with Lancaster's paunchy figure and composed expression. Hoffman is, of course, excellent. Amy Adams (or her character) is slightly over-the-top as Lancaster's uncompassionate and creepy wife Peggy.<br /><br />Freddie's existence disproves Lancaster's mantra, \\"Man is not an animal,\\" which may be why Lancaster is so drawn to him. Freddie is by and large loyal to Lancaster, dangerously so. Their relationship is a strange love story of sorts. In the end, though, Freddie is his own man, a chaotic force of nature. Will the brainwashing techniques of The Cause work on him?<br /><br />Deep, dark colors emphasize a sense of post-war paranoia, and the unique cinematography and music emphasize how strange people are. Everyone is searching for some kind of truth, be it through control or a connection. The Master may be full of symbolism, but its oddness makes one thing very clear: humans are silly and fascinating creatures.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the one of the best books I have ever read.<br />I think my favorite part was when peata takes care of Katnise.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have have been building computers for just about 10 years. I have almost always used Artic Silver 5. It is definetly better than the oem thermal compound that usually comes on new heatsinks with your processor. It always comes in handy when working on other peoples computers.  I don't really have any complaints so that is why I continue to buy it.
B0041B785Y|4.0|I'm on a major trip as a relatively new Meshuggah freak and have been deeply absorbing this trailblazing metal outfit's entire catalog (including the live album and the EP's) over the past several months. As of now, the two albums that really stand out for me are 'ObZen' and 'Chaosphere'. The next two for me are 'Destroy Erase Improve' and this latest offering 'Koloss'. As I had mentioned in my review of 'ObZen', I felt that album released in 2008 was a great culmination of what Meshuggah had done artistically and sonically until then in one very cohesive yet wide-ranging package. My thoughts were that it would be hard to equal - let alone surpass - the impact of that amazing album which I now rate over such metal classics as 'Master of Puppets' and 'Reign in Blood'.<br /><br />I have listened to 'Koloss' from start to finish at least a few dozen times now so I feel I'm ready to post my initial thoughts. The thing about Meshuggah's albums is that as time goes by, your thoughts and initial judgements can and will inevitably change. Meshuggah's music has a way of sneaking up on you suddenly and exhibit things that one didn't notice before as well as simply growing on you with repeated listenings. As others have mentioned in their various reviews of Meshuggah's albums, some tracks that you initially dislike or even hate can eventually become some of your favorites. One needs to be somewhat patient and also willing to *think* about what's going on underneath the sonic mayhem to truly appreciate what this band is doing.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that 'Koloss' is a very solid effort from these masters of extreme metal who really have no equal in the genre they literally invented. I'm sure most long-time Meshuggah fans love the album and I understand that some might even feel that it's the band's best ever. After 'ObZen', it's natural for the band to seek a new artistic and sonic direction. I realize that Meshuggah is not about repeating themselves with each new release.For me, the thing that stood out immediately was the production that give it a completely different feel from 'ObZen'. The overall sound is noticeably more compressed and polished sounding with a lot more bass. To me, 'ObZen' has a more \\"open\\" and wider sound spectrum that still retains the clarity and punch of the individual instruments and Kidman's voice. Things just sound more bunched up together and a bit squashed in comparison on 'Koloss'. But, again, some people may prefer this kind of sound over 'ObZen's and it's all subjective in the end.<br /><br />There are some strong memorable tunes on this album but some just don't seem to grow on me like the tunes in 'Chaosphere', 'ObZen', 'DEI', and 'Nothing' have with repeated listenings. There seems to be more emphasis on heavier grooves on this album than in the aforementioned albums although tracks like 'The Demon's Name is Surveillance', 'The Hurt That Finds You First', and 'Swarm' show that Meshuggah can be as fast they need to be in the classic thrash fashion. Personally, I enjoy a good deal of speed and fast tempo but prefer a good balance between the slower groover-oriented tunes with heavy bone-crushing riffs and thrash-driven speed. For me, this album seems to lean on more of the slower grooves and atmospherics than other albums of the past - which is fine.<br /><br />The slower tunes that I really like are 'Behind the Sun' and 'Marrow'. The riffs are memorable and have a visceral quality that punches you in the gut that we've come to expect from Meshuggah. 'Break Those Bones...' and 'Demiurge' also have their good moments but 'I Am Colossus' has a plodding feel to it that I don't particularly care for. In fact, I feel that the entire album sounds and feels a bit lethargic compared to the kinetic energy, the savage brutality and the sheer aggressiveness of 'ObZen' and 'Chaosphere'. Don't get me wrong - 'Koloss' is a must-have for any Meshuggah fan but I don't think it captures the vital energy of the band as well as the aforementioned albums. Also, I just don't feel the material is as strong although I wouldn't go far as to say the tunes are \\"B-sides\\" compared to the tunes on 'ObZen'.<br /><br />That being said, I'm still in the midst of listening to this album on a regular basis and my thoughts will evolve as I continue to get more familiar with the tunes and the things going on underneath. One thing that stood out for me on this album is how good Fredrick Thordendal's lead playing continues to develop and improve with each new release. FT is a monster player and musician with a very distinctive style. I'm a huge fan of various virtuoso guitar players - Guthrie Govan, Michael Landau, Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny, Tosin Abasi, Allan Holdsworth, etc. - and FT is right up there with the best and is probably the most distinctive stylist in all of metal lead playing. His lines are often very jagged but at the same time sinewy, snaky, and flowing with a very horn-like character. His short solo on 'Do Not Look Down' was reminiscent of what I expect to hear from Govan - aggressive and wild yet controlled and extremely precise. Fredrick has certainly become one of my favorite guitar players.<br /><br />To recap, I heartily recommend this album to any existing Meshuggah or extreme prog-metal fan but I feel it's not quite up to par with 'ObZen', which I now consider the new benchmark of metal at its most extreme and finest.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I love the series and I love this book. I love the Wizards rules that Richard learns along the series. They can be related to every day life. There are some weird sex scenes with the wizard of the dark which wouldn't be good for kids and people who are against those sort of things. Overall though the book and series are great.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|If this was a view of life in that time, I cannot believe that anyone would have survived, let alone prospered at all.  The evil personality traits that seemed to permeate almost every charactor left no room for hope.  This book was as dark and depressing as anything I have ever read.
006117758X|3.0|This is the story of Henry Chinaski growing up. He lives in a city surrounded by bigger boys that love to fight him. The school system never defends him against these boys. His father is a hard man, even more terrifying than the boys. His mother is a meek and submissive woman. The story is mostly about these circumstances and how Henry comes of age to be an extraordinarily bitter, somewhat crazy young man.<br /><br />This is not really fun reading to me. There's beatings everywhere. Daily after-school fights, stalkings, harrassments. Fathers and principals that are unhinged maniacs when you're accused of the slightest (almost always false) offense. Then there's adolescent sexuality on many pages done with the delicacy of a porno flick, often with children using the same words to describe it that porn uses today. This is a writer that sees vulgarity as the medium for his thoughts, no doubt.<br /><br />Though at times it feels like Bukowski is just upping the rhetoric of certain tales to tweak us like a dirty joke, mostly I just felt awkward hearing it. I wished he'd developed maturity earlier in life and we weren't reading about a kid who could be on an episode of Jackass today.<br /><br />I realize, perhaps more on reflection than reading, that this is what Bukowski wants to present. The fact that it's a bestial world for him, and that among the abused poor there's not the sense of shame or justice that we know in more fortunate circumstances. It offends our tastes, and he of course wants to offend that very thing at every turn because then we can't escape the question of what this world is really about in his view.<br /><br />I would consider Ham on Rye a very challenging read if you don't share an extreme nihilistic streak with the author. The book is without a doubt a rage-filled assault on the bed covers people have drawn over all the dark and dreary things in society. It's like an alcoholic vomiting his past up to you... except he's got an evil abusive father standing next to him with a strop raised, making sure he doesn't describe anything positive he's done. We're often left wondering where Bukowski's heart fell in the situations that are supposed to be autobiographical. Is his life a tragicomedy to him? Did he weep over these things many times, but refuses to share that bit of vulnerability with us? We never quite know, as he paints himself as some larger than life tough guy and that only other people having feelings, and it can make the story frustrating.<br /><br />Bukowski pretty much paints all human beings as doomed to birth circumstance. He doesn't point out what prodigies were in the midst of the poor community, ever. He refuses to acknowledge that any have got ahead, or that abstaining from the craziness he indulged in with alcohol and being a tough guy could help someone else. He creates a world where it's the world's fault about everything and human beings are just empty vessels for anarchy. He is essentially being a proponent of the criminal's view that none of his choices were really his choices. Is that admirable? No I think it's myopic, self-sabotaging, and excuse to be a jerk, but he has the right to present whatever view he wants. Just be aware that it could easily offend your socks off.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars as a neutral rating. I don't mind being challenged to a different viewpoint, but I didn't really take away anything from the book besides the struggle to read something ugly. His poetry gives a lot more well-rounded, human portrait of him to me.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|An engaging novel with several plot twists that lead the reader on a trail of espionage, intrigue and thrills.  Although the storyline is exciting, the believability of the conclusion is thin.
0062082353|4.0|This is an easy to read and easy to understand book. Great mindset of a warrior and family man. This would be a good book for those who want to criticize our military personnel, who are just doing their job. If you don't like the job they are doing, protest a congressman or the white house. Show our troops the support and respect they deserve.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Awesome read, there's almost a musical quality to McCourt' s writing that enables one to hear the lilting Irish accents, hear the sounds and smell the smells of Limerick, and also feel the hunger and desperation this poor family lives with daily. Beautiful, lyrical story, so sad when I reached the last page- I wanted more. Can't rave about this book enough.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|AWESOME series.  If you enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs, you will love this updated version of the same.  With great character development - by the end of the first show you will have the characters you love and the characters you love to hate.

B00BCOGM78|5.0|Short and to the point...<br /><br />Clutch fans will not be disappointed. New to Clutch? Great album to get started. 45 min of good 'ol hard rock. True to themselves, the music, and \\"real\\" in every sense. I love this album, and have listened to it in it's entirety numerous times over and over the last few weeks. Heck, I'll put the whole album on loop and keep listening and listening. To me, it's that good. Have bought plenty albums over the years, forcing myself to listen to \\"let it grow on me\\", etc. Earth Rocker is an instant gratification to my ears. I also LOVE the mix with this album, especially the drums and how nice and clear the ride and high hat cymbals ring on the tracks. Everything else sounds great. The production on this album is quality. BUY IT!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|We enjoy this series.  My sons and I have read all of them and look forward to the next book in the companion series.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I really enjoyed the writing of this book.  It's no wonder why it is considered one of the great war memoirs.  You will not regret purchasing this.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book, and anxiously await the next by William Landay. As a former prosecutor, he knows whereof he speaks, and the writing is taut and careful, the story enthralling. The book is written with the protagonist as narrator, which is a very effective method for this type of story. The characters are very carefully drawn and multi-dimensional; I immediately felt empathy and interest in their activities and thoughts. The end was a total surprise, which only heightened my involvement with the characters and the story, and led me to ruminate on the characters much longer than I normally would have.  I highly recommend this to anyone with any interest in the legal genre of novels, and it also has a well-developed family situation, with an interesting psychological leitmotiv.  A real positive for me personally was the total absence of any inane, distracting and superficial \\"romance\\", which has ruined many an otherwise good novel for me.

B0063GORYU|1.0|App now sports an advertising screen that can take minutes to find the exit key.  These are obtrusive both for the delay in play they cause and the advertising itself.

B000K8EQ5W|4.0|I like how they were mystified about what was going on, I love how they started to communicate and fall in love, I love how he met her when she was younger (while she was unaware) and I love that they met at the end.  I loved the moment when she realized what happened and what to do.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this to keep of my orders and it does everything I could ever want. I would recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The main character was so well depicted that you are sure she is someone who is out there struggling at this very moment.  You love her and hate her at the same time.  A realistic look into the foster care system and the angst of those who experience it.  Yet having said this, in Lanuage of Flowers, I experienced patience and understanding of the people who surrounded the main character that was so unconditional, it touched me in a way no other book has in a long time.

B001DM1VXE|3.0|This is Doctor Who meets low-budget-film-student-master-thesis project. And, if you are into that sort of thing, I think you will like it. But the praise heaped on this film by other reviewers may be a little too strong.<br /><br />Pi is shot in artistically indulgent grainy black and white. Considered in that milieu, it's a high performer. But in absolute terms - it's no great shakes. Some of the acting is good, and the main idea under the plot is very good. What's more, a few pieces of the cinematography are extremely well done. But overall, the film is lacking.<br /><br />The film's main weakness is that it is very, very slow. At 1 hour 25 minutes, it is just far too long. Pi could have said what it had to say in a TV hour (that is, 44 minutes or so, leaving time for commercials). Or even less.<br /><br />One thing in the film was superlative: The soundtrack. Clint Mansell's score is amazing. Now that I look him up on imdb, I see that I must not be the only person who thought so. After Pi, his first film, Mansell got a flood work afterward. He certainly deserved it.<br /><br />All in all, a good effort, but not, in my opinion, worth quite the level of accolades other reviewers have given it

The acting is great, Johnny Depp gets to play guitar and he's good (I wanted more), and Dame Judy Dench does a very convincing Armand. The photography and editing is very good.  There is also a deeper theme that runs through the story that has made Chocolat my favorite Easter-time movie.

B007XF4J70|5.0|If there is someone on the face of God's Green Earth that has not seen this film — but can read — then by all means go to the Amazon library of films and get this on Blu-Ray!  NOW!  The added technology makes this almost a new movie!  Fine detail and a wonderful sound track make this an even better film this time around.  Some folks might think that Blu-Ray is wasted on B&W movies...  NOT SO!  The creative minds of cinematographers can leave you with a 3-D impression, as the old blur is gone and is right up front in detail.  There are some films that the better critics/reviewers recommend almost instantaneously, and this one is on their list, and if not at the top, very close indeed.  Mostly what one might refer to as film noir — and there's nothing wrong with that  — it just carries along like a wonderful river of acting should carry a film!  Please also make time for the &#34;extras&#34;, as they make a good story on their own.  And PUL-EASE!  Do not misquote the lines... If you can help it.

The handle has two finger choils (grooves for pointer and middle finger) which means your hand size has to conform to the choils exactly or it doesn't fit and is uncomfortable.<br />Came very dull and the grind from the factory was WAY off center along the whole edge of the blade. Also, The blade is a recurve or \\"S\\" shaped which means it is hard to sharpen without specific sharpening tools. Flat stones do not work well on this style of blade.<br /><br />I recommend that you look at the SCHF9 as a \\"do-it-yourself\\" project knife and that you own a grinder to make major corrections.<br />Handle Modifications: I ground off the second finger ridge and reduced the size of the rubberized handle along the spine in order to improve the grip.<br />Blade Modifications: I reshaped and removed quite a bit of the cutting edge of the blade with a grinding wheel to make it true enough to sharpen at a 25 degree angle.<br />The bottom line...This knife more closely resembles a hatchet in performance. Good as a branch cutting, wood splitting tool but too thick and heavy for more intricate use.<br /><br />Update: Loaned the knife for a weekend camping trip to my 14 year old nephew and told him to beat the heck out of it. He did. 4 screws out of 8 that hold the handle grips on fell out and the protective coating on the blade didn't hold up well either.<br />I removed the grips and protective coating with paint stripper and steel wool to expose carbon steel blade.<br />Now the knife is fun. Look up \\"Forced Patina\\" on YouTube for artistic ways to \\"trick-out\\" your blade. Find a good piece of 1 inch thick wood for grips. Draw a line around the shank and cut out with a jig saw. Cut wood in half to make both sides of handle, drill holes and attach, then carve and sand to your own hand size. It's still an elongated hatchet but it looks cool.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I didn't know many of the details of the cause of WWI, except that some archduke got killed, and the war began.  There was so much more to it, and I enjoyed learning about the various countries involved and their motives for fighting.  The story was very interesting tying in characters from the various countries involved.  Another wonderful novel by Ken Follett
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I just wish I had more energy. I run out to quickly but I don't want to stop playing. But it is very fun. My kids even enjoy it!!!

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great little game.  Once you get used to the controls you end up spending a lot of time playing.
B009NQXXZ6|4.0|Although it's not listed on Amazon, the blu ray contains language tracks (besides English) in French, German, Spanish, Italian and Czech.  I'm studying Italian, and it was fun to hear the characters talk in that language (including cuss words).  Of course, it's mono, not surround, but I can then watch it again in English 5.1.  The songs, of course, are all in English, but the transitions were smooth.  This movie brought back memories for me, as Evergreen was one of the songs we played at my wedding in 1977.  This movie was shot when the braless look was very popular, as most of the women weren't wearing them.  The concerts at the start really captured the wildness of the era.  Very enjoyable.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Beautiful music, beautiful artwork, great little story for any age. To bad snowmen don't really come to life isn't it?
B00008CMR6|5.0|Quality of movie was good.  I would recommend it to a friend.<br />I received the movie quickly.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B008220DIC|1.0|This is definitely a love it or hate it movie. I would suggest renting it, and then buying it if you loved it. This was my hubby's buy, not mind. But my main complant about this is that you pay so much for the blu-ray, and when we got it the box and cover print looks really crappy  bootleg cover or someone printed it from a crappy copy printer.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A quick, easy read with interesting anecdotes and brief (very brief) references to relevant research. It's a lot like listening to your middle-aged mother or aunt tell stories from her business career. As one who has been there and done (some of) that, much of it rings true, but it's still a very limited perspective on how to survive in what is still very much a businessman's world.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Downloaded this because of Radioactive, which I love. However, each song has a different vibe to it. Most of these songs I really like. Its almost like listening to a handful of bands on the same album.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|One of my all-time favorites; I am happy to see the classic science fiction great books coming to Kindle. This one also includes (as an appendix) an alternate &#34;updated&#34; beginning written in 1989.
B004FLKV5O|4.0|Barenboim,cast, performance all great but 1994 recording catches stage noise i find distracting. I question why 20 years later it was not possible to make more pristine copy.
B00BOL126U|4.0|After seeing how the small screen mangles history (\\"The Tudors\\" comes to mind), it's generally wise to avoid television's hysterical historical soap operas...but The Vikings is one big exception.<br /><br />Perhaps it is simply because I don't know enough about the Norsemen to point and scoff when they pull off an egregious screw up, so I can just sit back and watch the blood flow. And flow it does!  The battle scenes are soaked in the stuff...the Vikings are smeared, splashed, polkadotted and generally bedaubed with grue. Even the ocean sometimes runs red with it.  And these guys have some serious weapons.  No effete little daggers or delicate epees.  Hatchets, Axes, broadswords...if it's big and sharp, it's all good.<br /><br />This is the story of Ragnar Lothbrok, his family and his crew (crew being used both in the sense of The Sopranos and shipmates.) Ragnar is based on real character in Norse legend, a farmer with an urge to explore. And being a Viking, an even more compelling urge to thwack with his axe. And to commit a bit of plundering while he's at it. The word 'Viking' means raider, and for good reason. Ragnar is married to shieldmaiden Lagartha, that title being given to women who prefer thwacking to weaving and baking.  In Episode 1, we see her take on two burly attackers and make them sorry they weren't more polite; By Episode 3, we understand this is not a woman you'd want to confront at a Donald Pliner sample sale. Let her have the strappy sandals. Just walk away.<br /><br />In the series, which is set somewhere around the year 800, the Vikings are unaware of any lands to their West (which sounds dodgy to me). They have heard of England but don't necessarily believe it exists outside of legend. Or at least Earl Haraldsen (earl being his title, not his name, and the Big Gammelost in town)doesn't and he decides what everyone else should or should not believe. The evidence is on his side; ships that sail west tend to disappear.<br /><br />Ragnar is played by Travis Frann. If they are not using some computer trickery to enhance them, he has the bluest eyes of any human on the planet. I mean, not just blue, but I'm Melting, melting, melting Blue. That kind of blue. His wife is also a beauty. Unfortunately she sports a Real Housewives of New Jersey teased beehive and eye make up has more than a touch of Passaic about it.<br /><br />Haraldsen is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is almost always good in any role and who is masterful in this one. He's not on screen all that much, but his character is the most interesting.  Haraldsen is a greedy and shortsighted man. A conniver, sneak and liar.  But that, he maintains, is how you hold onto your earldom. He has lost his 3 sons and heirs, but nevertheless in exchange for 20 pieces of silver, marries off his very young daughter to an Earl of Sweden. (He had some stuff Haraldsen been needin' -- sorry that just snuck out.)  He justifies the match to his wife by saying this ensures her safety...he saw his sons' dead bodies, mutilated, buried with their heads against their buttocks to humiliate them, and will do anything to safeguard the girl...even marrying her to Santa's ugly older brother. So maybe it's not just the money...<br /><br />In an early episode, Ragnar gets his hands on a revolutionary piece of new technology--a compass. With it, he can navigate a true course, rule the seas and find all those rich lands just lying there, ripe for the plucking. If there is an England, he's determined to find it and plunder it for all it's worth, Big Cheese or no Big Cheese edicts to the contrary. This voyage sets off an entire series' worth of fierce battles, betrayals, schemings, wheelings and dealings, pillagings, burnings and other and assorted bloody mayhem.  One thing about Vikings, they didn't just sit around playing cards after dinner.<br /><br />The scenes of Viking home life are particularly interesting and I'm intrigued enough to want to find out more. For instance, Ragnar happily offers his wife to a houseguest. And one of his crew does the same with his mate, providing a guest with just another amenity the way you or I might offer coffee and brandy after dinner.  I wonder if this is based in fact. And did some Viking warriors wear eye make up?  Floki, a key member of Team Ragnar albeit somewhat nutty, sports those Alice Cooper raccoon eyes.  Of course since he's a Viking, he could wear a feather boa and it would be wiser just not to say anything, but still, it piques the curiousity.  So do the conversations about Odin and Thor and Valhalla.  There is more to these people than kornmjolsgrot and blaber!<br /><br />Since Norse history was passed down orally until the 13th century, it is difficult to know where fact ends and legend takes over. Obviously this gives the series' writers considerable leeway. If they have taken liberties, so be it. What they give us in return is a beautifully filmed, overwhelmingly violent, multifaceted and extremely watchable television series. Not quite a five star effort, but certainly worth Four big ones.ppily offers his wife to a houseguest.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This has been an accurate useful app. Quick, easy, and self explanatory even for beginners.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a weather app. It has moving radar images, hourly temp predictions and you can add multiple cities to your queue. I really love that.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|Warning: A minefield of Spoilers!<br /><br />Downton Abbey is addictive, especially if you opt for the Britisn version, not the somewhat dumbed down version edited for American tastes. The saga of an aristocratic British family in the years just before and after the first World War, it's a gorgeous look at the fashions, morals, social distinctions and events of the era. Sometimes it's a little overwrought, but when you're watching, you get so caught up, it's all good.  Season one introduced us to The Earl of Grantham, his wife and mother, his three daughters, the various servants, and Matthew Crawley, the new heir to the estate. Season two revealed the on again off again love affair between Matthew and Daughter Mary. Season 3 was even better and kept us enthralled with what those Crawleys were up to now. We were happy in our little fool's paradise...until that last episode.<br /><br />Matthew Crawley is like one of those Good News/Bad News jokes.  Downton Abbey is entailed. That means it can only be inherited by the closest living male relative to the current owner.  That's good news for Matthew...turns out, he's the only living heir.  The bad news? The family thinks he's a dork.  The good news, they have a beautiful daughter named Mary. Matthew likes her. A lot. Bad news? She thinks he's a major dork.  Good News: She suddenly has a change of heart. Bad news? Because if she marries Matthew, the state passes to her son and stays in the family. Good News, she changes her mind Bad news: It's too late, Matthew has met someone else even though he still loves Mary.<br /><br />It goes on and on and on this way. WWI intervenes and poor Matthew is MIA and then found. Twice. He's killed in action at least once, but VOILA! it's a mistake. He's fine. Ooops, no, he's seriously wounded. But he recovers. One problem gets settled and another appears.  The estate is bankrupt and then a timely inheritance makes it solvent again. Finally, in Season 3, all the problems seem to be sorting themselves out and despite one heart-breaking family tragedy, we are smiling through our tears. Watching that final Season 3 episode, we are lulled into a false sense of security...and that's when the writers stick a shiv into our hearts.<br /><br />Not fair. Not nice and not fair. I would be devastated, but I have one desperate hope left.  Matthew has been put through the wringer for all 3 seasons and he just keeps coming back, so i have my fingers crossed that this is going to be fixed in Season 4.  Even if the writers have to come up with a \\"Dallas\\" like dream ending. I don't care I just want them to fix it.ng themselves out and despite one heart-breaking family tragedy, we are smiling through our tears.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|This book repeated a lot of things that have been addressed before without offering any real solutions. It also did not address the core issue of government policies like maternity leave.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I had read the 50 shades first.  It took me a while to get into this one, but after a couple chapters I was enjoying the read.
B008220D7S|4.0|Not the funniest Apatow movie, but it has a great cast and some wonderful humor. Paul Rudd is great and the supporting cast make it worth it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was really wrong and really surprised by this one! Great acting by these young characters. I sure hope the world doesn't come to that! Scary stuff!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book displayed every emotion. I couldn't put it down! It is a must read, it will be extremely helper for adolescents.

0307887448|5.0|This one will grip you. The story is very engaging and captivates your attention. It's one of those tough to stop reading books. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book even though the writing may not be the best in the world. Who cares? I had fun reading it and that's all that matters. As soon as I finished the book, I immediately went back and started from page 1 again.<br /><br />When I used to play a lot of video games, I had this urge deep within me to not stop, sacrifice sleep to keep playing and when I was away, to come back as soon as possible so I could keep playing. Well, strangely enough, while reading this book I had the same feeling. I wanted to keep playing this game, but in order to keep playing, I had to keep reading.<br /><br />Highly recommend it, it's well worth the read.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|The movie had funny parts but the acting wasn't very good. Paul Rudd had the best skills out of all them and Leslie has had better movies.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|I started listening to Kurt Vile after the release of Smoke Ring for my Halo.  This is an impressive follow up to such a great album.<br /><br />For me, this is the kind of release that I wish all my favorite bands would make:  An album in which every song can be enjoyed.  This is an album on repeat for me without have to skip any tracks.  Almost 70 minutes of great rock.  Thanks Kurt.

B00867GKIK|5.0|When I first saw this movie I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I can't really say why, perhaps I was in a crappy mood that day.  But, when I saw it again, it truly amazed me.  Maybe the experience of watching it in 3D at home just seemed more personal and this is probably the most personal Pixar movie to date.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, this movie is awesome.  I loaned it to a friend who text me 15 minutes into and was angry at me for making her cry.  But after the end of the movie she was thanking me for introducing her to such an \\"amazing\\" movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|A good mix of tunes to listen to for a romantic evening or by oneself. This is definetely a must have,
B004FECNIO|5.0|First of all, a quick rant about reviewing movies.  Not every movie is for everybody which is why, with very few exceptions, you'll find both positive and negative reviews for each of them.  One man's Battlefield Earth is another's Citizen Kane.  But why do people act like their opinion is the only one that matters and those who disagree must be evil?  People write stuff like \\"I can't believe that anybody liked this movie\\" or \\"if you don't like this movie you are an idiot.\\"  How is that constructive?  Besides, comments like that say more about the writer than they do about the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, what about A.I.?  Well, I am a huge sci-fi fan.  I like fast paced action oriented sci-fi and I like slower paced sci-fi too (Solaris, Sunshine, Moon, Gattica, 2001 to name but a few).  I found A.I to be very thought provoking and quite profound.  The question of what moral obligations we have to somebody to whom we've said \\"I will love you forever\\" is fascinating and well handled in this movie.<br /><br />And then there is the movie as a visual feast.  All of the various art departments did an incredible job and you can watch the movie simply marveling at why particular choices in lighting, design, etc. were used at specific times.  And watching Spielberg do Kubrick is also fascinating.  It's as much a collaboration between those two as Raiders was between Spielberg and Lucas.<br /><br />I will say, however, that I have to agree with those who said the original marketing campaign misrepresented the movie.  I think it is not only unfair, but devious when studios do that.  Folks should have an accurate idea of what they are getting themselves into.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie and for some viewers that's a bad thing.<br /><br />I love this movie and enjoy not only the message but all of the artistry involved.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Background about me:<br /><br />I've been PC gaming since 2000 on many FPS titles including: Half-Life, Team Fortress, Unreal Tournament, Natural Selection, and Quake.  I also play RTS titles such as Age of Empires, Warcraft, and Starcraft.  I've even dabbled in MMORPG games over the years with Guild Wars.  I've used many different mice from Logitech to Microsoft to Razer and I have to say that this Gaming Mouse from Anker is exceptional.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />* This mouse is quite light despite its appearance, but with the ability to add weights in as one pleases, this mouse can be can adjusted to be as light or heavy as one would like.<br />* It's sleek, ergonomic design is really comfortable to grasp for just about any gripping style.  Personally, I range from using a \\"claw grip\\" in FPS games to more of a \\"palm grip\\" in RTS games and this mouse allows for comfort in either manner.<br />* IT IS RESPONSIVE!  This mouse is absolutely exceptional when it comes to quick \\"muscle memory\\" style shooting in FPS titles.  It doesn't over or under compensate for movements, it does what you tell it to.  There is no loss of movement data regardless of the DPI you set it to.  I'm one who prefers a lower DPI when PC gaming, and this mouse will allow for you to go anywhere from 200 to 8000 DPI and the mouse stays as accurate as you are and never missing a pixel regardless of how fast or slow you input data.<br />* The extra buttons are easy to click regardless of your grip style and they feel sturdy unlike some other mice I've used in the past that feel like they're almost taped on.  These extra buttons move and feel like a key on a keyboard or your sturdy main left and right clicks so they definitely are intended to be utilized and not just for marketing purposes or looks.  The 3 thumb buttons are really easy to access despite your grip style and don't get in the way during intense gaming moments.  The mouse wheel is slightly smaller and more inset than most mice and this is a really good thing; it responds and wheels just like any other mouse without impeding movement or access, but allows easy access to the buttons ahead and behind the wheel which means ease of use.<br />* The software allows for you to choose your DPI levels so that you can switch to them on the fly and the 4 lights on the side of the mouse are easily visible to let you know what DPI preset you've swapped to.  You also can program the buttons to do anything you'd like in any way you'd like.  It's liberating to be able to customize a mouse so much and then dive right into a game and be in control of the experience.<br />* The software is easy to use for setting up just about anything any typical gamer would utilize concerning button function, DPI, sensitivity, click speed, pointer speed, and polling rate (up to 1000hz).<br />* The macro software is exceptional in being able to customize how many loops and a specific delay between clicks or commands that you can customize either all at once or one by one giving you all the freedom you need from your macros.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />* The macro customization is great and well tuned, but it's a little tricky to get at with the current software setup.  The macro manager is actually accessed from the software where you'd set up one of the buttons to perform a function which is kind of an awkward place.  The way to record macros is a little indifferent as I found that I had to record \\"on-the-fly\\" macros, and then adjust them in the software to really make them feel like they were doing what I wanted them to do.  I feel like this is something that definitely will be adjusted in the future and will update this review accordingly.<br />* I prefer a lower DPI and as such I like to be able to fine tune in increments of 100's of DPI, but the software currently only allows increments of 200 DPI.  I've since adjusted with sensitivity and whatnot, but have had to adjust to a 600dpi instead of my typical 500dpi.  I alsothink that this may be something that will be adjusted in the future.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is an exceptional gaming mouse that I would easily choose over other mice that are double or triple its price. I feel like Anker has done the PC gaming community a favor and put a better gaming experience at a more affordable cost on the market with their High Precision Gaming Mouse.  If you are tired of your mice becoming worn and broken down in a short time despite spending $80 or more on them, I urge you to do the right thing and get yourself an Anker High Precision Gaming Mouse.  You will be glad you did so.think that this may be something that will be adjusted in the future.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is an exceptional gaming mouse that I would easily choose over other mice that are double or triple its price.

0062014536|4.0|I generally don't like love triangles. So, it is a little surprising to note that I liked this series and specifically this book, since there is definitely one in Requiem. Let me tell you, this is a tough triangle too! Both relationships actually worked for me, so trying to work out which one I liked better and knowing either way Lena went was going to be heartbreaking in one way or another was a little depressing. I'm not saying that I didn't know who I wanted her to choose, I did (Alex!!!). It's just that the circumstances that developed each of Lena's relationships with Alex and Julian were both so real, gritty, and meaningful. There is no instant-love or easy here. Both relationships were developed through an entire book with plenty of challenges in the way. SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't read the other books in this series, then you may want to skip the next paragraph. :)<br /><br />Alex is a vital part of Lena's life in the first book. He's the instigator or the spark that turns over what she has already been struggling with or trying to decide. He's the main reason she ends up leaving. I loved Alex in Delirium! So heartbreaking! Then in Pandemonium Lena has changed so much because of what has happened. She's not sure about trying to love someone again, but Julian kind of sneaks in there anyway. She has just decided to really let him in and then Alex reappears. I really wasn't sure which way Oliver was going to go. Again, either way is heartbreaking in some way, even though I was rooting for Alex.<br /><br />Of course the love triangle isn't the only thing going on. There's Hanna and her intended or \\"matched\\" husband, who I really, really disliked. Hanna is torn between her former memories and who she has become or at least who she thinks she has become. I loved her character! The struggle she is going through, the relationships she is dealing with, and her choices!<br /><br />Then there is the society and its conflicts. Are the \\"diseased\\" going to be completely destroyed? Will Hana's match, who will be the new mayor of Portland, get his way?

B00BF11STU|4.0|Good blend of action, and political talk going on over the incident.  Should make clear it's still not an actual account of the events.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|It is a good prequel and has info about the history of the characters from Blood and Sand. I recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm skeptical of a lot of &#34;best new&#34; books, but I got a sample of this on my kindle and decided to keep going.  I am really glad I did!  Once  you hit about the halfway mark, your mind will be blown and you will not be able to put it down.  It inspired me to read her other two books as well, and I'm nearly done.  All really interesting, well written mysteries.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. BUT THE ONLY THING IS YOU NEEEEED SKINS AND SPAWN EGGS. OH YEAH MOJANG KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK IT IS AWESOME
B005LAII1C|2.0|nothing really happens in this movie yet somehow they manage to stretch it to about two hours. mark walhberg's character messes up and begs mila kunis' character to give him another chance, the cycle is repeated two or three times and then ted gets kidnapped because some guy \\"really wanted him\\". everything from the writing, to the font chosen for the opening/closing credits, to the background music for the action scenes towards the end of the movie, made this feel like a long mediocre episode of 'family guy'. at least on 'family guy' there are cutaway scene that are setup through dialogue. it feels like seth macfarlane has gotten so used to this format because you can see the writing get almost dangerously close to setting up a cutaway scene. the writing feels a bit limited or held back because of this. mark wahlberg's accent is pretty bad also...<br /><br />all in all, i chuckled a couple times throughout the flick so i didn't give it one star.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Absolutely the ONE and ONLY CD of Les Miserables that will blow you away! Music is superb, more than divine, and will bring you to tears--even if you listen in your car! Each and every singer in this Dream Cast will rock you to the very last note! It is  a MUST HAVE version that you will listen to over and over!  In a word: AWESOME!!!
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|truth be told, because i don't like to read too much about such a highly acclaimed film, i honestly thought this film was about the americans being held hostage in the american embassy/consulate. the ones that had the unsuccessful rescue attempt that ultimately sank president carter's prospects for re-election in 1980. instead, this film is about a successful and unconventional rescue attempt for a separate group of americans whom were hiding in the canadian consulate. whether the suspense-related elements of the plot were historical accurate or poetic license added for story-telling purposes, i'm not sure. but by contrast to the failed military rescue attempt, this story highlights a successful, non-violent rescue attempt made possible by the creativity of american ingenuity. the film has a great cast and a few unexpected moments of humour to boot.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is by far my favorite book! Twists and turns at every flip of a page! I honestly couldn't put the book down!
0439023521|5.0|I waited quite a while to read these books, because of all the hype and the waiting list at the library.  However, when I did get to them, I thoroughly enjoyed them, every one.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|I saw this movie at a drive-in when I was a kid. Liked it then & still do. It got me hooked on science fiction books & movies.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a well written and well structured thriller.  Getting used to the Scandinavian names takes a bit of time but is not too dificult.  This is one of those books that you don't want to put down until the end.  I highly recommend this book, as well as the two other books in the series.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|my first NS book, I enjoyed it. I liked the characters, there was too much weirdness provided about the 'bad husband' but I guess you needed to really dislike him which wasn't hard.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Beetlejuice  was not viewed for a long time because of the title...but I have found this to be a very funny movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'd be more upset, but I love Tolkien and his books so much, that I can't get angry for having bought this one.<br />It will be fun to compare this one with the Extended version when it comes out at the end of the year!<br /><br />This does come with a sneak peek of the next movie and other bonus features and it's great fun to watch it.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)  *** This version would be great for taking on the road and leave the Extended version back a home out harm's way.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|We've watched this movie a couple of times and have found it extremely informative and a beautiful portrayal of this time in American history.  Being a Black woman, and growing up during the time depicted in this film,  I can remember a lot of things that were portrayed in the film and what took place in that time era.  I didn't grow up in the South, but knowing what was taking place there gave me a feeling of fear if I had traveled there.  This movie opened a lot of doors and has helped to erase those fears.  I now have a respectful outlook on the South.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm not a big Temple run fan but I love this game! Way easier to play.Fun and has great graphics. My grandson loves it too.
B0073PPNE8|2.0|Don't we love to be transported to another time, place?  Handsome faces, lovely scenery, enchanting music.  Brutal people, war and suffering.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved this book! The characters are complex and there is so much going on you can't sleep until you finish the book. I can't wait to read the next book.
0393317552|3.0|Diamond is not a particularly straightforward writer. In this book, he goes off on needless tangents in an effort to support his claims, rather than citing more useful sources than his own opinion of previous studies.<br /><br />As a history student, I have a difficult time focusing on his writing because he does bounce around on topics quite a bit. Overall though, it isn't a terrible book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read this book! I love the characters and all the stories going on in the series. The characters are complex and compelling. There is so much going on in this book, I couldn't wait to finish it, and then I couldn't wait another minute to download book 2.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|\\"Gosford Park\\" drowned in treacle. Only saving grace is Maggie Smith, Julian Fellowes is quite a fine writer (see \\"Gosford Park\\"), but this is simply God-awful. Hope the Luftwaffe bombs the place out of existence in Season 6 (World War II)!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I had my macbook stolen and started using my Kindle Fire for surfing and mail. The webmail of my French<br />provider being too unsteady and hopelessly laborious to deal with and too broke to buy another Mac.  I downloaded<br />the new YahooMail app on my Kindle. I love it!<br /><br />3 weeks later... much to my regret:<br /><br />WELL, I had to take it off my Kindle and go back to the old version as a mysterious Outbox appeared<br />that kept processing 4 mails never sent. No way of seeing which ones. I contacted Yahoo! but never got<br />an answer. A bug? Could be i felt it was safer to delete the app.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Interesting adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel by the fine French director Bernard Tavernier, starring Tommy Lee Jones. Main problem is the script, which is fairly incoherent -- but then so was the novel. Most interesting thing about Burke's novels is the interior monologue of the main character, Dave Robicheaux -- the action mainly serves as a catalyst for Robicheaux's commentary. In the movie there's minimal voice-over, which ain't the same. One objection: Robicheaux is slipped some LSD in his iced tea and ends up in the hospital after running his truck into a (shallow) ditch and hallucinating up a storm. The hallucinations, and succeeding flashbacks, involve a philosophical dialogue with a dead Civil War general, who'd fought in the area 100 years before. Sorry, Hollywood: those ain't like any LSD hallucinations I ever experienced -- too clean, to coherent. Tavernier does his best with a weak script (& his work is always worth watching -- see &#34;Round Midnight&#34; as the best example). And Tommy Lee Jones is probably the best Dave Robicheaux we can expect. I had hoped for more, but it appears Burke is as hard to adapt as Richard Stark (Payback, Point Blank, The Outfit).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Tjis is so beautifully written. You can truly see how the narrator feels. The author makes you care about the characters.
B001NLJ33K|2.0|Really bad. And I was so looking forward... Michael Mann -- one of my favorite directors. Gong Li -- one of the great actors in screen history. Wasted effort. And the &#34;Director's Cut&#34;? Couldn't tell the difference from the original - just longer boring. At least Mann didn't bugger it up the way he did with the Director's Cut ending of &#34;Last of the Mohicans&#34;.
B007R21JJK|4.0|This motherboard is very good if you want to build a gaming computer as it can accommodate two video cards for maximum graphics performance. The install is very easy and went smoothly thanks to the instructions in the manual and it accommodated all my other hardware perfectly. My only main complaint is that the audio drivers that come with the motherboard are very hard to use and contain very few options to customize your audio. It also doesn't work properly with my setup with a monitor that has built-in speakers as when I launch a game occasionally sound will come out of the speakers and I will have to plug and unplug my headphones a few times until it switches to them. Also when I unplug my headphones the audio does not work until I manually set the monitor as the default sound source in windows. Be careful when getting this if you have a display that supports sound output. Otherwise great mobo.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|But glad I'm here. This game isn't new a year or so ago I use to get requests to play it until I bought my second Kindle that I downloaded it I love it.very addicting
B00AW0KGYI|4.0|While a lot of the movie is really slow, eventually the action picks up and gets a little more interesting. Hopefully the last one is as good as the book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love anything tolken. With Peter Jackson at the helm It&#34;s going to be good. A little Disappointed about 3 movies, but when you really think about it, It can't be done in 1 movie and be really indepth. Great Job Love it. If you love The Hobbit, to see it in live actionIt is wonderful Awesome job buy it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a fun movie, even if I didn't realize the story was a 3 part one. I remember these stories from when I read them as a kid.
1475972350|3.0|For first time writer Todd Thiede, Time Killer is not a bad read.  It read like a script for a great thriller like Criminal Minds.  The grisly details of the murders were captivating for this reader.  I enjoyed ever chapter devoted to the killer.  However, I found the two detectives quite boring.  When first we meet Max and Jessie, I got an image of their personalities based on the authors description.  Max came off as a chauvinistic macho jock and Jessie as a very strong, determined woman.  But I found their dialogue did not match their personalities.  Soon into the story, they even seemed to blend.  All in all, it was an enjoyable read.
B003ZSISGM|4.0|Unnecessary details slowed the story down, but it was a good mystery and overall exciting.  I would have enjoyed it much more had it been a bit more condensed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book was surprised about the ending and who the boy is she ends up with ... Great book .... loved it
0385349947|5.0|I hear all of the flack about this book, but I have to wonder, have these people actually read or listened to this book in its entirety?  I listened to this book on audio, even though I'm an avid reader, I was in the final week of a graduate course and did not want to read another thing.  The book is wonderful!!  I don't think you have to agree with everything Sheryl states to be able to take away some really great advice.  The added bonus of listening to this as an audio book was my children and husband also were able to hear what Sheryl had to say and we were able to discuss this topic in a meaningful way.  I really recommend this book as a need to consider opinion.  In life a choice is when you have options, gathering different perspectives helps to empower both men and women.  As much as this is a book for women, it is a book for men.  As a mom who returned to school after spending 15 years as a stay-at-home mom, I can say this book has genuine guidance.  I think it was Tony Robbins that said he want to seminar after seminar and if he learned one thing then it was worth it.  I think most people can learn more than a few things from this book, even the scientific results she cites is worth the book alone.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Pine and Quinto did a fabulous job playing Kirk and Spock...and Lt. Ohura and Spock...didn't see that coming..but glad I did :-)
0425252868|5.0|This is a very inspiring book.  It was hard to put this book down.  It was especially interesting to see the German side of the story along with the American side of the story.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed most of this book, but found parts of it a little slow. Overall  it was a good page turner. I recommended it  to my wife
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Just challenging enough to make it last awhile.  Music is entertaining as well.  Could use some power ups.  Would recommend.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Phenomenal music! Voice incredible, great variety of songs, sleeve with lyrics. So in love with this music that I've ordered more cd to share with friends and family.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book. I love all of the twilight series.l think this is one of the best books in the series.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie arrived quickly and as stated.  My daughter loves this movie.  I have no complaints about anything here. Love
B005PK553C|5.0|If American Horror Story Season 1 was a book, it would be a page-turner!  It is scary, thrilling, mysterious and unpredictable. I love watching it on my Kindle because I can watch episodes back-to-back; I don't have to wait a whole week in between.  The casting is superb with actors playing their roles to a &#34;T.&#34;.  Each character is well-developed and believable.  Can't wait to watch Season 2!
1419705849|5.0|i got this book for my son for xmas he read it about 7 times recommend new product shipped good
B003K16P3M|4.0|A really good book with a realistic kind of ending. Struggle for survival isn't easy when a kingdom is out to get you so there are bound to be injuries and quarrels. A touching romance that struggles to survive under the threat of death.  The next book in the series looks promising.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Ordered this for Mom and she is addicted to the series.  She plans on revisiting all seasons to get ready for season four.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The major significant changes in society incorporated with the history of the war topped by the strong personalities of the novel made it a winner for me!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|The page at the top of the stairs, where an item was under the Fire's settings tab at the right side of the page and could not be selected, nor could anything go on from there.  FIRST tap Menu at the top left of the page. THEN tap Options - it's the second, or middle, choice. NOW tap the radio button under the two sliders for volume that says \\"Keep Aspect Ratio.\\" LAST tap OK at the bottom of the dialog box. The picture will pull inward, and you will be able to select the item that was under the Fire's tab. Hurray, hurray, hurray!!! The game will go on.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I am reading all the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.  I find them interesting, different, long and well written.  One thing I know I have to finish them even though I know pretty much how it will end.  I enjoy reading and have my list of authors I read and am<br />usually reading about three hours a day. (retired)  I seem to stick with authors I like and usually get their new books when they<br />come out.  Love my kindle - take it everywhere<br />Carole Dolan
B0096BIENY|5.0|I've never played a CD so much and still love listening to it, even my kids love it.  I just wish I discovered them sooner.  The combination of music styles is meaningful for someone like myself who likes operatic music but can never appreciate it fully because of not knowing much about the story and language of the most operas.  The contemporary song choices fills that gap and enjoy it much better regardless of what language is used.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read this book after waiting for forever for it to come down to a reasonable price ( it is an e-book after all ). Well, I kept waiting for it to get to the good part and waiting and waiting. Actually, I am still waiting! I thought it was good but honestly not that good. I have read better books for $.99 and this one was $3.99 on SALE. I read this because of all the glowing reviews but I was not impressed like I have been with other authors. I will not be buying the next in the series because it just did not suck me in. I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but I cannot get that as an option. Spend your money elsewhere and borrow this from a friend because if you love books as I do you will feel cheated.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I feel like people will automatically dismiss an album by a band or singer because it sounds different that the album before it. Would you prefer an artist stays exactly the same and keeps producing the same music over and over? The 2nd Law seems to be a bit more experimental for Muse but this is still Muse. It took me a few listens to really get into it but now I'm enjoying it. Not my favorite Muse album but still very solid.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I do not like it. It is not fun.it is not a challenge. No excitement.  To slow it is not for me
B0007ODLCS|5.0|Townes is the most underrated singer/songwriter ever! His songs are timeless. He left us much too soon, but left us with such great songs as Pancho and lefty and For the Sake of the Song. This Masterpeice was a bargain!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome it is a great game every body should buy it you get to go to different places all the time.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Have been listening to Van Morrison since the 60s. He gets better with time! this is an excellent, moving CD! Top notch!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Mark Watney was a team member, but now he was alone.  Just him and the deserted equipment, all left behind by the Mars exploration team.  Does Mark spend his time hating, or does he shed all remorse and focus on his survival?  The options are his to peruse.<br /><br />The crew, less one noteworthy character in his mind anyway, is in route to Earth.  The next Mars exploratory team is hundreds of days away from arrival.  How to survive must be Mark’s only concern?  Oh, and how to communicate with Earth for starters.  The terrible storm that drove them off the planet also destroyed key communications equipment.  Think Watney, you can do this!<br /><br />The story moves quickly and interlaces Mark Watney’s journal into the fabric of the story, giving you both a view into his tenuous interactions with other people, and his personal coping process with himself.  What would you do so far from home, all alone with a pile of broken toys and your drive to survive?
B00004W510|5.0|I think that this is The Band's best album. Its also remastered and had additions that are really interesting.. materpiece!
B000001ELR|5.0|One of KISS' stand out albums. Hard Rock at its best with the addition of drummer Eric Carr. Noteable songs:Title Track, I Love It Loud, I Still Love You, Rock and Roll Hell.
B005F9TQ2Y|4.0|Certainly not his best, but not his worst either. Worth a listen. Highlite of the Cd is Jokerman.Great,powerful song! Dylan was finding his place again. Still the master songwriter!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Tried other note apps and this is the first one that I keep using. Very useful. I even use it across three different machines.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|If you are a Dylan fan, Tempest is a must have! it is todays dyaln at his best. The songwriting is impecable!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The plot was fascinating and kept me reading. But I'm not a mathematician and whole pages devoted to calculations figuring out how much water or air or food he'd need per day started to get to me after a few chapters. I ended up skipping them before long. Ditto very long explanations of how he fixed something.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|THIS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EVERY CHILD TO READ AROUND 6TH OR 7TH GRADE!!<br /><br />I am stunned that this little book could be so life changing and raw. His view of life and struggle completely changed my outlook!<br /><br />READ IT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU ARE NOT CHANGED!
B00BQUUH7E|2.0|Ice Rage is short and the game mechanics are wonky, in my opinion it is not really worth paying for.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Again: You can watch it work (see the picture I've uploaded). That sold me, instantly, despite the over-inflated MSRP that's very misleading ... this is the best price I've seen on this watch, and it's perfectly suited for me. My 'fancy' watch? I'm afraid to wear. My Swiss Army is extremely heavy, and just about too heavily worn.<br /><br />They shoulda added video, 'cause this thing's simply a joy to watch ... the second hand ticks five times per second, and will sneak up about 20 seconds per day. Provided that it was worn the day before. No battery, and no winding, means you gotta wear it, or reset it. And, when you do that? Always wait 'til the second hand reaches the 12:00 position before pullin' the know out (or pushin' it all the way in).<br /><br />What I like most, save for the fact that you can see the intricate movement, and listen to it wind/tick, is that it's clean, well crafted and simple; quietly understated, 'til given a closer look.<br /><br />For all women, to whom their man is too kind to admit you choose gifts poorly? Get him this. I mean, it ain't no Rolex (it's a Malaysian movement, but still a Seiko). But, when you can get one of these for only about half again more than a Timex costs? You could buy him a spare one, too.
B007HACDLK|4.0|It's not the best of the series, but if you enjoy the series, this is a good read. I'd recommend it.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|If you just want to rock out and have a good time then get this album. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoy it so get ready, It's party time!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my first Reacher novel (why not start with #1 right) and I loved it. I'm quickly reading through the entire Lee Child library.
B000002IJO|5.0|This album takes me back to the 80's. I remember the song body talk from the movie The Golden Child which is one of my favorite movies! A must have for any Ratt fan!
B005HT400A|5.0|It's great to see Blue Velvet released in a strikingly beautiful HD release. Colors pop and the sound nicely mixed. Blue Velvet has never looked so good!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|If you are looking for a sweet tale this is perfect. the writing is good, but dwells too much, the characters are all OK, but for me it missed a bit of a bite. I wanted to feel the earth in the garden, I wanted to sweat with the characters and I couldn't
0486448843|5.0|These cards are reproduced for the most part beautifully. Some of the colors are a bit dim, but overall, I am very happy with them. There is quite a good selection as well. Most importantly, the people who've received them are thrilled with them. They come 4 to a perforated page, so each card will have 2-3 perforated edges. But I have bought so many of these economical 24-postcard books that I invested in a $15 paper trimmer, and it's quick and easy to trim the edges.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|although there were some holes in the plot, particularly at the end, it was a good read and one I could not put down!
B0050R0XPA|4.0|Lego toys are fun to build but are very fragile. The toy will fall apart if played witth. My daughter built this in about 30 minutes.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a grand read. I loved the young woman and her antagonistic ways  towards  everyone. She was no sweet petunia, nor could she ever be....more like a  cactus throwing off her spines. I am usually mild but while I read this book, I growled along with the heroine and felt her deep primitive ways of defense. The author get into the very core of our lead character!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best game ever I think it is better than these other sickish games. You should get it it's worth it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I felt informed and loving and caring all through the book. there was just enough of everything in this book. adventure personal problems, caring and sharing...I loved the interplay of family in this too.

1932100660|5.0|Wow, I just finished this book on an international flight. Halfway through, I asked the flight attendant to please change my meal to the vegetarian meal and was saddened to see the very overweight man in the row across from me eating his Filet Mignon. I can not believe how misinformed we are as a society, I have always been physically active and fit my entire life and thought that consuming high amounts of animal protein was essential for my health and for muscle growth. Thank you Dr. Campbell for opening my eyes and starting me on a journey to a plant based diet. I know it will be hard, but I am committed to changing my health and those around me that I love.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Definitely more than worth your 9 dollars! You don't even have to be a fan of the game to appreciate the music on this album; it works just as well as a heavy metal/rock compilation on its own merits.
034580404X|5.0|Wonderful book for adults!! The author did an awesome job! I hope she comes out with more books soon! A must read!

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I purchased the Phoenix Project after watching author Gene Kim present on DevOps at a conference earlier this year. I hadn't even finished the book when I decided to purchase it for two work colleagues. Since then I have also been imploring others at the office to pick it up, and offered to loan my Kindle copy to them.<br /><br />The book's story and its characters' plight feel very familiar. (It's very easy to identify coworkers in one's own work climate who feel like the characters!) As I read the book I began writing down the techniques they used so I can bring them back to our own environment at work.<br /><br />Think again if you believe this book doesn't apply to you because you're not a software developer or IT operations person! Neither am I! The lessons in the book certainly are dead-on for improving performance between Developers and IT Ops teams, but I'm busy applying them to other disciplines in our office.

B00BYH6MZK|2.0|I love Mark Wahlberg and I bought this movie before it was available to rent because he always does a great job. His acting was great, but the movie just drag on and it wasn't one of those movies that was 'exciting'. It had a good ending, but I barely even watched the whole thing and with Mark Wahlberg in it that says a lot because hes one of my favorite actors. I would rent it maybe, but regret buying it because it was a waste of money.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Accuweather was a succinct app that I could use to get a little weather info. They changed it to make it more complex and less concise.. It gives more info now but is more difficult to use... Back to the Weather Channel app...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok I love subway surfers! It's just I feel like they copy temple run with the whole save me thing added unless there the creators of temple run.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Really challenging games that are fun. Enjoy the three variations. I start the one-minute games to just play for ONE MINUTE, but always end up playing for MANY MINUTES as I just have to beat my previous round!<br /><br />Wish the scoring was done another way. It flashes too quickly and fades into the background before I've had time to see it. I want to see it!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|The movie  arrived very fast to my home.They were very easy to do business with. I would shop with them again.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|If you use regular face book, you don't need this app. I tried all the different functionality's and found none so profound, that I would continue to use this app
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Bought this as a birthday present for my 9 year old son. He is a Lego fan and he is crazy about Ninjago collection. This is a very simple set and he has no problem fixing it on his own.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|If you're a true Who fan you love all seasons, all episodes!Matt Smith is a quite like able Dr and his companions are all hot (female that is)!Great viewing!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept my interest from the very beginning even though this is not my normal interest in books. I will definitely read the next one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Doing a movie on a real life situation is always difficult but they really pulled it off here. You could feel the fear, tension and the unknowingness the people were going through. Just a very well made movie something you would believe could happen and it was amazing how all angles were looked at to make sure their plan worked as best it could. The fear of failure was always there but Ben Affleck kept it together for the sake of the group even though he feared it may not work. It gives you a gimps into the life of the people who do these missions that don't exist and how much they are giving up to protect others even though they may die in the process. I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew the final result the not knowing what was going to happen next kept the movie flowing.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|It was just like the movie. A enticing story about a rich young woman with a rather high opinion of herself, who confuses several love stories only to finally star in her own.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie has all you expect in an action movie so with that in mind it was good. It just was a bit to predictable and some things you really can't see how it would be possible outside of a lot of luck. I'm not sure but the point seemed to be that as rough around the edges this group is they still get the job done.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I did not like It... I kept hoping that something would happen to change this but it never came... I read it till the end but suffered all the way. How can this be one of best sellers I can not begin to understand.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|What I got out of this movie is even though people do the right thing, having a great outcome giving the situation you can still get burned in the end. It made you think would he had been better off crashing because even though he saved so many lives that didn't make a difference when they started to look at him personally. It reminded me of the real life situation when the pilot landed a plane in the water and saved so many lives but then they came back on him for wrong doings even though it had nothing to do with the plane failure.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love this book! The twist and turns just keep you hooked. Could not put it down! Would recommend this book to everyone!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I enjoy the actors in this movie and that's one reason I chose to watch it. It's a good movie with the action, the pace flowed well and then there was a bit of humor as well. If you like Bruce Willis movies you will like this it's not as action packed as the movies he is known for but still something you can sit back and enjoy.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Chicago is a wonderful show--and it was a wonderful movie...The music is great--and there are some show stoppers--such as He Had It Comin&#34; etc.........A real winner...Barbara Cooper
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this nook. At times it did seem to drag on with more of the same, but it was very good.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|What I love about Dan Ariely, is that he comes up with great ideas for studies, executes them well, and is well aware of the true consequences (i.e. what the reasearch *did* suggest to a high degree, and what could simply have been the result of an external variable). The book reads very smoothly as well.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I have been a Paramore fan for a long time now. They are actually my favorite band. With their previous albums there was tons of energy, charisma, and just plain old good music. When I found out that Josh and Zac Farro left the band I was devastated. They were both major assets to the band.<br />When Paramore came out with their Singles EP without the Farro brothers I was hopeful. Their sound was still pretty much intact. I wasn't left disappointed. A little later \\"Now\\" came out. I liked it but it wasn't quite like the old Paramore. Then \\"Still Into You\\" came out and I was left a little disappointed. Both singles were great, but the signature sound was gone.<br />Well, their CD came out and I bought it anyway. I have to say that the first listen through wasn't doing too much for me. There were some catchy songs here and there, but the Paramore I used to know was gone. Even Hayley's vocals have slightly changed. But the second time listening through it I realized that this album was extremely well written. The album flows so well together and it just puts you in a great mood. I realized that yes, it isn't the old Paramore, but it shouldn't have to be. These songs are amazing songs that get stuck in your head. I constantly find myself singing songs like \\"Grow Up,\\" \\"Ain't It Fun,\\" \\"Part II,\\" and \\"Be Alone.\\"<br />So there you have it from a big fan who was slightly disappointed at first, I give this album five stars. Listen to it once, and then listen to it again and you'll find yourself loving it more and more with each listen. Each song is different so it is definitely not a boring album. They are still Paramore and still bring great music to the table.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Loved it! Great to watch over and over!!!! One to add to the collection. Defiantly can hold the kiddos attention.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The cd was all i expected.  I enjoy listening as I drive..the music is inspiring. Amazon always delivers!!  Glad i ordered this cd.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This was an okay book, however found the lack of translation within the text when the characters spoke French to be annoying and took away from the flow of the book.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|This is where Iron Maiden was at the peak of their career - great lineup, amazing setlist, excellent stage and blazing guitar solos (no Jancik Gers to butcher the solos). Maiden England is a five star metal performance. Highly recommended to all true heavy metal fans.
0061743526|1.0|I was buying and paying for a Hardcover 50th Anniversary Edition, instead I received a normal version paperback. Very conveniently on the package receipt it states not 50th Anniversary Edition. According to this logic you can advertise to sell anything, just make sure the package receipt describing it's not what you are buying. Obviously I want to return the book but I will have to pay the return shipping. I am being penalized for their mistake whether it's intentional or not.
0307960471|4.0|When Harry Hole left us at the end of The Leopard, he was so beaten up and ragged-looking that it seemed to us readers that he'd never survive, much less return for another adventure. But heroes of novels have miraculous powers of recuperation, and Harry arrives Hale and Hearty in a linen suit after spending time in the Orient healing himself.<br /><br />Heading for one of his old haunts, Hotel Leon, in a seamy section of Oslo, he is accosted by a regal looking prostitute:<br /><br />[page 14] The woman's hand rested on his arm as he made to move on. She leaned toward him and breathed red wine into his face.<br />  \\"You're a good-looking guy. How about giving me . . . a light\\"<br />  He turned the other side of his face to her. The bad side. The not-such-a-good-looking-guy side. Felt her flinch and slip as she saw the path left by the nail from his time in the Congo. It stretched from mouth to ear like a badly sewn-up tear.<br />  He walked on . . .<br /><br />This is our Harry, no doubt about it. In town to clear the name of Oleg (18) who was charged with killing another teenaged druggie, Gusto (19). Oleg was his girl friend Rakel's son and likely Harry's own son, and he has come back to dark and dreary Oslo to clear Oleg's name, to find the real killer, but the real killer, the deeper Harry digs, begins to resemble a phantom, while all the police evidence points to Oleg.<br /><br />[page 34] Oleg, who smiles, patiently and indulgently, whenever harry promised that in the autumn or spring they would go to London to see Tottenham playing at White hart Lane. Oleg, who sometimes called him Dad when it was late, he was sleepy and had lost concentration. It was years since Harry had seen him, years since Rakel had taken him from Oslo, away from the grisly reminders of the Snowman, away from Harry's world of violence and murder.<br /><br />Oleg, who said, when Harry visited him in jail as soon as he could, \\"You're no one to us anymore. You were someone who drifted in, hung around for a few years and then . . . gone!\\" Then he called for the guard to take him away from Harry and back to his cell. Harry had a son who would rather die in jail than talk to him. How could he help clear his name without Oleg's help?<br /><br />A burner we discover is someone who destroys police cases. \\"He makes sure that evidence becomes contaminated or goes missing, that mistakes are made in legal procedures, thus preventing a case from being brought to court, or that everyday blunders are made in the investigation, thus allowing the suspect to walk away free.\\" (Page 58) Clearly Oleg didn't have an burner working for him, because an abundance of evidence pointed to him. The case was already old by a year or so and Harry couldn't get anyone interested in helping him re-open it. This would be all on Harry to solve or not.<br /><br />Tutu got his name from a mistake he made placing a bet for his underworld boss. He had been sent with a bag of money to be laundered by placing a bet on a team in a game that was fixed. Tutu was supposed to bet on a 2-0 score for a game which was fixed. However, Tutu's stutter came out as 2-2 instead of 2-0. He was doomed to be kneecapped by his boss for this mistake, but luckily a new Polish forward whose speaking was as bad as Tutu's misheard the fix and played to win and tied the score 2-2. Two wrongs equal a right, but Tutu compounded his first problem by telling his boss that he placed the wrong bet and the boss shot him in knee before Tutu could explain to the boss that he had won anyway! The morale: Always tell the good news first! From that incident Tutu got his name, from his 2-2 bet. (Page 64, 65)<br /><br />Harry's job in Hong Kong was an enforcer for large banks. He had lost part of his finger during the Snowman episode, and had it replaced with a titanium finger tip. Rakel notices it as she makes coffee for Harry.<br /><br />[page 71] While Rakel was making coffee he saw her gaze fix on his metal finger, but neither of them made a comment. There was an unspoken agreement that they would never mention the Snowman. So Harry sat at the kitchen table and instead talked about his life in Hong Kong. Told her what he was able to tell. What he wanted to tell. that the job as \\"debt consultant\\" for Herman Kluit's outstanding accounts consisted of meeting customers with payments that had fallen behind and jogging their memories in a friendly way. In brief, the consultation involved advising them to pay as soon as was practical and feasible. Harry said his major and basically sole qualification was that he measured six feet four in his stocking feet had broad shoulders, bloodshot eyes and a newly acquired scar.<br /><br />Harry Hole's a pretty scary guy at this time in his life, enough to get debtors to pay without having to resort to physical force, as least not so far as he revealed to Rakel.<br /><br />Will Harry get his son Oleg out of jail, will he survive his shooting up with violin and the shooting up at the end of the novel, will the second Medical Examiner find him still alive?

B000BNI90O|5.0|I love the music. Its magical, beautiful, and epic! Even though this cost so much(I never would buy a cd that much) I wanted to get it because the music is so good.It was worth it!!
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I rated this a 3 only cause I did not use it at all...so I can not say if it works like it says it does or not...My kindle came with a video player already on it and so I just uninstalled it right away...Sorry
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I got this after getting the other two. It's amazing hearing how much music they didn't add into the original soundtrack. If your a fan this is a must!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|weird...I already bought this but it told me there was an error and then it took my money and now do I have to buy it again??? It's not appearing in my games!!!
B001TNGOXY|5.0|These are the feel good movies you want to fill your cabinet with. Great price for an upgrade to blu-ray!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My four year old likes to play with pictures, pet the horse and changing the horses image to a unicorn.  He showed me how to feed and mix the oats and grains.  Worth a try!
B007JNR4XW|5.0|I don't know if it's the costumes or the characters or the choreography, but I can never get enough of dance movies. Channing Tatum is very watchable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some infinities are larger than others and lots of people are looking through windows of this crappy disease and finding humongous lunkers.
B008CPRLP2|5.0|It works just like it does in windows. I have nothing bad to say about WinZip. I give a five star.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|The movie was action packed, never a dull moment. I liked the ending. So five stars isn't out of the question.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Everyone should watch this, I remember been a little girl and this was going on. It makes you wonder how much does go on behind the seen. Ben Aflec did a great job in front of the camera and behind the scene.
B000FA675C|4.0|Not to worry- god will not strike you down.  A flood perhaps but, then you are in good company with all
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Was very &#34;on the edge of my seat&#34; throuhout the entire movie. Would say it was great, not always the case if a movie is remade.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this game is fun especially for horse lovers! Very realistic, and it is easy to earn gems and Money in the game unlike some games!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Was great movie fun and laughter, good story line throughout the movie. Was pleasently suprised and would watch it again.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|worth the time. Leaves you hanging and excited for the next film in the series. My guess is there will be 3
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Will watch any movie with Bruce Willis, and it was action pacted but didn't care for the ending. I was stuck with a &#34;WHAT&#34; at the end...didn't feel it was finished.
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Another great read by Kate Morton.  She is a True talent, her story telling is a treat and feast for the mind.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Wasn't a good story line....thought there would be more of a story line. The movie previews were the best part of the movie.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|I read this for a class. It was dull, the characters were annoying, and the writing just lifeless. I'm done with this author.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|Just love Bruce Willis...would watch any movie he was in. Great action picture show...would watch it again. Thank you for a great movie.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|My wife has read all of these books and was so excited to see the movie.  She enjoyed it a lot but said that some things were not correct according to the book.  I didn't read the book because I leave fictional stories for movies, and I really liked it.  I usually do not like strong female leads because I feel they are either annoying or overly bossy.  I actually think most movies with strong female leads just try and go overboard with the role.  This one seemed perfect.  She seemed logical (for the most part) and very believable.  The story itself is very interesting as I like post-apocalyptic type settings.  The special effects are pretty good and not too over done.  The fire suit they wear looks good and not cheesy.  Overall I thought the movie was very good.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This isn't Tolstoy....this is modern pulp and I had FUN reading it.<br /><br />-Quick action<br />-decent character development<br />-novel storyline<br /><br />If you're in the mood for an easy to read fun story, you can't go wrong with a tale starring Jack Reacher.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I watched this show from the beginning and loved it.  After the writer's strike it really started to get a little weird.  I felt they wrapped it up too quickly in this season but I still think it was good.  The blu-rays for LOST always look great.  The picture is very clear and the scenes on the island look amazing.  This is a great addition to any LOST fan's collection.
B000JML7EC|5.0|who doesn't love pirates and buried treasure and adventure on the high seas?  IRS agents and life-insurance salesmen, that's who.  everyone else can enjoy this awesome classic time and again.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I loved this movie.  I originally saw it in imax 3d and thought it was great.  They do not over do it with the 3D stuff.  It is appropriate not just an in-your-face-axe type deal.  Jeff Bridges does a great job and the story line is continued from the first movie which I really liked.  They didn't just make something new up.  The special effects were great and if you watch the first one again you can really see how far we have come with that type of technology.  All in all the movie is great and the blu-ray is great especially if you happen to have a 3D tv to take advantage of the 3D blu-ray this comes with.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|The film doesn't do this book justice.  But after reading the book, I did appreciate the film a little more.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|This is the first part to the last events in the Harry Potter series.  if you watch this do not forget to watch part 2!  I enjoyed this movie as I have all the Harry potter movies.  This is a great series for children and adults alike.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Bought this for my Alaska-resident brother who works for Denali National Park.  He absolutely flipped over how sweet this thing is, and durable.  Well balanced too.  Great size for getting stuff done without too much bulk to carry around.  Sheath stuck a bit at first until we realized you had to press on a specific tabbed area to widen it for release.
B004T4KKSA|4.0|I work in the oil and gas industry as an engineer and have really enjoyed this book and the information it has provided.  It gives a chronicling of oil and gas and how it has helped shape the world into what it is now.  The book seems unbiased and provides a lot of interesting details and facts I didn't know.  To be honest I have yet to finish this book, while I find it very interesting this is a really big book.  I love facts and information and history as much as the next engineer but some points in this book seem to drag and it isn't so much the fault of the author it is just how it actually happened and I appreciate the commitment to the details.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in how the world has come about using oil and gas and the rich history behind it all.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Say what you will.  Lost is a great series, and the ending is wonderful.  You have to start from the very beginning of the series to appreciate all the character development and relationships that go into making the ending what it is.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great set since it has all the discs in one box.  The 3D looked great as well as the blu-ray.  I was able to let my brother in law borrow the dvd version without losing the ability to watch it myself.  The digital copy is great too since I use iTunes often.  Overall the movie itself was very action packed with a ton of &#34;one-liners&#34; that are cool.  I was a bit disappointed they didn't use Edward Norton for the Hulk but this guy seemed to do pretty well.  If you liked any of the other Marvel movies you will surely enjoy this one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author put some pretty unbelievable things in here.  Who knows if that's what heaven is really like.  But if it is we're in for a heck of a journey.  Too many remarkable occurances for this guy not to have experienced a true miracle.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|We have all the harry potter's on blu ray and this completed the collection.  This is probably my favorite one as it is much darker and has more action.  This is part 2 mind you so make sure you watch part 1 first.  The whole series is fun and entertaining.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Great visuals of the actual locations where these events took place.  Call me crazy, but this movie inspired me to learn how to surf.  I tried once on a short board one day when I was 16, and never gave it another thought.  This movie changed my mind somehow.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a psychological thriller but in a different way.  It makes you actually think and I like that in a movie.  The special effects in the movie are great and look amazing on blu-ray.  I recommend this movie to anyone.
1878424114|4.0|This is a great read. I would even give as a gift. Just the title alone is enough. My mother purchased a copy before I could pass it along.
B0092MKFIY|2.0|If you like &#34;Radioactive,&#34; you might not like the rest of the album.  The songs have very inconsistent sounds.  The album seems to be missing cohesiveness.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent read. I was happy with the way the book ended. Bitter sweet. Loved this trilogy. Definetly recommending it to everyone
B009A3NGF4|4.0|You'll either like it or you won't--there's probably not much in between.  The album has a consistent sound, so if you enjoy the songs you know them for, then you'll really enjoy the entire album.  There are some unexpectedly good songs on here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!!!!! Its betterthan temple run cause its alot more chalenging!!!!!!!! Get it and you will be hooked cause its soooooo much fun lol
B007M45PMU|4.0|I bought this album because I liked their song, &#34;Ho Hey.&#34;  It took a couple listens to grow on me, but I've really come to enjoy the songs, especially &#34;Slow it Down.&#34;  The raw sound of these songs invokes a lot of emotion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app with many resources such as many maps and videos of forecasts. It also has a great radar! It's way better than the weather channel app. Totally worth it.
0723257639|5.0|These books are so lovely! Even the case is beautiful. Over the last few years, I have given this set as a baby shower gift and a birthday gift. I finally bought a set for myself. I have several books about Beatrix Potter, and these books are a lovely addition to my collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game it's awesome how you can train, feed and pet the horses...my two year old enjoys it also! Two thumbs up!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What ever you do bro buy it all u have to do is spend is $0 yeah I said it it costs $0 for such a great game
B005HHSXP0|5.0|while I adore Percy Jackson books it was a little bit annoying how it was only camp jupiter instead. Other than that it was a great book. Riordan as inpired me to do more with my life. So a few weeks ago, I started writing a book at 9 yrs of age. Riordan has wormed his way to the top of my charts. you will not regret purchasing this item. Recommended for ages 8-any age!! ;D
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It would be difficult to match the buzz for this book and it was. It did reach a  working level of authentic compelling reading.<br />IT is an easy villain because to quote Arthur C. Clark &#34;..any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&#34;<br />It was preferable to another damn elf, though.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|It will make your heart break.<br />It will make your heart soar.<br />Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one.
0385495323|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lots of great history told in a very interesting way. I gave it as a gift to some of my friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had heard about the book and knew it had a legion of fans.  It was well worth the read, and while not flawless it was everything I look for in a book - exciting, challenging and very thoughtful at the same time.  I'm hesitant to move on to the sequels since I enjoyed the ending of this so much, and since they have a big act to follow.  I'll probably do it anyway, though.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I have adored this show for a very long time, and the movie really did it justice. Is it live theatre? No. But I was very pleased with everything this film had to offer.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A story of extreme resourcefulness in the face of impossible adversity.  The realm of the Spirit is vaster than any sea, and much deeper.  A great read.
1426308469|5.0|I am a parent of a child who loves dinosaurs. This book comes highly recommended. There are 52 different dinosaurs presented in the book, characterized by size; small, medium, large, and super. Each dinosaur comes with a full page color illustration, a brief description, and a small information chart showing its size, eating habits, and the time period in which it lived.<br /><br />This book was clearly designed for younger kids, because it has large print, pronunciation guides for all the dinosaur names, and imagination style questions associated with each dinosaur, like \\"if you could have a pet dinosaur, what would you name it?\\" for the micropachycephalosaurus. But children pick up the names very quickly, and soon you will find that they can remember the names of all the dinosaurs in the book just by looking at the picture.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the list of activities at the very end to continue your experience once you have finished looking over the book. The book has several suggestions that could be applied to varying ages and skill levels, from playing predator-prey, a hide and seek style game where you pretend to be dinosaurs, to the alphabet game, where you list each letter of the alphabet and try to find a dinosaur name to go with each one.<br /><br />If you are looking for a dinosaur book for older kids, there is also the \\"National Geographic Kids First Book of Big Dinosaurs\\", not to be confused with this book for \\"Little\\" kids. In that book, they use a similar format, but have many more dinos and a lot more general information about dinosaur habits, but no activities page.
B005VPRG10|5.0|This is the first LEGO set I have purchased and assembled in a good many years. So, I decided that with some extra income I should take the dive and finally put one together. I chose the TIE Fighter because it seemed fairly priced for what the set contained and I'm a bit of a sucker for the fighter itself (I'd prefer it be a TIE Interceptor, but I won't be picky).<br /><br />The instruction booklet was easy to read, contained large, helpful illustrations, and was just plain nicely put together. I seem to remember booklets being a lot more vague and smaller back in the day. The pieces themselves were all there (In fact, I had a few extra small bits) and fit together exactly as intended.<br /><br />I think this probably took me somewhere around an hour and a half, perhaps two hours to build, and that was without any particular focus being put into it since I wanted to savor the build. The end result is a good size and displays very nicely. I personally like to pretend it is sitting in the hanger being serviced by the pilot and astromech while the guard guards and the officer supervises.<br /><br />Overall, it was a spectacular bit of fun and I'd recommend the set to others.
B00005JMYI|5.0|i really thought this was a funny movie. Loved the street fight scene and the cast works together well. thanks
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If your into the zombie genre this a great \\"what if\\" book. Would we be like the characters in this book, or would we just lie down and accept extinction. Great read! Hard to put down.
B000TEPL92|5.0|This man has a God-given talent and knows how to use it to make me one happy lady tonight and tomorrow!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Calculator plus is a pretty good app. Its not your scientific calculater but I haven't found anything wrong with it other than the fact that you cant use the &quot;tutorial&quot; again after you've used it the first time. When I first got it, I was sorta rushed and didn't pay much attention to the instructions and later tried to look at them, but if theres a way to do that I haven't found it
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|I had no high expectations for a new Suede album (the last one, \\"A New Morning\\", left much to be desired).<br /><br />Bringing back Ed Buller to produce \\"Bloodsports\\" has proven to be a wise decision. Every song on the album harkens back to Suede at their best in the 90's. The arrangements, production, mixing, and performance are equal to that time in the band's history. I was shocked to hear just how great it flows together, but it's true: this is my most favorite album by them since their debut 20 years ago. Much praise is due to Brett and everyone else in the band. They've made a truly spectacular comeback. I cannot wait to hear more from them in the future.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of shedding light on the impact of culture and circumstance in determining an individual's success.  While I found the book very eye opening, I am left with the question \\"And so?\\"  I am interested in more of the author's conclusions from his work, the ideas that he has for improving our society to expand high achievement.  He does offer some ideas here, but I find myself wanting more.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|At times, the book feels intensely personal; other times like a well researched mini-thesis.  And therein for me is its strength.  Different parts of this book will resonate at different times for me, I suspect.  It is one I will read again.  The criticism she received--&#34;she can't possibly speak to these issues as she has money and privilege&#34;---from some pundits infuriates me.  Guess that means we shouldn't read or listen to Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, or Jack Welch!  I have now bought copies to give to my 20-something daughters, as well as some professional female millenials.  A thought provoking read.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I kept thinking I was going to put this book down, and not finish it. But something kept drawing me back. I'm so glad I didn't give up on Ms McKenna! She didn't give up on her characters, and I was rewarded with a treasure of a story that will stay with me for some time.
B006QF61VA|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was great then.  Watching it this many years later I was surprised at how much more I like it now.  It's a view into life in the military that is actually pretty right on target with reality.  We were in the military when it was released and although the movie is set in Vietnam time the protocol and daily life of the military person was really the same as it was in the 80's.  It shows how ridiculous some of the policies and practices were, yet also shows that the real military person as an actual person, fighting because it's his/her job, not always liking what that means, putting up with monotony and pure terror sometimes in the same 10 minutes, and finally just in how they relate to the world.  Robin Williams was at the top of his game when this came out and does a fantastic job of showing how important humor is to really tough situations.  Both my teenage boys put down their phones and actually watched the movie because oh his humor rants and skits, and because of the way the movie put the story together.  That says a lot!  They loved it as much as I did.
0307719219|5.0|A must-read. I was taken aback by the ambition of this book. The authors sought (no less) than to explain political and economic success since the Middle Ages, all across the globe. And contrary to what one might have expected, yes, they do succeed at it. Having to condense so much history in a digestible format, at times they engage in slight oversimplifications when they describe specific events, but they cannot really be blamed for that. What they have accomplished is really remarkable. This is one of the most influential books I have ever read, probably in the same category than The End of History, by F. Fukuyama, or the Clash of Civilizations, by S. Huntington.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The story is, ordinarily, gripping, but that has more to do with the characters than the plot.  A plot driven enthusiast will be disappointed.  In my opinion the characters, fleshed out well, make up for any other defects.
B0071AKB38|4.0|I received this yesterday and was honestly amazed by the build quality and the specs, and it works in blue tooth mode perfectly. But the only problem I noticed was that when in Bluetooth mode the sound output dropped quiet a bit so I'm not to happy with that. But for this company first try with the Bluetooth I think they did pretty good. And I would hold off from buying this, to get there next Bluetooth speaker which they are very likely to make, To fix the buetooth mode sound drop problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so much more fun than temple run its better than anyother game out there its amazing you guys did a great job
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This one is just not as good as the first three. I'm hooked on some of the characters in this series, but Book Four has too many new characters without following up on some of the ones I already know. I don't like not knowing what happens to Brienne, for example, as the noose tightens around her neck. Of course I will have to buy the 1000-plus-page Book Five to meet Tyrion or Bran again, but it's discouraging to realize there will NEVER be closure as Martin will keep cranking them out to feed the TV series.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tenant is a great Doctor, and while I did not enjoy his companion as much her grandfather more than made up for it
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I really liked this, I thought the characters were excellent. I really like how it showed how Mutants stepped up to the plate to help the government, it has good plot twists.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I haven't bought a CD of a &#34;new&#34; group since I was a kid. I'm now 60 and I really like this group.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|this game is very fun, it does work, its worth 1 dollar, and its very good. the app works well, I'm serious, the people that say this game doesn't work or it wont load are either lying or haven't even played it yet. here's a tip when your in old Japan looking for the books, on the Waldo watcher one I only found it by tapping random spots. this game is fun. trust me I'm telling the truth, I know some people just don't want to admit it but this game is fun.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|I just watched this movie and had to come and write a review. I can't belive what a heartwarming movie this is. Oscar (the baby chimp), is the cutest thing I've ever seen--I actually want to adopt him. What began with me laughing at him, turned into me becoming very upset, and then happy again. Luckily, Oscar finds with way, with a little help from a friend. I am so happy that the movie ended on a postive note and not a downer. I've never went through so many emotions within one movie. I have no idea how the film makers captured this remarkable journey--Bravo to them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Dean Holder always knows what to say to make a girl swoon. I couldn't put this book down at all. College Hoover is a brilliant writer!
0452285186|5.0|It is too bad that people intelligent enough to invent so many way of committing suicide only have one chance to rehearse themselves.<br />Poor bunny, you only live many times
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I went into the app store today and I saw angry birds star wars for free so I clicked and it told me it's incompatible for the kindle but it works for my phone what the heck!!!
B000V9D5LG|5.0|I received my lens just before I left for Alaska last July. It takes amazing pictures and even stands up to being knocked off a TV stand and dropping to the floor about 3.5-4ft while attached to camera. very durable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was not going to read it, but I am hooked. Loved it so much I bought the whole set.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Been a killswitch fan for years and this is by far the best album i've ever heard. Welcome back Jesse!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not going to read it, but I am hooked. Loved it so much I bought the whole set.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Yet again Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers have created another great album. This one is a must have for any fan.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think I am addicted to pinterest. I downloaded this to my tablet and use it at lunch at work and then at night when I am watching tv. It is a great app
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very different and I liked the chance to get in the main characters head to understand his illness. The family dynamics was interesting but sad with the fathers relationship with the Mother & Son.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Warning...unless you've got a lot of free time...beware.  This is addictive!  Ive gotten lots of great ideas from this site
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Next book ........... hurry please..... such great excitement in this book, such infatuation. Wonderful fantasy, hard to believe life can be so dim at times.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Just can't get into this book.  I still have not finished reading it.  Just not exciting enough for me.  I need more action/ adventure
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I had a wipes case but it always dried out my wipes.  This is perfect because it keeps the wipes moist and you can attach it to the stroller or outside of a diaper bag easily.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I carry in this backpack: 3 flashes + 3 or 4 kind of flash diffusers + 1 camera body +  1 spare camera battery + 3 lenses (18-55mm, 35mm and 55-300mm) + 3 radio trigger units + 2 hot umbrella and flash holders + 8AA rechargeable batteries... I think that's it.<br />It is very well padded but it is smaller than I thought. However, it is very good designed and of course it will be up to you to figure out how you like to set up the pads which is a nice detail.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book really doesnt want you to put it down.  Keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next til the end.
B007JMW46U|4.0|Such ego and what a mind, Sherlock can and does solve a series of mysteries with Dr. Watson in tow. Easy reading short stories, set together.
B007HO392S|5.0|You can connect with alot of her songs as far as feelings. She is very good at what she does.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like that it is a 20 min. workout that I can do first thing in the morning before getting my 13 and 8 year old up and ready for school.  I like the 3-2-1 set-up and I feel like I'm getting a great workout!!  I also like that there are three levels.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|It came way before the due date. I was surprised. They are on it. Wonderful company to work with when ordering things.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book goes beyond just being beautifully written. It grabs onto your heart and will not let go, not even in the epilogue. Strong, believable, and lovable characters and a plot that keeps you guessing and even talking aloud. I found myself cursing at Robert at least twice and Minnie too. There was even a point where I yelled at Ms. Milan, wondering if she  was intentionally trying to break my heart! However, she redeemed herself beautifully!<br /><br />I believe I will label this as my most favorite book of the year thus far. Ms Milan has outdone herself with The Duchess War. I look forward to reading the next book in this series.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I can't get anything to appear when I type words into the notepad. Was playing the tutorial and couldn't even get the word ladder to appear. Will update my review when the app is working properly...
1579128955|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it.<br />I recommend this book for all ages.
0670026557|5.0|I'd heard a lot about Adam Grant before reading this book, and honestly, I was worried it was going to be overhyped. We've all heard that it's good to be a good person, and that more people should do good things, yadda yadda. What could this book possibly tell me that I haven't heard a million times before?<br /><br />I could not have been more wrong. At every turn, Dr. Grant provides fun and interesting stories and anecdotes (the type you'll hear people talking about at parties or the water cooler) right next to compelling research and rigorous data (the type you'll hear people talking about in boardrooms or across the conference table). Soft skills backed by hard science-- FINALLY! This ain't your typical self-improvement book-- this is the real deal.<br /><br />I've always been afraid of acting like a giver because I didn't want to be seen as weak or get taken advantage of, but I truly feel armed with the new knowledge I got from this book (like how to spot a taker and protect yourself from them, and how to avoid burning out). I hope I don't sound like a taker when I say that I hope other people read this book because of a slightly selfish reason: I want more people to talk about it with :)<br /><br />This is actually my first review because I've never liked a book enough to review it, so I don't know how to end it. I guess I'll just say that this is a book I wish I'd read a long time ago, and now that I have, I'm not going to waste another second without putting into practice what I've learned. It's too important not to. So if you're looking for a book that will get you fired up, educate you, and make you look at the world in a different (and delightful) way, then you have come to the right place. Enjoy!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved it. Glad amazon was offering it free on instant streaming otherwise I would have missed out! I liked season two better - but even still each episode could be a 4-5 star movie on its own. Can't wait for season three and hopefully more seasons after that!
B004GYY714|5.0|There are places that don't have any radio reception. Other places offer only insanely awful programming. Now I can pick what I want to listen to and not be at the mercy of some backward thinking program directors. Tunein does what it's supposed to do - correctly -  first time every time. The only drawback is not all radio stations are available. But that's probably because some stupid contractual reasons. If you like radio get this ap.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I just really like the music on this album.  I start at track 1 and listen till the end.  In my opinion there are not a lot of albums that you can do that with.  This is one of them.
B005HSL626|5.0|my son introduced this to me and it is fun and simple to play.  very addictive and super fun, fun,fun.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very fun and relaxing to watch. I enjoyed the everydayness of it. I live in a very small community, so I understood a lot I'm  sure some wouldn't.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it's a very useful tool to have.  I'm happy to have it.  It's nice to know what the weather is gonna be before you step out the door
B0045HCJG2|5.0|you forgot to say the magic word &#34;what the magic word?&#34; pleeeeeeease??? a murder every 1:48 seconds, a pisser every damn second
B002VECM72|5.0|2013-04-11
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|so interesting and also easy to play. attractive game. good graphic, easy to control. works perfect on HTC Sensation 4G.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show excellent series. Tis is an excellent gift this show should have been kept on the air. Can't wait for Castle to be over.
B000FA675C|2.0|While I acknowledge the fact that this is a work of fiction, the uninitiated might receive the misimpression that some of the so-called &#34;factual&#34; aspects of the book are facts. One example will suffice. Brown misrepresents content of the Dead Sea Scrolls as having anything to do with early Christianity. In fact, most of the scrolls were written before the appearance of the Jesus movement and there is absolutely no mention of anything Christian in the Scrolls.<br /><br />Anyone who has any kind of background in theology, history and symbolism, will not be particularly thrilled with this book, I imagine.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|It's JT so you know. It's pretty good. Only 2 faves, would be nice to have more hits from him. Songs are long which is prob how he can get away with only 10 tracks.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have this downloaded on my Kindle Fire and it works well.  A calculator is always a very handy thing to have around.  The screen is sufficiently large and the calculator is capable of doing more complex work but I use it for the simple stuff.  No regrets.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I was blown away by this album. This album was heavy and intense and emotional. Excellent songs throughout the album, the stand outs to me were \\"Peckingpah, Do Me A Favor\\". This album is a great conclusion.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The film is highly enjoyable and even though I have only utilized the DVD edition, the quality is  excellent.  I enjoy watching the behind the scenes and the movie is a great fit with the extended version Lord of the Rings trilogy that I own.  I look forward to The Desolation of Smaug.
B009EAO38C|4.0|... into new age, elevator musak that puts you to sleep all to quickly ... which you don't want, especially when you're driving.<br /><br />I'm sure that the more I listen to this CD, the more I'll find that I like .. but what stands out the most after the first listen is the fun interplay between the piano and the cello.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys .... love the YouTube videos too ... especially the one where all the guys play the same piano .... I think the song featured there is the last one on the CD ... What Makes You Beautiful.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun addicting gameplay. Really enjoy the goal based milestones. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a SimCity style game without the tedious financial aspect
B0089M0DGM|5.0|Wow!! These mofos really kick out the jams. This is actually two concerts and and about four hours of nonstop hard rocking funk. They are a first rate show band and don't hold anything back. The video quality is very good for the time period, but the Rockpalast folks always do an excellent job. The sound quality is very good as well. I recommend this very highly.
B001EL6EHC|5.0|the movie perfect as always the souvenirs are very nice so far the pictures and all the extra stuff, nothing to complain.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|The album is nothing short of awesome! It's been on repeat for weeks now and it's probably my favorite album after Infest. &#34;Give Me Back My Life&#34; is in my opinion the best track and the whole album is really enjoyable!
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|Quality of the video was good, The movie locked up on the twice in the first 30 minutes, making me reload the Amazon video app.
B00B1CGD5M|4.0|As advertised Soilwork always delivers quality music. Although it's still hard to beat some of their older albums this new blend is great to enjoy!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Contains all Harry Potter movies in simple thick blu ray cases. Must have for any movie lover and MUST HAVE for the HP fans! The most cheep and especially best way to obtain all movies.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I loved the plot and the way it was made as a film. I liked the act of the actors. So five stars to BBC.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The really did an amazing job with the restoration. Any movie lover and Star Wars fan must have this in your collection. In addition, it is a smart trilogy to buy if you are thinking about the future Star Wars movies coming out.
0670026182|5.0|Tried few of the recipes already and loved them. The book is sitting on my coffee table because It is so nice to look at, a real piece of art.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for any movie lover and especially Batman fans! This is the perfect trilogy to get if you only want the blu ray versions of the Dark Knight trilogy. In addition, the actual box that contains the movies is great! nothing fancy but definitively. amazing.
0307743659|5.0|Stephen King at his best! Scary, atmospheric and a classic! The movie didn't do it justice. Can't wait for the next one.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The blu ray brings out the best to these movies. If your a true fan of Star Wars, you will want this trilogy. It's a must have if you want these Star Wars movies on blu ray and are a smart addition if you're thinking about the new Star Wars movies.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Let's see where to begin, although I appreciated going day by day to get the sense of what was happening it dragged on for me a bit made it slow. I almost felt like I was living as Cathy a bit with all of the checking and counting which is good because it brought the character to life. I feel like all that she went through and those that betrayed her we deserved to see some kind of acknowledgement of them being in the wrong and apologizing to Cathy. Overall this was a great book just takes a while to lead up to something is all
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Everything about this set is perfect!!! the box set itself is beautiful! Every movie has its own slot full of pictures and it is amazing. When it comes to the movies itself, the restoration is unbelievable! Must have for any movie lover!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I really like White Noise.  There are a lot of great sounds, both preinstalled and downloadable from the web via the link inside the app.  I really love the timer feature that allows you to stop playing or exit the app after a certain amount of time has elapsed.  I usually put a sound on to play for 2-3 hours and fall asleep to it.<br /><br />My only issues came from trying to use the app as an alarm.  It does not seem to play nice with my lock screen and pin setup on Android.  It was hit or miss as to whether or not the alarm sounded.  Additionally, the app itself could interfere with my native Android alarm. I have to set the app to exit before morning.<br /><br />I would love to be able to use this as an alarm, as the gentle wakeup provided would be preferable.  This is the only thing that kept me from rating White Noise as five stars.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is just another awsome installment to George Martins great series. Can't wait for The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Well thought out story line with just enough humor mixed in with the drama to keep the story lite and entertaining. I love science fiction and this was just suttle enough to keep to close to real.
B002DMJL9E|5.0|Buddy movies ever made! Funny, sharp, suspenseful. Nolte is classic and never better in my opinion. Eddie singing Sting?!<br /><br />Roxanne!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is one of the funniest people I've ever seen on television, and her humor is apparent in &#34;Bossypants.&#34; Read this book!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Well told, well acted, singing, yes singing, some very good, some, well they sang. Very moving and the acting gave the story depth and made it more recognizable to a current audience.
B001AQO446|5.0|This is a Great classic movie with lots of laughs and its worth watching many times over! It is one of my favorites.
B008220D7S|3.0|The movie itself is at best a yawner with a couple of funnys sprinkeled in among the pathetic plot and the holes in the script are just too big for the actors to fill. I watch the trailers and laughed til I cried and had to have this movie! Big mistake...rent it, Red Box it or On Demand it, do not under any circumstances make the same mistake I did and buy it. Not worth the purchase price....not worh the cost of shipping and handling....love the actors though.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|This is just an okay movie and hard to listen to some of the voices of the characters.  This is a watch it once movie and on to something better.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|The actors, the music, the genre, the 80's. What a great back drop to the beginning of some fine careers in show biz. \\"Winning!\\"
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is great for parents and kids alike.  Super cute, funny, and enjoyable.  Will be a family favorite for years to come.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed this teen sci-fi and I can't wait to see the movie! Quick read and easy to follow! HAPPY READING
B0063IH60K|3.0|Do not like the pop up ads between games.  Everything else is ok.  I would have paid a little bit and avoided the pop ups.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I appreciate that the movie had close captioning.  I did not appreciate the disrespectful attitude of one of the characters.  The Glitch was a turn off, but I still enjoyed the movie.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Pros: Great pacing, character development, and excellent story.<br /><br />Cons: It made me cry.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this film to anyone who remembers the arcade era in this country and has children. My nieces all enjoyed it without needing to understand all of the character and game references, and I enjoyed it as well because I did grasp all of them. Cleverly written and with a surprisingly effective voice cast, I cannot imagine who wouldn't love this family film.
B00755646W|5.0|Great item. Thanks for selling this CD on you website. Will be back to purchase more movie concerts from you again. A+++++++++
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was awesome as Lincoln. Great story and well protrayed by all. Sally Field was amazing. The entire cast was truly inspiring and captivating.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|its a nice album for any romantic dinner.i did use it to play on my wedding party and everybody loves it :)
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Ok. Somewhat entertaining. Story line predictable. What was entertaning was the twist and turns but not much more than that.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved this book , as he was a true American hero, being a retired navy man myself and at one time was involved with seal training, so have a good ideal what these warriors go through.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I've been a fan ever since the movie was first shown in cinemas and with blu ray technology, the movie seems to look so ever new even after all these years. A cult status classic that all Brandon Lee fans will cherish. Until the next remastering to 4K (if there is ever one) this is the version you should own.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is a spectacular game it is fun and creative and addicting.  Whoever wants to get a good game out there, get Minecraft, the game every body loves and plays all day!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. It has everything a great book should have. Great characters, great story, a hot man and a tumultuous romance. Loved it!
B00933JL0A|5.0|This is a great game! There is nothing boring about this game. I love how it gives you a large selection of buildings. Like I said, this is a great time killer!
B009XL5NVS|5.0|Having discovered Steve Lukather this past January after a FB friend posted a pic of himself and Steve at the NAMM show in Los Angeles, and inquiring about him....I came to finding out about so much great music I've been ignorant about for the past 20 years.  I had loved ToTo back in the day, then got too busy with College, and teaching...would often wonder what ever became of them...and WOW! I've been so blessed to discover so many gems from not only ToTo, but from Steve Lukather!!<br /><br />Been listening to his new CD \\"Transition\\" with my earphones, and as a musician I can truly say that the fullness and variety of melody and harmonies is very rich, and Steve's voice is sooo Charming as is his guitar playing...understatement!! I know, and everyone knows he's the Master.<br /><br />Although some of the songs from this CD make you \\"think\\" and ponder society's ills...The one song that I personally find the most beautiful..and the most beautiful of all Love Songs I've ever heard, is \\"Rest of The World\\", written by Jack Raines and CJ Vanston. I've tried finding out more about Jack Raines, and I read that he does backup vocals on the CD, but I can't find anything else about his having ever written any music before. I find that song to be the most luring and appealing song out of the whole album, and I hope that Jack Raines and CJ Vanston get a lot of credit for that song eventually.<br /><br />Love the album..you must get it!!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|If I ever get rich, I am going to hire Deftones to play at my birthday party in Colorado! Yes sir..
B00008G7UF|5.0|This is a chick flick that a guy can enjoy as well.  Kevin Kline makes you think he is native French.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|this is a great movie. sam neil shined in the role. it is a must see for the whole family. LOVED IT
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love this album - the songs are great, I listen to it all the time on my ride to work.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Not my type of movie so my review should reflect this. Didn't like the plot and I would have liked a better ending.
B001XUNOSQ|5.0|Watched this movie with our 7 year old Grandson, we all loved the happy feelings in this movie.<br />Highly recommended!
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show reminds me a little of the kind of humor that was in Malcolm in the Middle. Ridiculous, at times sweet, and overall very funny.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I am a huge Mitch Albom fan.  I like how the books are short but have a lot of content.  This book was no exception...great story filled with mythology and spirituality...can't wait for his next book as I have read all of the others!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Alfie Boe is magnificent as is the rest of the cast.  My husband and I were mesmerized from beginning to end,  We've seen Le Mis<br />many times on Broadway so we love the score.  This is the best investment for many wonderful nights of entertainment.  The music will reach down into your soul.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book was chosen for a book club read.  I enjoyed the strong visuals the writer created, although it had a very predictable story line.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is a Davinci Code for book lovers. I didn't know exactly what I was getting into, but it was an enjoyable read.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Hard to keep interested. It says I need 16 more words. Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring boring boring, boring boring.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read all the beautiful series back to back, and as in anything I enjoy hated to see them end..
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is a fan-tabulous musical... A great classic!! In Bu-ray widescreen it is great!! The extras were fun to see also.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I am a guy's guy, so I was a little wary when dragged to see this--fearing girly storylines and glee-like music (I can't stand glee.) some of the music and mashups were reminiscent of glee, but way better--more creative, catchy, and of course all instrumentatation was done by people (their mouths, to be specific.) the songs ranged from the '80s till now. the actresses were very good as well: anna camp from true blood, rebel wilson from bridesmaids, brittany snow from various movies and some tv shows. and anna kendrick from lots of movies in recent years, among others. and they all did their own singing. oh, and michael higgins and elizabeth banks are the announcers at the various singing competitions, and they are hilarious together!<br /><br />the disc has extras out the wazoo (rare for DVDs these days), and the BD adds a few more extras, extra line-o-ramas, etc, and of course better picture/sound. the best feature hands down (imho) is the music video for starships (only on the discs--not shown in theatres.) it features all the mains singing/instrumentizing + a bunch of videos of people singing into their cameras at home that they sent in (youtube-style) so the filmmakers could edit them all together to complete the whole song. way cool, super catchy!<br /><br />all in all, a very enjoyable film (even for guys, and people who despise glee), and the semi-big names really help make this move shine, as well as the rest of the ensemble.  I gave 4 stars, as it is fairly hard to get 5 out of me, unless it's in 'silver linings playbook' territory...<br />one other note: if you get the CD, get the deluxe version as it contains more songs that were trimmed from the movie (probably for time/pace.)
B008SGMPVU|5.0|Any true hardcore sf fan must have this old classic - a true watershed of future sf.  Plus it's funny as hell!
1577314808|5.0|I have read and reread this work countless times and gained amazing insight and found practical useful principles for daily life. Having recommended this to many family members their responses are mixed, some love it others found nothing of value. I guess it depends on where you are personally.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine since I was little. I think it's a wonderful story and I enjoy reading it over and over again.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book is about a woman trying to escape a seriously abusive relationship and all the panic that it causes her.  it kept me interested and wanting to know what would happen next
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I look at this movie with my grand daughter. She loves the movie so do I. When she start getting fussy, I get the kindle, turn it on for her,and we watch it together, she want's me to be right there with her. We are creating memories. Dona Riley<br />Arthur of (Steal this Step By Step System To make money than I'll ever make)
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Was the best movie I've seen in quite some time. It's a jaw dropping hilarious comedy that I would recommend everyone to watch.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|This is a great movie, looks awesome on my Vizio 47 inch hdtv, Blu ray is a crisp and clean picture and fast shipping too.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|My review is NOT a comment on the album, but on what is being sold.  The standard edition of this album is offered with AutoRip, as is the Vinyl Deluxe Edition.  Why is AutoRip not available with the Deluxe Edition CD?  Will change my review when I get a satisfactory answer!
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I thought it was a well written book. The story idea was very creative the only thing I though though was that it was really boring there was nothing that really go me excited and made me want to read the book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app for work to store all my notes and instructions for customers. I can easily share notebooks with clients.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome, I really love this game!<br />It's highly addictive and fun, it's kind of a cross between the original temple run and temple run brave.<br />The monkey makes bear sounds :)<br /><br />The graphics are awesome and I like the new obstacles, though I have come across a few bugs.<br /><br />For all those concerned about having to buy gems, don't worry you can collect them in runs.<br />Overall I love this game, you should get it, I don't think it's going to be free forever.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Been looking for her great songs especially the duets and I found it. Great album at a very cheap price!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love the game except that this lady in the game tells me to put up a decoration that I have already put up.Then once I do what she wants I get stuck in this place and the only 2 ways to get out is to go home or shut off kindle.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|It sucked, gone in less than a day.  I have nothing else I can say about it other than do not waste your time.
0385344228|2.0|I won't spoil it but a couple of plot moves at the end I didn't buy.  Also got to know dad. Bit but all other characters were poorly developed.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|I have spoken with 3 of my physicians and none of them have recommended I use this diet<br />I'd love my money back
B000FA675C|5.0|A truly exciting book.  I couldn't put it down until I got to the last page.  Cant wait for the next
B000VNMMPM|5.0|when bought it i thought it would be a boring one , well turned up to be a good movie after all ... french always realistic with their movies
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie.  The story, the acting, and the action.  Special kudos goes to the acting, unbelievably excellent in every regard.  No weak points here.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Great app but I wish the &quot;Enter&quot; key was the default key instead the smiley faces. I hate to long press every time I need to start a new line
0062082353|5.0|A point of view never encountered before, and clearly open frank and brutally honest. In the military or not, every thoughtful person should read this book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|boring and it totally sucks do not get it at all or you would never play it do not get
1401232590|5.0|This is a very compelling and wonderful dark Batman tale. The art by Tim Sale is amazingly so well done you find yourself actually slowing down your reading pace to drink the art in. I found this to actually a 2 part story, the second half being the sequel, \\" Batman: Dark Victory \\". Even with all the many characters within these 2 tales, you never find yourself lost thanks to Jeph Loeb's fine story telling. The only downside which I found ongoing throughout the story was the many references to \\" The Godfather \\" . It seems like parts of dialogue and certain situations were taken directly or indirectly from the film, but even subtly Loeb and Sale make it work for them. Over all , still a great story I know I will read again in the future.
B00B23O96A|3.0|The High Standards of his past work are tough to maintain , so I guess it is time to no expect as much  . . .
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|I'm not gonna write a really long review or anything. I mainly just wanna give this thing 5 stars to boost the rating from its current 4. I've been a KV fan since Childish Prodigy and have picked up everything the man has put out. It's all great stuff, but this one somehow manages to best them all. Don't let the long track times fool you, they all float by in a breeze and sometimes the whole thing almost seems too short. I know J Mascis is an influence on Kurt and you can really hear it in some of these songs. I was kinda bummed that Smoke Ring didn't have any heavy rockers, and neither does this one but it doesn't need 'em. In fact they'd probably break up the flow. I can't remember the last time I had a record in such constant rotation... yes I can, the last GBV album. Pretty sure I heard him name drop Moon Duo at some point and there's a song called Air Bud. What more do you need?
B0086449YA|4.0|Some wonderful lyrics and as always some wonderful guitar lyrics , no disappointments as always Mark delivers . . .
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel. Historical fiction. Good characters and good story. I've ordered the other two in series and can't wait!
B002ELM5HY|4.0|Although it is no Brothers in Arms , it was a nice listen with his recognisable sounds . . .
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie more then I did the 3 Lord of the Rings movies, I hope the next two chapters coming up of the Hobbit, are just as good.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris you will be missed but your name will carry on and give hope to those that follow in your footsteps.  AATW my brother.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A very well made movie, Ben Afflect did a great job.  Why not 5 stars, I guess it is because I already knew the out come of this event in history.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and a breeze to download to my kindle large numbers and functions are easy and standard which works great for me
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really use this app alot.  I got &#34;hooked&#34; in Pinterest and it is hard to put it down and do something else.  So many good ideas!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Read all of the books maybe a year ago. Thoroughly enjoyed them. You're always concerned about books being adapted to a movie.<br /><br />I thought that the movie captured the spirit of the book. Characters were true to the book although they could have gotten either very cheesy, or the movie could have turned into an action only movie.<br /><br />Superb movie for the Kindle Fire HD. Quality was excellent!<br /><br />One side comment. Actually watched the movie in three segments. Don't know how I would have felt watching 2-1/2 hours in a theater, although I'm sure the big screen experience would have been enjoyable.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This film has everything you need to have a great film, a great cast, a great storyline and excellent directing.  A classic!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|It is nice having all of the dvds together in one box set.  The blueray edition is wonderful as is the interaction between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  I might not agree with Mel's politics but his movies are sstill terrific.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I bought my 2i2 from Amazon about a year ago ($129) and it is a fantastic piece of gear. I'm really not sure where all the driver issues are coming from, but mine was plug and play on my Vaio Core2Duo 1.8, Win 7 laptop, ASIO4ALL. Interfaced with Reason 6.5 perfectly with low-latency right off the bat. Rode NT1A sounds warm and rich, 18-volt active bass guitar is awesome, and Yamaha Compass series acoustic direct-in sounds full and detailed. The preamps are excellent, transparent (no coloration) and I'll say it yet again - detailed. If you set your gainstages correctly, there is absolutely no lack of headroom. If you need a high-quality two-input interface that's great for on the go or quick setup, this'll do ya. The price is ridiculous for this kind of quality.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was such a fun series of books!  I thought I had tired of post-apocalyptic novels and moved on to all the Artificial Intelligence novels I could find.  But these books kept popping on Amazon as books I might like, and because it was so cheap I decided there really couldn't be a down side to buying them.  I was right!  These books are great!  The characters are compelling and believable and the story grips you and won't let go.<br /><br />Yesterday as I was about to finish the fifth volume, and recommend that my wife start reading them, she came and told me tha one of her friends had started this new series and loved it!  Of course we were talking about Wool.  Now I can't wait to read more from H. Howey.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|NOTEBOOKS<br />Great!  I am using it to do my grocery lists.  Now one time and I have it forever! Also great for any to do list.  I can also use it in my classroom.<br />It took a few minutes to  understand what to do,
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|i am building my collection of LOST, i love this show i don't think there is any other show like this one, and i don't think it will be easy to beat... actors are great, the story line, the plot, and come on Hawaii....
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I was told to watch this \\"Avenger\\" movie first, but I believe it should be watched right before \\"The Avenger's\\" movie.<br />Captain America was the first Avenger, but he was on ice for a few decades while the other Avenger's were being realized. He was from a very different time and place. His story is being told from present day looking back.<br />I know all of the special effects are not perfect, but these professionals are taking stories from the pages of comic books and putting them on he BIG screen. When reading any kind of book, you need a lot of imagination, so I think we should consider that when watching and rating a movie. (some needing more imagination than others, especially with body transformation)<br />I think \\"Captain America\\" is a good all around hero story and like many other young American's he was a hero before he was an \\"Avenger\\".<br />I loved it and I know that I could not do any better for entertainment!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|i am really not a fan of the show, my wife is but when it came out we went to see at the movie theatres, all i can say is the actors did a great job about singing live... oye russel crow!!! stick to gladiator and stuff like that...<br />but if you are a fan of the musical you will enjoy it...
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|The book gave some insights to change your perception of the emotional condition.  I felt it could help to move from guilt to acceptance.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|i am building my collection of LOST, i love this show i don't think there is any other show like this one, and i don't think it will be easy to beat... actors are great, the story line, the plot, and come on Hawaii....
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very good book. I was skeptical about it. When I read the sample I didn't like the individual little stories but I bought it anyway. Don't regret it. Now I can wait to watch the movie.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Really good songs and they sound great. Can't wait to hear it live! Keep giving us great music and videos.
1439156816|2.0|I expected the book to be about writing (since it is titled On Writing), but it turned out to be mostly about Stephen King, his pet peeves, his triumphs, his disappointments, etc. Also, there was much too much reliance on Strunk and White's book, The Elements of Style. I read that book many years ago, and I found it good, but I was looking for something else. Also, all the advice King offers is the same as you would receive in any undergraduate writing course. I was certainly hoping for something more sophisticated.
0802473156|5.0|Best in the business, thanks for your very professional service, I am thrilled and recommend<br />your service at any time.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Even though the style of animal capture is out of date, the story line is strong, the cast is great, and Henry Mancini's score is memorable.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really did not like the one character speaking for one chapter, then the other character speaking for the alternate chapter.  The ending was not satisfying.  Don't know what I wanted, but it seemed to stop abruptly.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This uplifting Christmas classic, in its full and uncommercialed form, is one of the highlights of December at our house.  It is an evening to forget about shopping, wrapping, and decorating, and be reminded of what we really value.
0064440346|4.0|Mouse Tales is my favorite but this was good too. I gave a copy of this book to a local school.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Coming from the cast and crew of so many funny movies, this installment doesn't upset. There are tons of laughs to be had throughout the movie. It's gross, inappropriate, and surprising, which are all of the factors that lead up to humor for me. Some may find the humor offensive, but you should already know this isn't a family movie.<br /><br />I will point out that there was an audio/video quality issue throughout the movie. I contacted Amazon and they assisted me with the issue right away. I highly recommend bringing complications to their attention so that this service is perfected. Amazon Instant Video is an insanely convenient and easy way to rent/buy movies without having to leave your home or go out and buy an AppleTV.<br /><br />Keep it up, Amazon Instant Video!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is just like the other subway surfurs, but still adicting and fun. I remember there was Rio, Easter Egg hunt, and ect. Enjoy!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|What a waste of time.  I kept thinking it was going to get better.  It didn't. Boring and unpleasant. Don't bother with this movie.
B00B04KVMC|3.0|Any way not a big fan of this genre of music by i got to say that the mccartney track is intresting.<br />i love it when paul jumps of his lily pad of comfort and does something like this. the track is thick,fat,and metally. not normal paul style. i love when he takes chances like this. reminds me of the last fireman effort. paul can trully kick ass when he wants to !!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show deserves more than 5 stars. Its thrilling, exciting and emotional.  I recommend this television series to everybody.  Enjoy!
B0071R43MG|4.0|Great concert.  Nice and long.  3d is cool but doesn't add much.  Would be nice if you could select 2d from the menu.
0739333305|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham. This was nicely done, everything from the content of the book to the narrator to the production.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Bonamassa's performance sends chills up your spine! His early love of the guitar began in my hometown of Yorkville, NY years after I left. His talent is awesome!
0062209493|4.0|The overall content of the book was great. The story line was fairly easy to follow and was very interesting. However, the language was quite rough. I started listening to it with my daughter but determined very quickly that it was not appropriate for a 10 year old.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its super fun and i love how you get a coin every 30 seconds because then it adds up in anout 10 minutes
B009MF56GC|4.0|This movie was okay. I liked it but it was overkill. The point was basically blood and violence, which is expected. I liked that, but i didn't really think there was a plot though. One thing i liked the most was that there was a lack of vulgar language. It made the movie more enjoyable for me and my family.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Anyone of loves Bob Marley must own this dvd!! Insightful, personal, well made film about the legend of who made Reggae what it is today. JAH LIVE!
B0053O89K6|5.0|I love this series and this made a great addition to my collection. I love the fact it is blu-ray and i would recommend this procuct and series to anyone, especially to those who love medical shows and extremely interesting characters.
B000BBOUD6|5.0|Legends of the Fall is my favorite movie.  After watching this movie (saw if shortly after it was released) I became a huge fan of Brad Pitt (I also loved him in \\"Kalifornia\\" - he played a serial killer and in \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" - two other films I really enjoyed).  He was amazing in this movie (and so gorgeous - yum). I loved his character \\"Tristen\\". The entire cast did a wonderful job.  So many scenes made me cry and I loved the soundtrack.  I've watched this movie at least thirty times - I highly recommend it (everyone I know who has seen it agrees with me - it was amazing).
B004Z98B1M|5.0|my wife really wanted this film because she is still a very big kid at heart. so i got it for her and with in the first 10 mins of the movie she was crying becasue is was so sweet and sad. SPOILER the wife dies early on. but the film as some really funny parts to it. but like i said just didnt have the normal disney feel for it.
B009VL28W2|1.0|I was getting ready for this awsome blu-ray of a show! I had my surround sound on  and 42&#34; tv ready for loud metal music.<br />ONLY to find out that the disc was defective. It could not be read. I sent it back for a replacement, and (yet again) amazon send me another bad disc. I'll be honest, it played well at first, but then the same message pop up. I know what your thinking. I updated the firmware, I got a lens cleaner, I even took it to get it buffed. When I showed it to the guy he said &#34;Uhhh...there aren't any scratches on the disc.&#34;<br />I've only had the blu-ray player for about a year and it plays other blu-ray discs with no problem so I know it's not that.<br />And as much as I wanted a replacement (AGAIN) they were &#34;out of stock&#34; at the moment so I couldn't. So Im stuck with a disc hoping that it will play through the whole show someday. Seems like a distant dream, a dream that Amazon.com crushed
B000GX05RO|5.0|This book I read in college. It is a view of what was modern psychology in a very intricate , powerful and dangerous world. The drug in this book should be considered like a loaded gun.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I would recommend - especially to anyone who loves flowers.  It was almost an old fashioned book.  A little unbelievable, but kept me reading.
B0041D843M|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It really made me think about the way I eat.  A must read for everyone.  I've been sharing it with everyone around me.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|This was a great movie. Would watchit again and again. Star Trek fan for life! Thank you for the good quality.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I love this movie  I had it in tape so I was delighted to get it in DVD it fun and funny
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love the movie and having it free on Prime!!  Just wish I had closed captions on the kindle- Great movie
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I recently got this and it was a little hard.But after I got the hang of it,it was really addicting.So I would highly recommend this
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book. I wish I would have had this when my kids were younger. Goes well with the 5 love languages for adult children
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey - nuff said!<br />...... But apparently I need more - so let's say that this series is an addiction!
B00846REIS|3.0|Great book for a great night of easy reading. Great for those that need just a little boost for you guessed it.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Every song is enjoyable.  Downloaded it for my fiance and it's great to sit and relax to, or work out with.  Great album.
B004IOVGW0|1.0|I love classic old movies, but this was dumb.  The dialogue was forced and the timing of delivery was awkward and unnatural.  It tried to be funny and was not.  The little sister looked like a full grown woman in braids and a baseball hat saying things like, \\"Aw shucks.\\"  It was almost painful.  Couldn't even finish.  But watched 75% of it because it got good reviews and I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very happy with my Pinterest app for my Kindle Fire, easy to use, and fun to do on my Kindle.
B0058SNJG6|5.0|I love these!!! I am 6 feet tall and have a lot of trouble finding comfortable flats. These slip on easily but don't fall off. I wear them to work and on weekends, since they are so comfortable! They've even bumped my slippers out of use since they are more comfortable than them. Love, love, love!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Awesome series.  Never got decent airplay.  Here's the story of how humanity first went out into the universe in defiance of their Vulcan counselors who felt they were not ready.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Best cop show on television ever. Or darn close to it, anyway. Even the dirtiest cop has a little good in tem, and vice versa
B007REV4YI|1.0|Skyfall was a great movie.  Even people who are not real big Bond fans will love this movie.  It is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great gift for my 15 and 23 year old sons! This is a classic trilogy worth having in the house!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series and cant wait till the third book comes out. I am in love with Gideon and Eva.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am in love with Eva and Gideon. I have read this book like three times and I will probably read it again. To have someone love you as much as Gideon loves Eva is what every women would kill for. I have read both books and can not wait till the third one comes out and I'm hoping it doesn't stop there. Please Sylvia keep the series going. I recomend this series to every women.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I enjoy a movie with history and heart, this has both. From start to finish this story line is linked with wonderful photography to make a complete storyline. You will laugh, you will cry and you will feel good inside. Great movie for young and older.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This movie was an excellent showing of how great God is.  I thank him everyday because everything I possess comes from him.  I have seen this movie many times, but I always have a desire to watch it again.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This is my 3rd time watching this movie on TV.  I just order this movie on yesterday, but I know the storyline by memory.  We have a lot to be thankful for.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|love playing in the tournament mode to see if i can beat my high score and how long it will take;-)
B00BZ5RW64|5.0|The following is a review of the LP version. I played this through a moderately high end set up. I spent the previous week listening to the album in various digital formats and do feel in the end that the album, just like the previous ones, sounds a bit better on vinyl. Of course that's subjective. I understand not everybody has the means or the time to put into vinyl. Regardless any format is better than no format. I encourage you to support the artists. For bands like Volbeat music is their lifeblood. The very air that they breathe. It shows on every record they put out.<br /><br />&#34;Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies&#34;<br /><br />Volbeat isn't a band that any one person can accurately define. Anybody that's compared even two songs from their catalog knows that there's something different within each song. Just look at the genre jump from &#34;Magic Zone&#34; to &#34;Evyln&#34; (a mere two tracks a part from each other on 2010's &#34;Beyond Hell / Above Heaven&#34;).<br /><br />Now that their follow up to &#34;Beyond Hell / Above Heaven&#34; is here you can expect no different. Well, sort of. Volbeat has always been a bit of an oddball amongst their metal brethren. Volbeat continues to draw influence from much earlier artists like Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley and successfully blends it with the more modern sounds of Social Distortion and Metallica capturing their own unique sound, something that's hard to say for a lot of other artists. Perhaps one of the most interesting thing with &#34;Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies&#34; is its overall theme. It doesn't take a genius to figure it out. One look at the painting on the albums cover and a few of the song titles will give you the impression it's all about the more lawless days out west. Not only is the theme particularly appealing to me but it's also an absolutely perfect fit for the guys given their aforementioned influences were often inspired by the same imagery. There are several songs on here that pay tribute to some of the bigger names in wild west folklore. &#34;Black Bart&#34; the famous outlaw who left poetic messages after robbing stage coaches, leading him to be called 'The Gentlemen Bandit.' The lovely Miss Lola Montes gets her dues in the song named after her as well. I think it should also be said that Michael Poulsen's voice soars in this song. I almost felt that everything else took a back seat at times so that he could work his magic. It sounds absolutely amazing. And the lyrics are exceptional.<br /><br />Besides some of the more historical references, Volbeat also managed to slide in a bit of their own concept. &#34;Pearl Hart&#34; seemed to hint at the idea of a Bonnie & Clyde esque couple while &#34;The Nameless One&#34; gives the impression that they sold their souls to a figure representative of death. &#34;Dead But Rising&#34; of course means just that. More importantly I think it's a subtle nod that this couple may not in fact be one hundred percent dead after all in accordance with their previous pact. There are various other concept and story-telling elements present throughout the latter half of the album as well. These of course were all just my interpretations of the songs.<br /><br />The album also features a number of guest musicians. King Diamond lends his vocal and lyrical talents to the song &#34;Room 24&#34; and Sarah Blackwood does backing vocals on &#34;The Lonesome Rider.&#34; This is also Volbeat's first record to feature newly added guitarist, and former Anthrax guitarist, Rob Caggiano.<br /><br />Volbeat has really done something special with this record. Anybody who watched the studio reports that were posted by the band during the recording process will remember Poulsen trying to explain that this album would be a bit different, even for them. At the same time not so different that their fans would be turned away from it. I think that's just right. Volbeat manages to explore a more western theme and sound without writing a straight up country album. Not only that but there's still an overall metal and hard rock vibe to it. Perhaps the greatest thing of all is that it doesn't at any time sound overly cheesy.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have very few games on my kindle fire HD, only because most won't even make the cut. This game, on the other hand, is one of my favorite games ever

0316224588|5.0|Whether Standing in Another Man's Grave is the first detective novel you've read that features John Rebus, or if you read every one of these terrific novels from Ian Rankin, chances are you will enjoy the characters, plot and complexity of this novel. Rebus is an old school detective and while now retired, he is working as a civilian in a cold case unit, and is considering a return to the police force. Having saved the life of a criminal, Ger Cafferty, in a prior novel, Rebus now has a fortnightly drink with Ger. That causes suspicion from an old nemesis of Rebus, DI Malcolm Fox of the Complaints (also known as Internal Affairs or Ethics and Standards). Through good luck, Rebus stumbles into a case, and charges ahead with his usual persistence, instinct, and skill. Some characters from earlier novels show up and the new ones are well drawn. I enjoyed every page of this finely written novel.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It really fun I have had this game for two years except when I add friends they get erased but other than that it's a lot of fun
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Loved this book. Lots of excellent insight into the dynamics of introverted people with friends, spouses, and coworkers. I must read for introverts and the people who love them.
0805095535|3.0|I've never read a Paul Auster book before this one. looking back, I probably should have started with something else. \\"Winter Journal\\" is a deeply emotional and reflective memoir about aging and the passage of time. I think I would have gotten even more out of it if I'd read some more of the author's work beforehand. The other thing that bugged me about this book is the narrative voice, which isn't in the first person and strikes me as kind of odd for a memoir. Still, the writing is fantastic and really draws the reader in. It becomes a very personal experience for the reader, even though this is memoir. I will check out more of the author's earlier works after reading this.
0061777269|5.0|I went back and forth on whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. It is absolutely fascinating, well written and very thorough. So I went with five.<br /><br />But man – I found myself at times grasping maybe a ¼ of what was being said. Some very complex stuff in some parts; well beyond my ability to comprehend Quantum physics, DNA, etc.). I opted for 5 stars because A) what I DID comprehend was simply fascinating, and B) I guess it’s not the authors fault I’m not a scientist.<br /><br />I had read several books on life after death prior to this – so it helped fill in some blanks with good science (as opposed to just interesting anecdotes), and it offered up some really interesting theories on non-local consciousness. I would not recommend this as your first book on this subject  -  but as an ‘advanced’ textbook – it’s definitely worth the extra effort to read…
0812993357|3.0|This can't really be accurately described as an autobiography of a fashion icon. The book, while interesting, doesn't really give you any insight into who Grace Coddington actually is. She definitely is NOT a great writer, but the book is interesting for what it is, which is mainly a collection of notes and lists about Grace's long career in the fashion industry. Fashion enthusiasts will walk away with some interesting tidbits, but don't expect to learn a whole lot about Grace herself.
0374264260|5.0|There is an argument about whether movies are better than the books they are often based upon. This is one of those cases where both the movies and the book have merit for separate reasons. I came to this book via the movie, which I mark as one of my favourites.  However, the book just has much more to give. Of course, that is only to be expected as a Hollywood movie must have reasonable sex and the happiest ending.  This book gives readers fabulous (?) insights into the difficulties people face when coming back from dramatic breakdowns.  There is no easy way back; but there is a way back. Thanks for writing this book.
