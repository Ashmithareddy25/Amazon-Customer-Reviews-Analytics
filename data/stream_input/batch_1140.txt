0140544518|5.0|Changing up the perspective on a classic story is a great way to get children involved and talking about books. This time around the twist in perspective is on the classic fairy tale of the `Three Little Pigs'. First off, Lane Smith's illustrations are fantastic. The color palette of rich oranges, browns, and use of black; along with the quirky perspective and details in the wolf's world, really bring this humorous redux together.<br /><br />The story takes the classic story elements of the original and twists them through the eyes of the Wolf. Of course, according to the Wolf everything that happens is just a series of misunderstandings. Scieszka's play on the old story, is updated with great excuses argued by the wolf, which is reminiscent of a grade schooler's fibs when caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Everyone will be laughing out loud when the Wolf is tried in the court of public opinion via the Pig run media. It seems he never had a chance. Great spin, that is sure to entertain.<br /><br />You may also be interested in the DVD version, with an author/illustrator interview included. [[ASIN:B003X2P9C6 True Story of the Three Little Pigs]]

B0041KKYDI|5.0|Director Danny Boyle (\\"28 Days Later,\\" \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\") adds another sterling addition to his eclectic filmography with \\"127 Hours,\\" a riveting, excruciating film that does for canyoneering what \\"Jaws\\" did for late-night skinny-dipping.     If you summarize \\"127 Hours,\\" it sounds like an after-school special: a man, alone and immobilized, overcomes obstacles and learns important life lessons before returning to his loved ones. That would be accurate but unfair.     The movie centers on Aron Ralston (James Franco in an Oscar-nominated performance), an adrenaline junkie who hit the Utah canyon country in 2003 for some serious derring-do and barely made it out alive. In a dazzling pre-title sequence, Boyle, who also co-wrote the script, shows us exactly why Ralston loves this life; the idyllic scenery also provides the opportunity to meet and impress chicks.     Then it all comes crashing down when Ralston's arm is diabolically pinned to a canyon wall, resulting in no agony (surprising), but no movement (disconcerting). Equipped with a camera, a few gulps of water and some mountaineering gear, he makes the best of it at first. He MacGyver's up a reasonably comfortable roost and sets about finding a path out.     Franco's expressiveness helps you connect to the character as promising possibilities lead to bitter failures. Ralston is at the end of his rope when an epiphany unleashes his will to do what must be done. Boyle is nervy enough not to turn away from the grisly task.     \\"127 Hours\\" demands that you answer the question, \\"Could I hack off my arm to save my life?\\" (If that was a spoiler, you really must be caught under a rock somewhere.) The glib answer is, of course -- who wouldn't cut himself lose? But after experiencing Ralston's ordeal you will have a greater appreciation for what that means.     The extras include several deleted scenes and an extended alternate ending that proves that good scenes must be cut for great storytelling.    Review originallypublished on MyDVDInsider.com
0385738757|3.0|My review will contain spoilers. Please don't read unless you've read the book or don't mind spoilers.            After reading The Maze Runner, I had to follow up and find out what happened. I hoped I'd have some questions answered and we would learn a bit more about WICKED.  Some questions were answered, yes. But then a bunch more were asked and have been left unanswered. Like many others, when Teresa turned on Thomas, I got really angry. Thomas is set up to fail, we know that, but I think that went too far. He now has nothing to hold on to except maybe if there is a cure waiting for them, which I doubt. As you can tell I haven't finished it yet, but I felt compelled to write my review early, as many did, because the situation with Teresa really irritated me.    I personally think Thomas is too obsessed with Teresa. They really didn't have much time to get to know one another again after they lost their memories and he suddenly thinks no one compares to her. His obsession with her annoyed me to no end.     I also felt that there were scenes that were just put there for filler. When I read reviews before reading the book ( I always do that ), I didn't understand why so many people were so upset with the scenes, but now I get it. I also understand why there is a forum about the idea of Teresa being ruined. I loved that Thomas and Teresa could communicate. So if she could communicate with Aris, why didn't Rachel communicate with Thomas?     So many things in this book were good ideas or seemed to be leading up to something great... and then we fall off a cliff... and go nowhere. I think that both The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials should have been much longer. There are YA books out there that are hundreds and hundreds of pages long and have many books in the series. I really think if that happened with The Maze Runner series, it would be much better and the readers would be much happier. I love the idea of these books. So many other people do too. I hope that TheDeath Cure is long and awesome, and our questions are all answered. The Scorch Trials feels rushed, and I think if that happens with The Death Cure, Dashner will have some very upset fans.    I rated this three stars because it did keep me interested. But, it was much more gory and violent. I don't mind that at all but there are some sensitive people out there, and The Maze Runner didn't have that type of gore at all.

B00000DQSS|5.0|I'm one of those rare people who believe it's important to start with an artist's first release, slowly get to know it, and then move on to the 2nd, 3rd, etc. So that means that this is my 3rd Kate Bush album, after [[ASIN:B000006U44 The Kick Inside]] and [[ASIN:B000007MVL Lionheart]].<br /><br />Just by looking at the cover artwork, I suspected this album was going to be an interesting one, and I was definitely right! While maintaining the excellent production values, in terms of vocals and instrumentation, this album goes into a much more experimental direction than the first two albums had gone. One of the first things I noticed is that the instrumentation is a lot \\"bigger\\" and much more powerful than the first two albums. This album is quite a bit darker and has some slightly spooky moments, which, combined with the overall sweetness of Kate's vocals, is really quite unique.<br /><br />Highlights for me are \\"Delius (Song of Summer)\\", \\"All We Ever Look For\\", \\"The Infant Kiss\\", \\"Night Scented Stock\\" (which I'm sure inspired Goldfrapp to write their track \\"Voicething\\" from their 2010 album; [[ASIN:B0036EBARO Head First]]). \\"Army Dreamers\\" and \\"Breathing\\" are absolutely beautiful songs that are just as perfect as \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, but both in totally different ways. Both of these songs were released as singles and charted at number 16 in 1980; which I think shows how the mentality of the public has changed. These days something as beautiful and experimental as these songs probably wouldn't even be on the chart at all... The last minute or so of \\"Breathing\\" is incredibly powerful, and makes me just want to listen to the entire album again, and again, and again. I'm always listening to music, and I have a LOT of stuff to choose from, so it's very rare that I came across an album that I can listen to on repeat (which I have done for most of today!).<br /><br />This album is, in my opinion, much better than \\"The Kick Inside\\" and \\"Lionheart\\". As the cover artwork suggests, I think Kate let a lot of what was inside her to release and the result was a magical, moving, unique, and incredibly powerful album that is just pure art in every way.<br /><br />Anybody reading this review who is thinking of exploring Kate's music, I would strongly suggest starting with the first album, then the second, and then this one. \\"Never For Ever\\" seems to be, sadly, overshadowed by Kate's later work. I actually read a review saying that this album is \\"too much of a transition to be considered a masterpiece\\". I'm quite glad that I haven't yet heard her later albums so that I can't compare this one to them and, in the process, spoil my own enjoyment of this absolutely beautiful, amazing, and moving album. I consider it to be a masterpiece!<br /><br />If it's true what so many people say about Kate's later albums being better than this, then I really do have a lot to look forward to...et a lot of what was inside her to release and the result was a magical, moving, unique, and incredibly powerful album that is just pure art in every way.

B000U0F7RG|3.0|I started watching Gilmore Girls in college when it was still on the air but nearing the end of its run. I fell in love with the show and watched the first five seasons over and over again over the next several years until six and seven came out on dvd, then watched those one through also. So why am I giving it 3 stars you ask?<br />I am currently 24 years old, and have lost any love I might have had for the show in the beginning. TV that I enjoy has always had growing, smart characters. These characters are definitely smart, but the last episode of the series, they are acting exactly the same as they did in the first. They never grew. They always had the same problems and made the same decisions.<br />For example, my parents are overbearing and anything that happens around them is horrible! OK, that might be true, but couldn't you find a better way of dealing with it than acting like a whiny 10 year old at 35? Rory's relationships always started out nicely, but it seems the writers were obsessed with making the male characters in the show out to be dogs because every single male character in the show save Lorelai's father became a whiny bitch by the end of his turn (Usually within about 2 seasons of him being cast). That was intensely frustrating for me, and after watching the entire show two or three times, I couldn't ignore the frustrating side anymore.<br /><br />This show is good for watching once through, but its shelf life is not more than the time it takes the viewer to grow past the immaturity of the characters.<br />What I learned from Gilmore Girls:<br />Rich people are evil, thoughtless ***holes.<br />Any man you start a relationship with will inevitably end up as a clawing whiny bitch.<br />Girls are so much cooler than boys.<br />The only use for boyfriends is to be your man slave.<br />Anything that requires physical effort should be performed by men.<br />Girls should not know how to use tools of any kind.<br />and...republicans are evil!<br /><br />Believe it or not, I am female, I just don't think that after seven years, the characters should still be in the same relationships doing the same stupid crap. First and second season, maybe even third, I'd let that stuff slide because there was still a lot of room for growth. However, by the fifth season, nothing had changed and sixth and seventh I forced myself to watch because I wanted to see if it ever got better.<br /><br />If you're stunted in your growth and want to continue watching the same stupid patterns of behavior over seven seasons, this show is for you. If you want a show with growth, find something else!that after seven years, the characters should still be in the same relationships doing the same stupid crap.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The idea of kingship depends on the notion that the king surpasses the limitations God has foisted on the rest of us -- God has chosen this man to lead an entire nation, after all. Tom Hooper's \\"The King's Speech,\\" winner of last year's Best Picture Oscar, turns this idea on its head by showing us a king who desperately wishes to be an everyman, but by fighting to do his duty becomes all the more heroic.     It's the late 1930s, and Prince \\"Bertie\\" Albert (Colin Firth) reluctantly skulks around the periphery of the royal family thanks to a horrible stammer. Consider the cosmic injustice of it all; not only do people (wrongly) equate stammering with idiocy, Bertie is condemned to lead England -- land of Shakespeare -- during the advent of the radio. No longer could a monarch lead by posing for a portrait astride a noble steed: public speaking was mandatory.    Cruel fate conspired to thrust Bertie onto the global stage when his elder brother Edward (Guy Pearce) shockingly abdicated the throne to marry an American divorcee just about the time Hitler decided to unleash his insanity upon the world. All in all, it's fair to say that for a royal, Bertie couldn't catch a break.     That is, until his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) locates an unorthodox speech therapist. Although his clientele consists of supremely ordinary folks and, even worse, he's Australian, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) knows his stuff, including the difficult truth that stammering often stems not from mental defects but from emotional damage. Logue learns that for a man born with every seeming advantage Bertie has endured much.     The relationship between these two men forms the heart of this movie, and it is riveting. Firth, who received the Oscar for Best Actor, embodies the man who hates to talk but is condemned to speak to the nation as it spins toward WWII. Bertie's flaw is so universal (who hasn't been terrified to speak in public?) and he faces it with such courage that you just can't help rooting for the guy. Rush, on the other hand, breathes new life into the clichéd unconventional teacher role.     Gorgeously shot by Danny Cohen, \\"The King's Speech\\" is stand-up-and-cheer moviemaking. Extras include commentary tracks, a filmed Q&A with the cast and an entertaining interview with Logue's grandson.    Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.

B0001AP12G|5.0|None of Kanye's albums after this were as good. I loved all of them, but this one is still the best. Lots of Kanye fans think \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is his best, although I think it's this one that's the best. \\"The College Dropout\\" conbines meaningful and well-thought lyrics along with catchy and emotional beats creating a album with a big backbone. There's a lot of dimension to this record and it packs a lot of lyrical content that's very unique in rap. It ranges from school metaphors to classical-influences to old-school-influences and back to school metaphors over head-bobbing beats. Altogether, this is a very great rap debut from Ye.        The opener, \\"Intro\\", with Bernie Mac, is a great way to open up the album. It's only 19 seconds of him talking, but it really is a nice segue into the next song, and the whole album altogether. The next song is \\"We Don't Care\\". It's one of my favorite songs off \\"The College Dropout\\". I love the sample and the lyrics are very clever and real. The chorus is also an amazing part! \\"Graduation Day\\" is a really good 1 1/2 minute interlude that's a bit of an add on to \\"We Don't Care\\". It starts with an outraged Bernie Mac yelling and it finally moves into a great violin-and-handclap beat with John Legend singing with a vocoder. \\"All Falls Down\\" is the next song, and I have to say, I love the old-school feel to it. The Lauryn Hill sample works great with the song along with a melodic flow and school-inspired lyrics to the song. It deserves a big spot on the album and I'm glad it was released as a single. \\"I'll Fly Away\\" is another 1 1/2 minute interlude, and it's an old school Motown salute that moves greatly into the next song, \\"Spaceship\\". This song has a very nice and laid-back beat with great lyrics about Kanye being underestimated by his bosses. The verses are very clever.        \\"Jesus Walks\\" is another one of my favorites, with some of the best lyrics on the album. It has an amazing sample with the children'schoir and the whole song and message is very unique. I love it! \\"Never Let Me Down\\" is another song. The troubling lyrics fit along with the emotional beat. Jay-Z's verse at the end is one of my favorite parts of the song, definitely, along with the chorus. \\"Get Em High\\" is just a partying song (you can kinda tell by the title), and it has an amazing beat and this song totally relieves all the emotional tension throughout the album, because it's the first \\"fun\\" song on the album, and it has great verses. \\"Workout Plan\\" is 46 seconds is two ghetto girls talking and it's pretty hilarious, as it moves into the actual song \\"The New Workout Plan\\". It has a very unique flavor to it, because it talks about a workout plan from Kanye. It's very clever and I love the clever outro with all the females talking about the workout plan. It's definitely the most entertaining song on the album. \\"Slow Jamz\\" was a hit back on '03 and I really love it. It's Kanye, Twista, and Jamie Foxx saluting old-school R&B with an old school motown and R&B influenced beat. It mentions many different Motown and R&B legends (Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, and many different names). It deserved to win the Grammy is was nominated for.       \\"Breathe in Breathe Out\\" is one of the songs on this album that I remember a lot even after all these years. I love the beat, mixed with horns, bass, and a head-bobbing drum beat. The chorus with Ludacris is great, too. It's one of those that you could just sing along to. It's really amazing. The two \\"School Spirit\\" skits are pretty funny, adding on some humor to the album. I also love the actual \\"School Spirit\\" song. It has a great Aretha Franklin sample (it's clean even on the explicit version, since Aretha wouldn't allow the sample if it had curses in it). Everything about the song is great to me. The \\"Lil Jimmy\\" skit adds more humor on to the album, while it moves into a dramatic choir rap, with \\"Two Words\\" (it has the Harlem Boys Choir in it, so that choir addson to more drama in this song). The sample is also another great part of this song. \\"Through the Wire\\" is a great rap song with the lyrics talking about his car accident a few years before the album release. He had his mouth wired shut while recording it, but, like he says in the beginning of the song \\"They can't stop me from rapping, can they, huh?\\". It shows that even though he would slur with his mouth wired shut, he can still rap fine, and that's one of the reasons why this is one of my favorites on this album.       My favorite song on the album works great as the second-to-last song. \\"Family Business\\" is definitely my absolute favorite song. It's very relatable song, and I think everybody could relate to it. He raps about his childhood and family struggles and I love the beat, sample, and everything else. It's one of my favorite rap songs. \\"Last Call\\" is phenomenal as the closing song. It begins with Jay-Z talking for a bit, and the song talks about his career over a great and sampled beat and for about 8 1/2 minutes, he talks about how he got his record deal, so altogether the song is 12 minutes and 40 seconds long. It definitely tells a great story, with moving into a new house, getting a deal with Capitol Records (and later getting booted off), and finally talks about his record deal with Roc-a-Fella.       \\"The College Dropout\\" is definitely one of the most inventive and unique rap albums. This album really marked the start of a very successful career    My top 3 favorites:  1. Family Business  2. Jesus Walks  3. We Don't Care  10/10!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Radio channels work better than any other app,  however I got this because I wanted the weather radio and that doesn't work.  The fire and EMS would also be a great feature but again it doesn't work.  They just sit there saying opening stream.  I hope this is fixed soon and then I would give the fifth star

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is the second time I've purchased the complete series of a tv show. And I'm already wondering which one to buy next. Not only do you have great acting and story lines (in the case of West Wing and Six Feet Under), but the packaging of the boxed set is clever and fun. Six Feet Under came in a box with astroturf on one side. West Wing comes as a set of file folders in an attache-case style box with the presidential seal. And it seems that \\"used\\" can mean like-new, but with an insignificant ding or two. If I were trying to collect mint sets, I would care. But since I'm not, I see it as a great opportunity to save money. And it arrived the day after I purchased it -- which was an unexpected bonus.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a good game, plays well on HTC Evo4G, wish the game was a bit longer and allowed more possibilities so more ways to make mistakes (thus harder). But its a fun game.

B004L49K20|5.0|All you need is now is the best duran album since the weddiing album, maybe even earlier.  There is no bad song on this album and with the help of producer Mark Ronson, Duran Duran have created a masterpiece. From the title song to Before the Rain, Safe (in the heat of the moment) with an amazing cameo of Ana Matronic from the Scissor Sisters, Girl Panic!, and fan favorite The Man Who Stole A Leopard, AYNIN is a perfect album and deserves the rave reviews and the industry support that they have been denied during their 30 year career. This is an album that is loved and adored by Duranies but should be on the playlists of everyone, the band has created a piece of art....perfectly.
B004X80QNG|5.0|this app, on any platform is always one of the best. we all know the difficulty in programming for android market. this developer had been replying to everyone. I am using this and am very impressed with project to date and responses do far. I know it will be a six.
B004VN5MNC|5.0|Emiranda, not sure what happened but when I purchased the Deluxe Version, I was able to download two videos (Walk (live @ the Roxy) and White Limo) plus the Digital Booklet which is the artwork from the cd. No problems.I am using Windows Media Player, not sure what you are using. Maybe they downloaded but you didn't find them?   The videos- Walk (live at the Roxy) Very good live footage,with crowd shots as well as the band (mostly Dave of course). Great sound with no crowd noise (maybe the song dubbed over the video?)   White Limo- Hilarious video complete with a hot babe, vomiting, and the craziest limo driver ever.    Better Off is the extra track and fits with the rest of the songs on the album. The \\"Rope (Deadmau5 mix) really doesn't do anything for me but Better Off is worth the extra money.

Depends on my mood, I enjoyed this book immensely and will read other novels Martin has written. I enjoyed the way he portrays different characters personalities and the unpredictability of his plot lines. Martin kept me guessing and wondering, which are what all stories should do. I have also read the following novel that I enjoyed:  [[ASIN:1908200138 Viking Sword Saxon Shield]]
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I got this app for listening to local stations but none (well 1 out of 6) of the stations I listen to showed up.  The police radio was unavailable.  So at that point I don't really have a use for it and I'm  uninstalling.  However if it did have my stations it would be with having.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game, but just way too short. Memory is everything. You really have to pay attention to everything because you never know what might be a clue. Overall, a fun game to kill some time if you have nothing else to do.
B000002ADT|5.0|It arrived quickly, in excellent condition, and the album, well... I was replacing the last one I had after a friend \\"borrowed\\" it and never returned it.  I guess some people just can't live without it.  Everyone knows it's awesome.

Really Good Book
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Jigsaw is back, but his disease is defeating him little by little. Amanda's story is further detailed and how her relationship with John built over the last year or so in the timeline. The bathroom scene with Amanda and John was great to see as the set up for the game was in motion. How Amanda's emotions would get the best of her and killing Adam was sad to see. In the end, Saw III was great and will lead into an awesome sequel with a bigger revalation.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Having been a long-time Rush fan, I was skeptical about buying another repackaged item.  I was wrong!  If you are even a marginal Rush fan, BUY THIS DVD set!  The honesty and musicality throughout the video is amazing.  Rush is not pretentious in any way and their sense of humor has me laughing out loud.  I always knew about the vaguely (if ever) referred to original member John Rutsey.  I never knew many details that answered questions I had for many years about his role.  Don't get me wrong; I would pay the admission price to a Rush concert just to hear a Peart solo or hear Geddy wail on that bass and play the synth. or watch Lifeson work his own magic, EFFORTLESSLY!  You will just have to get the video to understand Rutsey's vital place in the band's formative years.  When you hear them play Working Man in that small school auditorium venue, it will send chills down your spine.  I LOVE Rush and always will.  They are true brothers in every sense.  What a rare treat to have them still together after all these decades cranking out music that makes you feel.  Louis - San Antonio
0307704610|1.0|This book is a bachelor's journey and is not a suitable plan for everyone, especially those with food addiction. I was deeply angry about the author saying it's okay to have a pig out day that is like telling alcoholics or crack cocaine addicts to binge one day a week and remain sober and self control throughout the other six days a week.  This book is not for all to follow, so don't believe in the hype of this book. To me this book emphasize about a man's journey to better self, not a book designed for all especially those who are overweight, or have eating disorders. This is a disappointment, so don't waste your time in buying or investing time into reading it, it is simply not worth it.

By co-winning the annual slaughtering event, she will spend the rest of her life in luxury, with her family fed and in good living conditions. She continues to hunt in the woods around her home, and donates what she can to the poor in her area.<br /><br />But Katniss' actions at the conclusion of the Games have made her a hero in other districts as well. Her refusing to kill her co-tribute, Peeta, and instead having the two attempt suicide in an effort to both survive has made her the Mockingjay, the symbol of revolution. After seventy-five years under the thumb of the Capitol, the people in the surrounding districts have had enough. It's a lot for a teenage girl to handle, especially when the president of Panem visits her house and tells her he knows what she's up to.<br /><br />In \\"Catching Fire\\", the second book in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy, we see the consequences of trying to thumb your nose at authority. Though Katniss' motives at the end of the previous novel were made for survival, her fellow citizens have taken them in another light. Her Victory Tour is a dry-run for several uprisings, and when changes begin to happen in District 12, she fears for not only her life but those that she cares about. Unfortunately, those in the Capitol have another trick up their sleeve - one that, while meant to quash revolution, instead ignites it.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Hunger Games\\" you will devour its sequel. I managed to make my way through it in a matter of hours, hanging on to every word. Many of the background characters introduced in the first novel - such as Haymitch - begin to take a more central role, and we meet some great new people as well. For those of you who have not yet read the first one, you'll have to do so in order to understand what happens here. Unlike the last one, this ends in a cliffhanger, built up with one surprise after another.

0895260131|5.0|The only religion that hasn't evolved past it's violent beginning is islam so what does that say about the faith that so many muslims live and I say live because a muslim lives their religion unlike other religions that acknowledge their faith but muslims live the life and everything they do revolves around islam.        If any other faith lived their religion to the extent muslims do they would be called a cult member so the faith runs very deep in islam and many have died for being critical of islam so this author is very brave IMO.        I know every religion has their diehard followers that go a little too far sometimes but only one of these religions will kill you when their followers take it too far and that is islam.
0307593495|3.0|I've read and enjoyed all the Wallander books, including the one featuring his daughter, and assumed that was the last one where Wallander appeared as a character. It should have been. Toward the middle of \\"Troubled Man,\\" the book begins to feel like the old Henning Mankell, but the first half is told in a plodding, summarizing manner, like a long version of a plot summary. Characters are not developed, scenes are not vividly portrayed. It is as if Mankell felt forced by his public and/or his publisher when he had decided not to, and resented the task. So, he provides a grudging first half, then a disappointing ending which makes it clear, finally, that there will never be another Kurt Wallander novel. I enjoyed most of the latter half of the book, and unlike some others I also enjoyed his musings on aging and death (I found out I had diabetes the same age he did, and am 60 now, wondering about some of the same issues), so this didn't bother me. Instead it was what seems to be the author's resentment of having to write the book that troubled me.
B00005B74X|5.0|Volunteers is the last really great Jefferson Airplane album.  There is a good variety of types of music, from heavy/acid rock to light country satire on themselves, to the famous title track.  I still enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />I remember that Volunteers came out on LP, and a short time later a new version came out in Quadraphonic - a surround format that never caught on.  For one reason or another, to make a Quad version of the album, they decided to re-record these tracks.  Perhaps they were able to render the other four tracks from the original takes.<br /><br />The point is, these are entirely different takes by the same band members a short time later.  They don't play or sing them exactly the same: it is similar, but with some obvious differences.  Volunteers starts off with a bit of a jam before Marty starts singing, and the lyrics include \\"one generation gone ahead, one generation went to bed, c'mon now, we can do it, we can do ANYTHING\\" and this is not in the original take.  Wooden Ships starts right in on the music, with no boat sound effects of fading into the music.  Hey Frederick has Grace experimenting with a different phrasing of some of the lyrics.  The sound seems a bit brighter than the 2004 remaster.<br /><br />Though the tracks were recorded for quad, they are presented in stereo for this release.  It certainly would be interesting to have quad recordings by the Airplane and others published today in DTS or Dolby Digital.<br /><br />If you love the Volunteers album, I do recommend you check out these alternate takes.<br /><br />Also, if you have not heard Paul Kantner's \\"Blows Against The Empire\\", you might want to check it out.  It could have been the last great Airplane album (it came out after Volunteers) except that it has a different lineup: only four members of the Airplane, and a variety of guests (including Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, David Crosby, and others).  It also introduced the name Jefferson Starship, though the real band of that name came four years later.years later.
B004PGO25O|4.0|\\"This is what you deserve. You could be good today. But instead you choose tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />--Marcus Aurelius<br /><br />I am not a rereader of books.  I prefer to try the new as opposed to revisiting the old.  But there are two books I reread every year, that are constantly with me, both in physical form and on my mind.  The first is Marcus Aurelius's stoic masterpiece on how to live a life, \\"The Meditations.\\" The best thing ever written in my opinion.  The second is Steven Pressfield's \\"The War of Art,\\" a brief manifesto on how to \\"break through the blocks and win your inner creative battles.\\"  This book has helped me immensely in my own writing output.<br /><br />This week sees the release of the companion manifesto to \\"The War of Art,\\" the second Domino Project release \\"Do the Work.\\"<br /><br />In \\"War of Art,\\" Pressfield introduced the idea of The Resistance, that unexplainable inner force that prevents us from accomplishing things.  Something we all suffer from, yes, but something some of us are better at managing.<br /><br />I met so many people on my 30 Bars in 30 Days book tour who had their own apparent dreams of writing a novel.  They'd see my book and go, \\"A self-hurt guide?  Ha.  I don't need to buy that.  I could have written that!\\"<br /><br />And, I'd always snap back, \\"Well you didn't.  I did.\\"<br /><br />They couldn't have written it.  Because they'd also wonder:  \\"So, how long'd it take to write HOW TO FAIL?\\"  When they found the answer was several years of intense effort, you could see the look of fear and self-doubt and mercy in their eyes.  They would never do that work.  Too much Resistance to overcome.  Too much lack of immediate gratification.  Too unreasonable to write that long with no road map laid out, with no potential reward.<br /><br />I know other writers, good writers, that just can't quite finish things.  They have 90% of a manuscript, 95% of a screenplay, but they're frozen with an inability to complete the work.  It's not perfect.  It's not good enough.  It could suck.  It could flop.  It's not \\"ready.\\"  What does that even mean?  It's means The Resistance is defeating them.  It means they are being too rational.  \\"Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego,\\" says Pressfield.<br /><br />It's too easy to think how utterly ridiculous it is to write a novel or make a movie or start a company or even get six-pack abs.  No one you know does these things so you become an outlier amongst your friends and family for even attempting them.  You become a source of mockery even for having such outlandish dreams.<br /><br />Thus, we are forced to become unconscious in our own work if we have these unreasonable dreams.  \\"Let the unconscious do its work,\\" say Pressfield.  I do this through irrational confidence in the future success of my work.  And by drinking.  No better way to release the unconscious, to be irrational, to silence The Resistance in me than by popping a few beers or nursing a few glasses of bourbon.<br /><br />(Yeah, I know this is unorthodox thinking, I doubt the fine Mr. Pressfield endorses it, but it works for me, and I've written two more books than 99% of you.)<br /><br />Pressfield wants to encourage us to release this \\"second self, an unlived you\\" from inside of us.  The second self that wants to write books, make movies, etc. but keeps convincing himself otherwise for the most silly and rational reasons.<br /><br />\\"Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur's indispensable allies.\\"  Again, drinking helps get that ignorance and arrogance released, just like the sauced lout hitting on every pretty thing at the bar, thinking he's as suave as George Clooney.<br /><br />\\"Don't think.  Act.\\"  Drink some more.  \\"Get your idea down on paper.  You can always tweak it later.\\"  Drink.  Then start writing.<br /><br />Be impetuous.  Drink.  Quit having an inner critic that judges you, that prevents you from doing things.  Drink.  And become impervious to it all.<br /><br />Work isn't pretty.  Writing and creating art is just as primitive as hoeing fields.  Pressfield says it's \\"better to be primitive than sophisticated, and better to be stupid than smart.\\"  Drink, drink, drink and you'll be pretty damn primitive and stupid eventually.  Pressfield uses the indelible image of a women giving birth:<br /><br />\\"The hospital room may be spotless and sterile, but birth itself will always take place amid chaos, pain, and blood.\\"<br /><br />To produce work we have to get dirty, we have to have this killer instinct, focusing only on the work at hand and the joy in creating it, and ignoring every inner and outer voice of resistance around us.  \\"The War of Art\\" laid the ground work for tackling Resistance, \\"Do the Work\\" gives you the road-map.  And, I'd add, a few drinks will give you the courage to slay the dragon of Resistance.<br /><br />\\"Do the Work\\" is free on Kindle until May 20 so I'd pick that up now, but I'd also grab \\"The War of Art.\\"  I think that's a better overall book and a better place to start conquering The Resistance.  Both these books could be knocked off over this weekend (perhaps while having a few drinks).  No better time to start than the present.  Then, on Monday, you can begin doing your own work.fields.

B000I0SGX0|5.0|At such a bargain price this box set really should be snatched by everybody who loves the piano music of Franz Liszt. For here you get complete recordings of two magisterial cycles - 'Annees de Pelerinage' and 'Harmonies Po&eacute;tiques et Religieuses' (the latter vastly under-recorded in toto) - as well as several complete sets of pieces - the three Liebestr&auml;ume (there is no such piece by Liszt as 'Liebestraum'), the six Consolations, the two Ballades, and the two Legendes. As a special bonus, the fifth CD (and the only one digitally recorded, in the 1980s) offers an excellent selection of operatic paraphrases, ranging from Gounod and Donizetti to Verdi and Wagner.<br /><br />Aldo Ciccolini is one of those rare pianists who can play with tremendous power and rather on the fast side, yet manage somehow not to sound vulgar or bombastic. His weak point are the more lyrical moments where he falls rather short of what a Jorge Bollet might offer you. The Consolations and the Liebestr&auml;ume are rushed and insensitive, though neither of the sets is entirely without merit. Ciccolini's Tarantella, Dante Sonata and Second Ballade are probably some of the fastest on record. They do lack subtlety, but there is an exhilarating passion to compensate for that. Likewise, signor Ciccolini largelly misses the poetry of the Ballades and most of the pieces from 'Harmonies Po&eacute;tiques et Religieuses', but even in its wildest moments his playing never degenerates into the mindless banging so fashionable nowadays among 'Liszt interpreters'; his rather fast tempi sound really quite refreshing, especially considering the modern vogue for slow motion which is misguidedly equalled with musicianship.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this set is superbly recorded and spectacularly played. Annees de Pelerinage is the highlight in both aspects: the sound has amazing depth and clarity for recording from the early 1960s (and for EMI at that) and Ciccolini's devil-may-care virtuosity is just about irresistible. I have yet to hear more powerful and more profound renditions of 'Chapelle de Guillaume Tell' and 'Orage' - even Bolet and Berman couldn't match Ciccolini's grandeur here. The two Legendes come pretty close to that level and so do most of the operatic transcriptions, most notably the famous Waltz from Gounod's 'Faust', Isolde's Libestod from Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' and especially Liszt's amazing paraphrases of themes from Verdi's 'Aida' and 'Il Trovatore'. These are almost literaly hair-raising recordings. But very musical too.<br /><br />If you are fan of Liszt's piano works played in a powerful manner with a great deal of freedom in terms of dynamics and tempi, this box-set is definitely for you. It is a steal at that price.<br /><br />P.S. The booklet is utterly disappointing, poorly written rambling of little if any value.

B004SEUJKU|2.0|This is the fourth release of this film on blu-ray already. There is the 2006 original, a 2009 lenticular cover version, a 2010 blu-ray/DVD combo and now this 2011 blu-ray book. While I won't debate the merits of the film itself, MGM is currently in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings and I assume this is the primary reason for this new release. Unfortunately, they haven't bothered upgrading the original MPEG-2/LPCM 2006 mastering of the film itself; all the versions contain identical disc content. If you don't already own this film and want a fancy book style package for a 5 year old blu-ray master, go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise, you're better off finding a less expensive older version.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Not a lot to say other than this production had the time to develop the characters better and did not leave out major and important elements of the story as the recent and popular production with Kira Knightly.  Kira is lovely to look at in that production but she was not given the time to actually be the character Austen created.  The BBC/A&E version gives that time and does not overly fantasize the story.  It's absolutely a must buy for any Austen fan, and maybe for any Colin Firth at that.  Firth is just downright excellent in any role he takes on.  The best actor going these days, even better than Mr. Hanks if I may say so and it is saying a lot.

B000002AQH|5.0|Schumann was the master of the epigram - there's no-one better. Indisputably, his genius became more brittle when applied to larger forms or divorced from his lodestar of Clara or his own romantic interests. Unwisely, he nested enough turkeys to underwrite Thanksgiving: the Mass, those endless Ballads, Genoveva, the Julius Casear Overture - but this work is not one of them. Schumann was deeply besotted with Faust throughout his life. It drew fire from him.<br /><br />This work has never received uncritical praise and recordings of it are rare. Invariably - if not lazily - the Overture is pilloried. A distinction is normally made between the more lyrical Part 3 (which was written earlier) and the two preceding parts (which are more overtly dramatic). The former is much preferred.<br /><br />To my mind, yes, Schumann grounds out the Overture but in its own morbid way, it perceptively comments on Faust's own labours and toil. And from there on, indisputably, the magic flows mightily. Listen for instance to the conclusion of Part 2 - is it not a wonder of the world?<br /><br />I am no fan of Uncle Claudio. The unique Klang of the Berlin Phil ebbed away under his ten year tenure. Wasn't there an 1812 overture . . . a Dvorak Ninth . . . . a Beethoven cycle that was furtively withdrawn from circulation . . . . . . mmmmmh, a lean harvest indeed! To my mind, this recording is one of the few items that can be salvaged from his helmsmanship at the Philharmonie. He is greatly abetted by the overwhelming Faust of Bryn Terfel who sings like a god. The recording per se also offers an alternative to those who are deeply allergic to Peter Pears and/or Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau on the Decca recording. One should also add that the sonics are first-class.<br /><br />All in all, this recording makes the best possible case for a wrongly maligned masterpiece. Try it. And then as Schumann would say, read the damned book!
B004XONUGU|4.0|I'll go ahead and say it, this was not my favorite episode. Clark and Lois are the only characters from the main cast that make an appearance and the only reoccurring role is Kat Grant (who I detest, although she becomes a little more palatable by the end of the episode). It had a good story, but it just seemed to be missing something else along with the absent characters. That being said, in this episode we see Clark trying to be the bumbling reporter we know from other Superman shows/movies and it really does a lot to solidify Clark's move in that direction. Also, the episode ended quite well, with a few unexpected turns of events. This ending is why I gave the episode 4 stars and not 3. It's defiantly worth watching. I can't wait to see the remaining episodes.

B002AGIEYG|2.0|Sir Simon is starting to morph into the \\"Great Conductor\\". Prior to his Berlin appointment, he never displayed any affinity with the likes of Schubert, Strauss, Brahms, Bruckner and what not. Twenthieth Century music and Mahler were his forte. Recent recordings have belied this state of affairs (tick, Schubert; tick, Strauss; tick, Bruckner; tick, Brahms), however variable the results might be (the Schubert & Bruckner 4th are uber-howlers). After all, if one is to occupy the throne of Caesar, one has to act accordingly - yes? Could one doubt that a New Year's Eve concert in Vienna is on the cards for the Beknighted One, who has long harboured a secret love of the Blue Danube . . . . ?<br /><br />To the cycle in question. It is ravishingly played. It is well enough recorded. It is very listenable.<br /><br />But is it the Logos, written anew? Does it bring us any closer to The Beard? Does it set one afire with new imperatives?<br /><br />Nah, not really - if at all. To my mind, Rattle's main problem is that he becomes flaccid when the score is in 'second or third' (usually the former). The tension, accordingly, recedes away. Sir Simon usually delivers in the big 'fifth gear' moments but all in all, it makes for a jumpy affair.<br /><br />The famous horn call in the last movement of the First is drab as is the tracery of the strings that accompany it - is it really the Berlin Philharmonic??? More limpness can be found at 14:26 - 14:40 of the same movement.<br /><br />Has there ever been a more prosaic opening to the Second Symphony? There is no evidence of a 'masterful tentativeness' on the part of the conductor in recognition that the music that is about to unfold is gossamer-like in its fragility; Rattle cycles through it with that smirk on his face. The last movement is bereft of genuine animal exitement.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in saying this is the lamest Brahms Three ever recorded by the Berlin Philharmonic - even the Karajan '88 has more drive to it. Excruciatingly, Rattle observes the repeat in the first movement as most of the limpness is to be found in the exposition. It is lacklustre in the extreme. It beggars belief that people could laud it to the skies.<br /><br />Let us turn our attention to Rattle's Fourth and its opening movement:<br /><br /> - There is little real menace in the opening, which is not to be equated with playing loud and aggressively.<br /> - 3:09 - 3:14, a key transition, has as much bite as Grandma Moses the False Teeth Warrior.<br /> - 3:50 - 4:18 has no inner tension.<br /> - 4:42 - 4:56 how bland.<br /> - 5:27 - 5:30 another missed opportunity - the meek shall inherit the earth - or shall they?<br /> - 6:10 - 6: 48 OMG we finally have some adrenaline though it quickly evaporates.<br /> - 7:41 - 8:04 This is a key momement in the Fourth. Furtwangler, Karajan and Kleiber all imbue it with an extraordinay menace. In Rattle's hands, it is a non-event.<br /> - 8:48 onwards Rattle finally develops some innate momentum. The movement ends well - if only the tension had not been compartmentalised to this section! Even so, it has to be said that at 12:48 - 12:59 Rattle is no match for any of the Big Three; a dollop of genuine terror is missing.<br /><br />Now to the last movement:<br /><br />0:00 - 0:16 what a flaccid opening. Again, it is completely devoid of tension.<br />0:17 - 3:17 not bad at all, bordering on impressive. Go for it Simon !<br />4:03 - 6:05. Alas, the tension recedes away again. A genuine elegy it ain't - it's just accomplished playing from the Berliners.<br />6:39 - 7:15 - impressive<br />7:19 - 7:26 - it takes a real master to make something of these transitions - it is not in evidence here.<br />7:38 - 7:53 - super impressive - in the Furtwangler class.<br />8:08 - 8:51 onwards it is back to Droop City.<br />9:16 onwards Sir Simon shifts into the high gears and floors it winningly.<br /><br />Note: I have adopted such a modular approach because Rattle lacks the end-to-endgrip of a Furtwangler or Karajan.<br /><br />Comparisons beckon.<br /><br />For all its sonic limitations, the Furtwangler 4th from November 1943 - a genuine bat out of Hell - eclipses the offering in question; its sonic glory aside, how pedestrian is Rattle's last movement by comparison (the Gates to the Underworld stay firmly locked). The Karajan 2nd from 1986 is unchallenged. The Guilini 3rd from Vienna on DG, with its lustrous feel for the long lines, is still the one to have. Rattle offers a more substantial challenge in the First - with fewer agogic distortions than in the other three symphonies - but the Karajan from 1963 is its equal in the very least.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's immortal advice \\"a man's gotta know his limitations' is pertinent at this point; Rattle should stick to his core repertoire. Perhaps, better still, he should have stayed in Birmingham where there was less pressure on him to morph into a Great Conductor; there, he could crank out the Ades to his heart's content. It begs the question: why did he take the Berlin job?<br /><br />Hark, was that Icarus I saw in the sky?grip of a Furtwangler or Karajan.<br /><br />Comparisons beckon.<br /><br />For all its sonic limitations, the Furtwangler 4th from November 1943 - a genuine bat out of Hell - eclipses the offering in question; its sonic glory aside, how pedestrian is Rattle's last movement by comparison (the Gates to the Underworld stay firmly locked).

B001UV4XI8|3.0|Before my critique, let me say this is by far my favorite Potter film. Everything about it, from story to characters, is fantastic. I was thrilled when I read about the extras, especially the Maximum Movie Mode which has pop-ups that tell you information about the making of the film and the story behind the story.  THIS is where things go wrong, at least on my copy. The Maximum Movie Mode is filled with glitches. Some clips have NO AUDIO, others freeze while still others pop-up 5 seconds before a break in the story, which would make a logical place for an explanation to be offered. I'm not sure if this is an issue with just my copy or a loss of product quality because the Blu-Ray/DVD was rushed out for money making purposes.  Again the movie is great, IT plays fine. However, the technical glitches are infuriating.
B004WKI204|5.0|This book is Tina Fey at her absolute best. It is a fantastic insight into the inner workings of that fabulous comedic kind that we all know and love from 30Rock and SNL. Tina opens the door to her past so that we can see the path Tina took to get to where she is today. The book very much feels like Tina is in your head narrating in her own quirky way- it also makes sense of some of the 30 Rock scenes.     Thanks Tina for writing this book it was entertaining as much as it was insightful. I hope you sell a zillion copies.    Plus -yay me for being the first to post a review.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|First of all, I love Tina Fey. She's a hardworking woman in a man's world and I think she is someone who is very inspiring to teenage girls like myself. The book was HILARIOUS, but I also felt that it had some empowering bits in it too. How can she take a story about an awful job at a Chicago Y and make it empowering? Beats me, but she certainly did. Tina is true to her own voice. She isn't afraid to take her flaws, acknowledge them, and then run with it. I think that's one of the best things about her and what makes her such an outstanding woman in my eyes. READ THIS BOOK (especially if you're a 17 year old girl). Just do it. Or go and watch some [[ASIN:B000RBA6CO 30 Rock: Season One]]. That's an excellent alternative.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|As a Healer and a Hospice volunteer I found this book phenomenal.  I believe it should be required reading for health care workers.  The insights are priceless. Those reviewers who critiqued the writing really missed the point. I watched the TED.com video and then purchased the CD set and now the paperback. This is a rich cache of information that makes our human life more understandable.  I would also recommend to you \\"The Diving Bell and The Butterfly,\\" both the DVD and the book. Don't critique the writing!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I liked it I thought it had good action and the plot isn't bad. I enjoyed it and like seeing Jolie in action movies, I did thought though that in this movie Salt most of the stunts are like Jolie's movie \\"Wanted\\".<br /><br />Towards the end love the twist was surely not expecting that.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have used a number of GPS devices and all have worked reasonably well, however with the Bushnell Tour V2, I can get an EXACT yardage to a pin or any other object.   There are no downloads to fool with and it's super easy to use. If I can see it, I can tell how far away it is. It's that simple. It's light, comes with a sturdy   protective case and appears to be made quite well. No upgrade needed.
B00025ETIW|5.0|When I first heard of these guys, I decided to give them a listen. So I bought this album, and by the end, I thought: \\"This is the most sporadic, gothic, and crazed-up album I've ever heard.\\" I say that in a good way, of course.  MCR is one of the modern inheritors of concept albums (i take concept albums very seriously), telling the most craziest stories in each album they have released.This album(a story of a outlaw who dies and in order to see his lover again, makes a deal with the devil and must bring 1000 evil souls to hell)is my personal favorite of the band and is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Everything(except the interlude)...even the power ballad \\"The ghost of you\\" is hard hitting and emotional. They are not emo, more of a post-hardcore band with a mix of prog, glam, and metal. Good thing too, otherwise songs like \\"Give 'em hell, kid\\" or \\"I'm not okay\\" wouldn't get off the ground. Futhermore, where would we be without songs like \\"You know what they do to guys in prison\\" or \\"The jetset life is gonna kill you\\" (my personal favs)? Nowhere!!! MCR is THE punk band of the century.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|OMG  this is a amazing total package.<br />everything from the introduction to the disc to the online bonus features has been thought out and excecuted perfectly.<br />the picture quality is amazing (so much so that the stunt doubles are hilariously noticeable) and the sound top notch.<br />if you own T2 on dvd get rid of it and buy it on blu ray instead this is a must own for HD buffs like me<br />and the price holy monkies epic price<br />worth every penny and ever second
B003Y3MYYU|4.0|This is a very good recording of Wagner's Ring. The sound quality is excelent, considering that these are live recordings from Bayreuth Festival in 1966 and 1967. The singers were among the best wagnerians ever: Wolfgang Windgassen, Birgit Nilsson, Theo Adam, James King, etc. Böhm's conducting is very good, as usual, and the Bayreuth orchestra sounds fine. Each CD has a paper envelope to protect it. The booklet, however, is quite simple, with biographical data from Böhm and some singers (not all) and opera's synopses in English, German, and French, but no libretto and no photos.
B004FOA84A|1.0|app force closes on Evo every time.  please update.  glad I tried this while free.  please update.  force closes on Evo every time.  please update.
B004FOA84A|4.0|very.. very short, but a great game none the less. I would have been happier if it was $1. That's only because of how short it is.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Awesome game! Really enjoyable, would love a second part. Graphics are great, the sound is great and spooky. Great story line. Grady job, and thanks for giving it out for free.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great concept for a game. It only took my wife and I a few hours to beat it though. I hope theyakr another one soon, just longer and more challenging.
B004289ZW0|5.0|This product works great.  I read all the reviews. Paid special attention to how everyone was having problems with the on-off switch.  This function works fine.  You just have to know how to operate it.  Yes when I first got it I would rub it and rub it and nothing would happen.  As soon as I figured out were the touch switch was it works perfectly, every time.
0525422943|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I cried of happiness!  This story it's really heartbreaking!  It shows the closure that both need in order to keep going on with their lives or even find themselves again.  The way the author shows the story from Adams's POV was amazing.  Seeing his pain and his feelings towards the girl he loves the most and feeling that empitness was really hard.  It shows the link between tragedy and true love and how those two things can bind them together forever.  Adam struggle to get the meaning to his life after loosing Mia.  She left to pursue her dream and never came back to him.  He tried to get his life back on track and it wasn't easy at all.  He tried to find a girl to fill that empty space in his life but it wasn't good enough.  Music wasn't the same either and it was because of fate that he got his chance to see Mia again and find some answers.  Those answers finally made him understood that she was mad at him for make her stay alive and then he broke his promise.  It's in that closure moment that they finally understod that their love was pure and even though they tried to keep going on those strings were stronger than ever and their destiny was to be together forever.  This sequel for If I stay get us the sense of forgiveness and true love because of all the obstacles they had.  I would definetly read this book again and I recommended to every one!
0920668364|5.0|Our family fell in love with this book when my daughter was small.  It is still her favoite children's book.  We share it with others when they have a new baby.  It touches on the love of a mother for her son or could be any child.  Thanks.
0670022411|5.0|This book is a love story that tells the story of a vampire and witch who want to be together against all odds. I would say this book is the college version of the Twilight series.  If you are looking for a entertaining book for a stormy weekend this won't disappoint.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Wonderfully enchanting.Brilliantly cast, superb performance, SE added a touch of \\"cloud\\" magic. There is romance and a bit of coming of age but not so much that we don't want our children to see. Look up at the sky and dream. Stardust even has a catchy hit song that keeps singing thru the echos of your memory long after the DVD is over.  A good and relaxing movie, we can dream about - forget gas prices, forget taxes, forget maddening wars in other countries just for a movie.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This jams a really good radio app and beats the default radio widget on my HTC Droid Incredible. However I would like to see this app add a widget option to add so you don't have to always open the app. otherwise a super app!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|It's a great fan & heatsink combination, just huge. You had better have a wide case like a Coolermaster HAF if you want a side fan, if you use it in an Antec 900 you'll have to give up the side fan. It will allow overclocking like no other HSF unit I've tried. Add a second fan for push/pull and you will see some significant drops in temps even with a large overclock.
0446563048|5.0|Just an amazing story. After watching \\"The Social Network\\" I left with an incredible sense of motivation. I had the same feeling after reading this book.
B004SQS9FA|4.0|King of Limbs is a grower. Do not write a review within the first 3 listens at least. And listen to it with a good set of headphones, there are many details that are felt best with them.  I understand fans that claim the return of the rock anthems of OKC and The Bends but I believe Radiohead will never return to them in a full album, those masterpieces are from the past century, this is the 21st and music evolves. Also, there is a lot of comparison between KOL and Yorke's and Greenwood's solo albums, I have never listened to them so my opinion of KOL is without expectations; I believe solo albums from any band members are their individual proyects and have little to do with a band's music, at least for comparison purposes.    The first songs that were immediatily digested were Codex, Give up the Ghost and Separator, the last 3 of the album, they have the sound and feels of In Rainbows; Separator is perhaps the only 'sunny' Radiohead song, it ends the album with a positive stand, something that should be welcomed.    KOL begins with Bloom, a sonic tour de force in rythm and abstract electronic layers where melody is not important. Morning Mr. Magpie is another rythm driven piece wih muted guitar and bass ride, my favorite song of KOL. Little by Little sounds like the Old West placed in a futuristic setting or another planet with  menacing guitar and bass lines. Feral is the least essential of the album, an instrumental that reminds of Pull Pulk Revolving Doors in Amnesiac, being the latter the better one.    A comment about duration, at almost 38 minutes it is the shortest Radiohead album to date, just longer than an EP; it was the lenght of most albums before the CD era. Some albums are best this way instead of making them longer with filler.    KOL is a work for serious listening from the dedicated, not casual, fans (the casual must stay away) and shows where Radiohead is headed as they lead the ways of Rock when the second decade of the century starts, it grows ifyou have the patience to analyze all its musical 'charms' and you could be rewarded with ear candy as you reach final destination.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Just wanted to express my utter displeasure for what seems an unfortunate change in the Harry Potter film genre.<br /><br />From magical delightful escape, we are now presented with a harsh monotonous slow story which bores and shocks. What a great pity.
1936719010|5.0|I downloaded the free Kindle version and was so impressed that I bought his \\"The War of Art\\" right away. That's the great thing about free books, both for the reader and for the author.
B000Q66JXA|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and I love it now.  Great to finally have it on blu-ray.  Video and audio quality aren't bad, definitely a step up from the old DVD, but won't be a showcase piece.  Still, it's' the best version of the movie out there.  Great use of several classical music pieces too...LOVE the Carmina Burana in this!!
B004GYY714|5.0|Was a bit skeptical at first, but this app is GREAT!  Took seconds to buffer and all the stations I listen to regularly are in my local list.  It's difficult getting stations in the building where I work, so this makes that now possible.  Thanks for the great app!
B000063DIR|1.0|I have the remastered and my old original Jet Records of Diary.  I just popped in the remastered after not listening to either for to long.  I can't stand it! My Jet is all scratched up but still plays.  Oh, love this CD! Diary is what it is: the time the people the atmosphere the studio, the budget.  This are all parts that make this album great.  Don't F#$& with it, You'll just F^#@ it up!  Also this was an exceptionally F^$%ed up remaster job.  FU
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I recently installed this cooler on an [[ASIN:B004EBUXI0 Intel Core i5 Processor i5-2500 3.3GHz 6MB LGA1155 CPU BOX80623I52500]] in the [[ASIN:B000GQMHBI Antec Three Hundred Gaming Case External 3 X 5.25; Internal 6 X 3.5 2*Usb2.0]] case.  During normal use, the CPU is staying around 20 deg Celsius and only increases by about 10-15 deg during gaming and higher demand processing.  I was a little skeptical it would fit in the case after pulling it out of the box, considering its about 6.5 inches long.  However, it fit great and I agree with other customers that the installation was easy to understand and accomplish.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a reliable and efficient cooler.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Fun game that worked once, then force close after force close after force close after force close. Did I mention it force closes? Too bad really, uninstall. (Samsung Vibrant)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a really cool app and i havn't even used the premium features like the dvr feature.  Im using this with the Evo and it hasnt had a problem keeping it buffered.  Would recomend to others.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This album really ROCKS!! It is mainly a showcase for Christina Aguilera's voice but this album has some really nice songs, and every song is quaranteed to get your feet moving and rear in gear!! A great Album and I am so glad that I purchased this Album!!
0385341008|5.0|This is a book that gets better with age.  Initially, the work feels fluffy.  Main characters try too hard to be witty and urbane.  When mixed with the homespun characters of the island, however, grounding occurs.  The book has a good lesson about judgement - all people are not as they might appear.  There is also a theme of resurrection as the island recovers from a terrible war, a child is raised, the injured are healed, and peace returns.  To make this work, the spirit of a heroic woman must be remembered, repeated, and shared.  Elizabeth, the main character who never appears, is the life force - the primary influence that encourages others to persevere and grow.  As was stated in the final pages, this is not the end (to both the book and the reader's reflection), but the beginning of a wonderful and adventerous life.  Read it!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I no longer need to turn on my laptop to listen to internet radio! This app has every genre of music and radio station imaginable! I can't believe it was free; but I would gladly pay for it if it wasn't. I can't believe I can listen to Czech radio on it!
B004FOA84A|2.0|Beat the game in under an hour...  Only got it because it was offered as a free app...  But it was a good game. Good graphics.
1580084621|4.0|Great collection of receipes for those who want authentic Thai food.  However, if you want quick and easy the forget this one.
B00110K62U|5.0|I saw Les Miserables:  The 10th Anniversary edition on PBS, I cannot tell you how many years ago and loved it then and am enjoying it now and I am sure in the future. It's worth watching over and over again if you like professional singers singing parts about the French Revolution and a man who's life of crime is changed by a gracious Priest.  The orchestra and background singers are excellent as well as all the cast.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|A must of you listen to sports talk radio but not in your region's big city!  98.5 Sports hub rocks!  Hope you grabbed the pro version while free.  Also found patriots.com podcast stream.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|First time I heard this album... didn't find it very good or interesting. I practically thought I had wasted my money getting it on vinyl. I was going to abandon it altogether, but something made me listen to it again. Now, it's one of my favorite records to listen to. It's so good. I've heard a lot of people say it's overrated, but I really think it's useless to numerically rank albums in terms of which ones are objectively the best anyway. Don't let the \\"best album ever\\" classification make your expectations too high in the beginning- you've gotta spend time with this one.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|There are a number of reviews already on this book, but I did really enjoy it and wanted to add my thoughts. As you might guess however, I'm going to compare this book to another I read over 25 years ago. Back then I was involved with this group called the US Navy, and a little known author came out with a book from a little known publisher called 'The Hunt for Red October'.  Similar to thioughs book it was a 'technical' thriller, where the technology in that case revolved around the military.     For that book the technology was the world of submarine warfare.  The book eventually became a huge best-seller, in part because the author really did a great job to take you into the high stakes world of sub-surface warfare. To pull a quote from it's Amazon page: \\"A military thriller so accurate and convincing that the author was rumored to have been debriefed by the White House.\\" There was so much noise related to how this fictional work did a great job of depicting the tension and reality of the world of a submariner, that after a while it's niche appeal attracked a much larger audience making it a popular best seller.    The book \\"Zero Day\\" is for me, the technology community's version of a \\"Hunt for Red October\\".  A good thriller which also does a great job with the technology. Don't be put off by the fact that the book has a technical background, at it's core there is a good plot. The story is well written even without a deep understanding of the technology. As with Red Oct. it should attract a larger audience who learn more via word of mouth and enjoy thrillers. Hearing that this book keeps the technology 'real' without letting it take over the novel is a plus. At no point do you find yourself thinking - no way, we've moved outside anything related to the realm of possibility and into pure science fiction. Not only that but if you pay attention you'll read a good discussion of the risks and reality of technology espionage.    If I were the author I might have left abit of the 'steamy' scenes to Hollwood but that's me.    Finally the book definitely allows for a follow on and hopefully the author will begin outlining and working on that follow-up if he hasn't already.      (BTW, first time I've seen Kindle allow me to submit my rating online and first time I've tweeted from my Kindle... didn't know the thing had it in it.)

0307472841|1.0|I found this book inspiring. The blurb on the jacket hailed the author as the greatest living mystery writer in Sweden. If this is true, to read the book will be to realize that you too could be the greatest living mystery writer in Sweden with apparently little effort.    The plot is leaden and full of holes (a ribbon from a restaurant ends up on the outskirts of a vast crime scene and investigators fall all over themselves to conclude the ribbon must be vital? a concluding letter from the main character, the Swedish judge, that would inevitably draw the son of one of her friends into a British murder investigation?).      But what really rankles is the seemingly infinite, and infinitely shallow, musing on the nature of modern China. It just goes on and on. All you need to know about the author's insight into China is revealed by how he has all his Chinese characters going around bowing to one another, and bowing to Westerners, in the course of their various interactions. Anyone with any familiarity with China knows that since the founding of the PRC, Chinese - pointedly - do not bow to one another in regular day-to-day interactions, and only bow at all on particular occasions (i.e., funerals). The author or the editor could have looked this up on Wikipedia, but this is just a particularly conspicuous example of inattention to detail (another favorite: multiple references to \\"the Nevada desert\\" in sections of the book about the Mountainous and forested Siera Nevada). One senses his familiarity with modern China comes from having seen a couple Charlie Chan movies.    I bought this book in a hurry before a long flight. I hope it remains the worst book I've ever finished.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Nice app. Large choice of stations from all over the world. Also police scanner stations can be heard too. Sound quality is good too. Thanks for the app
068817776X|4.0|I have read many books about the Holocaust - from personal accounts of concentration camp survivors to biographies of Gestapo officers (and everything in between)- I found this woman's story to be both educational and inspirational.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.

B004FOA84A|4.0|This game reminded me a great deal of a old game called 7th guest (of which if the developers of that game get wind of my review I would gladly pay for again if ported to Xoom.).  This game was enjoyable and had decent puzzles.  The big ssue is how quickly you could complete the game.  For $3 maybe it might barely justify the cost.  However I would say for it to truely be great it would need to be as big and complex as 7th Guest was. As a developer you have to keep in mind this game does not have alot of replay value so buyers are looking to get their value out of one run thru.
B004G6009K|5.0|I love that I could separate the disks to pass to my grandchildren depending on the type of device they have for viewing.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It's a fun little game but way too short.  You go from room to room exploring the mansion.  Most rooms have objects/tools to collect such as keys, matches, a wrench, an ice pick, etc...  Some rooms are locked as are some chests, cabinets, etc...  You use the objects/tools you find to gain access to new parts of the mansion, get access to other objects and tools, and solve puzzles that allow you to progress further into the game.  Great game but really, really short.  HTC EVO 4G.
B003INBNXO|2.0|Donnie Yen is superb in Iron Monkey.  Yuen Wo Peng did the martial arts choreography for that film.  When you do a martial arts film the film should be shot so that you see the full bodies of both, or most of the major combatants.  Unfortunately Ip Man has way to many close ups.  A foot kicking a knee is a bore, even if you know whose foot it is.  Chocolate is also brilliantly shot. It's about a Thai girl kickboxer whose moves are incredible, and who does it all herself.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I didn't know what hydraulic fracturing was all about until I watched this documentary.  It informed me of ... once again, corporations are caring for profits while neglecting the health of the environment and everything living near their crude drilling methods. I wouldn't trust those negative reviews unless they live near a fracking site and drink from a personal well everyday.
1423113381|3.0|As a fan of both the Percy Jackson series and The Lost Hero, I was extremely excited to tackle another of Riordan's interesting, funny, and historically accurate explorations of different mythologies.  Unfortunately, the Red Pyramid--while okay--just felt like a rehash of the previous books with similar characters and situations. In some sense, I can appreciate the loyalty (especially with writing)to a formula that has yielded you several best-selling novels and a lucrative career; however, as an adult, books that are already geared towards younger children, have to transcend that simplicity to appeal to a wider range of individuals.  Maybe I'm nitpicking, but books are not Mad Libs, and I should not be able to plausibly replace any of Riordan's previous characters with the characters in the Red Pyramid and have it work.  Even plot points like the trip to The Land of The Dead and (SPOILER) the ending which involves a temporary solution to stop the rise of Apophis, felt like Percy Jackson's trip to the underworld and Percy Jackson's fight with Luke to temporarily stop Kronos and his goal to destroy Mt. Olympus.  To borrow from the Olympians series, relying on similar plot structures may be Riordan's fatal flaw.  If he has insightful editors, maybe we can expect something a little different from his next productions.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game is a great deal of fun. The only downside is that it can be completed relatively quickly. Hopefully more games like this can be released on mobile devices.
B004FOA84A|5.0|If you LOVE Myst, you'll LOVE this game!! This game is easily worth $4.99! I can't wait for the developer to make another game!  Thank You!
B004P02OJ6|5.0|Great Movie.  Actors were sympathetic and believable in their roles.  Condensing three years of trial and appeal into a few minutes, you still felt the anguish and frustration and hopelessness of not being able to prove the wife's innocence.  After the husband's decision was made to try a jailbreak, the desperate tactics begin.  The movie had me rooting for the success of their flight to freedom. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I had the regular version for several months so this was a no brainer to upgrade to the pro version. The audio quality is still excellent, the viarity of radio stations available worldwide is huge.<br /><br />  I live is Florida and enjoy listening the NY Stations.

B00454U1NS|5.0|I might be baised and say i love this album because i love P!NK, but it truely is an amazing buy !!! Espeically since this album comtains all of her greatest hits !!! I knew a majority of them when i bought it, but i fell in love with more songs i never really heard of before !!! I fell in love with her song \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and \\"Don't let me get me\\", the other songs i have already fell in love with before buying this CD !!!
B002UNMW7O|1.0|The first boondock saints was amazing. a well written action with great comedic breaks. I was excited when i heard a second was coming out. All Saints Day was a dissappointment to watch. The main storyline was good but is ruined by the director trying to copy his original movie style. The movie starts off with Rocco speaking a character who died in the first, he only appears in one other part of the movie going on a sensless rant that makes no connection to the movie at all. I feel he should have been cut out since they didn't find good parts to fit him in with or have connor and Murphey speaking to him more. They added a new character to take over Rocco's place as \\"The Funnyman\\" but the character could not come close to the bar set in the first movie. They also tried to replace the detective from the first one which they should not have done. The comedy was slapstick brainless humor like a man getting slapped with meat, the villian wearing headgear or a man in a pink speedo. To make this movie good: 1)cut out the lost characters instead of trying to replace them with a character trying to be identical 2) cut out the brainless humor, since the humor of the first one would be hard to repeat make this movie more serious.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I would be giving this more stars but Rovio has given in to greed. I recently purchased the paid ad free version and learned that the update adds the ads to the paid person, not cool. fortunately I didn't update after reading peoples unhappy reviews and just decided to download the free version and keep my ad free version add free. Shame on you Rovio for biting the hands that fed and made you what you are. NOT COOL :(
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I never right reviews, but I just wanted to give it another 5 star review...  We've been waiting for an album like this from the Foo Fighters since the second.  I think it's even better.
0307472841|2.0|Great opening chapter... set a great pace. Very disappointed though that the author went in a complete different direction. Interesting theories about China and Western points of view of the culture. Not a great thriller as the title and 'Professional' reviews tout.
0553805371|1.0|I expected more from Hawkins--the grand master of physics--than the idea of gravity as the designer of the universe.  It just doesn't do it for me!...it's just a force...it needs an object to act on and do anything, and then you are back to square one:  where did the object come from?  So, he didn't really explain that.  Actually, I think if anyone is afraid that science is going to be overrun by superstitious religion, or conversely that science is overreaching its capacity, I would recommend the 96 page paperback \\"God and Stephen Hawking\\" by Dr. John C Lennox; especially the chapters on science and rationality and the laws of nature.  If we are ever to have a reasonable discussion about science and religion (minus the overheated science wars), Lennox's writings Provide a better background understanding.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I really like Tom Selleck and liked his version of \\"Monty Walsh\\", but you wouldn't remake the masterpiece. It's like the three attempts to remake \\"Stagecoach\\" or \\"True Grit\\", just can't compete with the original. Like Tom, Lee Marvin is all man.

The variety of stations and genres is fantastic in this app ... and I even caught myself getting a little nostalgic, as I was able to tune in to my hometown station :D The free app of the day is a great feature of the app store, and this app is one of the best to-date!!!
0756405890|3.0|While I found this to be a slightly good read, I did finish it after all, I fail to see what all the five star reviews are about. Overall I found it to be a slightly more mature but less interesting version of Harry Potter. The kid is made an orphan by dark magical creatures and makes his way to a school were he gets into mischief, goes on an adventure and saves the day. Sounds pretty familiar right? Overall the writing and the originality that Rothfuss manages to infuse into his world do save the story from complete failure. I will read the next one in the series but not with overwhelming hope to be blown away.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Game is well done historicesque mystery/puzzle game.  My only issue is that it was way too short... it only took me about an hour to solve it all... and that's with playing it on and off during that time.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is what all Android apps should look like; it feels like it came packaged with the phone!  The user interface packs a lot of features yet doesn't feel cramped and looks absolutely stunning.  I love having the ability to stream FREE internet radio stations while driving, in the office, or hanging around the house FROM ONE DEVICE!!  Cancel your satellite radio subscription and get this!

B002TQ3OBU|4.0|As someone who's gotten into Porcupine Tree starting from their later material, I've been delving into their earlier work. It's great stuff, but for my tastes I think the later stuff is better and more unique. Sky Moves Sideways uses a lot more synth in the forefront than their newer work, and is a lot less song driven. Personally I think [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]] is their finest work to date- it's got a wider dynamic and emotional range, better sounding instruments, the genius of Gavin Harrison on drums, and the epic masterpiece \\"Anesthetize\\". Sky Moves Sideways is a great album, but just doesn't reach the heights that they've hit since then. Still, a good listen.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app.. I use this every day...5 stars for me... I am able to get stations from all over the world.. The best radio app out there..
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I stumbled upon this band one day while looking through new available songs on iTunes.  I instantly fell in love with their two singles and for the first time in a long time, I bought the entire album for my collection.  It was money well spent as I easily love 9/12 songs on the album Sigh No More.  At the age of 32, this band has made me believe in the power of music once again.  For that, I would like to thank them.  Buy the entire album and I am confident that you won't be disappointed.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I love adventure games,  and not shooters so video games have been minimal for me for ten years,  (ed: 15 years) . This was fun!  Intuitive and smooth with good cartoon graphics and a Disney like soundtrack.  It's pretty easy and short,  but it's the company's first game I've seen and they left it open to future games.  4 stars because i would've liked to see more plot,  dialogue, and inventory interaction. Im sure future games will have all that though.  Great start!    Also,  crashed once the first time on my OG Droid but then ran great after that.  Killed my battery in 20min after a full night charge.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this was a really enjoyable game. I got it as amazon's free app of the day and I had a lot of fun figuring out the clues. very cool game.
0316056863|5.0|This review will have nothing negative to say about Tina Fey's book. If you're looking for nit-piks, I feel certain you can scroll through other reviews and discover what the book \\"is not\\" (samples: it's not really a memoir and not an autobiography) and \\"does not do\\" (sample: provide a history of nine years of SNL).<br /><br />This is a review about what the book is: It's extremely funny. David Sedaris funny. Steve Martin funny. Erma Bombeck funny.  Anne Lamott funny. If you can connect the dots on that list, you'll know I'm referring to people who are wired to see the world through irony-colored glasses, but who -- along with their editors -- care (or, in Bombeck's case, \\"cared\\") deeply about the selection and cadence of written words and how to translate an audible \\"rimshot\\" into a written dash or ellipses.<br /><br />Speaking of Bombeck, I could go on and on about how Tina Fey is actually Erma Bombeck if Erma Bombeck had been born in 1970 instead of 1927. Anne Lamott was born in 1954 and I could probably do the same with her. Like Lamott, and Bombeck, Fey views the stuff women encounter as rich source material for explaining universal -- even spiritual -- truths. And by \\"universal,\\" I mean \\"not just truths about women for just women.\\"<br /><br />However, the real reason I love this book is because it's the first book I've read that belongs in a new business-book-niche-category for \\"accidental entrepreneurs\\" or \\"accidental bosses.\\" These are people who are just so gifted and good at what they do - and love it so much, they don't think it's beneath them to take on the crappy stuff when they're first starting out. Soon, when the people who felt it was beneath them to take on the crappy stuff have moved back home with their parents, people like Tina Fey is head writer for Saturday Night Live. (I hope that wasn't too much of a spoiler.)<br /><br />While not marketed as a business book (Tina Fey did not write it to convince convention planners to book her as a keynote speaker) it is actually a very funny business book for people who think they may be accidental bosses, but who are really natural bosses who aren't encumbered by having gone to business school to learn how to be a professional boss.<br /><br />It's also an affirming business book that says, \\"get over it\\" about too many things to list in a review like this.<br /><br />Also -- and I swear this -- I've probably watched every episode of Tina Fey's SNL era and 30 Rock, but until reading this book, I never noticed she had a scar on her face. (Oops. Another spoiler.)unny business book for people who think they may be accidental bosses, but who are really natural bosses who aren't encumbered by having gone to business school to learn how to be a professional boss.

B00012BSHG|4.0|We put up up the pool a couple of weeks ago for the first time and yes , while it is disappointing that it doesn't have a drain plug and you need to deflate the whole thing in order to let the water and then inflate it again, it is a neat pool. It's big, my 4 year old has plenty of room in it, i can even sit in it and my child still has enough room to play and 'swim' in it. I love that it higher then most other kiddie pools and that the bottom is inflatable.  All in all , i give this pool 4 stars only because it would be perfect if it had a drain plug on the bottom.
3937406328|5.0|It's too bad for all of us that it took a grave illness for Chris Rea to work on his most ambitious projects of his life.  This set alone would be a career for most artists.  Eleven differently themed music discs and a DVD documentary on the 12th disc!  Rea takes a genre such as Chicago Blues and imagines himself in that place and time and writes original material reminiscent of that genre.  And he pulls it off eleven times!  The set comes housed in a beutiful hard-bound book laced with reproductions of his own paintings.  You think the guy could spread some of his talent around!  It is one of the best bargains for the money to be found anywhere by anybody!  Buy it...it may not be around forever!
B003UYUQZW|3.0|Definitely geared toward the teenager set. Very good visuals, cg, scenery, and costuming. Mediocre on acting and script. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it is spite of its faults. Probably a strong 3.5 for me.
1573228737|4.0|A few weeks ago I shared my thoughts on the first half of this book here. I was enjoying the atmosphere that the author created, I found the main character intriguing, and was very interested in seeing where the story was going to go next. And I'm going to admit that I went into the book with high expectations after hearing all of the accolades concerning the author and her novels. I'm happy to share that this book lived up to all of my expectations, and I found this to be a wonderful reading experience. My favorite part of this book was the gloomy, creepy atmosphere that the author creates. The prison, where a huge part of the story takes place, seems to take on a life of its' own and I couldn't help but wonder at the mysteries and horrors that it held within its' walls. Margaret was such a curious and mysterious main character. I never could guess what she was going to do throughout the story and found her actions to be surprising at times. And Selina. I constantly wondered about her \\"spiritualism\\" and if anything that she was saying was true or how could it possibly not be true. The whole book was a mystery for me until the very end. The ending of the book blew me away...and yet when I thought about it afterwards it wasn't all that unexpected but it sure worked. It was the type of ending that left me thinking about it for a couple of days afterwards if that tells you anything :) All in all, this is a book that I would highly recommend and an author that I will be reading much more of.<br /><br />Disclosure: I checked this book out from my local library but I'm thinking about buying my own copy as I enjoyed this one so much. Thanks to Andi for hosting this readalong and finally giving me the push to give this author a try!

B0000DBJDM|1.0|I just finished watching the Director's Cut. I have been a lifelong Floyd fan and adored my VHS copy of the original Live at Pompeii. I lost my copy years ago and have been wanting to replace it for some time now. I wanted to buy the original on DVD, but this is all I have been able to find. I was wary of it due to others' reviews being so poor. I didn't want a doctored version or to put my money into encouraging the changing of a masterpiece. So, I borrowed it from our local library, unwilling to shell out four times as much as what I had paid for it on VHS in the 1990s. Unfortunately, the disc I borrowed had a scratch on it, so I was unable to watch the original concert in it's entirety. I went to the scene selection menu to try and skip over the scratched area of the disc. The disc menu only allows you to choose from the Director's cut versions of the song., which I was avoiding like the plague. So, I was forced to watch the Director's version or none at all. I was horrified at how poor the Director's cut was. I am saddened by the computer graphics. Terrible terrible terrible. Shame on them for messing with a such a good thing. I couldn't even finish watching it. Boo!
0393976041|4.0|great book, I highly recommend it. It has footnotes for an easy read and lots of information on the author in the last pages of the book.
0817439390|5.0|I am a beginning DSLR user.  To get started, my first priority was to understand how to use the menus, buttons, dials and custom function settings on my camera.  My second priority was to understand some basic techniques to achieve good enough results.  I now have a third priority, which is to understand how to use the exposure setting modes (P, Av, Tv, M, B).  Understanding exposure prioritizes what really matters when creating an exposure and gives very specific guidance on setting the camera to achieve the correct creative exposure.  If I can master understanding exposure, I will have achieved my third priority, which is essentially to take outstanding exposures while allowing the camera to just get out of the way and fade to the background.  This book has added to my excitement of photography and I look forward to those special moments when I get to sit back and enjoy amazing memories throughout my life.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|Redford's  star-studded take on Gregory Bernstein & James Solomon's story (and screenplay) surrounding the true-story of the female conspirator of the Lincoln Assassination. The mother of John Surratt, the conspirator at large, is trialled, in part to bring (john) Surratt out of hiding. An impressive job here, by Redford, in making an historical footnote Mary Surratt into an interesting if possibly noble character!  But much of the movie depends on James McAvoy's emotion portrayal of Union-vet/war-hero  and neophyte lawyer Frederick Aiken, who defended the sole female conspirator  after Wilkes Booth was shot.<br /><br />The film also follows the historical strand of Kevin Kline as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton who while running the government immediately following The assassination is overly eager to have an execution(s) and be done with the whole affair. Great old-school period drama with Robin Wright,  Evan Rachel Wood, Tom Wilkinson, Justin Long, Danny Huston, Norman Reedus, Colm Meaney (great to see Colm again!).
B004DMIIO6|5.0|Goemon a body guard to a princess turned thief after his lord Oda Nobunagas assassination chooses freedom over service but freedom as we know  comes with price. Stealing from the rich and corrupt and giving to the poor. during one of his heists he comes across a mysterious box that could unravel a deadly conspiracy and tear Japan apart at the seams into a another civil war can Goemon put a stop to this chaos or will he be torn apart with it?  A beautifully done film with amazing special effects through green screen which most of the film is done in with plenty of emotional impact and crazy over the top action.I was truly impressed with this film on all levels and enjoyed it the beautiful done cgi scenery, the great action scenes through out the film especially at the last 30 or so minutes of which is pure totally unrealistic but awesome action where he takes on hordes of enemies to enact revenge  for a loss of a friend and save Japan from yet another civil war and finally bring peace to a war torn land.  I highly recommend this film but if you have doubts about it then i would recommend renting it first. But if you like Japanese action films  with some history put in although changed for dramatic effect or if you simply like action films i say buy it, i did and it was truly worth it.     With my respect Thanks for reading my review  I hope it was helpful.
0316056863|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Tina Fey is hilarious and she's right on the pulse of today's culture and issues.  The book is more vignettes than chronological memoir.  I thought this was fine until the last third of the book.  It fell apart at the end a bit for me and I think she could have used some choice editing advice to pull it together and end strong.    But all in all, I enjoyed the hell out this book.  Lots of laugh out loud passages, and I enjoyed her reminiscences of the past, especially about her high school summer theater experiences and the beautiful chapter about her Dad.    There are some great rules about improvisation and life lessons about how to move forward as a woman, or really anyone, in business, e.g. if someone is getting on your nerves and you're tempted to strike back, think, \\"Is this person in between me and what I want?\\"  If not, stay your path and place your energies moving forward.  Rock on, Tina.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|A few years ago, I watched the documentary \\"The Smartest Guys In The Room,\\" about how Enron systematically duped the system, employees and the public into believing their fraudulent practices were a legitimate business. In 2005, they went from the USA's seventh largest company to bankruptcy, leaving a trail of death, debt and broke employees while the principles scooted away with the bulk of their fortunes. It was revealing to watch how they cozied up to presidents, regulators, and essentially eliminated anyone that caught on to the giant ponzi scheme the company was. I watched and wondered, how did they get away with this, and could we stop it from ever happening again. The Oscar Winning \\"Inside Job\\" answers that creeps like Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were only the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" takes an in-depth look at how, starting with Reagan and continuing with President Obama, the financial pirates of Wall Street bought their way into massive paper fortunes, played the markets like parlor games and then got the world to buy them free passes when the house of cards came down. Narrated by Matt Damon, featuring plenty of interviews by several key government players, including Elliott Spitzer and Barney Frank (who, the film does NOT mention, voted for the \\"Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000\\", which is a key bill in the slippery slope). Several of the key Government types get sudden convenient cases of memory loss when pressed for certain details that they were intricately involved in (see the financial lobbyist who gives his Wall Street masters a 'B' grade for their handling of the collapse), and how major ratings firms suddenly turn their respected viewpoints of Triple A commodities ratings for companies on the verge of collapes into \\"it's just an opinion.\\"<br /><br />Nobody, left or right, gets out unscathed. Reagan gets first whacks for elimination of regulatory agencies, put in Alan Greenspan as his ideological watch-dog, and opened the world up to Savings and Loans. It took about nine years for them to collapse (under Bush One), so Wall Street had to come up with something new. That became derivatives, which Clinton legalized despite strong strong objections (and the person objecting is told firmly to keep her mouth shut) under Graham/Leach in '99 and effectively repealing the Glass-Steagall act from The Depression. With all the regulatory firewalls removed, banks could now effectively make a poorly advised loan, bundle it to a whole bunch of risky loans, sell this to someone else, then that group could sell it up the chain, with the complicity of the bonding agencies that gave these ticking time bombs triple A ratings.<br /><br />When it comes to deregulating, though, nobody did it better than Bush the second. In 2004, he got the Securities and Exchange Commission to drop regulations against predatory lending, unleashing a new wave of subprime lending to the poor even if it was obvious that the loans wouldn't be repayable. Just bundle it into securities/assets, sell it and the risk belonged to someone else. By 2004, banks could leverage funds beyond their wildest dreams, so they did; some up to 33 times their available cash. Then came the biggest hit of all, the watchdog arm of the SEC was cut to a single employee. In an industry that has 5 lobbyists for each elected official, there was only one person left to investigate wrong doing.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" also tackles the thorny issue of morality; when is too much not enough? Banks began to figure out that these bundled securities weren't going to be able to withstand the market much longer, they insured themselves against their failure then sold them even harder to drive the profits up before the explosion. They could profit now, success or failure, and things began to resemble a competition. Who has the most jets? Who has the most houses? Who has a private elevator that no-one else can use? So when the explosion came, starting with Bear Stearns in Spring 2007, the bankers had already covered their own behinds. And again, thanks to Bush Two, when the bankers realized the house of cards was about to enter meltdown, when they came crying to the government with their hands out, AIG and Goldman Sachs got 100 cents on the dollar. No risk, all reward.<br /><br />President Obama fairs little better. He is criticized for putting the same old robber-barons in place (Tim Geithner, Larry Summers) and not pushing for tougher regulations post-crash. Even scarier is how these old hands are now advisers to business schools AND financial groups, which means the same flawed rules they played by to create this septic situation are being bought and paid for by financial institutions and taught and sold for by educational institutions. That is what is so maddening and ultimately depressing bout \\"Inside Job.\\" While Enron (and folks like Bernie Madoff, Bernard Ebbers (MCI), Allen Stanford and his ilk) give you a convenient and singular target, \\"Inside Job\\" shows just how spread the dominoes are, and just how eager most of the players are to reset the table just as it was before.had already covered their own behinds.

B004O86JZ4|4.0|Wasting Light does not mince words - it's punchy, crisp, and feels like an amalgamation of everything they've done in the past. It features rockers, ballads, and even the grunge-metal of their self-titled debut, all packed onto one disc. You could consider it a primer for all things Foo, and in an odd way it even makes a better \\"greatest hits\\" than their actual Greatest Hits.    The album's strongest quality is that familiarity - the Foo Fighters always sound like themselves, and they'll never throw you for a loop. Some may fight me over this actually being a bad thing, but it actually makes them one of the most reliable rock bands around these days. And while Wasting Light fits that bill perfectly - familiarly Foo - something about it feels re-energized. Maybe it was their hiatus, or recording the album in a garage, or even the reunion with Butch Vig, Pat Smear, and Krist Novoselic. But whatever it is, the album packs a wallop and a consistency that hasn't been seen since The Colour and the Shape. \\"Bridge Burning\\" is energetic, heavy, and catchy, \\"Arlandria\\" starts off with a riff that could've been on Them Crooked Vultures' album, and \\"These Days\\" has Grohl spitting venom. A few tracks near the end blend together and are fairly forgettable (\\"A Matter of Time\\", \\"Miss the Misery\\"), but even then, they're not bad. Which is something I've thought about the Foos for a long time now - even at their worst, they're still the best.
B004XONUEW|5.0|Just when you think you're out of laughs, Sam Colt delivers one more.  From the moment Dean says he wants to Star Trek 4 this dude, the fun starts and doesn't stop until he \\"ganks\\" him.  Jensen shows that he's got some great comedic timing, Sam gets that frame on a horse (don't you wish Dan Blocker's horse was still around?) and Bobby undergoes a soulonoscopy.  More fun than the airplane episode which is still one of my favorites.
0060557818|4.0|I have been looking forward to reading Neverwhere for some time. I finally picked up a copy at a used bookstore and settled on reading it; Neverwhere did not disappoint. The first few pages went by effortlessly as Gaiman drew me in by sympathizing with the somewhat boring a predictable life of Richard Mayhew. As soon as a half bloodied up young girl is found crumpled before him on the pavement, Richard's whole life changes. Gaiman takes you on an adventure in London below where he uses the Underground tube map to guide you around the stations you once thought you knew...I couldn't put Neverwhere down each time I picked it up. Several hours easily went by as I consumed this book rapidly. I strongly recommend it. It will leave you smiling at the end.

B0012CJQY6|5.0|This season includes the Pilot for the series and got me hooked on this TV show; even though it was made for TV it is so UNLIKE any TV series in many ways. Each episode introduces characters you grow to like, then dislike or just get ambivalent about, too. It leaves you hoping there will be another season.
B004G600A4|5.0|Before I saw the movie, I was lukewarm about this latest Disney princess offering. The main reason for my lack of enthusiasm was the trailer I saw over and over again.  The movie seemed like a zany spoof of an actual princess story. As it turns out,  about 90% of the scenes in the trailor aren't even in the movie.   My 5 year old wanted to see Tangled and I took her on the opening weekend thinking it would be mildly entertaining but ultimately disappointing. I was thrilled to discover that Rapunzel is an enchanting film. I completely fell in love with this sincere, thoughtful well done movie. Visually beautiful, wonderful soundtrack, great acting..I could go on and on about this movie.  My daughter and I  went back and saw it in the theater again a few weeks later. We've watched it repeatedly since we got the DVD. In my humble opinion, Tangled is the best princess movie since Beauty and the Beast.   I don't know what Disney was thinking when it wrote up the marketing plan for this film. Not only does it completely misrepresent this nature of this film, it does it a HUGE disservice.
0316056863|3.0|Good book overall though I had higher hopes. I'm a huge Tina Fey fan and hold a lot of the same beliefs about work, life, politics, etc. However, this book is not done yet. It somehow missed a final edit. There are wonderful insights and slices of her life that are quite humorous. Though the book wanders aimlessly without direction in many spots.  Way, way too much talk about fecal matter which is not funny -- I thought Tina was smarter than that.  It's a light read though perhaps you'll enjoy it more if you borrow it from a friend as opposed to shelling out the cash yourself.
B004G600A4|5.0|Like some other reviewers on here, I didn't care if I saw this movie.....I was turned off by the trailer. I was talked into viewing this film by a friend, and I'm glad I was. What a surprise!!! I'm an older \\"Kid\\", but I loved this movie, and wonder who is in charge of marketing for Disney? They should be fired!!! The only thing I didn't like about this film is the title, but that's really a small complaint. The music is great, the comedy is funny and witty, and the story is sweet! I also think this is the first time, in my memory, that the two main characters in a Disney animated film,(Rapunzel and Flynn) are scripted as 3 dimensional characters. And I don't mean the film process!  See this and ENJOY.

B004S699LI|4.0|I may not be a hi-def purist, but I thought for the price ($10 at Best Buy) this wasn't all that bad for a blu-ray disc.  No bonus features added (which I wouldn't watch anyway) but to my eyes and equipment this was a decent looking and sounding blu-ray.  There are moments when the picture isn't the epitome of high deginition, but these take place in the dark shots of the bar and I would think a good deal of remastering would have to take place to make anything in those shots perfection. Is it really supposed to be?  It was shot on film, not digitally.  It has a fine film appearance to me.  Daylight shots are pretty sharp hi-def in my opinion.  Its definitely a step up from the DVD releases of this disc.  If you're happy with those, you might not take the plunge for the blu-ray.  But if you haven't those, this isn't a terrible place to start at all.

B00000ITOY|5.0|This geometric sorter is an excellent toy!  One of the most wonderful things about this toy is that it is open-ended toy.  My son plays with it daily; he likes to stack the pieces on the board or he'll take the pieces and play fill & spill with an empty container.  When we first got the toy for him when he was 14 months old, he had trouble placing the pieces in the correct spot but now after a couple of months his sorting skills have improved greatly. This sorter is a great visual for introducing basic math skills, shapes and colors. The rubber wood used by Plan Toys is very smooth and has yet to splinter or crack (my son has thrown the pieces on tile floor many times with no damage). Some of the paint has transferred off onto some of the other pieces (mainly the blue, red, and green to the yellow) but not onto other surfaces. This toy is a great purchase; well made, durable and eco-friendly!

1408803011|3.0|When I looked for this book, I wanted a hardback copy. I found this listed under such copies and at a reasonable price so I ordered it. I received it within the said time, but when it arrived, it was paperback, not hardback like categorized. That's is the main thing I am disappointed in, but other than that, the book is good. I suggest the seller advertise this book correctly next time under \\"paperback\\" so people don't expect a longer-lasting hardback book in the place of a flimsy, bendable book.

0307276902|3.0|I found this book very readable. This book should have been presented as a work of fiction and that is how I will review it. Its not a perfect piece of fiction. Too many things are too far fetched even for fiction. The corny part about James being adopted by the Godfather character is a bit over the top. But despite many flaws, the book is not boring and is a good read. I do understand why many were upset because the book tries to promote this idea that a person can just will himself to not use drugs and that they don't need a program. Perhaps that is true but Frey is in no position to promote that argument as his story is without a doubt mostly fiction. Many had accepted Frey as an expert from his own experience. But really I have to wonder who could have ever read this book and taken it as non-fiction. There are just too many elements of a crafted novel. One thing that bothered me and I found a bit of a desperation on the part of Frey is his desire to put a higher meaning into his book. He talks about things ringing true. He rejects mainstream religion. I have no problem with that but his need to talk about TAO and nonsense philosophy as \\"RINGING TRUE\\" made me think the main character was really a bit weak minded and that Frey couldn't come up with a better higher purpose than this nonsense. I'm sure this was thought out to give the story a higher meaning but I found it a bit desperate and did not at all ring true. All in all thogh the book really is a pretty good piece of fiction and will keep you entertained.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Fantastic, hilarious book. However, in several spots, there's an asterisk leading to a side joke in a footnote. Instead of displaying the footnotes near the asterisks (which doesn't seem too hard--just tie it to a Location in the book), all the footnotes are displayed at the very end, completely divorced from the joke's setup. Reading the footnotes after finishing the book was annoying. I hope that the publisher gets their act together for Kindle editions in the future. If they can get it right in the print copy, they should be able to get it right in the eBook.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|This movie is a stripped down version of Resistance Fall of Man + Black Hawk Down + District 9.  The Prawns from District 9 come back to take all the food from our cats.  They bring the Angels borrowed from the Chimeran this time.  Angels means trouble!  The retiring solder is being pulled back for duty.  And you know the rest.    I think this is an ok movie if you don't ask for too much drama.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|i think this was a great movie . . . Miley cyrus does an amaing job & although it doesnt get to deep into the plot its still amazing, I mean what do you expect its a PG rated movie. i think this was a hit. The book was also amazing. Even though they are not exactly the same i like it. i mean then it would be really predictable ! Miley did a great job & i cant wait to see more of her work (: have a great day & thanks for reading my review :D

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Name of the Wind is not a perfect book, but it may well be the closest thing I have read in a long time. The only negative things that can be said are that perhaps some would have preferred a quicker moving story, with Kvothe moving more quickly, However patience here is well rewarded. The book is simply a masterpiece. With brilliantly fluid prose and a great realistic main character, mystery, love, magic, and art, the book is not only the best first novel that I have ever read, it may easily be named amongst the titans of fantasy literature.
1423101499|5.0|I really loved this fourth installment in the Percy Jackson series!  It was interesting and informative (something I always appreciate from Riordan - not only the mythology research he must have done, but current research about the country and landmarks).      I definitely felt like Percy was growing up in this book and felt the flavor of the book matched that - a little more detailed and a little less clear on those 'black-and-white' lines.  Things are still building for the \\"finale\\" and I'm really curious how Riordan will tie everything up.  I also quite enjoyed the characters in this book, and the new places that Percy visits.    For me, personally, I do feel the book should have been/was meant to be just a little longer.  I felt there were times when there could have been some great character exploration but that it got glossed over.  Again, this didn't hurt the book, but I would have liked to see just a little more (again though, this could just be a personal thing).  Other than that, this book is a very quick read and exciting the entire time.  Yay Percy!! :D

B000022TSY|5.0|To review this as just a drug dealing action movie is to do it a disservice because I see it as much more than just that.If you've ever read and enjoyed Huckleberry Finn by Twain or On the Road by Kerouac or even to some extent Fear and Loathing by Thompson this movie may be for you.Sure it's drug fueled to some extent but really it's about the journey  we call life.With all the twists and turns that life represents some good some bad some melancholy some adrenaline fueled but above all of this is the journey just like the river in Huckleberry or the road in On the Road weather it be down a river or across country it's really just the journey that we call life.Add to this story some great actors great songs and great scenery and you have Easy Rider so just sit back and enjoy the journey
0316056863|4.0|The only reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it's not as good as Oedipus at Colonnus.  Of course, it doesn't have to be.  Reviewers have concentrated on Fey's discussion of women, but to me she's equally good on the dark and seedy parts of the male psyche, especially those of male comedy writers.  If 30 Rock weren't enough to demonstrate her years of expertise in this area, this book should.  Also, it's funny -- maybe not P. G. Wodehouse or Woody Allen funny -- but really funny.  I'm not sure whether I would reread this book five years later, but it was fun twice through.  Humor's a pretty fragile thing anyway.  It's hard to find.  Writing a joke demands the concentration (and the inspiration) of writing a poem.  Humor professionals awe me.  Fey has been turning out humor for years in high-pressure situations and has come through it all brilliantly.  To give you some idea of how well she's done, her writing has appeared (excerpts from the book) in The New Yorker, a magazine more or less unimpressed with mere celebrity.  Recommended.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I played the game with my 8 and 6 year old sons. They loved it. They were going at it solving the puzzles, collecting clues and exploring. It was a great game to play all together and was a great bonding time. The three of us finished the game in about 2 hours. It is a fast game. For adults, most of the puzzles are going to be quite easy. I'd say there are about 3 that are difficult to solve (the colors on the globe, the birds and the clock). It played fine on my Nexus 1 and my rooted Nook with CM7. I also tested on my G1 and it plays but did shut down a few times and could not successfully get the clock to register the right time (the game wouldn't recognize the correct setting). The biggest negative is that it is 16mb and does not install natively to SD card. If you have a rooted phone that can override and install to SD regardless, that works. But on a phone like the stock Nexus one, I don't have long term memory to spare 16mb. And truthfully, there's no reason not to install this to SD. It's big and it works perfectly fine. Hopefully devs read those reviews noting this and make that quick change.
B003UESJIS|1.0|I don't know what movie everyone else is watching, but Another Year is a self-indulgent mess. It takes an hour and a half to go absolutely nowhere, and features an array of characters, none of whom are likable in the slightest. I saw a lot of movies last year, and this was absolutely the worst one.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|This is a film that will mean nostalgia for the people of my generation, but it is a perfect example in political and working class history if one is needed for those who are in the field every day. The subject itself is an example of historical courage: sex equality as it was called in those days of early fighting for it. We would say today pay equality, gender equality, equality at the work place and on the labor market. But it is the same and that fight in 1968 was an avant-garde fight in the whole world, and it was in England in an American factory, Ford.<br /><br />187 women employed in one Ford factory in England decide to go on strike for equal pay and at once hypocrisy, at least, is revealed among most people. Management takes it with condescendence and sexism. These strikers are just women. Then they take it in the worst egotistic way possible: it is not the case of 187 women that is considered but the fate of millions of women who are going to ask the same if these 187 women get it. And they will try to blackmail the Labor government of Great Britain to get their way.<br /><br />But the second strong point of these women is that in spite of some rebuttal from the sexist bigots, they are supported by men in spite of the hardships it represents since management decides to lock out the workers within forty-eight hours. Men will support in spite of the suffering of their families and children. It is this support that these women will get from the congress of their national union, two thirds against one. The bigots are not isolated but they are clearly defeated.<br /><br />The main point of these women is that they fight for a new right that is for everyone in the end, and not to defend an advantage of some that turns out to be a privilege. In 1968 it was a fair period when new rights were conquered for everyone. We were far ahead of a more recent period when in front of an extremely hard financial crisis some minorities refuse to be realistic and defend their tremendous advantages when millions don't even have one half, when they are not plainly made redundant, of what these privileged people have, like a thirteenth month or even a fourteenth month of salary, the right to retire at fifty or fifty two and so many other unequal advantages.<br /><br />In 1968 equality and justice were fundamental objectives in life provided it was for everyone. History was not made by this or that politician or union leader, not even by this or that minority of fighters. History was made by the general agreement on an objective of justice and equality, and then there is always one man or woman politician who will see his or her career advantage in supporting that objective and the law will go through.<br /><br />That film should make us think of and ponder on the proper attitude we have to defend in a crisis period or in an expansion period in a globalized context. It is so easy to get into some selfish and self-centered defense of one's privileges instead of the general interest, like that of women.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUwhen millions don't even have one half, when they are not plainly made redundant, of what these privileged people have, like a thirteenth month or even a fourteenth month of salary, the right to retire at fifty or fifty two and so many other unequal advantages.

B000FDEU12|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's, and I own literally thousands of jazz, classical and rock discs.  I counted FIVE songs on Continuo which I have rated with 5 stars (maximum) so far:  Smash, Continuo, Arava, Calm, and Ani Maamin.  In addition, I have given 4-star ratings to Nu Nu, Samuel, and Emotional Storm.  And the more I listen to this disc, the more I like it, so those ratings will be going up.  I feel sorry for the reviewer who gave this disc only 1 star.  His limited taste is robbing him of the ability to enjoy some excellent music on this disc.  And to Avishai Cohen, I say \\"keep up the great work!\\"

So, I settled into my favorite Snoogie & enjoyed the harrowing story unfolding before me. The sense of tension & anxiety necessary in any zombie story is prevalent & the empathy as well. The makeup & special effects were excellent, especially by tv standards, as well as the acting. I'm looking forward to seeing how the next season plays out. Mr. Darabont, Mr. Kirkman, more carnivorous unicorns please.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I only started watching this show a few months ago but quickly became hooked. Soon, my weekends turned into Breaking Bad marathons to catch up to the new episodes being aired.    I'm giving Season 3 five stars even though I did find it weaker than the two previous seasons. The strength of the series has always been the relationship between Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Jessie (Aaron Paul). In season 3, their relationship is strained and the lack of scenes between the two strong actors early in the season diminished the season somewhat for me. Fortunately, the latter half of the season was much better as the characters are thrown in together once more. Season 3 finale contains a dramatic cliff hanger which has me excited for Season 4 to start!    Breaking Bad continues to be one of the top dramas on television today with great story lines, strong acting and excellent writing. Highly recommend this series.
B000RO8T7K|5.0|I want to offer my profound gratitude to the two previous reviewers, for it was on the basis of their recommendations that I purchased this outstanding CD set. I specifically sought a piano version rather than harpsichord. With all due respect for the period instrument perspective, I admit to preferring the full, gorgeous sound of the piano over the tinny noise clanging away in the background, and these two musicians so beautifully make use of the piano's equality with the violin. The music sparkles with aliveness, all the parts so clear, Bach's genius on full display. Here we have two instruments truly playing together, with incredible coherence, vitality, sensitivity, joy and depth of interpretation. I previously owned the Gould/Laredo version of the Violin Sonatas which I enjoyed for many years, but Zimmermann and Pace go to a whole new musical dimension. Theirs is an unpretentious, respectful and genuine approach to the music. Beautifully engineered sound too (I listened to the music samples from the French Amazon site as one of the reviewers suggested; the sound quality there was not that good, but I decided to buy the set anyway, hoping the CDs would sound better. Indeed, the sound on the CDs is rich, warm, clear, with no distortion whatsoever. On some of the tracks there is a slight extraneous noise, like the sound of deep breathing, or of a sleeve brushing against clothing. But this performance is so sublime that one hardly notices.)

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I too felt totally rooked by the DVD of Deathly Hallows part one but I have since found out (through Mugglenet.com) that if you go to Wal-Mart, they have a 2 disc special edition DVD. It is $19.--something and it has all the special features the combo pack has except the opening scene for DH part II which I don't find that big of a deal because the movie is coming out soon and the fact that you can get it in the combo pack means that there is a pretty good chance that it can be found on youtube or on the Harry Potter Facebook page.  So to all you people peeved by the DVD I say again go to Wal-mart. I did so last night and watched all the special features and the movie (the quality of the movie is even better--I don't know what WB is playing at).  I feel much better.  Also I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I found out that for people with blu-ray they had to get the combo pack in order to see the special features. If they bought just the blu-ray edition not the combo pack all you get for special features is the delete/additional scenes (just like if you got just the DVD).  Why would WB do something like that?--I am naive I guess.

B004IFYN2E|5.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable film!  Excellent acting, solid writing.  I doubt people will be drawn to see this solely for the scenery and cinematography, but those elements certainly add to the charm of the movie.  My mom and I saw it at the theater and were totally immersed in the story.  I thought it was hilarious that my mom was completely surprised by the ending, but even if you see it coming (which I admit I didn't until toward the end) it was an enthralling journey to get there.  What a treat to see such a beautiful and engaging film.  Can't wait to see this clever movie again, although it won't be the same as the first time through.
B0042RUMJG|3.0|The disc is beautiful, both in look and in orchestration, but many times the vocals and primary instruments are marred by analogue clipping.  I hear it in Sting's voice, in the wind instruments, and oddly enough when they add an audience track.  For a performance where so many people so obviously poured in their best, this seems an amateurish mistake.  For Sting fans, this shouldn't be a problem.  For an audiophile who values a recording as much as the performance, it's a bit disappointing.  Please note that the issue is present in both stereo and 5.1 tracks.  Addendum: I've tested this on multiple systems, using digital outputs straight into the receiver.  Even without any room correction or equalization, the clipping is still there, regardless of amplification levels.  This is very definitely in the disc, and is worst on the brass in &#34;Russians&#34;.

Update- After only a few months of use at about 3-4 times a week they broke. I pulled them off my head and they broke off at the joint where they fold. I expected much more from a set of headphones by Marshall. Don't waste your money. $100 down the drain.
0393324818|5.0|As a sports fan, reading Moneyball allows insights into the often mysterious, but always interesting world of scouting and front office intrigue.  But, the lesson in Moneyball isn't the Oakland A's, Billy Beane, sabermetrics, OPS or any of the elements that regularly are discussed in popular press, and that have now permeated every fantasy leauge.  No, the true lesson of Moneyball - the reason why everyone - including non-sports fans - shoudl read the book - is that it challenges and then dismantles the \\"we've always done it that way\\" approach to decision making, and shows that thorough analysis, data, quantitative tools and questioning the status quo, results can be significantly improved, and that often tradition and conventional wisdom is a poor substitute in decisionmaking for facts and data.<br /><br />Michael Lewis is a very solid author, with a down-home storytelling approach to his writing.  It is a very entertaining and approachable read.<br /><br />Read it if you are a sports fan, read it if you are a traditionalist, read it and see for yourself the transforming component that analysis brings to decisionmaking.

I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.  The movie is a story about Ryan's character Mary Haines.  Mary's husband is cheating on her with the \\"spritzer girl\\" at Saks.  Mary's friends find out and try to find a way to tell Mary, but she already knows.  We watch Mary fall apart and then pull it all back together.<br /><br />There's a part in the film where Mary has now gained her confidence back and she realizes that she wants to accomplish some things on her own merit.  She has renewed vigor about life.  Her mother asks her what brought about these changes.  Mary replies, \\"Hitting bottom.  Having nothing else to lose.  I highly recommend it.\\"<br /><br />I loved that quote.  Its inspiring for anyone that is feeling like she has hit bottom and for all of those who have pulled themselves out of that valley.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic.  There, seriously, is no bad song on the album.  Just when everyone keeps saying rock is dead, the Foos show us that it's alive and punching, kicking, screaming, and biting.  The Foos might be the only rock band left actually playing rock, but I'm hoping this album inspires other bands to do the same; I'm so tired of the banal, bubble gum, auto-tuned music out there.    As others have mentioned, the Foo Fighters pretty much have two different stages in their career.  The classic in their first stage is Colour and Shape, while their second stage pretty much just started.  I think, personally, that this is their best album to date.  There's no doubt that \\"Wasting Light\\" is a classic and it's going to be interesting to see what they follow this up with. I can't wait!

1416549447|5.0|This is a great book that may change your running for ever for the better. Very well written and easy to understand. If you read about POSE running which has more scientific explanation about the correct form of running, essentially says the same as this book does. Forget about heel strike and lift off with your toes. Learn how to run with mid-foot strike under your body (not in front) and lean forward (which will work as your gas pedal as you are taking advantage of the gravity) without bending at your waist. It is like controlled fall. You will find you are spending less energy and your risk of injury is less as well.
0756404738|2.0|This book was well written, but unfortunately the plot leaves something to be desired. After Name of the Wind, I came into this expecting a lot - I feel like I was let down in many ways.    The book felt like a disconnected mish-mash with no clear goal. It takes place in four major distinct settings, but for all that, manages to feel empty and lifeless. Heavy reuse of settings in the previous book make parts of the book mundane.    The protagonist Kvothe is still terribly interesting, but many sections are such a slog to get through -e.g. the University at the start- that some of the characters lose a lot of luster on the way. This part almost had a Harry Potter feel to it, but in Kvothe's world at times it just seems childish.     Kvothe as a character only grows a little, when I expected far more changes. Kvothe the Arcane? Kvothe the Bloodless? After the second book, these monikers are still more or less a joke.     Overall the impression I got when reading this book: it was terribly, horribly rushed. Given some heavy editing, perhaps we would end up with 200~300 pages worth of material, but we have about 1000 instead. This is very sad, because it has been years since the first book.    I mourn what this book could have been. Had it been as deeply considered, and executed with the care that Name of the Wind was, this would be a work of art that I could recommend to people. As it is, I just barely think it is was worth my time, and really only in the hopes that the next book will be a return to form.
B003OML23K|5.0|I was a bit upset when I realized, after purchasing, that this book is classified as \\"young adult.\\" Blast! I'm 35 years old and just paid for a kids book?! I have never returned a single online purchase, it just seems like such a hassle (although I hear it's rather painless). The description seemed compelling enough for me to select the book, so I decided to just read it. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />I do NOT think this should be classified as a teen read. The only reasons I can think of is the age of the lead characters and the lack of sex. This book is incredibly violent. I would not want my kid to read it. That being said, I would have *certainly* read it as a child. I read Silence of the Lambs before the theatrical release while still in junior high school.  A bit hypocritical, I know.  At least I don't have any kids to censor.<br /><br />I don't want to delve into the plot developments; I hate spoilers. All I can say is: I devoured this book and the two sequels with fervor. I frequent mockingjay.net on a regular basis. I scour YouTube for videos on the series. I am obsessed and will be first in line for the planned movie. Based on my recommendation, I have introduced Panem to many friends. It is a series that stays in your head long after the last page is read.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|As I watched this movie, I was expecting another PETA style film. In actuality. The film shows you whats going on in our worlds food manufacturing companies and lets you make your own decision.

0812979656|5.0|The God of Small Things, the first (and so far, only) novel by Indian writer, Arundhati Roy, was written between 1992 and 1996. This (semi-autobiographical) story takes place in the village of Ayemenem and the town of Kottayam, near Cochin in Kerala, and is set principally during two time periods: December 1969 and 23 years later. The main characters are Esthappen (Estha) and Rahel, seven-year-old two-egg (i.e. non-identical) twins, and their mother Ammu.  Ammu falls in love with Velutha Paapen, a Paraven (Untouchable) who works for the family's Pickle Factory, a man the twins already list amongst their most-loved.  But even in 1969, with a Communist Government, parts of India are still firmly in the grip of the Caste system. By breaking the \\"Love Laws,\\" or \\"The laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much\\", Ammu and the twins set in motion \\"The Terror\\".  The manipulations of Ammu's aunt, Baby Kochamma, are instrumental in bringing down The Terror, and her subsequent cruelty to Ammu and the twins will leave readers gasping.   As well as commenting on the Caste system and Class discrimination in general, the novel examines Indian history and politics, the taboos of conventional society, and religion. But more than anything, this is a story about love and betrayal.    The innocent observations of 7-year-olds, their interpretation of unfamiliar words and phrases, the (typically Indian) Capitalisation of Significant Words, the running together of and splitting apart of words , the phonetic spelling, all are a source of humour and delight in this novel. \\"It's an afternoon-mare\\", Estha-the-Accurate replied. \\"She dreams a lot\\". Even as Estha is being molested by the Orangedrink Lemondrink man in the Abhilash Talkies, his observations (\\"Not a moonbeam.\\") bring laughter. Echoes, repetitions and resonances abound. Roy is a master of the language: \\"So futile. Like polishing firewood.\\" Her prose is luminous. This novel is powerful, moving, tragic. Beautifully written, with wonderful word pictures.  This novel demands at least two reads: once to learn the story; a second time to appreciate the echoes and repetitions and understand what the early references mean. It deserves a third reading to fully appreciate the prose, the descriptive passages. On this, my third reading, I read parts I would swear I had not read earlier. And I had tears in my eyes very early in the novel. I loved this book when I first read it: I love it even more now. I remain hopeful that Arundhati Roy will share her considerable literary talents with her eager readers in the form of another novel.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game!!!  Took several of hours to complete..I'm hoping that they pick up the storyline and continue the game with part 2 or something.  Throughly enjoyed..
1439102724|5.0|Sing You Home is Jodi Picoult's 18th novel. As always, Picoult deals with big issues. This time it is homosexuality and the attitude of society, government and, in particular, organised religion, to those who are openly homosexual. But other issues also make an appearance: as Picoult herself says, this book is about a lot of things. This novel details the single-mindedness, the almost obsessive lengths to which some people will go to overcome infertility. It asks about the fate of frozen embryos: are they people or property? Who has rights over them when a marriage breaks up? It touches on the importance of music in our lives. It examines in detail the arguments of certain religious leaders against homosexuality: the faulty logic, the quotation of scriptures out of their historical context, the convenient interpretation of biblical quotes, the power of charismatic preachers. Most of all, this novel asks the question: what is a family? As she usually does, Picoult tells the story in voices: in this case, Zoe, who has spent ten years trying to have a baby; Max, her husband, who has finally had enough, divorces her and finds God; and Vanessa, a guidance counsellor who becomes Zoe's friend and eventually, her lover. As with all of Picoult's novels, this one is thought-provoking and highly enjoyable: an excellent read!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and see something new. A movie that's pretty hard to get tired of. It captivates our imaginations and brings us into a world of infinite possibilities. It's like 'Alice In Wonderland' for adults. It's a great movie and im sure you will LOVE it(:

B004NOP55E|5.0|After ordering the sequel to \\"The Name of the Wind\\" well before finishing the first installment (I was hooked early into the narrative), I checked to see whether this gripping fantasy had won a World Fantasy Award in 2007, and was shocked to discover it wasn't even nominated for one.  It should have been.  This is the best, most intricate fantasy I've read since George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' novels.<br /><br />The young prodigy who is the hero of \\"The Name of the Wind\\" may not be the most likeable character in fantasy--he's too brash and sure of his own considerable gifts, and makes enemies much faster than he makes friends--but he is courageous, loyal to his friends (especially those of a female persuasion), and unswerving in his quest for knowledge.  When he makes mistakes, they are big ones, but they are completely believable in an adolescent genius (think of a young Richard Feynman with a gift for setting fires), who had to grow up the hard way after surviving a tragedy that would have knocked most of us out of the story.<br /><br />\\"The Name of the Wind\\" is filled with heart-stopping action, devious treachery, grand passion, and meticulous world-building.  The magical elements are cunningly wrought--not your ordinary 'swish and click' then 'shout-something-in-pig-latin' variety.  They lurk in the bones of the narrative.  In this respect the author is very much like George R.R. Martin.  If the author has a fault, it is in the overuse of foreshadowing.  However, foreshadowing is inevitable, given the structure of the novel, since the hero's story is being narrated to a Chronicler, well after the events in this book took place.<br /><br />I am waiting impatiently for the second book in this projected trilogy to show up in my mail box.  I swore I was never going to read another unfinished fantasy 'ology' after my years of unrequited waiting for George R.R. Martin's next 'Song of Ice and Fire' installment, but \\"The Name of the Wind\\" quickly changed my mind.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This CD is catchy. Great arrangements, great production, and interesting song structures. With the Crane Wife and the Hazards of Love, you could tell that the Decemberists were stretching, challenging both themselves and the listeners. The King Is Dead is all about songs, and being listenable.    It hit me towards the end of one of my recent listens - the last song, Dear Avery, fulfills the same role that \\"The Sad Cafe\\" does on the Eagles \\"Long Run\\" album. In fact, it's almost a direct copy with pedal steel guitar instead of saxophone. There's a jazzy midtempo shifting between 2 chords, there's a light Rhodes piano in the background...it floored me how similar the song structures were. And then I realized - it's a very similar CD the whole way through! Americana filtered through a modern production, with changing tempos and occasionally pointed lyrics about society today.    We'll see if I hold \\"The King is Dead\\" to the same reverence I hold \\"The Long Run\\" 30 years from now. But it's off to a good start.

159420229X|1.0|If your purpose for buying this book is to learn the techniques/skills on how to improve your memory, you will be better of googling it. On the other hand, if you are into reading about what other people are doing with their life, than by all means buy this book. Warning, the author is writing about his life experiences (i..e, Journal entry), and -here and there in the chapters- he has incorporated some of the historical/scientific facts that you could ,also, Google it up!!! Please...Please.... don't waste your money, as i have done so; if you want to learn about the techniques/skills on how to enhance your memory, you are better off googling it.

B0035G5IOE|1.0|I didn't expect much going into this movie and it still managed to disappoint.  I saw an ad for it a few years ago and just got around to watching it tonight, I say that because the ad didn't look that exciting either.  Horrible writing is what it boiled down to, it was visually appealing but the entire time I just felt like it was trying to be cleaver in the dialog but just never got to a intelligence level above a below average 10 year old.  It also was cast very poorly, none of the voices added anything to the characters.    Like I said I didn't expect much but usually when I go into a movie like this I get more than a bargained for.  This movie was just dull and drug on and on for what seemed like ever.  I would NOT recommend buying this unless you rent it first and for some odd reason end up liking it.  I had heard that young kids don't like it, it is hard for them to sit through a long unfunny movie, and it is not witty in anyway so I confused as to who this movie was aimed at.    There is one odd part of the movie, I don't know if it was in the book, where Mr. Fox has a dialog about a wolf he sees in the distance.  I think it is supposed to be significant in some way since it just does not fit into the story.  All I can think of is George Clooney is an environmentalist which I don't know for sure since he is such a horrible actor and I don't follow him.    Eh, oh well, I don't feel bad about giving this movie one star, it was just horrible.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was recommended by one of my friends and she told me I would LOVE it. So I of course took her advice and got the book and I have to admit that at the beginning it was a little confusing but by the time I got to the end I couldn't put the book down. I was very impressed by the history incorporated into the book. I have to admit that there was an intellectual twist to it.    Personally I am a sucker when it comes to a good romance and at first I would get frustrated how the love scenes would stop just when they got started but even though they were short or didn't last as long as I would have liked for them to I still felt the love for them and that is hard to do in such a short scene.    This is my first review I have attempted to write merely because of the bad reviews. Some of the bad reviews bash the book. THIS IS THE BEGINNING TO A TRILOGY!!!! Of course it may not have too much action and there are many details! It is getting you ready for what is to come! I loved this book and want everyone to give it a chance because I promise you won't be let down.    LOVED IT!!

B004GXKBFQ|5.0|PJ Hogan's \\"Peter Pan\\" is my favorite rendition of JM Barrie's beloved classic about the charming and wild boy who never grows up.  More than any other version preceding it, Hogan puts the struggles of adolescence and the ruminations on childhood front and center in this tory, whereas previous versions merely brushed against these issues in a superficial way.  Hogan even allows the attraction between Peter and Wendy to feel a bit more..., well...\\"heated\\" as opposed to more platonic.  That is not to say this version is crude or inappropriate, but Hogan allows these elements to flow more freely and with dramatic logic.  Hogan's version is faithful, but he has made changes here, and I dare say, much needed ones which update this story is the best possible sense, most notably, the ending...instead of Peter returning to Wendy years later and finding out she's an adult and he then starts anew with adventures with her daughter.  It instead ends on a much more logical note which is when the lost boys are \\"adopted\\" by Wendy's family and Peter still makes the decision, and a devastating one, to remain a boy and he flies away.  Instead of this moment feelinglike a triumph, it feels like an escape born out of fear.  Which is exactly what it is.    \\"Peter Pan\\", more than most others, is one of the titles I have been anticipating with baited breath on Blu-ray.  The film is so visually dazzling and the special effects, sets, costumes, and art direction are so beautiful, it screams hi-def \\"eye candy.\\"  I was not disappointed.  From the first shot, a surrealized VFX shot illustrating the snowy rooftops of London, I kept saying \\"Wow\\", under my breath.  Universal's VC-1 encode is beautiful, framing the picture at 2.40 in 1080p.  There is a light veneer of film grain which gives the film a warm, filmic texture.  There is some mild use of DNR, however, this can be traced back to the source and you will notice it only in certain VFX shots, so this is director intention.  I did not noticeany glaring edge enhancement, and ringing, aliasing, noise, debris, etc. never rear their heads.  This transfer exceeded my expectations on Blu-ray and fans should be equally pleased.      More of a surprise, is the DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack, which is fabulous...creating an immersive experience that the SD DVDs serviceable, but underwhelming, lossy DD 5.1 simply did not provide.  Sound effects are awesome, with lots of rear channel activity complete with great directionality and pans (I had to!), and the whooshes and thumps of the LFE which comprise the action scenes are exciting and reveal much more imaging than I expected.  There was a lot of sound information I heard for the first time such as some of the lost boys' wisecracks as they talk over each other, those lines are now present in the ambient surrounds and cross-channel pans. James Newton-Howard's brilliant, magical score comes heart-poundingly to life in all its lossless glory.  Dialogue is crisp and well-prioritized with evey syllable being crystal clear.  Look at the scene where the entire cast performs the famous \\"I Do Believe in fairies\\" scene which needs to balance score, dialogue, sound effects from thunder and lightning, etc....there are a number of complex elements, and it was a muddy mess in SD Dolby, but it now is a tour de force with every element being imaged brilliantly in this lossless encode.  It i he only way all this information can be handled.  It isnow the exhilarating scene I knew it was.    This is a must-have for fans of the film, and certainly hi-def junkies.  It is a reference grade disc in my opinion, and it is a no-brainer for an upgrade if you already own it on SD DVD.  Highly recommended.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It deserves 5 stars but unfortunately the app stopped working properly... At first everything was fine preloaded 23 stations this morning I was a happy camper. Now several stations are not loading or playing. Hopefully it can be fixed after that I'll change my review.

B003L20IFQ|4.0|'Buried' is the kind of film I probably won't watch again. It's not that the film isn't good enough for a second viewing, but after you know the ending, it wouldn't be the same. Ryan Reynolds gives a solid performance in this claustrophobic and grim tale of a man buried alive with only hours to try to figure out the who, what, where and why of his deadly and horrific situation.<br /><br />The film takes place real time and we spend the entire film in this coffin, which is both unsettling and depressing. After the first 20 minutes I was wondering how they were going to keep this film interesting, but I was never bored and I was completely engrossed. This film is not going to be for everyone especially if you are in the least bit claustrophobic!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I like these types of games, it was nice to see it on Android. Completely worth it to kill an hour or so. (Now 25 words)
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|I watched this film and 'Buried' in one evening and I think my claustrophobic tendencies were put through enough to last me a while. 'Devil' is a well made horror film with some very disturbing images and thought provoking ideas. The film mainly takes place in an elevator with 5 passengers, but what happens over the next hour and twenty minutes had me completely engrossed even if I guessed who the man downstairs was right off the bat(dumb luck? or veteran horror know how?). I have seen a couple of new horror films recently that have taken a step in the right direction adding atmosphere and deliberate pacing over FX and blood. This is an excellent horror film.
0385341008|4.0|First, you need to know that I bought this book two years ago. I started reading it twice before, and despite its catchy title,  could not get past the first few pages. With my Kindle still missing, I was desperate for a good book, and once again picked up GUERNSEY. I told myself, \\"Now think! Pay attention! This book has great reviews! You will `get-it' this time.\\" And I did. It was completely delightful, informative, warm and horrific. It left me mourning the departure of the characters when the book was finished. There's a time for everything, and I'm glad I saved GUERNSEY for the right time in my life.<br /><br />Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands, between The United Kingdom and France. A small agricultural and fishing island, Guernsey and its neighboring Jersey were known to me only as British Islands lending their names to breeds of cattle. Now I know a little bit more. The islands were occupied by German soldiers during World War II. In this novel we see how this affected the lives of the unpretentious locals.<br /><br />Our heroine is a London author who receives a letter from a Guernsey bibliophile in 1946. After the war, the devastated island was left without many things, including access to books. The relationship that builds between the correspondents eventually leads to our heroine's visit, and her subsequent ardor for the land, culture and people of Guernsey.<br /><br />We get to hitch hike along, as we learn to love and understand the colorful characters of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  The Society is born of a group of unlikely non-readers. They are forced to form a reader's club as a cover story for breaking the German curfew one night. Their lives are changed as they become a close-knit group of literature aficionados, supporting one another through the horrors of the occupation.<br /><br />The novel consists entirely of letters. We eavesdrop on the thoughts and private conversations revealed in these letters, and soon put together the story. If you enjoy HISORICAL FICTION, ROMANCE, CHARACTER STUDY, CLASSIC LIT or WW II INFORMATION you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Also interesting is the fact that this was Mary Ann Shaffer's first novel. She became very ill near its completion and called on her niece, Annie Barrows, to help her finish it. Shaffer died before seeing the book in print.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------HISORICAL FICTION, ROMANCE, CHARACTER STUDY, CLASSIC LIT or WW II INFORMATION you will enjoy this book.

B001LRJH0U|1.0|I just watched this movie for the first time, and was compelled to write my first review of a DVD. Both action and emotion were no where to be found, nor was an original storyline. I am astounded that the makers of this movie had the likes of Mortensen, Harris, and for god's sake Jeremy Irons- and still managed to make an unbelievably boring, lackluster film. If you have trouble sleeping,watch this movie.

B004QYZATW|1.0|The actors phoned this one in for a paycheck.  They are as bored performing in it as the audience is watching it.  This is a truly awful movie.  Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck must have been bored directing it as well since his movie, 'The Lives of Others', is so excellent. That is the movie to watch, not this wretched thing.
0689865384|1.0|I thought Twilight was the epitome of bad...but I was wrong. The Uglies is ten times worse because the issues and characters are incessantly annoying and juvenile. Many people who read this book, just end up with the urge to yell at the characters and tell them to get over their looks. It is really only another shallow book for teenage girls. When you step back and look at bad teen books as a whole, you realize that they are all the same book, repeated over and over again with different names and varying settings. Don't read too many these books, it gets boring and repetitive.

0385340567|5.0|There's one main reason why so many people give this novel a bad review: Lee Child is telling them that there's no such thing as Santa Claus.  That TRUTH, is a hard pill to swallow...for children of all ages.  Actually, there are two Santa Claus' that Childs exposes to the religious right in this, excellently written, Jack Reacher novel.   First, there's no such thing as the \\"Rapture\\", or the second coming of Christ, or any other religious nonsense about Armageddon.  Second, every military campaign that the United States has instigated since the end of WWII has been politically motivated...and therefore, has been totally unjustified, but has nevertheless resulted in scores of senseless deaths, indiscriminate destruction and ruined lives.  This includes our current involvement in Iraq and Afganistan.  Yes, the names of the towns in this novel: \\"Hope\\" and \\"Despair\\" are trite, and maybe a Jack Reacher novel is not the right vehicle to impart this important message to the ignorant of the world, but thank you taking a stab at it just the same Mr. Child.  Keep up the good work.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|I'm a George Harrison fan. He contributed a lot to the Beatles with his guitar playing and harmony singing, he wrote some fine songs and he was also the Beatle with the best sense of humor, to my mind (John was too cutting, Ringo was too obvious and Paul really doesn't have much of a sense of humor- he's very pleasant, but not funny). Despite being the 'quiet one', he frequently topped the 'most popular Beatle' polls.    However, as you get into this album, a couple of things emerge. First, he wasn't a great solo singer. He's adequate, but it isn't long before you begin to realize there was a reason he only got one or two songs on each Beatles album. His voice just doesn't match up to those of Lennon and McCartney, not that he's alone in that. A full CD of George starts to get a bit wearing after the first 8 or 10 tracks.    Second, as a song-writer, he was at his best when he was around Lennon and McCartney. The three songs from the Beatles repetoire included here (While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Something and Here Comes The Sun) are the best things he wrote and worthy of inclusion in any list of great songs of the late 1960s. The five songs from 'All Things Must Pass', again written while he was still a Beatle, are also very good. The further he gets away from Lennon and McCartney, the less the creative fire within him seems to be stimulated, both in quality and quantity. From superb in the late 1960s, to very good in the early 1970s to not all that memorable in his later years is a steady progression. It has often been said that neither Lennon nor McCartney were as good without the other, and the same is true of Harrison; he needed them to push him to his best work. The Beatles were a unique phenomenon and George was a big part of it- with both the pros and cons that came with it.     Many people reviewing this record have commented that it should have been a bigger, more comprehensive collection. For me, this was enough; indeed, it might have been a couple of tracks too many to listen to at one sitting.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Played this on Droid X. Force closed on me twice, then had no problems.<br /><br />Graphics are nice and game play reminds me of Nintendo DS games like Hotel Dusk.<br /><br />The game runs a bit short. I think I finished in about an hour. The puzzles are fun and not too hard. I got the game free so was not disappointed, though I think it's probably worth the usual $1 price.
0671646788|4.0|This book is nothing more than many pieces of excellent advice with descriptive examples. TMOTB tells you how to be a better employee, a better boss, a better entrepreneur, and a better partner in your relationships. If you read the book, make summaries on some cards, and gradually incorporate the lessons into your life, there is no doubt you will achieve more success in all aspects of your life. Of course, reading and having good intentions is easy; the difficult part is making the changes, putting in the necessary effort.<br />The reason I give only four stars is the following: the book was written a long time ago, and it shows. The examples are dated, \\"he\\" is used throughout, and women are portrayed in a manner outdated by a half century. Despite this major flaw, I strongly recommend the book to those determined to improve their lives.
0440241901|5.0|I actually listened to this book on CD from the library. I loved it! It captures you from the first scenario, and although you have an idea how things will work out, there's lots of nice twists and turns along the way. I also like the friends and family scenarios that are included. I felt I knew Emma, wanted to cringe when she did, felt bad for her. That takes talent; so many books you don't really connect with the main character and that truly throws off the read. Great job S. Kinsella!
B004FOA84A|3.0|Basic and short. Good graphics, but without any animation it's not very hard to do. I had an issue with force closes one time, but it went away and no problems since. Fun while it lasted, you're basically paying a dollar for a little over 30 minutes of entertainment.
0756404738|2.0|I read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and loved it.  It was one of the best books I had ever read.  I was excited by the character and the story.  This book is tedious.  To those who say, \\"Not a word is wasted.\\"  I disagree.  I think about 75% of the book is superfluous fluff that distracts rather than adds to the story.  The story hardly moves forward and after waiting so long for it I am very disappointed.

B003YFIUW8|1.0|I am amazed at the raves for this book, which I found arch, contrived, and tiresome.  There's only so much a 5 year old can convey, despite the clever conceit.  Knowing this was based on the infamous Josef Fritzl case, who kept his daughter for 24 years locked in a secret hideaway and fathered SEVEN children with her, ROOM just feels like a weak effort at recreating a situation of truly epic monstrosity.  I found myself flipping pages or skimming.  But obviously this work has touched many people deeply, so go know.
0517548232|1.0|Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new.  It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.    And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.      Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I think that many reviews have given a great background of the story.  To be honest I didn't even realize this was based on a comic.  This is just my opinion of the TV series itself.    I picked this one from the Amazon Vine program for my husband.  He loves SciFi and Zombie movies.  We watched it together and for me it was a good storyline, but a bit too graphic.  The blood and gore was just too over the top for me and the scene with the horse...well, let's just say if it had not been on dvd I probably would have changed the channel.    My husband felt it was just like other Zombie movies where the humans are just trying to survive.  He thought the graphics and the settings were great (amazing actually) and he watched every episode.  He did think that the human aspect and the storylines that they had were pretty good and drew you in.  Basically it was a great emotional Human tale whose enemy just happens to be zombies.    I think another viewer said it best that the zombies are secondary to the human aspect.  This is a small group of people trying to survive, be a family, maintain order, and live with the threat of death constantly hanging over their heads.  I think that it is a great group of actors and they do a wonderful job of of portraying ordinary people whose lives have been turned inside out and now they are just trying to live day to day.  It definetly didn't feel like a TV series, but one long movie.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is one of those movies that will be appreciated over a long time and have a cult following for its camp value. It's truly just a fun movie with AMAZING dancing, costumes, big time musical numbers, and of course singing from legendary divas Cher and Christina Aguilera.     The story is pretty typical, if not done the death. Simple small-town girl Christina Aguilera has Hollywood dreams. Her talent and passion takes her LA where she finds herself waitressing in a burlesque club owned by Cher. Soon enough Christina becomes a star for the club. A lot of other things happen in between that just make you smile and shake your head at the same time. The movie is almost shameless in how cheesy it is but it doesn't come off as being cheap or desperate. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B003PIUBZS|1.0|There is so much thick, slow motion blood in this flick, I got confused about whether I was watching a movie or a Lava Lamp.  Beavis and Butthead types will love this, but if you're more into stories with substance - skip it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was skeptical when I first started reading this, but by the time the characters left Oxford I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  the historical references, amd intrigue kept me glued to the pages more than the romance.  My only complaint is that I will have to wait until next year for the sequel.
1439163146|4.0|I may be one of the few reviewers here to actually read one of these stories without awareness of who the author was.  It was published in a magazine, and I found it to be pretty engaging and well-written.  It was only after I finished that I looked back at the title page to see who the author was.  Obviously, with celebrities it's hard to be objective, and a lot of the reviews here are tainted with such biases.  I love the short story form, and read a wide variety of them by many authors.  Franco's no T.C. Boyle, Nabokov, Alice Munro or Denis Johnson, but this is a good first collection. While the subject of the stories aren't entirely my bag of meat, they have their merits. Excellent character development, a fairly lean style, and a subtle, steady rhythm are among them.  I would recommend this book to serious short story fans, and look forward to Franco fulfilling the promise he shows here.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|One of the positives of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is simply that it is different and original. With so many blah movies that try to be trendy, especially with the \\"heartbroken\\" kid trying to find love, at least this film takes the \\"finding love\\" concept in an interesting and original way: using a graphic novel format. While the characters might be flimsy in depth, and the plot a little simplistic, this film is a nice change to a market of moviemaking that mostly fails to take any chances any more. It has some charm, plenty of wit, great sense of humor (in a funny-enough-to-laugh-at-itself kind of way), great music, plenty of visuals, and a message (although you really have to wait to find out what it is). It doesn't take itself too seriously, but relishes the idea of bringing one slacker's quest to find love in a unique way: part video game, part film.     Based on the graphic novel, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World centers on the story of Scott Pilgrim's quest to find love. His major problem is that he is fairly clueless about it. Scott (Michael Cera) is infatuated with the idea of seeing and dating the beautiful and mysterious Ramona.  However, to do this, he must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes, a league of obnoxious ex-boyfriends. Thrust into each battle, which is similar to a life-like video game, he has to try to find a way to outsmart or outwit the ex and pass to the next round. Along the way, he learns that Ramona has plenty of baggage in her past. He also learns that he hasn't been the best person, but it takes dealing with the exes to realize this. Earning self respect is the bigger quest of Scott Pilgrim, not finding love.     While I enjoyed the film generally, there were some problems. For one, Michael Cera has a way of grating on the nerves. He is the one-trick pony of the geeky, whiny, wimpy slacker-type hopeless romantic, which it seems he plays in every single film. Although Cera had many of the character traits for this character, and although I'm thetype that loves to root for underdog types, I just thought it might have been better cast (although no alternative come to mind). Another problem was simply that there is a superficial level to the characters, mainly because of the way the story is presented, with quickly moving scenes jumping around.     Still, the film has great entertainment value. It has a way of taking jabs at political correctness and pop culture and has nonstop quips by characters, especially during the fight scenes. It has enough wit to keep you entertained, some rocking music to enjoy, and really brings a fun approach to the graphic novel turned film genre. Kudos to the director for this film's sheer inventiveness. I don't think the film is all bells and whistles though, all entertainment; Pilgrim has to learn some lessons about how to not act to others.     Great film, awesome extras. If you are sick of the same old thing, this is a movie to check out!

B004GJDQT8|5.0|I was shopping for a birthday present for my 3 year old at Toys R Us when we came upon a product we didn't know much about.  I went out and got my Xoom from my car and brought it in to see what I could find out on Amazon.  I loved that I could type or scan in the UPC and Amazon brought up the product.  I could look at the price, reviews, options, and accessories right from my Xoom.  I scanned another couple accessories and when they came up much cheaper, I put them in my cart and as I was paying for the rest of my purchases, I purchased the items that were cheaper from Amazon.  It was so convenient and easy.<br /><br />As I've played around with this this app a little more since, I like the simplicity of the shopping.  I like that you can quickly navigate around to find the products that you are looking for and make an easy purchase.  Scanning the barcode in is one of my favorite parts!  I'm kind of new to this technology stuff so I found that really fun.  :)
B001JQM7TG|5.0|One of the most fascinating books I have ever read, it carefully, and gradually explains the power of thought, a creative thought that through attention, concentration causes action which brings form. After reading this book, I will never look at me, and the world around me the same way. I read it last evening, and woke up this morning, ready to live the rest of my life more aware, more conscious. Enjoy! You will no regret it! The fact that you are reading this review, already means you are in the right place.

B003UESJH4|4.0|Geeze, I am SO behind on writing reviews. I've seen like three movies at the theater that I haven't even started writing about, and if I go too long before writing about them I start forgetting details, and then the review is a little generic, and the economy suffers, America falls behind, and let's face it: the terrorists have won. All that riding on my shoulders! You see why I'm stressed. It's all because there has been a ton of WORK at work lately, which is outrageous and inhumane [Amnesty International is currently investigating].    All right, I suppose we must turn our attention to the film at hand. This is an Oscar-bait movie that is so all-round good in every way that you'll think it's the mid-90s and Miramax is still owned by the Weinsteins. We open in 1929 with Colin Firth as soon-to-be King George VI barely able to get a complete word out while giving a speech at a public race, to be broadcast nationwide on the radio, then a fairly new invention. This creates a great wrinkle, as before, if you embarrassed yourself, it was just in front of the attending company. Now it's broadcast across the country and perhaps the world. The movie gets the rhythm just right of showing the crowd looking expectantly at him, then slowly turning away as though embarrassed themselves, when they realize how badly he's choking.    Then his wife, played by Helena Bonham Carter, goes to the office of Geoffery Rush as Lionel Logue, Australian import and unconventional speech therapist. They have apparently gone to all the other speech therapists, and found them all useless. Logue insists that the future king come to his office [rather than he go to the palace], insists on calling him \\"Bertie,\\" and imposes a number of other rules, all of which George is not used to. Firth plays George as a proud man mortified by his speech inability, one who quickly leaps to anger rather than deal with feeling embarrassed and inadequate. Rush plays Logue as a sensitive man comfortable with his eccentricity and confident of his then-unusual methods.    Logue is the only therapist who is able to get results, so George is soon coming every week. Logue says it's best to work on both psychological and mechanical speech blockages, but George wants \\"Just mechanical.\\" This is all well and good for a while, because the next person in line to be king is George's older brother Edward, played by the always-delightful Guy Pearce. Problem is, Edward is seeing a divorced woman, who is also known to be seeing other men at the same time, and he plans to marry her, although this is strictly forbidden. Nevertheless, George wants Edward to stay on the throne, because if he doesn't George will have to, and this would thrust George into the spotlight, where he will have to endure a series of embarrassing moments on the world's stage. So there's this unspoken issue that George is unable to advance and accept his greatness and move into the next stage of manhood, because he is held back by this issue.    What interested me most about this movie is that it is a story about psychotherapy, but taking place before the real age of psychotherapy [Freud was active in Austria, but he hadn't been put into wide practice in England yet]. It is clear that George's speech problems are largely psychological, and as they gradually open up and get to know and trust each other--a relationship that has to navigate all sorts of ideas about Royal vs. non-Royal propriety--George is able to gain confidence and eventually to open up personally to Logue. And there are scenes that will be familiar to anyone who has been through therapy, such as when the therapist pushes the patient too far, and drives him away for a time. So this is all about psychotherapy before there WAS a fully-formed field of psychotherapy.    For this reason, as well as the many obstacles thrown up by their differing social stations, the relationship that grows up between George and Logue is incredibly satisfying. George is believably gruff and distant at first, but we also see his anguished vulnerability as he faces horrible public embarrassment. The movie also expertly lays out hints of why he has his psychological issues, but without hammering too hard on any of them. Their relationship grows slowly and believably, without a false note, and it is satisfying toward the end to see George fiercely defending Logue and demanding his right to a place near him [although he is a non-Royal and not even a proper Englishman], as well as crowd-pleasing scenes like when Logue's wife finally learns who her husband's secret client really is.    When this first came out, it got somewhat mediocre reviews from some quarters for being the slightest bit TOO perfect. And it's true--it's well-made, well-written, well-acted, and pretty much everything is in place and working perfectly. And since it harks back to the golden age of Miramax and really seems to belong to that era, fifteen years ago, it can seem a little tired even upon release. So the element of surprise and discovering something a bit out of the ordinary is not to be found here. Nevertheless, a movie criticized as being too perfect is still pretty perfect, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with a movie your parents will like every bit as much as you do, or that everyone can agree upon. This may be bald Oscar-bait, but it's worthy Oscar-bait and it deserved the Oscars it won. It's just a plain `ol good, interesting, well-made movie.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Admiring Colin Firth, as an actor, as I do, I, of course, was drawn to this film of \\"King's Speech\\".  As in his earlier film \\"A Single Man\\", Colin is staggering as George VI (Bertie to his family and father to the presently reigning Monarch, Elizabeth)  Firth, as in \\"A single Man\\", gives an outstanding  performance as a \\"royal\\" that is very content living as  a devoted father and husband enjoying not  having  to be \\"in the spotlight\\" until all changes with the abdication of his older brother (wonderfully acted by Guy Pierce, starred in \\"Percilla queen of the desert),  With that abdication and because of the immense speaking  responsibilities that accompany \\"being king\\", Bertie has to face his one BIG problem--he has a severe speech impediment and stutters horribly which, of course, does not fit into being a \\"good\\"  Monarch.  How is he going to motivate the masses to be \\"strong\\" during a major crisis such as World War II?  Stuttering just would not be too \\"kingly\\" or motivating to the masses.   Thus being the royal that he is, he has got to get help from any source that he can.  His wife (acted fabulously by the unorthodox actress, Helena Carter of \\"Room with a view\\") finds a \\"lower class\\" speech therapist, Lionel Logue that is acted sublimely by Geoffrey Rush, of \\"Pirates of the Caribbian.  Heated arguments between Bertie and Lionel ensue mainly because Logue feels that Bertie's speech problems are more psychological than physical bring up \\"royal family issues\\" that Bertie, as a royal, just does not want to admit to (e.g., his father and older brother were rather overbearing and not too nice to him) Added to the fact that Lionel is not afraid to ask some \\"deep \\"and seemly impertinent  questions about the Royal Family that Bertie is very uncomfortable about answering, plus  he does not want to differentiate to Bertie  because he is king--he refuses to call him \\"sir\\" just Bertie.      All-in-all, \\"King's Speech\\" is really a very good film. The direction, recreation ofthe era and, most of all, the acting is tremendous.   (I really enjoyed seeing Derek Jacoby of \\"I Claudius\\" fame in the small role of the archbishop.I must also mention that in the very small role of Bertie's father, George V, actor Michael Gambon  is so very good that he almost \\"blows\\" all of the other actors off the screen. Be sure to look for Anthony Andrews and Claire Bloom from \\"Brideshead Revisited\\". )

1595141715|5.0|(Review originally posted at GoneWithTheWords.com)<br /><br />How many of you have known someone who's committed suicide? A classmate, friend, relative? I can think of 3. Two classmates and a friend's younger sister. I wasn't close to any of them, I was friendly with them, said hello or goodbye when I passed them in the halls, maybe had a drink with them at a party, but I wouldn't have called them my friends. And unlike Hannah's situation, theirs were all made in haste with a gunshot, over break-ups. There were no signs, no hints. The fact they weren't your friends doesn't take away the feeling of wishing to have been able to say something...do something, anything. To tell them it's not worth it, that although their heart is exploding with pain at this moment, it will get better.<br /><br />This book brought out a lot of emotions from me. Obviously it made think of the people I just talked about, but also, while reading about Hannah's reasons it made me remember how quickly and thoroughly rumors can change a person's life. Reading them triggered some of my own long-buried memories from high school that I would rather not rehash. I think that's why I connected so completely with this book. While my own experiences never escalated to Hannah's point, I still understood her feelings a little too clearly at times.<br /><br />The unique style this book is written added to how affected I was by it. It's not Hannah's chapter, then Clay's chapter with his reaction. It's Clay listening to Hannah and reacting to her words in real-time, per say. The fact that Clay is reacting as he's listening to the tapes made me feel like I was the one with the headphones on.<br /><br />Hannah's revelations are all heart-wrenching, but it didn't stop me from needing to know the whole story. This book is definitely a page-turner. I was up until 4AM reading and started it back up as soon as I could the next day.<br /><br />What I'll be taking away from it, as Clay does, is to not ignore any possible signs. To try harder and push past our comfort zones and reach out to those who we think may be going through difficult times. To watch my words and actions to others. You never know what that person may be going through and how you could unknowingly be adding to their distress.<br /><br />I strongly recommend for everyone to read this book. To share with their students, children, nieces, nephews, friends...everyone. We can all learn something from this book.t our comfort zones and reach out to those who we think may be going through difficult times. To watch my words and actions to others.

0307346617|4.0|\\"World War Z\\" by author Max Brooks (son of comedian/director Mel Brooks), is an \\"oral history of the Zombie War\\", similar in style to several real-life oral history books, particularly on World War II.  Once you get past the premise, that a virus causes humans to become literally undead beings (and if you can't get past that, what are you doing buying the book? :-) ), it's an entertaining, fun read.<br /><br />The format is that the \\"author\\" of the oral history interviews survivors of the war, from those who were there when the viral transformation started, continuing through the infection's rapid spreading and the near total collapse of civilization, and finishes after the humanity's costly victory.<br /><br />There are plot holes based on the premise ... such as why an undead zombie would eat human flesh, yet can go for years without eating anything ... but the author papers over most of them, and ignores others.  But this isn't a story about the nuts-and-bolts of zombie-ism, it's a book about what happens to humanity, and what it cost in human terms to survive and ultimately triumph over the zombies.  Considered on that level, the book is compelling, well-plotted, and well-written.<br /><br />The author takes more than a few shots at government and bureaucracy, and many, if not most of these shots, are probably right-on-target.  That's not to say it's a preachy book, but it lends a bit of credibility about how the epidemic could occur and spread wildly out of control.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book to entertain you for a few hours, this book will more than do the job.

The cinematography, screenplay, and action scenes are golden, and held my son's attention as well as mine.  My son was amazed at how many lines of dialogue I could say at the same time as the characters and is now eager to see the next Die Hard.  I think this is in the top-3 all time of all action movies, and possibly holds the top slot alone.<br /><br />Yippee!

B0036EH3WU|5.0|I never saw Lost when it was on TV, and then my son bought the DVDs separately and I watched them after he was finished. I was mesmerized; I immediately became an instant Lost fan.  The anticipation of waiting for the DVDs from my son was driving me crazy. After watching the last DVD I couldn't believe there was no more \\"Lost\\" to watch. I literally was having \\"Lost\\" withdrawal.      And so, I purchased \\"Lost: The Complete Collection\\" and watched every minute of \\"Lost\\" again.  I just finished, and I am already having \\"Lost\\" withdrawal. Watching it a second time you pick up things you didn't in the firsr go around.    The actors picked to play the roles of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, and all the other regulars were perfect for the parts they played.  The story grips you from the beginning and you get \\"lost\\" in the story.  You can't wait to see the next DVD.  The story led me to wonder what exactly would I have done in a situation like the ones the characters found themselves in. It makes you think about whether you would be strong enough to be one of the survivors.    The product that I purchased is wonderful.  Even the box holding the DVDs, a booklet with descriptions of the different scenes and the game Jacob and his brother played are wonderful.      I would not hesitate in the least to purchase this product, but alas there are no more DVDs to watch, and I know I will be watching a third time because the storyline grips you and holds you interest and attention from the first DVD until the last.
078401213X|5.0|I don't know if this is as good as my rating, but it's so odd, brave,  idiosyncratic and haunting, that I want to forgive it it's flaws.     Made on a shoestring, but using those limitation to create a unique  look and style, this is a psychological thriller about paranoia and  ideas, that puts you inside the lead character's head as he slowly  cracks up, trying to figure out the mathematical basis of all life. He  gets mixed up with Hassidic Jews who think he may have found the true  name of god, and wall street traders who want his secret for riches.     Full of surreal touches, it's not always clear what's real and what's  in our lead character's head - but rather than being annoying, that  only pulls you in deeper. To me it recalled great surreal earlier films  like \\"Eraserhead\\", and \\"Seconds\\", but on speed.

B003Q6D2BE|5.0|After seeing this in the movies, I was instantly sold on this movie. A great cast and a great plot that keeps you gripped to your seat. The Blu Ray format brings out all those special effects in gorgeous graphics! Plus the special features on the special edition are a great bonus to watch as well.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Nice little mystery game with gadgets.   Fun little music too.   Good way to spend an hour or two.   Always keeps you thinking ahead.  Clever clues and puzzles that you can actually solve in decent time.
B00015YVD6|5.0|A somewhat modern Little Mermaid type tale of it's time, Splash is a definite classic! The cast is perfect, and that goes past the two main characters with John Candy and even Eugene Levi bringing in the laughs at every turn. It'll make you laugh your butt off and even cry your eyes out...like good Romantic Comedy's should be with a little fantasy twist.<br /><br />I'm proud to add this to my movie Collection and can never get enough of it still after all these years. I think I even watched it twice when I first got it in the mail the first day haha!
B004LWZW0Q|5.0|This movie is a must see! Everyone 6 and up will greatly enjoy it! It's even better than the first. I can't wait for it to come out on dvd so I can buy it immediately and add it to my collection of classics.

This is a wonderful how to sculpt book. I'd recommend it to anyone who would like to learn doll making with polymer clay.

B001USHRCK|5.0|Buy this before it disappears.  This set is so nice.  The buildings have a very nice style and there are so many extras to make the display very entertaining.  I loved it so much, I bought a 2nd one.  I ordered some red pieces from Bricklink so I could build the blue building as a dark red building.   The bags are not numbered, so you will need to take some time sorting them before you start building, but I always enjoy that part.  It is nice to appreciate the unique pieces before they become part of the build.  Each of the buildings opens up so you can display them closed for a more compact display or open for a more spread out display.  And ... lots of different mini figures.  This is an older Lego set, so if you are on the fence, do not think about it too long ... you may lose your chance at a great set with lots of pieces for such a value.
0060936223|5.0|Well written and engrossing, Patti does a fantastic job of developing the the growth of a relationship, and of two artists. What it DOES NOT do is really tell you much about either of their careers. Judging from the book's photos, I'd say I'm a better photographer than Robert Mapplethorpe- but a quick google search of hias work put that to rest. I guess that supports the notion that this book isn't about either's art, it is about them as artists, and people. The book is not without flaws (mostly gaps), but considering I knew very little about either person, yet needed to keep reading, I feel like I owe this one a 5* rating.

B003YK42LQ|5.0|This album goes on my short list of new albums that i've become obsessed with. The Clash, Sandinista. The 'Mats...well, everything. Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon. Pearl Jam, Ten. What do I love most? KOL has the best vocalist in current rock scene. The ethereal, raw, beautiful guitar sound. The uncanny rhythm section. The honest, direct but not overly clever lyrucs. No one else sounds like these guys and they play with heart, write killer melodies...this is a classic!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The 3rd season is even better than the 2nd, which was better than the 1st, which was wonderful. This show is smart and funny, and when it's sweet it's never cloying. May it last for many seasons to come!
B00013RC66|5.0|Debra Winger plays a Federal Agent in pursuit of a mysterious woman who marries wealthy men who then die a few months after the marriages. Theresa Russell plays the beautiful \\"Black Widow\\" who stays a few steps ahead of the agent until after the third such murder. The two meet in Hawaii and become friends, then adversaries and then square off against each other as the plot moves to it's unlikely but interesting climax. Michael Small's sparingly effective film score accentuates suspense and there are a variety of entertaining performances from supporting cast members Dennis Hopper, Diane Ladd, Nicol Williamson and Leo Rossi, among others.   Well worth viewing, especially for those who enjoy the Femme Fatale genre, as I do.
0792838068|5.0|I won't write a long review with big words. Promise. This movie is a ***** star must see for anyone (Rated R). Those who may appreciate it most have woken up and needed a drink just to use a computer mouse or remembered what happened the night before and swear they will never drink again.. but do. There is love, pain, language, A surreal glimpse in the dark and light side of too many or too few peoples lives. Ben, \\"We both know that I'm a drunk. And I know you are a hooker. I hope you understand that I am a person who is totally at ease with that.

B0041KKYBA|4.0|Finance has been my career.  I expected the documentary to be biased, and was not disappointed on first viewing, but because of the Oscar, I watched it again - and changed my mind.  It is first-hand accounts of the environment, actions and motives that nearly (and may yet have) ruined our economy.  Even allowing for content selection bias, to maintain perspective every American should see this film.
B00110K62U|4.0|It is hard to overstate just how great was the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall. The incredible cast, backed by a truly wonderful symphony orchestra, gave this inspired musical its full scope. I got my first recording of this a few years ago, buying it from the PBS fundraising special. That was a videotape recording. I almost wore it out, playing it over and again. It is one of my two favorite music recordings of all time. So I was happy to be able to update recently to the DVD. The performance remains great, of course, but I have one disappointing caveat to the DVD. On the videotape, after the end of the performance, we were able to see the extended standing ovation from the audience, feeling just as we feel having watched and listened to these amazing singers putting their souls into these inspired songs. Cameron Mackintosh then came onstage and spoke for a time of the travails of originally bringing Les Mis to the stage. He then introduced the incoming parade of Jean Valjeans from many nations, each singing in his own language. The DVD cut directly from the end of the performance to the parade of Jean Valjeans, leaving out the extended applause and all of Cameron Mackintosh. I found that very disappointing. I miss what is missing.

0307272702|5.0|[[ASIN:0307272702 Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]] This is a thoughtful review of the problem from a scientific perspective written by a non-scientist. The evidence against refined carbohydrates as causes of the modern epidemic of obesity (as apposed to increased fat intake or laziness) is compelling. As interesting is the summary of the lack of evidence that fat intake has anything to do with obesity or health and the failure of many studies to substantiate the hypothesis long accepted as truth that high fat diets are dangerous. This is not a \\"how to\\" diet book but an exploration of the scientific evidence and review of the effects of various dietary approaches. Before reading this and realizing that \\"sweet\\" is not necessarily a good thing, I might have described the book as a \\"short and sweet\\" summary of scientific evidence. The best such overview ever written.

0156034026|1.0|This book is a total waste of money, the book is boring and pointless. The basic of the book seems to be - author wanted to write a book...he had nothing to write about...so he wrote this book and gave it a title that will attract readers...
0316069353|1.0|The characterisation is relatively weaker and the plot is much more wooden than preceding books. This book is clearly a pass.
0312600844|3.0|I bought Freedom by Jonathan Franzen (on Amazon, of course) simply because various people told me \\"There's a Richard Katz character in this novel!\\" (and my name is Richard Katz).  These were all people who had read the novel; and if the Richard Katz character had been totally random and totally unrelated to anything I am, they would not have found it remarkable.    There's something about the Richard Katz character that definitely would trip the human Relate-O-Meter.    When I actually sat down to read Freedom, though, two things happened, kind of a good, the bad, and the Ugly:  The good -- after not too many pages, it gets into this fascinating story of Patty Berglund getting raped by some preppy named Ethan Post; Ethan's rich dad is going to make it just impossible for Patty to get any justice even though she is determined to bring her assailant to justice, and even though Patty's dad is a lawyer who is fully capable of filing all the papers and prosecuting justice, so to speak -- of taking the case, you might say.  But it doesn't work out, and it is both engrossing and enraging, and really great writing.    The bad -- after a few pages of reading the part of Freedom that is about this ordeal of Patty's rape case, it dawned on me that I had read it before!  I remembered the name \\"Ethan Post\\" , from a story in the New Yorker, and yep, it turns out that this segment of the novel had been lifted and excerpted for the Fiction section of the New Yorker a while back.  I don't even read the Fiction section much, but I always scan it, and on that one, I had found it fascinating and read every word of it!  It was that good.  The bad part is that the rest of the novel is nowhere NEAR that good.  Just no real spark to it.  So maybe it isn't a bad novel, maybe it's a real good novel, but being in the presence of --- juxtaposed with, so to speak --- it's own superlative chapter, it so suffered by comparison that it just didn't seem very good.  That's pretty faint praise, lemmetell ya.   Now, the Ugly --- If I had purchased the Kindle version I could have done a FIND for [Richard Katz] or even just [Richard].  So maybe I missed out on some kind of saving grace for this character, this dude.  But from what I read of him, he just kind of missed the mark.  Like I said, friends and acquaintances of mine noticed the similarity; and it could have been a portrait; but in my humble opinion it's just not a good job here, Jonathan.  I don't want to go into more than that, because it's just an opinion -- whether Richard Katz in the novel is a punk rocker is maybe only interesting to me, and to the general reading public it would only be interesting that he is a musician, and he plays loud.  I think what bugs me is that the Author doesn't actually use the words \\"punk rocker\\"; that kind of thing.  BUT bear in mind that he might get around to saying that, and I'll never know, because 1. I don't have the Kindle version and 2. I didn't actually finish the reading the whole book.    Let me finish up here with a comment on entertainment and reviewing:    If it's a movie, I'll tell people \\"This movie has this one scene that is soooo GREAT, you gotta go see this movie just to see that one scene, it's NOT to be missed.  A great scene, and you won't see it unless you go see the movie.  Not such a great movie, not even all that good, but you gotta see this one scene.\\"  And anybody who hears this wants to know what the scene is about, and you tell them, and invariably they'll go see that.  (Of course, every once in a while you come upon a movie, new or old, that is entirely composed of good-to-great scenes and of course that is a movie you recommend maybe even more strongly; High Plains Drifter comes to mind, and Ordinary People; and others.    But if it's a book, it doesn't work that way.  A good book is good all the way through.  That's just the way it is.  You sit down to read the book and boom, you get to the end, because it was good all the way through.  It was all, well, inspired!  Like one deep breath; the Author took one very very deep breath and wrote that book (and then edited it some :-))  I think you know what I mean here.    So Freedom by FRanzen, it seems like the Patty Berglund/Ethan Post story got monkey'd with along the way to becoming a novel, and there's a pretty good indication of what that process was in the character of Richard Katz. I'd be fascinated to have Franzen write a comment on this himself and say what the process was -- whether Patty's rape case was out of the newspaper, so to speak , ie it really happened pretty much the way it's related here fictionally; and then the novel grew out of that -- where I'm putting it aside and saying \\"this thing seems kind of cobbled together and I don't find it all that fascinating\\".    It's good enough, though.  And if you can get your hands on a copy of it easily enough, or if you can just do the one click thing with your unlimited budget and get your hands on a copy like I did, well, it's definitely worth getting if only to read the beginning - the middle - the end of the rape case.  (Of course if you have the Kindle version, just FIND [Ethan].)

B0041KKYEM|1.0|I was not prepared for all of the sexual intentions in the story line.  I think it took away from the content of the movie.  I fail to see why this movie won awards.  If I had known the way the story line was going....I would not have bought the movie.  This movie could have gone on a different route and it would have been much more interesting.  There was no suspense between the two women who were going after the part of the black swan other than sexual.  Truly disappointing.  NAC
0525951652|2.0|I was a bit disappointed in the condition of this book.  Pages were creased several times making it difficult to read.  Stains on them and stains on the bottom of all the pages when book was closed.
0307454541|1.0|I am compelled to write this review just to do my bit to lower the overall amount of stars given to this novel.<br /><br />There are two main stories. The case of the industrialist chasing our journalist hero is introduced in a tedious backstory that reads like the driest expose from a financial journal. Nothing then happens and we never actually meet the evil industrialist who is harassing the plucky little idealist magazine called Millennium. As the book was presented as part 1 of \\"Millennium trilogy\\" I assumed the story about the industrialist is the arc of the whole trilogy, only to be bored senseless by last hundred or so pages I skimmed, where the whole thing was clumsily wrapped up.<br /><br />The other story, the missing girl, was reasonably interesting based on the premise, but clumsily handled. There are so many pointless minor characters and diversions, I could not see the wood from the trees. I read this book very quickly and I am ashamed to say I did not see the conclusion coming. In my defence, this was because I was trying to work out how all the other pieces of endless information and implied importance of some people would fit into a single puzzle (the answer: they did't) and I rejected the obvious because surely, \\"it must be more complicated than that\\".<br /><br />The characters? Read through the other one star reviews, they have covered most of this. The idealised crusading journalist who is irresistible to women without doing anything to seduce or interest them, and the goth girl hacker straight from the wet dreams of a shy teenage boy (or a middle-aged journalist, as it may well be.)<br /><br />Larsson also seemed fascinated with computers, but could not see that any technical aspects he raves about are bound to be dated by the time the book hits the shops, and certainly by the time most people get around to reading it, and even if you know nothing about computers you would still find the listing of technical specifics ridiculous.
B0032KNA4I|2.0|Despite the effort on the special effects, this movie was bad. It almost shouldn't even be watched by people who love bad movies. The predictability of this movie plus its totally cheesy dialogue makes it almost intolerable.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.
B004SBX112|1.0|A worthy PURCHASE to add to my growing collection of games.  Definitely in the spirit of the original angry birds.

B003UESJH4|3.0|This movie was well-made and well-acted. Indeed it had everything except . . . a story.  I kept getting the feeling that whoever thought to make this movie was trying to make something out of nothing---i.e., take a few historical facts and create a story around it. The friendship between Logue and the King was not developed to the point that I really cared about it, so some moments that I gather should have been climactic (e.g., when the King insults Logue and walks off), really didn't matter so much. Also, I suppose I was waiting for the PYGLMALION moment, and I just didn't see that in the King's final radio address.  It was realistic in that way, I suppose, but it didn't make for those high moments that one comes to expect in a performance.
B000VWSINI|5.0|Eminem is simply amazing....amazing in every sense as a music artist. You get to see the different dimensions of him through this album, as with his other albums, and experience his genius through his rhymes, flow, and witty content. Those with a sense of humor, depth, and an appreciation for the art of rap will truly enjoy this album. You can feel his emotions through every line, and every song has its own theme and personality. His music is so unique and real. You MUST get this album. I got this album when it first came out (years and years ago), listened to it religiously, then didn't listen to it for years, picked it back up, and fell in love with him and this CD all over again. Now I always put it on repeat. Unlike other songs of our generation, Eminem raps about things that are relevant in our society- not just about petty love, money, and getting lots of women- but racism, war, violence, family, love and it's complexity, and much more.     Listening to him is definitely an experience.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Comment: I remember when this movie first came out... watching it at the local theater... and by the time it got to the \\"Light Ship\\" taking so long to cross the screen on a light beam, I almost couldn't keep my eyes open. That said I liked the movie immensely... especially the light cycles, that still have a slight edge on the new Light Cycles in the new movie, as far as action and display is concerned. For the time, the story plot seemed a little hard to follow... but as the years have gone by and people have \\"dissected\\" the story plot it is now abundantly clear. You definitely need to watch this movie before moving ahead to watch the new one. It is \\"sacrilege to do otherwise.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Excellent work - screenplay, acting, camera, everything. It was also interesting to see what it was like to be a mountain climber without all this fancy equipment that we now have. Be aware that the movie is in German with subtitles, although I personally prefer to watch all movies this way - with the original voices.
1597801585|4.0|It is an unexpected gift for a science fiction aficionado, used to expect a novel every 2 years from Neal Stephenson, now to expect a novel every 2 years from someone almost equally gifted.<br /><br />And what does this new writer with the funny name bring to the literary scene?<br /><br />First of all, along with a chosen few modern writers, he gives SF a good name, balancing with only his first novel many of the travesties of the 50s and 60s.<br /><br />Then, he brings us a dystopia, almost palpable. I mean, you can almost smell the dung of these megodonts, these 23rd century elephants, you can almost smell the stink of the city, and when the poreless Windup Girl wants an ice cube, you almost feel thirsty yourself.<br /><br />Furthermore, PB packs his action in a Dostoyefskian frame of time of a few months, giving us a pleasant break from the SF canon of decades, centuries or eons between chapters 1 and 2. But, unlike Dostoyefski, his heroes come in all shades of gray, and never in black, never in white. Long has one waited for a novel where there is no good guy, there is noone to root for from Page 1.<br /><br />And even though, one might protest about the sudden superwoman abilities of the Windup Girl, late in the novel, and one would even argue that the plot could have proceeded just as fine without these abilities, I consider this a minor flaw, along with a few clich&eacute;s, that will hopefully be missing from the writer's next endeavors.<br /><br />Benvenuto Paolo. We are waiting for more Dystopias.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|I watched documentaries in the past about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the conspirators and the aftermath. It was mentioned in the documentary that the one female hung was never truly found guilty of conspiracy. This is a brilliant telling of that story, and how it changed American justice and the actual future of her son when he was finally brought to justice. It also helped launch the viability of the Washington Post, as a lawyer of complete integrity found this his only remaining avenue to effect change in the young nation.

0141439580|1.0|Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.    Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.     Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.     In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\"

1439107955|5.0|If you are unable to decide whether the subject matter of this book might be too depressing, please do not hesitate.  This is a fascinating book filled with twists and turns, and really demystifies this disease.  It is uplifting in the sense that even though there has been much trial and error in the search for cancer treatments, this is ultimately a story of human triumph and discovery.  It takes cancer out of the shadows and shines light on this complex malady.  Mukherjee is a sublime writer, bringing science to life for those of us who have no background.  The book is really a historical thriller, and I could not put it down.  Highly recommend!

B003NRWW58|5.0|Often touted as the \\"darker/more adult\\" Doctor Who (which, to be fair, is more \\"family-friendly\\" than for children _per se_), Torchwood is arguably a different sort of show in its own right. The setting is Earth and the focus a group of humans grappling with the unknown in the form of a rift in space and time--situated right on Cardiff--that regularly spews forth all manner of alien species and technology. Originally formed by Queen Victoria as a counter to the supposed threat to the Earth represented by the Doctor and other alien life forms (and with an agenda of British imperialism above all else), Torchwood has since been reformed by Captain Jack Harkness in tribute to the Doctor's more humane, multicultural and egalitarian ideals.     Which doesn't make the ride an easy one for our protagonists--as one might imagine, with relative free reign (few even in the government are aware of Torchwood's purpose and existence) and powerful tech at their disposal, moral conundrums abound. The very first episode demonstrates the temptations of the job, as well as the moral and mental toll it can take upon fallible human beings.    In accordance with the show's opening narrated by Jack, that \\"the 21st century is when everything changes\\", expect your prejudices and beliefs to be somewhat challenged by this show. Moral ambiguity, hard choices and fluid sexuality abound (not entirely surprising for a show broadcast during the \\"watershed\\" time period for more adult fare). The Welsh setting adds colour and reminds us of the regular people and everyday routines of life being protected by Torchwood (and, I must admit, has caused me to fall a little bit in love with this part of the world).    To sum up, a somewhat darker offering than some Doctor Who watchers may be accustomed to. But like a good chiaroscuro painting, the moments of darkness make the moments of light stand out that much more--particularly through the character of PC Gwen Cooper, recruited in the first episode as much for her empathy and humanity as for her bravery and perseverance. Make no mistake, these are the \\"good guys\\", warts and all, putting their lives and sanity on the line for the sake of the human race.

If you're creating HTML for web sites then I recommend this book.<br /><br />I'm not a web site designer, but I've always tried to produce web sites that use valid HTML. And then when the current standard switched from HTML to XHTML I converted most of my web sites to the new standard. A couple of years ago, some friends started talking about HTML5 being a replacement for XHTML. I was tired of converting my web sites, so I pretty much ignored them.<br /><br />And then last year more and more people started talking about HTML5. It was obviously time to investigate further. And Mark Pilgrim's book seemed as good a place as any to start.<br /><br />It turns out that HTML5 is rather more than just a mark-up language. It's a term that encompasses a number of new technology standards that will be driving web application development for many years to come.<br /><br />Pilgrim explains all the new elements that are available in HTML5. Some of these, obviously, won't be supported by older browsers so, perhaps more importantly, he also covers how to detect which features are supported on a browser which is visiting your site. In each case, he explains the nuts and bolts of how it would be done, but then he also describes how it can be done far more easily using the Modernizr Javascript library.<br /><br />The most interesting new features to me are the native support for audio and video (although there is still some disagreement between browser makers as to which formats are supported) and the canvas element which will finally allow some powerful graphical effects to be produced in a manner which will work well across most (if not all) browsers.<br /><br />I haven't yet had a chance to really start using HTML5 on my web sites. But when I do, this is a book that I will return to frequently.
B00068ULLY|5.0|This dvd was like brand new! I'm very very happy!! Not a scratch and the box was in perfect condition! You would never know it was used! Perfect!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game!  It is good fun and makes you think.  I hope there is a sequel!  I got it before Amazon offered it for free, but it is definitely worth $1.00!
0316019984|5.0|I saw this book on a NBC \\"Today Show\\" segment, and knew right away it would be a perfect gift for my 4 year old godson!  I was right, he has yet to put the books down and his mom said he loves them! I got plenty of kisses for this gift!  So if you have small children in your life, I would recommend these vibrant colored POP-UP books!!
0141192488|3.0|There is no disputing the creative genius of D.H. Lawrence and Lady Chatterly's Lover is an icon of great storytelling and writing.  I think everything that can be said about it has been said.  However, I take issue with this Penguin Classics edition (2009)in just one regard.  The size of the book which apparently determined the typeface size.  It is a handsome and informative production and it seems a shame to have not been more generous with the overall size of the book and the size of the typeface. It is a detail that would possibly encourage more readers of all ages to discover or rediscover this splendid and beautiful story.
1563898586|5.0|This is one graphic novel that should be treasured by the readers, not just because of its deft story-telling, and epitome of steampunk adventures, but also because it acts as the teaser for so-many Victorian classics of literature, not only the English works by H.Rider Haggard, H.G. Wells, Bram Stoker, R.L. Stevenson, Herman Meliville, Arthur Conan Doyle, et.al, but also for its frequent referencing of (and cross-indcexing to) the incomparable Jules Verne. Highly recommended!
031261246X|5.0|I am giving the full 5 stars for the exceptional readability of this book; I just could not put it down. The characters are well developed and easy to understand and the story line is all too likely to actually happen in our world, making it even more exciting.  As a first book, Mark has done an outstanding job getting across technical material without confusing the audience or boring them.  Bravo!!! Can't wait to see what Mark has in store for the next book.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|You do realize this 4 box set is more than buying the books individually (8.99 x 4 = 35.96 as opposed to 35.99) Not much, but when buying a bundled product I expect there to be at least moderate savings.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This remake of the classic is an update to the original but is entertaining and endearing in its own right.  This compares well with the original but should be consideered on its own merits and a great family movie.
B004R15SIW|5.0|An excellent film that breaks the recent/current financial crisis down into terms commoners (such as ourselves) can clearly understand. Remember that New Order disc, 'Power, Corruption and Lies'? Well, that should be the subtitle of this film. Observing the nearly 30 years of institutional blindness exhibited by Allan Greenspan, plus the unmasked hypocrisy of economic academia and the blinding greed of those from wall street...was far more disturbing than watching any Rob Zombie movie. Much more.
B000QUEQBI|1.0|Received my dvd for \\"Shooter\\" and was looking forward to watching it....but sadly DVD would not play on any of my three DVD players which are all very new. What up!!!  Want to give it a zero \\"stars\\" but had to pick 1... Sent DVD back for a refund.  I will buy this movie somewhere else.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Well made documentary about natural gas and its environmental risks.  While the natural gas companies and their PR firms like to preach, \\"clean -safe- natural gas\\", this film shows that in the USA- where any type of regulatory function by the EPA or state environmental agencies is considered the foe of market capitalism- regulatory oversight is often not there.  Think the BP oil spill in the gulf- there was little-if any- prior safety inspections by the inspectors- so when the back up protection failed...oh well.    Fracking- the way natural gas it extracted-is achieved by pumping huge amounts of toxic chemicals mixed with huge amounts of water-into drill holes.  This waste water can and often has leaked-(contains both chemicals and gas)- into the water table and polluted resident's water.  The toxic chemicals used are often undisclosed by the gas companies -so residents are in the dark as what's being leaked into the water supply. Natural gas has also leaked into the resident's home water supply enabling residents to literally \\"ignite\\" their tap water using matches or lighters. The film shows example after example of this and is just plain creepy.    The film shows the insidious practices -driven by profit--being employed by the gas companies- sometimes resulting in polluting resident's home water.  When this has happened, the gas companies are forced to install large water tanks to replace the home tap water that had become toxic.  Nice.  Residents often must sign gag orders not to speak about these situations as part of settlement issues.  With a continued lack of regulatory oversight, frakking is  environmentally precarious for all Americans.     A definite watch- to educate Americans about the potential and high hazards of \\"clean - safe- natural gas.\\"

B004FOA84A|4.0|game was hard to start at first, it really makes you think! if you like crime csi type investigative stuff than this is worth it to download. foreclosed twice, but otherwise smooth running! beat it in two days though...wish there were different levels. i look forward to the next adventure! -droid2
081297381X|1.0|the title is the only substantial bit of text.     it's not even an original concept - taleb just borrowed it.     the book is an incoherent, self-indulgent and vacuous diatribe. there are a handful of potentially useful concepts, but they are not developed. not at all. not even the black swan. other reviewers praise his other book, but it has merit only in comparison with this one. both would benefit from heavy editing (which taleb understandably refused), but all that would be left would be the title. read that, and you've read the book.    better still, read the wikipedia article. that's actually well written, informative and properly edited.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent quality. All the series episodes. Great extras (especially the lunch with Joss in high def). Couldn`t recommend this series more highly.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|There are very few musical entities that consistently lead their genre album after album.  There are also few albums that I encourage people to buy rather than download for free.  Well, it is safe to say that the Foo Fighters have once again proven that they are the benchmark which many other bands in this genre seek to reach.  Wasting Light is an excellent album.  Some may even consider it a classic.  This album deserves to be purchased brand new due to its quality.      I do not predominately listen to alternative or rock.  I mainly stick to hip hop, however, I am never disappointed when I buy a Foo Fighters album and Wasting Light is no different.  If you like this genre of music at all you need to get this album and support real musicians that provide a quality product to their consumers.
0440213525|5.0|This was the first book that I read by Grisham.  It kept my interest every step of the way.  The legal information was easy to understand and limited enough to keep my interest.  Thanks, to everyone who recommended Grisham's novels!
B000000ZGO|5.0|This album is truly amazing. It's a groundbreaking album at least ten years ahead of it's time.   It's the prototype of the \\"Quiet Storm\\" style format. \\"Walk on By\\" is a soulful masterpiece,  \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\" is a heartbreaker of a song and very soulful.  And is there anything funkier then \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquadelamystic\\"?  This album definitely stands up to the test of time.
B000W07EKW|5.0|This collector's DVD box set is a rare find and a must have. Along with the bank safety box that contains the DVD trilogy it also has a cool passport of Jason Bourne that you see him use in the films. I'm glad I bought it.
B002TVQ4GW|3.0|This movie is ok to watch, but I wouldn't want to view it again. It moves to much all over the place, and gets a little confusing, to the point where it doesn't make much sense. it will leave you confused for awhile. The Blu-ray translation was really nice however. I would recommend it for a view, but not for a purchase, unless it is really really cheap. 2.75 out of 5
B003UESJHO|5.0|What is it about boxing movies that make them so good? I rolled my eyes when I first noticed the blurbs about this movie--here we go again--but when Melissa Leo got the Academy Award, I had to cave in and see this.    Firstly, it was far better than I thought it would be. I loved the portrayal of this low-end, blue-collar, Irish American, Suburban Boston family and its hilarious dysfunction and outright tacky behaviors. But Leo knocked it all (pun, unintended) out of the proverbial park!    Then there's Christian Bale--equally deserving of his Oscar--Bravo. I did not expect such an interesting study of family foibles, discord and all-so-human craziness. A vastly entertaining movie I would recommend highly!     Just proves that there really is something about boxing movies that is both uniquely American and utterly fascinating.
B004FOA84A|5.0|i liked it. got stuck really bad on the tub plug but kept reading hints online and finally got it. want more of these games!

0679805273|5.0|This book is my favorite Graduation gift.  I just ordered 7 books for High School graduates. I have given it as a High School gift for many years and I still love it.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I love dogs and think a dog as part of a family is great which is why I chose to read this.  Unfortunately this story was too boring, like real life.  I had a hard time staying interested and the racing references caused me to loose interest.  I definitely got emotional with the mother, father, and daughter relationship, but some points really dragged out - just like real life.
B003F3NDWG|2.0|I don't get it.  Unless all these glowing 5-Star reviews are from the friends and family of the actors on the show or are from network-studio shills, I have no idea what show these folks are watching.  This show isn't great.  It's not even good.  It's mediocre at best.  Every episode is basically the same--a whodunit with a person killed right off the bat and the police (and writer Castle) investigating the murder. There's minimal character development devoted to the main and supporting characters which may or may not have made the show more interesting.  The worse aspect of the show by far is the female lead, Detective Kate Beckett (actress Stana Katic).  I'm not sure she even qualifies as an \\"actress.\\"  She has zero range, zero charisma and zero sex appeal.  A cardboard cut-out might have done a better job in the role.  Consequently, there's NO romantic or sexual chemistry between her character, Beckett, and Castle (played by Nathan Fillion).  This lack of chemistry kills the show.  Fillion (who was great in \\"Firefly\\") does an okay job with his fairly listless and semi-goofy character.  As far as plausibility, it makes no sense that his famed writer character would CONTINUALLY go on investigations with the police.  Maybe once, but not thirty times!  I don't even think that would be legal.  He's basically acts like a cop on the show but isn't one.  Supporting characters (and actors) are all HUGE bores.  So little humor, very little romance, run-of-the-mill action and lifeless writing all add up to a pretty bad show, folks.  I got suckered into it by all the great reviews here.  Hope you don't make the same mistake.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Books 2 and 3 are one great book keeping the suspense and action going.  Always trying to guess what is next.
B000056H24|1.0|I'm sorry. If you are going to do any kind of movie on the life of Jesus, the actual son of God, then please read the book first. I don't know where they got the script, but it's not in the Bible.<br /><br />Yes, it is beautifully filmed. The lighting is superb. The camera work is masterful. Th locations are sometimes breathtaking. The cast is all-star even though the acting is as stiff as a pizza box, especially von Sydow's. The directing is hideous. This is worst than Sunday morning local church.<br /><br />Compared to [[ASIN:B0009UZG1O Ben-Hur]], [[ASIN:B001NSLE5I The Robe]], and even [[ASIN:B004IK30NW The Ten Commandments]], this movie is horrible. I'd much rather grab some popcorn and watch [[ASIN:B000KLQUS0 Facing The Giants]], [[ASIN:B001QTGLVG Fireproof]], or [[ASIN:B003NKU9AK Letters To God]]! I'd much rather have Biblical accuracy than art! Most people would too.<br /><br />So watch in on TV (if you can sit through it) during Easter weekend. But please, don't waste your money of this. One day, maybe, someone will produce a movie about Jesus that is actually taken from a script that someone wrote after actually reading and studying the Bible...and lots of prayer!
159420229X|3.0|I thought that the book was fairly interesting and entertaining.  I was disappointed in the lack of \\"how to\\" information.  While some memory-enhancing techniques were generally covered, I was disappointed in there being little detailed instruction.  I now know the generalities, but do not know how to employ the techniques mentioned.
0385341008|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Guernsey Literary And Potato Pie Peel Society.\\"  This is the story of the German occupation of the British Isle of Guernsey during WWII.  But it is so much more than the story of the occupation....it is the story of the inhabitants of Guernsey, told from a brilliantly humane perspective.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone, whether they be interested in WWII or not.  This is a book about people, their characters, actions and interactions.<br /><br />Loved it!
B000002IV8|5.0|First, I want to commend and recommend a great record store my wife and I visited on a recent trip to San Antonio, Texas, for those of you readers nearby or hopefully visit.  Hogwild Records is north of downtown on Main Ave - you can get addresses, phone numbers and other info at their Facebook page.  This place has a great metal and punk collection, the best catalog I've seen.  You can actually get older releases that aren't used copies of some timeless stuff and the crew there are great dudes.  I found a treasure trove of music there, and \\"I Hear Black\\" was among them.  I have many Overkill CD's already, and still lack a few for a complete collection, so I was thrilled to find this.<br />  Overkill is a great metal band because they are consistently smart, the music heavy, and Blitz Ellsworth's vocals always sharp and lyrics far smarter than most contemporaries.  So I'm a bit puzzled why some people consider this a weak or sold out effort.  Perhaps it's because they decided to go for the big riff this time around.  People sometimes forget metal can be varied, and when a band breaks out of an expected mold, it's taking a big creative chance because listeners are much less tolerant and anxious to slap every band into a very narrow category.  Overkill this time around recall some of the vibes of earlier heavy giants that wrote big hooks and still tore your head off.  I hear shades of Sabbath, with the always dependable D.D. Verni's bass mixed deeper and farther away from his usual trebly/metallic tone, which is a plus for me.  I like a bass that sounds like a bass.  Also, I can't help but be reminded of Nazareth, one of heavy rock's great underrated bands.  Anybody remember \\"Hair Of The Dog\\"?  If that wasn't a great hook, then what was?<br />  Blues also underscore great riff rock, and Overkill show they have an appreciation for older metal as well as staying fresh.  \\"Ignorance & Innocence\\" is one heavy tune, as is the lead track \\"Dreaming In Columbian\\" - love that title.  \\"I Hear Black\\" is a fine CD from their mid-career and Overkill fans checking out the back catalog shouldn't pay attention to the poor reviews.  It's not Overkill's fault some fans can't handle a little variety in their metal.  Their loss.umbian\\" - love that title.   \\"I Hear Black\\" is a fine CD from their mid-career and Overkill fans checking out the back catalog shouldn't pay attention to the poor reviews.

B00005K3O0|4.0|A suspenseful movie set in the 1970's, good acting.  The story was believable. It took a little long for the father to really believe in re-incarnation, especially when it involved his beloved daughter.  Anthony Hopkins gave a wonderful performance as always.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Few artists could match this album, which is release 2 years after her first album.  I love every song, which is rare these days.  She has a sultry heart-broken voice and she really makes you feel the pain and joy of being in love.  To be '21' and be able to express those emotions in the songs the way Adele does is amazing.  I can't wait til the next album.<br /><br />Enamored!!!!<br /><br />Chris Robinson

0060555661|5.0|I am only a short distance into this book so far. Although this text is long, the language is very readable. It is quite informative and uses data to backup concepts and positions taken. At this early stage, I am very pleased to be reading this and hopeful of finding actionable information as I proceed. There is no magic formula to investing here. The author discusses the requirement for hard fundamental assessment of each business investment. I loved the reference to investing in a business as though there was no stock market for trading.    Update: Halfway through this book and I wish that I had read it 30 years ago. I high recommend it for everyone who will have financial assets to manage. The author helps to manage our expectations of the markets, financial advisors, the differences between speculation and investing. That alone would have helped me to understand the flaws in the markets and how to deal with market crashes. This is a must, although slightly tedious, read.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|This production is an excellent adaptation to the screen of a dark, complex Dickens classic.  The acting is astonishingly good:  Tom Courtenay as Mr. Dorrit, Eddie Marsan as Pancks, and Sebastian Armesto as Sparkler are especially enjoyable, but everyone does a great job with a terrific script by Andrew Davies that is quite faithful to the novel. The pacing is fine, if a bit rushed in the final episode.    I do want to say that the world conveyed in this adaptation is no brightly-lit Jane Austen countryside: the brooding City of London and Marshalsea Prison loom large here.  There are pockets of goodness (and rewards for goodness) at work in this fictional world, but there is much pettiness and cruelty and devastating loss, as well, so be forewarned.
0307454541|5.0|I was a little hesitant to read the book because of the Swedish title &#34;Men Who Hate Women&#34;, and comments by other reviewers about brutal rape scenes.<br /><br />Actually, this is a terrific thriller which revolves around two great characters.  The violence is brutal, but brief and is not gratuitous.  There are three women-hating male characters, but they are minor characters who appear briefly and are not significantly developed.  &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; and numerous other great books are far more gruesome.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit leisurely.  It is obvious that many other reviewers who have grown up with video games, TV, and other forms of instant gratification lack the patience to fully appreciate the novel.  The same reviewers would have the same complaints about the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.  I greatly appreciate the time and details that allow me to become immersed in an unfamiliar world.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|At least, one thing you can say in favor of Inglourious Basterds is that it forces you to think, if you don't want to limit yourself to a merely instinctive judgment. The instinctive judgment would be that this movie is, overall, so profoundly silly and immature as to defy understanding and leave you with your head shaking in disbelief, something like a comic book from the sixties or seventies, aiming at a 10 to 14 mental-age comic book audience (and reading the reviews, there's a crowd of that out there), over-inflated to the size of a multi-million, over two-hour motion picture.  Silly and immature? Let's start with the big things. It all goes awry at the beginning of \\"Chapter 2\\", when Hitler appears portrayed as an eructating caricature - it reminded me of Terry Gilliam's Napoleon in \\"Time Bandits\\". And from that point you know that this is not going to be serious; even Chaplin's Dictator seemed like a stern documentary in comparison. Other glaring absurdities? A \\"Wild Bunch\\" of Jewish avengers wreaking terror behind enemy lines, and getting away with not even the trace of a scratch (at least before they team with a blundering Brit secret services agent). Tarantino's \\"Dirty Dozen\\" are even less than cardboard figures, you can hardly remember their names - and I'm not asking for psychological development, let's not place too high demands on Tarantino, just a little bit of description past a few grunts; even Schwarzenegger's bunch in Predator had more reality. A Jewish girl whom the Nazi Jew hunter lets escape from her family's massacre, then finding herself three or four years later (with fake identity papers, naturally, those came automatically with ration tickets in occupied France) the owner of a movie theatre in the center of Paris - with a black assistant and lover to boot. Hitler coming down to Paris - this is June 1944, after D-Day - just to watch a Goebbels propaganda movie (and was Goebbels ever a film director anyway? Not that I know of: as propaganda minister, he was a producer of films, but Tarantino lets the ambiguity hover). A German actress, double agent working for the allies, who knows about Hitler's coming to Paris, supposedly a top-secret information that only two other Nazi dignitaries including Goebbels seem to share. A Gestapo officer appropriately (and by sheer coincidence no doubt) present in a remote village tavern some miles away from Paris where no-one except British and American spies are supposed to be, clever enough to realize that the three German officers surrounding him are British and American spies in disguise (that's the afore-mentioned blundering Brit's blunder), but stupid enough to pull out his pistol and point it at the blundering Brit (what did he think the two others were going to do? just stare and keep sifting their whiskey?) instead of quietly leaving the premises as if he'd been aware of nothing, and then calling a squad to come an arrest or shoot down the lot. He should have asked me about spying techniques, I've watched enough movies to know these things. The German actress/double agent getting a bullet in her leg that you wonder how it didn't sever her tibial artery, and the next day she's up and kicking in a cast - no infection, no apparent fever, ah the miracles of make-up - after supposedly being repaired by what appears as a village bonesetter - and this is 1944 occupied France, remember, not \\"Emergency Room\\": reminds me of Schwarzenegger's \\"Last Action Hero\\" and his famous \\"just a flesh wound\\" - the ultimate film on action films, as referential on the history of cinema as any Tarantino movie and the reason why I'll always be friends with the former Governor of California, notwithstanding everything else. Three of the Jewish-American avengers think they have a chance of getting into the movie theatre where the premiere is taking place, passing off for Italians (a language none of them speaks), because \\"the Germans don't have a good ear for Italian accents\\". A guy gets three pistol bullets in the back at close range but still manages to survive a few more minutes to shoot back by surprise and kill his killer. A German sniper shooting down some 300 American soldiers from his Italian bell tower - why the Americans didn't send a tank destroy the tower, as the Germans did in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\",  is probably best explained by the fact that Tarantino's scene is presumably meant as a spoof of Spielberg's. Sure, at least an attempt at an explanation is provided in the \\"Goebbels film in the film\\" (supposedly depiciting the true story of the German war hero), \\"Nation's Pride\\", which is offered complete as a bonus feature: a humanistic US colonel refuses to be the one responsible for turning \\"1000-years history into dust\\", preferring to see 300 of his men shot; but, other than the fact that this can hardly be considered any more \\"rational\\" or credible than the rest (it might have been best not even trying to explain it), it seems also rather entirely inconsistent with the premise that this is supposed to be a Goebbels, anti-American propaganda film, so why would depict such a humanistic US colonel in such a positive light? Or maybe this is Tarantino's view of Goebbels' view of American Jewish-determined degeneracy: a degenerate soldier being (in the view of Goebbels as viewed by Tarantino) one who refuses to put to dust 1000-years history to save 300 men? Still, wouldn't it have been much more clever of Tarantino, and much more in-sync with what his film is about, to have made one of these oblique references he loves to make, here to  \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\" and its famous concluding motto: \\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\\". Meaning, the sniper never actually shot 300 GIs, they did blow down the tower and he managed to save his skin, running away. The rest is only Goebbels' propaganda film. Well, Tarantino didn't ask for my advice on his best script ever (see hereafter).  Oh, and, of course, the ending: Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and all the dignitaries of the Nazi regime being shot down and burnt down to flames in the Paris movie theatre. As we know, it didn't quite end that way.  And these are only the bigger absurdities. Let's move on to the small things, and back at the movie's beginning: a Jewish family being dairy farmers in the middle of nowhere in 1941 nazi-occupied France? The chief Nazi Jew-hunter coming all the way down to an isolated dairy farm in the middle of nowhere in 1941 Nazi-occupied France to hunt down a single Jewish family - and not the Rothschilds, mind you, just a nobody Jewish family of dairy farmers?? And - this one in fact even more outlandish than Hitler's portrayal, but with Tarantino there's not much difference between the big things and the small things - a (non-Jewish) dairy farmer in the middle of nowhere in 1941 nazi-occupied France speaking English????  Finally, the biggest absurdity of all, the one that strains to the extreme one's ability to voluntarily suspend one's disbelief: Brad Pitt with a Tennessee drawl. But at least this one is downright funny.  So: none of this can be taken seriously - at least if your mental development hasn't stopped at the age of 15, which I am not entirely sure is the case with Tarantino or his audience. And to think that he claimed it to be his best script to date - makes you shiver at the thought of what the worst ones might be. It is little more than \\"Sergeant Rock\\" made into a 70-million dollar motion picture.  Not that all of it is at that level of puerility, fortunately. There are a few nice scenes - starting with the opening cat and mouse confrontation between the SS Jew Hunter Hans Landa (Oscar winner Christoph Waltz) and the French dairy farmer Perrier Lapadite (Denis Menochet) - something like \\"Lapadite's Choice\\". Both actors are here exceptional, Landa in his cruel playfulness and Lapadite in his taciturn rock-like massiveness, until his break-down in tears. In fact, every appearance of Christoph Waltzis a good scene. Another one is when the rendez-vous between the spies at the remote village tavern goes awry because a gathering of German soldiers has unexpectedly chosen the same place to celebrate, and because, through the secret workings of Tarantino as the film's script-writer, the Gestapo officer has felt, that same evening, the compulsion to go precisely at that same tavern. Clearly Tarantino loves wracking the nerves of his audience with these contests of wits - will the good guys find a way to smoothly get rid of the bad guys or will it all skid into violence? In fact, one of the interesting underlying threads of Tarantino's movie - and it is I think a pattern in all his movies - is how things do NOT go according to plan. That pattern is also the main propellant of the final scene, the big movie showdown, which has a few nice turns to it - especially when the giant, ghost-like image of the Jewish girl's face hurling her imprecations at the Nazi dignitiaries appears against the smokes of the burning theatre.   But the script has more problems too than only the implausibilities, the improbabilities and the impossibilities. Take that first scene, for instance, the \\"Lapadite's Choice\\", at the end of which Hans Landa the Jew Hunter lets the Jewish girl, Shoshana, escape from the massacre of her family. In fact, when you reflect upon it, you realize that that scene bears very little relation to the rest of the film, it is just the idea that Tarantino had for a great scene that he didn't quite find a way to link to the rest of the movie, and the rest of the movie could have very well existed without that scene. When, some years later, Landa meets the same girl again, Tarantino makes very little of the encounter, and then leaves it at that.  Furthermore, Tarantino's apparent inability, or unwillingness, to choose a style/mood raises questions. The film starts like a psychological drama that Spielberg or Pakula could have filmed, then continues like a comic-book cardboard caricature or a film in the style of Jerry Lewis' \\"Which Way to the Front\\" (but with Tarantino's typical gory violence), and from there constantly veers back and forth, so that it leaves the audience never quite knowing on which foot to stand. And while I recognize that this apparent incapacity of choosing if this is going to be a serious, dramatic film or a mere spoof is probably a trademark of Tarantino's style, it is also, I feel, one of the film's problems. Maybe this way of playing cat and mouse with the public's expectations is a fine directorial trick in pure, \\"Pulp\\" fictions; but in a fiction like \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", taking place in a historical context, and one whose memory isn't erased (see the previous review), you can't so easily evacuate the historical facts as mere fiction. Hitler isn't Richard III, and Tarantino's \\"serious\\" scenes do not make his grotesque ones any less absurd and silly - on the contrary: they look even more jarringly silly. The two simply don't stick together.  But then, Tarantino's cinematographic culture is unquestionable - even if it seems rather undiscriminating, putting on an equal footing masterpiece and turkey. So one needs to go beyond the instinctive reactions, and give it a little more thought. What was Tarantino aiming at when turning a 70-cents comic book into a 70-million dollars film? Was he just doing that - a kid's mind in a star movie director's body able to toy with 70 million dollars and getting his shot at turning \\"Sergeant Rock\\" into a movie, period? If so, it is almost terrifying to think that Tarantino - and most of the critics, and most of the audience - have apparently seemed unable to give one thought to the fact that a motion picture is perhaps not just an animated cartoon, that there is a huge difference not just of medium but fundamentally of message between the 2-D, gaudy drawings and the 3-D, gaudy but hugely realistic motion picture. Godard once said something to the effect that a traveling is not so much a matter of technique as of ethics, and maybe Tarantino didn't quite get that part. To be quite honest, I didn't either before seeing Tarantino's film. Many have raved about Tarantino's \\"brilliant\\" camera work, and sure, it is often brilliant, imaginative, virtuosic. But if it is just a display of camera virtuosity - hey, see how I can impress you! - at the service of a void of purpose and thinking, then it is no less hollow and puerile than all the rest.  But maybe there is more to the film than only that, and I get my clue from the ending. Beyond and despite the portrayal caricatures and the huge credibility gaps, there can always be some pretense at realism as long as you don't depart from the more important historical facts: after all, Hitler didn't but COULD have come to Paris to see the premiere of a Goebbels movie, and after all there could have been a failed attempt to assassinate him, similar to Von Stauffenberg's in 1944. But when Tarantino stages the actual success of the Hitler-Goeebels-Goering assassination, and at the hands of three Jews and one Blackman, then you know you are totally out of reality. You are in a kid's fantasy-world where the lambs slaughter the wolves, where the oppressed eliminate the oppressors. And this is the kind of world that (only?) comics, or the movies, can create. So it is significant that the final showdown should take place precisely in a movie theatre. What is Tarantino telling us through the fact that the theatre is burnt down in flames with the throng of bad guys, burnt down from the inside and by its own propellant - the highly inflammable stock of nitrate films that was kept in the theatre? The editorial comment reminds us that Tarantino said at the Cannes Film Festival that he wanted to show Hitler defeated by cinema. But what he actually shows us is cinema destroyed along with Hitler.   In the contest of actors, Germany wins, hands down. Sure, as I mentioned, Martin Wuttke as Hitler is a caricature,but Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine is no less - oh the war seems so cool 'n easy with a guy like that - so that's a tie. The other American actors aren't given much scope by Tarantino to develop much of anything. On the other hand, while Christoph Waltz' performance has been showered with praise, and legitimately so, the equally brilliant performance of Sylvester Groth as Goebbels hasn't been commented upon enough. Diane Kruger as the German Actress/double agent is also quite good - and I can vouch that her French is so good (which even some traces of French accent when she speaks German, it seemed to me) that I first wondered why Tarantino had chosen a French actress to portray a German character.
0312427565|5.0|The book is a wonderful example of the need for the passage of time before a realistic assessment can be made of an event. Mr. Wolfe gives a very accurate portrayal of the 1950s and early 60s and how logic was thrown out the window in the pursuit of perceived Russian space dominance. Henry Luce, one of the founders of TIME, set LIFE magazine as the public relations arm of NASA and fabricated much of the astronauts lives for the sake of American boosterism. This does not take away from the fact that these gung-ho pioneers with very out-sized egos helped launch space exploration. Yet, it wasn't only the Original Seven who had swelled heads. Their wives, the engineers, the politicians, the scientists, the military test pilots and administrators are all caught up in heightening their stature. Mr. Wolfe does seem to enjoy ridiculing the dimwitted television press and posturing politicians (especially VP Lyndon Johnson.) Mr. Wolfe's work has a tendency to be overly dramatic (the guy's is waaaaaay too exclamation-point happy!!!!!!!!!!) with a sarcastic undertone. The author does an especially great job in describing the first three launches as well as Chuck Yeager's test flights with jets. The book grabbed me by the lapels and didn't let go until the very last page. A truly informative, entertaining story.

Hands down, the graphics are five stars.<br /><br />But everything else? I can only give it an \\"okay\\" unfortunately.<br /><br />THE PLOT: At least there WAS a plot. In the original \\"Tron,\\" I couldn't see a plot (but at the same time I wasn't really paying attention.) It was pretty basic and somewhat unoriginal (bad ruler, must destroy bad ruler), but easy to follow.<br /><br />THE ACTING: Garett Hetlund can somewhat act. I can sort of see some acting skils poking through, but a lot of the time, he sort of came off as a pubescent boy who's saying, \\"Look how cool I am. Do you see my awesome talent?\\"<br /><br />I liked Olivia Wild's acting overall and I liked Quorra's character. She was tough, but not one of those \\"kick-butt-without-a-heart\\" female characters. My only real complaint for her is that the wig looked sort of funny on her. It didn't come off obvious that she had one, but she looks better with brown hair. Maybe it looked funny because her eyebrows weren't the same color as her hair.<br /><br />Between Sam and Quorra, I appreciated that there was barely any romance. I like just a little bit of romance sprinkled in a film (or book), but this didn't have any. It also didn't have one of those start-out-fighting-end-up-in-love relationships (which is starting to get very overused.)<br /><br />Jeff Bridges played a good Clu/Kevin Flynn.<br /><br />The Sirens (for the short time that they're in it) were awesome.

B004FOA84A|3.0|I really enjoyed this game, but was a bit disappointed when I couldn't solve the last puzzle...that is, I solved it, but the game won't trigger the ending. The game force closes on launch fairly often, but retrying a few times always fixed it. Other than that, it was a good time. I'd compare it to some of the better flash puzzle games out there. It's pretty buggy for a paid app, but as long as you can play through it, it's fun.

B002KS1IJC|5.0|Having seen too many movies lately that had the wrong ending, I was very happy that this one turned out right!  The story was great and a good twist on the 'normal' plot elements.  I thought the special effects were very good, and I'm usually extremely fussy.  The dialog was some of the best I've heard in a while, and the jokes were genuinely funny!    Can we have more movies like this one?

They are light; I can wear them while running, crossfit, or any other intense workout. These suckers stay in place. I highly recommend if you do not like earbuds. They are inexpensive too w/ great sound quality and durability. It took me several years to go thru multiple pairs of these and that was travelling overseas w/ them. Highly recommend!

0307887960|5.0|I have read a lot of these reviews, mainly from people who have only read the book, not actually tried the program for any substantial length of time.  I read about this program in an online article, purchased the book from the Amazon UK site, and began last year (2010) in April.  I have completed the first 2 phases, and am currently in the third.      I lost 50lbs on this program.  I reached my goal weight last November, and have maintained the weight loss even with many eating stumbles all along the way.  In my current Consolidation phase I eat from every single food group, enjoy weekly celebration meals of whatever I want, and am never hungry.  I have maintained even with being sick over the last few months (thanks to my children bringing home every germ imaginable from school) and therefore not being able to exercise.    Everyone is trying to compare this diet to others.  Yes, it has similarities to other programs, but the structure and methods are unique.  Please, if you are serious about losing weight and becoming healthy you should give this program an honest effort.  Then come back here and review the book.  I speak from actual experience and this is the easiest and most successful I have ever been with any weight loss program.  The caveat-different diet structures work for different people.  Wishing you dieting success!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|John Fox has excelled.  Watch this film to become educated on the perils of hydraulic fracturing.  This is a process where TOXIC, CARCINOGENIC CHEMICALS ARE INJECTED INTO THE GROUND to release natural gas.   It is dangerous business - so much that New York State has placed a moratorium on \\"fracking\\" until a study is completed.  In Pa., where fracking is rampant in the \\"Marcellus Shale\\", household water wells have become contaminated due to the fracking process.  What do you do with a house without water?    Unfortunately in Pa., we have a governor (Corbett) who has taken over $1 million  in campaign contributions from the natural gas companies.  Guess where his loyalties lie?  Recently, Pa. had a \\"blowout\\" of a gas well, releasing toxic frack fluid over farms, land and a stream that flows into the Susquehanna River.  It wasn't the first fracking disaster and it certainly won't be the last.  If you find yourself in a situation where gas companies want you to lease your land for fracking, think long and hard.  Fracking causes water pollution, air pollution and health problems too numerous to mention.
1400032717|5.0|I read more than twenty books a year, and this is one of the best books I've read in the last five years.      It is clever, poignant and rich with detail.  We, as readers, understand what is happening before our protagonist, and we wonder how he'll cope when he learns certain truths.  We follow him on his journey (both figuratively and literally) and hope him safety with both.      We see the world through a unique set of eyes in this book.  Two eyes.  And two is a prime number.  These details, ones that are typically deemed unimportant, become the centerpiece to understand how our young lad's history unfolds before him.      I read this book in two sittings, and I would have finished it in one if I didn't have somewhere else I needed to be.  The read is easy, but the layers of understanding are many.  I highly recommend this book to a reader of any level.  There is something for everyone.

0393338959|5.0|Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 Nobel prize winning Economist, makes a very powerful case of how the Wall Street took the main street for a ride while the regulators turned a blind eye while the housing bubble was growing. While the avarice of the few held the whole country, and eventually the whole world to a ransom. The unrepentant perpetuators were eventually bailed out by the government, the same government which is an anathema to their business while in good times. The ungrateful then brushed off the whole disaster as a statistical event which no one could have foreseen, and patted themselves on their back and rewarded themselves lavishly. And back to business as usual. In the following paragraphs I have selected a few key thoughts which I found to be very profound and very insightful.    Markets lie at the heart of every successful economy, but markets do not work well on their own. It is in tradition of Keynes. America's financial markets failed to perform their essential societal functions of managing risk, allocating capital, and mobilizing savings while keeping transaction costs low. Instead they created risk, misallocated capital, and encouraged excessive indebtedness while imposing high transaction costs.     The reason why the Banks are regulated is that their failure can cause harm to rest of the economy. A country in which socialism is often treated as an anathema, has socialized risk and intervened in the markets in unprecedented ways.     Securitization of mortgages created asymmetries. The buyer of the security typically knew less about the borrowers than the Bank or the firm that had originated the mortgage. Because the originator did not bear the consequences of the mistakes, the incentives for doing a good job at credit assessment were greatly attenuated. Globalization had opened up a whole world of fools; many investors abroad did not understand America's peculiar mortgage market, especially the idea of non recourse mortgages (where the borrower canjust turn his or her keys over to the creditor with no further consequences). Originators gave away lot of money to many unworthy borrowers, throwing caution to the winds, and sold the rotten apples to the Investment Bankers, who were lot more sophisticated than gullible. The mortgage originators made their money in form of huge fees (what Stiglitz calls as high transaction costs).    Investment Bankers just peddled the rotten apples, with the collusion of the rating agencies, to investors all over the world. The rating agencies did badly because they used the same bad models that the investment bankers used. They assumed that the housing prices will never decline. Another assumption was that the foreclosures in different parts of the country are not correlated. In the greed that gripped the nation, there were no holds barred-including exploiting the weakest in our society. Wall Street had used its power & money to buy deregulation. Too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-resolve, or too-big-to-manage banks are too-big-to-ignore campaign contributors.      This contrasts with the traditional situations where Banks with a long-standing relation with the community had an incentive to treat borrowers who got into trouble well; if there was a good chance that borrowers would catch up on their payments if they were given some time, then the bank would give them the time they needed. But the distant holders of the mortgages had no interest in the community and no concern about having a reputation as a good lender. Securitization made re-negotiating of mortgages difficult.     Stiglitz argues that the best option for the country is to lower the principal, not just stretching out the repayment timeline for extended fees. No one gains from forcing homeowners from their homes. Foreclosures lower the prices of other homes in the neighborhood. Thereby increasing the chances of those other homes going into foreclosure. In 2005 President Bush passed a law making it difficult for homeowners to declare bankruptcy. Banks have since then opposed repealing this law.     Stiglitz refutes the argument that lower taxes and deregulation is the mantra. He gives the example of Sweden which has one of the highest per capita income and higher life spans, but has higher tax rates. On the contrary, the financial debacle was a private sector led mis-allocation of resources on a massive scale, aided by deregulation. He states that Capitalism cannot work if private rewards are unrelated to social returns.    Stiglitz contrasts the solutions used by US during the crisis with whatever the western countries were lecturing the rest of the world a decade earlier during the Asian crisis. To pull US out of the hole, the country engaged in massive increases in spending and massive deficits, even as interest rates were brought down to zero. Banks were bailed out. These are counter cyclical monetary & fiscal policies. But developing countries were forced to follow pro-cyclical policies a decade back, i.e. cutting expenditures, raising taxes and interest rates.     Stiglitz refuses to believe the story that the Fed could not do anything to prevent the cirsis. Fed underestimated the extent of correlation between different housing markets, and overestimated the diversification of risk. It underestimated the incentives for excessive risk taking and overestimated the competence of the bankers at risk management. He states that the Fed could have raised margin requirements. In 1994, Congress gave Fed the powers to regulate the mortgage market, but Greenspan refused to use it. Fed could have reduced the loan to value ratios as the likelihood of a bubble increased. It could have lowered the maximum house payment to income ratios. It could have restricted variable rate mortgages. It could have restricted negative amortization and low-documentation loans.     He concludes by giving an example of how a failed CEO would react in different cultures. The failed CEO would commit harikari (suicide) in Japan. In UK, the CEO would resign. In US, the CEO would stay on and fight shamelessly for more bonus.    The Nobel Prize winning Economist, very strongly, more than adequately, and eloquently, made his point.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is polished and fun, but it's also so short that you'll be finished with it in an hour or less, and it's got no replay value at all. In short, it's worth its price and it will keep you entertained for a short time, but won't last you long.
B004XO3Z92|5.0|This teaser is effective. It's hard to wait for \\"shortly after the premiere\\" when the first episode of season 6 will be available on Amazon. As it's Easter weekend my one friend with BBC America is out of town so Amazon is my only hope. I had hoped \\"shortly after the premiere\\" would mean shortly after 10pm in the UK, alas it did not. Neither did it mean shortly after the US premiere, in any US time zone.
0439023513|5.0|I've had this series on my to be read list for a while and I'm sorry I waited so long. The first two books were amazing and this was a fitting - if not altogether comfortable - ending. I know many readers had mixed feelings about the darkness of the book and the way Katniss emotionally falls apart throughout several parts in the books, but I keep going back to this simple fact - she is 17. She's seen and done some pretty horrific things (starting even before the Hunger Games, with her father's death and having to support her family) and at some point it's going to take it's toll.     Also, I haven't read through all the reviews, but of the ones I have read, I haven't heard anyone mention her mother. Her mother definitely showed signs of deep depression after her father died and I definitely think those genes came to manifest in their own way in Katniss through all the tragedy.     SPOILER:  I also loved the bit of happiness shown at the end with Katniss and Peeta. I think the way Collins described why Peeta was the right one for Katniss was spot on. While I would have liked a little more about Gale and what he went on to do, I think Mockingjay showed repeatedly why he and Katniss had grown apart.
B0039ZF8D2|4.0|Nas' verses are good, of course. But, there was a bit too much Reggae for my taste. I was expexting Nas to spits the verses and Damian to sing the hooks. Not hating on Reggae, but I'm not really a fan, and while Reggae definitely has it's place in hip hop music (as does R&B) as a hip hop fan it would've sounded better if they kept Damian strictly on the hooks.
0439023521|5.0|I am not going to rehash the plot as many reviewers have already done, but this series is amazing and NOT TO BE MISSED. The premise is original and the writing is fast paced. I loved the characters and felt for each of them with every page turned.     There have been off/on comparisons with this series and Twilight and Harry Potter, but (having read all three) I can honestly say this stands apart and is totally original.

This book has great background knowledge as well as pictures of behind the scenes plus cast photos.

This book is made very well and is has a really cool thick puffy outside.

B000F1IQNM|2.0|NANNY MCPHEE is Colin Firth's and Emma Thompson's misfired attempt to bring MARY POPPINS into the 21st Century. Without mincing words, it doesn't work.<br /><br />Firth, an Undertaker (how cheery for children!) who is under pressure to remarry in order to claim a much-needed inheritance, is the recently widowered parent of seven motherless children, a la THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  They are under the common impression that Nannies are cruel and foolish and stepmothers are all evil, and are dedicated to driving away every Nanny and would-be stepmother in the world. They have a soft spot for the housemaid Evangeline who eventually becomes their father's love interest.<br /><br />At first, their pranks make them endearing, as when they fool their latest Nanny into thinking they've eaten their baby sister, but the film doesn't progress very far before they become simply and unbearably rude and obnoxious in a way and to a degree that middle class English children of the Victorian Age would never have been. Fifty years after MARY POPPINS we've apparently forgotten what the values of that era were.<br /><br />Enter Nanny McPhee (Thompson), a frightening wart-nosed, snaggle-toothed magic Nanny, essentially Mary Poppins' \\"black swan.\\" Where Poppins is stern, McPhee is mean; where Poppins is mysterious, McPhee is scary; where Poppins is kindly yet firm, McPhee is commanding and domineering. The children listen to Mary Poppins because they come to respect and to love her. The children listen to McPhee because they come to respect and to fear her.<br /><br />Even though Nanny McPhee's ugliness recedes as the children's behavior improves, the film, in adopting a pragmatic approach to the use of lies, has odd ethics and a curious lack of heart. That lack of heart guarantees that NANNY MCPHEE will never become a classic.<br /><br />MARY POPPINS was the first movie my mother ever took me to see back in 1964, and I happily remembered so much of it. NANNY MCPHEE would have had me cowering under my seat, scared to go to sleep at night. Far better to turn to Julie Andrews' memorable and musical performances than to this frenetic and vicious reimagining. Yet again, in our time cruelty seems to substitute for comedy and humiliation for entertainment.night.

B000TNF7NS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album!! This is easily UFO's best player bar none as all of the songs are of equal measure and do not disappoint. Leo Lyons is again at the helm of this recording and Chick Churchill guests on keyboards to add some texture and substance to a few numbers like Out in the Street, Let it Roll and This Kid's. The obvious focal point is Michael Schenker's invigorating performances on all the tracks offered here. Check out his guitar lines on numbers like Let it Roll, Shoot Shoot, Love Lost Love and This Kid's; he is young, growing and hungry for being the absolute best he can be as an aspiring musician and guitar hero. Andy Parker is also a perfect drummer here as he propels songs like Out in the Street, Let It Roll and Too much of Nothing into awesome powers of rhythm consistency and providing the heartbeat to this bonafide UFO engine. Phil Mogg's vocals are maturing here and becoming more styled with his assurance of voicing and sense of melody, whilst all the more creating an uncanny original frontman's identity. He wasn't Ozzy or Robert Plant or Mick Jagger; no, the closest comparison would be to that of Paul Rodgers.     I really enjoyed Phenomenon as a first effort with Schenker as it opened up so many new sounds and ways to further the future of rock guitar for its time, and Force It happily surpasses that optimism and is of even better quality overall in performance, songwriting and execution for this group. Of Course, alot of people will point to Lights Out and Obsession, but Force It is really where the heart of UFO lies. Oh yeah, the remaster has been a long time coming as well!! It's about time someone took the initiative in updating this and the rest of the back catalogue to give a better sonic quality within the digital age. Bravo!!!

B004GIPCU0|4.0|The Palit GTX460 1gb video card has a very unique shape and design, so there aren't many coolers that will fit on it. This cooler fits perfectly, and comes with plenty of VRAM heatsinks that fit and stick like glue. The card comes with a fan controller, which is a plus. Even when setting the fan speed to low, my card's temperature stayed under 55c during gaming load, a dramatic improvement compared to the stock cooler. Most importantly, the fan is very quiet and does not produce any whiny noises.      There are a few issues however:    1. Once this cooler is installed, the side-mounted fan on the Antec 900 case will no longer fit.  2. The fan controller knob on this cooler is a bit too big and therefore will not fit through any of the back slots of the Antec 900 case.  3. The installation is very tricky, and the instructions manual could be better.      Overall I am satisfied with the product, as it is only $45 and it's pretty much the only cooler that will properly fit on the Palit GTX460 1GB model while providing more than enough VRAM heatsinks.    Be very careful if you are installing this onto a Palit GTX460 1gb, as the instructions are not made specifically to be installed on this model. Installing wrong parts & pieces in wrong positions could short your video card!
B004W5T2RG|2.0|I like country music. I like Gwenyth Paltrow. I like girl movies. But this really stank it up. How is it possible that something with so (very) much treachery, tears, music, and sexual tension could be so boring?

159420229X|5.0|If you're like me and get to the top of the stairs not remembering why you bothered to expend the energy then any clue as to how to improve your memory might be of interest.  This is an excellent piece of reportage being engaging, informative, educational but above all entertaining. Foer chronicles the development of memory techniques from ancient times and, though not a comprehensive history, nevertheless, selects his anecdotal evidence well.  I certainly do not have any inclination to enter competitions to pit my memory against those who, the book details, devote most of their life to comitting vast tracts of knowledge to memory in addition to mastering those techniques that enable that process. However, I do now have several techniques that will allow me, if I so desire, to go the shops without necessarily having to make a list.  Sure a pen and paper are usually freely available but you never know when you might need to retain important information in extremis!    And, if like this you might also enjoy 'Angry White Pyjamas' by Robert Twigger and 'Will Storr vs the Supernatural' by, oddly enough, Will Storr, both also excellent and entertaining pieces of reportage.
0470876417|4.0|This book is getting buzz in the startup community these days.  I read through it a week or so ago, and it is a useful addition to the entrepreneur's library.    The book has five major sections.  In the first, the authors introduce their notion of a business model canvas broken down into nine constituent parts.  Some of these parts are obvious things that anyone trying to think about a business model would examine such as customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships and revenue streams.  The canvas adds in the other pieces (key resources, key activities, key partnerships and cost structure) and adds an organizational overlay that lends itself to analysis.  The second major section takes a look at five different business models and fits them into the canvas.  The third section, called \\"Design,\\" describes various techniques such as visual thinking, ideation and prototyping, \\"that can help you design better and more innovative business models.\\"  The Strategy section then takes the earlier concepts and combines them with other strategic approaches such as SWOT analysis and Blue Ocean strategies in order to determine where opportunities for improving models may lie.  In the final major section, \\"Process,\\" the authors lay out a roadmap for running a business model design initiative.    Note that much of the book relies heavily on concepts and work originated by others.  This is actually a great strength since it pulls together a lot of different theories and presents them in an easily digested form.  The writing is accessible, and it may be that many of the concepts are more easily absorbed here than in the original source materials (all of which are conveniently referenced in case you want to explore further).      The notion of the canvas is new, and it does have an organizational elegance about it that is appealing.  One of the points in the first section is that the first five constituent parts of a business model are all about value, whereas the final four are all about efficiency.  This makes it easy to see why it made sense for Amazon to unbundle its businesses into an e-commerce line and an IT infrastructure management line.    Aside from a few styling miscues (tiny white print on a black background on some of the pages, really), the major complaint about the book from me -- and many others -- is that it lacks depth.  Most of the case studies are short and the answers are dished up without consideration of the iterations that must have been required to get there.  This book is trying to present a generalized way of looking at business models -- and I would say that it succeeds very well at that task -- but nothing beats seeing the concepts applied in real time rather than in retrospect.  For people that are interested in seeing the canvas in action, I highly recommend reading about the Lean Launchpad project at Stanford on Steve Blank's blog.  Think about it as an advanced class after you read the book in the introductory class.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a long time. Christina was amazing. From the start of the movie you actually forget that it's Christina playing the roll of Ali. The viewer forms a strong friendship with Ali right from the start. Cher brings the house down, not only with her acting but her powerful ballad that deserved to win the Golden Globe and hit #1 on the dance chart. You really get to know Tess and want desperately for her to keep the club and make it the biggest attraction in Hollywood. All the characters interact splendidly. Especially Tess and Shawn and Tess and Ali. The way Ali and Jack's relationship grows is compelling. The dancing was beautiful as well as the directing and writing. Over all the movie was just down right amazing. Everyone I have recommended to see it (men and women) have said that they loved the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, seriously what are you waiting for?

B0000UJDLM|4.0|When I go back to a cute movie I saw years ago, it often turns out that being nostalgic for it was better than seeing it again. Then there are movies like this one, where re-seeing really does stand up to the memory.<br /><br />Sort of a modern-day Pinocchio story, the little metal boy turns real - real enough, at least, even if he stays little and metal. Maybe even real enough to get a kid to think about what it means to be a person with feelings, even if that person looks different. The self-aware robot's history as a piece of military hardware provides plenty of adventure, but it stays safe enough for all but the most skittish young'uns.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the robot is cute, too. The film's makers specifically wanted to avoid anything that looked like a person might be inside, and succeeded beautifully. They came up with a wonderfully expressive gadget, sort of a marionette but with inivisible electronic controls instead of actual strings or wires. The result is a nice piece of technology, but with a real personality.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Batteries Not Included\\" (and I did very much), give this one a shot. It's fun.<br /><br />-- wirdweird
B00003CWRX|1.0|As a previous reviewer said, \\"it never picks up\\".  I kept wondering when something would happen or whether I had blacked out and missed key scenes.  I regretted watching it more than wasting money on it.  I mean, it was a little like torture.  One scene goes on and on showing a string of cars moving down the street.  Characters go this way and then that way, on and off the phone, or in and out of cars.  Pare all the fluff away and there might be a movie in there somewhere.        The volume and background music is erractic and intrusive.  I would rather hear a kennel full of barking dogs, a nursery full of crying babies, or a beeping street sweeper, than this movie's soundtrack.  The same song erupts randomly throughout the film, perhaps to increase the drama where none existed in the first place.      One of the few shining lights in this movie is Christoper Plummer.  He was brilliant as Dan Rather.  Pacino was Pacino, Crowe was Crowe, and most of the actors, forgettable.      This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and amazed it was nominated for best picture.
B00005JNS0|4.0|No doubt, there are great animations coming from lots of production companies these days. Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors. Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.<br /><br />The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends. But, as with any familiar recipe, it's easy to enjoy yet another preparation of it if done well. Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life. Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself. When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do. From Doc, to Lightning, to Sally, to Mater (get it? \\"to mater\\"?), to the tractors, each comes across as a unique individual. It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.<br /><br />Too bad I missed this when it first came out. It's held up well, though, and will remain enjoyable for years to come. And no, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B000V698WE|2.0|I listen to a pretty wide variety of music, very little of which is pop (of which almost none is mainstream pop). I can appreciate a wide variety of musical tastes and textures, but John Coltrane's A Love Supreme leaves me feeling worn out. I've listened to it probably over 20 times (stubbornness, I guess), and my favorite part is where I turn it off. Why give it two stars instead of one? Well, I freely admit there are good pieces of music interwoven into the composition, but it makes me feel exhausted trying to exhume them from the mess of saxophone noodling and screeching. It seriously gives me a headache after most listens, and I listen to other plenty of musical pieces known to inflict headaches (Mars Volta, or  for instance). I also appreciate musicians like Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, and Jimi Hendrix, and Steve Vai, all known to noodle around in their own right. Personally, I've concluded this is considered a jazz classic solely because the man was so far off of the mainstream that the jazz junkies of the day could listen contentedly knowing that no one else would appreciate their \\"music\\". If you're looking for something \\"different\\", you might consider this album, but if you want something \\"good\\" then steer clear.
0446691437|5.0|I consumed this book ravenously in about three sittings. Pressfield ties our personal struggle to be authentic to our calling into something that transcends advice or even insight. Diagnosis, prescription, sacred text and benediction. All in one book.     By half way through the book I knew that I wanted to give a copy of it to my daughter who is struggling to take her own self and talents seriously.    One note, I found the Foreward by Robert McKee completely unworthy of Pressfield's writing. Ironically, McKee writes in a trite ego-centric style. Fortunately I don't read forewards first and I may just rip those pages out of the book before I give it to my daughter.
B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|I love action films and I love the actor Eric Bana from the movie Munich. Hanna is a very good movie filled with great action and good characterizations. You feel like you really get to know the people, a rarity in action films.<br /><br />Eric Bana raises Hanna in a remote area of Finland where he trains her to be a ninja warrior of the fiercest and quickest kind. He has her on the alert even while she is sleeping. She knows that her mother died, \\"shot be three bullets\\" but knows little else about her life. As she learns more about who she is and what she is, she begins an existential crisis.<br /><br />Eric Bana tells Hanna that when she is ready, she should press a button on the CB radio in their Finnish cottage and people will know where they are. It is then her responsibility to kill the woman played by Cate Blanchett or be killed by her. Hanna goes out on her own and has one adventure after another. They are poignant, heartwarming, adrenaline rushing, and edge of your seat action scenes. Hanna plays the part of a warrior/idiot savant brilliantly. She can recite facts about most anything but knows little or nothing about human emotion.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the movie. I don't know the name of the actress who plays Hanna, but she is great. She played Brioney in Atonement.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I still have the original VHS versions of these episodes, as I want to see the original theatrical versions. I was a freshman in college when episode IV came out. It was brilliant! Why screw with perfection. My current TV upscales the video, so it's better than watching on an old CRT. The only enhancements that are required are digital video / audio. DON't SCREW W/ THE CONTENT!

B000005YZM|3.0|While this is a competent album of 3 minute psych pop, when considering all the other greats and unknowns from the era, it seems to me rather overrated. The production is good for the era and the vocal harmonies are impressive, but it's nothing earth-shattering. It's certainly not at the level of the 60s classics from the same period we all know and love, and I can think of plenty of music from relative unknowns from the same year like Andwella's Dream, Aphrodite's Child, Tuesday's Children, Mirage, July, Blossom Toes which I'd take over this. I write this review neither to irritate fans of the album nor to collect brownie points, but rather to warn any prospective buyers not to be swayed by all the positive reviews into automatically thinking this album is a must-have.
1400052181|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book. It combines a spellbinding family story with explanations of highly technical scientific subjects in language that the layperson can understand. It also deals with the still controversial subject of the extent of control that individuals should have over research using tissues taken from their bodies in a fair and balanced way. This was the first book that I ordered using my new Kindle, and I found it very difficult to put down.

I definately think that this is the best song I've heard this year. It sounds so addicting and cute. When I heard Born This Way, I was a bit apprehensive of the musical direction of what Gaga was heading onto, but after listening to Judas it quickly put me on ease! Whew!

B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|\\"Hanna\\" is a ruthless, relentless, chase featuring a teen girl assassin. It's violent and suspenseful, fast and cruel. The chase sprawls over travelogue settings in the Arctic Circle, North Africa, and Berlin. It's like the Bourne movies, like Daniel Craig's Bond movies. The difference is, of course, that the hero is not a muscle-bound adult male, but a barely muscled teenage girl, Saorise Ronan. And the focus never waivers from the chase. Hanna gets no love interest.<br /><br />I generally don't go to movies I know are going to be violent and I have walked out of violent films, but I loved \\"Hanna\\" and kept my eyes open throughout almost all of it. It's not just that Hanna, the assassin, is a girl, and I'm female, too, although that was part of it. \\"Hanna\\" depicts Hanna as having an admirable work ethic, and as being an underdog. The one thing that separates her from the people she so determinedly wounds, beats, stabs, and kills is that she is just following the pedagogical training of her admirably dedicated, old-school patriarch, Erik (Eric Bana.) Erik raised his girl to know how to read, write, and kill. He did this for a righteous reason. The people Erik trained Hanna to kill are very, very bad people, and the audience wants them dead, as well. The morality and worldview of \\"Hanna\\" is very much that of the setting of its opening scene: the harsh north. This is Nordic morality, where even if you do the right thing, you may end up dead, anyway. There is no reward. If you don't end up dead, and live on, you live on only to keep fighting in a harsh, unforgiving landscape.<br /><br />Saorise Ronan gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Hanna. She truly inhabits a character whose sole focus is on struggle. She enters every new landscape, from a treeless desert to a hotel room, with the focus of a wild animal: where is the food? Where is something to drink? From what direction will danger come? How will I meet it? Ronan never once slips up, never once behaves as a comfortable teenage girl would behave. She has a killer's eyes throughout the entire film. I have to wonder if this wasn't a tough film for her to make. Playing Hanna would have given me nightmares.<br /><br />The film's ruthlessness becomes a bit of a failing. The film is so ready to wound and kill characters the audience wants to like, so ready to turn sweet moments into deadly poison, so ready to let any landscape become a death trap, that I did get a bit jaded about 75% into the film. I was no longer surprised when a character showed some humanity only to be dispatched in the most hateful of ways. But the film threw some new plot developments in at that point, and it kept my interest.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is terrific as Hanna's foil. Eric Bana is solid as her dedicated teacher and father. The supporting cast, including Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams, is all very good.<br /><br />The Chemical Brothers' soundtrack is perfect. I often don't even hear soundtracks the first time I watch a movie, and when I do notice them, it is, all too often, because they are intrusive and trying to do the work of wrenching emotions that poor filmmaking could not do.

B000F3AJUS|5.0|No doubt there are people who love, and hate this particular album. I'd like to preface by saying I have not paid much attention to the CD, the 180g vinyl copy is where it's at. Granted this may not be as stylistally diverse as older Steely Dan albums, although I love this album. What blows me away is the purity of the sound quality. You need one of two things to enjoy this thoroughly- either a high end set of loudspeakers, may I suggest Klipsch Cornwalls, or a great pair of headphones (the stereo itself and turn table are required components- don't settle for Sony boys and girls). The highs and lows are so clear; I love watching the analogue needles bounce on my MC 2205 amp. Long live vinyl.
0142437611|3.0|A day in the life of a loser.<br />Considering that the day holds the life history of the last 25 years, this 1955 novella is rather action packed. Bellow obviously needed a breath of fresh air after the endless (and to me disappointing) Augie March. So he went for the often satisfactory novella form rather than the shapelessness of his fat novel.<br /><br />The loser is Wilky Adler, a fair-haired hippopotamus in his own words, now in his mid 40s and a total failure. He even lost his name: during a failed attempt at a Hollywood career he changed it to become Tommy Wilhelm. By that time he had already become a failed son: a college drop-out, the first in a family of academic distinction. On the day of the action, Tommy lives in the same hotel in Manhattan as his nearly 80 y old father, a retired medical doctor and widower. TW has moved out from his wife and two kids, because of a younger woman, and he has also lost his job as a sales executive. He hardly knows how to pay for family support. His girl friend insists that he gets a divorce before continuing their relationship. He has given his last few hundred dollars to a con man for market speculation. His well-to-do father refuses to help him out with money.<br />As the song says: if it wasn't for bad luck, he wouldn't have no luck at all.<br /><br />The narration is appealing in the sense that the dreariness has an aspect of hilarious humor. We follow TW from his hotel room down to the lobby, where he buys a newspaper and chats with the kiosk operator, to the breakfast room, where he meets with his father and another hotel guest. Then he meets his `business partner', the man who dragged him into `investing in lard'. The man claims to be a psychotherapist, and he talks freely about the most colorful case histories. It seems quite obvious that he is an impostor, but his stories are tasty. He is the one who advises TW to' seize the day!' With hindsight, that can only be seen as blackest humor.<br /><br />We learn all about TW's life and habits from his own thoughts and recollections as well as from the dialogues and from the other people's silent observations on him.<br />Bellow is the all-knowing third person narrator, who assembles inner monologues from different people. We learn through their eyes that Tommy is untidy, even dirty. He is notoriously unable to follow his better instincts. He will decide not to do something and then he does it anyway. He needs uppers to get through his days. A mess of a man. He is to blame for everything bad that happened to him, because of his inability to be responsible.<br />It ends in a total dead-end: his investment is wiped out. He has nothing left. He needs to sell his junk heap of a car to pay his hotel bill. His day ends at a funeral of a stranger, where he sheds bitter tears for himself.<br /><br />Tommy was played by Robin Williams in a 2003 film, which I have not watched, and I don't quite know why I would want to. There is nothing appealing about the man. The novella needed to be as short as it is, because otherwise nobody could stay with it long enough. Is it a masterpiece as most reviewers seem to say? I am not sure. After finishing it, I wonder if the humor that is in the dialogues and the observations about the man is not of a toxic kind.his own thoughts and recollections as well as from the dialogues and from the other people's silent observations on him.

B004SBQAN8|4.0|There are two alien races on this planet. One is trying to kill the other one. The good guys look like blond surfers and the bad guys look like Darth Maul. Three of the good guys are dead. The fourth one (4 of 9) has relocated to Paradise, Ohio and is attempting to keep a low profile, but insists on going to school. Here he meets a pretty blond who is also a photographer. There are the jocks who insist he stay away from her and the class science/UFO geek who is picked on by the Jocks.<br /><br />Our hero, whose name is John Smith is going through alien puberty where he develops more superhuman powers. Through it all he must cope with the \\"agony\\" of high school, dating pretty girls, and in his spare time, defeat an alien race out to destroy him. Definitely a teen movie. It has the potential to have a sequel as well as being a TV series. No sex or nudity.
1936719010|5.0|I have read Steve Pressfield's classic \\"The War of Art\\" dozens of times, and keep the audio recording in my car for long trips.  \\"Do the Work\\" is a worthy sequel and invaluable complement.  It is both a practical guide to action (e.g. the incredible insights that research can be Resistance in drag, and that you need to keep separate the doing of the work and the reviewing of the work product) and an inspirational shot of hope and courage.  If you get nothing else from this gigantic little book than to tattoo on the inside of your forehead the understanding that \\"Resistance is the shadow cast by the innovative self's sun\\" you will reap a lifetime of rewards.<br /><br />In his book \\"For Entrepreneurs Only\\" the late Wilson Harrell wrote that when you start your own business, you will never again experience fear - because you will have graduated to terror!  The same can be said of the author, artist, and composer.  When you commit yourself to the work, terror and panic are inevitable.  Steve puts this into the right perspective - fear is good, panic is good, crashes are good.<br /><br />Several thousand years ago, Ecclesiastes offered a beautiful formula for a successful life: Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might.  In \\"Do the Work,\\" Steve Pressfield tells us how to apply all our might to that which our hand finds to do.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning I will be headed for the airport with a briefcase packed full of good intentions, as I always do.  This time, I'll have Steve's book sitting on top as a reminder the difference between wishful thinking and positive thinking is \\"doing the work.\\"
B004A8ZX28|3.0|Along with his wife, Liam Neeson is in Berlin for a biotech conference. He forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this when they arrive at the hotel. He takes a cab ride back to the airport to retrieve the briefcase and has an accident along the way. Four days later he awakens from his coma, after being dead for 7 minutes. He has no ID. He goes to the hotel where he sees his wife, except she is with a man with the same name as his (Martin Harris) and he claims that he is her husband and his wife likewise makes the same claim! At this point I was divided as to what is going on. Is this a Twilight Zone where a guy goes to an alternate reality? Maybe a \\"Dark City\\" experiment. Is this an elaborate hoax? If so why is his wife a part of it? Maybe they decided to remake Hauser's Memory (am I showing my age?) Or none of the above? Liam contacts the underground in Berlin to help him find out what is going on.<br /><br />The acting was good, as expected. The chase and action scenes were about a C+. It could have used some good swagger music, which seems to be the norm in modern movies.<br /><br />No sex or nudity. Thank you Frank Langella for keeping your pants on.

B004FN7ZOC|4.0|Amon Amarth has been one of the most consistent bands of the last decade, releasing quality album after quality album, staying true to their fans, and staying true to their style.  This album continues that successful trend; that much, is for sure.  This is definitely still Amon Amarth.  I do have problems with this album though.  From a song writing standpoint, it is a good album, but structurally the songs are safer and more formula than previous efforts.  This album is probably their lightest album in their storied collection and I can't help but get a feeling that Amon Amarth is trying to appeal to more mainstream metal fans and increase their sales and fan-base.  The trademark tremolo rhythm section that Amon Amarth has become known for is significantly diminished on this album, making the overall sound lighter and more melodic and friendly to mainstream metal fans.  The riffs themselves are not as dark and a little easier to digest than previous works, not that Amon Amarth was ever really an extremely heavy band.  Really, this album is a thrash album with death growl vocals.  Which is fine, but being a death metal fan and a fan of this band, I am not as happy with this direction.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good listen, but not nearly as good as their past 3 albums that preceded it.  I would recommend this to any of the lighter metal fans that need a \\"gateway\\" album to expand their minds into heavier metal and I would recommend this to Amon Amarth faithfuls as it is still a good album.  Fans of harder death metal such as Deicide or Morbid Angel (or even harder such as Origin or Nile), may think this album is pretty weak.  I personally think it is a little weak for this band and hope that their next release goes in a more sinister direction than this formula work.

B003T46QA2|2.0|I vowed not to read this book until a definite release date for the fifth installment was announced, because I heard all about how it's only half a story and ends with too many cliffhangers, and I wasn't interested in being kept in suspense for an indefinite period of time like so many other unfortunate Martin fans.  So as soon as I saw the announcement on his website and felt reasonably sure that it was for real after reading all the interviews he's been doing lately and seeing the other announcements, I dove right in.<br /><br />If the book had been a swimming pool, I would've broken my neck.  Johnny Carson once described the Oscars as \\"Two hours of sparkling entertainment, spread out over a four hour show.\\"  I would paraphrase the master by describing this book as half a dozen compelling pieces of information (maybe 40 pages worth) spread out over 1,000+ pages.  Martin seems to have sworn an oath himself, to never let any character give away any tiny piece of major plot development no matter what.  Oh look, Maester Aemon knows something about a prophesy concerning Daenerys and her dragons!  Will he get the chance to reveal it?  Nope, because he's about 100 years old and Daenerys isn't even in this book.  Hey check it out, someone's finally going to tell Gendry that he's the rightful King's bastard . . . at least, until a band of outlaws rides up just as she opens her mouth.  I actually punched the book at that point, and started cursing Martin.  What the hell was the point of reading this book, if I'm not going to learn anything except that Cersei's a total bitch (Thanks, that was big news!), that Littlefinger is devious (Also a giant revelation, thanks George!) and that Brienne once had a nasty joke played on her by a bunch of mean old knights?<br /><br />I admit that the descriptions of Dorne were good -- I was really interested in reading more about the Sand Snakes, but they got locked up after one chapter and no more is ever heard from them directly, so bugger that.  At one point we spend an entire chapter with a character we just met (She has two other chapters in this book, one from her POV and one from a lover but never appeared in a prior volume.) who is locked in a tower for weeks or months, which is almost as boring to read as it was for her to experience in the novel.  Finally at the end of the chapter, she has a conversation with another minor character who tells her that yet ANOTHER character that we've NEVER met is on his way to meet a main character (IF he makes it) to do SOMETHING that MIGHT have a HUGE impact on the plot **IF** it works out.  Will it?  Stay tuned!  Not in this book, of course!  Knowing Martin, he'll probably have them all murdered at a wedding before they even get where they're going so what's the point?<br /><br />This entire tome is like 1,000+ pages of foreplay with no climax, so it's unsurprising that it left thousands of readers with a serious case of the blues.  I am eager to read the fifth book and I am positive that it will be more fulfilling than this one, even if he makes us wait TEN years for \\"The Wolves of Winter.\\"  After all, good things are supposed to come to those who wait, so the longer we wait, the better it had better be.int we spend an entire chapter with a character we just met (She has two other chapters in this book, one from her POV and one from a lover but never appeared in a prior volume.) who is locked in a tower for weeks or months, which is almost as boring to read as it was for her to experience in the novel.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|THE SOCIAL NETWORK is nonlinear but still always makes sense, which is trickier than it looks. I'm not sure if it's really \\"the best movie of the year\\" -- it's actually a small story, for all of the billions Zuckerberg was eventually worth, since it's just about how one guy had an idea and pursued it even when that meant screwing over all of his friends and acquaintances -- but it's certainly a good movie, which is definitely something.<br /><br />I should back up slightly, for coherency's sake: THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of Mark Zuckerberg, who founded the social networking Internet site Facebook.com, and is currently worth north of a dozen billion dollars. In the time-honored way of tech pioneers, Zuckerberg founded Facebook while he was still an undergraduate (at Harvard -- the other time-honored part of the equation is that the pioneer must be a privileged over-achiever to begin with) about seven years ago, and the movie runs through roughly the first year of Facebook, from the night Zuckerberg threw up a \\"rate the girls of Harvard\\" site called Facemash.com to get back at the girlfriend who just dumped him to the point where he'd driven out, locked out, outmaneuvered, or alienated all of the people who had helped get Facebook started.<br /><br />Of course, that's this movie's angle; presumably Zuckerberg himself would have a different story. SOCIAL NETWORK is based very heavily on the depositions from two suits brought against Zuckerberg: one from his former best friend and the original \\"outside man\\" for Facebook, and one from a pair of vastly more overprivileged twin rowers, who seem like a gift from heaven to make Zuckerberg seem more likable in comparison with their endless smug rich-prep pose of superiority. SOCIAL NETWORK keeps looping back to those two deposition sessions, presumably because the events of them are legally guaranteed, but that keeps framing this as a story about money, when it should be a movie about connection. It is, more or less, but it could have been more visually inventive -- it's an old-fashioned, plodding sort of movie to look at, for all its zippy modern subject matter -- and could have either focused more tightly on what Facebook was -- why it was so successful, so quickly -- or on Zuckerberg himself. As it is, SOCIAL NETWORK has a bundle of good performances circling the enigma of Mark Zuckerberg, and it raises a whole lot of questions and thoughts that it isn't sure how to address.been more visually inventive -- it's an old-fashioned, plodding sort of movie to look at, for all its zippy modern subject matter -- and could have either focused more tightly on what Facebook was -- why it was so successful, so quickly -- or on Zuckerberg himself.

B0026RCAGC|5.0|Having for years been perfectly satisfied with the famous Klemperer EMI studio recording and not feeling especially tempted to try the mono Testament set (also with Klemperer at the helm) recently released, I was particularly pleased to discover how satisfying this performance is. It's not perfect; Sciutti is a little tremulous in her aria and the great Birgit sometimes sounds a bit detached -and occasionally a little under the note in the middle section of her voice - but she really delivers in her big moments and Sciutti perks up both to blend and to contrast nicely with Nilsson in the ensembles. Nilsson also scales her voice down attractively when the emotion demands it; it's not all sand-blasting by any means. Bohme's rotund bass is almost as good as Frick's and he also has a lovely speaking voice - I can never understand it when actors are used for the dialogue; their voices almost never match the singers'. That's not the case here, as the singers speak their own dialogue and very well too. McCracken is really very affecting as Florestan; he has all the notes and sounds utterly distraught - close to madness as the result of his dreadful plight, heroic and unhinged. Krause is a little jolly-sounding as Pizarro but vocalises very attractively; minor parts are well taken by some fairly major voices. Maazel's direction isn't very subtle but it's certainly dramatic and both the orchestra and the chorus are terrific. I think that opera buffs like me who have been listening for years to - and sometimes through - ropey old mono recordings full of hiss and distortion need to remember that for many newer collectors the quality of sound is very important when one is getting to know a central work like \\"Fidelio\\", and certainly this 1964 set will not disappoint in its clarity, space and dynamics; it has been beautifully re-mastered. The artificial echo effect devised for the dungeon scene was controversial but I think it works and it is certainly consistent with the overall emphasis upon a dramatic, pacy, theatrical atmosphere. And when all is said and done, the two principals are really involved and involving. I don't say that this set is preferable to the EMI with the incomparable Ludwig and Vickers but it's a credible option.emphasis upon a dramatic, pacy, theatrical atmosphere.

B00000IL26|4.0|Like the great Sam Cooke, trumpet maestro Lee Morgan had the rare and unenviable distinction of being shot dead by a woman - in Morgan's case by his common-law wife Helen More, as he was preparing to start his set at Slugs Jazz Club in NYC in February 1972. So ended the short life of one of Jazz's most creative talents at the tragically young age of 33.<br /><br />The Sidewinder is of course a species of rattlesnake. This December 1963 recording is generally regarded as Morgan's most accessible work, and something of a minor (some might say major) jazz classic essential to any serious collection. With Joe Henderson - who worked as Morgan's sideman for many years - on sax and the capable Barry Harris on piano, backed by Bob Cranshaw on bass and Billy Higgins on drums, the quintet belts out some fine up-tempo numbers most of which have a 4/4 beat, so often appeal to people who don't normally like or listen to jazz but prefer more rhythmic danceable sounds. The interplay between Morgan and Henderson in particular is really first-rate and way beyond anything found in boogaloo or R&B music of the period: this makes `The Sidewinder' a kind of crossover jazz album with wide appeal.<br /><br />Five long-ish tracks (two of more than 10 minutes' each) are complemented on the modern remix by an alternative take of `Totem Pole', the album's second great composition after the title track. All the music was composed by the talented and prolific 25-year old Morgan, and the title track achieved great popular success when released as a single.<br /><br />Unlike Miles' minimalist, super-cool and clean sound or Trane's adventurous cerebral stream-of-consciousness playing, Morgan's trademark sound is upbeat, happy and enjoyable, and this is definitely a repeat-play album which gets better each time you hear it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I began using Jillian's 30 Day Shred as soon as I was cleared by my OB to workout post-baby (6 weeks). I measured my waist, hips, and thigh prior to starting and am happy to report that after doing the video for 15 days, I've lost 2 inches from my waist, thighs, and hips! This video, along with an occasional afternoon walk or yoga/pilates, and a healthy diet, helped me get back to my pre-pregnancy weight by the time I was 9 weeks post-partum.     What I like about this video is that there are 3 workouts of increasing difficulty so that your body is constantly being challenged. Also, these workouts can be done in less than 30 minutes (a major plus when you are taking care of a baby) and you definitely feel like you have had a total body workout. Also, modified versions of of the exercises are provided (just follow Anita). I spent 10 days on each workout before moving on. I used 3 lb weights for the first 5 days of each new level and followed Anita who did the modified versions of the exercises. By the time I hit day 6 of each new workout I upgraded to 5 lb weights and tried to follow Natalie as much as possible.      This workout is tough (intermediate level exerciser) but well worth the effort!
B00005JPMZ|5.0|When I heard about this movie coming out, I groaned. Yeah, fabulous...another cutesy butchering of what was originally a somewhat dark comic series (dark compared to what it is now, anyway). And I know that TMNT is aimed at the younger masses today, so I understand some kiddie-fying to make it sell. Anyway, I was impressed by it. First and foremost, the animation had my attention. I kind of liked the tall, slender look the Turtles were given...as opposed to looking very wide in past incarnations. And all the characters seemed to stick relatively true to their actual personalities: Leonardo being the teacher's pet, Donatello being the geek, Raphael being an angry jerk, and Michealangelo being an idiot with a surfer's voice. Why they turned April into a cutesy teenybopper-looking girl is beyond me, though.<br /><br />The plot was cool - I like how they used a comic book ally (Karai) besides having the Shredder come back to life *again*. And I like how the Turtles kind of went and did their own thing when Leonardo left to go find himself in South America. Sure, they remained in the same home, but rather than fighting crime, they all went and got jobs. Well, save for Raphael. Then again, this struck me as a little odd since in past movies, the Turtles were encouraged by Splinter to not let themselves be seen publicly. Sooo, now that's okay? That threw me off a little.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it too much for folks who have not seen it, so I'll just say that it is a really good animated film and if you like the Ninja Turtles, it's a pretty nifty film.
B003L20ICE|5.0|If there was a category of films that share a common trait of focusing on ordinary and not so ordinary family situations, The Kids Are All Right would be put in that category along with other films that possess the trait of dysfunctional familial relations and unexpected occurrences, such as Little Miss Sunshine and Smart People.  But the film's cast of notable and critically acclaimed actors, Annette Bening (Nic), Julianne Moore (Jules), Mark Ruffalo (Paul), and the dynamic chemistry that each display as well as the film's screenplay convincingly and successfully show the irony, humor, and emotion of each of the characters.  Despite the well-known names of the film, it is the enticing subject matter that may draw the viewer.<br /><br />The premise of the film involves a unique family with Bening and Moore playing the parents to two teenagers Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson).  The family appears to experience the average ups and downs of raising two teenagers on the brink of adulthood.  But things begin to go astray when Joni happens to come across old paperwork pertaining to a sperm donor; after finding the information, decides to seek sperm donor, Paul.  And while Joni and Laser attempt to acquaint themselves with Paul, Nic and Jules had already been experiencing a bit of distance and lack of intimacy, and as Paul enters the picture, things become complicated between the two as well as the entire family; what appeared to be productive familial relationship blossoming with a new member of the family, the event only causes friction.<br /><br />The Kids Are All Right was deserving of Academy Award nominations because of all aspects of the film from the characters to the complex storyline.  The film has a variety of moments that viewers will find thought provoking and surprising, especially with the issues that are depicted within particular scenes that involve sexuality, indiscretions, and perceptions.  Indeed, a film highly recommended.

B000002UCN|4.0|Yes, it was insulting that the record company felt it had to pad out a George `Best of' with Beatles numbers by George. Still, that move does serve to remind us that George WAS a Beatle and remained quite capable of writing and performing Beatlesworthy material, at least sporadically, long past the split. And so it was for the other three as well.
B004FOA84A|5.0|just right challenging for 7 and 9 year old, we had several hours of family fun, including looking up a few hints ;) looking forward to a sequel, thx
B004XS97KO|5.0|I have been watching Dr. Who since about 1980. The new season is great. It is nice to be able to get the shows from Amazon and not have to wait for it to come to PBS 2 years later or have to buy cable TV. This season teams up the Doctor with Richard Nixon. I can not wait to see more shows!
B004XS97KO|5.0|I am so glad that the Doctor is back and it looks like we have a rip-roaring season of awesome ahead of us! I absolutely adore Matt Smith as the Doctor, he is definitely My Doctor, and Stephen Moffet makes my brain explode in awe with his fantastic writing!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This a good, fairly strong international thriller that takes place in France and Italy.  Depp and Jolie do a great job as the two leads. She is an agent and he, apparently, is an American tourist who gets caught up in a hunt for someone who owes a great deal of money.  Romance ensues.  I do not want to reveal the rest but there are some unexpected twists that occur towards the end.  Very entertaining.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Maybe the hype produced expectations that were too high, but I found the movied just good. As I watched, I was comparing it to A Man for All Seasons, which is by far a better movie. I give this movie 4 stars, but that is more a commentary on how bad movies are now in general. But I recommend this movie as it is worth seeing. The friendship developed is the best part.
B000007MVD|5.0|OK, it's of great interest to hear the Beatles as less a rock band and more the fluffy pop band they might have become absent a public that found greater appeal in their harder edge. Of the covers we hear on this set for the first time, though, a dozen would surely have been more appropriate for their early albums than some of their actual choices: A Shot of Rhythm and Blues, Sweet Little Sixteen, That's All Right (mama), Nothin' Shakin', Too Much Monkey Business, Ooh! My Soul, I Got to Find My Baby, Glad All Over, I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry (Over You), Johnnie B. Goode, Young Blood and Some Other Guy. And then there's the Beatles original I'll Be On My Way'. Granted it's a bit `moon in June'-ish , but it has a gorgeous melody, is well-performed and depicts a situation not uncommon albeit deploying a few corny phrases. And that's about as much of the Beatles at the Beeb that I want to hear more than once, apart from `live' versions of studio-recorded Beatles originals.  It's amazing how keen fans are on this mostly early-Beatles fare, much of it covers. The other end of their career--post 1969--offers a phantasmagoria of Beatle treats, but it has yet to catch on as a bona fide Beatles era with its own motherlode of treasure.
B004GYY714|1.0|not regular speaker. what the h? i do not get this at all and there seems to be no way to contact company about it
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full<br />of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good<br />(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm<br />ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,<br /><br />Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really<br />getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction<br />is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those<br />themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with<br />the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of<br />depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.<br />By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the<br />top, and a bit illogical.<br /><br />Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's<br />bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a<br />2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in<br />admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain (ARR) is narrated by Enzo, a wise dog with, on the circle of reincarnation, a soul that is almost human.  By the way, that is Enzo's opinion of himself, based on a documentary on Mongolia that he watched - it said that when a dog finished living his lifetimes as a dog, his next incarnation will be as a man.  ARR begins with Enzo at the end of his life confident that he will be a human soon - we know right away what Enzo's fate is.  But what is it about Enzo that makes him so certain about his rebirth?    The plot, which largely revolves around events in his owner's (Denny) life, is not nuanced and, at times, can feel slightly contrived.  But the book succeeds because the plot is merely a vehicle; along side the plot are Enzo's delightfully perceptive, compassionate and funny insights and thoughts about life and the human condition. By the end of the book, I was convinced Enzo would be reincarnated as human too. Why? Because Enzo embodies the person that I want to be - loyal, compassionate, wise, forgiving, loving.  Enzo warmed my heart, made me laugh and cry and renewed my faith in karma and the Golden Rule.  ARR is a delightful novel - highly recommended!    (I'm no expert on reincarnation, so I am in no way implying that humans are \\"higher\\" or \\"lower\\" than dogs, what the mechanics of reincarnation are, etc...  If you know, please feel free to comment and let me know.)

B00466HN6S|3.0|I had to pick something to see at the theatre when the family decided to go. There weren't many choices so I ended up seeing this one. The children in the theatre  liked it. So If you're looking to take the kids  that area is pretty much covered. If you're looking for something you might like as well there will be a problem. The film itself is mediocre and extremely predictable.<br /><br />Eb, the future \\"Easter Bunny\\" enjoys a great life on Easter island (The actual location) he is very close to his father , the current Easter Bunny who  oversees the factory for easter baskets and their contents.The latter is run by chicks.  From a very young age shows he quite talented at drumming. It isn't long before he decides he wants it to be his career. His father  deems this dream ridiculous and thus EB leaves Easter Island and eventually meets Fred O Hare, a man who hasn't worked in over a year and keeps botching every job interview he gets.<br /><br />You can guess what happens from there and I'm certain you'll get it right.<br /><br />There is nothing unique or remotely appealing in this film It's just one of the things  that can only be described as \\"Cute\\"<br />Some parts I feel  ccan be described as cheesy simply because of the cast. It seems they just threw together a medley of has-beens and rising groups. David Hasslehoff makes an appearance as well the Blind Boys of Alabama.<br /><br />I was also a little irked by the stereotypical implications of the voices. The chicks speak with a hispanic accent and are the primary workers in the factory. When EB is around the Blind Boys (An african American group of blind men)  he speaks  (Or tries to.) In a stereotypical dialect.The film could have done without that.<br /><br />So if you like the predictable or just need something to take the kids to this'll be ok. emphasis on \\"OK\\"
0316010669|1.0|Blink's main idea is that with limited information people are able to make good decisions.  That being said I found it both ironic and irritating that the author was so long winded in convincing the reader of this insight.  In fact this insight isn't original psychologists have known for awhile that intuition is nothing more than really fast thinking.  The more expertise one has in an area the quicker they are to make a good decision.  Consider the x-ray technician takes one look at an x-ray and knows exactly what is broken and how bad.  The patient has been staring at the x-ray and doesn't understand what to look for. The x-ray technican has looked at thousands and knows exactly what to look for.  This book isn't worth the time it takes to read it. An article is about all it takes to present the information contained.  It promises to be groundbreaking but instead the book should be buried.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Too short, was done with it in less than an hour.  Should be free because its not worth any amount of money. If it were free it would be about 3 stars since theres not much to lose.
0805066691|3.0|It has been 41 years since this best seller was published.  The book is more a historical romance than history.  Mr. Brown was not a trained historian, and does not claim to be.  The book lacks an introduction and preface as one expects in scholarly works.  While it is always a question whether even a professional historian can be objective, anyone who has read more contemporary historical works in this area will quickly see that Mr. Brown's approach lacks objectivity. A couple of examples: In Chapter Two of the book, \\"The Long Walk of the Navahos,\\" the author ends with the observation that the Navahos would be the least unfortunate of the western Indians. He conveniently omits that the Navahos number about 250,000, have a reservation about the size of West Virginia, have developed a self-sustaining tourism business with their arts and crafts, and have maintained their language and culture.  In Chapter Three, \\"Little Crow's War,\\" Mr. Brown fails to state that there was dissention among the Sioux about even starting a war, that cooler heads did not prevail, and that the Sioux warriors started the \\"war\\" by killing 400 to 500 unarmed settlers including men, women, and children which prompted calling in some military forces in the middle of the Civil War.  In several places Mr. Brown suggests that practice of mutilation including scalping had been introduced by Europeans; later study has shown scalping and mutilation were practiced by Indians before Columbus.  The events described by Mr. Brown are substantially accurate as far as they go, and there is no doubt that Indians west of the Mississippi suffered greatly under the tsunami of westward settlement in the 19th century.  My opinion, the book has been superceded by later scholarship.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|RCT3 is a great game with unlimited possibilities. The chance to design your own roller coasters is only limited by your imagination. Download custom scenery from various fan sites to extend the fun, or build your own with third party programs and import into the game. I gave a copy to my grandson, so I had to have one for myself.
0765348780|5.0|I loved the book.    Nice characters. I like their behaviour, way of thinking. Good dialogues.  The sheer scope of the world. Geography, magic! WOW!  Concise description where appropriate.  The language is easy going. This book grabbed my attention from the start. There was no period when I had to adjust myself to Erikson's style.  I had some reservations after reading reviews where people complained about Magic system. That mages are omnipotent, they can do whatever they like, for example, wiping out an entire Army with a couple of spells and it is not fun etc. I disagree with the reviewers. The magic is a lot more than that, it is deeper and has many layers. Even Gods are mortal. /\\"It is now we gods who are the slaves, and the mortals our masters - though they know it not\\"/    I think it is a true epic fantasy.  If the rest of the series is at least as good, it will be a fantastic journey.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a fantastic album, it marries soulful singing with hard edged beats that permeate your mind. Adeles' lyrics can fit situations of the past and present no matter your age and her voice will keep you coming back for more. A must have for your collection.

I like the cheaper option to buy the blu-ray/DVD combo pack because I don't yet have a blue-ray player but plan to in the near future and it will be nice to have some Blu-rays when I do get one.  This gives me way to transition from DVD without breaking the bank.  Overall this show is worth the purchase.

0316069353|5.0|Jeez, some reviewers take books way to seriously.  This is another great book  by Michael Connelly that is fun to read; fast paced, interesting, always just a bit over the edge of reality. So in a nutshell, it is fun to read.  I have read everything he has published and haven't been disappointed once.  So, Michael, step up the pace and write more.
0312600844|2.0|I loved The Corrections and had anticipated greatness in Franzen's new book, Freedom. Raving reviews added to my intrigue. Unfortunately, this book turns out to be self absorbed and the characters never felt real. None of them. Unnecessary sexual and scatalogical details added nothing except what many authors seem to feel is a misguided degree of sophistication. Franzen was wrong on this--it just felt dirty without adding any value, which is in distinct contrast to the author's earlier works. At several turns, the book gave hints that it would deliver the incredible characters and complexity of The Corrections, but as the final pages arrived, it seemed simply that the author--like myself--simply grew so tired of this project that he just had to finish it an move on to something more substantive.
B004PGO25O|3.0|Maybe it's not fair to ask you, \\"What do you expect from a free ebook?\\" Well I did expect something more because it was endoresed by Seth Godin. So much of what we're lacking in the world has to do with quality and creativity. The best things take time to get done. Rome was not built over a weekend.

1934356476|5.0|I've been using Ruby for about 3 years now and thought I had a good understanding of the language and its capabilities. Wow, was I wrong! This book was like a grenade going off in my head that rearranged my perception of Ruby programming reality. There is a ton of good information in this book that can be used for new projects, refactoring, and anything in between.     A great thing about this book is that it presents these cool but seemingly impractical techniques, and then gives you a great real world example of just how common and practical it really is. Another thing I wasn't expecting is the humor. I laughed out loud reading some sections of the book.    I'm not sure that I'd recommend this for the new Rubyist, but if you have a decent foundation, this book will take you to the next level.

0061128562|5.0|This is an absolutely charming, clever and delightful children's \\"story\\", and this is the only one of his books that has a CD.  It is extremely clever and helps children learn to repeat what they hear, listen carefully, AND start learing to read by listening to the words on the CD.  I would recommend it to anyone with young children starting with age 2-3 at least.
B00006LPER|2.0|Superbly acted by Huppert, but couldn't get past the painful granularity of a character that leaves the viewer no choice but to despise her. Her passive-aggressive sadism towards others is born out of the hatred she has for herself. Among the physical abuse she commits against herself in various ways, she also commits the worst kind of betrayal - a teacher who hates her own pupils to the point of committing acts of violence against them - no one is safe around her - she hates all equally. She pours broken glass into a student's coat pocket out of some senseless deranged jealousy, thus completely destroying that student's hope for a career as a pianist. As equally as she doles out the psychological and physical abuse (there is a revolting scene of some sort of bizarre sexual attack she commits against her own mother, whom she sleeps with in the same bed), she also demands to be abused. She asks her student-boyfriend to beat her (and he obliges, seemingly with some regret) but that can't compare with how much she hates herself.<br /><br />Instead of caring about this character, I found myself disgusted by her (mostly because of her own weakness and unwillingness to change). This woman puts on an air of strength, stoicism, and intelligence, but it is really just a cover for her weakness as a person devoid of any conscious. She is too weak to break the sick relationship she has with her dominating mother, so her life is a gradual escalation of a psychosis that she allows to destroy her. She is a dangerous, sociopathic individual with no hope, so the entire film becomes a disturbing examination of that.

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Okay, here is the deal.  That digital Jeff Bridges was a masterpiece. My own family believes CLU was a real person.  Can you say clueless? The movie is short and and the CGI is overblown. The best part of this movie is believing you can digitalize yourself.
1416550534|3.0|What a great author is Kate Morton.  With the House at Riverton, I have completed her first three novels.  This was not my favorite but I can't deny Ms. Morton's writing ability. This novel is very sad and really never redeems itself of grief.  Kate reveals a great truth following the war: the difficulty of returning to life in a pre-war era and the disintegration of morals, along with the loyalty of family and its servants.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I'm not going to mince words.  \\"Citizen Kane\\".  \\"Raging Bull\\".  \\"The Godfather\\".  \\"The King's Speech\\".  It's that good.  I feel honored and privileged to be able to comment on a piece of art that is so majestic.  In my lifetime I can remember few occasions where I was left so entranced and mesmerized after viewing a film.  The other times were the aforementioned \\"Raging Bull\\" and the others were \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  I could write paragraph after paragraph about how this film excels on every level so I'll try to nutshell as best as possible.  For starters, Colin Firth is an absolute marvel as the future monarch of Britain.  Some actors would overplay the speech impediment but Firth makes it seem so natural as if he lived with it his whole life.  The stammer is only one aspect of Firth's character.  He's required to exorcise personal demons while tackling a constitutional crisis as well as a forboding war with Germany.  Geoffery Rush may have gotten a supporting actor nod but I found it more of a co-starring performance.  The film resonates with the alchemy between Firth and the benign toughlove approach of Rush's speech therapist.  If you don't believe the role reversal between the king and servant then the film doesn't work but here it's eminently credible.  The ensemble here is impeccable so I don't want to single anyone out.  Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, Anthony Andrews, Derek Jacobi and even then I believe there's some omissions.  Tom Hooper has ridden to the top of the class as a filmmaker to watch out for.  Stylistically the film reminded me a lot of David Lean .  You are led to believe that you are watching a large scale epic despite the relatively meager budget Hooper had to work with.  Also impressive is David Seidler's screenplay.  The septugenarian Seidler intricately melds the more intimate aspects of the story with the larger scale historical details.  His script is so rich with information that you are left enthralled throughout.  \\"The King's Speech\\" is that once in a generation film experience that will be savored for ages.  On a totally superfluous note I's like to recommend a couple obscure Colin Firth films, \\"Fever Pitch\\" and \\"Where the Truth Lies\\".  The first is a Nick Hornby adaptation and the second is an intriguing Atom Egoyan effort that Firth in interviews cited as one of his personal favorites.

I had loved each book and felt like I did not want to ruin my feelings about the characters and author. I talked with my daughter and mentioned some of the negative feelings in the reviews, and she said that the series had a definite conclusion. She said that she thought that I would appreciate the final book. She was right! You owe it to yourself to read the ending written by the author who created the series. Don't Miss This Final Book!

B003JTHESA|1.0|\\"But I want to listen to Iron Maiden LOUD\\", you cry. Of course you do, and so do I. But that means YOU turning up the volume on your sound system till it's loud enough for your taste, instead of listening to a recording which was so poorly mastered that its sound waves have simply been \\"clipped\\" (cut off) and its audio distorted because the volume was set so high that it exceeded the CD-Audio specifications. That's what the \\"loudness war\\" is all about - in an effort to make buyers think they are getting a better product because it sounds louder, they are actually offering you a badly mixed, distorted recording with parts of the audio just NOT present on the CD. This was the case with most Iron Maiden's \\"enhanced\\" re-releases, but in those cases you could still get the original CD releases. Since this is a new album, there is no alternative, my friend - you are going to have to listen to a distorted recording with poor dynamic range and parts of the audio missing. This CD has 2969 clipped samples on the left channel and 2116 clipped samples on the right channel - that is, at those points, the sound wave volume level was pushed above the CD-Audio specification limits and was cut off - like a hill that had its top flattened out. Since Iron Maiden has long had full control over their productions, it's hard not to blame the band for this shameful release, technically speaking. As a long time, die-hard fan, I feel disrespected and betrayed by them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best App ever!  Not only is it a Bible reader, but it helps with Bible reading plans, the audio Bible is excellent and the Live feature and other extras are just fantastic bonuses!

B004UOCF3W|5.0|It's been quite some time since I posted a review here, but this album is so good that it has to be commented on.      Foo Fighters continue to separate themselves from the pack and prove once again that they are one of the best bands on the planet -- hands down.  Dave Grohl is nothing short of a musical genius, and he has really put his talents on display on Wasting Light.  There isn't an average tune to be found -- they are all outstanding.  Everything these guys put out is quality, but Wasting Light may just be their finest overall work ever -- and that's saying something.    Since there are plenty of exhaustive reviews here already, I'll keep it short and say that whether you are a Foo Fighters fan or not, if you're looking for a perfect rock album from start to finish, go pick this up RIGHT NOW!  You'll be listening to this for years to come.

0061353248|5.0|Whether it is deciding on what toppings to put on our pizza, or setting a corporate strategy, decision making is an important, but sometimes poorly understood topic.  This book is definitely one of the best on decision making, precisely because it focuses on this topic and economics, psychology and behavior that are crucially connected to it.      Being an academic, Dan Ariely takes the academic's approach to research based on professional studies, but presents them in a very easy to understand way.  He thus translates the invaluable hard data of academia into a language we can all understand.      Furthermore, these lessons are not distant concepts, but are applied by Ariely to our everyday lives.      By being so immensely practical, the book expands beyond the science presented in it and into the spiritual and philosophical.  However, it is all grounded in an academic's approach backed by scientific data.  So after reading this book, you will know that your decision to read it and follow through with its recommendations is not just based on reason, but on hard facts.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Dont think twice about it! It's worth every penny!<br /><br />I needed a macro lens to get extreme close-ups of toys for my animation projects. Unfortunately, macro lenses cost a fortune.  I came upon the Raynox as an alternative and now I wonder why everybody doesn't own one of these.  This lens even kickstarted a new hobby of mine... insect photography.  This lens has brought nothing but joy and excitement to my life.
B004P9FAK2|5.0|People are giving this and the Order of the Phoenix sets 1-star reviews for not being extended editions, despite the fact that 1) they aren't CLAIMING to be extended editions, and 2) there's no evidence that extended editions of these films will ever exist at all. Yes, the first and second one had extended editions. That doesn't mean all of them will, and for goodness sake, nobody OWES you a damned extended edition.     If you don't want to buy it or intend to hold off on it on the hopes that your imagined extended edition will someday come to pass, go ahead. But don't give a product you don't own a poor review, just because you don't like that it isn't something it doesn't claim to be.
0439023513|3.0|It's been eight or nine months since Book #1's 74th Hunger Games, a matter of days since Catching Fire, Book #2's 75th Hunger Games, and already the stress and mental anguish are seriously affecting Katniss Everdeen.  In District 13, as she recovers from the physical injuries she sustained in the latest Games, it's obvious there's not much more she can take.<br /><br />Collins never set out to portray Katniss as some infallible super hero.  After all, despite her incredible strength of character in Book #1, she's still only a 17 year old girl -- with limitations just like the rest of us.  Unfortunately, she's about reached the extent of those limitations.  With the exception of two very exciting scenes in Mockingjay, Katniss spends most of the book as a passive viewer of plot events, rather than an active participant.<br /><br />As a result, I found the storytelling in book 3 to be difficult to follow.  It's hard to tell when Katniss is speculating on events, when events are really happening, or what is taking place in the world of Panem outside of what she is aware of.  Furthermore, she relays the story with a kind of passivity that suggests she's too numb to care.<br /><br />Though it doesn't have the warm, fuzzy ending that most readers would hope for, Mockingjay is a believable conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy.
1400049628|4.0|I really enjoyed how this survival manual educated me about the potential hazards that the Zombie population can bring to a community.  I had no idea how complex of a creature they are.  Not only did it educate me on how to properly take out a Zombie (amoung other life threating beings) or even a swam of the undead by the most important way of either decapitaion or with a proper head shot with a rifle.  What I enjoyed learning most was about all the different weapons that are out there whether past down from history to currently being used.  I also found the two different way to arm myself highly educating, which are primary weaspons and secondary weapons to be crucial.  It is essential to be able to travel with safety by carrying the proper weapons that will protect you yet not hinder your ability to escape quickly.  Due to this manual I will now be prepared when it's time to scout for my fortress of saftty with my group (which I am already working closely with those particular individuals, you know who you are).   I also now know how serious it is to dispose of the living dead/biohazardous material properly, which is by fire.  Fire is such an important weapon but, if not used properly it can become one of your biggest enemies.  Safety, safety, safety can never been forgotten or taken for granted.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is intrested in protecting oneself and the people they care about most.

B0034G4P7Q|2.0|I've seen all the oscar nominations and this is by far the weakest entry.<br /><br />Major kudos to the directing style and cinematography, but that is about it.<br /><br />Acting is standard, if not cheesy and overdone.  Characters are WAY too overblown to be believable, story is lame and the ending doesn't have any quality or quantity.<br /><br />No real character development or interesting moments.  It just feels like superbad.<br /><br />And that is exactly what it is...Super Bad.<br /><br />Credits for artistic value, but it's attempt to \\"connect\\" to an audience (that I'm still unsure of) fails miserably.  A teen Docu-Drama that should have stuck to the facts.<br /><br />Not a \\"landmark\\" film in any way.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This was not the best murder/mystery I have read nor was it the worst.  Parts of this story drug on, esp. when it went into too much detail on the family background.  I found myself wanting to skip ahead.  I foumd myself losing interest, I did finish the book and liked the twist at the end.  I will NOT purchase the next 2 books in the series.  Bevery Barton's books are better!!!

B00005B364|5.0|My cousin, a budding electronic musician, handed this album (along with Hamburger Concerto) down to me in 1975 and changed my musical world.  I sat spellbound, almost not in my body, while the music infused my brain.  True psychedelia, no chemicals required.      I'm intrigued by the reviews that state that Hocus Pocus is the only really interesting thing on the album.  After two or three or a hundred listens, I often dropped the needle after Hocus Pocus, as it became the least interesting track on the album to me.  Yodeling is cool, but really?  It felt like shtick.  Moving Waves, as well as the second side track with piano and flute, became my two favorites.  I learned the piano riff and chord progression from side two (I-flat major III, flat major VII, I) and played them over and over and over and over...    I took this album to college, and for four years in a practice room as I studied classical piano, I played those chords to soothe myself and played Focus in my dorm room (in heavy rotation with Led Zeppelin and Mussourgsky) to keep myself sane.  As I moved through the next three decades, and my LP collection was slowly dismantled due to time, taste, loss of my turntable and many moves, I have continued to haul around my Focus albums.  They're within a few feet of me as I type-- unplayable, but beloved.     I assumed that these albums would be long out of print and unavailable.  I look forward to being able to plug them into my car and for the first time in my life, head out on an interstate with these Dutch boys wailing in my ears.  I'll have to remember to stay in my body this time...
0312600844|1.0|Although an easy read, I don't consider this book worth the time invested in reading it.  What I wish I had invested more time in was reading the reviews, but I liked \\"Corrections\\" so much that I went ahead with the purchase.  Plot doesn't present many surprises and the ending is very predictable.  I typically avoid Oprah's Book Club selections and should have followed that practice with this one as well.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Yes, the 10th anniversary was great, and yes, Colm Wilkinson was the definitive Valjean.  However, Alfie Boe brings a sweet depth to the character and his Bring Him Home is superb. The much maligned Nick Jonas brought a poignancy to Marius that heightened the dilemna to stand with his friends. All the leads are quite good; Norm Lewis is terrific and Ramin Karimloo is a standout as Enjolras. This production stands on its own and is a welcome addition to my library.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Not a bad movie, it's good love the Boston accent thank god Ben is getting his mojo back. Didn't know what to make of this movie but I was entertain.

B00337KM2S|4.0|What I really like about this film is that it deals with contemporary topics like unemployment and making commitments. George Clooney's character, Ryan, is hired by various companies to fire employees, and feels that living  and loving without any strings attached is perfect for him. When his boss suddenly announces he wants to cut costs by having Ryan make layoff announcements through videoconferencing instead, he tries to prove why dismissing people in person is a much better option. A new employee who proposed the idea of videoconferencing accompanies him, and both of them learn a lot about this industry as well as about life itself.<br /><br />A couple of people argued that this movie is boring. It's true that \\"Up in the Air\\" doesn't contain fast-paced action or dramatic special effects, but this isn't the movie to watch if you're looking for any of those. What \\"Up in the Air\\" does provide is a relatively unpredictable, satisfying movie that most people can understand if not relate to themselves. And it might even teach you a lesson or two. Many employers in this recent recession had to fire devoted workers because of the need to cut costs, and since laying people off was such a daunting task, Ryan and others like him were hired to do it. But then, Ryan's company began to go through a similar transformation.<br /><br />One issue this film raised for me was what kind of company costs should be kept despite harder financial times, as Ryan was trying to prove that his expensive plane tickets were worth defending. I thought the overall message of the movie was a bit \\"up in the air\\" and unclear, but otherwise, it was a great film.

0307346617|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Not your typical horror-genre read - though there is plenty of suspense and gore - the premise of the book guides you through the social impact of a world-wide zombie infestation as told by the survivors.  I was a history major and wish desperately that more of the required reading about real history had been written as well as this fictional historical acocunt.  Would have made staying up late studying a lot easier.  I highly recommend this book!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|PERSUASION is a Jane Austen's less known book than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE or SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, written when the author was older. This book has a very refined and complex plot and many scholars consider that the heroin of this book, Anne Elliot, is one of the most complex characters that Ms. Austen created. I have readen all her books and I must agree with them. She is not the vivacious Elizabeth Bennett or the sensible Eleanor Darwood,or even the lovely Emma, but in Anne the aspect of introversion and reflexion are profound. It is not very easy to read her emotions, she conceals them very well, and being a very private person, her thoughts are not very easily apparent to the others. Her refusal of the proposal of marriage at 19 years old put her \\"in the shelf\\" and the reasons for this refusal are not very clear, but it seemed influenced by an older friend that thought that the impoverished pretendent was not \\"good enough\\" for the young Anne, daughter of a baronet. Since then, she lived for the confort of her family without any recognition. The return of her former pretendent to the place where she lives now makes her review her past actions and consider if the life that she is living now is better than the risk of the marriage at 19 with a man that she obviously loved. This is the plot of the romance and also of the movie. The richness and quality of the drama of Ms. Austen's book is well known but must be very difficult to portray in a movie of more or less than 2 hours. Fortunately for the fans this movie achieved this almost impossible task. With the key characters played by Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) and Ciaran Hind (Captain Wentworth) and a support cast of magnificent quality , the movie portrays the intricacies of the romance with superb maestry and the actress playing Anne (probably the most difficult character of Ms. Austen to play) makes a job so good that watching the movie we can see her inner conflicts and hopes, the despair and the happiness in her face almost without any words being said. Ciaran Hind is a magnificent Navy Captain and makes the perfect pair for Amanda Root. They are older than the other characters in the other books of Ms. Austen (Anne must be at least 27-28 years old and Captain Wentworth is certanly more than 30, almost 35 years old) but it must be mentioned that Persuasion was the last book of Ms. Austen. If you want to enjoy a extremely good romantic movie, faithful to the spirit of the book and with a superb cast, figurines and scenario, you will enjoy this adaptation very much. Is is priceless,a delicate jewel that follows  the spirit of Jane Austen's world with respect and even admiration. If you enjoyed Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson or Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow you will enjoy Persuasion very much. Highly recommended!face almost without any words being said.

B003VIWO9I|5.0|Great book!  Very much in keeping with the previous books in the series.  I almost didn't buy it because I read another review which said the footnotes (one of the more entertaining sections of any Terry Pratchett book) were not included in the Kindle edition.  They are included as asterisks - you have to go in front of the * to see the footnote.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was really fun to play - albeit it was a bit short. I beat it from start to finish in an hour and a half without any help. But it really was like playing Myst on my phone. The interface is perfect too and the controls are easy - that's why I hope they make more games like this, only longer. If they make a game that takes 10+ hours to beat it'd be worthy of 6 stars.
1439102724|3.0|Jodi Picoult's prose is always seamless and easy to read. I'm always very impressed with the depth of her characters and the way she develops the plots. In Sing You Home, however, I thought her political agenda showed through entirely too much to be able to enjoy the book to its fullest. It was very one-sided (what was the point of Max's awful decision about 2/3rds into the book except to make him look even dumber?). The characters in this book were stereotypical and one-dimensional. I don't think the way to open the eyes of narrow-minded people is to hate on Christianity. The two big messages that I got from this book were 1) Gay rights and 2) being Christian just means you believe whatever someone tells you. I think we can spread equality without adding fire to a war that's already waged. I don't think this book is going to make the people that NEED to open their eyes and hearts actually do that. It's simply going to make harder shells for both sides of this \\"fight.\\"
B000X107GI|5.0|I used these batteries to replace the batteries in my candles.  They seem fine, and they are still working.  I don't leave the candles turned on all the time, but the look nice when on.<br />The batteries arrived by mail and it was so much easier than trying to find the correct size in the stores.  I'm not sure on the life of the batteries, but they should last longer than the original ones.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|The Town is an pretty decent movie surprisingly even if it is not accurate because there is no Gingers in this one like there was in The Fighter,We know Boston has Gingers(but they are not as annoying as NewYorkers) and yet we get people who don't look Bostonian or are \\"toonies\\" instead of townies,that aside THERE IS NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES(READ CRIMINAL,I don't care if you were raised by a crack addict).Ben Whofleck(Aflac,Er afleck) did good this time as a Director and as a Actor even if he has a Pompous Like Matt Damon.The Action is great,the story is predictable but At least action packed.Even if the Police are portrayed As Incompetent(You know well You would be caught in under 5 mins and Thank God for that and For Them).This film is still worth watching despite the played-out robin hood-esque theme.
030746363X|5.0|Before this, I had never read/tried diet or exercise programs. The slow-carb diet worked for me and is now working for the people around me. The diet is simple, easy to understand and easy to follow. The weekly binge day is pretty awesome as soon as you learn what foods your \\"new\\" body will accept and reject.     I followed the diet strictly (no cheating) and have lost 36 pounds in 3.5 months - from a snug size large to a loose fitting medium. Now that I'm officially skinny (<10% body fat), I'm moving onto the muscle gaining sections of the book. Since the fat loss section worked flawlessly, I believe the muscle section will as well.    P.S. If you're not going to follow the program perfectly, don't do it. It won't work. It'll only work if you stick to proteins, legumes and vegetables exclusively. Even a little bit of carbs or dairy will kill the results.
B004FOA84A|5.0|this game is awesome. just past it. its totally kid friendly. this is not a scary hunted house or anything like that. although the music does sound spooky at times. Its all puzzle solving. it is a bit challenging. watch everything for clues. I do wish it was alot longer though.
1400032717|4.0|I read this for a college course but this book is great for many age levels. I think this book would be great for middle school children and older. It has elements of adventure and mystery. The boy telling the story sees the world in a different and extremely enlightening way. Family relationships also play an important role in the story. I would definitely recommend this book.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Some people have noted that the transfer is too perfect and small imperfections become painfully glaring on the bluray. While you can notice some flickering of the outlines on characters, they're never distracting to me. I feel the picture quality is really good on my 23\\" 1920x1080p e-IPS monitor (Dell u2311h). I haven't bothered to compare with the DVD version, so it's possible they played with the saturation/brightness but if they did, it was for the better. I only listen to it on my headphones, so I'm limited in soundstage separation, but I can still clearly note different placements of the instruments during the musical numbers. I love listening to the songs in this movie even without 7.1 speakers to take full advantage of what it offers (my software player uses dolby headphones to re-encode the 7.1 track to sound better for headphones).
0199588708|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2P458JNLNT7D0]]THE LATEST EDITION OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RULES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Duncan Atkinson and Tim Moloney have produced a much needed new edition of the Criminal Procedure Rules, which, as practitioners realize, have effectively created a new landscape in the criminal courts in England and Wales.<br /><br />Governing, as they do, all aspects of criminal procedure in all criminal courts, these rules were designed to bring about a cultural change.  They affect not just practitioners, but all those involved in the criminal justice system, even though many practitioners initially thought that they would have little impact.  In fact, they have become an essential litigation framework, with the new provisions they contain aimed at increasing efficiency and improving case management.<br /><br />Part of the estimable Blackstone's Guide Series, this new Second Edition contains the full updated Criminal Procedure Rules 2010, and the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction.  The result is a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of relevant procedural materials.<br /><br />Amendments to the rules made since they were introduced mean they are now known as a `cradle to grave pathway' that practitioners must follow. An obvious benefit of the new rules is that they codify and consolidate rules previously contained in hundreds of different documents.<br /><br />How useful then, that this indispensible Guide provides such a full, clear analysis of the Rules, placing them in context and tracking their development since their introduction in 2005. Following the structure of the Rules, they include checklists of time limits and key tasks to be performed.<br /><br />Clearly, the publishers have seen that we, as practitioners, need publications which are produced as soon as practicable after the legislative enactments, accompanied by serious and experienced expert analysis by leading lawyers on the scope, extent and effects of the statutes.  Atkinson and Moloney deliver all this and more in this volume.<br /><br />Containing a copy of the Act plus key in-depth information, it's an invaluable tool if you need to act quickly and is the perfect companion for practitioners, magistrates and judges alike and we continue to review the criminal procedure rules landscape at a challenging time.the statutes.

0439023491|5.0|A wonderful installment in the series.  I couldn't put it down.  I read the whole book in one sitting.
0345528581|5.0|I'll make this brief; the book is phenomenal, discusses nutrition, exercise routines and the minimalistic workout can be done virtually anywhere.  I'm done with a full workout in less time than it usually takes me to suit up and drive to the gym and back, which is excellent.  Furthermore, the quality of these body weight exercises is, in my opinion, superior to any gym equipment as it works the stabilizer muscles more and has a more balanced approach to true health.  Buy this book, not a gym membership.  You probably would only use your gym membership for a month or two anyway ;)
1423101502|5.0|I finished reading this action packed finale and I liked the whole series so much.  I found myself searching for more stories to read.  I immediately bought the first book for the next series from Rick Riordan.  He does such a wonderful job including so much greek mythology into the stories then I ever remembered from school, it feels like such a fitting extension to what the greeks actual believed.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|The reason for the three stars is there is nothing new on this CD.  They should have titled it Greatest Hits of Enya and been done with it.  I'm not saying the songs are terrible; I'm  just saying I already  have all the music on prior CD's.  Buy  it if you are a first time person listening to Enya.
0439023483|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend of mine and I had to keep reading until I had finished the whole series.  This is a very compelling story and I just couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This is one of her last CD's and it has a few gems in it.  If you liked her earlier stuff, you'll probably like this one.  I copied  a few  of the songs until another CD to enjoy them (there were a few songs on this CD that I just didn't care mch for).
1423113497|5.0|What a great series of books enjoyable for all ages. Rick Riordan expertly intertwines greek mythology into his stories for a fun and entertaining series.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|I really only like a couple songs on this CD.  It is not her best work by any means, but if you like her music, it is worth a try.  (I'd listen to various cuts first for free to see if  you really want it.)
B004DK49DW|4.0|This CD by Mike Ness and the guys is different from their previous albums. Songs like California (Hustle and Flow) have female backup singers for example, something that I did not expect. But even though the sound is a little bit different from past albums it is a nice mix of their older sounds and these new ones.
B000024V8E|4.0|Nothing great on this CD, nothing particularly bad, most just so so.  Still, if you like Enya, you probably should have it.
0307272702|4.0|The book was not an easy read but well worth the effort and I've lost 11 pounds in 3 weeks, (one of which was on vacation), but I tried my best to avoid the carbs.  As a senior citizen it is remarkable that I've lost that much in so little time without starving and not exercizing. The big difference, no fruit which seems to be the culprit in my past efforts.  I have experieced night leg cramps but have been helped by diet tonic water.  Not sure why.

B00007FOMP|4.0|After picking up Marvin Gaye's greatest hits, I had decided to find something else of his.  This was, quite frankly, the obvious choice.  I was not disappointed.    This is a great place to start if you want to delve deeper into his material besides the best of.  Many of the songs lead into each other, which means you should take the album as a comprehensive whole, not as just the \\"hits.\\"    Getting the Legacy Edition is not recommended if you are a novice to Marvin Gaye's music, only because the bonus material is pretty ancillary.  If you are a fan, get the Legacy Edition.  If you want a place to start, just get the regular CD.
B002RV01QI|5.0|If you like Enya, you probably own all the songs; if you are new to her and like New Age, buy it.  It has a lot of variety and samples all of her albums.  Pretty much all of her hits are on this CD.
0374158460|1.0|Tedious, unlikable characters.  I got through 200 pages and gave up.  At first I thought it must be me because it got such glowing reviews, but finally decided it was the book.  Sometimes, even with unlikable characters, I will keep reading because I want to see what happens.  But in this case, I didn't care.  Reading this was a huge waste of time.
B000J233SK|5.0|This is my favorite McKennett CD for numerous reasons; I especially like many of the songs (Like Mummy) as I can almost see the Arab belly dancer doing  her thing to this music.  The percussion, background instrumental sounds blend especially well with her voice.  This is a GREAT CD, probably my favorite of all New Age music (and I include people like Enya and Kate Price in this comment).

I did not use the included \\"EZ\\" software because that automatically only creates mp3 files at 192 kbps quality. Instead I used Audacity to record each side as a long \\"wav\\" file, and then combined them into one long \\"wav\\" file of the entire album. I then used Audacity to trim out some noise from the beginning of each side (where the needle hits the record), and to do some fade outs at the end of each track, take out the worst \\"pops\\", and to create some real silence between the tracks. I then saved the file with the improvements. I have Nero CD burning software, which comes with a Wave Editor which has some capabilities that Audacity doesn't. I imported the wav file into the Nero Wave Editor, and used it to automatically break the large file into individual tracks. I saved them as both individual wav files and as 320 kbps mp3 files. From there, I burned a CD using the wav files. Then I used a free mp3 tag editing software (mp3tag) to add the Album, Artist, Song Title, Year, and cover art to the mp3 files. Finally I imported those files into iTunes.    All of that sounds like a lot, and it did take some time, but I think it was worth it. I now have a very good sounding album that I can listen to digitally anytime I want. I was so impressed that I right away ordered more Discwasher D4+ fluid from Amazon so I can get started on some of the other albums I have that never made it to CD.    I will caution you that in order to use Audacity correctly, it will require some experimentation and in making some changes via your computer's Control Panel > Sounds and Audio Devices settings to correctly set the source and playback source. In Audacity you will need to go into Preferences as well and make some changes. But it IS worth the effort. I wish I had bought one of these ION turntables a long time ago. This particular model also allows you to plug in via 1/8\\" mini stereo jack, any other sound source, such as a tape deck, old reel to reel, or whatever, and digitize those as well.    No, this is not some $300 or more turntable for super audiophiles, but given what you can do with it for the price I highly recommend it. Be sure to clean your records as best as possible. This will go a long way to determining how well the final files will sound.
0671015206|5.0|My husband and I read this book when it was first published thirteen years ago.  Some years earlier, we had observed, with amusement, two wealthy relatives pour over newspaper ads for the cheapest fares to Palm Desert, where they would winter.  With such wealth, we could not believe that they spent a half an hour just to save a mere twenty or thirty bucks...ten percent of their purchase.  But someone pointed out to us that such careful frugality was how they had become millionaires to begin with.  So when \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" was published, I decided to learn about that frugality.      We already had practiced some of the habits of those who successfully accumulate wealth, but our lifestyle became more focussed after reading this book.  I can attest to the power of these practices.  When I read of baby-boomers who will have difficulty retiring (fewer than one in ten have saved over $100,000,) I know it doesn't apply to us, even though we have only the equivalent of a typical two-wage-earner income.  In fact, in my mid-fifties, I am already retired.  My husband will retire at age 62.  We have sent one child to the best college he could get into, a top-tier private university (read shockingly expensive!), and will soon send a second to a similar type of school.  Upon retirement, our monthly income will be about the same as our working income, and perhaps a bit higher.  We will need that income, because we plan to travel abroad regularly during our early retirement years.  We will also be relocating from a smallish city to a large metropolitan area, despite the higher cost of real estate.  Barring some unforseen circumstance, we will be able to afford these things, and in the event of some unforseen circumstance, we can weather that, too.    How did we do this?  The best, most cost-saving step we took was to live in a modest home, which significantly reduced our outlay for utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and furnishings.  Speaking of furnishings, we bought good quality furniture that we expected to last 'forever,' which it has.  Yes, Pottery Barn is great, but most of our original furniture is still fine and we don't replace what is still functional and intact.  We use paint and a few accent items to update the look, but no wholesale overhauls, because that is extravagent.  We buy nice cars and maintain them scrupulously, but drive them until they are no longer operable. In fact, most of what we buy is good to better quality...just to the point that we felt the added cost was more than compensated for by longevity, and even personal preferences.  We rarely go out to eat, but instead, purchase nice t-bone steaks and cook them at home.  With a kid still at home, we get pizza once a week or so, but even that is generally take-n-bake, which we prefer.  I rarely, rarely buy coffee out anymore...even when I was still working, I brought it to work in an old-fashioned device they used to have called a Thermos....well, okay it was a stainless steel thermos I got from Starbucks for $25.00...extravagant, no?...but it has lasted forever!    Though we live in a water-based recreational area, we tolerated a goofy little boat until a really good deal came along for a used boat.  We chose to forgo the recreational vehicle, the four-wheelers, the snowmobiles, the annual winter vacations, and extravagant summer vacations.  We usually wait until movies are out on net-flix or pay-per-view, but go to the theater now and then, particularly for movies that are best seen on the big screen.  We make our own repairs.  If we don't know how to do it, we learn how its done.  We prepare our own taxes.  We keep the thermostat set at 68, and at night 65.  We turn out the lights when we leave a room. Though we are somewhat extravagent gift-givers, but don't over-indulge in daily living. Every so often, we re-evaluate where we make purchases, because what was the best deal yesterday is not always the best deal today.  We comparison shop, becausewe know that every spending decision, however small, has an impact on our future.  We don't pay for services, such as banking, that we can get for free elsewhere. We avoid credit cards.  We understand how compounded interest adds up, whether you owe or are saving.    When our oldest child was in high school, we heard complaints...\\"so-and-so has this and that and the other thing, and I KNOW they don't make as much as we do!\\"  We always answered, \\"You know they have a boat and an RV in the driveway of their beautiful home near the country-club, but you don't know how much money they owe for that stuff.\\"  Well, this recession has told us ALL how much \\"they\\" owe...alot...and they can no longer pay for it, because they never COULD afford it.  Around us, we see people losing jobs, fretting about the retirement they cannot afford.  We see foreclosures, up-side-down mortgages, and fire sales of goods.  People do not have any savings to weather a financial downturn, let alone retire.  Sadly, the chicken has come home to roost.      We, in contrast, have not blinked an eye.  We are fine, and will remain fine.  Despite the recession, we have grown our retirement nest egg, which has reached the point where it is increasing remarkably quickly. Most of all, I appreciate the sense of well-being and confidence that comes from knowing that though we have sacrificed, we have been able to do the things that are the most important to us...educate our kids and save for retirement.  (And we had the money for things that weren't our priorities, but which had to be done...in the past eight years we replaced the furnace and air conditioner, re-roofed and re-painted the house, replaced the septic system, replaced various non-functioning appliances, and did a modest kitchen update, all paid for with cash.)     This book doesn't address societal problems related to the distribution of wealth, nor does it purport to. Neither does this book provide a blue-print for how to become wealthy.  It isa report of the habits of wealthy people...habits that are surprisingly frugal.  It is simply a collection of data that may influence the habits of those who read it.      So, if you read this book, will you become a millionaire?  No, not necessariy.  At least one of the earlier comments questions the idea that you can become a millionaire merely by acting like one.  Well, that certainly is true...it depends on your income.  But, you certainly aren't going to become a millionaire by spending all of your money.  Reading this book and practicing its tenents will simply put you in the best financial position you can attain, given your income.  It just takes prioritization and sacrifice.  Look at it this way...do you want to work forever, and make deep, difficult sacrifices for the last two, three, or four decades of your life?  Or would you like to establish a comfortable, more modest lifestyle that enables you to retire?  One that you can comfortably maintain until the end of your life?    I strongly, strongly suggest this book to anyone who is ready to take responsibility for their own financial well-being.  If you are a bit of a skeptic, just read it...it can't hurt...you might have to give up two or three lattes to purchase the book, but that is just the first step in decision-making that will get you to your retirement goals.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|What a superb film produced by Clint Eastwood with some amazing effects, yes you have to stick with the story line at first as the story lines are developed and then come together. I had no problem with keeping French dialogue with subtitles, Matt Damon great as usual with some fine acting and the best brought out of the young London actors!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie was EXCELLENT! Richard Armitage is a great actor and such a cutie. Dare I say I like him better than Colin Firth in P&P????...I do!
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|If I had gone to watch \\"The Tourist\\" in the cinema I would have walked out and asked for my money back, bad acting and a total uninteresting story line, seemed more desperation to do a movie with top movie stars! I am no Johnny Depp fan and I think he is over rated and this performance confirms the fact¬!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I have never given a review on a cd before but, for Janelle Monae's  Archandroid I had to.  I purchased this cd in March of 2011.  I started playing it in April 2011 cannot stop.   I love, love, love this cd.  It's so.....different and I can listen from beginning to end not skipping one song.  She should be selling millions of albums.  Don't sleep on this keeper.  Pure Genius!
B000002H72|4.0|Thi s a very strong album, full of creative ideas that only seem to come together on a few tracks (Debaser, Waves of Mutilation, Here Comes Your Man, and Dead).
B004QYZATW|1.0|The only explanation for Depp agreeing to participate in this abomination is that he needed quick cash for a new yacht or property in Montana.  This movie must have filled some sort of gap in his otherwise busy schedule.<br /><br />Talk about a waste of talent.  This is probably one of the most weakly acted movies in the past decade by all involved.  Jolie was little more than catatonic throughout the whole movie.  Depp was visibly bored in a few scenes.  My guess is he was distracted by which paint scheme to go with for the new boat.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Great tourism video for Venice.  I'd like to visit someday.<br />-Slow motion boat chase was totally riveting.  Way better than the Bourne movies' chase scenes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Jolie is pretty.  Did you really need to cake all of that makeup on her?  Did they hire a circus makeup artist for this movie?<br /><br />Please save your money and skip this one.  $3.99 and 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.
B0045EJY90|5.0|I bought this CD player specifically for one reason; to play music on USB drives through my home stereo. Being old I have never fully embraced keeping my music on an mp3 player, iPod or Cloud and playing it through small headphones or on a little stereo with a dock does not sound very good. I have a large collection of CD's and keep copies of them on a 150 Gig external hard drive attached to my home PC. (I also use the external drive to back up the PC).<br /><br />I like to hear my music on a home stereo or in my car on a pretty good stereo. The most efficient way for me to do that is transfer the music onto an USB drive via my home computer and plug the USB thumb drive into a USB jack to play the music. I know I could play an MP3 or iPod through my home and car stereos and through the USB port, for me that is more trouble than it should be.<br /><br />My car stereo will shortly have a USB jack in the front as I am upgrading, I needed an easy way to play the same music at home as in my car and carry it in a simple drive w/o battery or connection worries.<br /><br />There are very few component stereo units that have a USB port on the front. The TEAC CD-P650 does and for $150 costs less than what I paid for my last CD player 5 years ago. I simply added the TEAC to my component stack plugged in the included RCA cables and select Video source(my existing 5 CD player is using CD source) it plays my music beautifully.<br /><br />The screen displays song, artist and track number, a nice bonus is the TEAC CD player sounds much better than my existing CD player. Love it.<br /><br />A little expensive for a way to play USB drives but for my needs it is perfect. My son bought me a 16 Gig USB thumb drive for my birthday apparently that will hold 3000 songs, that should do.
B004SBX112|2.0|Loved it even with ads, once I upgraded the game has become very messy.  It freezes up all the time, goes unresponsive.  It was faster and smoother with ads.
1423107233|5.0|As others have said, this book focuses on storyboards rather than the actual story of Disney's animated features, but that shouldn't throw anyone off or disappoint them, considering how gorgeous everything in this book is. I had Story on my wish list for a few months, but the second I heard it was out of print, I rushed and got it before Animation, which was going to be my original first purchase in this series. I'm glad I did, as Story has genuine treasures, and every single page here is a masterpiece. Story is also a true art book, as the only real text in the book (aside from labels on the artwork) is an introduction by John Lasseter, and then the final pages and index listing what's on what page and artist credits. There are no pages talking about the storyboard process, how hard something was to explain with storyboards or to put in animated form, nothing of that sort. What you get are huge pictures of the storyboards with their respective notes, if any, and you can take in the artwork in all its glory.    I hate to sound like a Disney fanboy here, but this book really is gorgeous to look at. It single-handedly got me back into drawing, and I enjoyed being taken back in time and seeing bits from some features I hadn't seen in ages. Even the we'll-probably-never-see-it-on-dvd Song of the South is featured in here! So many Disney films and shorts are shown here that it serves as a time capsule of sorts, starting out with Steamboat Willie and ending with Lilo & Stitch. I can't even talk about what my favorite pieces were in here because honestly, that'd be about 90% of the book. Storyboards for the bear fight from The Fox and the Hound, Ferdinand the Bull sitting in the arena with his flower, Pluto on trial in Pluto's Judgment Day...there's so much here! And you gotta love how there are a lot of foldout pages to give more pictures of a given storyboard. Though as pointed out by others, this book doesn't include complete storyboards for scenes- it cuts off and goeson to the next title pretty quickly. But I can't complain, though it would be nice if somehow they managed to get complete storyboards for every Disney film and put out books of those...    If you still haven't picked up Story, you should before prices go through the roof. My only real complaint is that the books in this series are oversized and hang off my book shelf a couple of inches. It doesn't affect the score by any means, and it's not even really a complaint I guess, but I do like having my books be around the same size. Still, Disney fans or animation students NEED to get this. It's a true treasure.
B004G6009U|5.0|Loved it!!  Truly the words to describe this latest Disney release.  It was delightful to watch with my 3 1/2 year-old granddaughter.  Not the \\"dark\\" Disney of my youth--as I look back at the Disney Classics, I find that they were rather graphic and scary when it came to demonizing death.  Can't wait to see Tangled again!!
0525951652|5.0|Despite the nine hundred pages of the book, i've had an amazing time with this book. Like the other historical book from this author, this one is very good. In fact I believe that Ken Follet achieves his maximum potencial when writes books like this one. I've read other books from him, like the eye of needle and the fly of the eagle, but this one anda the pillars of the earths are much better. You won't regret spending all the time needed to go trough all the book.
1595141715|5.0|Clay gets a mysterious package in the mail. It's a box containing old-fashioned cassette tapes. Hannah, a girl who recently committed suicide, recorded the tapes shortly before her death. On them she lists her reasons for killing herself, and Clay is one of her reasons. Clay listens with sadness, anger, and shock as Hannah recounts how thirteen people hurt her in some way, causing her to stop caring about her existence.<br /><br />The novel is suspenseful. As Clay plays each tape, I was waiting for the tape that would reveal his connection to Hannah's suicide. This book is sad and depressing, but in a good way. When a book, movie, or song touches me deeply it accesses emotions that I normally don't feel. And all this from a debut author! Asher is an amazing writer. Hats off to him.
159102594X|5.0|I was ready to get back into a fantasy series and searched Amazon for recommended books. I read the reviews for Joe Abercrombie's series The First Law, and I hoped that the critics were right. I gave it a shot and ordered the whole series and I was certainly not disappointed. I was AMAZED. His writing style, character development, plots with it's turns and intertwining story lines had me so captivated. I read all three in less than 2 months. After the Blade Itself, there is NO putting down the next two. I eagerly await more fantasy series from this truly talented author. I would recommend HIGHLY to anyone looking for a fun ride with endearing cast of misfits, and countless violent & ruthless encounters. A++ I LOVE THIS SERIES!

B004MOMT2M|2.0|DVD Audio version: I have a fairly high end 7.1 system with a 250W sub-woofer. What can I say. Clarity is a bit better than a remasterd CD. Surround field is essentially non-existent; a bit used on Camera Eye and Vital Signs. Limelight seems to have the most clarity increase. Overall I find it a bit muddled for a DVD-Audio. Geddy's bass is very low. I'll probably send it back.    I have an older Pioneer DVD-Audio/Video player so the album tracks can only be played thru the analog multi-channel inputs. The videos can be played 5.1 thru the optical inputs (they are not 96k).
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a workhorse. Razor sharp out of the box, durable, thick, carbon steel blade. Yes, the handle is very thick. My hands are medium - borderline large, and can hold onto it firmly with no problems, though if the handle were any bigger I wouldn't be able to grip it with confidence for heavy duty work. Smaller hands might not be able to grip this as well because the handle is very thick.    The sheath is plastic (possibly Kydex), and very good quality.    I had beaten on this knife for a while, and like it so much it's earned a place in my 3 day emergency bag. This is the knife you will have no qualms about depending on if your survival is at stake. Fire bow drill making, shelter building, fire wood chopping, cleaning fish and game. This knife can do it, though the fish and game is better left to a thinner blade it will work if it's all you have.    For about $60, it's very reasonably priced. I've spent twice as much on knives that don't perform half as well as this one does. Value is off the charts good. This knife could sell for $150 and easily still be worth the money.    It is a carbon steel blade. So oil it up after using so it doesn't start to rust.    This is a fairly large blade. You may wish to carry a smaller knife for more precision cutting tasks. With the BK2 and ESEE Izula, all my needs are met.
0765356139|5.0|A coworker mentioned Mistborn and I decided to read it just to see if there were any decent fantasy/sci fi books out there.  I just finished reading all three in a row, and they rank as one of my favorites.  Amazingly creative, well written, unique, exciting, thought provoking.  I can't wait to read others from the author and hope he continues to give us such wonderful works.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|Ok, it isn't the long running series of books. But for those of us that did't read those books this was a not bad show for a TV horror show.<br /><br />A cop was shot and went into a coma, when he wakes up the world has gone zombie on him. now he has to figure everything out and find his wife and kid amongst it all.<br /><br />there is some decent acting in here, though my gripe with that is they all apear to be souther hicks willing to go crazy with a gon 'cuz daddy tought 'em how to use it, when they know that will bring the zombies running. kind of like a zombie dinner bell<br /><br />i wish (and home that) there was more to this. there are only 5 episodes and nothing telling us what actually happened in the first place. we will see in season 2 i hope.

0765315246|2.0|Old Man's War leans dangerously close to Star Wars, in my opinion. Like Heinlein in Star Ship Troopers, Scalzi inexplicably feels the need to have humans fighting face to face with aliens. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENCE. For example, why not use drones? Why not use NUCLEAR WEAPONS? Are they really afraid of radiation - they can't deal with cancer? Blach! The idea that humans would go land on a planet with rifles, line up, and shoot at the aliens like the soldiers in Napoleon's arms is weapon grade balonium. The attempt to add hand to hand combat + sci fi is too contrived. 4/5 for a fantasy novel, but 2/5 for science fiction.    If you want good sci fi, read books descended from Asimov, not Heinlein.

B004SF30HI|5.0|This soundtrack features the two main rhythms of Rio de Janeiro, Samba and Bossa Nova, and blends traditional and current music.  Besides, it pleases both parents and children (my 3 year old son loves dancing to the sound of \\"I Want to Party\\").  As others have mentioned, you need to watch the movie before you buy this soundtrack.  In my opinion this is the best animated film soundtrack I've ever seen.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It worked great on my Samsung Fascinate. I really enjoyed it &amp; hope there will be more games like this soon. I don't understand all the negative reviews.

B004P52NP6|5.0|\\"Forevermore\\" is the brand new, 11th studio album by legendary hard rock outfit \\"Whitesnake\\". \\"Foevermore\\" is the second post-reunion album of the band a follow-up to \\"Good to be bad\\" (2008), while also marking their debut release under \\"Frontiers Records\\". \\"Whitesnake\\", in good tradition deliver once again a high quality blues-hard rock album that still manages to sound differentiated from its predecessor.<br /><br />For that matter the composing core of the band has remained stable since the previous album with David Coverdale and guitarist Doug Aldrich being responsible for the majority of the material; performance-wise the contribution of guitarist Reb Beach has increased with clear presence on the solos, complementing ideally Doug's parts. David's voice is in good form, as expected and delivers with the class and style that he is renowned for. In addition the blues-groove has been given a boost on \\"Forevermore\\" with occasional use of slide guitar on the riffs, but mostly due to the new rhythm section of drummer Brian Tichy and bassist Michael Devin. The new rhythm section is perhaps lighter in comparison to the previous but more versatile, capable of taking a blues verse into a melodic rock chorus.<br /><br />And choruses are once again key for \\"Whitesnake\\", striking melodic rock/AOR gold with just about any song on \\"Forevermore\\" be it the opener \\"Steal your heart away\\", \\"I need you\\", the video highlight of \\"Love will set you free\\", never forgetting the ballads \\"Easier said than done\\" and \\"Fare Thee well\\" and of course \\"Dogs in the street\\" the most pleasantly surprising song on the album built on the speeding hard rock vibe of late 80s \\"Whitesnake\\" songs like \\"Bad Boys\\" and \\"Kittens got Claws\\".<br /><br />Needless to say, \\"Frevermore\\" is a must for any fan of hard rock, blues rock, melodic rock and AOR, capturing all that is characteristic of \\"Whitesnake\\" and still deliver more potential classics to the fans.`
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun game where you have to find items to unlock doors and figure out how to use items to unlock little mysteries and find grandpa. Very entertaining. My whole family was fighting over this one! :-)

B0025KVLVA|3.0|this recording of substandard quality.  flat, hollow and lackluster.  have other beatle cd's with much better sound.  sounds as if they used the (unremastered) masters.  only bought it for one song - rain.[[ASIN:B0025KVLVA Past Masters (Remastered)]]
B00004XMTJ|5.0|After much debate and delay, I finally ordered this movie - before it gets any more expensive!  I love the music.  I can only think of one song I don't like - Gus' song - though it's supposed to be well done in this - but I doubt it.  However despite Amazon's official review, I do not expect to find ALW's music to be revealed as \\"twaddle\\"!  A common objection I've read to this movie is that it wasn't expanded - it's done like a filmed stage show.  For me, that's a plus.  I also love \\"Evita\\" - the music - I would have bought that long ago, but I've seen some of it - the outdoor shots - like \\"Cats\\",  want it to be filmed \\"onstage\\" - I prefer it.  In my opinion, \\"Camelot\\" (one of my all-time, childhood favorites) was destroyed by Hollywood - I can't stand the movie - with Redgrave's voice replacing Julie Andrews', no Burton, no Roddy MacDowall, and most of the songs cut! My flick of \\"Cats\\" will probably be here in a couple of days, and I'm looking forward.  Oh.  One thing that did turn me off - apparently lots of the singing in it is dubbed - that nearly kept me from buying it - I only hope they did a good job.<br /><br />It came and I watched it.  Fantastic.  A glorious 2 hours of singing and dancing.  Kept thinking the people in it must have been brilliant, to have learned all those steps (much in unison, subtle, slight movements) for a continuous 2 hours.  The lip-sinching was perfectly fine (if in fact there was any).  No booklet or info, just the disc in a box.  Wonderful anyway.  Highly recommended if there is anyone left alive who hasn't already seen it!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Once I finally got past the force closes, the game seemed fine. I WISH I could review it properly, but it only ever worked three times and the third time I opened it, it didn't read that I had played it so I had to start over. Wonderful. Countless force closes and now it can't even read my save. On top of the force closes, it never reads my sound settings. Nothing like having some crappy mood music blaring because it decided for me that I needed the sound on despite me changing the volume the three times it worked. I'm glad I got this as a free app; I've used command line programs that are easier on me.
0525422943|5.0|If I Stay was one of those books that punched me in my gut and made me cry. I thought the ending was perfect, but it made me think about it for days of what would happen to Mia and Adam now that she chose to stay. When I heard there was going to be a follow-up, I freaked!<br /><br />Reading from Adam's point of view was awesome. He was already one of my favorite male characters to begin with, but this book made me fall in love with him. Hearing his voice in my head, knowing all the pain and anxiety he had with how his dream had came about and his life with Mia....*sighs* Forman wrote one of the most realistic guys ever.<br /><br />Mia pissed me off when I first got into the book. My mind kept racing on how she could possible leave Adam the way she did. As the story unfolds, you could practically feel the pull these two have for one another and how badly the tension is. Plus the book is based on one night of seeing each other which is hard to pull off, but Forman does it beautifully. She manages to weave in enough back story and present time to make you really understand where both characters are coming from.<br /><br />It's hard for me not to compare the two books together. If I Stay was such an emotional roller coaster. The mere mention of Mia's family in this book had me in tears. But Where She Went held more quiet punches. It's also one of the best examples of showing how much a tragedy can take a hold of your life. I still favor the first book more, but when I skimmed through this one a second time, I couldn't help but falling in love with it all over again. And the music! I loved reading the lyrics, making the tune of how they would go inside my head.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone to read the follow-up. If you haven't read the first book then you need to get your hands on it ASAP so you can get to this one!
1591843790|4.0|I suppose the problem with publishing a book entitled \\"Enchantment\\" is that it sets very high expectations for the reader.  It had better be enchanting!  Alas for the author, this book is only quite good.<br /><br />After a slow start and a chapter or two on being likable and trustworthy, the book picked up steam and was quite good on topics such as launching, overcoming resistance, and using push and pull technologies.  The last chapters on enchanting your employees and your boss and how to resist being enchanted by the unscrupulous (a surprising choice for a chapter in this book!) were, dare I say it, quite enchanting.<br /><br />My copy of the book is autographed and Kawasaki choose to autograph the cover with the reminder \\"Resisting you is futile!\\" - which I thought was a great touch.
B001AZI1W8|5.0|Number one this is good music for the most part.  Also, she's very sexy in a classy, sort of elegant way.  The dancing, choreography and stage show are all very nicely done. Surprised at the wailing guitar work.  Sounds like she has Steve Vai light in her stable of musicians.  Would be nice if he had his own style but then he probably wouldn't be playing for a pop star. ;)  This is my first foray into Rihanna and this was enough to earn my respect and then some.
B003S9GOWS|5.0|First of all, prospective buyers should be aware that this essential Rubinstein set is still available in its earlier incarnation at just about the same bargain-basement price: [[ASIN:B000026OW3 The Chopin Collection]]. By taking better advantage of the space available, this new set has ten discs vs eleven in the earlier compilation, however, the contents are identical. The older set, which is made up of bulky multi-disc jewel cases, includes an excellent set of liner notes with essays on both Rubinstein and Chopin, whereas this new space-saving box has no notes. Finally, both sets are made from digital remasters by Rubinstein's long time producer, Max Wilcox.     Since there are numerous amazon reviews appended to the earlier set, I'll keep my remarks to a minimum here. That Rubinstein was still at the top of his form at the time the earliest of the RCA stereo sessions were recorded is attested to by the tremendous Ballades and Scherzos from 1959. Rubinstein plays these pieces with absolute authority, from both a technical and musical perspective. These were reference recordings for many years, and with good reason. The same is true of the piano concertos. The best way to describe them is that they are very sturdy but elegant, completely fresh and inspired, splashed with poetic touches and also have plenty of muscle in the virtuoso passages. The Polonaises, which were recorded in 1964, are also quite muscular, but never overplayed - that Rubinstein was 77 at the time seems a footnote. And so on.     Not everything is ideal here: for example, I've never been all that fond of Rubinstein's studio recordings of the two sonatas (a recital performance of the B-flat minor from 1961 shows the pianist in a completely different light: [[ASIN:B000059M5B Rubenstein Performs in Concert]]); and the 1946 preludes, the only set he recorded, are not among the best that I've heard. But these are minor exceptions compared to the treasures in this collection. Just listen to the Andante Spianato and Grand Polonaise from 1964, a riveting combination of virtuosity, elegance and gorgeous tone. That's what Rubinstein was all about.    There are many fine Chopin recordings in the catalog, however, so highly regarded were most of these Rubinstein recordings that for decades they were the standard by which all others were measured. Have they been superceded? Maybe, but, like virtually all of the music in this extraordinary collection, they have a strong advantage in that they reflect what must have been thousands of performances by the great Chopin pianist going back fifty or more years.    Five stars.
B00466HN6S|3.0|This is one of those movies where the trailers (coming attractions) get you to want to see the movie, and then once you've sat through the movie you realize that you saw all the best stuff in the trailers.<br /><br />The visuals are first rate.  The Easter Factory is awesome.  The bunnies are adorable, and the \\"Pink Berets\\" were one of a number of great ideas.<br /><br />But the bottom line is that after the movie while we were walking out of the theater I asked my two boys -- age 10 and 8 -- to rate it on a scale of 1 for the worst and 10 for the best, and they each gave it a 5.<br /><br />In fact, the 8 year old just walked up to my computer screen and thought I was buying the movie.  I asked him if he's ever want to see it again, and he said \\"no\\".  The real irony here is that buying the movie would have cost about half of what it costs to get an adult and two kids to see a movie in the theater these days where I live.<br /><br />So you've got great visuals, cutting-edgs CGI cuteness everywhere, and some fun ideas, but you've allow got shallow characters and a very contrived story whose writers could not conceive a way for the Easter Bunny to visit all the children of the world without copying Santa Clause, even though the bunnies have a globe spanning ultra high-speed tunnel network that can get them anywhere on Earth in seconds.<br /><br />Oh, and this is one of those movies where they give away the ending at the beginning and then use the movie to show you \\"how it all went down\\".  Wow, nothing like knowing how the movie will end right from the get go.  Brilliant.<br /><br />This movie is like one of those hollow chocolate Easter bunnies that you got when you were a kid not realizing that they were hollow.  You think you've really got somethng awesome, you unwrap it, and then you bite in and it caves in and you realize that hype and the reality can be very different.  It's maybe worth watching later when you're just desperate for a way to pass time with the kids, but I wouldn't pay good money to own it and store it for years.store it for years.

0811879542|5.0|On the opening page of PRESS HERE, the reader sees a simple yellow dot on a clean white background and the simple words that invite the reader to \\"Press here and turn the page.\\"  I challenge anyone not to be tempted to \\"press here\\".  Once you do \\"press here\\" and turn the page the journey has begun.  Each page invites the reader, to press, rub, shake, tilt, or blow on the page.  Each time, readers are rewarded with some kind of action on the subsequent page.  Rubbing the yellow dot may make it change color.  Shaking it moves all of the dots around.  And blowing on the page just might send all of the dots flying.  Every time I share this book with someone, I get the same response - smiles, chuckles, and enthusiastic interaction with the book.    There are books and then there are books. PRESS HERE is fun, simple, and brilliantly executed. In some ways, I like to describe this as an iPad app for people without an iPad.  It should be noted that the book is designed in a way that also allows for heavy use.  With a book that encourages interactions, it is critical that it can stand up to lots of handling.  The pages of PRESS HERE are thicker and coated which will support frequently use.      If you are looking for gifts for young children in your life, or just like collecting unique books, I would seriously recommend this one.  I am already making up a list of who will get a copy.

B00479SVBU|5.0|Great product!  I have an older car stereo (still has a tape deck for crying out loud) and was looking for a solution to my lack of music selection.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- small footprint - no worries about it fitting anywhere<br />- input/output - ability to plug in a separate MP3 player, also can plug into an AUX jack if you have one.  The sound will be clearer if you go AUX, but I'd rather not have the wires<br />- solid build - it's light but solid - i'm not worried about breaking it<br />- SD and USB support - you'll won't have any problems bringing all your music with you<br />- sound - I've used FM transmitters before, and they can be touch and go.  This one does a great job.  It clips occasionally when you have it on a frequency that isn't full static, but otherwise is awfully clear for coming through an FM channel<br />- screen - plenty clear and able to adjust contrast.  Shows freq, track name, artist, time left and folder<br />- POWER BUTTON - I was amazed at how many other products did not have a power button.  Also, i saw another poster said that it would turn on automatically when you turned your car on.  Mine doesn't.  It stays off until I turn it back on.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- screen - not a whole lot to look at.  It shows what it needs, but no options to change how it looks<br />- sound - you're using an FM transmitter.  If you're looking for crystal clear, perfectly balanced sound, then you're looking in the wrong place.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No playlist support that I've been able to find so far<br />- Shuffle doesn't do so hot.  You start hitting the same songs pretty often, and never hear others.<br /><br />Overall, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a way to take all you music with you without needing to worry about wires, CD's or expensive hardware.
B0039TD7PY|1.0|I've got to agree with others who have panned the sound quality of this CD.  Even allowing for the fact that this is a live recording, the quality is terrible.  It is so fuzzy that I first thought there was something defective about the CD or with my system.  These are great artists and for the most part wonderful songs, but the poor recording quality makes it barely listenable.  Unless you are a truly dedicated fan, don't buy this CD.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|Catering to the Lowest Denominator  This film is so cheesy it is practically a parody of bad action films.  The first 15 minutes are painfully trite and play more like a television drama episode than a planned narrative film.  The first scene shows a half-naked Angelina Jolie being tortured to the delight of perverts everywhere.  Then she is back in her desk job where lives out her normal spy life talking spy things to the mail boy and introducing herself as a spy so the political prisoners...I guess anonymity isn't an issue when you're a spy?  Then we have happy homemaker spy and evil Russians who (gasp) kidnap innocent children and train them to be assassins.   They might as well have thrown in the hero defeating Nazis and rescuing orphans and puppies while saving the whales and ending global warming.  Trying to list all the plot holes in this waste of film would take an eternity, so I'll just point out the bad film-making and poor decisions:    1. I counted four painfully long exposition monologues and dialogues, including a 20 minute ending which clearly should have been cut.  2. The character's behavior is completely out of character for a spy and her motivations are either lacking or idiotic (I'm going to kill secret service agents in order to NOT kill the president to let him know I'm NOT a killer!).  3. Took about three seconds to figure out who the bad guy was...maybe you can beat my time.  4. A SHOE KNIFE!!??!!  5. Jolie's wigs were awful.  Only one look worked for her in the film, and it was not the gender-bending one which I found disturbingly unreal.    While I'm surprised that so many people seem to like this stupid and pointless movie, I'm more pissed that filmmakers who underestimate audiences to the point that they must believe us all to be drooling inbred imbeciles seem to be continuously vindicated by the success of the crap they serve to us.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|It's pretty hard to argue with the science. Unless one wants to start proclaiming that Taubes is out and out lying to us in order to reach some sort of evil aim, this latest book is a definitive read on, well, why we get fat and what to do about it. I have been a convinced reader of Taubes ever since reading 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' a year or two ago. Many people who believe in a controlled-carb way of eating, follow an Atkins or Atkins-variation type way of eating. Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution (DANDR) is considered among the pantheon of 'diet' books. In it, Dr. Atkins laid out his 'way' and said, basically, \\"This is what works and my experience and research supports this, trust me!\\". Taubes, in Good Calories, Bad Calories (GCBC), basically said, \\"Here's everything ever done on the science, research, and politics of nutrition.\\" It was a pretty dense read but enlightening to those who made the effort to follow and understand. As a sort of scientific investigative journalist, Taubes was exhaustive in his research and following the trail. His interpretation of the results is hard to argue with. However, as earlier stated, GCBC is a pretty intense read. 'Why We Get Fat: And What to do About It' really bridges the HOW of DANDR with the WHY of GCBC in an easy and enticing read. WWGF tells you why and says, \\"Here's what the science tells us and here's what it means to you\\". I never believed that I would recommend a 'diet' book as being a page-turner I couldn't put down 'til I found out how it all ended but I found myself spell-bound and read it cover to cover in two sittings. I'll definitely be reading and referring to it again and again in the future. Even those already well-versed in the way of controlled-carb eating will find this an informative read. We've known that 'X' is the way things work but sometimes not really easily understood the why of it. Taubes not only reinforces that 'X' does indeed work but also says, 'Y' is the reason -- all in a clear, concise essay.<br /><br />Note for the Kindle readers: This entire book is well laid out and formatted for the Kindle version. If all Kindle books were this well formatted, I might never buy another hard-copy book ever again.essay.

0790742780|4.0|I skipped this when it played in theaters, mostly because the critics I most trusted didn't much like it, and I wasn't much interested in mainstream Hollywood at that time, living in a big city where I could see EVERYTHING; and I never much cared for Michael Douglas.  I don't exactly remember my reactions to it when I saw it first on video, except that it was definitely better than I'd expected.  A rewatch about five years ago had me really appreciating Douglas' performance, but still having some qualms about the social commentary aspects.<br /><br />The third time was the charm.  While I still have some issues with this - I'm not fond of some of the police station stuff - I do like Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin in their roles a lot, but I think some of the attempted comparisons between Duvall & Douglas are a little forced, and Tuesday Weld's cameo seems shrill and almost cruel - there aren't many other criticisms I'd make.  I think that if you can get into 'D-Fens's head, and see through his eyes, and see the whole thing as something of a satire on how we all try to pretend that we empathize with each others' very different troubles and life-situations, it really works.  Schumacher's eye for the various landscapes/cityscapes of L.A. is piercing and really gives us a sense that it's a gigantic devil's playground, and the overall growing sense of foreboding and doom is palpable.<br /><br />But all of that would mean nothing if the central performance wasn't up to snuff, and fortunately it is.  It seems that a lot of people have come around to thinking that this is Douglas' finest moment as an actor and I couldn't agree more (based on having seen only a small fraction of his output to be fair).  It's not just an angry-white-guy character, there's a world of pain in here, and it's never entirely clear that this guy's a raving right-wing maniac, or a racist, or...what.  He's confused, angry, hurt, and his mania has been growing, and that's nicely detailed in the screenplay which helps to increase the complexity and nuance of this character over the course of the film.  I think it's useful when we want to damn people like Mel Gibson to think, well, maybe there are some good intentions, but the cracks that have opened up have allowed to let those demons of racism or other prejudice or hatreds out.  D-Fens is a great example of this kind of personality, one that I think a lot of us have buried deep inside us, though most of us are able to keep it under control.<br /><br />Anyway I'd like to write more about this one sometime, but I think I'll stop at this.  I still wouldn't quite name this a great film, as I think it is a little too confused, and sometimes too blunt, for it's own good.  But it's solid, thought-provoking entertainment, and Douglas' performance certainly IS great.  The DVD is as others have mentioned pretty bare-bones; this would profit from a good commentary track I think, especially if Schumacher and Douglas could be persuaded to do it.  Well, it's worth a look, or maybe several looks, regardless, and it's a film that I suspect will continue to grow in reputation as a document of the times.lps to increase the complexity and nuance of this character over the course of the film.

0691142165|4.0|Lots of fascinating information and graphs. However, this book is not for the casual reader. The style is highly academic. The graphs often take a while to decipher. The captions could have been clearer; I spent 10 minutes on one graph just trying to figure out what it was describing, as the axes weren't clearly labeled.<br /><br />Excellent for providing some perspective on economic history. Too many economists seem to have the idea that economic history started only 30 or 40 years ago and that nothing before that really matters.<br /><br />For a book with the subtitle \\"Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\\" there was surprisingly little treatment of economic crises in years earlier than 1800. I understand that quantitative data is hard to come by, but certainly some data is available.<br /><br />Great for economists and those interested in economic history.

0143038583|3.0|This is a book well worth reading if you want a better understanding of where the food on your plate comes from. You probably also need to be prepared for hard facts about the industrial food processes that dominate our western cultures. In many ways this book s certainly eye opening as the author follows the food trail from its first principles all the way through to the dinner plate.<br /><br />I found the first section of the book very enlightening and an excellent read. In this part the author focused on the ins trialization of our food and how much the chain of what we eat has changed. He also details how in many ways we fail to appreciate what we are actually consuming in the name of convenience. There is plenty of facts and figures to illustrate what modern food has become.<br /><br />However, I found the later sections of the books not as compelling as the first part. I commend the author for taking the path he did when examining the food chain but felt that it wasn't as though provoking as in the initial part. This later part was more about one person's journey rather than an in depth examination of the consequences of the modern food chain.<br /><br />I would however recommend that people read the book if they are at all interested in understanding more about the food they eat and hot may potentially be very different from what you imagine. I would have liked to see deep analysis and tracking of what was exposed in the initial section but the journey the does take is interesting but perhaps not overly compelling.
0061474355|4.0|There are good reasons why Garth Nix's fantasy about a girl who battles evil beings from the realm of Death as she searches for her barely living father should have gained a faithful following. Though Nix uses elements common to many fantasies, he succeeds by creating a unique yet convincing world, fashioning a main character we can hold to our hearts, and secondary characters that inject just enough humor and romance to keep things from getting too dreary. That's not to say this is a literary masterpiece, but it's damn good entertainment. Let's take a look at what works, and what its limitations are.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS<br /><br />1. Nix's world: It's fascinatingly poised, not only between life and death, but between the past and the present. A rustic army, evocative of World War I, guards a border between the Old Kingdom and a country named Ancelstierre; like most fun fantasy novels there's a cool map showing the layout. The army has guns and motor vehicles, but often have to resort to using swords, arrows, etc. to fight off the magically endowed beings from Death. Magic comes from something called the Charter, a kind of magical religion Nix never completely explains, and Sabriel is born into a line of Charter sorcerers called the Abhorsen, whose task it is to fight dark magic with light magic and send dead things back to Death permanently.<br /><br />In Nix's cosmology, one doesn't cross a river to enter Death: Death IS the river, and as it carries your soul along you pass through a number of gates; pass through the Seventh Gate and you're an absolute goner. As a child Sabriel spent time with her father in Death, which explains their pale skin. For reasons having to do with Charter Magic, it's easier to traverse Death in the Old Kingdom, both for the Abhorsen and the \\"Free Magic\\" zombie-like beings who devour living humans to keep themselves alive.<br /><br />The world of The Old Kingdom/Ancelstierre is tightly focused. There are vague references to the civilized lands further south, away from the Old Kingdom, where presumably the very idea of Magic is pooh-poohed. What lives north of the Old Kingdom is never touched on, nor what lies across the seas to the east and west. Nix's world draws its defining presence by the Border, which like many borders is rife with tension. Other fantasies--I'm thinking Neil Gaiman's Stardust--feature a border between two worlds. But Nix's is unique in that one side of the border has a foot in two worlds, making for a spooky uncertainty once one crosses that border.<br /><br />2. Nix's protagonist: Sabriel is sincere and likeable, passionate and determined, and unfazed by the horrors thrown at her. To work magic over things from Death she uses a set of named bells that hang on a bandolier draped over her shoulder. This invention serves not only to draw us into this world, they become part of Sabriel's character. They give us an immediate visual and auditory impression of her.<br /><br />2. Secondary characters: Another major character is a cat named Mogget, who helps Sabriel despite the fact that he is really a devil ensorcelled by her father--a devil who, once unleashed, wants nothing more than to destroy Sabriel. This adds interesting tension, and partly explains Mogget's contradictory behavior. (On the other hand, he IS a cat...)<br /><br />The third major character is a prince named Touchstone, whom Sabriel rescues from a 200-year spell, spent bound up as a ship's prow: an interesting inversion of the Sleeping Beauty trope. Unfortunately I didn't find Touchstone's character to be as interesting. Until he comes through in the end and shows his Magic stuff, he's kind of a clueless klutz. I actually found a more interesting male character to be Colonel Horyse (does Nix have a thing about horses?), a kind-hearted army officer whose job is to defend the Quotidian World with weapons that are pretty useless once a Big Nasty crosses the border in a wave of rolling fog (much like a Death Metal concert, come to think of it).<br /><br />3. Nix's style: His third-person narrative is sympathetic, sometimes dryly humorous and sometimes highly evocative, but never over-the-top. It's an easy read; his prose flows smoothly, and I didn't find my mind wandering; nor did his lack of explaining things like Charter Magic get in the way. His unnamed narrator feels comfortable in his world, and tells the story without making an issue of being a storyteller. For me, the one character in the story who feels closest to the narrator to is Colonel Horyse.<br /><br />LIMITATIONS<br /><br />This is an uncomplicated story: no perspective jumping, different voices, extended flashbacks, or other narrative tricks. His main character, though strong and true, displays few nuanced inner conflicts or personality traits. And in the popular tradition that demands Good and Evil, there's no doubting the evil nature of the Mordicant or Kerrigor, the two great Death antagonists Sabriel has to defeat. The only ambiguous character in the tale is Mogget, who lacks the sophisticated complexity of, say, a Severus Snape.<br /><br />More importantly, Nix draws on material that has a well-worn, comic book quality: the heroine suffering at the disgusting hands of an Evil Lord who desires her; the demons with fires in their mouths, the cowering townfolk beset by evil things, magic swords, etc. For younger fans who crave this sort of thing, such tropes are positive, not negative, but they do relegate Sabriel to fantasy genre status. While I have yet to read the other volumes in the series, I wouldn't expect them to explore ambiguous heroes or turn Good vs. Evil on its head.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you like fantasy, with well-drawn worlds and interesting characters, Sabriel is a good read. And if you like Death and stuff like that, it's a great read. If you don't like fantasy, hey, there's always Pride and Prejudice...right?rd-person narrative is sympathetic, sometimes dryly humorous and sometimes highly evocative, but never over-the-top.

In the first episode of Lost In Space (1965) the Narrator says, &#34;ELECTROMAGNETIC MIRACLES NOW COME INTO PLAY...&#34; He wasn't just talking about the Freezing Tubes. Irwin Allen had the guts to show Atomically Powered ElectroMagnetic Anti-Gravity Engines.<br /><br />When the Jupiter 2 lifts off in the 1965 TV Series, no one ever talks about this, but you can See it and Hear it, and I think that's not only impressive, but important. You can hear the Magnetic Engines in many episodes as the ship lifts off, or hovers, or crash lands. You can also hear the Magnetic Engines loud and clear one or two times when John and Don are working on them from a console outside the ship. The Time Tunnel has the exact same wonderful sound effect when it's charging to transport Tony and Doug. Anyway...<br /><br />In This MESS of a movie, the ship takes off with Rockets, and then Star Trek Nacelles pop out for Light Speed, exactly as they do on the Voyager ship!! I love Voyager, but they clearly ripped off this design from the Voyager ship as if no one would notice. Voyager began in 1995. This movie was made in 1998.<br /><br />If you Never saw the first season of Lost In Space (1965), this movie is not so great, but if you Have seen the first season of Lost In Space, this movie is HIDEOUS!!!<br /><br />In this movie, The Robot has the personality of a Toaster. Debbie the Bloop is a ridiculous, very badly animated cartoon character. A big part of what happens in the second half of this movie is so completely absurd that it cannot be enjoyed.<br /><br />ARGH!!! If you paid me $300 I MIGHT watch this movie again, but $300,000 would not make me enjoy it.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|This movie is so boring.  There is not much drama in this movie.  There is no philosophical value.  It is very different from the original.  I see this movie as an action flick but this movie has too much talking that makes no sense IMO.  I do like the visual. Visual is very good.  I also love the score.  I am going to get the sound track.    2 stars
B002BU0DPE|5.0|In short the headset works, and well! I've only had it for about a week now and I even got it used so I was even more surprised at how well it worked. The only problem I have is that I also play on xbox live and my set didn't come with one of the little adapters for the xbox controls. So if anyone knows where I might be able to find one please contact me at eru1@rocketmail.com.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I have liked almost every film Clint Eastwood has directed, but with this story, he made lots of choices that just did not work for me. First, a word about the successful parts: I sympathized with the main character played by Matt Damon, a reluctant psychic who would like to \\"retire\\" from the practice of giving readings but who keeps encountering people who need the hope that such contacts bring. I used to give readings myself. I was trained in my mid-20's in a small church of the American Spiritualist Association, in Albuquerque. I did mediumistic readings frequently for two years, never for money, and only part-time. Many people claimed that what came through me, but not supposedly from me, was helpful. However, I grew uneasy with the practice over time, and gave fewer and fewer until doing my final one in 1984, eleven years after first learning how. I met people who only wanted their pre-determined beliefs confirmed, and people who wanted \\"guidance\\" way too frequently, and people who \\"channel-shopped\\" until they got \\"spiritual permission\\" to do what they wished to do anyway. So Matt Damon's dilemma in this film resonated with me.    Ah, but Mr. Eastwood, you mucked up this tale of moral conflict mightily. The first two-thirds of your movie is so terribly slow, and sad, and much of it is in French, and I almost gave up on your film. Not everyone in grief is so paralyzed that he or she talks in whispers without need, or makes every physical motion take twice as long as it should. There was no real cause to make one character French and spend so much time in the details of her news anchor job. No real cause, either, to make another character British, and spend so much time showing his mom's drug abuse. All these atmospherics and opportunities to show the skylines of Paris and London do not add enough to your story line to justify the time you took doing them. I found neither the French woman nor the English boy sympathetic enough to make me root for them overmuch. The last 40 minutes were pretty good, but a film with such a title and theme should have expended more screen time showing and explaining the hereafter and less on the unpleasant details of the earthly lives of your characters.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I admit, I watched the movie before reading the book, which is not something I normally do, especially when it's Alan Moore. I enjoyed the movie immensely, and promptly had to buy it. Then I read the book, and discovered all the problems and inconsistencies of the film adaptation. Now I'm torn between them.  Either one is really enjoyable on their own, the book is a masterpiece, and the movie is really well done, considering it's by the \\"Matrix\\" brothers, which had me worried that it was going to be really dumb.   My advice is to read the book and watch the movie, but keep them separate in your mind, because that's the only way you can fully enjoy the movie.
B00448SE4S|1.0|I would leave a long discouraging review but this movie already waisted 2hrs of my life so I'll keep it short and say don't waist your time.
B0043EV774|5.0|The 3D visuals for this movie was amazing. It was better than any 3D movie I had seen in theaters. The story was edited and somewhat different from the original book, but still entertaining.
B000CEAGH6|5.0|i ordered two for my grandson and he adores this toy. he has made a youtube video using them. i would recommend this to any child or friend
B004FOA84A|5.0|The game is well designed, and I think worth the low price.  It is a bit short, but it kept me entertained, and well worth buying before you get on a flight so that you can be occupied for a few hours.  I like it, just temper your expectations.  At this price, I don't think you expect 40 hours of entertainment with REAL content (not something that is repeated over and over again).
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I do enjoy this recording, however, when I selected this item based on the grouping by Amazon and the design of the cover, I was expecting a recording with the cast of the concert at the O2, the same as the DVD with Alfie Boe.      This is not the case.  The cast though wonderful is not what I wanted to order.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Fox Network, it seems, has a history of being quick on the draw when it comes to pronouncing judgment on their offerings. Sometimes that is a good thing; Fox has canceled many a ludicrous and mind-numbingly inane series. However, sometimes they have canceled series with much promise.<br /><br />Never has Fox messed up so badly as when they canceled \\"Firefly\\". They took a cursory look at the ratings (98th in the Nielsen ratings, with about 4.7 million viewers per episode), and tossed this wonderful series in the trash can. They never even gave it much of a chance, having only aired 11 of the 14 of the finished episodes - and aired them out of order, with the pilot \\"Serenity\\" being aired later than other episodes. In short, Fox just seemed totally uninterested in supporting this series from the start.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of television anymore; as a matter of fact I canceled my cable service months ago because programming is just so bad these days. However, I do have Netflix, which allows me to stream quality shows I want to see. I had never even heard of the series, but after seeing gushing praise for Firefly on the Pharyngula blog, I dialed it up on Netflix. And oh, boy, did I ever get a treat.<br /><br />I've been a fan of written and visual science fiction for 4 decades, and as such have experienced it from many angles, both good and not-so-good. With Firefly, I saw sci-fi in a way I had never seen it before. I had of course heard of the term \\"space western\\", and have seen elements of that concept in shows like Star Trek and in movies like Star Wars and Avatar. However, until now I had never seen the \\"space western\\" theme realized in such a literal way. The juxtaposition between spaceships and horses, and space stations and frontier towns, is a delight to watch. The storylines are sometimes straight out of westerns, such as the train heist in \\"The Train Job\\". Josh Whedon, however, flawlessly interweaves the two seemingly at-odds thematic elements, and the result is 14 phenomenal episodes (and a great followup theatrical release, \\"Serenity\\"). There is an equal mix of drama, humor and action in this series, and just when you think you know what direction an episode is going to take, Whedon takes it in a totally different direction. Rarely is television so well-scripted, especially these days.<br /><br />Interesting concept aside, no television show is worth much if the characters are not believable or interesting. Firefly has great character development. All the main characters are (through both scripting and acting) fully fleshed-out human beings who we grow to deeply care about as we progress through the series. You can tell that the actors really cared about their roles, because their performances effortlessly exude the characters as they were conceived by Whedon. Through these portrayals come the series' great strength - a tale of desperate people of disparate backgrounds who find themselves linked in a particular place and time. We see the love and anger, the humor and sadness, and we identify with them. We want to be with them on Serenity, living the lives that they lead.<br /><br />All in all, I think that the Fox network executive who made the decision to dump this series should be hog-tied and deposited on the deck of a ship full of starving, amorous Reavers. Television is almost never this good, and if Firefly had been allowed to run its originally-planned 7 full seasons, I believe it would be referred to by the general TV-viewing public as one of the all-time great series.<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of sci-fi, get this anyway.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|One great presentation of a great piece of work in brilliant blu-ray by casts past and present.  It is very enjoyable worth the time and the money
B0042EJD8A|4.0|Other teachers at my high school use this video in their chemistry classes.  This was my first year teaching environmental science and the video fit in perfectly with our sections on energy.  The video was certainly meant to be one-sided, so it presents an excellent opportunity to discuss the environmentalist's side of the issue of natural gas drilling and hydro fracking.  We were also able to apply this to our region since we are in the middle of a lot of start-up wells.  Excellent opportunities to connect to a number of subject areas.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Well made game.  Quite short.  Abrupt ending.  Tricky but not impossible.  Worth a download.  Got for free, but would buy other games from developer.  worth $1.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Worked fairly well on my droid 2 global. Sometimes had to attempt to start mutliple times due to force close issues. Also if texts or calls came in, I was kicked out of the game, but your progress is automatically saved, so I guess it isn't bad just annoying.   I'm not a super gamer, so it took me longer than 30 minutes. However, it didn't take longer than an hour or so. It was fun, so I am hoping that they do continue the series.  I noticed that this developer usually works on games for a different platform, hoping that more of their games are made compatible for android phones/tablets.
1599218011|2.0|I'm pro-veganism and interested in the arguments behind a raw-food diet, so I'm amenable to books of this kind. (I read it on the recommendation of a health provider.) But, right from the title, I found the tone offensive. Karr is relentlessly cheerful in what comes off as a fake way, especially when considering that people with cancer will be reading this book. There's no room for difficult feelings: Everything is do, do, do, with lists upon lists of chores to be accomplished in pursuit of the diet, and the language is an onslaught of perky slang that feels forced and silly. (At one point, she calls cellulite a \\"scarier c\\" than cancer. And she can't say God or spirituality -- she has to say \\"God pod,\\" which -- what does that mean?) Even her meditation instructions are breathless and ungrounded. I couldn't read the book before bed, because its manic energy kept me awake.    And a word about the title: I know it's a brand, and I know she had to push for it because it comes across as \\"edgy,\\" but what is says to me is misogyny. \\"Crazy\\" is not, well, grounded or sane. And why should any woman set sexiness as a goal? Sexiness is a label put on women by other people (especially men). Sexuality, on the other hand, is what you own for yourself -- i.e., feelings of being sexual, enjoying sex, etc. Any woman who makes sexiness a goal is allowing herself to be defined by other people, and that's especially dangerous in a culture that defines sexiness in ways that are damaging to women.     In short, Karr wants to promote an alternative way of being, but she seems to have internalized damaging and misogynist values that remain unexamined. I wish she would dig deeper and find a place of real authority and wisdom -- as opposed to her girly, sex-and-cocktails, sitcommy voice, which I don't trust.
B004XKXH5I|5.0|So far, I have just finished Episode 1 of season 6 (plus all the extras so far)! It's fantastic! Nixon, Apollo Space program, and...  Well, I can't give everything away, but Amy does have a few secrets. But instead of telling you some of them, I'll quote River, \\"Spoilers.\\"  Four blue letters, 1 little child, an ex-FBI agent, aliens, and someone or something in a space suit! The possiblities are endless! Plus, we all get to know about River just a bit more, as the producers and writers have promised. This season of Doctor Who has the makings of being the best season yet!  Sadly, there will be no new appearances by Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, as she passed away earlier this April. I do hope we see an appearance of either Jack Harkness or the Doctor's daughter, Jenny, but no word on anything except that we'll discover River's secrets.  My only complaint is that I wish the episodes were longer. However, the first episode is a 2-parter... Can't wait until the next episode!  Hope you all enjoy the newest episodes and season of Doctor Who!
0375812024|5.0|This book is great. It's funny. My son watching this book for a long time and He even \\"reads\\" it himself. He laughs every time, looking at the pig, which is trying to catch his hat on each page.
B0041OOJNU|4.0|What I like about Shakira that is unlike any Latin American artist today is she refuses to be pigeonholed as the artist she was 15 years ago. I like that she explored the merengue and merengueton in this work yet she remains true to her uniqueness in balladry as well on Sale de sol, lo que mas, antes de la seis. I think she is a consummate artist and that is what longevity is about. Great music to listen and dance to.
B004XS97KO|5.0|Entertaining so far, but left wanting to know more. I guess we'll have to wait another week.  There is lots of clever interaction while they take time building the plot.  Clever humor, interesting story, great characters.  Props to the Doctor for not pressing his advantage as a timeless do-gooder.  A gentlemen amidst love, mystery, danger, and quantum entaglement.
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this app thinking I would get some version of an internet radio provider - I was wrong, this app allows me to listen to hundreds of stations from all over the world.<br />The search is very well done: you can look up radios by region, type, language, etc<br />The app is well designed works in the background like it's supposed to and has some nice goodies like recording, sleep mode and alarm.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001AP11L6|5.0|One of the best album i own, highly recommended it. excellent service got here on the first day of time frame.
B00422LESO|4.0|Just finished listening to the audiobook version of this.  It was really well read by whoever the actress was (didn't catch her name because it wasn't anyone I'd heard of, although she was fantastic).<br /><br />I feel like this book is or should be advertised as chick-lit, and it is JUST THAT - light-hearted, funny fiction for modern women.  I don't think this was meant to somehow fit into the category of Austen copycats.  I've read those and enjoyed some of them as a longtime Austen fan.  I really think this was not necessarily a book about Jane Austen, it was a book about Jane Hayes.  I think those that are upset because it's not \\"true\\" to Austen herself are missing the point - it's not MEANT to be an Austen tribute.  It's not really about Austen at all.  I adore all of Shannon Hale's books, and disagree that this is poorly written.  Chick-lit heroines routinely behave in erratic ways because they are usually searching for themselves, trying to grow up, trying to better themselves or trying to discover what they really want.  That is likely why many people feel this is also very juvenile-sounding.  Well, Shannon Hale is primarily a YA writer, so she may not have been able to help it.  But I found the writing to ring true to the feelings of a single or divorced woman of that early 30s age (as I am one of those and have a ton of friends who are as well).  We are successful in so many ways, yet many of us can't figure out why the guys we date are jerks, and our love life really seems to play out as a middle school melodrama.  Some of us are still young enough to be hopeful and possibly naive.  This is the character of Jane.  I think it worked well and had a satisfying chick-lit HEA ending (or a probable HEA).  Come on - did you really think you were going to be SURPRISED by the ending?
0812416317|4.0|very pleased with the service and a great book. i had to read it for english many years ago and I fell in love with the story.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was very good. Not too easy or hard. I'm looking for more like it already.  Good graphics. Smooth gameplay. Hoping the developer makes another
B000BTC5LW|2.0|Artistically this concert is great, but all I can say is that I hope someday it is released on Blu-Ray, properly upconverted to 16:9.  Do not miss the note on the back: \\"Concert footage restored, re-edited and presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio.\\"  Unfortunately what this really means is that it really doesn't look very good on a modern HD widescreen TV - the video is very grainy, and displays letterboxed as standard def.  I have a lot of other standard def concerts that look fine when played on an upconverting DVD player, but this one just is not one of them.
0385342055|2.0|I've been a fan of the Shopaholic series as they were light and amusing. It was fun to read about Rebecca fumble her way out of awkward, silly situations.  This time, I found it annoying and the storyline weak.  The book started with a focus on Minnie, Luke and Rebecca's daughter, who seems out-of-control and spoiled.  But by the end, (SPOILER), apparently she was just behaving like a \\"normal\\" child (hard to believe) and then the focus was on the extravagant birthday party for Luke (which was outrageously unrealistic).
B004FOA84A|5.0|I have to admit I only installed because it was free... however, I will seriously consider future apps from developer. The game is a good time-waster.. it is fun, but short.
B00000APLB|4.0|From the perspective of someone who is an amateur Stones fan, this is a good live album well worth having.  The audio quality is what really struck me - nice, nice sound.  And it's way better than Get Your Ya Ya's Out.
1607963183|1.0|I ordered this book at the suggestion of a friend. When it got here it sat around because I was really busy and when she came over she opened it up. She started laughing and showed me that while the out side was the correct book the text inside is actually \\"The Art of War.\\" I guess the first lesson is expect the unexpected.
B002ZG976U|5.0|BURLEQUE is a fun musical. Very entertaining. Cher and Christina Agulera did an outstanding job acting, dancing, and singing. BURLESQUE brought MOULIN ROUGE to mind, another great musical.<br /><br />Most of the movie takes place in a night club that Tess (Cher) is determined to save. Ali (Christina Agulera) is new to town and determined to make it on the stage of Burlesque. The story is light and fun with a touch of romance.<br /><br />Jack (Cam Gigandet), the bartender, comes home to find Ali, one of the waitresses, on his doorsteps. He offers to take her in. In time their growing friendship blossoms into an attraction that can't be denied.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Excellent price grandson was very happy.                              Thank You C.Payne
B002ZG98FU|4.0|MORNING GLORY is a cute, witty, and fun movie. Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) receives the big break she's been looking for when she lands a job as a producer of a TV show in New York City. The only problem is that she needs to find a way to increase the ratings or they'll all be out of a job, along with her reputation.<br /><br />In an attempt to save the show, she hunts down the infamous Mike Pomeroy for the position of co-anchor (Harrison Ford). Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) is not too keen on partnering with Mike, and sparks fly.<br /><br />Each character is well thought out and acted. Though romance is on the milder side, it does bloom between Becky and Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson) as she learns to trust him, and he teaches her that a life with all work and no play is no life at all.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Pretty annoying that they still managed to sneak an ad into the pause screen in the &quot;ad-free&quot; version. It may be for the Rio movie, but it's still an ad I don't want to see. Otherwise, the game is great.
0756655730|5.0|I buy lots of fossil books.  This time I didn't read the reviews.  So I wasn't expecting too much because of the low price.  But the overall quality is stunning.  I immediately bought four more copies so I can put them on library reserve for my evolution class, and to give as gifts.  I would have paid much more for this book.  The team that put this together should get some kind of prize.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|First, anyone who wants to see a real ballet movie should dig through their old VHS tapes and watch \\"The Turning Point\\" instead. I like Natalie Portman, but this was awful.  All of the dancing sequences are shown from the waist up..no legs, and that was a huge mistake. The dance scenes instead seem like you are watching through a porthole. The story line was weak, and while I am not a prude, I can't help but think if they'd spent the same amount of time developing the movie as they did on the 4 masturbation scenes and one lesbian sex scene it would have been a better movie.  I'd only recommend the movie for the closing scene of the black swan where she grows her wings onstage, that was done well.  Aside from that I'll be selling my copy.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|This is a great story. This remake is just as good as \\"Let the Right One In\\". Better hospital blaze scene and better pool scene.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|A nice addition to my Johnny Depp dvd collection. This is different from his recent movies and allows one to see Johnny Depp as well as his character.  He and Anjelina Jolie play well off each other and though there is a lot of action, it is not overdone and does not take away from the story.  Lovely setting, Venice and a well made film.  The rest of the cast are also very good in their portrayals.
B004FOA84A|4.0|i have trouble getting this started on my lg optimus S but when it does open and doesnt force close it's a really well done app i have found fun and challenging. nice artwork and scenery, and very exciting when i figure out one of the clues and puzzles. i got it as free amazon app of the day download but would be willing to pay $1-2 for it. rated it down one star cuz of the trouble getting it to run. usually rebooting my phn does the trick.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|I gave it  2 stars instead of 1 because I liked seeing the characters again. There is absolutely no bothering to sustain story or credibility. To wit: the most powerful mutant, a class 5, who can shred matter with her mind, and evaporate entire (large) lakes in fit of steamy passion is killed by a (Wolverine's) large salad fork. Disappointing. Expensive. Dumb.
030745455X|5.0|This novel is as good or better than the 1st in this series. I had the same problem with this book as I did with the 1st one. There are SO many characters that I had a hard time keeping them all straight. I had to backtrack several times to verify which character author was referring to. Perhaps the unfamiliar Swedish names add to my dilema here. Still a great read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was a really good book. I read the first two books and loved them. I was very excited to get started on this one. The book started out a little slow. but it eventually picked up the pace. I loved the middle of the book, though. It was the best part of the book.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!************SPOILER ALERT!!!**** SPOILER ALERT!!!**************SPOILER ALERT!!!********<br /><br />The end of the book was just Ok. It seemed like Katniss was fighting, got knocked out, and woke up with the capital overthrown. No action...except for Prim's death. Prim dying was really uncalled for. It was just plain sad. Also, Katniss shooting Pres. Coin istead of Snow was just wierd, but I'm glad Snow found a way to die anyway.<br />  Overall, I thought it was a very good book. It was a pretty good way to end the series. I know people who only read the first two books, or gave up in the middle of the third. DON'T! It is definitely worth it to read the series. I absolutely recommend this book.
0307454541|5.0|This is a great story. My only problem was keeping up with ALL the characters and their names. Even given that, the book had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This really is an insult to the people who made Lucas what he is today, boycotting this garbage is the only way my voice can be heard.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|occasionally has errors on start-up, but most powerful app for radio i have on my Droid2. Has stations the other apps are missing, and record feature is cool.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. It was cheaper to buy than to rent.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I waited a while for this and reread the first just prior to this one. I have to say it was just as entertaining. I had hoped for a few answers. I didn't get them. It still was massively entertaining. A lot of pressure on the next to tie up all these loose ends. I<br />I hope it isn't as long a wait.
6305320802|4.0|Though it was a used copy, it had no perceivable flaws. It was, however, missing the usual printed program notes.
B00028HBKC|5.0|this movie really touched my heart. it is the most amazing work i have ever watched! the message is the most important i think anyone could ever know. the realness of the film really made me feel what it was saying instead of just seeing or hearing it!! i love the lord and this made me more appreciative of the sacrifice he made for the human race. i strongly recomend it to everyone weather you believe or not.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Great movie.  I first saw it on the big screen and decided I had to have it when it was released.  So much music it's like watching a concert.  The sound on the Blu-Ray disk is great if you have the system to put it to the test.
0553582038|5.0|As engaging as all the other Ice and Fire books.  I hope with the popularity of the HBO series, Martin will stick to the 6/11 publication date for #5 and get back to his study to finish the series without taking as long as he has for #5.
B00004Y6Q5|1.0|Only a couple of tracks that are actually music.  Most of the Album is snippets of backround sound.  The short samples provided seem to hide this.  Do not recommend.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Lee Child once again manages to draw you in and encapsulate you in a story that while unique doesn't lose the unique character that is Reacher!!  Measuring safety against revenge, the story has soul!  The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is the price is way to high.  After I bought it on Kindle I found it used (and in great condition) online that was half the price INCLUDING the shipping.  It is hard to spend that much money on something I don't own=(
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is one of the most entertaining to come along in quite a while.    It's clever, creative and the characters very endearing.   We have never seen one show that we didn't laugh out loud.  The humor is smart, not slap in the face stupid.   If it doesn't make you laugh out loud or at least smile you probably hate Christmas, puppies and babies  and \\" grumpy cynic\\" is your middle name.     (You know the type)   For the rest of you  ENJOY!!
B004J1DBJI|2.0|I like Wolfram   Alpha and I find it very useful (and interesting!) What I don't understand is why I should pay $1.99 for an app when I can just go to the website and get the same info? Before we had browsers that could display all the conent this charge would have made sense. Now it seems way overpriced.<br /><br />Just go to the website and save your $1.99.
B004XS97QS|5.0|This was worth waiting for!  Season five was clearly made to familiarize us with the new Doctor, to show us that he is still the same despite the regeneration. This season starts with a bang, diving right into a surprisingly deep and complex first episode. Right from the beginning, it is intense and mysterious, but never lacking in the trademark wit and emotional stir.  If you've watched Doctor Who up to this point, it would be foolish to quit now!
B004UIOUHC|3.0|I like Opera, but like on PCs, there is really no reason to go with it when there are so many better browsers (like Firefox on PC and Dolphin HD on Android.) I love the opening page with the icons of favorites, but other than that there is nothing special about this browser. The tabbed browsing and flash is done better on Dolphin HD.<br /><br />It is an OK browser, but why settle for OK? Right now, Dolphin is the best. Get that one instead.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I love this charger, I inserted the battery and rested it on the charger.  Been doing this since I had it with off and on charging.  It also gives my mouse a home.  (Love to see one for the magic trackpad which eats batteries!)<br /><br />The only negative is that the battery pack is like the bottom plate with \\"batteries\\" attached, and it's sometimes a poor fit getting it on and off.  Once in a while it tries to pop off, so I think the design team should look closely at their manufacturing tolerances, especially with respect to the plastic clip which holds the cover on.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Grisly is an old school point and click adventure with high quality graphics and fun, challenging puzzles. Like all point and clicks it suffers from repetition and the sense that all you are doing is going back and forth, room to room to re-click things now that you have the key and so on. Grisly also suffers from small screens and big fingers when it comes to finding stuff. On many screens you can just push everywhere until things pop up. Not much different than moving your mouse around the monitor till your arrow turns to a hand.<br /><br />Overall, Grisly is a fun diversion and a neat trip back in time to old school games. It is easily one of the better looking and functioning games I've played so far. Fans of the genre should pick this one up. If you don't like point and click, don't mark the game down, just don't get it.<br /><br />Worth the cost.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Everyone who has an Android phone should have Angry Birds on it. Simple enough for my four year old and challenging enough for me, this is simply the best pick up and play game out there.<br /><br />The Free versions are ad supported, which causes a significant portion of the screen to be covered by ads. Some people complain about slow down from the ads, but on a Droid 2 I havent had any problems. The 99 cent versions remove the ads.<br /><br />Seasons is different as new holiday themed level come out periodically adding to the Angry Birds fun. When you go through an update, which happens frequently, your icon will change to the holiday theme that is new and you'll get new levels. (For instance, when it was Valentines you got a icon and levels filled with hearts; at St. Patricks, you got an Irish icon, etc.)
0140366997|4.0|Although I haven't read many Sherlock Holmes stories, I have enjoyed every single one.  This book was no exception, although I did find it to be riddled with many unanswered questions at the end of the story that I don't find to be normally present in other Sherlock Holmes stories.  Despite these, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense that this book offered, and I was honestly on the edge of my seat almost the entire way through.<br /><br />Story/Plot - Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by a doctor, who brings them a curious case.  His patient and friend Sir Charles Baskervilles has been found dead outside his manor, supposedly the victim of a heart attack.  The spooky part arrives when it is said that near his dead body are the footprints of a hound, which is the animal rumored to hunt down and kill all Baskervilles.  As Sir Charles's nephew comes to take possession of the manor, it is up to Holmes and Watson to keep him from the same fate.<br /><br />Writing Style - It couldn't be a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story and not be written fantastically.  The story flows almost perfectly, and the details are developed well.  The characters are portrayed very nicely, and they're are just the right amount of them: not so many that it's confusing, not so few that it's boring.  The perspective changes slightly a few times; you start with Watson's first person narrative, then move to his letter to Holmes, then move to his diary entry, then back to his narrative; it never gets confusing, though.<br />The major complaint that I have with the book is just that by the end there are a lot of questions unanswered.  To make it worse, the questions are usually pointed out in the story sometime and not just randomly minute details.  However, none of the detract from the novel enough to ruin the story, just enough to leave the reader wanting a few more answers.<br /><br />Warnings - Mild Horror, Violence<br /><br />Overall - Despite the unanswered questions at the end of the book, I have absolutely no other complaints about this spectacular story.  It's a little darker than Holmes stories usually are, I dare say, but it shouldn't scare older kids.  It truly is a classic novel that I would recommend all readers read at some point.book, I have absolutely no other complaints about this spectacular story.

B000F8O35U|5.0|what can i say the little mermaid is my favorite disney movie....i really dont like the other parts !!!     the bonus dvd is alright....its says games but there are not much on there....well they are not really entertaining !!!    otherwise my #1 disney movie of all times !!!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|The quality of the DVD is perfect, the casting leaves a bit to be desired.  Alfie Boe is marvelous but I was not thrilled with the rest of the cast.  I loved the 10th Anniversary recording so maybe my prejudice is showing.  Alun Armstrong just cannot be replaced as the inn keeper.  (Has anyone ever discovered why the inn keeper and wife are Cockney in a French play?) The inn keepers wife appeared to be the only repeat from 15 years ago and she is still the best.  That being said, if you love the music, you will enjoy this copy.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I watched the entire season on DVD and it was terrific. SGU is darker and more complicated than SG1 or Atlantis, which I also loved. The special effects are excellent and the ship has a very real feel to it. The stories capture the desperation of a group of people thrown together by accident and the conflicts that arise when they are stranded in deep space. The device of using the stones to switch consciousness from one person to another is a bit of a cheat, but still serves to make the stories interesting and to move the plot forward. Highly recommend this series, at least the first season.
B0000CABBW|5.0|When I first came to this movie, I thought it was going to be like Free Willy. Honestly, the poster showing a happy young girl with a whale, and the movie being called Whale Rider...I was expecting a bunch of hokey Free Willy type stuff. But boy was I wrong.    First off, the Maori culture is an amazing thing, it has always fascinated me and I wish I had seen this movie earlier to appreciate it at a younger age. But, as it is, I don't mind just now seeing it. Cliff Curtis was a welcome addition to the cast, but the rest were all unknowns to the typical Western viewer. Keisha Castle-Hughes was brilliant in this movie, providing a performance that rivals many Oscar-nominated young actors in Hollywood. I was blown away at the wisdom and emotion this young girl brought to the movie, and she held it together when I was ready to give it up in frustration to Rawiri Paratene's cruel grandfather role.    The overall theme of the movie is hard to follow if you are not familiar with how indigenous religions are; it might end up seeming silly to you that this much effort to carry on a legacy about a man coming from a distant land on the back of a whale and having a spiritual connection to the beasts, if you are not familiar.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|I watched a couple of episodes of Enterprise on television and was not impressed; probably because all programs are now so riddled w/ commercials that it's impossible to follow the plot. However, this series was highly recommended to me, so I purchased it. Star Trek is getting better and better. I'm old enough to have seen the original when it came out and remember how ground breaking it was. I loved Next Gen, liked Voyager even better and I think Enterprise may be the best yet. I haven't seen DS9 so can't comment on it. I wish the time travel plot had been extended and I wish the series ending had not been so dark, otherwise no complaints. I can't believe it only ran 4 seasons; there were so many stories that could have been told. It was extremely interesting to see how the writers linked the events in Enterprise w/ the those in the series that came before. I find it extremely frustrating that programs like Firefly, Farscape, Dollhouse and Enterprise are cut short when they obviously have a very large and loyal fan base. Are the powers that be paying any attention at all? I hope there is more Star Trek on the horizon.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|I started this Friday night and finished it Saturday afternoon. Haven't had much sleep. I loved the story, loved Enzo, but I will admit to blipping through a lot of the car racing stuff. Not a car racing fan, and didn't care about the details, which there are a lot of. I  just found myself paging through until Enzo started talking about something besides cars and racing them until the story line took a more humanistic turn again. Probably why it didn't take long to get through the book. Still, it was a heart wrenching story, and I cried and laughed more than once. Crying and laughing both in one book earn more stars from me. It was one of the better stories I've read in a while.
B000E1NWGO|3.0|Can you ever refer to Rubinstein as an amateur pianist? I have used his Chopin as a reference for the longest time to this day, but had never heard his rendition of these sonatas. I don't know where the root of his problematic execution on this CD comes from other than speculate that he didn't \\"feel\\" the pieces. Another reason, I dare venture, is that he didn't prepare and assimilate them properly. Some artists need to \\"mature\\" before they immerse themselves into, say, Bach. The best example is the third movement of the \\"Moonlight\\" sonata where is more notorious how the right and left hand seem to have been recorded at different times.

I HOPE the 2nd hand book store will take it, but I won't hold my breath. If Mary Higgins Clark can hit a home run every time, why can't Grisham?  Is this book more for men?
B004ISVH7U|5.0|The remastering and remix is fantastic. You are in the studio when the title track was recorded.

B001GQSY64|4.0|Ok, so I chose this disc over others because it had a digital copy with it, and I am a huge fan of digital copy with disney, so I thought this would be the same.  I put the disc in and wait for it to load so I could enter the code, boy was I surprised when it said this offer has expired. I go to warner bros support site to see whats up, and it states it was only for a limited time after initial release, and code is expired.  I sent them an email about it.  They should compete with their competitors or not all on these digital copies.  Their helpsite also stated that the expiration date of the digital copy is clearly stated on the exterior of the packaging!!  No ITS NOT.  only after you open it and on the inside only (at least on the one I bought).  Ridiculous.   Warners Bros if you didn't want to offer your customers a digital copy then don't put it in there!!    (fyi, as a user of paid for digital copies the quality is not very good, but when viewing on tiny ipods it is fine, which is the whole point of digital copies, to put on your digital portables)    My 6 yr old son however LOVES this movie (and he has never seen any of the regular star wars movies), so I did give it a good rating for that.  Not fare to give movie a bad rating b/c of warner bros.

0790729601|5.0|For the first time ever, The Terminator and The Son Of The Godfather (no, not THAT son) star together in an action-packed thriller that sizzles with spine-tingling suspense from hair-raising start to tram-smashing finish. Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Caan and Vanessa Williams give a power jolt to a terrific. The only scene I have a problem with is the gay bar scene. I personally don't think the scene was neccessary, and could/should have been changed to something less uncomfortable (the Third Book Of Moses, Called Leviticus 20:13 says that \\"Whosoever lieth with a man as with womankind hath committed an abomination, they shall surely be put to death\\"). Let me make myself clear: I think that that life-style is absolutely abominable and immoral. Though I admit, I like the song \\"It's Raining Men\\" that played during the scene. Rated R, but should have been PG-13.
B004FQKY5Q|4.0|When we last heard from Rozette with a new album, bands like Coldplay and Gorillaz were *just* starting to appear on the scene. Yes, we are talking Spring, 2001 (pre-9/11!), when Roxette released its most recent studio, the pleasant \\"Room Service\\". Now, after a 10 year hiatus (during which, it must be pointed out, umteenth Roxette compilation albums were released), we finally get a new (the 7th one, if I am counting correctly) studio album from the Swedish duo.<br /><br />\\"Charm School\\" (12 tracks; 41 min.) brings the same tried-and-true mix of uptempo irresistable singalongs on the one hand, and ballads (be they pensive or over-the-top soaring) on the other hand. And why not? Why mess with a formula for success that has served the band so well over its 25+ year career. So let me just point out some highlights on this collection: 1st single \\"She's Got Nothing On (But The Radio)\\" (which is my favorite song on here, and sounds like it could've been put on the \\"Joyride\\" album 20 years ago); opener \\"Way Out\\", another uptempo smash; \\"Big Black Cadillac\\", and the last 2 tracks, the pensive \\"Happy On the Outside\\" and \\"Sitting On Top of the World\\", which perfectly showcase Marie Fredriksson's voals.<br /><br />In all, there is nothing truly spectectular about this album, but there is nothing wrong with it either. It's pure  Roxette, nothing more, nothing less. I picked up this album when I was in London a few weeks ago. And of course you can buy it here on Amazon as an import. What Roxette has deserved to essentially be banned/blacklisted in the US on airwaves since their early days of success here, I do not know, and I think it's pretty outrageous, as I can think of a LOT of other bands that don't come even close to the level of Roxette, and yet those albums are released in the US, but not Roxette's. Roxette's complete absence in the US since those early days is also the reason that unfortunately I have never had a chance to see Roxette live in concert (they remain quite popular in Europe, South America and certain parts of Asia). All that aside, welcome back Roxette, we've missed ya! (And don't take another 10 years for another studio album, it's not like I'm getting any younger, you know!), South America and certain parts of Asia).

B0042U94UQ|5.0|My 4 year old loves this movie.  It is fun for kids and she laughs through the whole movie.  She had to keep showing me all the funny parts of the  movie.  This movie is a good choice for kids and parents would be able to sit through it as well.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Having a six-year-old means having to be really careful when making movie choices. When we saw the trailers for Rango, my husband and I realized that it was not for a six-year-old, and then Hop came along. It seemed like a kid-friendly movie, but none of us enjoyed it, not even my bunny-loving child. So, when I saw the trailer for Rio, I was predictably wary. The long Easter weekend convinced us to give it a try (for want of something better to do). I am so glad we watched this delightful movie - the vibrant colors, the exotic setting, and quirky set of characters make this an enjoyable family-friendly movie.<br /><br />Rio is the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a cerulean male macaw, who finds himself taken away from his native habitat and about to be sold at a pet store somewhere in Minnesota. Luckily for him, a young girl named Linda (the adult Linda is voiced by Leslie Mann) finds him and cares for him. The pair form a very close bond until an ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes along and convinces Linda that Blu, being the last male of his species, needs to mate with his female counterpart to keep his kind alive.<br /><br />Linda and Blu go off to Rio in Brazil where Carnival is in full swing, and amidst all of the celebrations, Blu finds himself falling for the lovely Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his female counterpart. Jewel is fiercely independent and resents being confined in a cage, and is determined to find freedom. Over the course of the movie, the pair find themselves being kidnapped by criminals specializing in the capture and sale of exotic birds, and facing down an evil nemesis in the form of an ugly white cockatoo named Nigel (Jemaine Clement). The rest of the story focuses on their escape attempts while Linda and Tulio try to find them.<br /><br />The movie is kid-friendly with one exception - the baddie in this show, i.e. Nigel is actually quite creepy and frightened my daughter who is usually not very sensitive about such things. Nigel's appearance is quite evil-looking and scary, and coupled with his effectively creepy voice, the effects are quite frightening for young children, so parents may want to take note of this.<br />Otherwise, the movie is pure fun - the songs are OK, not incredibly catchy or memorable, but the colors and setting more than make up for these flaws. The chemistry between the two macaws, Blu and Jewel drive the movie and make it an interesting watch for both adults and kids. Final verdict - highly watchable and fun family entertainment!evil-looking and scary, and coupled with his effectively creepy voice, the effects are quite frightening for young children, so parents may want to take note of this.

0143038419|1.0|I couldn't read the entire thing, I just skimmed it. The author was just too annoying and self-absorbed. It was as if she thought we, the reader, would be so enthralled with the inanities of her pampered life that she could afford to write basically a diary of her life.    And a boring diary too. Her \\"problems\\" really aren't that problematic. Her solution of traveling the world and taking a huge amount of time off work, to cavort with assorted men, etc., is not realistic for most of us.    Her decision to divorce is not explained well; it seems as if she just got sick of her spouse. Selfish, complaining and whining, self-absorbed to the point of narcissism, and supremely confident that the reader will sympathize with her and her mundane writing....I just cannot believe everyone loved this book so much!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic, it's the first book I read on my Kindle and it is amazing, so much so that as soon as I finished, I figured out how to use the menu feature of my Kindle and went back to the beginning to read it again.  So much detail that I didn't understand the first time through.  I'm a little sad that there's no sex.. yet... but I can wait.  Hopefully the next book comes out soon, because I am dying to find out what happens.    I won't lie, it does drag on in a few places, like at Sept-Tours and in Madison the story got a little slow.  I understand why, the characters and relationships needed to develop at a slower pace. Regardless, I really enjoyed it. It's the best book I've read in a while, definitely worth a read.

B004SBX112|5.0|please understand that Amazon is NOT responsible for the delay in getting the update out! it was rovio's mistake, they even admitted as such in their Twitter feed.   also, I'm getting pretty sick and tired of seeing these comments about the Amazon appstore having to be open for these games to work. anyone who has actually looked at their phones running processes knows that the stock marketplace is also constantly running in the background. this is to ensure that the app you paid for is only being run on your phone. otherwise you'd be able to download copies of your paid apps to other peoples phones. think about it for a minute!
0307712508|4.0|This is one of those books that is hard to review. The topic is so controversal even today. 60 years ago, a black sharecropping mother of five died of cancer. The doctors and scientists at the hospital took some cells from the tumors that killed her to study them. The cells made said doctors rich and they help cure alot of diseases. But her working class family can't even afford health insurance and Henrietta's untimely passing caused alot of hardship for all of them . Even worse, they often are harrased by reporters and other doctors that want to run all kinds of tests on them , to see if they have cells like Herietta. Mrs. Skloot  did a good job investigating this. She details how HIPPA has changed some things and not others,how hard it was to get the family to open up to her because the had been taken advantage of so many times. She explains very brainy things about cells and tissues in a easy plainspoken tone, so anyone could understand what she is talking about.  The two ladies narrarating , bahni turpin and cassandra campbell were spot on. They made listening to this a treat with their unique  voice variations.

B004MPEFBE|1.0|I started watching this and thought I missed a movie in the series. Not having read the books (although being a fan of the movie series), I found the story confusing and a little tedious. It was a disjointed and convoluted series of scenes mashed together without purpose or reason.    In my opinion the entire movie could have been condensed into a brief narrative at the beginning of the next movie (much like this movie started. Referring to events that didn't occur onscreen, but apparently caused major changes to secondary characters and relationships).
B004289ZW0|1.0|Like the other reviews say, it works really great except for one thing: The on/off function is a bit too clever and not at all reliable You will find yourself unable to turn the unit off and be left with the only way to shut it off is to let the charge run out. The manufacturer doesn't seem to think this is a problem. Hopefully another company will come out with this functionality but in a device that can be turned on and off.

B001HBYHFA|1.0|watching this movie in a theater was absolute torture. my friend hated it & walked out midway through. it was at the alamo drafthouse, so we still had to pay for food. i was angry at him so i just stayed and watched it all the way to the bitter end. even a couple of beers couldnt make this movie tolerable. I am a sci-fi geek, and generally love any halfway decent sci-fi flick. i figured that this would be right up my alley. instead this was the worst movie experience since pearl harbor. what is the deal with all the fans of this movie? i know some smart people who love this movie & the tv series. it is really beyond me. i just dont get it.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's 2011 psycho thriller Black Swan tells the story of dedicated ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) and her journey to achieve the role of the white swan as well as its dark alter ego, the black swan, in \\"Swan Lake\\". The tremendous amount of pressure put forth on Nina from her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), her sexually advancing instructor (Vincent Cassel), a jealous ballerina (Wynona Rider), and her fiercest competitor (Mila Kunis) results in Nina stumbling into a psychotic rage where nobody, even viewers, can differentiate between reality and hallucinations. The film asks its audience two questions that everyone faces at some point in their lives: how far will you go to achieve your goals, and at what point should you stop trying?   The Black Swan uses chaotic camera angles, fast paced action, intense sexual situations, and dark intimidating lighting to throw viewers into Nina's world where her thoughts are constantly gnawing at her sanity and she cannot tear herself from her alter ego, the swan. The film seeps into your thoughts and makes you question everything you're seeing.   The film's greatest restriction is its gruesome nature. From Nina self-mutilating herself to another ballerina puncturing her face with metal hospital tools, this movie is not for the faint hearted. Horrifying displays of self-harm and psychotic rage appear when least expected, causing me to jump in my seat more than once. Black Swan is so terrifying, because it delves into the deepest most horrific corners of the human mind that most people never even experience.   Aside from its dark nature, The Black Swan uses exceptional film techniques and beautiful visions to gracefully illustrate how fame and perseverance can mentally and physically destroy a person's life. For those who appreciate dancing and the arts, the film's beautiful depiction of the world of ballet will transfix and inspire you. Everyone in the cast captures the essence of their part meticulously making the audience feel as though they are experiencing all the jealousy, lust, frustration, rage, and accomplishment prominently displayed throughout the film. The film is stunningly portrayed making it memorable and thought provoking. The Black Swan is a perfect way for those who yearn to experience a serious film that they won't forget about the minute they leave the theater.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|The Foo Fighters are carrying the torch for Rock and Roll, and they have been for a while. I'm so happy that this is a strong album from start to finish. It will allow them to carry the torch for many more years. A weak album at this point may have done them in...there's only so many ways you can redo Everlong (although it is one of the greatest rock songs ever).    The Foos are doing a great job promoting this album. You can see every new song performed live in a dozen different settings already (see studio 606 on youtube), and they haven't even started touring yet. I think they have the right strategy and know that today's music industry is driven by the Internet and performing live. They'll have some huge festival shows this summer, and thanks to the Internet, many of the fans will know all the songs before the shows. Their fan base will reach epic levels this summer.     Favourite songs on this album are Rope, White Limo, Matter of Time, and Miss the Misery. Matter of Time is the hidden gem amongst all the songs.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is the first movie in many years that I have watched 3 time almost in a row.  I purchased it from Direct TV.  I watched it 3 1/2 times in 36 hours.  I had to leave the room a few times so I wanted to make sure I missed nothing and even after I was sure I saw it all I watched it again.  I had heard the story about the abdication of the older brother which was an amazing story but this is really a much more amazing story and I don't think much of the royal family.  So that is saying something.  The acting and the cast was one of those rare times when there is a kind of magic that occurs.  The old thing about \\"the whole is grater than the sum\\".  I was only sorry it was not longer.  I will probably buy the DVD even though I have seen it 3+ times.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Forced closed a lot. Good game but was solved too quick. Reset game but cant get in because it force closes and cant play. The idea of the game is great.  This was my first mystery game.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I love the Harry Potter movies and books, the special features add to the movies.  The DVD of the movie was great I enjoyed every minute of it.  I was very disappointed when I went to watch the new Harry Potter and The Daily Hallows special features.  I thought I had a bad disc.  How can I enjoy the next movie perview without a Blue Ray Player?  After reading the reviews I see I am not the only person disappointed with Warners Brothers new polices for release of new movies.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|Wow!! This guy is full of surprises. Thoroughly enjoyable. Not only has he written the soundtrack to many lives, he now brings us delectable versions of songs that are part of our nation's soundtrack interspersed with fantastic renderings of his own music.

B00012QM8G|5.0|In the beginning of the movie, Oscar Schindler exhibits the traits of a ruthless, deceitful, and inconsiderate individual as he attaches his NAZI pin to his multi-layered jacket.  However, as the movie proceeds, the kind-hearted nature of Oscar Schindler is divulged, along with his altruistic actions.  The movie \\"Schlindler's List\\" takes place in the German occupied territory of Poland during World War II.  During the early parts of the war, Oscar approaches a Jewish man named Izak Khan with a strategic business proposal.  His proposition, which was only implementable with Khan's financial support, was to establish an industrial enterprise.  This particular enterprise would manufacture the finest crockery for the German armies.  After Khan consents, Schindler demands a skilled and capable Jewish workforce.  At first, these were the only type of individuals that were permitted to work at the factory.  However, as more and more of the Jewish people came to him for salvation, he was forced to choose between saving money or saving people .  As stated earlier, this is where the kind-hearted nature of Oscar Schindler only enlarges.  From that moment on, he opened his doors up to more and more of the Jewish people, hence saving them from death.  At the end of the movie, the Jews commend him and his eyes are drowned in joyful tears.  This particular movie is an exemplification of why it is immoral to persecute a group of people because of their beliefs.  It shows the good nature/kind-heartedness of both sides and how their decisions are limited by a ruthless and dictatorial ruler (Hitler).  In reference to all religions, it shows all of us that the only way to obtain earthly liberation is by bonding together with love and using the interfaith dialogue.  For the Jewish people, the Holocaust is commemorated with a national holiday known as Yom Hashoah, which is held on the 27th of Nissan.  To them, it represents a substantial loss of their own kind and how they must strive toretain their own people/beliefs.  To others, the Holocaust represents an era that should only be revisited in memory.  Overall, it makes us aware of who WE are as people.  And most importantly, how we can all resolve conflict by collaborating,irrespective of religion or ethnicity.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app has completely changed how I interact with the word and allowed me to fill empty moments with God's truth! The reading plans are broad and excellent.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|First off, I loved the original series.  I like this better.  Heresy, right?    I would say the story is told more coherently, but that tends to happen when you shorten something.  I think the characters are more engaging and realistic in this one.    The animation is excellent, the japanese audio is fantastic, the english audio is very good.  In the english sound, they seem to have removed some of the sound effects, such as the eva's growls.  Its a shame, because they are done so well.    If you are new to the series, definitely check the rebuilds out.  If you are a die-hard fan of the original series,  still check these out.  I am as huge of a fan of the original series as anyone I have ever met, and I love this one.
1936594293|5.0|I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.<br /><br />I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.<br /><br />I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.<br /><br />At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.<br /><br />The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.<br /><br />But it did.<br /><br />I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.<br /><br />And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.<br /><br />I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that,I was in love with the book forever.<br /><br />Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivate<br />you and draw you in as it did me.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.<br /><br />Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?
B002OSXDAU|1.0|I did not purchase \\"The Fountainhead\\" because of the outrageous price charge by Amazon for the Kindle readers.  When I purchase my Kindle several years ago, I was told the New York Times best sellers would cost $9.99.  Since then, I have purchased over 80 Kindle books which I have enjoyed very much. Amazon currently advertises the this book in paperback for $9.99 and yet want the Kindle readers to pay $20.99.  It appears Penguin Publishing wants to do in the electronic book concept.  Since we still are in a free market, I choose not to buy the Fountainhead at that outrageous price or any other book published by Penguin.  Further, Amazon is without blame, they should not accept the publisher price of $20.99 but simply state the Fountainhead is not available in the Kindle format.  Kindle is about to screw up a great concept.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I read the book first and then went to see the movie. I think the book was better but the movie was real good. They changed a few things in the movie but was still one of the best I have seen in a while. I enjoyed the twist and turns of it all. I like not knowing till the end \\"who done it\\".I sure want to buy the Movie!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD covers a broad span of the Four Seasons' hits, including a couple I didn't remember. After all these years I have a new appreciation for the arrangements (horns, strings, keyboards) than I did when first hearing these songs on a small transistor radio or car radio.  A great value and great memories.

B00009NQQO|3.0|I'll have to agree with the reviews that warn about the suction cups.  Straight out of the box, one of the suction cups sticks just fine, but the other will release after about 10 minutes, with nothing in the net.<br /><br />I've tried wiping the suction cup, keeping it and the wall wet (or dry), and nothing seems to work.  This is a quality control issue with Alex Toys.<br /><br />Yes, the net is closed (the balls will not fall out of the bottom of the net), but as other reviewers note, you're welcome to cut a hole if you want the net to be like a normal basketball net.  Otherwise, leave it as is and give yourself somewhere to hold the balls.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I would like to add my displeasure at ridiculous price of this set. As a note, I have not read this series. I'm giving this one start review for the price of this kindle book set. I have ordered the paperback version of this set for $19. I prefer reading Kindle books, but when the publisher expects me to shell out a 200% premium I can't. I will buy the kindle version if the prices is reduced to where it make some sense! Publisher please listen to your customers!!!!!    I recommend more people show their displeasure at the high price!

B003CN5SAY|1.0|This is a review for the entire show and not just Season 6.    Seasons 1 and 2 of Nip/Tuck were brilliant. And I mean it. I think the writing was one of the best in television history: intelligent, engaging, thought provoking, edgy and just breathtaking. It set the standard for TV dramas and writing in all subsequent years if you ask me. The story lines were believable yet provocative and the topics picked were right at the heart of the matter. Because the characters were written with so much depth, layer and nuances, their struggles were believable and the audience could identify and often sympathize. For the first two years I really believed this to have been the best TV drama I had ever seen.     Unfortunately, it all went downhill starting Season 3. I dont know if they changed writers or just got blinded by their success and didnt try as hard, but Nip/Tuck made a downhill run starting in Season 3 until the abysmal failure which was the last season: increasingly improbable, far fetched situations that take the notion of suspending disbelief to new heights, bad to no character development (at least not one that is believable), unimaginative writing that is all over the place, everyone acting supremely out of character...I could go on with more examples. There just wasn't much depth in the characters later on and in fact at some point they became a parody of themselves it seems. The writers took the \\"sudden twists\\" in plot development that were gripping and enticing in the first two seasons and sprinkled them excessively in every episode to the point where it became almost ridiculous. While in the beginning they used those sparingly to get the desired effect, it was just overdone in later seasons - ultimately causing the show to lose exactly what it tried to accomplish.     As mentioned above, people behaving out of character was another prominent feature of the later seasons:     Yes, Christian Troy is a womanizer and playboy who loves luxury, hot girls and shinycars, but he is also a wounded soul, a caring man who deep down has demons to fight while at the same time trying to hold on to certain principles he would never relinquish. In later seasons, they just turned him into a vile, ruthless, unsympathetic, one dimensional animal who is lacking a moral center. While he had some endearing qualities in the beginning, he had none in the end. He was a weak, mean coward who lost his edge and humanity.     Sean, who was always the thoughtful, loyal, dedicated and responsible person and especially father, was turned into a big time jerk and sex maniac in the later seasons - a man who had no interest in his family and his children and who slept around and used people.     The same is true with most of the characters really. Julia, (Joely Richardson), was a driving force in this series. Her struggles of wanting to go to med school and being more than just a house wife, as well as her subdued, unspoken love and attraction for Christian were an important relationship and plot element. Gradually, she made fewer and fewer appearances, however, became a lesbian at some point (yeah right) - stating she had always been one - and then she sort of disappeared for extended periods of time without explanation or closure. Her passion for medical school and her own life were never even touched upon again and she herself disappeared into obscurity. That was sad, because Julia's presence and the tensions that had developed between her, Christian and Sean were at the heart of the show and its drama. They spent two years building all that up just to drop the subject altogether and never revisit it again.     Speaking of unresolved: Gina just completely disappeared at some point without explanation and then came back just to die in the most absurd, ridiculous way you can imagine: she fell during sex out of the balcony. I really thought they were kidding and this was just someone's day dream or imagination but lo and behold, that was it: she really fell off the balcony during sex. Not only was that ridiculous but also sad in a way and just insulting to what the writers had done with the character in the first place. I always found Gina very fascinating and tragic; the self destruction, low self esteem, the fact that she was Wilbur's mother and her battle with HIV. Her character was filled with potential and they just let her fizzle out and then die in this embarrassing, trashy manner. Totally insulting. I wonder what Christian will tell Wilbur when he asks about his mother one day.     There is also Kimber, another deeply tragic character who ended up being very underutilized given the potential the writers had with her. They did an amazing job exposing her self destructive tendencies and low self esteem, but then just like that, they dropped her and she too became a two-dimensional paper doll and a cliché. Christian marries her on and off over the seasons, but nothing in their dynamic with each other changes. She doesnt develop as a character for either the better or the worst. I saw a glimpse of hope when she got that abortion and it turned out she could never have kids again - gosh that entire plot segment was filled with potential for her character and the implications of that for Christian - but instead of keeping going on that strong note, they just dropped it and let it fade away. The same thing happened when she died. Did she commit suicide? Is she dead? Is she alive? What exactly happened? We never find out. Her death was not remarkable to anyone - which it should have and could have been had the writers not been so busy making up far fetched bogus stories.     There is also that entire plot of Christian marrying Liz. Speak of behaving out of character: Liz always held herself and others to the highest standards. She had a disdain for Chrstian's superficiality and how he used and treated women and she was fully aware of it too. She would *never* have stooped to his level and married him. That was justnot her. But they put it in the script and made her whine after Christian and it was ridiculous.     If these were changes in plot and character the writers intended, they should have gone about it in a different way (even though there is no excuse for some of the outlandish plot twists they introduced). People dont just change overnight and fiction or not, you still have to adhere to certain rules such as character consistency within a plot. Sean was portrayed from the beginning on as a hard working, ethical, dedicated father. It is completely out of character for him to suddenly turn into a vile jerk who uses women and doesnt care about his kids. Liz would never have fallen for Christian's sweet talk and married him and then pine away after him, that is ridiculous - not to mention that she is a lesbian.     Of course it is possible for people to change but there has to be evidence for it in the story and plot and not simply because the script says so. The later seasons are drizzled with even more such inconsistencies, which is a sign of bad writing more than one of just things having changed due to the circumstances the characters find themselves . Acting out of character is not character development.     Finally, changing the setting from Miami to L.A. aided in ruining the show completely. The L.A. setting made them be nothing but a bunch of cheap, trashy, run of the mill Beverly Hills plastic surgeons trying to find a way to sell out to the media by humiliating themselves - sort of like the Kardassians. There is some kind of a mystery, sexiness and just boldness to Miami which L.A.'s theme-park commercialism lacks. In the show, L.A. was portrayed as a den for greedy TV producers and dumb people with non-existent moral codes willing to do anything for a dollar, a d-- ck and a dream. McNamara and Troy just became pawns in that scheme and the stories shifted from them to Los Angeles, the dirt of that town and the despicable people roaming it (to the point of stereotyping the city). That was a bad move which, in my opinion, pretty much sealed Nip/Tuck's ruin and reduced its quality to just any other forgettable TV show you hope to end.     The bottom line is that after the success of the first two seasons, the show's producers and writers put the characters into increasingly more improbable situations to the point of turning them into clichés of themselves and the show as such; coupled with the issues mentioned above - such as character inconsistency and poor, chaotic plot development - the result has been that over time a serious disconnect has been created and once you have too many of those disconnects, you lose credibility. And I think that is the main breaking point in the end: the show lost a lot of credibility, unintentionally became a farce of itself and with that it lost the edge and brilliance that made it so amazing and intense in the first place.

0670022411|4.0|I guess I'd call this book an occult mystery for the intelligentsia.  It was a little slow at the beginning, maybe because the main character came into the story fully developed in the authors mind,  but not the readers.  After I adapted to the style, though, the book kept me in thrall until I finished it.  The author definitely knows European history very well - not a surprise given her background.  But the novel seemed to fluctuate between serious/scholarly and whimsical.  I couldn't decide whether the author was writing an intelligent \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults, or a fantasy novel for those who eschew romance novels, but do like a little swashbuckle.  That said, I did like the book and look forward to  the next in the series, to be published apparently in 2012.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|There's so much to say about this book I don't even know where to start.  It was fantastic, one of the best books I've read in quite some time.    The characters were well-developed, the writing style would hook you into one storyline and then switch to another, always drawing you just a little further each time.    Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy, you won't regret it.

031261246X|5.0|I'm an avid reader of fiction works, with a minor penchant towards the techno-thriller. This book was even better than I was expecting. The technical accuracy mixed with a sense of \\"this really could happen\\" was the perfect mix of story telling. It was a very entertaining read for me, cover-to-cover in one afternoon/evening. Would highly recommend to anyone, even those without technical aptitude. Most of the concepts are broken down into easy-to-understand descriptions for the layman.

B003G4IXBK|1.0|To put it mildly: This is a real dissapointment! Why? Because of the terrible quality of the vinyl. I mean: How COULD you do this to such a classic prog jewel? And the cover just underlines it with it's simple, punky reproduction (which at least would've been ok if the vinyl/sound was good).     Conclusion: This is like:   1) beeing cut with knives in the ears, and    2) then have salt added to the mess.   3) Such things hurt.    P.S. Good thing I stumbled across the original vinyl on ebay (mint vinyl, mint textured cover, WWA 002 super de luxe). Yes it was expensive, but hell, was it worth it! Sounds like seventh heaven; even my hands smile when they play with the cover... Lucky me!     They sure don't make them like they used to...
0307595862|5.0|It's hard to review a mystery or detective novel without giving too much away. If it's a good one, you wanna grasp by the shoulder everyone you know and say, \\"This was SO good! Let me tell you....\\"  If the friend is also a book reader chances are they will say, \\"Stop! I haven't read that one yet!\\" and you're forced to keep mum while you relive the plot as it swirls inside your noggin.<br /><br />At first I didn't like this book. About a month ago I finished my first Scandinavian thriller/mystery, Faceless Killers by Henning Mankell. When I began Jo Nesbø's Snowman too many things stood out to me as rehash of the first Kurt Wallander. Both make ample use of the down-on-his-luck police inspector who's harsh personal life is just as prone to tragedy as his police work. Both authors also use the icy climates of their region to great effect, to the point that the weather is as much as a character as any person. Until the halfway point at least I let my reading of a previous thriller set in this locale hinder and even cloud my enjoyment of Nesbø's novel. After I dropped the comparison and began to enjoy the book for what it is, I found that while the novels are similar in terms of 'feel', each author truly has his own unique spin on the world around him.<br /><br />With Stieg Larsson's Millennium-trilogy (which I'm waiting to read until I have a few more examples under my belt with which to contrast/compare) the publishing world has gone nutso for all things Scandinavian. For the last ten years or more I've enjoyed the music scenes of Norway and Sweden and with the easy availability of these novels I hope to read as many as possible so that I might get a verbal tour of each country's major towns and culture. A well rounded experience to go along with the music.<br /><br />The Snowman is Nesbø's seventh novel in the Harry Hole series and the first that I have read. The first two have not yet made their way to English translations. I was hesitant to begin so late in the series but when I saw this book in the Vine newsletter last month I couldn't resist. In Snowman Inspector Harry Hole is on the trail of a supposed serial killer who may or may not have ties to a series of killings twelve years previous. I don't have any previous knowledge of the series with which to compare, but Nesbø did a good job of filling in a reader new to the series by helpful character tags and characters reminiscing about previous cases and other characters now gone. In several of these reminiscences I was forced (obligingly) to add previous novels to my To Be Read pile because I thought, Now that sounds like a good story!<br /><br />Going back to my introduction, it's hard to comment on all the twists and turns in this novel without feeling like you may ruin the experience for another reader. In short, I will say that the twists and turns almost wore me out (my brain felt like a corkscrew!) but there was not a time that I didn't find myself wanting to read the novel. For the last year or so I've been reading two novels at once, sometimes because it helps me through a boring novel that I may put down otherwise but when read in conjunction made the boring novel seem like a nice bit of fluff between a more \\"heady\\" read. With Snowman, I read this book and ONLY this book until I was finished. Even early on when I was less than certain about how much I would enjoy this compared to my previous experience with Kurt Wallander (who I loved and can't wait to read more about), I still took every opportunity to snatch up the book and read a chapter. I think this is the kind of book that the phrase \\"compulsively readable\\" was invented to describe.<br /><br />This mystery, if you don't much care for it at the onset, will grow on you. I can only imagine that it will fester if you enjoyed it from the start. There is a strong sense of foreboding throughout and the use of \\"mold\\" as a metaphor is both humorous and all too fitting. This was my first read as part of Amazon Vine and I can't think of a better book with which to feel inaugurated into the program.with which to feel inaugurated into the program.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I did not buy the cannon bag so I can not compare if it was really worth saving the money.  However I can confirm that the bag is worth the price you pay and possibly more.  The padding if fabulous, but the zippers are a not very smooth.  There is room for  a13 inch macbook in the front pocket, however it is very snug around the corners and you could not fit any bigger computer in there.      Overall I am very satisfied with the bag!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am by no means a wacky born-again Christian or anything like that; I know I sin: I swear, make fun of people sometimes, get angry, drink too much, eat like a glutton, lie, etc. Honestly, I used to idolize my favorite football team more than I did Jesus. This movie helped trigger a conversation that helped re-inforce my belief in Jesus Christ as our savior. It helped to make me realize that I can admit I am a sinner and that I need to be saved by Jesus to enter into heaven someday. I think this movie helped put emotion behind the story of Jesus. Hopefully it helps others believe more strongly in Jesus. Watch it and see. You never know how it might make you feel. Even if there's only a slight chance that Jesus really did go through this torture for us, it would help to try to believe, just in case! Hell for eternity would be awful. I want to go to heaven. It is also pretty graphic and edge of your seat.

The songs on \\"21\\" feel more polished, but the songs on \\"19\\" are not rough or sloppy or anything--I think Adele just found even more focus for the songs on \\"21\\". That being said, the range and variety of songs on \\"19\\" is wide and shows what an amazing vocalist and creative spirit she is.

Futhermore, the actors and writing staff manage to do so while still maintaining the human element that makes the viewer actually care: the devotion Sam and Dean feel for each other and the terrible burdens they are continuously forced to bear. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have always deserved more recognition for their work and the show has always deserved a wider audience.  In an age where far too much television no longer involves scripts, acting or writing talent, this show still brings it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I bought this carry case for my Plantronics Voyager Pro.  It nicely holds the unit and protects it from getting twisted (and broken) in my pocket or briefcase.  It is branded Plantronics and is a perfect fit.  You can charge it when it is in the case as well.  Magnetic closure.    I ended up buying another one for my wife's Voyager Pro.    Recommended to anyone that wants to protect the earphone when not in use.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I highly recommend these. Great sound quality. Occasionally, there is a moment of static, but only for a second. That's about the only thing i have a problem with. Other than that, these are a must buy for anyone looking for a surround sound solution, that won't keep the rest of the household awake late at night.

B0000DD79B|2.0|Look at all this live crap.  Why would they do this?  I agree with some of the other reviews that state that \\"The Best of Simon and Garfunkel\\" is by far, a better collection. It may not have \\"Keep The Customer Satisfied\\" and \\"Baby Driver\\" but, if you were a true Simon and Garfunkel fan, you would have the \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" CD, anyway.  And to me, those are the only two great tracks missing from their single CD of \\"The Best of Simon and Garfunkel\\"<br /><br />I have their box set anyway, but \\"The Best of Simon and Garfunkel\\" is a great CD to have in your carousel CD player to shuffle with other 60's folk artists.<br /><br />To have \\"The Best of Simon and Garfunkel\\" and Paul Simon's \\"Greatest Hits, etc.\\" on CD is a very tight collection of the absolute best of Simon and Garfunkel.  Art Garfunkel's \\"All I Know\\" is easy to get as a cheap MP3.
B004DMIIO6|4.0|The movie seems to have the mask of being a \\"robin hood\\" themed movie but I found it to be such a small part of the movie to not even talk about it. Let's say maybe 5 minutes worth of the movie. Essentially Goemon goes by the \\"Greatest thief to live\\" but he started out as a ninja serving his master that saved him as a small child and taught him how to become strong so that nothing could be taken from him. His master/mentor then was assasinated in which Goemon then took on his \\"freedom\\" and went into stealing for a living.<br /><br />Then his past comes back to haunt him and you begin to see how all of the main characters have such a deep history together and everything you thought was wrong.<br /><br />In  the end I would say this was a pretty good movie. It has some great fighting scenes but I will warn you that this is not a realistic action movie. It has unbeleiveable jumping and swordplay that go well with ninja movies.<br /><br />Not sure if I will watch this movie again though. I would recommend a rent
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original, and didn't think anything could touch it. I was wrong. By far the absolute best anime i've ever seen. Highly recommend this new series for old and new fans alike
B00000FCBC|4.0|So this 27 track double CD contains cover songs disc 1 is a hit and miss affair but I do like their versions of Thin Lizzy's Whiskey in a jar and Bob Seger's Turn the page and Danzig's Die Die, my darling and maybe a few others but they escape me for now.  I'm sure like most I got this for disc 2 which features 1987's the $5.98 EP Garage Days Re-revisted (later changed to The $9.98 CD Garage Days Re-revisted for the US release) which had been OOP for several years as well as b sides from various singles (88-95?) I'll admit I was miffed when this was announced as a Metallica fan I had collected the singles with the b sides and what not however the sound has been remastered or at the very least sounds superior to when they were originally issued by the band.  If you can not afford an original issue of Garage Days or don't feel like tracking down the various singles the b-sides were collected from then this is the next best thing and cheaper.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|The Walking Dead season one is not a bad purchase, but it is a bit lacking in the extras department.  There are no deleted scenes, no sneak peaks, and the extras that are present can be found for free on the internet.  All the things you would expect to be on a DVD release aren't really there, and it hurts the value of this product.  That said, The Walking Dead is an excellent show, and I do not regret purchasing the DVD set.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|So when I started reading the instructions, I was very worried at how difficult this was going to be to install.  They don't give you the best instructions to begin with, but when it starts by telling you to moisten your fingers with the spray I start to get worried...  The good news is, once you figure out where all the tiny pieces go it's extremely simple to put on.  I did have to cut one of the small pieces down due to the way Verizon modified the button layout (very slight), but other than that it is a perfect fit.    Overall, I have no doubt this will protect my phone.
159420229X|5.0|The book narrates the story of a journalist exploring the various area of memory research and competition, to becoming a competitor, and both parts are really fascinating. The various people that Joshua meets and interviews through the story, including memory champions and competitors, memory self-help gurus, and those who have physical conditions that have drastic effects on the their memories. There are some really interesting perspectives that are drawn out from the different people Joshua speaks with and really question the framework and understanding of the human mind.<br /><br />Equally interesting, is the story of Joshua training for the championships himself. Though not outlined in great detail, being introduced to various memory techniques used by these competitors is very interesting and outlines the power and complexity of the human mind. It is also engaging to be along for the ride as Joshua becomes more of a part of the memory circuit community. A lot of the players are really interesting people and make for a really entertaining story.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great book that introduces the history and ideas behind memory training and the study of memory without reading like a textbook or a self-help book. The narrative is interesting and engaging and really takes the reader on a fun ride.
B004WKI204|5.0|As a Tina Fey fan, I found this an absolute delight.  She is honest, and funny with delightfully chosen snippets of her life. The book is short, in a good way, and not preachy or self-righteous in the way some memoirs become.  This is truly the funniest memoir in years.  Worth the hardcover price, I am currently lending it to nearly everyone I know.
B004M3H17Q|3.0|Really I would give this two and a half stars. Since that is not an option, I'll just round up.<br /><br />I found James Blake through an Amazon recommendation by way of Bon Iver. After listening to a couple samples and reading some reviews, I clicked that 1-Click Buy perhaps a little too soon. I wanted to like this album. I even convinced myself that I did. That changed when I actually sat down and listened to it.<br /><br />James Blake, son of English guitarist and vocalist James Litherland, was announced in 2nd place for the BBC's Sound of 2011. Shortly thereafter, he released this first full album in the self-titled James Blake. Being the son of an established professional musician, he grew up playing the piano and eventually attended Goldsmith's University to study music. A few months before attending the university, he received a taste of dubstep and pursued producing music in that genre.<br /><br />The album did have its merits. In addition to some interesting electronic melodies, James Blake has a decent voice, and, at times, this album showcased that. \\"The Wilhelm Scream\\" was the highlight of the album for me. I was a bit disappointed when I found out the song was not his own, but rather his father's. However, it served as a nice modern rendition adding some beat and electronic elements. His cover of Feist's \\"Limit To Your Love\\" was a actually a good idea. While Feist has a great voice, James Blake's voice gave the song a little more gravity. Like many songs on this album, this song became trite and predictable. I appreciate what he did, but I would have loved this song had he kept a straight blues-y Bill Withers sound he introduces the song with. I know James Blake's music is in part defined by auto-tuning, but he really could have staved off it here.<br /><br />Much of this album felt like an idea that didn't quite manifest itself. Many of the songs begin with an interesting mix of concrete melodies with electronica, but degrade to a default and ungenuine auto-tune-clicks-and-whistles midi-mashup. Some songs, like \\"Lindisfarne I\\" and \\"Lindisfarne II\\", could have had a bit more melodic structure from the beginning to give them more purpose and direction. Other songs made me think that he just ran out of steam. I would have really liked it if he had expanded more on \\"Why Don't You Call Me?\\".<br /><br />After listening to this album, I immediately pictured an anxious kid in his room recording this hoping for acknowledgement for being hip and edgy. I found myself yelling at my speakers: \\"I get it! You don't have to convince me that you are cool anymore.\\" In his self-titled album, James Blake exhibits flashes of his deep musicality that goes beyond the world of electronica and some interesting musical concepts, however, I feel like he often gets stuck on this and just runs his songs into the ground.<br /><br />More than anything, I agree with Lone Wolf: Please stop labeling this \\"like Bon Iver\\". I know James Blake claims that they are an influence, but the genres they exist in aren't even really compatible. Moreover, Bon Iver imbues their music with a raw soulfulness and passion that I'm not even sure electronica music can convey. They just don't compare.midi-mashup.

0670022411|5.0|This book was fabulous! It took me about 80 pages for it to hook me, then I couldn't put it down! I understand her second in this trilogy won't be out until 2012....no fair!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Haven't read them all, but can hardly believe the volume of critical reviews here.  CR is clearly the top Bond movie in decades and, in my opinion, among the best in the entire franchise.  Royale is well-written, casted, paced and acted.  Additionally, the main story and the 'How'd Bond become Bond?' back story are both compelling.  Watch it for yourself; don't be disuaded by the nay-sayers.  I think you'll be glad that you did.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Ok, I just got this and it's awesome.  Not only do you get engrossed in all the plotting, scheming and excitement, but the goodness . . .the men are TOTAL eye candy. I read the other reviews and yes, it's a mixture of 300 (which I love), and Caligula.  I'm wondering if the second season is as good?
0156027321|1.0|This was definitely NOT a page turner.  I tried for 100 pages to get into it.  Grant it, if a book takes too long for it to grab me, I'm done.  However, this book just was sooooo boring.  The author tries to describe everything in EVERY detail.  How many words can you use to describe a blue sky???  Just describe it and move on already.  I usually try to finish a book, but I just could not get through it.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|This show is one of my all time favorites for so many reasons. The situations the crew get placed in aren't too novel for the most part, as many are spin-offs of old-school western motifs, but the combining of futuristic technology with rustic badassery makes it seem new and novel. What really makes the show though, is the writing and the characters. Captain Reynolds(Nathan Fillion) is to me, the single greatest television characters ever and the chemistry between him and the rest of the crew is great. The show maneuvers  between serious and comedic seamlessly and for a show that is not billed as a pure comedy, has some of the wittiest banter you'll find anywhere. The only downside to this television show is that when it is over, it leaves you with a feeling of sadness, as you realize all the loose plot threads that were left unanswered, will more than likely never BE answered, and you begin to think of what could have been had it not been for Fox's massacring of this amazing show.     GO browncoats!

B004FOA84A|4.0|So the game play is fun and amazing, but my issue is the fact that you only need to solve about 5 'puzzles' to finish the entire game... For $1 it's a pretty decent investment for those looking for a way to kill 30 to 60 minutes - or more if you want to drag it out. The problem I had was I found out the solution in 2 nights of playing for about 10 minutes total. Great play, good price, would also love to see a sequel - or maybe a longer version of the same?
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The Kings Speech\\" follows the ascension of Prince Albert Windsor (Colin Firth) to King George VI and his simultaneous struggles with stuttering and how he overcame this problem through the help of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush).<br /><br />Bertie, as he was known by his family and Logue addresses him as such through most of the movie shouldn't have been king, and wasn't expected to be king because of he was third in the line of succession after his father, George V (Michael Gambon). After his father's death his brother David (Guy Pearce) became King Edward VIII and then abdicated because he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best).<br /><br />If anyone believes the royal family has an easy life, the story of Bertie's childhood will put that to rest. As Logue explores the cause of Bertie's stutter some revelations come to light. Raised primarily by nannies, Bertie had limited contact with his parents as a child and that was at arranged \\"visitations.\\" We learn that Bertie's first nanny didn't like him so she would pinch him so he would cry at the visitations and his parents would quickly return him to the nanny's care and she wouldn't feed him. His father was also domineering and because of David's hedonistic lifestyle expected a lot more from Bertie, and having to address your father, literally as \\"your royal highness\\" is a good way to intimidate a child. Bertie's major strength in life was his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), not only supportive of Bertie but was the one who finds Logue to help.<br /><br />I don't think I`ve revealed too much of the plot. Hopefully enough to whet your appetite. The strength of the movie lies not in the plot, but in the acting and that's what holds the movie together, the strength of the performances. \\"The King's Speech\\" also defies expectations on certain counts, such as a scene that could have been safely a clich&eacute; where you think it will be demonstrated to Bertie that he can speak without stuttering defies the clich&eacute; and Bertie discovers on his own that through Logue's help he can speak without stuttering. You could attribute that to just following the chronology of history, but throughout the movie scenes that you think you know how they will play out, defy those expectations and give you a much more interesting movie. There's a little something for everyone, a little comedy, mostly related to smoking as a healthy activity, and what do you call a royal when they drop in on your house. Drama as Bertie struggles with his problem and struggles with Logue, and the mounting expectations put on him as it becomes clear that Edward will have to abdicate.<br /><br />The Queen Mother, Elizabeth (the mother of the present Queen Elizabeth), didn't want the movie made of this until after her death, it makes one wonder why? She is presented as nothing but supportive of Bertie. The worst it presents her husband as a an unwilling king, but they all seemed to be unwilling to assume the mantle of the crown. Otherwise Bertie is shown more as victim of low self-esteem. Was she worried the royal family would be perceived as human?<br /><br />Special features include a directors commentary, a making of documentary, and an interview with Lionel Lougue's grandson.ché and Bertie discovers on his own that through Logue's help he can speak without stuttering.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|(very slight but not very spoily spoilers ahead)    For everyone reading the one-star reviews and wondering if this is a book they want to purchase, please give it a chance.  It's really amazing, and the narration is captivating.  I won't drone on in defense of this novel.  I would LIKE to.  But I'll say this: Have some imagination.  Get down on your hands and knees.  Forget about what you know about the world.  See things not from your 43-year-old businessman suit-and-tie world, but from that of a five-year-old's point of view.  When you hear Jack tell you about Room and Ma, pretend you don't know ANYTHING.  Stop being an adult, stop having opinions, stop thinking about your own Room, which is sure to be bigger and wider than Jack's.  Just listen.  Don't assume anything.  Don't read this and feel smart knowing that you know more about the world than Jack and therefore he's not a believable character.  If all you had was what Jack had, would you be \\"normal\\"?  If you went through the same dramatic situations, wouldn't your personality be inconsistent?  To me, it's all perfectly fitting for a five-year-old, and even more understandable given the abrupt changes to his reality.      Consider his singular situation before you come to the conclusion that he shouldn't talk as he does, or act as he does.  Don't apply YOUR childhood to Jack's.  If you do, you will ruin this remarkable story.

We ordered the movie on Amazon and my kids have watched it a few times.  I just recently ordered the sound track on Amazon too, as they want the songs now downloaded on their Ipods.  This is a movie that was popular in the 80's but you don't often see it re-played on Cable.  My family and I are enjoying watching it again on DVD.
032147404X|4.0|I really like the way the author shows photography. Takes the didactic element away and focuses on you shooting with him as buds. If you are not turned off by bad humor that the author has, then you will enjoy this book. Like a friend with bad humor I just didnt read his bad attempts at humoring his reader.    I did feel like the book could have more content, the author tends to have a lot of fluff that doesnt help at all. There is even a space utilized for getting wrinkles out of your clothes, the author acknowledges that he put it in there because he had nothing to fill the page space with (really??).    I think I paid like 15 bucks for it through amazon, which is the most I would have anyone pay given the little content it offers.    But overall for the price I paid, I got what I wanted and would be interested in more books from the author.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|This was one of the first horror movies I ever saw and is still one of the best ever.  Bela Lugosi is the perfect Dracula.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Music with meaning is becoming rare these days. Now you don't even need to have a good voice anymore to become a singer. So to find a individual or a group with genuine musical talent that is main stream is almost impossible. Mumford And Sons is one of those groups. They've not only revived the english folk scene in England, but they have made it become extremely popular in the United States. They've even made the banjo cool! Sigh No More is a masterpiece, composed of songs that go through the walk of life. The lyrics are powerful full, of meaning, and come from the heart. The band as a whole exhibits an infatuation for music. What makes Mumford And Sons even better is they're a group where playing live is their roots, they were doing only shows for a long time before going into a studio and making an album. When they made Sigh No More, they based it on how they play live. Thus when one goes to their performances they will not be let down, which always leads to a great experience. Sigh No More has become very main stream, but contains that indie sound that can be associated with underground bands. I highly recommend anyone that likes alternative music, folk music, indie music, or even just anyone looking for a new sound.
159420229X|5.0|Josh Foer not only explains how he came about to become a memorization champion, but details the steps it took him to believe that memorization training to where an average person could memorize vast amounts of data and/or content. He has distilled his research into the history of memorization training in way that is very understandable and enjoyable to read. It's a great book! For those whose short-term memory is pitiful (like me), or for educators who are frustrated with their bright children who can't memorize using rote techniques, \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" will help. It's a must own book.
0307463745|3.0|It is a refreshing book. All heavy burden of formal approaches like \\"mission, vision, strategy\\" etcetera are abandoned. The book has a fast forward pace with regards to the shortest way from idea to realization. However, one can get to far with stripping business processes from formal approaches. As Einstein said: \\"make things as easy as possible, but not easier!\\", and that is exactly the mistake this book makes. Brilliant as it is in stripping processes down to the basics, one should beware on loosing the big picture on behalf of this book. So, it is a good and refreshing read, but you need to keep a certain balance for your own business in mind.

(I had, without remembering or realizing it, read some of his standalones previously, most notably, \\"Blood Work.\\" - Now *there* was good casting.)<br /><br />Reading them all at once I saw too many plot similarities and formula writing, but I did enjoy the works as a whole, and was happy when this new book came out.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"The Fifth Witness\\" is one of Connelly's stronger works, and I enjoyed the simple basics of a courtroom drama.<br /><br />(I also enjoyed a play on words the sharing of which would be a spoiler - but man, I didn't see it coming, and I love it when I get a \\"Wow! That was awesome\\" moment from a book - that alone generally makes it worth the price.)<br /><br />I liked the continuing character development, including the relationship with Connelly's ex-wife (well, wives :: grin :: ) and daughter.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book quite a bit, and expect that anybody who enjoys courtroom dramas.

0545123275|2.0|I began reading this book about 6 weeks ago.  To date, I still haven't finished it. I've read 3 other books in that time.  I probably never will finish it.<br /><br />The storyline is decent....but the character development is terrible.  I have no emotions towards the characters.  If I read the next chapter and they died, that would be OK with me.  I need a page turner.  True, what is a page turner for me may not be a page turner for you, but I honestly have no desire to finish this book, and probably never will.<br /><br />I purchased this book because I think it came up as a recommendation on Amazon based on the fact I read the Twilight series.  This book can't hold a candle to the characters in Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, or Breaking Dawn.  If you want a page turner, look elsewhere.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|I'd like to go on an on about all the features, but simply put this little application opens up PDF's without any effort, and lets me read them. I can pinch and zoom and that's all that I care for it to do.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|It's a nice album, but I only really, really like a few of the songs.  I thought that I would like all of the songs like I do on Fantasia's Doing Me album; you know the ones that you keep hitting the replay button.  I hope Jennifer decides to do more songs with R. Kelly, on her next project.

B001B7CNY2|1.0|This movie shamelessly says is \\"based on real events\\". As I believe a U-Boat veteran said about this movie, the only thing \\"real\\" about it is that there were German U-Boats in the Atlantic Ocean during WWII; the rest is absolute fiction. This movie is not only an insult to the real British seamen who captured the Enigma; it's also an insult to every soldier from every nationality (including USA) who fought against the Germans.    I believe enough time has passed since WWII to portray the enemy in a realistic way, and not just as propaganda caricatures. The Germans in this movie are all portrayed as savage, stupid cowards who cannot shot straight. You have to wonder how a bunch of incompetent cowards, with no shooting ability whatsoever, could conquer almost all of Europe, and how it took almost six years to defeat them.    The string of sheer idiotic plot points is too long to list, but let me just point to some. The experienced German sub crew is fooled into believing an American sub is actually German by simply painting a swastika and soldering a couple of pieces of metal on it. They also aren't resourceful enough to fix their own submarine, but the Americans have it up and running in a matter of seconds even though only one of them speaks German. Even more insulting to the intelligence of the public is that every shot the Americans fire is a miraculous hit, while the Germans miss everything in sight.    It insults the accomplishment of the Allies to portray the enemy as totally incompetent idiots. Their victory is worthless if it's gained against an enemy made up of cowards. This film is a pile of garbage that spits on the graves of the heroic men, from all sides, who fought in WWII.
0783225733|4.0|The movie was in great condition.  No scratches on the disc.  A little wear and tear to the case but it didn't effect the quality of the disc.
B000TGJ80S|1.0|Honestly, I wish Bram Stoker had been a vampire, just so he could hunt down those who participated in this movie.    Let me start off by saying I love the book. And I adore every actor who starred in this movie! Especially Anthony Hopkins, whose Hannibal Lecter was exactly as I had imagined him. And then, when I found out it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, I became super excited. This movie was going to be the best based-on-a-book movie ever!    How dreadfully wrong I was.    The movie follows the same basic plot, true, but in the very loosest sense of the term! Dracula is NOT supposed to be a sympathetic creature. He is supposed to scare the crap out of the reader/viewer! The few things I liked were the 'prequel' sequence in the beginning of the movie, and the fact that both Hopkins and Gary Oldman did a great job of acting. However, the praise stops there. Keanu Reeves with a British accent? Bad idea. It sounded like he was constipated every time he spoke. And Winona Ryder? She's a good actress, but she's nothing like Mina is supposed to be. Mina is sweet and loyal, not horny for a vampire who looks like he's starting to crumple up into himself and/or going moldy. I was severely creeped out. And if you ask me, she plays the part of a crazed, love-sick woman just a bit too well. (See the movie The Crucible for further proof.)    On the whole, I'm glad it was on TV so I didn't waste the $2 it would've cost me to rent it from my local video store.
B000JML90Y|5.0|If you are apprehensive about buying this book because you think it may insult your religious beliefs you have nothing to fear! Darwin doesn't even talk about religion in the book.   Some may, however, find that the book does contradict their beliefs and I don't think that I can say much to sway them. The only thing I can suggest is that you study your faith a little more closely and try to make amends to your beliefs.   All in all, even if you are a fundamentalist of your faith and not likely to accept evolution, I still encourage you to buy the book. It's a very important piece of literature, not only in science and history, but it provides an interesting way in which we view ourselves and this, regardless of your beliefs, is likely to interest you and, hopefully, get you thinking about life a little more deeply.    This is a great book and I would consider it a shame if you didn't read it because of your beliefs.
B004N66XYE|3.0|I was eager to see this updated and continued saga, but I found the new UpStairs, Downstairs had only faint qualities of the original. Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed the story of the Bellamy family when it was first aired, I wished for more than the 3 hours. There wasn't enough time to learn to care about any of the characters as the story line barely brushed over them and hurriedly wrapped up to a disappointing ending leaving too many loose ends.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Got this app as a freebie from Amazon and it is not too bad.  Had problems at first opening it then i went to amazon, clicked on the app and used the open button and have not a problem opening since.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I loved the game, but wish it would have been longer.  I also would have liked an ending to the story with a little more finality.  The story kind of left me hanging.  I had no problems at all installing or playing on the HTC EVO  Shift.

0671646788|5.0|I was starting to believe I was falling into the downward spiral into depression.  I'm half way through this book and I had to create a review. This book helped me exponentially.  I feel very motivated and inspired after each chapter to work on my dream - and this book is a real great push in the right direction.  Look no further, you NEED this book.
081095415X|5.0|I received an email with a video of these wonderful photos and since I've spent time in Africa I looked up the Photograher and was excited to find the photos in book form.  The book exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants truly beautiful pictures that showcase not only the beauty of the animals but the wonder of Africa itself.
B0000507OD|4.0|This lengthy examination on the large-scale, take-no-prisoners lives of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles examines just how much the two personalities had in common, how their winding roads intersected, and why a high-stakes showdown was almost inevitable once the Welles parade stormed Hollywood. It's a thorough, unbiased glimpse into both men's lifestyles, triumphs, mistakes and defining moments. The documentary is a bit on the long side, but in retrospect I can't imagine which slab of material could've been sliced away. It's all integral to the big picture. Considering all that led up to it and everything that worked against it, it's something of a miracle this film ever saw the light of day. That it turned out as good as it did is nearly unimaginable.
0316236535|5.0|I'm a preschool teacher. I purchased this book from amazon. It's a good book and a good prize. My students enjoy looking at this book :) I would recommend this book it's short and nice!
0385335997|4.0|I have been reading all of these books and have more to go.  I find them very interesting but would really like to read them without all the explicit sex.  Tho it is not continuous it is not really necessary to make the books A-1 in my list.  I will read all of them as soon as I purchase them anyhow.
B003UESJHY|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  My family saw it in the theater and just had to add it to our home collection.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|This movie I vote to be the worse in the series that I have seen.  I watched the movie and felt as though I had not even watched a movie.  It dragged on too long.  Reading the book was far more entertaining.    People you can watch it, if you dare, but beware it is boring.
B004N66XYE|5.0|I loved the old UpDown and had high expectations for the reneweal/continuation or whatever you want to call it.  First off, it can't be as good as the original is in my head because they had several seasons and storylines to remember. My first impression of the original show was not pleasant because the production values were awful and the acting a bit stiff....go back and watch.  This new offering has a lot of promise with a proven writer and gifted cast.  The main problem is it's too short.  You can almost see the action being telescoped as motives go missing and they don't let scenes breathe much, but they are definitely on to something here.  The writers and producer did a great job of introducing characters but you don't really get to know anyone well...yet. You get first impressions, hints, and towards the end, you finally warm to the Upstairs folks.  Their secrets are revealed and you end up rooting for them all.  I'm curious to see where they go with this as they have set up the continued series nicely.  The time frame is chock full of good stories and I fear for Lady Persie's life.  Yes, her character is a brat and unpleasant but so was Ms. Mitford (on whom she was based.)  Stoppard is a bit stiff but that is the character...he does melt nicely on a few occasions.  Atkins and Hawes are terrific, not always appealing, but terrific.  Of the downstairs crew, Scarborough as Pritchard steals the show.  More please!
0670022411|1.0|Do not waste your time or money on this poorly written piece of wasted space.  There is no plot, no character development, just a whole lot of tea drinking, toast eating, and waiting for something to happen.  I generally read the reviews before investing in reading material and I regret not having paid more attention to the 1 star commentaries.  Obviously the intellectual acuity of those leaving the 5 star reviews is questionable.
1439177783|4.0|She says exactly what every anorexic does not want you to hear. She says what we all were thinking. And she shows us that if there's a will, there's a way...out of it. That it takes time, and a lot of work, but the light at the end of the tunnel soons becomes a reality. And she tells it in a way that allowed me to laugh, cry and cringe the whole way trough.  This book has helped me, I can honostly say, maybe it seems that it helped me more given my current location on the path to recovery. I cannot say that it would help a person who is curretly in the throws of the disorder (where the romance has only just begun, and it's very hard to see any other way than the way of the voice), but to someone who is certainly willing to bid ED farewell, this book really shows you that you are not alone and that you CAN over come. It also inspired me to give to my loved ones, to shed a little light on the darkness that was going on inside my head, throughout the period where my disorder had it's firmest grip. I have never read the articulation of my thoughts, and I am grateful that Portia was brave enough to give them life on a page.<br />**That said, if you are someone who knows a person suffering from this disease, I caution that you don't recommend this book, at least not right now...think it through. As I can only speak from experience, I know that when I was just beginning the \\"love affair\\" with my disorder, books like this gave \\"great tips\\" that I would put in to practice to feed the beast. Someone who is in such the frame of mind that they can't seperate autobiographical facts from a \\"how to\\" book, should not be reading this. That would be the only reason I mark is 4 out of 5...it can be dangerous to the fragile, but definitely an asset to the open minded and the strong willed ones who wish to recover,and family/friends that wish to understand.
0345529057|5.0|Just writing a short review so I can rate the product with 5 stars.    Being a newcomer for these series, and a die hard for printed books, I couldn't be any happier with this release.   The quality of paper isn't garbage at all, it's thin white paper, which is understandable due to the length of the books. No missing pages, and the box and new covers are just beautiful.    A great option for those who want to read the books and can't easily find them, specially in countries where the series aren't very popular.

1591843162|5.0|It's human nature to doubt. Doubting becomes our habit. And habits are what we think and do, without thinking. If you doubt you can do something big - you know, bigger than you've ever done, but it's always been something you've dreamt and wanted to do - than I highly recommend Seth's book. It's like having a pocket-coach, readily available whenever you need help in breaking old habits. Breaking old habits is the toughest thing out there. We should thank our Creator for placing Seth Godin here.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really like this version of a Zombie book. As a fan of Zombie movies, I really enjoyed the way this one was written. You could almost feel like it is a movie in the making, or at least a documentary done on the (alternate history) \\"period\\".    Recommended.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is a great game!  I loved the themes and loved the updates, except for the easter update.  After updating for easter, it no longer shows up on my phone.  When I try to reinstall, it fail or force closes.  Not sure what happedened with my easter update, but PLEASE fix becasue I need my easter fix of Angry Birds.  Droid X.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I bought this adapter to hook up my monitor to my MacBook Pro and it works great. Here on amazon is where I found the best deal and purchasing from them, as always, was a good experience.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is now my very favorite zombie show bar none! Better than most if not all zombie movies (gasp!)  So incredibly impressed with the tone of the series, the actors are amazing, the human story is awesome, & it just keeps me wanting more. Looking for campy or one liners? This is not for you! People making wisecracks during this series irritate me ;-P<br />Bonus features, behind the scenes stuff is just awesome for zombie fans too!
B003Y74AXO|3.0|The Ipad screen...to protect or not protect.  This is a tough choice.  I'm a fan of screen protectors BUT I don't like the way it makes the screen feel after you apply them. It drives me CRAZY if I get bubbles all over the place.  First things first, you need to be patient and focused before working with the screen protector. Turn off your device, clean your iPad, make sure that there are no lints, dirts or dusts.  If you take your time, you will like this product.  If you don't take your time with the installation, you will hate this product because of the bubble you'll get.  I wasn't impressed with the anti-glare but overall for the price it's a pretty good deal.  There are some better products out there but they will cost more money.  This product sits right in the the middle.  Not too cheap but not that expense. I wish installation was a little easier but all of these screen protector are the same.  If your looking for a way to protector your precious Ipad and don't want to frop 30-40 bucks, use this...you'll just have to get the installation right.<br /><br />Good Luck!
B004132I20|5.0|Had to buy this after watching Season 1 on Masterpiece Theater.    Finally a smart Sherlock Holmes - not a case of not enough information but Sherlock being smarter to solve the crimes - at least smarter than me to solve it first.  Really well cast.. loved the modernization of the characters.  Love all the little quips going on between the characters, including Mrs. Hudson.  Only negative is that it only had 3 episodes in Season 1.  Can't wait for Season 2!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I thought the movie was very deep, in trying to figure out what her problems were.  Natalie really deserved the oscar, she was fabulous in her role. The content of the film was complexed, not sure why she was so troubled in her life.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Maybe, because I know something about how books are adapted to folm, I'm more tolerant of what was left out. You simply can not show how long Harry stayed at Grimvauld Place or the forrest of Dean, it would turn the film into a 4 very boring 4 hours. It is very fast moving film with of course a lot of action. The only bad thing I can say against it is that it shot in the dark. You have to watch it in dark.
B001LF347E|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, and can highly recommend it for many reasons. The music was well done and often epic enough to make people in the next room wander in asking if I was watching the lord of the rings trilogy! The acting was overall excellent, the storylines well done and the landscapes and environments were beautiful. The special effects were a bit spotty, but this is television and there are budgets and time considerations so I wasn't expecting brilliance there. Very good for tv of course. I'd have to say that the show is probably meant for young adults, but its enjoyable if you are not expecting very intricate plots. I enjoyed season one enough to buy the second season, and that was even better.    I have only one issue with season one, and you should stop here if you wish to avoid even a hint of spoilers.     My only complaint with season one was how very little changed during the course of the show. There were no major relationship changes, no major revelations, no major deaths (perhaps one minor side death). Things 'reset' to a comfortable norm by the end of episodes, which can be rather dull after a time because you start to anticipate that new enemies don't really mean anything, as everything will just go back to the way it was and everyone will live happily ever after at the end of it all. I'm happy to say, this is NOT an issue in season two. If you liked season one, you will like the show even more as it progresses. I gave season one 4 stars mostly because of this, but would gladly give 5 for the next season.
B004G6009K|5.0|If you want to create one of those memorable moments with your 6 year old grand daughter sitting in your lap then this is the movie to get. The 3D effect are AWESOME. This movie sets the bar for all other 3D Blu-ray movies to achieve or try to surpass.  Word cannot expressed my enjoyment and pleasure while watching this movie.  Definitely one to get.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Even though this song came out in 1978-79, I consider Van Halen one of the top Hair bands of the 80's. IMO, I believe that David Lee Roth was one of the best Hard Rock male vocalist of his time. I mainly bought this CD for the song titled \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\". I love the guitar riff in this song by Van Halen. I love the way Van Halen plays guitar. His style of playing guitar playing is unique and set the standard of the way many guitarist play today. I highly recommend this CD. Buy it!
B003KGBISY|5.0|This is only the 4th Criterion Blu-Ray release that I've seen after [[ASIN:B00393SFU2 M (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B003ZYU3T6 Modern Times  (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B00393SG0G Stagecoach (The Criterion Collection)]] but it is by far the best overall release that I've seen so far.  This version of \\"Seven Samurai\\" firstly comes in a beautiful mostly cardboard digipak format with an excellent 56-page booklet containing great essays and even Mifune \\"in his own words\\" which in itself is worth the price.  We get two discs here: one of the great film and the other full of special features the highlights of which are the Kurosawa interviews.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent having been very, very well restored and while not pristine perfect is still very good to watch and one cannot overstate just how much better black and white films look on 1080p.  The sound quality is also good although personally I would have liked to have had a DTS HD MA lossless 5.1 surround option but perhaps this mono is the best they could do.  The box states that this option DTS-HD is available but I couldn't find it when I tried looking for it in the setup menu.  I was able to get this option with the many other blu-rays that I have but not this one and so it is not an equipment setup issue; perhaps I just got a bad disc or maybe it's just false advertising.  I had to just watch the Japanese LPCM Mono version which again is not bad but I believe could be better.<br /><br />It is a testament to the brilliance of this film that despite the fact that it runs more than 3 hours, I did not suffer the squeaky bum syndrome as I really enjoyed it so much that I wasn't aware of the time; in fact I was disappointed when it ended.  I also didn't like the intermission at around the 1 and a half hour mark as I just wanted to continue watching.  I've seen many films: \\"Casablanca\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\" etc but I have to say that \\"Seven Samurai\\" overall is the best I've seen so far.  I'm planning to watch \\"Seventh Seal\\" soon but until then, this is the best I've seen.  It's just great film-making from every possible angle of evaluation.  Kurosawa has often stated that he's a fan of Westerns and of John Ford and you actually see the influence here as when I was watching parts of this film like at the start when the farmers and a couple of samurai were walking into town and making a barn their temporary base of operations it felt just like watching a John Ford western.  How ironic that a John Ford western inspires a Japanese samurai film which goes back to inpiring the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch\\" westerns!<br /><br />I loved the theme of the film of how doing the right thing for the sake of honor, integrity and the service of others is the ultimate reward in itself and is the bushido spirit in its purest form; to defend those who cannot defend themselves without expecting anything in return and that self-sacrificing spirit makes this the ultimate good versus evil film for me.  Mifune is the most famous of the actors here but truly all the actors are excellent making this the lastest addition of the very few films that I look forward to watching on my annual classic film viewing list and there are not many of these at this point.<br /><br />Simply astounding and a must-have in any self-respecting movie fan's video library.<br /><br />Very, very, highly recommended!ar.

B004PGO25O|2.0|This was a nice book. It only took an hour for me to get through it. However, I was able to read it for free through a special promotion. After reading it, I liked the contents - sorta like a pep rally for you to not doubt yourself and to go take action. But other than that, nothing earth shattering. Not sure I would have been as happy if I had just paid $10.

B004FN7ZOC|4.0|The sound is typical Amon Amarth, which is a good thing to me. They have matured in their songwriting and continue to do what they do best. I didn't give the album 5 stars because I give 5 stars is for the best of the best. I would give Versus the World 5 stars because it is my favorite album from them. With that said, you will not be let down with this album. Any Amon Amarth fan should be happy with it. Amon Amarth is one of my favorite bands because as long as they have been together they haven't changed members that much and are consistent in their sound. They are kickass live too!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Soy una persona de un pais latinoamericano llamado Honduras... y es algo dificil que los discos lleguen aca despues de su lanzamiento, tardan de uno a dos meses!... definitivamente no podia esperar, asi que lo pedi, por amazon para que lo enviaran a un currier que se encarga de mandarlos a sus destinos... porque Britney es Britney, no puedo esperar dos meses a que algo tan bueno como este disco tarde 2 meses en llegar... definitivamente es algo que solo por ella haria, y aunque quizas el costo sea de unos pocos lempiras (moneda nacional) mas elevado, vale la pena, es un disco, bueno, rico para escuchar, sentir y bailar, casi que me pierdo y me transporto a otro lado cada que lo escucho... no es el tipico disco que tiene 3 canciones movidas buenas y un resto de liricas tristes y sentimentales, ojo, no con ello estoy diciendo que las letras carezcan de sentido, es un disco que ha sabido acomodar todas las liricas en una experiencia musical que te envuelve de manera unica, que te hace querer bailar, cantar, saltar, apagar las luces, just be yourself... bueno cualquier cantidad de cosas son las que siento cada que lo reproduzco, es bueno para una muy buena party, es bueno para una bailada en una disco, es bueno para estar escuchando again and again and again mientras conduces... que te digo, Britney es Britney y si bien es cierto cada que regresa, viene con algo muy bueno, aqui se lucio y supo complacer con creces a todos aquellos fans que cada a&ntilde;o esperamos con algo impregnado de su fabuloso sello!... thanx
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I found clips on YouTube and immediately knew I had to purchase this DVD! It's a marvelous presentation -- not a documentary, but a dramatic and historically realistic film. The acting is tremendous. John Adams and his wife, Abigail, corresponded while separated -- which they were for many years at a time -- and so there was a great deal of information available to make the film. Also, the story gives one a better idea as to how difficult and dangerous it was to start the United States of America, and how bickering and opposing ideas plagued the founding fathers. Just this weekend, I saw it in the store for approx. 2 1/2 times what Amazon charges, which made my purchase at Amazon twice as sweet! I love the film and so did my husband -- we'll definitely watch it again and again.
1591843790|5.0|OK - here's the disclaimer: I'm a big Kawasaki fan and was so drawn into his facebook pre-book posts that I almost pre-ordered the book twice. And I wasn't let down in any way. The book reads like Kawasaki sounds in person - and that's a great thing. It turns out that enchantment is created by three simple things: be likeable, be trustworthy and have a great cause. Of course, achieving these things isn't all that simple. The book certainly makes them achievable, though. Concepts are presented clearly and the book is studded with examples and stories. It's conversational, it's clear, it's brilliant and it made me laugh. This is a book I'll be buying for clients.
0375842209|5.0|While there are elements of this book that are obviously aimed toward the younger readers, such as illustrations and drawings, the story itself is appropriate for readers who are teenagers or older. The use of Death as the narrator is unique, but not troublesome enough to make the story difficult to read. I think of this novel as the opposite side of the coin from \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" as it provides a view of everyday life in Germany during World War 2 and an account of a family that is hiding a Jew in their home. It is a stark tale that might upset younger readers, and yet it is also a book about survival and about the terrible costs of war on the general populace. \\"The Book Thief\\" is a gripping story that will haunt you long after you have finished reading it.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I'll admit that my first reaction to hearing about this show was mild distaste. It sounded like just another trashy teen show. My roommate watched it, though, and I saw bits and pieces now and then, but not enough to understand what was happening. After only a few weeks of just watching a minute or two of each episode, I was hooked.     Sure, when you try to explain the premise to someone, it sounds a bit idiotic: four girls trying to solve a friend's murder while being stalked. What's almost impossible to describe is the utterly addictive quality this show has.     The four girls grow on you quickly. They all have their secrets, their faults, their moments of stupidity, their moments of brilliance. Most importantly is that eventually these girls become beloved to the audience. Hanna, who has to deal with her father's departure, but she's also the most badass of the girls. Aria, whose student/teacher relationship is the center of the romantic tension, but her love for literature and her maturity will grow on you. Emily, whose struggles with her sexuality never seem cheap or overdone, but true and beautiful. Spencer, by far my favorite, who is intelligent and snarky and has to deal with an increasingly hellish home life. Though perhaps described this way, they might not seem too fascinating or deep, but their friendships always feel true-to-life and I've never had any complaints against their acting or characterization.     As with any show of this type, each girl has many romances. This is another way the show excels. Sure, I get tired of Aria and Ezra after a while, but the fact that these are 16-year-old girls who are just trying to figure out their emotions makes this aspect seem very real. Some of them are absolute gems -- any time Emily has to work through her problems, Hannah's relationships with Caleb and especially Lucas, and my personal favorite: Spencer's romance at the end of the season, which is my absolute favorite aspect of the show in general.      The show is witty and fast-paced, with equally fascinating side characters -- to me, this show would be nothing without Toby Cavanaugh, for example. A, their nemesis who stalks and blackmails the girls, is a great villain and will have you guessing his/her identity and not trusting anyone in this show. Of course, the main mystery of the season is trying to figure out who killed Alison, their best friend, but the more you hear about Alison, the more confused you'll become. Very little is answered in this season, but that just adds to its charm.     The addictive quality, as I said, cannot be properly described. I started watching this near the end of the series, and I went back and watched the first 18 or so episodes in two days. The show is riveting. You always want to know who killed Ali, who A is and what ridiculous tactic he/she will have next, and what will happen to the Pretty Little Liars.     This show is, simply, the best on ABC Family, and one of my all-time favorites in general. I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did, so if you aren't watching it because it sounds contrived... well, maybe the premise is, but I assure you that the result is an amazing show you'll want to watch over and over again. I certainly do.
B0034KZE2W|5.0|I got these shoes for Christmas in 2009 and a year and a half later they still rock (I'm wearing them right now!).  I worked as an aquatic ecologist for a season and took these backpacking with me as my \\"water survey\\" shoes (ie I wore them through ponds and meadows looking for amphibians).  Half-way through my season, in the middle of an 8-day work week, the night before I had to go back out on the trail for an overnight trip my crappy hiking boots fell apart.  My Crocs were the only shoes I had, so I wore them for a 14-hour day of surveying and hiking cross-country.  They lack a bit in traction, but honestly they held up amazingly even after that day of scrambling over granite outcropings and downed logs.  I have a bad back and bad knees, but they never give me problems in my Crocs.  Seriously, the best $30 I've ever spent (or, had spent on me :)  When this pair finally falls apart, I'll buy the same dang shoes to replace them.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|EDIT:  After further reflection, I decided to bump this up to four stars.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a compelling story that I read in a single sitting because I found it to be a fast-paced, interesting read.  It features a girl name Katniss along with 23 other participants in a barbaric fight-to-the-death \\"game\\" that is supposed to serve as entertainment for the nation as well as some kind of deterrent to rebellion.<br /><br />I marked the story down half a star because I felt it was a bit lacking in setup to explain how North America devolved into a society called \\"Panem\\" that pits kids against each other in death matches.  I would have appreciated some more back story to explain what happened 74+ years ago to form the various districts and the reasoning behind the \\"games\\". I realize this is a trilogy, and that might get explained in later books; however, I felt it would be essential information to include in the first book.<br /><br />I marked the story down a second half star because it seems unsporting to mix 12 to 18-year-olds together in a death match.  Imagine going to a football game and you have 6th graders playing against seniors in high school.  The game would be incredibly lopsided and frankly -- quite boring.  I think the Hunger Games would be just as boring watching overpowered competitors demolish the weak competitors.  I also think it would be boring to watch weak competitors that have little to no survival skills trying to survive the elements let alone the other competitors.  I'm by no means advocating death matches for entertainment, but in a society that does, I think it would be much more competitive to have participants that are closer in age and abilities.<br /><br />In closing, this was a riveting story, but in the back of mind, I kept thinking \\"I'm reading about a bunch of kids killing each other!\\"  I'm hopeful later books in the series will develop a rebellion that will put an end to these horrific games.
B004N66XYE|2.0|Hi I had great hopes  for this production after watching the beautiful production of Downton Abbey on PBS earlier this seson, and watching again and remembering the first great Upstairs Downstairs.   Iwas intrigued to see if this production could measure up to the other production   What a dissapiointment It was awful !!! Even the great Jan Marsh couldn't save this turkey It stinks The best charaters were the Halham's Mom and her distinguished Indian secetary, the  cook, and the maid Ivy    The plot was terrible The bit with Agnes's younger sister Persie's involvment with the chauffer and the Politiccal Cause was a blatent rip-off of a similiar story-line in Downton Abby    The characters of Agnes Persie Hallam ,the Butler and eve Jean Marshe's Rose were weak I would save mu money and go to your local library and rent the video Rose
0307595579|4.0|I was informed by a friend who has read these volumes that it was a murder mystery. I had to wade through a tremendous amount of characters and their history which was very detailed and was half way through the first book before the murder was ever presented.  The same is true for the 2nd volume except most of the same characters were described and after reading the 1st volume,they were very familiar.  Again the murder did not occur until half the book was read. Altogetner it was fascinating reading but not the kind that one had to stay up all night and could not put down.  I am currently half through volume 2 and hope to finish before the end of the month.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|FINALLY got to watch this to the end.  The worst I can say about it is that it is \\"the end\\" of a wonderfully acted and thought provoking series.  Considering the dilema the writers created for themselves with all the mysteries of the island, I was impressed with the way they decided to wrap things up.  These episodes delivered the same type of quality that all the other seasons did.  Creavity, identifiable characters, and the \\"leave you wanting more\\" feeling at the end of each individual episode.      I should add that I never expected everything about this series to all make sense in the end.  Fantasy is not about everything fitting neatly into the box, it's exploring the possiblities outside the box.     The only character I thought should have appeared in the final few moments of the program was Mr. Echo. It was a setting and plot that would have really suited a revival of his character.  As for \\"Walt's\\" character missing from the series end.........not sure what to say.  He would not be the child who started in the whole thing.  As a grown man it would just not be the same anyway, and I don't think he was an important enough role in the overall scheme of the series to miss very much.      If you are hesitating to purchase this set based on a less than five star rating and some disgruntled reviews, don't.  It's still worth watching if you are a real fan.

B002E2M5IC|1.0|WAY over rated!! I couldn't get past the music references which were about records released in 1970 and the movie was taking place in 1967. The whole opening was not referenced at all in the rest of the movie. Why was it there? The story about the teeth. WHY? There was no resolution or answer to anything. It was funny in a couple of spots, but beyond that-nothing. I LOVE all the other Cohen Bros films, but this was a bomb. What kind of ending was that? The whole thing was just a plain mess. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid!
B004WE01YA|1.0|Please don't think that the reason I gave this only 1 star was because I didn't like this movie.  I absolutely LOVE this movie and it's one of my all time favorite animated movies.  Let me explain the reason for this review.  I don't know about anyone else, but I'm kind of ticked off at this release.  I just went out and bought this blu-ray last October when it was first released as a \\"Diamond Edition\\" blu-ray.  Now they're re-releasing it in 3D?  That kind of sucks considering that I'm planning on buying a 3D tv in about a month.  Now it looks like I might have to re-buy this movie.  I hate when studios keep releasing newer versions of their movies.  We, as fans, can't wait forever to buy one of the versions, but we hate to run out and buy the first one knowing that there might be a better version released soon after (this 3D version for example).  So what are we to do?  If they were going to release a 3D version of this film on blu-ray, I wish they would've just waited one more year and only released this one.  I'd love to have this movie in 3D, but I'm really not sure I want to spend another 30 bucks on a second copy of this blu-ray.  Bummer.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|I have been a fan of Amon Amarth since their \\"Versus the World\\" album. I was drawn to their melodic death sound and Viking-influenced lyrics since the song \\"Death in Fire\\". I am not highly knowledgeable about death and black metal, nor do I pretend to be. I can only relate this Amon Amarth to my own listening experience. There sound is based on a cookie monster-type death vocal that reminds me of the best lyrical moments of Six Feet Under, Arch Enemy, Mortification, and Fear Factory. However I think Amon Amarth's vocalist has a higher quality voice with more sustain and a greater range than most death vocalists, with the exception of Arch Enemy's Angela Gossow. Amon Amarth uses a guitar duo that is detuned but not excessively detuned. They don't play many solos, but they play a lot of guitar melodies and harmonies that have the effect of making the pitchless vocals sound more melodic. The drums are driven by double-bass, but they are not headache inducing like a lot of similar bands are. Their lyrics are about Norse mythology, Vikings, riding/sailing off to war, fate, valiant death, and meeting one's ancestors.<br /><br />Amon Amarth are a band that is known for doing the same thing over and over, but that is not a bad thing. They are almost a Viking melodo-death answer to AC/DC, a band that does the same thing for an entire career and makes it somehow comforting, familiar, and totally awesome rather than ever getting old. \\"Surtur Rising\\" is more of the same in their usual vein, but somehow they do it better. Their songwriting is more focused, guitar melodies better written, lyrics more interesting, performance is higher quality, and production value is way higher than anything they have done since Versus the World. There are probably no songs here quite as catchy as \\"Death in Fire\\" and \\"Across the Rainbow Bridge,\\" but some of these songs come close. This album is slightly better than \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" and much better than \\"Fate of Norms\\". If you like metal and are considering Amon Amarth, you can't go wrong with this album. If you are already a fan of the band, this is one of their best.<br /><br />Plus there is a long bonus live DVD consisting of 33 tracks from a complete concert  in 2008. The DVD has very high audio and video quality, and I am totally blown away by the band's stamina and ability to play such a long set.nsidering Amon Amarth, you can't go wrong with this album.

B003E6K1VK|3.0|Everything that other reviewers said about the sound output for this product holds true for me. It's Absolutely amazing! My Audio Technicas ATH M50's are finally driven to their full potential when plugged to my Ipod through the E7.   My only grief... and the reason i am returning it, is that the OLED display is short lived. After 9 days of usage and using the lock key function to turn off the display after 1 min, i notice a very distinctive and growing darkening/dying patch starting on the top right corner of the screen. I've read somewhere else that OLEDs have a very short lifespan, but never it occurred  to me that after 9 days it would start is slow decay. I hope the next version of the E7 has a different type of display since i'm sure it's very hard to operate it with a dead screen.

Bruce and his parents leave \\"The Mark of Zorro,\\" they go down an alley, a gunman demands Bruce's mother's pearls and Bruce's father defends her.  Shots are fired, the parents die, Bruce lives and Batman is born.  In \\"Jonah Hex,\\" they do the complicated origin in a quick, badly animated sequence that really says nothing.  You shouldn't be surprised that the rest of the movie sucks.
B0013K6WLM|4.0|The Black Keys have an unusually great sound.  What drives me nuts is their habit of repeating melodies and thinking that playing a verse at a different volume with different lyrics is a hook.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I can't say much that hasn't been said about this album.  It's 14 years old now and sounds more \\"current\\" than most of the stuff that passes for music these days.  It's an incredible achievement that caught Radiohead in an important transition from the pseudo-pop sensibility of The Bends (although in hindsight a song like \\"Just\\" portended O.K.

0689835604|3.0|This book is a favorite of my daughter's. She has just turned one and is very curious about everything. Since this is a \\"lift the flap\\" book she is able to uncover hidden things. She loves to lift the flap and find a different image underneath. It captures her attention for a long time.    One negative comment would be the quality of the flaps themselves. They are quite flimsy and can easily be ripped. Since it is a favorite book it is going to get worn quickly. I would prefer the flaps were a heavier material to make sure that the tiny reader won't be ripping them off by mistake. Not only is ripping a threat but bending is as well. If they were of a harder cardboard the book would last longer.    The illustrations are cute and they show different children in different scenarios. It has a diverse cast of characters in different settings ranging from the kitchen table, to the bathtub, to the crib.     The Ahgoo Review rating is 3 out of 5.    The low rating is solely because of the poor quality of the flaps. Since is could shorten the life of the book it is a large factor.     ahgooreview.blogspot.com
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Based on historical accounts of the turmoil that gripped Alexandria once Christianity became the favored religion of the Roman Empire,  it's easy to see how it took hold so quickly, spreading among slaves and the uneducated.  For their part, the pagan elite didn't see the danger of this new religion until it was too late, and they underestimated its hold on their servants.  The loss of so much knowledge and art is heartbreaking.  Cinematography was amazing, even if much is also CGI effects.  Rachel Weisz is amazing as Hypatia, last of the great pagan scholars.  A look of how those ancient events might have played out, Agora is thought-provoking epic masterpiece.

B004I1AGTM|4.0|For longer than a moment, I thought that Ip Man's brash and impulsive young pupil, Wong Leung, was the Bruce Lee character. But, doing the math, Leung was actually some years older than Bruce would've been at this stage. And, it turns out, Wong Leung is also a real person. But there's a marked resemblance between Bruce Lee and the actor who plays Leung. Anyway, fear not, Bruce Lee does eventually make an appearance, but it's not until the film's just about over and it constitutes such a brief moment that I was disappointed.<br /><br />IP MAN 2: LEGEND OF THE GRANDMASTER brings back Donnie Yen as the staggeringly accomplished Grandmaster of Wing Chun, and the story picks up from the first film. In 1950, having fled the Japanese-occupied town of Foshan, Ip Man and his wife and young son make a new home at British-occupied (some say British-oppressed) Hong Kong, wherein Ip Man attempts to found a martial arts school showcasing his Foshan Wing Chun style. It's hard going at first, with Ip Man struggling to provide for his family and initially no students in sight. Ip Man isn't clued in to local hierarchy, this pecking order instituted by the different kung fu schools in Hong Kong. Ip Man has yet to pay his dues. It seems that news of his Japanese-stomping exploits back in Hoshan haven't yet made the rounds. Ip Man wishes the Twitter account had been invented back in 1950.<br /><br />Custom dictates that, to establish credibility, Ip Man must accept challenges from rival kung fu masters, which leads us to one of the film's highlight sequences: Ip Man, precariously balanced on a wobbly table taking on one challenger after another, eventually facing off against the highly skilled master of the Hung Kuen style, played by Sammo Hung. A major plot point concerns the tension between Ip Man and Sammo Hung's Master Hung. Master Hung leads Hong Kong's consortium of sifus; he dictates policies, sets monthly dues. Master Hung is also the resentful lackey to a corrupt British policeman, an accomplice to the bullying foreign white devil's racketeering and exploitation of the Chinese populace. There comes a point in which Master Hung must choose between honor and financial gain. How he responds will inspire Ip Man to take on his most formidable foe yet, the boorish boxing champion Mr. Twister, in a bout between eastern and western boxing.<br /><br />If it's cool with everyone, why don't we just make it official and dub Donnie Yen as the new king of Hong Kong cinema? Yen is so perfect in this role and very charismatic, and I marvel at his blend of skill and acting. Yen's thoughtful interpretation underscores the fact that this Ip Man is older and even more contemplative (and he certainly takes more of a beating). Slender and unassuming, on the surface calm and accommodating, but masking depths of resolve. Ip Man is slow to anger, and prefers exhausting all peaceable options before reluctantly lifting up his fists. But underneath the conciliatory smile is a layer of swagger, yo. It only surfaces when Ip Man is forced to accept a challenge fight or when he's extremely fed up.<br /><br />It's crazy how wing chun is so very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and it's a pleasure to watch Donnie Yen execute the wing chun style with such control and expertise. It doesn't hurt that Sammo Hung also puts on his action director pants. Four core combat sequences ignite the film. Ip Man and his pupil Leung fend off a horde of goons at the fish market, and Ip Man unveils his hurtful application of a pallet (somewhere here, we also see Siu-Wong Fan return as a reformed Master Jin). The most visually stunning fight is probably Ip Man on the wobbly round table taking on all comers, with choreography making excellent use of wire work. We look on as Master Hung steps into the ring with Mr. Twister to defend the honor of Chinese boxing, and Sammo Hung shows he's still pretty damn spry. Finally, there's the big showdown between Twister and Ip Man, with Ip Man havinga harder time of it than initially assumed. Sorry, but as much as I love western-style boxing, I don't buy that a great pugilist can beat a great martial artist. All things even, it seems to me the martial artist just has many more options, and it's more likely that we see the outcome from BEST OF THE BEST 2. But it's interesting, isn't it? Bruce Lee or Manny Pacquiao?<br /><br />IP MAN 2 isn't quite as emotionally gripping. Ip Man's time with his family is still served, I feel, in perfunctory manner, although Ziong Dai Lin (who plays Ip Man's lovely pregnant wife) gets more screen time this time. Familiar themes crop up, and, if you really think about it, one of the major arcs here is just a rehash of the plot from the original film, with the Brits subbing for the Japanese. The show of nationalistic pride is about as subtle as a vicious Ip Man pallet to the face. Stuntman Darren Shahlavi (who plays \\"Twister\\") doesn't advance his acting career with his over-the-top performance. Shahlavi's presence - and everything that goes with featuring a white oppressor in a martial arts film - severely undermines the quality of the movie because, each time, it's presented in such heavy-handed fashion. Very cheesy. Still, the spirit and philosophy of Ip Man - as channeled thru Donnie Yen - command the screen, and IP MAN 2: LEGEND OF THE GRANDMASTER ultimately counts as a passable sequel to what I consider to be an all-time classic. 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one.<br /><br />Two discs for this set. The first disc has the feature presentation, the Making Of the film featurette (00:17:36 minutes long), and three IP MAN 2 trailers. Disc 2 has these extras: the Behind the Sets segment explores four of the sets used in the film: Ip Man's neighborhood, including his residence and the roof which doubles as his wing chun academy (00:02:54), the fish market (00:02:18), the Chinese restaurant (00:02:26), and the big & small arena (00:02:17); Deleted Scenes, including one with Twister beating up on another opponent in the ring (totaling 00:09:06); Shooting Diary (00:03:05); and in-depth interviews with the cast & crew. Note that all the extras come with English sub-titles.a harder time of it than initially assumed.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I bought this book because a friend suggested it as great prep material for an upcoming family vacation to Washington DC this summer.  For that purpose, it was outstanding.  It will provide a great frame of reference for when I am gazing up at the interior of the US Capitol dome in June.  As a story, well, I've read it before in The Da Vinci Code.  Brown is formulaic.  A lot of literary critics and novelists (who can't get published) like to look down their noses at him but his books sell because they are entertaining.  I was entertained reading it.  It was a little bit like when I am entertained by flipping through the channels and finding an episode of Seinfeld I have enjoyed before.  There are times and moods where that Seinfeld hits the spot and then there are times when I go looking for Citizen Kane.  The Lost Symbol just gave me that Seinfeld fix and now I am off to find my next Citizen Kane novel.  Any suggestions?
B004FOA84A|3.0|Easy but not TOO easy.  Good graphics.  Music will not stay muted.  A little short for a paid app.  I look forward to playing more of these kinds of games.
0307279189|5.0|..that I immediately changed my shoes. And, my attitude about ultramarathoners.    also, I went out and bought the book from Amazon, rather than hang on to the copy I had borrowed. Now I'm telling all my friends to read it. At first, I thought it was going to be kind of boring since I'm not much of a runner and have always thought ultramarathoners were sort of crazy. But now, I'm thinking it might actually be FUN to run and run and run and run! What a great story: It reads like a novel in parts. It's my latest favorite non-fiction book.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I enjoy Supernatural so much, and it's the ONLY television program I've ever watched twice.    Not only is there enough mystery and suspense throughout (watch out for the season three finale--I kid you not, I had a nightmare about the safety of one of the characters!), but Dean's dry sense of humor and the pop culture references often make me laugh out loud!  Not to mention, it has a great soundtrack.  I recommend all of the seasons of Supernatural.  I hope it lives on to have more seasons than Buffy!  Good job and good luck to my Supernatural heroes (on and off camera!!!).
044654759X|4.0|I'm only on chapter 20 in this book & I love it so far. I stayed up till 4:30 last night and read over 15 chapters. I could NOT put it down!! I haven't read any of his other books, but I've seen all of the movies. I'm sure they're not the same. I've saw that they're making this into a movie in 2012. Cannot wait. I highly suggest reading this!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Even being a reboot, this fresh release in the evangelion series is a climax to this point and may rise high. Breaking away from the original stereotype it created , I do believe it to be worth every penny.
B0039V8NJC|3.0|Read it quickly as it flows well and is written elegantly. Didn't quite like the perspective/indirect speech/monologue but definitely appreciated the attempt at something different. It's done intelligently and well, it just didn't appeal to my taste. I thought the love story and account of work etc was good...maybe I would have hoped for more depth regarding his dislike of America, even if he did attempt to explain why...I think a few more examples would have fleshed out the story better to understand his conflict. I'm a US citizen who has lived overseas many years, so I think I know what he means by much of what he says...but I also think many readers who haven't got that experience probably don't. The ending disappointed me a little ....like what is happening with the waiter who followed...I would have preferred more closure
B000024D4R|5.0|I say that this Pink Floyd's most cohesive musical statement--it certainly isn't their strongest set songwriting-wise. However, the geometry of the album's construction is unpaired in the entire Floyd discography: three art rock epics that showcase Gilmore's lead playing and Roger's vitriolic social commentary bookended by a typically Floydian two-part ditty. Throughout, the set never lags in  energy; despite the songs' running times (17, 13, and 11 minutes, respectively) it never feels dragged out or jammy. I stand by this album as much or more so than I do \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and I expect any true Floyd fan to do the same.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 2 daughters, 3 & 6 just got this from their grandparents for Easter, we have been dying to see it! IT was well worth the wait.  We watched it as a family, with my husband, 2 kids, and my mother and father, and I\\"ll say; my father who is nearly 60 yrs old falls asleep during boring movies and he was cracking up over this one. We all REALLY enjoyed it. There is enough humor in it to keep everyone happy. The horse was hysterical!  Loved the characters, loved the positive messages it sent out.  IF you read some of the 1*2 star reviews on here about some terrible stabbing scene..RELAX,...it is really not that bad, there isn't even any blood on the knife! They briefly show a little red on his shirt so you know he was hurt,...but they did NOT show the knife going into his body like other people lead you to believe.  Lets not forget that the Beast was killed in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin was a thief yet turned out to be a great guy.  Some people so over react to Disney movies its just ridiculous.     I would highly recommend this movie for ANYONE! Loved it!*****
B0024FAR5M|2.0|I give it 2 stars because its done well (shot well, directed, etc) for the type of show it is but who am I supposed to like on the show? The murderers, the dealers, the mother trying to keep her son from getting a better life, the molesters? I agree with the one reviewer, I never get these type of shows. Why should I care if the guy who sends people out to murder a 16 year old girl gets caught? I want him to get caught.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I agree with the reviewers who thought that the movie was the condensed version. Much is left out of the movie, but I know that from seeing it in the theater rather than watching the DVD. The standard DVD is so dark that the screen is completely black in many places, with only voices rather than picture. Watching this DVD is kind of like listening to a very abridged audio book. And no, it is not my DVD player. I tried the DVD (two at this point) in another DVD player and on my MacBook with the same results. I'm just waiting on the return label so I can send both copies back.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I'm a big fan of most things Star Wars.  I loved the original triology, I liked Revenge of the Sith, would give a nod to episode II and a shrug for episode I.  The Star Wars novels are hit and miss (The Thrawn Triology is the hallmark of any SW novel series), and the comic books are generally amazing.  When it comes to The Clone Wars microseries which preceeded the CG version currently running I was at a loss.  The microseries delivered action at a steady, relentless pace which eclipsed much of the story line and left little to no room for character development.  In regards to the action it is very over the top and unbvelievable even for Star Wars.  If the Jedi were truely capable of the feats shown in the microseries the war would have ended at Geonosis or Mace Windu would have killed Palpatine during their confrontation on Coruscant.  Anyway I'm sure your wondering where my review for the Clone Wars CG Animated series is... well its right here.  The Clone Wars is awesome.  When it comes to cartoons I believe the Japanese are the best and I was delighted to learn that the style in which this series is portrayed was inspired by Japanese anime.  The animation does not degrade the action and lightsaber battles are as breathtaking as ever.  The characters actually resemble the actors who portrayed them in the movies and that is a testement to the talent Lucasfilms has working for it.  When I started watching the series I expected poor dialogue and no character development but I was proven wrong.  The dialogue is good, all though \\"I have a bad feeling about this,\\" needs a rest as it is used at least once or twice per episode.  I actually found myself laughing at the character's remarks and even thinking that a few lines were witty.  To get to the point no one feels out of character when their speaking.  The voice acting is good and only gets better as the series goes on.  The voice actors really capture the essence of their characters, especially Count Dokku and Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious.  Right from the start you get the impression that this is a character driven story which is my favorite kind.  Obiwan is still the calm Jedi Master and Anakan now a Jedi Knight excersises his new authority as a General by disobeying orders because he can.  A great new development for Anakin's character is the addition of his new padawan, Ashoka Tano.  Put simply Ashoka embodies Anakin as a padawan, she is defient, headstrong, a Jedi with seemingly limitless potential, but above all she forms connections.  Ashoka like Anakin understands the Jedi beliefs about forming connections but finds herself unable to not care about her new Master.  In little time at all Anakan finds himself attached to Ashoka as the series progresses and the question is asked can he let her go when the time comes?  Another interesting character is the clone Captain Rex.  Rex represents the clone soldier on the field of battle.  He is loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Generals he serves but he is not a mindless automaton.  Rex has a personality that comes out through the progression of the story.  He looks out for the men under his command and believes that the mark of a good commander is experience.  So all in all The Clone Wars is a great series.  It embodies what Star Wars should be and while it might seem like a show for children it evolves to appeal for all ages.  I'm 22 and can't get enough this show.  So when you watch this series don't let it go right away if your feeling meh, give it time and you'll change your mind.  Like all things this show needs some time to warm up and when it does get ready for Star Wars as it should be.
0553288105|4.0|I am an Asimov fan.  I have read about 15 of his books and keep coming back for more.  I loved this book, especially the second section that describes a fascinating alternative universe. As I finished that part, I was convinced I was reading his best book!  However, he doesn't return to that universe or explain anything further about them.  It was so interesting - I felt a bit cheated.  Very nice science described towards the end of the book but the ending seemed a little flat.  All in all a great read however.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|In concept, Red Riding Hood, and TV shows like CSI have one thing in common: one can not stiff the villain through logic. Shows like CSI can successfully turn out hours of entertainment simply because of the increased use of technology in criminology. They fascinate the audience for thirty minutes, do a couple of interviews, and a DNA sample, and we get our killer. The technology not only simplifies the police's pursuit, but the storytelling that could have been intricate. Identifying the villain in Red Riding Hood is not dissimilar, and seemingly impossible considering the countless choices thrown at out during the film.<br /><br />Red Riding Hood is a folk tale, and as such has received treatment from countless literary and dramatic figures. The character's age also shifts from rendition. In some she's young, and in others, like this, she's well passed puberty, and chasing after a childhood friend. The village has been at peace with the werewolf for years offering him sacrifices every month, and he this hefty bargain has kept the villagers safe for some time. Eventually, the wolf strikes, and kills a villager.  Sickened with his disobedience, the villagers hunt down a wolf, eventually finding out that they have simply slain a regular grey wolf. Eventually, a witch hunter, Father Solomom, is called to hunt the werewolf, whom the villagers believe for a time happens to be their common grey wolf. Father Solomon , exceeding at creating controversy, makes the villagers doubt their sons, daughters, parents, friends, and neighbors. The fear escalates, and the village must put an end to the beast before the fear creates a widespread version of the Salem Witch Trails.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried is THE reason to see this film. It is not a phenomenal performance from her, but she is able to keep this film alive with her acting and beauty. Certain actors like Seyfried, and the virtuoso Meryl Streep,  can make a mediocre film appear likeable without outright sex or nudity-which this film does not contain. Someone like Megan Fox can kiss boys, girls, be surrounded by transformers, and her beauty shines through, but not her acting. Thankfully, the filmmakers knew that they are not dealing with a date film, so they did not inject an overt amount of sexuality in this film. The importance of this is that in that case, it would more familiar a story than it already does. Besides Seyfried, and possibly Julie Christie, every other performance pales in comparison. Basically because the two mentioned characters, every other character only observes the incidents-besides the main love interests-without saying anything worth mentioning. Even the versatile Gary Oldman gives an over-the-top performance, but not an entirely memorable one.<br /><br />The identity of the werewolf is a mystery that most not deeply be pondered. There are no overt clues that one can grasp at, and name the person. If someone can, he or she must be a genius, and should immediately start writing mystery, because I only found slight clues about the werewolf's identity. This is a film that unfolds, and one needs to just enjoy the way nearly most of the supporting characters are accused, and not forgiven until the conclusion. The film does not want to engage our minds, but our hearts, It wants to tear at our heartbeats, making us fear for Valerie, and the people who are accused and tortured for having communication with or being the werewolf based on speculations.<br /><br />At the core of it, this film is not very memorable.  It reaches a conclusion without offending reason or its own narrative thread. It succeeds brilliantly at building tension between the characters, but when the werewolf must be revealed, it does not shock. Sure, it DOES surprise, but with a few narrative changes I could have successfully made anyone else the werewolf. The final incident of the film would have made excellent fodder for a sequel, but Director Catherine Hardwicke decides to patch up the film quickly. The film does not suffer because of this, but it could have become intersting if the filmmaker had dared a little more.<br /><br />I must admit that this was a fun film, whenever and wherever it's set. It's a must for Amanda Seyfried fan's who will be happy to know that she is maturing into a wonderful actress, possessing the same qualities that made and continues to make Meryl Streep a star. Even though it may not be entirely memorable, it benefits from a solid screenplay that, if nothing else, makes this a solid, enjoyable movie.fer because of this, but it could have become intersting if the filmmaker had dared a little more.

0439023521|5.0|I stumbled across this book by accident, I am not a Young Adult, but curiosity got me interested in this book and I decided to check it out. I gobbled this book up it days.<br /><br />The book takes place in an undisclosed point in the future, where North America, due to a series of wars and natural disasters has become a totalitarian country called Panem. The country ruled by the Capital is divided into twelve districts each district specializing in a special commodity. Each year the country stages a reality like show where each District sends one boy and one girl to the Capital where they fight to the death in a live to TV show called `The Hunger Games'.<br /><br />The story features a 16 year old girl by the name of Katniss Everdeen, who lives in District 12 which happens to be the poorest district in Panem. She's a tom boy who hunts wild animals and collects fruits/greens in order to feed both her family (her father has died) and to trade for money.  I like Katniss. She's not so perfect that she's threatening to female readers but on the other hand she's independent and self-reliant enough to appeal to boys. As the story goes on it becomes easy to see why she has so many male admirers.<br /><br />Katniss has a lot of street smarts but is a bit slow in other departments.  She's not outright dumb, but years of hardships and having to fend for her family has seemed to  have given her some low self-esteem. It seems to boggle her mind that anyone would like her or be kind to her. It's one of the things I loved about her and what made her so real.<br /><br />While there is nothing really original in this story, While the book is very similar to the Japanese book/anime/film `Battle Royale', Lord of the Flies and  New World Order. Suzanne Collins the author manages to tell the story as if it is something completely new. The world building is really phenomenal.  I also found the story to be organic.  An act of defiance at the end was more out of cammderie than some manufactured  `down with the man' type of rebellion. The violence didn't bother me, as this is a very harsh word and people behaved harshly.<br /><br />While teenage girls might be interested in the girl power story of Katniss or her triangle between the two male characters Gale and Peeta. I was more interested in the world of Panem, and made me wonder what North America would look like as a Totalitarian dictatorship. Most books/films about the future can't help but hearken back to the United States and it being a land of the free and therefore have the characters main aim to get things to be that way again.. But there are no such references in this book. Everything is new.  There are very few English (or even recognizable modern names). I also enjoyed how the mention of future scientific technology was kept to a minimum. It was easier for the reader to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />I also found it interesting that there was no references to religion, perhaps Collins didn't want to bring it up. But I assumed that any adherents to religion (ie. Christianity) would have been driven underground.<br /><br />At any rate, I would strongly recommend this book to people of all ages.an' type of rebellion.

0553386794|1.0|I started this series before the 4th book (Feast of Crows) was published, thinking that as long as the books are I would catch up with the publishing cycle and be okay.  I didn't know two important things: 1) GRRM is never going to actually finish the series because he is a long-winded pompous a$$ who loves his own phrasing and doesn't have a decent editor, and 2) the series is impossible to love because all the lovable characters get killed.  Now, I like dense plotting and I don't mind door-stopper books(I love Tad Williams!), and I also don't mind characters with both good and bad qualities, but I do expect some kind of hero to root for, some semblance of good winning, and some reason to keep going through a series.  GRRM seems hell-bent on ignoring the archetypes and tropes of good fantasy writing in favor of endless streams of words, sex, and sadism.  Every decent, heroic character is tortured beyond belief, either physically, mentally, or both, and then is killed.  Who do you root for?  Who comes out on top?  Why should I care?<br /><br />I read that he based the series on both the Hundred Years War and the War of the Roses.  Pick one!  That's over 150 years of English history, which is way too much to tackle, even in a looooonnnggg series like this one.  And while you're at it, Mr. Martin, pick a side!  Stand for England or France - not neither.  Be a Yorkist or a Lancasterite.  The fence-sitting element is at the heart of why there are no characters to cheer for or care about.  You can put your hero(es) through the ringer, but you have to have one, and we as readers need to know somewhere inside that they will eventually overcome.  Read Robin Hobb and/or Brent Weeks to see how this works.  Both of them can be a bit sadistic with their lead characters, but as a reader you know that eventually they'll triumph.  Without that, we are left with a dismal world where good people die, evil bitches and bastards prevail, and hope is dead.  If I wanted to dwell in that world, I'd just watch the real news.'d just watch the real news.
0439023491|2.0|This book is the sequel to the Hunger Games. Peeta and Katniss having survived the Hunger Games have returned to District 12. But their lives have changed forever. Their actions at the end of the Hunger Games have angered the Totalitarian Panem government , namely President Snow.. But they have also lit a flame under the various Districts who were initially itching to rebel. Most of the story  involves The Capital (the government) trying to quash the signs of rebellion, Katniss coming to the realization that the citizens of Panem are being grossly mistreated.<br /><br />I did not like this book all that much. It was interesting at first, but then it began to get needlessly bogged down. And has been noted before the book is almost a repeat of the Hunger Games. I haven't read `Mockingjay' yet.  But I really think that the author could have combined the essence of Catching Fire into THG and Mockingjay. Because most of what is in Catching Fire is really repetitive and superfluous.<br /><br />I would go so far as to say to future readers who have just finished THG that there is no need to read this book. You can get the gist of the story from reading and online synopsis  before going on to Mockingjay.
0800141601|5.0|DVD The First Knight with Richard Gere  An exceptional film. It shows action without the usual filthy words that are in so many current American movies with action, so wonderful. The villain is intelligent, provides clever action. Pagentry is spectacular. Hero carries himself well into conflict. Boy meets girl in an interesting way.     Purched this DVD at Amazon.com.

I use it at work for signing checks, and i can even use the UV light to check the legitimacy of a check that im cashing. i get tons of compliments on it from my customers. a must have for any serious fan of the series who doesn't want to go out and by the 300 dollar metal replica.
B000URWYTS|2.0|I blindly agreed to this book when it was suggested for my book club and expected the novel to be a romance.  I was unable to connect with Mamah's character and found the first five chapters to be dull.  Only two people in my club finished the sample and were willing to spend $12 on the novel.  By the end of the novel I felt tricked by the author.  She failed to deliver any romance and then blindsided me with the horrifying and devastating conclusion.

B00006BIO0|5.0|I ordered this not too long ago and it was worth it! Great deal and awesome songs. The grainy recording quality makes me feel like I'm in another time. Perfect traveling music if you're on the road by yourself. I didn't know that several Son House recordings were included. It also has the only four known recordings of Louise Johnson, which makes it even more awesome. I recommend this collection to anyone even if they don't listen to the blues..it should convert them.
0756404738|3.0|I enjoyed this , but not as much as \\"The Name of the Wind\\". The section where Kvothe and his band of merry men ( and woman) were hunting the bandits in the forest seemed to drag on a bit too long and I got tired of all the folklore / stories within the story. The lessons Kvothe learned from Tempi and later in Ademere were such an obvious knock off of Tai Chi and Tao I almost groaned. Despite this , I still cared about the characters, they were, for the most part believable. The story still held my interest and the writing continues to be very good , many memorable descriptive passages and a nice, easy flow. Maybe the third volume will be as good as the first , but even if it is only this good, that's good enough.
B003539QKO|4.0|If you're strictly into rap you might not like this, because a lot of the songs are mainly rock songs.  Track 12 is punk for example.  Weezy still raps at times and  this album has really grown on me.  If he wrote a lot of the songs and is really playing a main guitar track than I'm impressed.  He overuses auto-tune a little too much -- the effects are overbearing at times.  The first song is kind of weak but song #2 is strong and it takes off from there.  And I don't really think he needs so much auto-tune.  I like rappers that can sing the chorus of their long -- like Eninem does a lot.  It's ok to bring in another artist or some chick for a few tracks, but it's pathetic when you people only spit out half of their own \\"solo\\" album.  I like Lil' Wayne's past two CDs better than any of Tha Carter albums.  The last two have better top tracks, and focus on quality over quantity.  The track with Eminem on this album is pretty good too; not as good as the one on Slim's CD but it's still tight.  Check this CD out if you haven't yet.  It's not often I write a review, especially for a hip-hop album.  It takes balls to put out something this different; even if Carter has already made it in the music biz.  Keep staying original.
B004RUF9DC|4.0|This review is not about the film, but about the transfer to Blu-Ray disc. 5 stars for the film. 2 stars for the transfer. I love classic movies and I hate digital manipulation of the scanned film elements, like the sick degraining of most classic features. If the sometimes distracting noise other reviewers complained about, would be real film grain, I would be more than happy with that! But it is NOT grain, it is video noise and that's a shame for MGM/FOX. They simply recycled an old film to tape transfer and avoided the cost to perform a new state-of-the-art 4k scan of the best available elements. That's just it.
1556438850|3.0|It is Okay. Some chapters are really good but some topic it is different from one another in format lacking some info on the anatomy or asanas. I prefer ANATOMY OF HATHA YOGA or Yogabody: Anatomy, Kinesiology, and Asana or Vinyasa Krama Book by Srivatsa Ramaswamy.But I am not an expert so that is why I am reading and buy books so I keep on learning about this vast subject Yoga. I am pretty sure it is not a easy task to write a book that is going to make every one happy. That is why I gave 3 stars. It is worth the price and you may learn some thing that will open you practice or you mind !<br />Best wish for the author !
B00009V2ND|5.0|Even if this book would maybe not appeal to those not deeply in love with the Apollo Era, I found it very engaging and fascinating. Mr. Kranz found just the right balance between technicalities and personal anecdotes to tell the story of the unsung heroes of Mission Control. His first-hand account of key events like the first landing on the moon and the last days of the Apollo program brought literally tears to my eyes. A real treat to read.
0670022411|5.0|I truly hope the author writes a sequel.  This book was not at all what I expected. Description: intelligent, some suspense, page turner, dash of romance. If you are into paranormal, fantasy books this should be your favorite. PLEASE WRITE A SEQUEL.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|I wanted to really like this movie but the further I got into it the less I understood and the worse my headache got. From what I can tell it all revolved around aliens and them using us to do experiments/tests.  The scenes really jumped around, alot! It was hard to follow and at the end it left you wanting more of it to be explained, and wondering what else you could have done with hour and 90 minutes you just wasted watching this movie.
0385341679|4.0|Karen Moning is a phenomenal writer. She takes the world of fairy and shows its dark side with TEETH! I love her style and the way she makes you realize that these creatures are definitely NOT Tinkerbell. Do not read these books expecting fairy dust and wings, you will be sadly disappointed. These books pack PUNCH and Mikayla is a whole new heroine that keeps your heart pumping!     Not to mention that her relationship with Jericho Barrons is so steamy you just can't stop reading! My only disappointment came with her last book \\"ShadowFever\\" I felt that it was rushed and not done up to her original capacity. The book fell far short of what I was expecting and it virtually ruined the rest of the series for me. I have to say however, that I still would like to see more of her work and I can only hope it just gets better from here.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|We have just finished season 4 and are looking to purchase 5-7, i dont watch tv at all and only watch movies, i dont even know how i saw this series on dvd  and why i got it, OH it was at our local library, season 1... that did it. i am just totally blown away by how wonderful EVERY aspect of the series is and thrilled to get to see it. my mom has bought ALOT of british detective series sets and we have watched them all, once your used to british stuff its really a let down to see american stuff which seems so trite by comparison. medium is about as brit as it gets and EVERYONE on the show or behind the scene is SUPER on all levels.<br />I hope to be able to have a copy of the whole series too.<br />AnnMarie

B0000CABBW|3.0|Jennifer Duncan  The Whale Rider    Whale Rider review  The movie starts off with a girl speaking of a man that rode into the village on a whale. His son was to be the next chief but instead a girl was born and the twin boy died taking their mother. Her name was Paikea. She belonged to the Whangara people on the coast of New Zealand. Her grandfather resented her at first but then changed his mind as she got older. Her father was absent throughout her life because of the devastation of his losses. These people believe they are all descendents of the man that rode the whale to shore. They all rode the whale in.  As the movie continues and Pai's dad comes back he brings news that he found another woman and they are expecting a child. Her koro which is her grandfather is supposed to find a male leader to lead the tribe out of darkness and believed Pai's brother was the one. She leaves to live with her dad so her grandfather decides to get all the first born sons together to try and find a leader. As they leave for the airport Pai decides to stay. Her grandfather will not include her in the training to be a leader but her family does. While swimming she finds the emblem of the whale rider. When Pai calls for the whales they came but they were beached and dying. When the people could not save them Pai went out and rode the ancestors whale out and the rest of the living beached whales followed them back out to sea. When she comes back and lives she becomes the leader.    This movie relates to world religions because it is that of a primal religion. They have their own beliefs such as being brought by a whale and they do not wear shoes in most places. They have special ways of greeting each other and practice traditions in ancient languages. The people believe more in spiritual aspects and of the world around them rather than a god. They believe in a tradition.  They believe in ancestors watch over them and will be there for them.  They also chant and dance and pray.
0545265355|5.0|After reading the first two books of Suzanne Collins renowned series, \\"The Hunger Games\\" it is hard to find words to describe it that have not already been used. Stephen King said it best I think but I will give it a go. I pride myself on being a great lover of literature and have likely read everything I could get my hands on since I was old enough to realize what words were.    I must say that these novels have renewed my hope of finding writers that are not afraid to take risks with their characters. Suzanne Collins is a virtuoso in this area, she succeed profoundly in giving everyone, not just young adult readers, a novel to be proud of, one we can all cherish and I must say that these books will join the ranks of my favorites upon the same hallowed shelves that are home to \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", and others that I can never seem to find the ability to part with. This is not to say that she is a writer in the same vein, nor is it to say that these works are remotely anything close to what has been written by these esteemed authors. What I am trying to say is, these novels deserve to be placed with the same league as those classics we love so. There is so much emotion and devastation, elation and conquest in these books that to speak anything even remotely shallow about them would be a horrible injustice. I can only say to Suzanne as well as her fans that I hope she writes more and I fully intend to read anything she has written before or anything she may write after these wonderful books. She is a true asset to the literary field!
B004U42OD8|5.0|This album is a bit different from Panda Bear's last album, Person Pitch. The tracks are more distinct and divided, while the album itself has a more relaxing tone to it...<br /><br />The night I got it, I decided to listen to Tomboy while performing several activities to see where it took me. To start, I put it on while cooking dinner; and despite the laid back feeling this album carries, the music completely dominated my attention. I was repeatedly overcome with the need to dance in the kitchen. Thereafter, I decided to listen with a set of headphones, and this is by far the best way to hear Panda's new album. With headphones, the nuances of P. Bear's work really begin to emerge, immersing you in lush and sweeping soundscapes. Also great for meditation and sleeping like a babe...<br /><br />As always, Panda Bear has delivered all around musical goodness...

0205313426|5.0|Gangstalawya's one star and attack on this book merely illustrate his ignorance of what is involved in creativity.  Shakespeare and Lewis and others certainly took some creative liberties with the language, but they knew and observed the difference between an adjective and adverb, between an adjective and a demonstrative pronoun.  And they didn't use colons to set off the clauses of a compound sentence.  Only if you know the rules appreciated by intelligent and educated people, can you break them without breaking faith with your readers.<br /><br />All languages change over time, and a book almost a hundred years old will certainly raise some quibbles over usage, but some things, such as intelligent application of intelligent practice, never go out of date.  There is good reason why people enjoyed reading the New Yorker.  They weren't insulted by arrogant ignorance.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Most of us have heard of Bethany Hamilton, or at least of the surfer girl who lost her arm to a shark off the coast of Kauai. Fewer people know that she came from a Christian family, and that her faith played a huge part in her overcoming this obstacle and continuing on to become a national surf champion.<br /><br />\\"Soul Surfer\\" features Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as the parents, and AnnaSophia Robb (from \\"Bridge to Terebithia\\") does a great job in the role of Bethany. The film starts with some scenes establishing her family's faith and their playful fun together. All of them have surfing background and interest, and their lives on the Hawaiian Islands are portrayed in heartwarming ways that only add to the coming terror. The movie gives us some great surfing scenes, some beautiful photography, and when it reaches the moment of the shark attack, we are fully engaged. Although restrained in its showing of the violence, it captures the horrible feeling of loss, fear, and parental anxiety.<br /><br />Soon, Bethany is questioning God's plan in all this, since her surfing days could be over. She wonders how she'll ever find a guy who will love her with only one arm. And she watches her best friend be featured in Rip Curl promotions, while she stands on the sidelines and bravely supports her. She also struggles with media attention, not to mention the expected challenges of cutting oranges and putting on her own clothes. The special effects are well done, and we feel the anguish of not only Bethany, but of her parents as well. They are strong in their faith, but they are not perfect, and each member of the family has an issue to deal with, whether its the father's desire to push his daughter back into surfing, or the mother's desire to help her daughter accept her new physical appearance as one of true beauty. We also have Carrie Underwood playing the role of Bethany's youth pastor, there to offer hugs, love, advice, and a life-changing trip to Thailand after the devastating tsunami.<br /><br />For those who find any of this cheesy or too easy, they are missing the point. This is based on a true story. It's not pie-in-the-sky answers given in a fictitious setting, but the real-life struggles of the Hamiltons, and how God sustained them through some tough times. Bethany's own answers to the reporters are often word-for-word from actual interviews, where she gave impromptu responses. With even Roger Ebert giving this movie a good review, it's hard to imagine why some viewers seem to have an ax to grind with the faith element. While some movies are nothing more than sermons tacked onto a weak story, this is a strong story that would be inspiring even if it weren't Christian-based, but becomes that much more intriguing when rooted in biblical wisdom.<br /><br />This movie is well-acted, full of excitement, humor, and a number of emotionally stirring moments, when inspiration can be found in the human will to live and move on, and even more so in the solid faith that can sustain even the hardest of blows when a life, even a teenage girl's life, is surrendered to God. My own teen daughters loved this story, as did my wife. It's not only the best Christian movie I've seen, but one of the best sports movies I've seen. This is one wave I'm glad I caught early on.ating tsunami.<br /><br />For those who find any of this cheesy or too easy, they are missing the point. This is based on a true story.

0307593495|4.0|The mega-popularity of Stieg Larsson's \\"Girl Who...\\" trilogy has helped pique interest in Swedish mysteries.  Before there was Larsson, however, there was Henning Mankell, with his series of novels featuring detective Kurt Wallander.  Sadly, there will be no more Larsson books, but Mankell continues to write.  Nonetheless, his latest novel, The Troubled Man, is, according to very public statements by Mankell, the last Wallander book.  Does this mean Wallander will die or retire or get fired or maybe none of these?  Maybe Mankell has just gotten sick of the character.  There will be no spoilers from this review.    The title character is Hakan von Enke, the father of Wallander's daughter's fiancee.  Her future father-in-law is a retired naval officer who, as the story begins, is celebrating his 75th birthday.  During the party, he meets Wallander and the two bond as von Enke relates a decades old story of his encounter with a Russian submarine and the decision by higher ups to let it go.  Soon after that party, von Enke disappears.  Shortly after that, so does his wife.    Wallander is not directly involved, yet he does his own investigating and uncovers many von Enke family secrets.  Meanwhile, he has his own demons to deal with.  Some out-of-control drinking has put him in a situation where he faces punishment from his police bosses.  Various illnesses are assailing him and he is beginning to feel the effects of age (he is 60).  In many ways, it is Wallander himself who is the troubled man.  Despite his own problems, he still is an astute detective who can find many of the answers he seeks.    I knew by Mankell's statements that this would be the last Wallander book.  For me, however, it would be my first.  I'd only read one other Mankell book (The Man from Beijing) and found it to be just okay.  The Wallander series, however, had gotten a lot of high praise.  Personally, I found this book to be better than my previous experience, but still just an okay book.  I'msure many would disagree with me, but I just don't find Wallander to be that interesting of a character.  Maybe it's his mundaneness that makes him compelling to others, but for me, The Troubled Man is a decent mystery - well written and plotted - but nothing great enough to make it stand out from the field.
B004G6009U|4.0|I think it is a very good product and great money value for a Blu-ray and DVD-combo pack. However, just one thing is not that good, which is the volume level of the actual film in Blu-ray disc is a bit too low, I have to raise the volume to the max on my laptop to get a relatively ok volume to enjoy the video, but actually it is still not the best volume level result.
0375836675|5.0|I Am The Messenger   My independent reading was \\"I Am The Messenger\\" by Marcus Zusak.  The main character is Ed Kennedy who is a 19 year old taxicab driver, who lives in a rundown shack with his dog and plays cards and drink beer with his close friends.  Ed was at the bank one day and someone tried to rob the bank, and Ed helped to capture the robber.  After that he started to receive ace cards in the mail or delivered to him with names or addresses of people who needed help.  Ed was happy and determined to help others even though he didn't know who was sending the cards.   I chose this book after seeing the list of choices and reading the review, and since I haven't read a lot of books in recent years, I wanted a book that was fun and interesting.  Something that would keep me engaged and focused.  This was one of my two choices and I was selected in this group for this book.  My first impression of the book was that it was funny and an easy read.  Once I started, it had me in suspense as to what might happen next.  I thought in the beginning I could relate back to Ed as a 19 year old kid just working to get by, and not caring too much about anything.  But after finishing the book I don't think I would have the patience to do what he did.   I think the target audience for this book is High School Kids and older.  I think they would like this novel, since they could relate to Ed and his friends just hanging playing cards and drinking.  They could learn a lot from Ed as to how his life changed with each and every card message he received, the people he helped and the message it sends in the end.  On the other hand they might not like it as it took a lot of Ed free time away from Ed and his friends.  They might rather be drinking playing cards, or looking for girls, rather than hunting down people they don't know, or why they are doing it.   My favorite part of the book was when he got the ace of hearts, and he was to help his friends, since they were the ones that were close to him.  Ed wasn't close to his family and was anxious to see what kind of messages he had for his friends.  It was my favorite part since he found out his close friend had a child, whom he had never seen before, and Ed helped to arrange a meeting.  That is a situation you the readers can relate to, since we think we know everything about our friends, and maybe we don't.  Ed also found love for himself.  My least favorite part was when he went to the movie theatre and I thought he was going to get people to come to the theatre, but it was only to spend a little time with the old man.  The most satisfying part was when he confronted his mother on her porch, and she told him why she treated him that way.  She didn't treat him with respect and she didn't like him, because she wanted him to make something of himself, and she feared he was going to be like his father and not accomplish anything.  I think a lot of readers would relate to this as they are pushed by their parents to be better in life.  On the other hand the least satisfying part is that his brother doesn't get along with him.  He goes to university and looks down on Ed.   In the end this was a very entertaining novel.  The ending was great as Ed got the love of his life Audrey to love him back and move in with him.  He helped his friends and he found out who was sending the cards.  In the end he found out the real meaning of the card messages.  He wasn't a messenger.  He was the message.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Black Swan is trully a master piece. I'm not going to spoil anything so let me get straight to the point. When watching Black Swan keep your eyes out on the small things that go throughout the movie. Remember the story plott of the story of the White Swan. The story White Swan has many connections with the story plott of Black Swan. Also keep your eyes out on the the special effects such as Nina's (Natalie Portman) skin, and other phycological changes. The movie isn't a fully explained. I guess it's up to you to decide what truly happened. (-the movie is not recommended for those who have troubles understanding phycological movies. Movies such as: The Uninvited, Inception, and Shutter Island all fall into the catagory of phycological movies.)

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've never used a fitness DVD before. I started this DVD the day I got it in the mail through Amazon, and I've done it just about every single day for the past 3 weeks. I've lost 5 pounds doing nothing more than this DVD and just being a little more careful about what I eat.     I love that it's only 20 min of your day. Going to the gym used to be a 2 hour ordeal, trying to put together a somewhat decent looking workout outfit, driving to and from the gym, doing 45 min of cardio, and 30 min of weight training. Now, I literally just change into a sports bra and comfy underwear and do this in the privacy of my home and I'm done in 20 minutes.     There are 3 different levels, but while you're doing each level, you can follow Anita, who does modified easier versions of some of the exercises, or you can follow Natalie, who does the advanced version. So it's almost like there's 6 different workouts, not 3.     The workout literally works your entire body. It's amazing. I definitely notice changes in my body. I have been singing Jillian's praises since I got the DVD and 2 of my friends have also purchased this at my recommendation.     Totally getting attached to Jillian and Anita and Natalie (her 2 sidekicks).     Hope this helps. You NEED to get this, it's only 7.99 with no tax on here!
B000OONQ9O|4.0|Directed by Walter Hill<br />Starring Michael Beck, James Remar, David Patrick Kelly<br />93 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital Mono<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital Mono<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />The future is ours...if you can count.<br /><br />I have a small pile of unwatched Blu-rays, but last night I was in the mood for something I already knew. After much deliberation, I went with The Warriors.<br /><br />I like to analyze why I enjoy certain movies so that I can understand myself more, but this one is tricky.<br /><br />I know that I don't like watching violence or people getting beaten up, unless there's a point to it. I certainly don't think it's cool to watch a fight or someone being hurt. I have no fascination for gangs in general. The acting isn't up to much and dialogue is limited. I couldn't pick out a selection of scenes that were meaningful or memorable. So why do I enjoy watching this movie?<br /><br />I do like the setting. Released in 1979, it was intended to have a somewhat futuristic look. It still seems dated to me though.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes sets up the story so I don't think talking about it is much of a spoiler. The gangs are requested to attend a meeting by Cyrus, the leader of the biggest gang. Those attending are allowed to send nine members from their gang and weapons aren't allowed. Cyrus points out that members from rival gangs are standing together without anyone getting wasted. He also observes that there are 60,000 gang members in New York and only 20,000 police. Instead of fighting over a few yards of turf, the combined force could take over the city. That's an interesting idea. Unfortunately, gangs being what they are, one of the gang members (Kelly, Twin Peaks) hasn't obeyed the truce and shoots Cyrus, killing him. He points at the Warriors, claiming they did the shooting.<br /><br />So the nine gang members are surrounded by rival gangs, weaponless, fifty miles from home. Both the police and the rival gangs are after them. The story shows what happens when they try to make it back to their home turf. Nine innocent men on the run; Hitchcock would be proud.<br /><br />As I said, that's the first 15 minutes. The remainder of the story deals with the journey home. Will they all make it? Will any of them?<br /><br />The soundtrack adds something and a local radio station monitors the progress of the Warriors. The original music by Barry De Vorzon fits in well and makes the whole thing an atmospheric experience.<br /><br />Various encounters with other gangs and the police ensue. The gangs all have their own colors and way of doing things.<br /><br />It's such a simple story, but it works. It's become something of a cult classic over the years in the same way that Escape From New York has.<br /><br />I'm still not sure why I like it so much. Do I place myself in their position? Is it nostalgia for my childhood? Most of the characters are merely sketches, although some have a bit more depth. There are quiet periods where we just see the Warriors walking around, although the scenes are filled with tension because a threat could appear at any time.<br /><br />After all that, I'm still not sure.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? Sure. It's not what you would think just by looking at the title or the cover. If you can see it for free, it's worth checking out. Maybe you'll have the same reaction as me.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly good transfer for a movie of its age and limited budget. The sound quality is a little lacking, being just DD 5.1.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5s, fifty miles from home. Both the police and the rival gangs are after them. The story shows what happens when they try to make it back to their home turf. Nine innocent men on the run; Hitchcock would be proud.    As I said, that's the first 15 minutes.

Is it nostalgia for my childhood? Most of the characters are merely sketches, although some have a bit more depth. There are quiet periods where we just see the Warriors walking around, although the scenes are filled with tension because a threat could appear at any time.    After all that, I'm still not sure.    Would I recommend this? Sure. It's not what you would think just by looking at the title or the cover. If you can see it for free, it's worth checking out. Maybe you'll have the same reaction as me.    This is a surprisingly good transfer for a movie of its age and limited budget. The sound quality is a little lacking, being just DD 5.1.    Overall 4.5/5

B004INNRFK|2.0|This is, by far not my favorite of David Foster.   As a matter of fact, first 5 songs/artists I do not like at at all.  It does have a few gems on it but his first Hit man Cd is far better on the pieces chosen, my opinion only. the muscial arrangements are just fine.
0307593495|5.0|Mankell's Kurt Wallander is a wonderful police charachter . This is the best of all the Wallander books...in my opinion.  It is a page turner from start to finish .
B000K7UG34|5.0|I rented this disc from Redbox, because I thought it would make a nice movie for my brand new Bluray player.  What a movie!  While everyone talks about the video portion of Bluray, the sounds that are in this movie were amazing.  Of course, others have documented the fantastic storyline and photography.  All in all, the movie was a fantastic experience.  A well deserved, and rare, five!    I also thought the soundtrack was great, with a mixture of good sixties music, culminating with a beautiful hymn at the very end of the film sung by the US Military Academy Choir.  This movie was a big winner.    And thanks to the many Vietnam vets out there!  I appreciate your perspectives on this film.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Directed by Darren Aronofsky<br />Starring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder<br />108 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />With five Oscar nominations (cinematography, best picture, directing, editing and best actress), Black Swan took home the best actress statue for Natalie Portman. The $13 million budget meant that certain sacrifices had to be made, but the result is still a film of high quality.<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />Black Swan is a psychological drama along the lines of Psycho, rather than a film about dance. Nina (Portman) is a ballet dancer who wants the leading role in a new adaptation of Swan Lake. The role consists of two elements; the white swan and the black swan. She's apparently the best candidate for the role and performs the white swan better than anyone, but is encouraged to abandon her self control in order to access the emotions needed to dance the black swan role. In order to do so, she toughens up mentally, becomes more assertive and confrontational and explores her sexuality.<br /><br />Like Mulholland Dr. and Fight Club, the line between what is real and what is imagined is not obvious on first viewing. Nina is a disturbed young woman who has trouble staying grounded in reality. She imagines terrible things and obsesses about winning the role. Her duality is gradually revealed throughout the film and will frighten some people who allow themselves to become fully involved with the story.<br /><br />I won't spoil things further, but Black Swan is an interesting tale of Nina's search for perfection in her art.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are superb. The camera is frequently used to follow the dancers on stage and puts the viewer among the action. It's quite breathtaking in places. The editing and digital manipulation both convince the audience that Portman is performing all of the moves a ballet dancer might make.<br /><br />Shot partially in 16mm and also digitally, Black Swan lacks the level of detail normally associated with a modern Blu-ray presentation. Many of the scenes are dark, while others are stylistic and intentionally soft. Heavy grain is present, but the look is very similar to the theatrical presentation. This is not a poor transfer; it's an accurate reproduction of the film's original look. Don't expect to be blown away. This isn't Avatar.<br /><br />Portman trained for 10 months to learn how to move like a dancer. She also dieted so that her body fit the part. She fully deserved her Oscar nod for this performance. The supporting cast is strong in all areas, with her mother (Hershey), and her closest rival for the part of the swan queen, Lily (Kunis) both doing good work.<br /><br />The special features offer interviews with Aronofsky, Portman, Hershey, Cassel and Ryder. There's a 49-minute featurette on how the film was made, including the music, cinematography and special effects. Well worth a look if you're a fan.<br /><br />Black Swan draws you into its world. If you let it happen, you will be affected emotionally. The score enhances the experience considerably and the whole package is pleasing. It was one of the best five films of 2010.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5vince the audience that Portman is performing all of the moves a ballet dancer might make.

B00000IFWE|3.0|The music is fantastic, I like all of the songs. The reason for three stars: If you try to rip the music to add the songs to an I-pod or if you wanted to make a personal copy to prevent damage to the origanal or if you like to edit the songs by ripping the CD, forget it, the music comes out staticy throughout all of the songs, (probably anti-theft in the CD). I haven't tryed to put the songs into the I-tunes library to play on an I-pod, maybe that will work, I won't be able to take out f-words or repetative phrases. The CD plays perfect on a player, just be aware of this hidden goodie that comes with this CD.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I had this CD when it was in album format years ago and currently do not have a turntable to play it on so I was so happy to finally get this in CD. What can I say about this absolute classic, must have collection of insighful, way-ahead-of-their-time songs. They make me want to hollow with sadness over the plight of the world, yet at the same time, the tunes are so well put together, I feel elated and inspired when I hear them. Just simply a masterpiece which will never go out of style!!!!!

B002FE5XVK|5.0|Stop Making Sense<br />Directed by Jonathan Demme<br />88 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (audience mix)<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (studio mix)<br />English: LPCM 2.0<br /><br />I was passionate about music long before I became passionate about film. It began when my neighbor played Hunky Dory to me, and became stronger through school as I discovered the likes of Pink Floyd, Neil Young, Joy Division, The Fall and too many punk bands to mention. We shared albums on cassette and I started listening to the John Peel show on the radio. He broadened my appreciation for obscure music. I mention this because Talking Heads were a big part of my musical education. I remember playing Fear of Music to death when it came out.<br /><br />David Byrne is not a conventional singer. In fact, very few of the bands I love have people who can really sing. It's just not a requirement for me. I prefer vocalists who obviously feel what they are performing, even if their vocal ability is limited. A list of my favorites would include:<br /><br />Ian Curtis - Joy Division<br />Neil Young<br />Stephen Malkmus - Pavement (can't even stay in the same key)<br />Black Francis - Pixies<br />Tom Verlaine - Television<br />David Bowie<br />Kristin Hersh - Throwing Muses<br />Polly Harvey<br />Nick Cave<br />Thurston Moore/Kim Gordon/Lee Ranaldo - Sonic Youth<br />Kurt Cobain - Nirvana<br />Jonathan Richman - The Modern Lovers<br />Mark E. Smith - The Fall<br /><br />Byrne whines, growls, yelps and screams. It works...for me. It may not work for everyone. The same goes for most people on the above list. That's why all those bands, and Talking Heads, don't sound like anyone else. They have their own identity. It amazes me that bands like Television don't get more recognition. Marquee Moon (arguably the best album of the 70s) is an absolute masterpiece of guitar sound, but they were labeled as punk/new wave and never got the recognition they deserve. I'm one of their 17 fans across the world.<br /><br />Talking Heads deserve a special place in music history and the band was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Their sound isn't exactly rock, but what is it? There's a huge funk influence as well as world music.<br /><br />The rhythm section was superb with Chris Frantz (drums), Jerry Harrison (guitar, keyboards) and Tina Weymouth (bass) all vital to the mix. For the purposes of this film, the band was joined by Bernie Worrell (keyboards), Steve Scales (percussion), Alex Weir (guitar), Edna Holt (backing vocals) and Lynn Mabry (backing vocals). The result was an intricate fusion of styles with multiple layers of sound. This complicated layering is prevalent among bands I have grown to love over the years.<br /><br />The movie doesn't look like a movie at all; it looks like a live concert. It was filmed over several nights with cameras being positioned in different places each time. As a result, you won't see cameras cluttering the performance. It explains how we were given views of the audience from behind the drums without any other cameras in view. The shooting style is somewhat similar to that used in the dance scenes in Black Swan. You'll find yourself on stage with the band, right among the action.<br /><br />The concert begins with David Byrne walking out carrying a boom box. He wants to play us a tape. It consists of the pounding backing beat of Psycho Killer and he performs it solo with his guitar. Tina Weymouth joins him for a rendition of Heaven, with Chris Frantz entering for Thank You For Sending Me An Angel and Jerry Harrison completing the foursome on Found A Job. The guest performers all add something to the sound and all nine performers are on stage for the start of the seventh song. I have seen Byrne use this formula for solo shows and it works well. I think it highlights what each musician adds to the sound and helps you appreciate exactly how much is going on in that rhythm section.<br /><br />Byrne was a ball of energy, running on the spot, doing laps around the stage, leaping up beside the drums and performing a variety of patented moves. When the ensemble plays the Tom Tom Club's Genius of Love, Byrne leaves the stage. When it ends, he returns wearing the big suit. He wanted to make his head look smaller so he decided to make the rest of his body appear bigger. I think Byrne was one of the best front men in music history. Looking like a cross between a manic bird and Norman Bates, he was never still.<br /><br />One of the gripes I have about popular music is that it's too manufactured. The record labels want a product that can be marketed and exploited. As long as those involved look the part, the music is secondary. That's not the case with Talking Heads. This was real. Look at their faces and how much they enjoyed the performance. Look at the effort involved.<br /><br />The music is full of emotion.<br /><br />There are 16 songs included in the 88 minutes:<br /><br />1. Psycho Killer<br />2. Heaven<br />3. Thank You For Sending Me An Angel<br />4. Found A Job<br />5. Slippery People<br />6. Burning Down The House<br />7. Life During Wartime<br />8. Making Flippy Floppy<br />9. Swamp<br />10. What A Day That Was<br />11. This Must Be The Place (Naïve Melody)<br />12. Once In A Lifetime<br />13. Genius Of Love<br />14. Girlfriend Is Better<br />15. Take Me To The River<br />16. Crosseyed And Painless<br /><br />No weak tracks there. It's not quite the perfect set, but it's close. Don't Worry About the Government would have been a nice addition. The bonus features do include Cities and Big Business/I Zimbra, adding another 11 minutes or so of music.<br /><br />Talking of special features, there's also a 65-minute press conference of the band at a 1999 film festival where the movie was shown for its 15th anniversary.<br /><br />Can I recommend this to everyone? No, definitely not. It depends what kind of music you like. If all you have ever listened to is classic rock and AOR, the jump might be too much for you. If you are familiar with Talking Heads and appreciate what they do, the Blu-ray is an essential purchase. That said, you'll be disappointed by the picture quality. It's marred by frequent dirt, scratches and white specks. Concerts tend to happen in dim settings and you have to remember that it's 27 years old. I would rate the picture quality 3/5.<br /><br />The real difference here is the sound. There are three lossless mixes. The audience mix (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), the studio mix (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) and a PCM stereo mix. There are occasional sync issues, such as on Life During Wartime, but overall, things match up well. The audience mix gives more of a concert experience while the studio mix is more polished. Both are excellent.<br /><br />I quickly forgot the shortcomings of the picture quality and enjoyed the music.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5s around the stage, leaping up beside the drums and performing a variety of patented moves.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I love Liza Manelli in this.  Her character was spunky and at times spazzy but fascinating to watch.  The musical numbers were powerful and theatrical which makes for an entertaining show.  The story was interesting and multi-dimentional, each character had a story and the performances were totally believable.  It's nice to know Liza Manelli won the oscar for best actress, she did an amazing job.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a dark and disjointed movie, hard to follow and difficult to get back on track after a break.  Understandably, we are moving toward a final showdown, but this is a peacemeal come-on to lock the customer into buying the sequel.  This is the first, really disappointing Harry Potter movie I have seen.
B003UESJHE|5.0|The King's Speech<br />Cast: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi<br />Director: Tom Hooper<br />Starz/Anchor Bay   2010   118 min   Rated R   Apr 19, 2011<br /><br />Video<br />M-PEG4 AVC   1080p   1.78:1<br /><br />Audio<br />English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Discs<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Movie 5/5<br />Have you ever been involved in public speaking? Even a small audience can be enough to take you out of your comfort zone. Imagine that you stammer and you're required to speak live to more than a quarter of the Earth's population. Throw in the fact that your audience is frightened due to the impending war against Hitler's Germany. A confident, optimistic and inspirational speech is essential.<br /><br />That's the situation King George VI found himself in.<br /><br />Historical dramas generally bore me. I'm not particularly interested in the royal family, despite living in the UK for the first 43 years of my life, and have no love for them at all. But for some reason, this works.<br /><br />Tom Hooper directed the excellent The Damned United, but this is even better. He chose to shoot most of the film in dark rooms rather than focus on the potential splendor offered by Buckingham Palace. Apart from a scene inside Westminster Abbey, most of the rooms are drab. The story is character-driven and works because of the acting rather than the setting.<br /><br />Colin Firth gives a brilliant performance as King George VI, although he isn't king when the film begins; he's the Duke of York. We see him stumble over an early speech in the 1920s and his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Carter), seeks a speech therapist to help him overcome his impediment.<br /><br />Doesn't that sound boring?<br /><br />She finds Lionel Logue (Rush) who has a practice in London's famous Harley Street and forces her husband to see him. Rush is great as the Australian therapist and supplies much of the humor in the film. The two initially enter into a doctor/patient relationship and eventually become friends.<br /><br />If I had read that premise without knowing anything else about the story, there's no way you could have convinced me I would care about the characters or the outcome. But the quality of the acting overcomes all that and I did end up caring about a historical speech delivered by a monarch in whom I had zero interest. That says something about the power of this film.<br /><br />Fans of the Harry Potter movies will be familiar with Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall and Helena Bonham Carter. It's interesting to see them here in serious roles.<br /><br />The driving force of the story is the friendship between Logue and the future king. Indeed, Logue insists that the two function as equals and calls the Duke Bertie. He apparently has little respect for the monarchy and makes fun of it throughout. Strangely, I'm reminded of The Shawshank Redemption. The two main characters are in a difficult situation and yet manage to form an unlikely friendship, with each sustaining the other.<br /><br />We are shown early attempts by renowned physicians to cure the Duke's stammer, but no progress is made. The Duke's wife finds Logue and arranges an appointment. Logue's methods are unconventional to say the least and provide some of the film's humor. It's a big step for the Duke to trust this irreverent foreigner and relax enough to make progress.<br /><br />If you allow yourself to be drawn into the story, a peculiar thing happens. Rather than focusing on Firth's technique for stammering, you will start to think about the man he's portraying. There are scenes showing how he behaves when he's alone with his wife and his two little girls, and how they accept him for who he is.<br /><br />Firth's portrayal isn't over the top. He's a reserved man who isn't used to speaking up for himself. Over the course of the story, we see him grow. He finds that he has a voice.<br /><br />The R-rating is for language and it absolutely has to be there for the story to work so effectively.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are superb. The sets, costumes, casting, sound and pacing are close to perfect. It won four Oscars: Best picture, best director (Hooper), actor in a leading role (Firth) and original screenplay (David Seidler). During his acceptance speech, Seidler revealed that he used to stammer. That explains why he was able to portray that fear so well.<br /><br />The film won't appeal to everyone. It succeeds because of the dialogue and the strength of the story. There's no action and very little romance. If you like human interest stories, give it a try. It's among the best in that category.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />The video presentation isn't spectacular. The color palette is faded and wintry, filled with grays and blacks. There's occasional noise, such as in the dark shots taken in Logue's elevator. Detail is inconsistent, but strong in places. Most of these appear to be the intended look of the film, but it's slightly disappointing overall.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The sound does exactly what it's supposed to do. There are a few instances of crowd noise and background sounds in the streets of London, but this is a film rich in dialogue. It comes across as clear and even throughout.<br /><br />Special Features 3.5/5<br />The features appear sparse, but what's present is certainly worth checking out. I would be interested in a more comprehensive package in the future.<br /><br />Director Tom Hooper's audio commentary is extremely informative.<br /><br />There's a 23-minute feature with cast and crew detailing the making of the film.<br /><br />A 22-minute Q&A session with Hooper, Firth, Carter, Pearce and Claire Bloom seems to end all too quickly.<br /><br />Two speeches from the real King George VI show exactly what Firth achieved. As well as the stutter, Firth had to incorporate a slight impediment when using the letter R. One of the speeches appears at the end of the film, so you can see just how accurate Firth's portrayal was.<br /><br />The real Lionel Logue is a 10-minute feature with his grandson Mark.

B003UESJH4|2.0|I felt a disconnect with Colin Firth's character so I couldn't fully get into this film.  I'm sorry, I just don't have the patience or time to deal with people who stutter.  It's annoying and I feel that they should just not try to speak, they should just write things down on paper.  This film lost me half way through and I noticed I began zoning out and just staring blankly at the tv screen.  The strange thing is I usually love British films like Howard's End, Wings of the Dove and Sense and Sensibility.  I think I indentify with female lead roles rather than a male lead.  Helena Bonham Carter was barely in the movie, she had such a small thankless role.  I'm surprised she was nominated for an oscar, she's had much better parts in other films. I also didn't like Geoffery Rush's character, he was too fruity for me and came across like a total closet queen. As far as the best picture win,  I think Black Swan should have won the oscar for best picture.  About the only thing I liked about The King's Speech was the cinematography.  The sets were beautiful and I did enjoy the aestetics and the art direction.  Overall I did not find this film entertaining.
