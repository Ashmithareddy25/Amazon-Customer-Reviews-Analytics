B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book is beautifully written, simple in a way that allows you to relate to courageous Pi, yet clearly shows his remarkable wit and resourcefulness through smartly written lines. Perhaps my favorite part is the wonder it brings about, allowing readers to imagine what happened to Pi in the Times that are only summarized, and in the peculiar ending. It prompts its reader to think hard on their own situation, contemplating what is most important and what they would indeed risk their own life for.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What can I say, it's by Ken Follett, it's subject is interesting, it's huge so you can get lost in it for a while...get it!
B007ZM9I1I|4.0|Seriously, what's not to like, if you don't like monopoly or sourth park you wouldn't be buying this or reading the review anyway.  The came came in well protected, and still sealed couldn't be happier.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is a nice little weather app. The beautifully animated backgrounds are a nice touch. The interface is simple and elegant and works quite well. I can certainly recommend it.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's a great remake of the old game pandemic and a really low price compared to google plays price . It's well worth the 1$
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The plot twists were surprising and exciting. The characters were different and I loved that the female protagonist avoided most writing cliches. The first time I read this author, have now read 2 of her other books (that are also good).
B003L77GRO|5.0|My daughter and I love to watch movies and this was a good addition to our collection. Came on time and would recommend it
B007STBUIW|5.0|Bought this for my wife for a Christmas present and we watched it last night.  All I can say is WOW!  The colors are extremely vibrant and in your face gorgeous!  We watched the Blu-ray only so far and haven't watched any of the extras but I have to say that watching it on Blu-ray was like watching Jaws for the first time.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|This movie seemed more about the rise and fall of a tormented, twisted, and evil villain who desired immortality at any cost - and an unsuspecting heroine princess who gets lucky every time she turns around as if fate is paving the way to destined victory despite the obstacles. The villain carries out continued destruction of others lives in order to perpetuate her own. We need someone really bad to hate, so when goodness triumphs, we feel a deep sense of gratification - and now satisfied, we can move on with a calm sense that right will ultimately win out in every situation no matter how dark and desolate things may become.

0792844793|2.0|The movie came on time, but it has to be the worst movie in history! That is not the sellers fault it is just a horrible movie and I would never recommend it to anyone.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|I absolutely love this app on my HTC One S. But on my Kindle Frie HD? Terrible. It's sad, because this is one of my favorite apps. But until the app stops force closing, I can't watch any anime. And force close it does...every 15-30 seconds! Until a fix arrives, I can only give one star.<br /><br />Note: the H/W Decoder works, sometimes. S/W Decoder does not.

0553801473|5.0|Great read and super exciting. Definitely my favorite of the series so far. It seems impossible that GRRM will finish the story in the next 2 books but here's to hoping. I was so anxious to know what happened that I read this book in 3 sittings and lost a few nights of sleep. Totally worth it. The only bad part is waiting for the next one. I started the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan because I was going through Game of Thrones withdrawal. It is not as good, but seems to do the trick.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was entertaining but a weaker script than others. It views like a gigantic trailer for future franchise. I liked it just not as much as i wanted to.

B00AA7O22U|1.0|o.k. i know the big names here transformed this genre, but do they now have to kill it also? These guys have crags and fissures on their faces bigger than anything they've ever had to jump across. Sorry but,half this cast needs to take our money and run and segue in other genres of film. Yikes, but then where would the old FX guys that hang on go?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good middle command copycat. Would like more upgrades. Cluster bombs, temporary iron shield, satellite middle defense and heat seekers come to mind.

Be aware that there are many words and situations that are totally inappropriate for kids (and even for some of us adults).  It is for this reason I cannot give this movie more than two stars.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|GREAT game! I've been hooked since I got it. The puzzles get harder, but pacing is perfect. There isn't a sudden jump in difficulty. Easy to pick up & play, hard to put down. Definitely a must-have!
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn's book &#34;Dark Places&#34; was my second attempt on reading one of Ms. Flynn's books...I had attempted first with &#34;Lost Girl&#34; which I had a diffucult time getting into, so I thought maybe I just need to try another one of her books.  &#34;Dark Places&#34; had to hooked as soon as I started, it went from time line 1985 - present on all the characters, took turns I would of never expected, I would recommend this book, currently, I am reading &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;, I started yesterday, it's very hard to put down.  Now to all of you who have read &#34;lost girl&#34;, I owe it to myself to give it another try.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|This DVD only featured 1 concert out of God Only Knows how many they performed on this tour. I was at their concert at Stateline, Nevada (aka - Lake Tahoe). The gentleman sitting behind me told me it was his 5th concert. He had been traveling all over the country attending their 50th Anniversary concerts. After the concert in Tahoe was over he said it was the best out of all he had seen. There is absolutely no footage of that concert even though it was quite obvious it was being filmed. If you are going to take the time and effort to film more than one concert - for Pete's sake put it on the damn DVD!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Why do negative people always have so much negative stuff to talk about.  Why do positive people seem to have so much positive stuff happen to them.  How do we access the promises God made in the Bible.  How do some people with only sheer determination that they will do something make it happen.  Now it makes sense.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm a fan of solitaire, but this is much more challenging than the traditional game without being overly frustrating. Keeps me coming back!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will say that this book is probably one of the more intense emotional roller coaster rides I have read.  It was so beautifully written that I didn't stop reading until 1:45am.  The story line completely had me consumed and kept me guessing.  I loved Dean and Sky so much!  They were a perfect match!  I don't write reviews very often, but when I do it's because I LOVED the book.  This is one of my favorites!  Well done Colleen Hoover!!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I won't go too much into the things other reviewers have already touched on, such as the story, job-system, etc., but I'd like to point a few things out I haven't seen mentioned.<br /><br />We're talking a real Square-Enix gem here, so the crisp 3D graphics are no surprise, same with the lovely music.  It's easy to look at and listen to for hours and hours.  My only complaint concerning the games graphics is the homely little \\"analog stick\\" that appears onscreen whenever you prompt the avatar to move (meant to indicate which direction you're going).  I've scoured the game's configuration options, but sadly I haven't yet found a way to be rid of the thing.  If the controls were more reliable (more on that shortly), you wouldn't need anything onscreen showing you where you're headed.  Others have done this right, Square.  Just sayin'.<br /><br />So, it's important to note how the game is controlled on this device (in my case, a Kindle Fire).  Obviously, upon starting, the screen sets to a horizontal position, and of course everything is controlled via touch from then on out.  This touch control is just good - no more, no less.  It leaves a good deal to be desired.  It's far from ideal in the game's more precise situations, like maneuvering through narrow dungeon corridors, or turning tight corners.  And it can be a right pain when piloting the touchy air ship.  Other than that, the touch control isn't really put to much use - there's this maneuver you do to zoom in/ out of the action by stroking the screen with two fingers, but that's easy enough to learn.<br /><br />That's about it.  Pretty much covers all I wanted to say.  I would like to point out the game is actually pretty nice to my Kindle's battery, considering how high-res it is compared to most games.  And oh yeah, saving, quicksaving, and loading are just as ideal as they'd be on a console or something.  Hope all this helped.<br /><br />Ahem, one more thing: to anyone who turns their nose up at the price - remember you're not getting a silly little puzzle game, glitchy mobile \\"MMORPG\\", or some lamestream garbage that has you launching avians at a brick wall:  this is an epic, full-scale Final Fantasy game.  And a darn good one to boot.  This very same game could easily cost you thirty or so dollars at a game store.  So, well worth it, a real lot of bang for your buck.

B000QK90CI|5.0|Even if you don't like motorcycles, this movie will keep your interest. This movie covers many aspects of motorcycling riding, but also introduces the riders themselves. I will never tire of watching this film.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a critical book for those who want to re-take control of their lives.  It was recommended to me by my new therapist, for which I am grateful.  The book is easy to read as content is based on real-life questions from others.  It is appropriate for anything a person could be seeking: relaxation, relief from physical or emotional pain, and has many examples of how to live a simple life.  It gives the reader the control to use as you want, and not depend on medicines for the rest of your life.<br />I highly recommend this book for everyone.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Throughout the whole movie I was feeling as if I was waiting for it to start.... Well at least the action for it to start.... I did not understand what enas going on, or the hung with that pills till I think way later in the film.. shame
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Thought it was going to be much funnier than it was. Funny parts, just an ok movie. Wouldn't watch again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a simple and easy read with a twist. Both characters were flawed but in a remarkable way that made u love them. Good plot that moved fluidly and love scenes that were more tame than I expected, but seemed to fit the nature of this book. GREAT for a free read! Recommended for any true romantic at heart. Hope to read more from this author!

B0097AQEOK|4.0|But the flimsy packaging keeps it from a solid  5 stars.<br />It's a great deal- I got my set for  $35 so at  $3.50 per disc you can't go wrong.<br />The outer box is nice but the mini album sleeves are kinda cheesy.<br />I have several box sets that borrow the 'mini lp'  idea and this is the worse of the bunch.<br />All the cds come in thin cardboard gatefold mini lp replicas- even though I don't recall all the original<br />album jackets looking like this.<br />If you want to get all her cds from this period cheap- then you can't go wrong.<br />The packaging could be alot better, but it also could be alot worse.<br />It is what it is.

0345803507|1.0|Its like one of those movies you hear really good news about...and then when you go see it...its a disappointment. I didn't read it...my wife did. Too much unnecessary garbage at the beginning. You can have a &#34;love&#34; story without the smut...or even if there is...without the amount. Just seemed like they were filling in for pages more than anything.

B009O07NBQ|3.0|It was a dream to see that Howard Shore would be returning to grace the Tolkein franchise with his beautiful work, but when I took to the theater that fateful opening day, my ears were not as excited to hear his sound as I would have hoped. I think perhaps this is simply due to the fact that I am comparing The Hobbit with the previous Lord of the Rings masterpieces. As a standalone, The Hobbit soundtrack is dramatic where it needs to be, endearing when it wants, and sometimes even mystical - which all makes for a beautiful background atmosphere that ties effortlessly in with the same sound as the previous movies.<br /><br />But at no point was I \\"swept away\\" by the music here, as I am when I watch Lord of the Rings, or listen to the music from those three prior films. Is it simply because The Hobbit is not as heavy a story as the Lord of the Rings, or is something actually missing from the music? I would have liked to hear less of the \\"thrilling\\" choruses and more of the whimsical, fairy-tale hymns with this soundtrack, but then again, I feel that Peter Jackson's The Hobbit is suffering from Lord of the Rings envy. Seeing as how this is only the first of three, I will be looking  forward to Howard's take on the next two installments of this enchanting tale.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|It only loads the first few recent stories for me, unless I just don't know how to work it properly. It also acts funny when I try to &#34;like&#34; something.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never been one for books revolving around great horror. And, I suppose, one COULD argue that this was exactly that.<br /><br />However, the romance and the suspense formed a counterbalance which changed the book into a story of the ferocity of trying not only to survive, but to persevere and keep sane. I have never once encountered a book that has been able to weave these elements together so artfully.<br /><br />My compliments to the wordsmith that created this masterpiece. Congratulations, Ms. Suzanne Collins, and I cannot wait to read more from you!

B009MF5BXK|5.0|WOW!! A veritable collection of super stars are in this one.  Jet Li only has a small part this time, but both Arnold Schwargenegger and Bruce Willis had a bit more lines in this one than before. Jean Claude VanDamme is the bad guy in this movie and that was a little hard to take.  Chuck Norris even had a part in this movie.  L. Hemsworth also had a role in this movie.  The best line of the movie came at the end when Sylvester Stallone was looking at an old plane and said \\"That thing belongs in a museum\\" and Arnold answers back \\"We all do!\\"  Once the action gets going it is non stop until the end.  Hope there are more to come.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables 2012 has to be the most extremely riveting film adaptation of the most revered Broadway shows and novels to be produced thus far.  With an all-star ensemble cast, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sascha Cohen, Director Tom Hooper (\\"The King's Speech\\") has recreated the classic semi-operatic musical including its most trademark songs \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" \\"Who Am I\\" and \\"One Day More.\\"  When first glancing at the first few musical numbers, one may not help but to compare this film to other musicals that have been set onto film, \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"The Wiz,\\" or \\"Chicago.\\"  But if one delves into the genre even deeper, the film may also have parallels to movie musicals, such as \\"Oliver,\\" \\"Tommy,\\" or \\"Moulin Rouge\\" because the actors are actually singing out their lines within the film that fittingly is well done.  However, a line is drawn, especially with this version of Les Miserables that specifically stands alone from the rest and outshines as well.<br /><br />The film contains an intense depiction of each of the main characters with fierce dramatic emotion and romance.  But the undeniable highlight of the film is the music itself that is performed by the actors that display their musical dexterity and experience that may most likely move the viewer; a reminder that music can easily translate to various interpretations especially if it is carefully selected and exceptionally played.  And within the first hour of the film, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway) are pure examples of how music may move an individual as well as the rest of the actors that are playing their part in exemplifying the major themes expressed within the storyline and the film; it is a storyline the weaves a tale of characters longing for a purpose that leads each into situations that tests their souls and progresses within almost a ten year span that begins with Jean Valjean and Fantine and the introduction of Fantine's daughter Cossette (younger Isabelle Allen and older Amanda Seyfried) that show the power and struggle of secrets buried and eventual truths foretold within a historic backdrop that takes place in France during a time of oppression and revolution of the mid-nineteenth century.  It is an epic film of cinematographic proportions from the hilly and coastal cloistered landscape to the dingy cityscape of bottom dwellers Monsieur (Sascha Cohen) and Madame Thenadier (Helena Bonham Carter) and antagonists such as Constable Javert (Russell Crowe) and romantics Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Eponine (Samantha Barks) attempting to survive that looks a little like a Dickens novel of Tales of Two Cities that ring out the lines of \\"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\"  However, that quote was not even mentioned in the film but as one may watch, it connotes that thought in mind.  But aside from the parallels, the costumes and swagger of each of the actors bring the period alive.<br /><br />Les Miserables and its entire cast and crew are well deserving of all of the accolades and standing performances or at least hand claps at the end of the film.  They have shown that the sheer beauty of song and Victor Hugo's story has left a lasting impression upon audiences, and most importantly through music.ion of Fantine's daughter Cossette (younger Isabelle Allen and older Amanda Seyfried) that show the power and struggle of secrets buried and eventual truths foretold within a historic backdrop that takes place in France during a time of oppression and revolution of the mid-nineteenth century.

B00ADYYBFI|5.0|My wife and I both really enjoy the TV show and have really loved the music coming out of it. We were very surprised when we learned that the cast sings their own songs too.  I had already purchased some of the songs as they became available when the show became a hit so I wasn't upset as others have been about the song &#34;Fade into You&#34; not being in this collection, but it is labeled as &#34;Volume 1&#34; so with the success I'm sure there will be others.<br />My biggest gripe would be that most, if not all of the songs released are NOT the versions played on the show. And that's too bad as we feel that the songs we liked as played on the show often sounded better than these. So, it could be better but it's still very good!! And maybe the producers will listen to the fans that are buying the music for Volume 2 !
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I loved it because the story was about man's ultimate quest rather than mistreating indigenous people. I was pleased to see that in 2089 old white men could still become wealthy, the war against infidels did not succeed, Christmas was still a recognized holiday, but races were still distinct.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|you will love this album. words cant express how great this album is. and if you got it during the sale it was only 99 cents.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I like Mahjong, but set up differently.  I think they call basic or standard layout.  I don't want all the configurations & I certainly don't want 3 games all going at once in my face.  Sorry.  I do like the game, however, just not this particular one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The lightning thief is one of the best books I have ever read. And trust me, I am a very picky person.
076535618X|5.0|I am busy and rarely read fiction, only doing so to find the occasional escape from reality provided by a good read. The trio of books culminating with \\"The Last Colony\\" was particularly enjoyable. Each book was unique and neither got caught in the trap of rehashing the story from the previous installment or built toward a myopic theme.<br /><br />This installment to the series reminded me early of Monica Hughes' \\"Invitation to the Game\\". Americans have had a fixation with the idea of the frontier and seeking to move from occupied places to lands of new bounty. Like \\"Invitation to the Game\\", people of wasted land were seeking to seeded on lands of new bounty and, initially, doing so without the technology that has caused a weakening of the citizenry.<br /><br />Unlike Hughes' exciting work from my youth, Scalzi takes the theme of the frontiersmen and turns it back to an enlightenment of the villager. The wandering ascetic returns home to offer enlightenment to those left in the dark. Like the hero another work from my youth, \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" by Hermann Hesse, John Perry, the main character, transcends by overcoming a desire for security, fame and power while fulfilling the needs of his family and his people. Like Prometheus, John Perry offers fire to the people denied on his home world, Earth.<br /><br />John Scalzi has a remarkable ability to write science fiction in the old school belief that only one or two rules of accepted reality should be altered to enable the writer to achieve the story. At the same time, Scalzi avoids the trap of too closely mimicking the monomyth, writing a story with character development that does not feel contrived. This, likewise, helps him to achieve his goal of making science fiction accessible. His style is easy. His characters are appealing, multidimensional, and his plot is not forced. I look forward to reading more of his novels.
B002CNST10|5.0|Muse has always been the best band. I can't vouch for their newer albums but this album encapsulates the very best of muse!
B00062PN6I|5.0|I wish if the sound quality is much louder or may be I am deaf, the sounds is great and works like a charm, but I think the problem is with my Laptop not the Headphones ! Loved it
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I have to make an exception tonight.  This story was spectacular, the characters were engaging, believable, well thought out.  I loved the dialogue, the romance, the steamy scenes. I loved the cover design too because I am one of those people who enjoy looking at the cover at key points throughout the story.  I am definitely going to read as many books by this author as I can find and I am now a fan of the KISS series.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Excellent movie and bought for my husband as part of his Xmas Gifts.  It was well packaged.  He has not yet played it.  We had seen this movie in the theater.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Very exciting. Love Sam & Dean. Kept me in suspense. Very shocking ending. Love this whole series. It is worth buying all 7 seasons. Can't wait for season 8 to be available .
B000068TPN|4.0|This a great, thought provoking, inspiring movie. It is graphic at times but it is portraying true events. It's one that goes in my movie library.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|My favorite Boheme. Now I can watch it whenever I wish. You could not ask for better.<br />I think the 25-year old James Morris was the inspiration for the Geico caveman.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is writing more like he did in the beginning....back to his good writing roots...I am glad he's back.
B000094HMU|5.0|Domingo and Marton at their best. There really is no one singing Turandot who can match them. The colors are a bit murky so that the marvelous production does not meet the standards of the HD DVD. But, the singing is so much finer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Had this on my phone and just had to get it on my kindle fire it is a great game and good time waster
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is the third time I've read this book over the years and it never reAlly gets old to me. I like the way it's written in a letter form and hearing what goes on in this twisted boys mind. I really like the take on mental health too and how it shows what they really think. Interesting.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is just so awesome. this game goes on foreever so there's no way to finish the game and be bored with it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Best way to stay connected to eBay via my cell phone. Great mobile app either on the phone or iPad

B004TI5N38|5.0|A fast paced book with plenty of twists and turns. I did not want to put the book down.  Another good book by David Baldacci.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie is a good one for those who like to find out the order of events from the beginning. A great movie in this series of six movies.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I thought it was going to be a little more funnier than what i had watched.  But still a funny movie.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones self-titled debut album is one of the best examples of punk rock. Anybody even slightly interested in the history of rock, or someone just looking for a terrific album (there's not a bad song to be found) should consider this a priority.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a wonderful escape.  Very psychically visual. I will read this over and over again. Excellently presented, tastefully imagined.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun I recommend getting it but I don't recommend getting wash t he dishes it is stupid and 'm boring all uh d poo is c how many dishes u can wash in 30 seconds
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I am not a Bruno man, but my wife is. I bought this for a gift for her, and she likes it a lot.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I thought it was going to be more volgar than it was. It had it's crude humor moments, which I like, and also had some heart warming moments. Good movie.
B002UEW31I|5.0|Terrific film - intense action, wonderful dialogue!!  The performances, particularly that of Christoph Waltz, were truly outstanding.  Revisionist history at its most satisfying!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The movies was a Christmas gift and my nephew was very excited. He said it is the &#34;best movie ever!&#34;
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me on my toes til the end! Very scary and mind-boggling. Not sure how I feel about the end. A little abrupt. Great read.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Just what I wanted! My son loves watching movies with puppies in them. He will sit for hours watching the same movie if I let him.
B001NLJ33K|5.0|Great update of the TV series...dark, hard, and stylized. Plenty of action, cheesy dialogue, and the plot moves the movie along quickly. Grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy Miami Vice!
1451696191|3.0|I read this book for a book club. The reader travels through Charlie's first year of high school. The protagonist is quiet and introverted with issues that come to light as the story progresses. Awkward among his own peers, he latches onto a group of seniors and soon becomes caught up in their lives and activities, sometimes at the expense of his own. The story is one of teenage angst, and for that reason, it wasn't my favorite read as I'm not a big fan of young adult fiction. That being said, there is still plenty for adult readers to absorb, and I found it easy to empathize with Charlie and become part of his world. I would recommend it to fans of this type of novel. It's along the veins of \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It is a great story. I truly recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained.
B003G4W49C|2.0|The first 2/3 of the book is essentially the same thing over and over again. Basically until you are just about sick of it. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that something was going to change and I had gone so far already.<br /><br />The concept and story is a great idea but unfortunately doesn't develop through the book.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It got to me in a timely fashion and It is one of my favorite shows all time. It is very funny and has a great story line
B0058VW36U|5.0|great fun game. my children all enjoy it. everyone plays it occasionally. Its a mind excercising game. it makes you think
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Reviews title says it all for me. I loved this book and I am looking forward to more of this series. It was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of epic fantasy.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Overpriced, as most Legos are. We are looking forward to starting out own 'Lego Christmas Village' in the years to come.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|its a fun, timeless piece for christmas times. Its good for any crowd. my 16 year old son loves it. The sound is very clear.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This remake proves that there are some ideas best left to the first edition. I only pray that no one thinks about re=making Blade Runner. I really do like the cast. I hope they fire their agents, however.
B000002A46|4.0|anything she sings will be a treat for any music lover. My best selection is Oh Holy Night. Cant believe her range on this song. Crowd pleaser!
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much!  It has greatly expanded my knowledge of the origins of the universe.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning where our universe can from.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use Facebook all the time and is very easy to access, upload pictures and gives u notifications about close friends or specific people. I strongly recommend it for people who want to stay in touch.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Great little case, well made and provides good protection without the bulk of other cases I've used or considered buying.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Allows my Kindle Fire to handle my Facebook interface when away from my laptop. Nice interface for both my Android phone and my Kindle Fire.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The harmonies, rhythms and percussion of this 5-person a cappella  group are simply amazing and must be heard to be appreciated!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it .it is amazing. so much fun. every body should buy game. If you like to beat your best friend scores then why don't. you buy this game

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book Is awsome I would buy it again I love it so much I read it ten times :)
B000SGRONM|4.0|DS doesn't dissappoint.  Even if you've heard some of these stories before, they come to life again, just as funny and as witty as the first time.
B005CRQ2XA|1.0|The book was very good and I could not put the thing down . I read the book in two days, it was that good.
1423140605|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 13 year old daughter.  She was thrilled with my purchase and can't wait to start reading.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Loved it in the theater, and love the unrated version even more.<br />A must see; especially for &#34;Family Guy&#34; fans.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was another item on my daughter's Christmas list. She was thrilled to get it and has already watched it twice.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Compare to the original Bourne movies, it's definitely lack of thrill, not enough action, and the story doesn't make sense at all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great no brainer game<br />A good way to kill time I recommend it highly as the controls are was y
0887081770|3.0|We bought this because we had checked the dilapidated version out of the library over and over and our kids love it. The big version is very cool because it is huge with all the fold outs etc... I didn't notice when ordering it the diminutive dimensions, just the selection of hardcover or board book. Well since we wanted the fold outs it did not seem like the board book was what we wanted we just didn't expect it to be a quarter of the size of the book our kids fell in love with. It is still a great book, but kind of a let down to not be able to find the one we really wanted to get.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved it. the book is great!!!! Romance, adventure and suspense. Awesome! It's a perfect combination! The characters definitely come to life on the pages.
B0086213XW|5.0|I saw this movie on a Salon ten best list and then saw that I could watch it for free on Prime Instant Video. Such a deal. After about 15 minutes, I really got into it. Intelligent dialogue, Sarah Silverman nude, interesting characters with interesting relationships. I'm surprised at all the negative reviews. I think that if you liked The Big Chill, which for a long time was one of my favorite movies, you'll like this. That's my two cents.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|After seeing so many film and play adaptations it is a joy to read the text from the master author himself. God bless us everyone!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|That's right you do not get to click and drag the cells you want to use in the formula, which is a big time waster. if you are going to be doing lots of formulas try kingsoft first, it lets you work quicker!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I thought this was one of the  best books Kinney has done. It was funny and it wasn't dumb like some books that are supposed to be funny are.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|An enthralling story with colorful characters. Perfect mix of past and future.  I couldn't put it down. It certainly makes you think about a lot of what is shaping our lives right now.
0385535147|5.0|you never know what is comming next John Grisham  has to do a lot of research for his books and he does
B005HSL626|4.0|A fun little game to play. My husband, boys and I compete to see who can get the high score.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the series and like the ability to get these books on my kindle when I am out of town.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like temple run you'll love this challenging. sub suffer. if you don't play this you will miss out on a lot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series and like the ability to get these books on my kindle when I am out of town.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|What a great novel this is!!! It brings back so many memories of my childhood, I really love it.  It is very easy to read (English is not my first language), very entertaining.  Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the series and like the ability to get these books on my kindle when I am out of town.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you an even call it a cook book? Ferriss calls out all the usual hurdles to cooking like a pro and adeptly helps you avoid them. Sprinkled in are funny stories, and other useful tips/tricks for your life.<br /><br />Buy it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the series and like the ability to get these books on my kindle when I am out of town.
B00AC8ZJ6K|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible acting and the screenplay is lacking in both content and imagination.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the series and like the ability to get these books on my kindle when I am out of town.
B0081SPK0I|2.0|This game does bring back good old memories of playing this game on the PC and at arcades decades ago. The game play is pretty fast and tilt control works okay on the original kindle fire. Having said, this game does have issues with the car slowing down for no apparent reason as stated by others here on Amazon and the graphics are old school style (It was intended that way).<br /><br />It did freeze my original kindle fire once during the game play and I had to restart my kindle fire by holding the power button for more than 10-20 secs. Looks that this game does have some issues with the original kindle fire at random. I am sure the developer would fix this with future app updates.<br /><br />If you love high quality graphics with realistic effects I suggest that you look for [[ASIN:B008PFPKWU Asphalt 7: Heat (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] But if you love Retro style graphics this may be a good game for you.<br /><br />Happy retro style freeway racing!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It's hard to believe that Eastwood is still cranking out good movies. I found this to be good entertainment and the acting was excellent.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome I know all the cheats but I didn't. use them it is easy with the non cheats.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|It doesn't stand up very well, keeps sliding back down. I like the color and the feel, and the strap that keeps it closed. I got this one cause it was cheaper thank most, but hey you get what you pay for.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Funny, touching, suitable for almost the whole family, though very young children may not get it. Never thought I'd enjoy seeing Bruce Willis in a movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I picked out this book just based on the reviews and am so glad I did. I love stories that capture your heart from the very first chapter and stay with you long after you finish the book and this book will stay with me forever.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a brilliant app for those using multiple devices. The ease of use, options, and the ability to upload messages instantly to all devices makes this a must have.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book that can be enjoyed on all levels.  Very well written and easy to read while posing some of life's most difficult questions. I've recommend it to all my friends!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was somewhat interesting, but neither protagonist was sympathetic. It was not possible to identify or become particularly involved with either of them.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|It was pretty good at the start,but now that I am at the temple of time part with stronger guys its great!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I really enjoyed Susan's new album, especially her rendition of &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34;. I usually don't like this song, but hers is wonderful.
0425264351|5.0|After watching the recent Jack Reacher movie, I was curious as to the story of the main character. Upon a little research, the movie, while the first released, actually follows the events of one of Lee Child's later novels. So I decided that I would start from the logical place: the beginning.<br /><br />The plot of the story is very suspenseful leaving you with your mouth agape in awe multiple times. The mystery, scenarios and overall plot of the story, not to mention Jack Reacher's methods of deducing certain facts, are very well thought out. The only issues I had with the book were with the dialogue. It seems the author let his English grammar flood into the story, the characters use the word 'right' at the end of almost every statement as if asking a rhetorical question. After awhile it got to be a bit annoying for me. However, the imagery was well placed and the characters were very well developed. Throughout the story you were able to sympathize and relate yourself to Jack Reacher in his moments of loss, anger, lust, love, wittiness, brutality, efficiency, etc. Jack Reacher's character is also well developed, and the author does not deviate from this throughout the story, even up until the very end, while still inputting some rather human qualities. Overall, a great read especially for mystery/thriller-seekers. Be warned though, once you pick this up you will find it very hard to set it down and not keep turning pages.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. it is so addicting. I cant seem to stop playing it. I just wish the coin limit was higher.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Get ready to be all-consumed by this book!  I finished this book about three hours ago, and I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't know how Colleen Hoover does this!  She is such a great writer!  She makes you forget it's fiction. Really forget.  Ugly cry forget.  I'm not going to summarize Hopeless, but I am going to recommend it.  Wholeheartedly!!
B005HSL626|4.0|It is a quick, mindless, eye hand coordination game.  Slicing the fruit without touching the bomb.  The whole family likes it.  Great fun!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book gave me an even greater appreciation of what it takes to be a SEAL, and the dangers they face on behalf of our freedom. I recommended this book for a great firsthand account and insight on SEAL mentality and missions.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play this a lot when i play games on my kindle.I like that there is more than one game.I like the classic game best.Ido play the other ones too.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love this movie, and this copy came with a code to redeem it online and receive an UltraViolet copy which you can access this on any computer or device and watch it anywhere.  You can watch it straight from their website or you can download it to pretty much any device.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very handy battery monitor app.  Gives you a usage remaining estimate for several functions.<br />No need to say anything else....others have already said it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing and I think everyone should read it.  It is so much better than the movie, even though I thought the movie was great too.
1449320104|5.0|I've been writing C# based apps for around five years, so I had no problem picking up this book and using it to get up to speed with the latest and greatest C# 5.0 has to offer.  I would not recommend this book to beginner developers, but certainly anyone w/ even a modest amount of C# experience under their belt, or a seasoned Java, C++, etc. developer could pick up this book and run with it.<br /><br />The book starts with a run down of the capabilities introduced with each past release of C#, building up to C# 5.0.  It then provides a solid overview of C# for &#34;beginners&#34; (again, I'd recommend you have some reasonable exposure to C# or other OO programming language before buying this book), and then it dives into clear and concise, albeit advanced topics covering the both common and latest/greatest areas of C# functionality.<br /><br />The book is large, so it's not exactly C# 'in a nutshell', but it is comprehensive, where this one book would get the right candidate rolling w/ C#.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|this movie is incredibly funny and a great movie that everybody should own.  I recommend getting one with the UltraViolet digital copy because you can redeem it online and download it to pretty much any device and multiple users can have access to the movie (like everybody in a family)
0156027321|1.0|I love this story and had read it before but given it away.  This edition has a terrible ugly thick font and was done on the cheap and is not a pleasure to read as a result.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Overall a good finale.<br />A couple of the big moments were lacking in a bit of detail that I would have loved to see.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|A movie based on a real story that really make you think. It's a chance to reflect on what does really count in life and what is a &#34;real limit&#34; to live and be happy.
B008M721MS|5.0|great app very, very, very useful....really helps when all your loved ones live far away and, you want to keep in close contact with them
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book gives you the insight of transfer of power from one president to tne next and how much the do to make the transfer a somooth one, but not all is liked or goes well. In some cases long term friendships do develop and they continue to work together even after the are out of office!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Really good price for the whole Indiana Jones colletion on Blu-Ray.<br />I do wish the DVD's were also included in the set. Nice Gift :)
081297381X|1.0|as a statistician i found most of his arguments superficial, blatantly incorrect, or misleading. Theoretically weak, there were many red flags indicating a lack of knowledge of many statistical disciplines. A first year statisticsstudent could not even get through this book without cringing. Overall, just another misleading popular science (fiction) book that is popular because it allows lay people to think they have a grasp on a subject area that takes a decade or more to master. Think Richard Dawkinsesque pseudo science.
145210655X|4.0|This book is a cute addition to any Star Wars fan's collection. The illustrations are adorable, and the characters, even though some are not consistent with the actual timeline, and their relationships are heart-warming.
1419705849|5.0|This was for my son. He loves this series and says he was not disappointed with the new installment. He read it in less than two days and can't wait to get to the next book whenever it is published.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The DVD set is great. I would have liked to have more behind the scenes discussions. Packaging is very distinctive.
B009ZUKY52|4.0|This keyboard is useful for anyone wanting to expand their studio rig.  It is reliable and has many features, including knobs and faders to access the sounds parameters.  Works well with any recording software.
B005HSL626|5.0|Me and my daughter love to play this game together. Great. And it was a free game. That made it even better.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie was not bad, but the story line, character development, and action sequences did not live up to the original movies
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've played this game on my desktop, so I knew how it worked, and had to tear myself away sometimes.  Got it for my Kindle Fire so I could play in the same room as the TV, so I could still watch that, and also for my 4 yr. old grandson to play when he makes me crazy.  It's simple enough for him to do, even if he has to repeat the same level over and over.  He doesn't mind! An overall fun, simple game to while away during commercials on TV, with no clock to make you frantic!
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I bought this for my pre-teen daughter and she loves it!  I was happy about the quality of it, the ease of putting it together and the great accessories for the dolls.  It was the right price too and Amazon delivered it very quickly.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I got this on my Kindle Fire, but can't seem to make it work.  I choose a category, it goes to the category, but I can't move tiles, and it tells me I need to use the tutorial before playing other categories.  Can't find a tutorial, so can't play!!  Hoping I can figure it out, or I'll just have to drop it from my Kindle!
B000068NOV|5.0|My grandson LOVES this car.  His hobby is collecting models.  It was expensive but they all are in this hobby.  Beautiful detail.  Not a toy but that should be known before you purchase.  It is a collectors item.  Very pleased.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed the book a lot...was not as good as the first but had some interesting parts that I did not expect to happen!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|There were so many analogies drawn between the racing techniques and strategies that could be applied to living our lives with greater intention and honor.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is very awesome. It gives accurate weather info and doesn't crash like the weatherbug app. Would recommend this app to a friend.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A reminder to live in the present with intention and to value the experiences we have for they are intended for a purpose.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|But I play it!  Way too much - its cute and fun - there are other levels - that you have to pay for tho - that sucks!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this application ... She can interact with her friends. Great find. Graphics are great, would recommend to anyone who has young children.
B0086DBE62|3.0|the movie was alright, my wife was the one that really wanted to see it and its more f a chic flick, but its alright.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This movie arrived in great condition and has been watched by the person we ordered it for.  He loved it!
B00846TTDG|3.0|Not bad but honestly not that great. Some of the acting is really cheesy, but its a ok movie i guess
B004SBX112|5.0|My grandkids love playing Angry Birds and so do I.  It passes the time wherever we have to wait.  Lots of Fun!
B0088WGBC8|4.0|as most Denzel Washington movies are. The movie is pretty intelligently laid out, and i would recommend it to anybody
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Warning: Angry Birds can be very addicting!! It sucks you in by being  easy at the beginning and get progressively harder.Makes you think and plan strategy.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|She loved Casper.  My 7yr old liked it very much I would say.  I don't know what else to say
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Cute story line and very funny! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum played a terrific team. Not to mention Channing is never hard on the eyes.
B005LAII08|5.0|pros:  great family movie<br /><br />cons:  a few scary parts for the little ones<br />I don't need the 3D version, but I wanted the digital copy
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have enjoyed this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  It is very easy to use. It makes checking my email simple.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting.  Could play for hours. Like how it makes you think and use your creativity.  Love the challenges and thought process needed.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Good game! Great for kids learning their colors. Along with problem solving. Kids love this game.. This mommy approves game
B003K16P3M|4.0|well, I just wanted to rate it instead of writing a review but amazon wouldnt let me - its what you would expect- nothing more or less! I would definitely recommend it if you are into this genre and type of writing.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Everything that Bob is known for plus a few more.  Great collection!  Some of the remixes are not my favorite but still good.
0545265355|5.0|I was shocked and blown away by the quality of these books.  I have never read them, but I bought them for my brother who is a big fan and has them in a ratty paperback variety.  I was amazed by how good these were for the price.  After getting these my wife wanted a set (she didn't know I had already got her the paperbacks she hadn't read yet).  My brother loves them and proudly displays them on his main bookcase.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|If you are a big Rihanna fan..then you will love it.  I only got this album because it was on sale for 1.99. The beats are good but her vocals are not strong.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|I own more than a dozen<br />Glee CD's....and this is consistently one of--if not THE-- best of my collection.<br />With very few exceptions...the songs, the harmonies, the background vocals...AND the choice of the songs they have sung this season are spectacular.<br />Special favorites...the Rachel/Marley duet of New York State of Mind....The Scientist in the breakup episode is heartbreakingly good.  And the mash up of Home and Homeward bound is chilling and brilliant.  I often wonder if the performers get chills when they sing together and make such beautiful music.  I know I do
B009O2XY12|3.0|Fun and simple to play when you have to wait, like at the dentist or in an airport.  Easy and fun game
B008J34466|5.0|Big Pink Fan...she is way underrated as having a great voice...but especially as a songwriter.  Listen to the words...and the melodies.  B rilliant
B007MDB548|5.0|Great value movie is very high quality. 3D blue ray DVD and digital copy were is the best deal online. Daughter loves this on her iPad.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I already had all of these great songs---well, ok...they're not ALL great--but most of them are--but I got the collection so I could consolidate them onto one CD.  His music/voice/arranging skills are brilliant...along with Richie Sambora.  And they are timeless....and they resonate whether he's rockin or doing a ballad.  An American treasure
034580404X|5.0|I thought they were amazing. I could not put them down, they are a great read but not for a younger group!!
0141342080|5.0|I bought this book for my son. He read it in 2 days. I love when anything gets him excited about reading.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great movie, its a movie that you can sit back and watch with the family. I would most likely buy this movie
B0076DELIG|4.0|It was just a good book and kept me reading it to the end.  Good Plot and story line like most of Michael Connelly books.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show!!  I would not suggest any young viewers but it is a great show.  This is a show that I recomend you should watch and buy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A gripping page turner. An inventive idea  about what it means to try and control a population with fear and lies. Eventually the truth comes out. There are always consequences when keeping secrets. A must read!
B000V7J82S|5.0|Great vinyl, awesome collection. The recording is great, background noise minimal. Some of the live performances are quite good, surprisingly. Hearing the 'call and response' from the audience is like being there. A good sound system helps, of course. Using a Linn / Maggie system, this is quite a revealing recording.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much I am going to read it over and over again! I would give it 10 stars if I could! Now I am going to go buy the other 2 because I loved this so much. It's way better than the movie. So much detail! Buy this  book immediately!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My mother (age 60) kept mentioning whether my boys (age 7 & 9) and I have ever watched this movie, so I ordered this for her and us to watch together...We have watched it 2 times soo far, it's great!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The movie was amazing and the soundtrack lives up to it! I bought the soundtrack as soon as I had seen the movie and have been listening to it on replay! However, I did listen to the soundtrack before I saw the movie but did not buy it. It makes more sense to buy it once you have seen the movie. But, overall, the soundtrack is amazing and no matter when you buy it you will love it. The artists are all amazingly talented and you will enjoy it!
B004AKCME8|5.0|Haven't watched DVD yet, but I know my boys (age 7&9) and myself have watched this movie many times on t.v....We love it!
B008602KQI|5.0|i haven't read the book series, but i find The Hunger Gamesmovie to be very entertaing.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson relly make the story come to life
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kids claim that they have seen this movie in school, but they have watched it 2 times already since they opened it up just 3 days ago...I would say it's great! :)
B000056N8X|5.0|Endgame is the fifth movie in the series. i like this movie because it has Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) and Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) in it. But it does have a sad twist to it.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|My boys have seen ads for this movie, but I never for whatever reason let them watch it before...They have watched their DVD now, and love it!
B008L1DNGI|1.0|I played the tutorial level and the game seemed fun, however due to the developer being as outdated as their previous game systems, this app does not install out of system storage. Fatal flaw. Until this is fixed, the app isn't worth a nickel. Sorry... Uninstalling!<br /><br />Of interest, the Google play version does install to external media. This is all too common... Why is Amazon  ALWAYS a version of two behind?
B000FC1GJW|4.0|Although this volume of the series starts off a bit choppy, the story builds and sucks you into the work of His Dark Materials.  A great read!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I can spend hours on this game! I can't wait to show this to my little cousin the next time she visits! 5 stars!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun logic puzzles, cute and quirky dialogue, and a star-studded cast. What's not to love about Perry the Platypus? Although it would have been fun to see some cut-scenes or references to Phineas and Ferb, it's addicting enough without them. And the more gnomes you collect, the more levels you have access to. I am looking forward to more additions to this soon.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought the book was very well written. Also, I felt that some  of the characters related to me. This book had me turning page after page.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|Great music. I didn't know she could rap like that. Hurricane is the best song on the album. I like all the aongs
B00846REIS|3.0|I don't like reviewing books. I think think this is a good read, not one I'd think would<br />appeal  to most people I know.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Eastwood plays an aging baseball scout and Adams his daughter who is an up and coming partner in a law firm. She follows him on a scouting trip to help him as his health begins to fail him. She takes the opportunity to clear up some problems from her childhood. She also meets J Timberlake for a couple drinks and trivia. Good film
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book. Can start off slow but picks up in the best ways. A great read and as a teenage can really relate to most things. READ THIS BOOK.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Disappointing. Unstable. Others have mentioned the fact that only the first dozen or so items appear in Newsfeed. Access to Facebook was one of the main reasons I purchased the Kindle Fire. Very disappointed. Surely a new version of Facebook for Kindle Fire is in the works.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very helpful but hard to find which word your looking for.  Maybe in the next edition you could put in which word your looking for as a search bar.
B000002IWH|5.0|Who doesn't love The Crow Soundtrack? The \\"Rain\\" song? I mean OMG, that song will rip through your soul and put it back together the right way. This is a must have for any music lover's collection.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002IWH The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I love this book because it helps a lot for when i need to look up some thing i love it
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was a skeptic, but I figured since Amazon offered it as a free download, it was worth trying out. Set-up was simple and easy. No problems remote accessing and controlling my Mac through an Internet or local connection.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It's was a great learning tool I loved it and I hope that more people read this book it is a great book read on keep reading and you can understand How good of a book it is and I loved it and i hope you'll like it that's why I gave it 5 stars enjoy it I did
B00ANR2H4M|1.0|I loved season 1 but I sure feel stupid for buying the season pass for season 2. I can't watch it. Big disappointment. They just  made it as nasty and gruesome as possible. They didn't take any real time to develop the characters, to build a story with suspense. Just blood and gore.  This is just too much. Hate it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It was very helpful to get words in one ear and it doesn't go out the other ear it helps out a lot I loved learning new words this is a good book read it and you well love getting new words and phrases
B007P6VM04|3.0|I like Smash and was glad to get recordings of the musical numbers from the fictional musical &#34;Bombshell&#34; it is set around. But the other songs set outside the &#34;show&#34; I just find uninteresting pop numbers.
B009LROCJI|2.0|This one doesn't do it for me. Admittedly, I come to minimalism believing this particular genre to be the musical equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes. There's just no there there. This work is replete with the kind quasi new-age-y sound field more suited to alleviating the Monday morning hangovers of elevator-riding corporate execs than to stirring the souls of musical cognoscenti.<br />This reworking seems to attempt to piggyback on the success of the classic work it purports to reinterpret with the same kind of cynicism a hack novelist brings to his latest sex-and-violence-laden opus, written more with an eye to selling the screen rights than to creating a work of literature.<br />Maybe someday the Gorekis, Parts, and Reichs of the world will say something that strikes me as worth listening to, but until that day be advised that any and all \\"helpful\\" samplings of this music generously provided me by evangelical members of the cult will be regifted.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Love the movie! Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter rock the screen as usual. Full of laughs and kookiness just like the old tv show.
B00932ANQM|5.0|Uplifting romantic drama. Almost a hallmark movie. No bad language, violence, sex, or drugs. Great scenery that almost makes you want to live in the south.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|a aaaa aaa  ss aaa aaa s aa  aa ss a sd  a a  a  s aa .  aaddd a aaaa a a a a
B004SKJTY6|5.0|The movie was not at all what I was expecting when I read the cast list.  So, before I bought the DVD, I watched this to see how these actors I love pulled off this very proper and serious historical reenactment.  By watching this mini-documentary, I can now see how talented these actors really are.  They made what could have been a real snoozer of a story iton something truely enjoyable.  No wonder it got so many nominations.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My original dvd was borrowed and never returned.Now my set is complete . We can never get enough of Harry Potter!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is soo addictive! it is worth waaaaay more than free! If you are reading this get it!  this game has many aspects to it. this is now. one of my favorite games on my kindle!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really don't hate it;I can't seem to open it to use it. I got a kindle for christmas christmas and I desperattly need some lessons!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and I found this one to be as good as the rest.  Keeps you guessing and I thought that it wasn't such a sad story for the heroine as in The Forgotten Garden although I loved it too.  Very nice read.
B0073SPDHM|4.0|I got this as a present with my new ice cream maker and man what a combo! The recipes are simple and only took me a couple of tries before I was making my own Ben and Jerry`s ice cream from home. Also this is has come in handy for a rainy day date - no need to leave!
B0074AGVWK|4.0|It is a quick read which was interesting for me but still really good.  I like a strong, smart heroine and this book has it.  Strong yet loving.  I liked how the heroine sorted everything out eventually which could also be a very real situation for any of us in our lives.  A lovely holiday read and made me smile.
030759565X|5.0|The recipes are creative and delicious.  There are beautiful full color pictures that go along with each recipe so you can feast your eyes on what's to come!  The stories are witty and entertaining.  I'm an avid chef in my own kitchen and this cookbook is a must!  Easy to follow recipes and delicious outcomes!
B005LAII80|5.0|It's too bad I didn't see this in the theaters in 3D. I generally do not like 3D movies and I couldn't help but think of Stallone's Dredd movie. I never read the Dredd comic books but then again, I don't read comic books. My comparison is with Stallone's version and fortunately, this movie is nothing like that movie. For the 3D, I'm sure the slo-mo scenes make it worthwhile. I'm seriously considering buying a 3D TV because of this movie and I hate 3D home systems.
B0086700CM|4.0|Not the same desire to play as Angry Birds, but the game is quick and fun. If you have 5 minutes to burn, this is the perfect filler.
B003H4RDZQ|1.0|I thought a book with a holiday cover and a title containing the word holiday would be a great one to read during the holidays.  Much to my disappointment, it was anything but cheerful.  What wasn't depressing and horrifying was tiresome.  So much so that I put it down and did not finish it.  I am very sorry I spend my money on such a terrible book!
B008M34INW|1.0|We tried watching this... got about a half an hour in and just couldn't watch another minute.  bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. Sorry, but this one was a flop.
B009738XXM|3.0|I am not the market for this album, it was on sale on Amazon for 2 dollars so I gave it a shot. Not for me but &#34;Call me maybe&#34; is still catchy.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|My son enjoyed the book very much, but didn't crack up laughing out loud as much as the other ones.  Still an enjoyable read for young boys.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Hold your attention, couldn't put it down.  The last book was just as interesting as the first.  Can wait for  more of her work.
B001GUXJQA|1.0|Very slow, not up to the standards of his other books, not one of his best, a big waste of time.
0062014102|5.0|Easy to understand the complex subject matter. Quite a bit of anecdotal evidence to support claims in text. Knowledgeable author.
B002ZG983M|4.0|Ordered this as a gift for our son. He says the DVD is in great shape, and he enjoyed the film.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really enjoyed this app on my droid phone for convenience when I travel. I received a Nexus 7 tablet for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised that I could still read my Amazon books once I downloaded the Kindle app.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|My wife introduced me to musicals with this cd 15 years ago.  It is still my favorite today.  This lineup is the best I have ever heard together but I may be prejudiced since it was my first.  Outstanding voices and music.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This  was my first Jillian DVD and I am so surprised at how great a workout it is for just 20 minutes! I'd been using P90X for years which takes a minimum of an hour a day. Super impressed that I was actually sore with a workout that takes less than half the time!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wow! What a wonderful story for the time we live in. If we do not love and appriciate our Earth we could some day loose it to tecknowledgy hogs and greedgous people as demonstrated in this wonderous and exciting movie. Great story and really great and exciting immagination. Would recommend it to any SiFi lover such as me. Thank You!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A little challenging, but very fun according to my 10 year old son. He would definitely recommend to his friends.
B004YOEFG8|4.0|Great picture quality. Very informative. Would recommend to anyone who really wants to know the facts. Love the 3D. My favorite subjects are Science and Math.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Daughter loves this game. Fun, but also challenging at times! A must have if your out and about or sitting on the couch.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|I really  did learn a lot in this film about the Grand Canyon. The scenery was beautiful and the information well covered. Thank You for making this film and others like it. I would recommend it to all nature lovers.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has out done himself with this book. Without spoiling some of the finer details, his integration of the view points of all 7 of the demigods on the quest was ingenious. Even though at points it feels like some characters are left in the dark, he pulls them back in and gives them meaning. All and all, the finest book in the series so far.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all the extras particularly listening to the voice overs while watching the episodes. There is a whole lot of awesome action in the this season
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was incredible, heartbreaking and so beautiful all in one. The characters were perfectly, the twist, and the fact that the author could add humor, was just amazing!! Definitely a must read!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't like this app. it is slow, I feel like I get more from the Facebook app on my phone th e facebook apps is not great I would rather login
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the fact this part of the series was a happy ending.  Got very tired of the drama of the 1st and 2nd books.  Glad they are happily married and having a norml life.
B002V091IO|5.0|this book is brilliant and everything a good novel should have-humour and wit, touching moments, it's very real and also clever. if you're wondering if you should buy it i say do yourself a favour and do it
B00785P2QC|3.0|Give me coins I like this game Blah blah blah give me coins I like this game blah blah blah purple coookie<br /><br />He he also San s Mendel Uzbek sensual candles consensus checksums
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Wonderful prose depicting the spirit of Christmas and how man and mankind must change.  It's a must read for anyone around the holidays.
6305263248|4.0|Besides the non stop action & great acting from veteran actor R.De Niro among many others, it offers you a Spectacular Tour de France as a wonderful background for this thriller. Bravo !
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but I was expecting something slightly more Austen-like. It was just not what I thought it would be.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|Great storyline and acting. The wardrobe and sets are ok. This movie is very creepy and will freak your mind at times. The cast of actors is ok at best, for this type of movie. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography. There are some dry or dull areas in this movie, but they are minimal. Buy it on Blue Ray, or rent it. Your option…I recommend renting this one guys. Thanks.
B0011Z52EW|3.0|Bought mp3 download. Recipient happy. Music is questionable, at best but a favorite of my niece. Wish there was a non-explicit version available & longer samples.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|Great storyline and acting. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great! This is good entertainment to pass the time away. However, be prepared to be BORED out of your MIND!!! This is so slow and dry...make sure to have your pillow and blanket nearby, because you WILL fall fast asleep several times. Otherwise, the sound quality is good, with great cinematography.  However, I recommend renting this one. Thanks.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I loved this book! I liked how Adam went from angry, depressed, rock star in the beginning and then went back to his normal self by the end of the book. I highly recommend this book and the first book as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading, it was a great book. I cannot not wait to start the next book in the trilogy
B008476HBM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite reads! While the story comes to a predictable end, the journey to it is such a pleasure that I have reread and written down passages that will probably stay with me forever.
0812993357|5.0|I am still reading, it really quite a lovely book. Grace showed a glimpse of the 60s and 70s london fashion scene.
B0086700CM|3.0|OK So, I just got the kindle fire and it is an amazing reader and great to play apps on. I got Temple Run 2 days ago... and the 3d day I couldn't tilt!!! I deleted the app and installed it again... STILL I CAN'T  TILT!!:(  anyone know what I should do??
0765365278|5.0|this was one of the best books i have ever read it has amazing storyline great characters and an unbelievably well created magic system and world in which you are immediately immersed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have only played it a couple times, which I like what I have played. My daughter rea;ly likes it.
0061537934|5.0|I'm a huge dog and car lover so this story couldn't be more perfect. You will cry for sure, but it is still worth reading.  Lovely story and one that i have passed around and recommend over and over!
1579129129|5.0|My wife likes skulls for some reason, so this book for Xmas was a definite hit. She couldn't put it down. Beautiful photography.
B007EECSFA|4.0|An intriguing read, although I guessed the ending 3/4 through- it was still a surprise. I've read almost all her novels.
B0001IMCDE|1.0|Unfortunately, I purchased this video twice from amazon. The first time i got it, I purchased it from a company out of the UK,, it would not play in my DVD player, or my new Mac laptop.  It only cost me a few bucks, so i thought i would chalk it up to being my mistake and not bother with a refund. I really wanted to see this old movie, so I went on again and bought it from Minneapolis.  But it still won’t play! I think it should have stated in the DVD description that it is not in the correct format for US use. Very disappointed.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Highly addictive but extremely fun! Thanks for making a game that is totally different from everything else out there. Two thumbs up!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The author makes much of the fact this raid was a team effort. He's right, of course. But there is much we can learn about courage and discipline and sacrifice in the reading of his exploits. Nice job. Makes me wonder, though, what does an ex-Seal do with his life after leaving?. Life must seem pretty hum-drum these days.
B009MO57H6|3.0|Not enough action and Milla is just not quiet the old Alice yet (again). I was disappointed but the end is very promising for a lot more action in the next sequel.
1451695195|4.0|A well written book by Dr. Eben Alexander - the best since Raymond Moody's LIFE AFTER LIFE (1970's) Regardless of how the reader feels about Near Death Experiences (NDE's), Alexander is convincing coming from his own experience of NDE's, which he had doubted as a skillful and noted neurosurgeon. His transparency seems genuine and his glimpse from The Other Side is inspiring. He may not necessarily 'prove heaven' exists, but he certainly joins the pantheon of others who have experienced NDE's and given us all reason to believe in the possibility of another reality exceeding this earthly one. The book inspires me to make the best of this current journey I'm on and look for evidences of 'heaven' here.
B007PKDW44|4.0|Oh well, it's music and you either like it or you don't. Mainly bought it for two of the songs but the rest is fine as well.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Two Graves is thoughtfully plotted and well-written. It sucked me in pretty well....I managed to read it in two evenings. Several of the apparent mysteries in earlier books are explained in Two Graves, and in a satisfying way. Pendergast has been around long enough that there's not much new to learn about him, so it's not possible to capture all of the magic of some of the earlier books, but the characters introduced here were, for the most part, fascinating. I found the extended action scenes in the last third of the book to be drawn out and a little monotonous (also stretching credibility, even for Pendergast), but overall there's a lot more to praise here than to criticize.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app will not work correctly on my kindle fire. It will only load a few updates correctly, then the rest are messed up, and it won't continue to loaf.
0143119680|5.0|With all the vampire and witch books abounding I really wasn't interested in reading yet another.  However a friend raved about this book so I reluctantly began to read it.  It took me two tries to get into it, that's how reluctant I was!  But then suddenly something clicked and I devoured this book in a quick gulp!  It is almost a shame that the market is flooded with vampire and witch books, because this is truly a story well worth reading, experiencing, wallowing in, returning to.  Matthew and Diana are a unique couple.  Their personality and character unfold into many layers with each twist and turn of the plot.  Read it! You will not be sorry.  I am chomping at the bit for book 3 to be released.
0307593525|5.0|I will spend more time updating this review as I go through the rest of the recipes in here but this is just one of those books that should be in any chef's kitchen. Not only are there hundreds of delicious recipes, there are also illustrations by Paul Child, Julia's husband. She goes over what items you need in your kitchen, what pots and pans to look for, different utensils, etc. Highly recommended.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|but Robert Downey and Jude Law are not available.<br />They will be replaced by Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham.<br /><br />I think I paid $5 for this dvd.<br />That was too much.<br />Save your money for the miniature action figures for your kids.<br /><br />The only reason for making another one would be to bring back the ever-lovely and interesting Rachel McAdams, and give him her decent screen time next go-round....if she wants it<br /><br />Guy Ritchie should stick to his British gangster films...or making video games.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is just a good game to spend time with. It has been around for several years and enjoyed by many people.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is one of the best shows ever. It is very entertaining and suspenseful and it's hard to stop watching.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a real challenging game.which makes you work for the results. It is hard to set the game down.
6305428425|5.0|Completely happy with this purchase.  I bought this as a gift and it came in two days and was a brand new copy.  This movie is a classic most women I know love.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a fun game for all ages.  It is easy to understand and play.  I'd recommend it to everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this on my kindle fire's and it's beautiful and more accurate than the competitors' apps.  Everything from a quick overview of the day to all the detail you could possibly want.
8866131350|5.0|Genial bok med 18 mnd. kalender. Fin å ha i baklomma. Det er noe kult over å bære en Moleskin (det siste mest for å få nok ord)
B008KE3960|3.0|More than I want to manage on my phone.  If I get a chance to try it out on my kindle, I'll come back and add to this review.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This film was not what I expected, but I loved it. It made me laugh and cry. The main characters are superb actors. The setting is gorgeous. If you are looking for something unexpected, quirky and something to make your heart melt, but not in a cheesy way, see this film.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Good book, but not as strong as the first two in the series IMHO.  A bit hokey, but Pendergast fans will not be disappointed.  Leaves the door open for more to come.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is, well since I am not a woman and that may be the reason I may not have 'gotten' it, very poorly written. It reads like it may have been a submission to an erotic website that was fleshed out to a full novel.<br /><br />Now I am not saying that it was horrible, because it wasn't. It was just to simply written. With better writing and more depth this could have been an excellent read. It was erotic and fun, but felt 'dumbed down'. This may be how other romance novels are, don't know.<br /><br />It did get my wife 'reved up' a bit, so for that, I give it high marks. For the read however, low marks.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Had a lot of action, really told a story, and the quality on my roku was great love the hd on this movies.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Several people suggested that I read this, and I will pass along the recommendation.  You will never see financial markets the same way again.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love phillip phillips hes the man and hopefully my man one day.. lol.. jk but love his first cd can't wait to buy his second album.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|good, solid fare for the plane ride to Hawaii...<br />Can't imagine Tom Cruise in this role....<br />good action and story line.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great entertainment! Lots of action without too much violence.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is this is not my favorite type of movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Very cumbersome.  Newsfeed does not give more than about 10 feeds so cannot really catch up unless you look at it every 2 minutes.  Does not update very quickly.  Does not fit screen on Kindle fire HD well...too much scrolling needed.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Its pretty fun playing it with your your friends or just by yourself I recommend this app for everyone of all ages!
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This app has some great colors but not as many drawing options as I thought it would - for instance, I cannot find a way to change the point size of the drawing instruments, so it is really hard to add details or cover big areas easily.  I would also like better icons (don' t understand what they all do) and a way to do a light touch vs heavy. Still, it was a mindless way to pass some time creatively.
1419705849|5.0|Great Book, Diary of a Wimpy Kid series are all fantastic. Good price for this book! If you've read the other books, get this one! You'll enjoy it!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Simplistic and forced. Unrealistic and unintelligent. For people who never read. Out of the hundreds of books I have read, this is the worst.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Good book. Great drawings. Loved it, like I love the series. I can't wait to buy the other books. You should read this, bro.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed it could hardly put it down.  Well written, engaging story, easy to relate characters, and entertaining.  I am not much for reading books because of hype but I would read it again.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love reading something that makes me react out loud. Much better than the series on TV... buying book two now.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|My son recommended this and said I'd like it a lot. I like the combination of story and puzzles. The graphics are pretty cool and it is fairly intuitive.  But it helps to read the instructions that pop up!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Without any of the Xtras you can probably see on YouTube, on sale for $17 & still living in a standard definition DVD household - how could I refuse.<br /><br />Three great movies.  I will watch them many times over.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game. app works great with few ads and even better is that its free! would totally downlod it again
030758836X|1.0|Folks, someone has to say it:  there's a vast difference between good writing and crude language, so let's not confuse the two.  No one would confuse the experience of dining at a five-star restaurant with dumpster diving, so let's not pretend that the \\"C\\" word is a hallmark of witty dialogue.  Even if we are to overlook Gillian Flynn's lowbrow language, there is little to praise in this story.  Tone?  Painfully narcissistic.  A writer (disguised as a character) breaking off from the narrative to compliment her own brilliance is about as clever as a model immersed in her own reflection.  Characters?  Whining, unsympathetic, one-dimensional cartoon cliches.  Plot?  So far-fetched it can't be taken seriously, but neither is it funny.  If you want to read a novel that successfully blends an outlandish storyline with humor and satire then I strongly recommend  Naked Came the Leaf Peeper, a collaborative storytelling jamboree from Asheville, North Carolina. On the other hand, a story that is truly dark and sinister with a well-paced narrative, strong characters, and a compelling mystery is Christine Falls by Benjamin Black.  I exhort you to spend your time and money wisely!
B002RKSCA6|1.0|not a kindle fan. downloaded because it was free. didnt redownload the app on my new phone and anyways, this was all messed up, pages not in order.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I would rate this movie a 4.5 stars, but since I rented it via Amazon Instant Video on my PS3, I have to downgrade it to 3 stars. The sound quality was horrible. I had my TV's volume on full blast and could not hear a thing.<br /><br />In the end I had to stop the movie and hook up my PC via HDMI in order to hear the movie; only to find out that Amazon doesn't support HD on PCs. What a bummer. :/
B004FRX0MY|1.0|it was free so i downloaded it. cant listen to it anymore as i deleted the app that was required to have to listen to the songs since it took up too much space on my phone

0060899220|5.0|Wonderful book! A must have for any culinary student, but reserved to just professional cooks. Funny and very enlightening. General public would learn a great deal about the next time they go out to eat and the wonderful misfits that cook for them. Maybe the general public might have a bit more respect for them too.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|gift for hubby. missed the first 2 seasons. or course he loves it. what more am i supposed to say.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|What's to say? Great soundtrack to one of the best musicals of all time! I would recommend to anyone who enjoys musicals.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it is sooo additive. it is also frustrating at the same time but fun. I find myself playing it often just to try to beat it!
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|Watched with my high school freshman daughter. Topics are current. Writing is poignant. Lots of laughter in the room. Acting was even better than I remembered. Judd Nelson dominates but Emelio Estevez steals more scenes than I remembered. Still amazes me they pulled off a one set, mostly dialogue movie back when Terminator-style movies were the rage. John Hughes was awesome - RIP.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|I will see everything that Kristin Scott Thomas does, bedide being a great actrees. she has a knack of picking very interesting subjects.  A lot of friends are saying now how good she is and she steals the movie.  Well, she's always been good in everything even in two turkeys, but in this one I also liked Ewan McGregor, this was the first time I've really noticed him.  This movie was one of the few good movies I saw last year, a very funny script and well diected..<br />I will not go into the story, I so dislke reviews that give it all away, anyway just seeing the trailor will give you the jest of it, If you like funny dialogue annd wit, this is for you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it!!!! I cannot wait to read the other books!!!! I certainly hope the other books can be borrowed as well!!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I really thought this was a neat game. My thoughts are that it encourages problem solving añd patience. Which is good not only for kids but also for adults too.

B009GESJH2|5.0|I received this just in time for wrapping.  It made it for Christmas and was the perfect gift for my husband who is incredibly difficult shop for.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Very slow start, did like it a bit more toward the end and did sympathise with the characters, but I feel JK's lovely descriptive writing was just a but ott for somewhere like Pagford
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fun, humor, action...great acting. Just a great all around flick. The guy playing Bones is spot on and alot of fun.
0345803485|5.0|I could not take my eyes off this books pages. I'm planning to reread in the near future. Loveeeed it.
B004F1F32A|5.0|The entire movie I was fully engaged and on the edge of my seat.  Excellent film that will def keep your attention up until the end.  Good story on a situation that actually happens.

B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories, it's very honest and kind, loving and hopeful.  I like that the women are strong and that they stick together.  The story is better than any of the films, but I love the films too.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book totally worth the hype. Characters r great Couldn't put it down. Excited for rest of trilogy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|THE best example I've tried of ingenious, polished indy games out there.  It was great on the PC years ago, and even better now on tablets, as a touch screen lends itself perfectly to this type of game.  Addicting, sometimes frustrating, but always challenging and a ton of fun.
1419705849|5.0|For being a brand new book the price was awesome, my son really likes the series. Cannot wait to buy more
B008D37J6O|4.0|Overall, I was satisfied with the performance of this free video player app for my kindle fire HD.<br /><br />Notoriously, the kindle fire does not play all video file types, which was a pain.<br /><br />I tested the app on the movie Conan the Barbarian.  I found the image quality to nearly match the HD quality on my PC.  It seemed that it did not render completely perfect, but this was fine.  There are a couple of bugs with the app, it doesn't seem to shut down completely all the time when exiting to the home screen.  The sound of the movie continued to play.<br /><br />A small google based advertisement banner appears at the top of the screen which is probably how the developer earns money.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I wanted to read this as I love all his books. I tried calling Amazon when it did not arrive with no success. It might be because I changed my e-mail as I was getting so much spam on AOL. My new e-mail is bidi.wheelwright@pallspera.com.
B000T5O48U|5.0|Starring Dee Wallace, Daniel Hugh-Kelly and a young Danny Pinatauro (TV's \\"Who's The Boss?\\") \\"Cujo\\", based on the Stephen King Novel, is regarded as one of the scarriest films based on a King book.<br /><br /> The plot deals with a demented dog suffering from a dreadful disease that goes on a killing spree. It's owners, a mother and son, are trapped in a car as the dog awaits to kill them both.<br /><br /> The film is extremely graphic, yet the movie went on to gross over $20,000,000 at the box office when it was released in 1983.<br /><br /> You will never look at dogs the same after viewing this!
B007SGM084|5.0|pulls you right into the story line. entertaining read and keeps your interest throughout. quick read. tried to resist the trend but was talked into reading it and loved it.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King originally wanted to publish a book about the John F. Kenneddy assassination way back in 1971, but dropped the project due to the fact that he knew he had to take the time to do extensive research on this particular time in American history, one of the most controversial moments for Americans.<br /><br /> \\"11/22/63\\" deals with what it would have been like if someone could go back in time and prevent the killing of the most beloved President in United States history on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.<br /><br /> In the novel one of King's characters realizes he can indeed go back in time and perhaps he can prevent the assassination and perhaps a better world would take place.<br /><br /> Critics and fans agree that \\"11/22/63\\" is one of King's most ingenious writings. There has also been talk the novel will indeed be turned into a full-length feature film.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|My daughter and her husband were very happy when they received the complete set.  The love the series so now they can see it anytime.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Makes me want to get a group together and have a bonfire or something. Fun and funky, and makes you feel chill and excited at once.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy trying to kill off all the birds and watching the points add up- especially some of the more challenging levels.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I give this movie five stars because it is a great movie. It is full of action and has great acting. I definitely recommend buying this movie! Thank you Amazon.
1933865474|5.0|Interesting book.  Like the work of Bruce Timm.  As an artist my self, I like to follow certain artist. I will keep this in my art library.
B007VYQ9G2|3.0|I've loved the Disneynature movies from the beginning. Earth, Oceans, and African Cats were outstanding. Chimpanzee falls short of their legacy.<br /><br />The previous three movies had a soundtrack and a narrator that brought out the wonder in the incredible wildlife footage portrayed. This one had Tim Allen and a couple of goofy songs. It was distracting and annoying. I like Tim Allen, I really do, but I couldn't listen to him without hearing Tim the Tool Man Taylor in every single line. Who wants to play \\"one of these things is not like the other\\" for an hour and twenty minutes? Having no narrator at all would have been stronger than this.<br /><br />The pacing also felt rushed. African Cats also spanned a long period of time, giving us the opportunity to watch Mara and the cheetah cubs grow up under their mothers' care (or partially without her, in Mara's case). They did it well, managing time and manipulating scenery to help clue the viewer into significant time changes, making transitions feel seamless. Chimpanzee relied on such tactics as \\"3 years later,\\" which showed the seams.<br /><br />That said, the chimps were given a well-rounded portrayal, the footage really was incredible, and the story was heartwarming. I couldn't give it less than three stars. I only wish it had steered less toward the cheap comedy and more toward the natural wonder of these creatures. They have great personalities; they don't need crutches like power-tool humor. Ultimately, I'm glad I have it to complete my Disneynature collection, but it's just not as good as the others.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The was a lot of hipe about the movie and the big stars in it.  Was a little disapointed that Chuck had such a small part in it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like this book because it is filled with lots of action and adventure. If you like books like action adventure then I recommend this book for you. I saw the movie and that is really good too but you have to read the book.
1933865407|5.0|I am a fan of Bruce Timm. Thought provoking. Interesting book. I like to follow certain artist. I will keep this in my art library.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked Katniss' characterization better in the book. She was a hardened person with little emotional baggage. This is pretty interesting for a 16 yr old girl/woman. All of the action was the same as movie....just the in between parts were better. I look forward to the next book.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|From beginning to end I enjoyed this movie.  I didn't release this movie was the precurser to the Alien franchise until the very end.
B007NCSQFO|2.0|On this one, I was just curious of her music and lyrics, the entire album was on sale like for 3 dlls  so I got it but to be honest not much of my style.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my little sister at a great price during the Holidays. Must say this film even if its audience was directed more towards children made me as an adult fall in tears. Brilliant film and would definitely recommend this for all ages, young and old. My only disappointment was that the storyline was too short.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Drama, suspense, mystery one of the best films of the year! If you are looking for a good movie look no further.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Ramin playing the Phantom and Sierra as Christine Daae, make the perfect couple in this live production at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England. You can really feel the Phantom's (Ramin) intense desire and insanity for Christine, while Christine's (Sierra) doe like eyes and innocence draws you in just like her incredible voice. Their romance and chemistry together really touches you to the heart. They are such incredible performers and singers that really draw and pull you in as though you were part of the audience, they make you grow a yearning heart for this couple that makes you want to root for them even if the Phantom is crazy. I didn't realize it when I went last year there that it was THE ACTUAL one at the Royal Albert Hall the same weekend I was in London. Had I have known it was the 25th Anniversary one, I would've honestly watched it live. I still do this day kick myself for not watching it but purchasing the film makes me feel a bit tad better. &#60;3 This!
B005LAII62|5.0|Great movie and got it at a great price here on Amazon. We love movies that are great for the family and this was one of them..
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I didn't realize there was a part two to The Phantom of the Opera and when I did was was stocked and just had to purchase this. It's a live production that takes in New York on Coney Island but was performed in Australia. Different casts from the one at the Royal Albert Hall 25th Anniversary one but still brilliant and beautiful!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good storyline, Clint Eastwood did a good job again. It was a movie well worth watching, not like some of the junk out there
B008UFUOH6|5.0|This is my favorite new holiday CD this year...I buy two or three for my collection each year and this was a welcome surprise.  Tracey's voice is unique, the arrangements are cleverly done and the tone warm and cozy.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|He does love this little game, and I like it because he does have to figure out how to get the jelly to where he needs to be, so it makes him think a little
B008M721MS|4.0|hard to write a review on something I haven't used yet, check back with me later. guess that's it for now, thank youToby
1419705849|5.0|Son loves the wimpy kid series, and my mother bought this for my son for Christmas.  Great book, and he loved it!
B003YOZNBU|3.0|overall the movie was entertaining but lacked a solid storyline for a sequel.  Megan Fox's character was very to stand
0060536276|5.0|I had never heard of this before, and we took it with us on a long trip.  Kids wanted to listen to over and over (7 and 9 yrs old), so it was a hit!
B007XF0X16|4.0|it is a good movie but it is lacking in story an  character development. I always love watching movie about Greek mythology.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|this game is too much room for my kindle fire!!! I hope its an ok game or better but I don't know yet because its taking FOREVER to download! I wish it doesn't take up millions of megabites.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Enjoyed this game very much.I love hidden objects games. This one was alot of fun.Great game for the price. Would like to see more games like this  one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Its a visual beauty (in blue ray) it seems to start a little slow, but its pure entertainment .If you're fan of the alien movies it will explain some things. Take this one for a ride it wont leave you empty.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|A person can only see the first ten updates in her newsfeed on Facebook for Kindle Fire.  Not sure why they designed it this way, but I definitely think this is something that needs to be fixed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I bought this game for the Wii and am very disappointed with it. This version is close to the original minus the joysticks.
B008Y7J1Y2|4.0|Great movie, knew that when I bought it. I wanted to watch it while traveling.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B001H7SJLC|5.0|Nice alum. Heat sink quite scythe fan like always very nice product will buy again on the next build. Just buy it its worth the money
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Mildly entertaining It kinda  embarrasses me that I rented it since its kind of an absurd story line but wasn't too bad
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This book is a good read for all Clancy lovers. It does bog down a bit as he sets the stage, but the last half is vintage Clancy, and worth the time.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Love this movie saw it in the theaters as well . Well cast film with great acting, costumes, very authentic. Those boys did some crazy stuff. Gotta be able to handle violence if you watch this
B0081SPK0I|2.0|Not too pleased - would really like to remove it from Kindle. Maybe I'll get better with more time and practice.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Well done movie based on a true story. It's kind of long but didn't really seem like it. Gerard Butler is a good actor
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|My family came in over Thanksgiving and we rented this as something safe for everyone to watch. And personally, I love heroine movies. I loved The Princess and the Frog. This movie, really, was kind of disappointing. It was a bit slow and frankly uninteresting; 3/4 of the fam lost interest halfway through.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|Sachs Baron Cohen is crazy. I don't know how he comes up with this stuff. It's raw not for miss priss type people. If you've seen his other movies you should know what to expect.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book makes you appreciate what you have.  It also allows you to think what it would be like to never know the outside world.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a page turner book.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|The layout for all details does not consistently display on my Kindle Fire hd. The only solution is to remove and reinstall the program . I have written the developer with an apothetic response given to me.  Given their little concern and the quality of the program, I would avoid buying this program.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really good.  I could not put it down. Nicholas sparks writes the best love stories great read
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Had me laughing out loud the store time! I just wish it had been a little longer. Would definitely recommend to cat owners or anyone with a sense of humour.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Very nice, a quality product. Bought as a gift for Christmas and they loved it.<br />I would love one myself!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|So addicting ! I've spent hours on this games ! It's very easy to level up once you get into the game ! I love this app ! Also , it's a great way to kill time !
089381525X|4.0|This huge book of photographs documents manual workers around the world, circa 1986 to 1991.  According to the Foreword, it was intended as homage to workers and \\"a farewell to a world of manual labor that is slowly disappearing.\\"  In more hifalutin language, \\"[t]he images offer a visual archaeology of a time that history knows as the Industrial Revolution, a time when men and women at work with their hands provided the central axis of the world.\\"<br /><br />That sentence and much else of the thirteen-page Foreword does not particularly resonate with me.  Many of the photographs do, however.  There are more than 370 pages of them, all in black-and-white.  The subjects range from agricultural workers on sugar cane and cocoa plantations, to fishermen off Galicia and Sicily, to slaughterhouse workers in South Dakota, to steelworkers, canal diggers, coal miners, and the Chunnel borers.  For me, the most striking and memorable photographs are those of the shipbreakers on the beaches of Bangladesh and the gold miners in Serra Pelada, Brazil.  Both sets of photos are otherworldly.<br /><br />In my youth, I had several jobs that most people would call manual labor, but it was nothing like much of the work depicted by Sebastião Salgado in this book.  In these pictures the work consists of putting one's entire corporeal being into the labor; oftentimes the workers are transformed into beasts of burden.  And a surprising number of them are women.<br /><br />WORKERS is very handsomely produced.  Many of the photographs cover a two-page spread.  Others are reproduced on fold-outs, with as many as a dozen printed on a two-page fold-out.  There is no text on any of the 370 pages of photographs.  Instead, factual information concerning each of the photographs is provided in a separate 24-page pamphlet, so that one can page through the book itself and, if one desires, consult the separate pamphlet for photograph-specific information without awkwardly flipping back to an appendix of sorts at the rear of the book.<br /><br />I suppose the photographs reflect advanced and admirable photographic techniques.  Many of the workers are portrayed at close range, sometimes disconcertingly or even disturbingly so, and Salgado tends to use odd angles or perspectives.  He also is partial to pictures that are hazy with smoke, dust, and fumes (even sulfurous volcanic fumes).  The super-saturated blacks of the photographs are powerful, but eventually they become overwhelming and gloomy.  You need to make your way through this book in a number of sessions, rather than all at once.<br /><br />WORKERS is expensive, but over the years I have returned to it more frequently than most books of photographs I own, and each time I find something new as well as a renewed realization for how much my life differs from so many millions of my working brethren.  Four-and-a-half stars.sorts at the rear of the book.<br /><br />I suppose the photographs reflect advanced and admirable photographic techniques.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this twist on the Sherlock and Watson duo...I can't get enough of this show...I am a huge Holmes fan and in my humble opinion this show does him justice in the new age....if I could I would give it a hundred million stars!!!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought the book was an engaging read.  This book is relatable to young adults and its one that can keep them reading.  It is hard to find books that will really engage young adults but this one will.  Great for adults to read to get a young adult perspective.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is the most wonderful and heartwarming story about Santa Claus.  The whole family loves it!  I believe watching it at least once a year will be a new family tradition.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Edit: Scottish, not Irish.<br />Expectation: Feel-good story about a courageous girl with great graphics.<br /><br />Reality: Great graphics provide real life detail for content that is not for young children. I wish I had read the Amazon paid reviewer who stated that the move wasn't suitable \\"for those under 10 years\\" prior to purchasing the movie. Lesson learned.  The content included a lot of violence and some animated nudity (I'm unsure why animated nudity is different than actual nudity anymore because there is such a high level of detail).  Are animated sex scenes ok since they are `just' animated?  Anyway, back to the review. In terms of content the movie is a poorly written chop job. The writers worked hard to negatively stereotype the Scottish as apparently moronic idiots who can't keep their pants up while forgoing such trivialities as a plot. There were a few small laughs scattered throughout the movie.<br /><br />Plot (spoilers):  The story begins with a bear named Mor'dur attacking a family randomly picnicking in the woods.  I'll leave the explanations for the bear's existence to internet research, but suffice to say it is an angry ancestor. The young girl, not wanting to be married to one of the local Irish dolts her mother wishes, has a witch cast a spell on her mother.  As a result of the spell the mother is turned into a bear. Long story short - they run through the castle, there are multiple kilt-raisings, and the mother bear ends up killing the angry ancestor Mor'dur.<br /><br />Summary: I would not purchase the movie again.  I enjoy watching movies with my daughter in which she can observe strong female lead characters portray positive role models while telling an entertaining story.  With Brave, Disney obscured a good tomboy princess idea with bear chicanery and idiotic, imbecilic behavior by every male character in the movie.  The resulting product is neither entertaining nor positive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all three books, such an awesome feeling to read each of these and look so forward to the next. The ending was great too!
B00633W614|5.0|I love Jeffry Archer and have been reading his books for years.  Sins of the Father is absolutely wonderful.  I'm hoping this entire series will be a movie!
B008YWY0HK|2.0|My daughter and I saw this movie in the theater and we loved it.  However, the picture quality of the purchased DVD is not that good.  It is very red and dark.  We have so many other movies on DVD that are fine.  Perhaps our DVD player needs to go, but I was surprised at the picture quality for this movie.  Anyway, the movie itself is very heartwarming.

B008M87GJK|5.0|This app is easy to use and makes following world new easy. The BBC i s a great news source and this app makes following them a a piece of cake.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|My fiance and I love this game and something we both can play. very colorful and such a puzzle solver
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I love this app.  If you're a beginner like me, it actually can teach you how to play.  It has an option that shows you moves to make, then you can make those moves or not - you're choice.  I love to watch the selected moves because it teaches me how to plan for future moves, and how to protect the different pieces.  The more you play, the more you learn.  It offers different levels of expertise.  I started at the beginning and am now at level 4.  I think soon, I'll be able to move to the next level.  The app also gives your brain a good workout, and I am finding that the longer I play, the better I am getting at analyzing things in the real world.  Even if you have never played chess, you can play with this app.  It explains the game to you, and the options for moves by each piece.  I initially downloaded this app to use as entertainment.  Not only does it entertain me, it allows me to improve my ability to learn and plan.  Great app![[ASIN:B004OG7XY2 Chess Free]]
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is my life. I feel I have become more creative and it inspires me to try and create new things. Plus it's so organized!
B0060D123K|5.0|This is a classic story written by one of the greatest authors. The muppets help tell the story in a way that makes it easy to understand for children.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|This book has been read by my 12, my 15 year old and myself and we all loved it.  It filled in gaps in my knowledge about physics and I think it is a book every parent should buy for their children (and themselves).  It is a good practical overview of where we came from and a necessary antidote to all the half truths and myths that our children are told throughout their schooling.
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim Carey does such a good job in this movie, he really should have won an award. The little actress that pays Cindy Lu Who is very skilled at her craft as well. Perhaps we will see more of her as she grows.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I had this app before then my sister did some thing to it so my whole kindle was like I first got it because I didn't have anything so it restarted my game and I couldn't find it for weeks I was so mad!!!!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie didn't really keep my attention. Maybe an ok movie to watch around Halloween, otherwise I wouldn't waste my time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is pretty good for age 11 and for kids who want a book about Valentine and want to have a couple
030759565X|5.0|If you like her blog, you'll love the book.  It's wonderful!  The stories before each recipe are fun as always.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old watched this movie for the first time this holiday season and told anyone he met about it for the next two days. He loved it! I highly recommend the movie and the book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book and I plan to read the books and watch the movies  parents this is great for the kids

B001CNFZGI|4.0|Nice.  Basic Enigma style with tons of heavy beat and mistic sounds. A wonder of words. sdj os ndsfo ns
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great for kids of all ages it is witty and entertaining just like all of the other books.I just have to say good job Jeff Kinney and keep it up.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these for my son, aged 12, and he broke them in a matter of days.  That does not make this a bad product, but be aware that the ear bud portion of the headset will snap if you do not exercise proper care.  Most likely my son stuffed the headphones in his backpack and the one ear bud snapped off.  Totally his fault.  Otherwise these earphones are great because they are lightweight, and unlike ear buds, will stay in place while you are running.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love Diary of Wimpy Kid. Jeff Kenney is very talented. I think everyone would love this book. Read it. The Thrid Wheel is one of the best.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is an awesome app I'm sure if u try it u'll like it. It's adorable. Everyone should c this it's really fun.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett does not disappoint with &#34;Winter of the World.&#34;  A great piece of historical fiction and an extremely quick read for 800+ pages.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It was a great story, very nicely woven together, and definitely for grown-ups. JK Rowling has quite a range as a writer. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Can't stop playing, it's totally addictive!!  Great for killing time in doctor's offices, or treating insomnia.  :) Better than counting sheep, &#34;shoot&#34; birds!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Heard lots of complaints about this movie because it does stray from the book, however, I felt that the environmental theme was very well carried out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome everyone has to read this book! Stop reading this and read this book! Most awesome book ever!
0786956291|1.0|The red box is deceiving because it would imply a throwback to old school D&D but trust me as a player of every released edition, this is the complete opposite. I was looking for an old school D&D experience, where the gameplay doesn't focus on a confusing array of abilities and tactical miniature gameplay that boggles the mind of the newbie.<br /><br />There is a nice story that helps you create a character, but after doing so you will quickly realize how ludicrously over-complicated this version of D&D is when your first level character has several skills that are confusingly similar but extremely situational. By the time you get to level 2, you will still have no idea how best to play your character, and have a whole new set of abilities dumped on you.<br /><br />Everything that came with this set was nice, but it is not D&D, but an extremely complicated miniatures strategy game. If you want old school pencil and paper D&D like I did, go try out the D&D next beta, where they've really done a great job of bringing it back to what makes D&D fun.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite Match 3games . There is enough challenge in the beginning to keep me from getting bored. Yet each level provides a greater challenge than the one before. I highly and emphatically recommend this game.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|I WAS NEVER UNHAPPY WITH A MOVIE PURCHASE FROM AMAZON BUT FOR THE PURCHASE OF KILLER JOE- I LIKED THE MOVIE- THOUGHT THE ACTING WAS GOOD AND STORY COMPELLING- BUT I THOUGHT THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE CHICKEN LEG SCENE WENT OVERBOARD- I REALIZED THE SCENE WAS OUTRAGEOUS ONLY WHEN I SAW THE NC VERSION ON YOUTUBE.  SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND THE CUTS, BUY THIS VERSION, IF NOT, WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE NC-17 VERSION.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This version is a fresh take on the older movie with Arnold. I liked the non-stop action. The characters weren't comical or cartoonish. There were some clever nods to the old movie (the lady at the checkpoint). Overall the movie was entreating, however the ending was way too simplistic which made me forget it almost immediately. I guess I may need a partial if not total recall in a couple of hours :).<br /><br />If you like lots of action and hot looking actors without too much of a plot line than you will probably enjoy this movie. As fake and silly as the old version looks today I think I still like it better though.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Wonderful addictive game! I thought I would check it out, it is rather easy to play. The dragons are adorable. Anyone can play!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|What is more fun than a fowl mouthed teddy bear? It was a great movie for just the two of us on a cold Friday night. It was extremely entertaining and exaggerated. So much fun!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Gave as a gift and they loved it.  Would recommend from what they described.<br />Great value, great music.  Thank  you.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|The only thing that didn't make us go crazy were the songs. We knew all of them. The people that sang them....were not very good....Well, maybe I am biased. I don't like musicals and have no interest in watching Glee. Sorry, people.
B00A757EFW|4.0|the joystick takes a little getting used to but overall I love it just as much as when I was a kid!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I expected a lot more because the original was pretty cool. If you have seen the original, then you might have the same feeling about. I wouldn't say that it was worth renting it, but if it were free, oh well, don't complain if it is free, right?
B002W5UVSM|5.0|Before reading this I was convinced that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Dr. Hunter S. Thompson was the funniest piece of English literature. I was mistaken. Next on my reading list is Joseph Heller's Catch-22. Read this and you will not be disappointed. May Fortuna smile upon you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book I think was a success Jeff Kinney I think you hit homerun on this book simply awesome  and amazing
B000000W5P|5.0|Really good album just put it on to review it and at the start I was dancing then setteled into relax mode really good album buy it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A thousand times yes. There isn't anything more that I can say except read this book. You won't regret it.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Great movie.  Not usually a Tom Cruise fan, but I liked him in this movie.  I was a teen in the 80's, so I can really appreciate the music and hair bands!
B003297I1U|5.0|My son LOVES this truck!!!! He has played with it a lot since the day he got it (25Dec2012). He is 7 years old. His favorite thing is the size of the crane. The first thing he described about it was, &#34;Daddy, the hook is made of metal!&#34;<br /><br />The truck is very sturdy, well built, detailed and BIG. I thought I would try this brand of trucks because of all the high ratings (it did not disappoint). I would highly recommend this product.
B0014KM8FK|5.0|Blue Streak is the gem of this collection. The other two films are very fun but Blue Streak is what makes this a must buy. If you love Martin Lawrence, then jump on this!! What are you waiting for? :P
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love the graphics;they are so cool. I like his ability were he web swinges. And you can get the Blake Suit but it's like 20,000 points.<br />All I'm saying is that it is fun.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|This a great follow up album, and it sounds really good for only being worked on since her debut this year in January.

B0063IH60K|5.0|i think this app is very fun and it gets addicting when you knowhow to play!  i own a kindle fire that makes the screen bigger and better to play with, i feel stupendous when i win!!!!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|This  was exactly what I needed and even came with instructions, as a refresher. The photo looked exactly like what it used to look like.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Probably the best camera app. Great price to value. I am loving this app slowly. Works like a charm  :-)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Not the best Connelly novel but still a good read.  All the books with detective Bosch are not to be missed.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Played this on steam and on my android device, great great game whether your a hardcore gamer or just want something to pick up and play. Just get it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Have loved listening to Susan Boyle ever since she had her first public appearance on television.  What a surprise she was to EVERYONE!!!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I expected a little more from the movie, but over all it was a well put together film. Theres constant action that keeps it from getting boring and of course the cast is awesome.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Action filled movie!!! Was a great buy for my son, for Christmas! If you love action movies, I highly suggest this one!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a cool game that insipires fun finger moving adventures moving rapidly and gets more intense as level increases
B001DPHDCY|4.0|I have two boys and they both really like this movie! They both at ages 4 and 12, love Dr. Suess books, and this movie was a perfect gift for them!
B005HSL626|4.0|its very atracting! but should put more stud to shop for and and levels! to make more ixiting and atracting and will get more fans:)
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I have seen so many animated movies, I was kind of iffy about this one!!! But I soon got hooked! It's a movie for the entire family!!!
B009329Y30|3.0|I think the book was much better but Zac Efron was definitely fun to watch in this movie. The Lucky One isn't one of Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers but it's still pretty good.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This is by far is my favorite Russel Crowe movie! WONDERFULLY written script, and a great choice of cast members.
B005LAII94|5.0|Great movie;couldn't wait to see it when the trailer came out. Met all my expectations. Never knew it was a book!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|WONDERFUL movie! I honestly can not think of one negative thing to say about this movie! Betty White was a nice addition to hear in this wonderful 'voice' cast!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a good game. if you have a few minutes to kill, then this is a good game to do. the one thing i dont like is once you get everything from the store it gets boring
B0064T6LV8|3.0|3 different pinball games with challenging speed and flipper levels make this a relaxing time-passer. It is worth the time and money spent.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|obviously, she's a hit.  her voice is great.  i find some of the tracks a little slow and can narrow down my favorites to a hand-full but this album was worth the purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I look forward to reading the other 2. Highly recommended for those who like to read fiction.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book I didn't want to put it down. Sparks has done it again with a great love story.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I missed this one in the theatres. The second one was rather underwhelming, and it's been so long that I wondered what the point was. And while Will Smith doesn't drive me nuts like some actors do (coughTomCruisecoughSethRogencough), I don't go out of my way to see every film he's in. Still, Tommy Lee Jones is always fun in anything he does, so...<br /><br />I was surprised that the film exceeded my expectations. A cranky alien escapes prison on the Moon, heads to Earth, and goes back in time to kill Agent K and make it possible for his race to invade the planet in the current day. Agent J follows him back, meeting the younger version of his partner, played by Josh Brolin.<br /><br />Jones' role in this film is more or less an extended cameo, while Smith is somewhat a fish out of water in the earlier time frame. The film starts off a bit slow, a story by numbers perhaps, which quickly changes once Agent J goes back in time. The story picks up pace, and Brolin as the young Agent K is uncanny in the role, playing the character as grumpy as Jones, but still giving new nuances to the character. Brolin was a mostly obscure actor for years, but in recent years is rightfully getting attention as his potential as an actor is being put to good use. The story ties into the moon launch mission, which provides for some unexpected laughs, and the CGI mostly works well.<br /><br />And oddly enough, a supporting character, an alien who can see potential outcomes of most any situation, provides some of the most poignant and funny moments of the film.<br /><br />If you were disappointed in the second film, give this one a try.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We all loved this movie.  I loved how it was of Irish tradition (a little outside of the classic) and I loved how head strong the princess was.  My son (6) watched it 3 times in the 48 hrs we had rented it.
B008RV5K4U|3.0|First half of an adaptation of the Miller and Janson graphic novel, telling the story of an alternate future Batman coming out of retirement, at some point in his fifties, to take up his cause again. Gotham City has changed in the ten years since he ceased his double life, becoming a haven for even more ruthless gangs than before, and Batman himself has become withdrawn and isolated. As in the original source material, I can see why it's so acclaimed, though it's not to my personal taste. The animation style is a mix of the look from the animated series with influences from the graphic novel. Miller's influence is clear throughout, with his personal misogynistic, pessimistic, and even nihilistic world view pretty much playing itself out. Definitely not for kids.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|My son and I absolutly loved the dancing in this movie.  My son (6) loved the way they incorporated the cars with hydralics into their first dance.  I love how they actually stand for something and win.
0399160450|1.0|Yet another disappointing Tom Clancy and company novel, all the more so because his older work was compelling. Jack Ryan Sr. is back in the White House again, confronting a crisis with an aggressive China trying to assert itself. Its tactics include military, economic, and cyber warfare, and the situation brings his son Jack Jr. and colleagues at the off the book group known as the Campus into the crossfire. Clancy continues to ignore his own continuity, something that he's been doing ever since Red Rabbit and Teeth of the Tiger. There are glitches and errors suggesting he and his co-writer don't care much about preserving that continuity, and instead put their emphasis into Clancy's new political stances, which have plagued the last few books. As usual, the book is too tech-heavy, with long descriptions of how things work, an obsession Clancy has always had. All in all, the new characters Clancy has developed in the last few books just aren't as interesting as those from older books, and his disregard for maintaining continuity is frustrating. He hasn't had a worthwhile book since The Bear And The Dragon, and that shows no sign of changing anytime soon.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|My husband loved this movie.  I only gave it 4 stars because I could have used a bit less gore to enjoy it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was written in a way so that every person who reads it can truly understand and relate to one event or character or thought in it. I finished in in a day because couldn't put it down. It's a great read for teenagers.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|It was a gift for my son who loves the whole package. I'm sure any Rolling Stone<br />fan would love it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I got this free, but I hate that every time I start to play I have to go thru the adverts.  Sorry not for me!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|liked the movie, it was enjoyable, but as always when we watch a movie from amazon it stops during the movie saying connection lost, we check our computer and have connection there so don't know why this happens once or twice everysingle time we watch a movie on amazon.  it doesn't happen that way with netflex
0545265355|5.0|Great series! Read them in one week!  Would have been faster but we all must work and earn a living.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I've watched it twice and will probably do so whenever I need to have my spirits uplifted. Fun, artistic, creative. A perfect antidote for escaping the craziness of the &#34;real world&#34;.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I can really relate to the situations in this book plus there was great details so that is why I gave it a five stars
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I've been a big fan of Lee Child and the Jack Reacher series since the beginning, until this latest effort. Although formulaic he did have a way of drawing you in on the first few pages and maintaining your interest throughout. To me, Wanted Man could have been written in his sleep. The same old stuff distilled into one lazy little book. The &#34;action packed&#34; finale was so confusing I had no idea what was going on. It's time Lee Child amped up his skill level a bit. Jack Reacher has become a caricature and it's time he evolved and developed some dimension. The larger than life loner with three days worth of clothes has become tiresome. If I was introduced to Lee Child for the first time in this book, i doubt if I would read another.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved the series, but kind of got lost in Christian and Ana's constant fighting over nothing towards the end. Was definitely surprised by Ana \\"breaking up\\" with Christian to save Mia. Nice twist!
B007SGM084|5.0|It is my best read so far. I love the story line I love love Christian and I wish I can can get more of his inner thoughts . Best erotica ever I will never get tired of this trilogy. Want more of of Christian and a movie would be great but I don't think it would do the book justice,because I know a lot of the best parts would be left out. Great read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is suspenseful and keeps you on your toes until the very end. Keeps you guessing the whole time. I recommend it to anyone.
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|Bought this toy for my 6 year old brother in the hopes of getting him off my phone (which he plays angry birds on). This one was a couple dollars cheaper than the knock on wood version, so I decided to go with this one. I now understand why. The pieces on this toy are impossible to build with. I found myself frustrated playing with the toy I couldn't imagine him. Perhaps dominoes may have worked better to knock down. He enjoys it, so that's all that matters in my book, but took off two stars for the company not thinking everything through.
B001LF347E|5.0|Having given this first season to myself as a Christmas treat, I sat down to watch the first episode yesterday. Nine episodes later I was still watching. I think the acting is superb. If you are on the edge of your seat worrying about characters getting killed that you know grow up to be adults then the actors have done their job. Usually in magical productions, the characters are much more two-dimensional. Here, you have real people, even with the magic. They make mistakes, sometimes what seems to be a good idea turns out to be a bad idea. I love the dragon (I like dragons) and John Hurt has done an excellent job (as always) with the voice. I love the scenery. 'Cheesy' is when they do everything on a sound stage - that's 'cheesy'. This production has plenty of scenes that expand out into the 'real world'. I like that I know the story so I know how these characters will turn out - turning this into a prequel of how it all came to be. Before I went to bed last night, I ordered season 2.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam continues to be a competent and witty spokesman for what (most) all modern free-thinking people have always thought and known about this and other related topics. I hope that his efforts encourage others to speak out and do their parts in dispelling these persistent myths that hold so many of our fellow beings enslaved. Uh, I have no idea why I just said that....but I think Sam knew that I would say it.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I finally watched the Dark Knight Rises today and I must say after 2 1/2 hours I felt unsatisfied with the movie. I was excited to see Bane take center stage in the film, but then at the end I was let down as it was revealed he was just a willing pawn in the whole Talia revenge scheme (though I loved his voice acting and accent). I was hopping for a Knightfall saga storyline, not a rehash of the first film's plot line. The Bane from the comics was very intelligent and never worked for anyone but himself. Plus he deduces Bruce's secret identity but in the movie the audience has know idea how or why he does so. Never in the film does Bane talk about eliminating Batman or admiring his skill and reputation as an equal to his own skill. In the comics, after staging multiple crime events to see Batman in action, Bane determines to fight Batman in order to see if Batman is a challenging an opponent as he appears to be. He wouldn't have willingly died in a nuclear blast. I didn't get the sense that he was a believer of Ra's manifesto. I know people will say it was because he loved Talia and was enabling her to carry out her late father's plans to destroy Gotham. But I say bulls*** to that flimsy excuse. Why would she sacrifice herself? As heir to the League of Shadows and Ra's legacy, her job should have been to strike at Gotham City first then the rest of the world as Ra's was an eco-terrorist whose ultimate goal was a world in perfect environmental balance. He believed that the best way to achieve this balance is to eliminate most of humanity, not blow your self up. So how does destroying herself, Bane and Gotham further that goal? What about her father's organization? Doesn't she care about his legacy? If she was in suicide bomber mode from day 1 why this long, drawn out 5 month bomb plot? Why not detonate it after making a statement to the world about how it's become corrupt and needs to be destroyed starting with Gotham (again why just Gotham). Instead she spends yearstrying to develop a clean energy reactor that can be turned into a nuclear bomb? Were there no bio weapons available to destroy Gotham with or other nuclear bombs? she needs to spend 8 years plotting to destroy Bruce? Since he was a recluse, couldn't she have gotten Bane to invade the manor and kill him a long time ago? Why didn't Lucious Fox flood the chamber after Bane forced him to activate the reactor? Why was she worried about detonating the bomb when she stabs Batman? Why didn't Batman immediately react and take her down when she stabs him? Instead he grimaces for 3 minutes while she reveals her identity. Since she knew exactly how little time was left on the clock why the rush to detonate it early? She waited 5 months, would another 15 minutes have made a difference? So the bomb doesn't remotely detonate, again with only 15 minutes left, why does she feel the need to get to the truck carrying the bomb and protect it? She sabotaged the reactor, so no one could use it to defuse the bomb anyway.<br />Next issue I had was how did Bruce become a cripple? I don't recall him been severely injured at the end of Dark Knight? Yes he fell with Harvey and was shot, but how did he lose all the cartilage in his knees? Why then the brace on only one knee? What about his shoulders and arm joints the doctor says are also shot? Why would he allow himself to get out of shape even if he wasn't Batman anymore? Plus how does a clearly unconstitutional law (due process anyone) stay enacted for 8 years? How many prisons would Gotham have needed to house all the criminals affected by this act? Just Blackgate? What about Arkham Asylum? Are we to assume that in this DC universe there are no other super criminals to take advantage of a Batman free zone (of course Catwoman is the only criminal still at large apparently)? We can have Batman imitators in hockey masks in Dark Knight taking down crime, but not Joker imitators in Returns causing it? Wasn't the point of Dark Knight that Batman sacrificed his good guy image to Dent in order to protect Gotham by being the bad guy? But then he retires right after? He saves Dent from the Joker, but then people assume he changed his mind and killed Dent later and thus allow the Dent Act to be passed because of that belief? Then he saves Gotham by somehow flying really fast past the 6 mile mark, drops the bomb and fly's another six miles to avoid the blast all in what, 2 minutes? No EMP or shockwave to deal with? Wouldn't an underwater explosion have been better for the city then an midair explosion?<br />Then Catwoman somehow strikes a love chord with Bruce as a fellow solitary solider and they live happily ever after even though she clearly sees him as the 1% and leads him into a trap with Bane rather then try to help him defeat Bane or just leave the city altogether. They had 2 1/2 hours to throw some extra scenes together expanding on this \\"relationship\\" with Catwoman that he somehow develops in the whole 10 minutes he spends with her. Batman would never align himself with a thief.<br />Next is the whole Bane subplot/motivation for blowing up parts of the city and keeping everyone a prisoner on the island. His whole French revolution ideology just grated me like fingers on a chalk board. Storm the Bastille. Strike down the rich and let the people (specifically criminals locked up by the Dent Act) exact their revenge on the evil rich people. Take from the rich. Redistribute the wealth that was stolen by the rich people and their greedy corporations. Socialism and free healthcare for all! All that was missing was the guillotine. They could have followed the No Man's Land storyline (which parts of this movieare based on) without the liberal social commentary about the poor, repressed 99% exacting their pound of flesh (figuratively and literally) from the evil bourgeoisie. What was his real motivation for dying with Talia? The whole anarchy angle seemed too out of character for him. He never explained to theaudience why he was doing all of this outside of his reciting the speech stolen from Gordon. How does causing a jail break do anything if you've got a nuke ready to go off anytime? I think a nuke trumps a puny jailbreak in order to punish the rich.  He's the head of the  (not Talia apparently) but wants to blow himself up with a nuke in 5 months. Huh? He allows Talia to lead him around by the balls while she spends years plotting her revenge on Bruce, so what's he doing in the meantime? He arrives back at the League of Shadows 8 years ago, has a police record (which the real Bane would never be so sloppy as to leave a trail for the police to follow) and has been doing what exactly?<br />The whole pacing of the film was off. Too much time jumping between scenes near the end. Too much disconnect between Bane and Batman. Bane breaks his back and a guy punches the vertebrae back into place and somehow he heals with days to spare. Why is Bane so strong? In the comics it's due to the Venom drug and his experience in hand to hand combat. When he's fighting Batman at the end and he punches holes in the marble pillars, how did he not break his hand/arm? Not even Batman could have done that. Where were Batman's gadgets during the two fights with Bane? No grappling hooks to gain the high ground? No smoke bombs to hide in the shadows? How does the police know about Bane but not Bruce? The whole prison scene flashback occurs 30 years ago so Talia has to be pushing 40 and Bane has to be pushing 60, but yet Bane seems very young and very strong for someone who suffered a massive beating and exposure to a plague. How does the mask keep the pain at bay? How did Batman not think to smash the mask during their first encounter? If you saw someone wearing a big respirator/mask and they were kicking the s*** out of you, wouldn't you try to dislodge the mask?<br />Lastly, how did \\"Robin\\" deduce Bruce was Batman from having met Bruce once a long time ago and recognizing Bruce had the samehidden pain that he had from losing his parents? From that Batman decides to reveal the hidden Batcave to him? Did he leave the Dummies Guide to Batman on the counter along with the keys to the Batmobile (where was that in the movie)? Meanwhile, with his city is in ruins, Bruce is frolicking with Selina in the French Riviera while some kid he just met has the run of the Batcave. Where did they get the money to live in Europe? He's okay living off funds from stolen property? What about Alfred? Is he helping out \\"Robin\\"? It took Bruce a decade training with the masters from the League of Shadows and his own highly rational mind and exceptional deductive skills to create the persona of Batman. Meanwhile the Dent Act is repealed, criminals are loose on the streets (where's the Joker), the city is going to have to depend on the rich to finance all of the billions of dollars in reconstruction, many of whom are dead or have left, the main benefactor of the city (Wanye foundation) is in financial ruins, Gordon likely loosing his job (though I fail to see how the passage of the Dent Act was his responsibility like \\"Robin\\" seemed to think so) and now Bruce decides his work is finished for real and that \\"Robin\\" can take up the mantle? A rookie cop with the legal name of \\"Robin\\" who possesses only basic police skills? Couldn't they have given him an actual character's name like Jason Todd or Tim Drake or Dick Grayson?<br />The whole movie leaves too many plot holes and unanswered questions and doesn't fit with the other two movies. The ending felt rushed and too convenient with the introduction of the bomb that no one could destroy or disarm. The movie was too long for as little as was accomplished as far as character development goes. I give it 2 stars out of 5.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun to play, I would recommend this version of Solitaire. It is addictive after a few games and fun to play on the Kindle Fire.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I resisted this for a long time because of what's missing but finally gave in and got it.*  Missing, of course, are \\"I Missed Again\\", \\"Don't Lose My Number\\", and \\"Do You Remember?\\", among several lower-charting hits.  But, at 74 minutes, there was probably only room for one more song.  I feel that \\"I Missed Again\\" should have been that song:  it was Collins' first solo hit and one of his best.<br /><br />Over time, \\"True Colors\\" pales even more in comparison to the other songs here.  However, it was hardly unusual to include a new song on a hits disc and it did become a sizable Adult Contemporary (and minor pop airplay) hit.<br /><br />What's here are the bulk of Collins' biggest chart hits through 1998 (\\"You'll Be In My Heart\\" came after this was released), and they are great.  This collects soundtrack hits from \\"Buster\\" (\\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\") and \\"White Nights\\" (\\"Separate Lives\\", a duet with Marilyn Martin).  It also includes \\"Easy Lover\\", the #2 duet with Philip Bailey, from Bailey's album \\"Chinese Wall\\".<br /><br />When these were hits, I was actually a bit resentful of Phil Collins' saturation airplay.  I couldn't understand why other pop/AC icons I enjoyed, such as Barry Manilow, Neil Diamond, and James Taylor, could barely dent the chart while Collins and Lionel Richie were played constantly.  Of course, this was a radio programming choice and had nothing to do with the artists.  I have grown to appreciate these songs more over time.  Phil Collins didn't look like your typical Top 40 pretty boy, and pulled off this string of hits with humor, class, and taste.  As of 2012, sadly, pop radio is as deaf to Phil as it was to the above stars back in the day.  This should have been a 2-disc set, with all Phil's 28 chart hits plus some LP cuts like \\"Like China\\" from \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\".<br /><br />*Now I see that there is an import 2-disc set that has most of the hits this is missing.  With the exception, oddly, of \\"Take Me Home\\".

She is a book reader, but did not even know that leather bound books existed!<br /><br />The book is beautifully bound with a wonderful forward explaining the history of these tales by Doyle.<br /><br />I would recommend this purchase for anyone who loves to read. It is a special treat to get a leather bound book and who does not love the Sherlock Holmes stories?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am new to the kindle fire and glad I can go on facebook right on my kindle fire anytime!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I must admit, I had no idea what the plot was of this book before I ordered it. I ordered it because of all the hype and because I was ready to start a new book. After the first couple of chapters, I found myself wondering when it was going to get good. I never read any reviews, but I was saying to myself what I have now read in negative reviews.  Okay, she meets this man.  He's too good to be true. He makes her stutter and weak in the knees.  Okay, I get it!  I got it 2 chapters ago... can we move on?  Well apparently not.  As I read on, I continued to find it going nowhere.  I also found myself not getting engaged in the characters.  In fact, I think they are rather unlikeable.  He started becoming a jerk when I thought maybe he'd soften. She just got more and more stupid.  For someone who had never been kissed, I couldn't believe that his playroom enticed her!  Not very believable.  Before wasting anymore of my time, I looked up and read a summary of the entire book and sure enough, it doesn't seem to go anywhere at all.  Then I began reading some reviews on here, and found that the negative reviews match exactly how I feel about the book.  I wish I'd read them before I wasted my money. I'm done. Putting it down and moving on to something better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like any card games and I like the way the cards play their selves also the size of the cards
B001QL5MAA|4.0|I love sci fi. That said this book is a really good book. I don't know what readers who don't read a lot of sci fi would think of this book, but as a fan of the genre I really liked it. My problem is that I've read so much sci fi that it is hard to find stuff that is original enough for me to enjoy. This book is an epic, well written,  and original enough to keep me reading. The only problem I had is the punctuation and grammar are a little off. It's not as bad as some kindle books I've read and I'll put up a lot for an interesting story anyway.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game is great and different once I start playing I cant stop I am going to down load more games from the kindle
1250010403|2.0|This is the first book I have read by this author, and although fairly well written by today's standards I was angry at being duped at the end by the ending being postponed until the new book comes out. The motive is obvious - to get the reader to buy the next book in the series. I bitterly resent being led to believe the book, while part of a series, would stand on its own. The story was fairly original but not all that well plotted; the characters were predictable and one-dimensional. At the very end, the outcome of the court battle, which is a main if not major theme in the story, is postponed until the next book comes out, i.e., the verdict, which we have been waiting for throughout the book, on the last page, in the very last sentence, we are told, is to be delayed until the next book in the series. I just could not believe his effrontery! I was astonished that such a well-known writer would stoop to such tactics. Maybe he's short of cash, or maybe just greedy - who knows, but he isn't getting another penny from me.<br /><br />I was going to buy the first as well as the third in the series since I liked the book well enough to pass a bitter winter's night. However, not only will I refrain from buying the other two books in the series, I will not be buying any more books from this author, who has such little respect for his readers in that he has no compunction in swindling them into buying another.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I find myself so wrapped up in this story. Not a literary marvel, but it pulls on some deep desire in is to be taken control of. It's definitely X rated Twilight.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great fun. As a senior I totally ignored all the stuff going on the year with games etc. as I play 7 wonders all the time to de stress. This will probably be my new &#34;go to &#34; game even though it's been out for a while.

Not only was this book completely spellbinding in its storyline, character development and oveerall execution,but the sheer originality of it is with out a doubt fantastic.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|As I mentioned in my review of the first book in the Beautiful Creatures Series, this is a stunning book destined to be a classic. Again, the South has won in this witty and naked presentation of a small town where ladies have bake-offs and your crazy aunt has her favorite pets sent to the taxidermy. Garcia's books are not to be missed and I eagerly look forward to the film adaptation. I can't wait to prance about theaters shouting, &#34;The book is sooooo much better!&#34;

0385344333|2.0|Like most of the reviewers I have read all of the previous teacher books and was anxiously anticipating this one.  Even after reading the reviews I thought maybe the reviewers were being a bit nitpicky or just taking out the really bad placement of Tom Cruise in the new movie on this book.  Surely after a good amount of time between books this one would be really good...right?<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />The book is readable and I read it to the end.  That is the only reason it gets 2 stars from me.<br /><br />The plot is awful.  Way too much time in the car and very little action throughout the book.<br /><br />Child mailed this one in while promoting a movie with a very short Reacher in it.  I hope that anyone who has picked this as their first book in the series to read gives the others a chance as they are really good.  Just don't picture Cruise as Reacher while you are reading as that is laughable at best.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|This has been one of my hardest and most enjoyable reads ever. It starts a little slow but this was my first e book so the formatting may have helped in that judgement. Once in I could not stop. Enjoy this read
B005ZUR724|2.0|So they finally released the update so we can play. Great! But in my Kindle Fire HD the textures are very low res. The UI looks scaled from a low res version of the game. Very disappointed. Its sad when on my lower res iPad 2 the game looks better. Uninstalling. Yep, it's that bad.

0808519387|5.0|Back in the mid-1960's, I read this book for pleasure and may have written a Book Report on it. Now I want to read it again to grasp what may have gone over my head back then. I also loved the movie with Gary Cooper and Patricia O'Neill and have it on DVD. I guess you'ld call me an Ayn Rand follower, except for her &#34;social&#34; atheistic leanings. She was an amazing woman!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this, but it was thoroughly entertaining from the get-go. The entire cast is very likable, and the music numbers were top-notch. It's a little racy in some spots, but I think most parents would be ok with older children. I would definitely watch it again. (For me 3 stars = worth watching once only, 4 stars = would watch more than once, 5 stars = would watch several times and/or purchase DVD).
0817439390|5.0|I like this book because it shows all different exposures and what each one will do. It explanes each exposures.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am pretty disappointed by many of the self published books on Amazon so was very pleased to find the Wool series compelling...great plot, real characters and it is leaving me hungry for more.  I have stayed up far too late two evenings in a row.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you get the finger flick down, it’s hard to put the game down.  I know I should be doing other things, but heck, this is my vacation time.  It’s challenging and a fun diversion.
B0096DZKZC|2.0|The app will not download!I love sonic but the stupid app keeps telling me to install it but when I click install it does the same thing over again.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is really fun! you get to draw your own stick man and go on adventures to save a friend that you draw and name! I would recomend this game to anyone! super fun game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really good game if you just want to have some fun relaxing time. It can get a little more challenging than it meets the eye as you advance.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is great and fun. however it requires Internet to play so u cant play it on the go. God bless u.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! Suzanne did a wonderful job writing this book. I watched the movie before reading the book which wasn't a bad thing but some things were a little confusing. I recommend reading the series. They are well written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game considers lots of brain and its very fun but may be addicting at times cool though
B009329Y30|4.0|I read the book first,I  loved it, and I thought the movie was good also. This movie is worth watching.
B0072OFM28|3.0|Without Whitfield, Spartacus is just not the same, even with the graphic novel-like violence.  Whitfield, as Spartacus, paid his dues.  The new actor does a decent job, but if you were a fan of Season I, you will be continually reminded of Whitfield's absence.  Additionally, the new packaging is poor: the discs slip into folders now, which increases the chances for more wear, in my opinion.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|for kindle fire, you are better off going to you tube from the silk browser to access google.  this app is marginally better than the you tube free app
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I downloaded this for my boys and they love it! We have it on two phones a tablet and our new kindle fire...we race to see who can get the most stars!  Awesome!!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|it's ok. I don't know how to end game when there's no more possibilities/moves. When i play on my pc, it automatically tells me &#34;no more moves&#34; and gives me the opportunity to end the game.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's not as funny as I thought it would be but it's still a good book you should buy it.
B000063UR2|5.0|Bought it for my friend, she loved the movie but didnt have it! Tom Cruise is mysterious and adventurous boy trying to save hte land.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No matter your age this book satisfies. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read that's hard to put down.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|The documentation said it would play Windows Media files, so I purchased it, but it will not play my WMA files meaning it does me no good to have it.<br />MM
B003ODIZL6|1.0|WHY WOULD READ THIS I'M 9 AND WENT TO THE END OF THE BOOK AND I COULDN'T FIND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
B0052T7IC2|5.0|The Ramones have an anarchic beauty that has yet to be beaten .Their raw pulsating energy is contagious  and their cellar of greatness can't be equalled . Every time I hear this album I feel a rush and it lasts more than one hit .
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A would recommend this book to anyone who  likes to read about mysteries and action packed thrillers . I've seen every episode and read every comic it's amazing.
B0099TJ4YQ|2.0|If you have Taylor's 2004 Christmas CD, don't bother with this one. Ten of the 14 songs are exactly the same. My son got this for me for Christmas. I was excited at first to have a new Taylor album; then totally disappointed when I played it. How do people get away with marketing an album as new when it isn't? It reminds me of drug companies who tweak a patented drug, and then proclaim that it's something brand new - just to make a buck. I'm very disappointed in James.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was perfect, the perfect amount of drama, action and intensity! The love triangle with Katniss Gale and Peeta was great!
B0076DELIG|2.0|I am a member of the Harry Bosch Fan Club. However, this book was a major disappointment. I have tried three times to finish the book yet become bored to tears within a few pages. Good grief Harry, spice it up a little will ya?! I do keep the book handy on my Kindle though. It's guaranteed to put me to sleep within minutes of picking it up.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is the most amazing book in the world we'll thats what I think.<br /><br />By Jacob noonkesser to the most amazing book lovers
B009WO7NQO|5.0|He really enjoyed Star Wars Angry Birds in HD Kindle Fire that he got for Christmas.  He can't wait for the second part of Hoth that's coming soon.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It rocked can't wait till next one!!!!!I also can't wait until movie to I love Jeff Kinney books he rocks!!!!#
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My son enjoys this free Angry Birds Space.  He has played it on other types of tablets and really liked this on his Kindle Fire.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I'm a 66-year old Taylor fan and this adds more tunes for me to enjoy.  Her more mature music styles in Red are a welcome positive progression. I hope Taylor continues to mature and provide us with more listenable songs and continuing  pleasure being the fan of such a well-adjusted young person, especially considering how hard it must be to maintain her values and beliefs.
0307744434|1.0|It's not really fair of me to say I hated this book because I hated this book from page 1 through the bitter end.  I should have stopped reading (I thought about it a lot) but I kept going because somewhere a while back I read, \\"If you like Water for Elephants, you will like this book.\\"  Well I loved Water for Elephants and I hated this book.<br /><br />I did not like the plot which is that two kids are treated really meanly by adults because they are in some sort of competition with each other that even they cannot know about.  They grow up, do their magic in a night circus, fall in love and meet some other dull characters along the way. But the challenge! The challenge!  It's all so important and they have no idea what it is!  Ugh, I could have cared less about of any of them.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I finished It so fast I could  not put it down !!!!!!<br />I can't wait to read the next one !!!!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a fun read, with lots of excitement and an ending I didn't see coming.  Well done!! Would love to see more by this author.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|A very sad experience. Do not waste your money or time viewing this over rated movie.  You would be better off watching mickey mouse.
034580404X|5.0|Very steamy sex scenes, and wonderful love story made this a very nice read. I would recommend it to adults only and remember it is only fiction.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Not the best of Riordan but still a thrilling tale. They tend to set up for multiple adventures simultaneously and all but one get skipped.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I am definitely a fan and I love that it blu-ray and dvd. What else can I say.....it's The Vampire Diaries...yum
B0085YNML2|4.0|Munch is adorable, and I love the little face he makes when he eats the grub.  The game play is good and visually appealing, but the levels can get quite challenging, which is a bit of a frustration at times.  Overall, a great game that I highly recommend!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great addition to my devotional time. I love it because I can read it or listen to it.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I like the sound of this cd. Some songs are ones I'm unfamiliar with, but that will be untrue with time. If you like Taylor Swift, I'd recommend the cd to anyone.
0345803507|1.0|I applaud these books for being so open about taboo subjects, and for giving us something sexy to keep at the bedside.  However, what the minority of reviews for this book have said is true:  writing riddled with errors, mundane dialogue, weak/juvenile heroine that was impossible to connect to, repetitive plot twists (do they REALLY have to have sex every three pages???), absolutely NO real conflicts...  This book was an excellent Cinderella story with an absolutely SEXY male protagonist that woman or gay-man would at least have a one night stand with - because only a doormat like Ana would actually marry this guy.  However, I feel like this series should have been one book!  After the end of part 3, I felt like I wasted my life and money on Parts 2 and 3.  I will not be picking up anymore books from this author and I would only recommend this book for women who have nothing better to do.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is great for all ages! It has a lesson for all to learn from!! :) my kids love it!!
0451232852|5.0|I have not had time to sit down and read this book because of the busy Christmas Season, but I am looking forward to a<br />nice read.
034580404X|4.0|Agood quick read, very sexy. My wife is just starting to read it.Do not lat under 12 year old kids read - but make sure your 20 year old  does
0525952926|5.0|I am looking forward to reading this book as time allows.  At Christmas time there is little leasure time to sit down and enjoy one of my favorite Authors.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I read as a writer to hone my craft, so imagine my disappointment in Alice Munro's latest collection of short stories.  The stories were similar in describing relationships that are devoid of feeling.  One after another, Munro presents a sanitized man-woman couple whose connection is  motivated by opportunism.  A man hides from his life by hooking up with an older woman who needs a handyman.  He spends years living with her and fixing up her home until she falls ill and her medical care takes him to a new place where he leaves her for a job doing similar work for an apartment house.  His life goes on without a backward look.  Only the autobiographical writings reveal  glimpses of real people.  Ms. Munro should write in the first person and provide her readers with flesh and blood characters with whom we can empathize or at least find interesting to follow.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I was expecting more.  Tried emailing a couple of the notes and they didn't go.  Found that I couldn't copy and paste, which was really a hassle.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice has been a great training tool in preparing my Hospice volunteers to sit with Alzheimers and patients with dementia! They are very touched and empathic after reading this story!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have never played this before but heard everyone talk about it. I gave it a try and now I'm hooked.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the Battery HD app for my 1st gen. Kindle Fire! It is very useful and I use it every day.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun, fun to play.  great way to pass time while waiting for Dr's app't!! or standing in long checkout line
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is fun,  challenging,  and all around good time killer. I've. been playing for a couple months,  and each level I successfully beat,  the next is even more fun. highly recommended!
B004C3DLJS|4.0|its a sweet touching film. I watched it with my little brother he's 7. He seemed to really enjoy it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Halfbrick has never disappointed me. And I have to say, it continues to hold its everlasting streak! Its extremely addictive and fun! I love to shop for new jetpacks but earning coins isn't that easy. All in all, this game......... IS FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!!!!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I'll pretty much watch anything starring Johnny Depp with a dash of Tim Burton for that Gothic weird comedy. I don't think its appropriate for a child to watch but its good for teens and up.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie was just ok.  There were some really funny moments but overall, I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre.  The story was not well written and the highlights were just some quirky music puns that got old after being repeated several times.  I'm a big fan of Glee, mostly for the musical arrangements and this movie fell short there as well.  if it had some great musical moments, i could have overlooked the mediocrity.  I don't think I would pay to rent this again.  I'd probably just wait until it came out on HBO or something.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Batman was hardly in this movie. It was confusing and ridiculous. I thoroughly enjoyed all the other Batman movies - NOT this one!
B00063F8B2|5.0|This CD is a must have if you own a Lionel Train Polar Express set and want background music playing while the train is moving. The songs are a little out of movie order, but they are great none the less!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Exxon Mobil, Haliburton, Dick Cheney et. al., still destroying America.  Recently, 3 major university studies attempting to prove fracking was not harmful have been discredited.  This film fulfills it's main purpose in all respects, primarily raising awareness to the dangers to human life, animal life and the planet due to fracking.  And, it's all about money.  Excellent film exposing the failure of departments of environmental quality and even some congressmen.  So, what's new?  I saw it, now I'll buy it and make sure all my grandkids see it.
1451695195|2.0|I bought this book because it was written by a doctor and felt as such, his scientific approach would ligitimise his experience.<br />First of all I respect the fact Dr Alexander has put his credibility on the line here and I have no doubt he had an experience whilst in a coma that was profound for HIM.<br />These experiences are subjective of course and until one experiences their own (NDE etc)I feel there will always be an element of doubt for most of us. Humans are wired to be sceptical and we like to scrutinize and analyse the facts ad nauseum to find the \\"absolute proof\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no \\"proof\\" in this book. Furthermore I have no wish to spend eternity in the places Dr Alexander visited \\"beyond the veil\\".<br />The \\"muddy realm\\" from which he escapes each day to visit The Gateway and the Core, puts me in mind of an experience described to me by a friend who had taken Ketamine (anaesthetic drug also used in ICU) at a party in his foolish youth. Almost identical in fact.<br />The Gateway..........riding on a butterfly wing with a beautiful girl? Sounds more like a scene from Fantasia than a spiritual experience. The Golden Orbs flying overhead (apparently for eternity) embodied in glorious celestial music and joy is not the way I want to live forever. As for the Core...... well maybe there are no words that can satisfactorily describe this profound experience but I felt let down anyway.<br /><br />I would also like to say that Dr. Alexander's illness was dramatised just a wee bit. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the fact that Dr. Alexander called for divine intervention with an endotracheal tube down his throat. One is unable to talk with a tube and anyway one would hope he had a bit of sedation on board while they intubated him as he was obviously still conscious at that point.<br />Also the meningitis he survived was described as a miracle and a further miracle he had all his faculties in place after the event which was only sevendays.<br />Not such a miracle really. I have nursed (I am an ICU nurse) my share of meningitis patients and one just last year comes immediately to mind. Diagnosed with bacterial meningitis (streptococcus Mileri) he was in a coma for 60 days before he showed ANY response whatsoever. In fact he was moved out of ICU with tracheostomy still in place once off the ventilator and nursed on the ward. He returned to a fully conscious state slowly with all his faculties intact. He had NO Near Death Experience and remembers nothing after his admission through ED.<br /><br />I feel rather bad writing such a negative review about this book because I do believe Dr Alexander did experience something wonderful but it just wasn't conveyed in a convincing way. Not to someone like me anyway who wants to believe but has some difficulties at times.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very good game would recommend to anyone who loves hidden object games . Very good graphics as well, kept entertained all day .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing!!! From the first line to the very last it enraptured me!! Usually books are predictable especially romance novels but this book  contingent the surprises coming. This book has romance, adventure and mystery. You will fall in love with the main characters and root for them to find their way!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|this is not anything like season 1.  it is much more disturbing in a mental psychotic way... not with ghosts and such.  however... there are some things that are not either.  a great period piece of creepy and history.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|because I can't download it in my new kindle fire to allow me to install Adobe flash player, then I really need this software to each sometimes some channels tv like CNN when I am outsite. therefore,  I request your help to use as I want my wonderful kindle fire.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, not for kids at all, adults only, funny, great movie, must see
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is fun and worthy of your time. If you are on a car trip this app can help pass time. You will love it!
0307744434|5.0|I love it when I find a book that is just about impossible for me to put down. It doesn't happen often, but this was one of those books. I will say that it was a bit draggy in the  beginning, but nothing to make me want to put the book down, and the shifting of time can be a little confusing at first, but I quickly caught onto it. The book seemed to draw me in and by the end I was sorry the book was not longer. I would recommend this book to my friends and anyone who loves a good fantasy read.
0812992784|5.0|As always, Rushdie does a wonderful job.  Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would highly recommend it to others.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|This is a compelling, intriguing album.  The live show is striking, too, even though (where we sat) the sound was a bit muddy--so I toyed with saying that this album was better than the live show.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everybody should read the series! Not a fairy tale ending at all. Collins did a amazing job with this final book!! :)
B000YHE4AG|3.0|If you are a Will Farrell fan, then you will love this movie.  It's pretty silly, with a few moments of actually being funny.  My kid likes it more than I do and that is why I bought it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|You will love it if you love star wars!! :) feel of both angry birds and star wars! Each bird like a person out of the movies!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|Love JJ Had the cd but daughter swiped it. Seen him in concert he's awesome cd or in person!!!!  Thank you!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|We liked the movie, lots of action. I would recomend watching the previous movie first and it will make more sence. That is the reason for 4 stars. We have seen all the Bourne movies but it had been awhile and we should have watched the previous Bourne movie so we did not have to try and guess what was happening.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie! It's fun and it has a very thoughtful message! Merida is a courageous girl that fights to get her goals and fix her mistakes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey!  So glad Amazon offers past seasons for people to view and enjoy!
0547884591|5.0|The 4 Hour Chef is an amazing book. Cooking is just the project choosen but the real grit of the book is in approach to living and learning. We all spend nearly 2 decades in school learning subject material that is often forgotten within months. Never are there classes on HOW to learn and HOW life works. And yet we spend our entire lives living and learning... no wonder we make such a muck of it!<br /><br />Thank you Tim for spending the time and the love putting this together. You've reinspired me. I picked back up the 4 Hour Workweek and am revitalizing my business first... and soon some awesome culinary masterpieces of living. Rock on!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Did not want to stop reading!  I felt like I could feel what Charlie was feeling and that I was right there with him throughout the whole book. Definitely recommend this to anyone, I feel there's no particular audience and that anyone of any age could enjoy this. Five stars!

0792844890|5.0|I bought it for a Christmas gift for one of my brothers that like movies that Mel Brooks stars in.
B001AITH50|3.0|My husband told me i needed to watch it, so i rented it, the movie is okay...the quality was good though.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|kind of a basic combo of da Vinci code for book lovers in the era of Facebook and google kids.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|great, i really love the movie that's why i gave it 5 stars. you should check it out for yourself
0812993357|4.0|Like so many people, I was charmed by Grace Coddington and the imaginative work she does for Vogue when I saw \\"The September Issue.\\" Coddington is primarily a visual artist and not a natural writer. This is a girlishly written book, but not without interest.  The book is best when she writes about her early life in Wales and working as model in London and Paris during the late fifties and swinging sixties. The book held less interest to me when she wrote about the eighties to the present. The best part of the book are the photographs of her and the intriguing fashion spreads she creates for Vogue. Coddington herself comes across as an amiable woman who appears to hold few grudges and has a gift for surviving in a ruthless profession. At the end of the book, she writes about herself as an aging woman in a refreshing way. She wears no makeup except lipstick and sees no need to have cosmetic surgery. Coddington is a brilliant, self-invented woman whose true self comes across not in her writing, but in her work.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This game is such a great continuence of the series, I used to play the Bloons TD on the computers at my school when I was bored. This new one is very fun and much much more challenging then the other ones.I love almost every aspect of the game, especially the new towers. If you've never played Bloons TD then it'll be such a great game for you to waiste your time on.<br /><br />A few drawbacks are the fact that on my Kindle Fire HD I have to keep going to the store to buy the app again, it's not charging me but it won't stay on my screen on my kindle if I exit it for too long.<br />Another drawback is that it's practically impossible to get passed level 70. There's just to many bloons to pop with what you can build.<br />The levels are a little slow up to 30, but that's more of to be expected.<br /><br />Other than that it's a amazing game and I suggest it to anyone who needs another game to use their spare time on.<br /><br />(Will 5 star once it actually stays on my Kindle)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|you can only view so much then it cuts you off...it doesn't update but once. they really need to fix that
B003XMAD3G|5.0|Great upgrade, no probs so far. Used it for a lenovo s10-3s notebook! Paired with ssd, gives a lot of raw power...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Here are my 20 mandatory words.Good product would buy again.Here are my 20 mandatory words. Good product would buy again.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|The movies surprised me, I didn't think it would be this good. But Joseph Gordon-Levitt kills it in this movie.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Puzzles can't be saved to be finished later. puzzles disappear. Puzzle pieces are difficult to manipulate, sometimes don't respond to touch.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Very good foundation in which to get started in the right direction.  To change a company from just getting by to a very successful company .  I will have all my mangers read this.
0316069434|5.0|Ignore any negative reviews.  If you are a fan of this series you will love The Black Box.  This is the type of book that got me hooked to this series in the first place.  Great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was such a great book that it made me feel infinite;) it was so touching that it gave me chills, so much fun that it made me laugh, and sometimes I'd read it and just cry because it felt right. I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this! the first night we couldn't put it down. so addi ting. some puzzles are really hard. I like how you earn bonuses for different things.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|funny and just like real life for a oddball middle schooler like greg heffely . brings out the truth about midfle school.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It is exactly what I expected and of course<br />at a great price  Some how I had lost the original<br />cable for charging -- so I was glad I could<br />replace it with a quality cable<br /><br />SA in SF
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was shear genius. I connected greatly to this book it's a really good coming of age book. My only criticism is that young children or tweens shouldn't read the book. It is very graphic during certain parts and although my sister is 15 I still felt they book was a little mature for her but other than that it was a great book.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Keeps my i5 2500k stock at 27c idle, 46-48c under load. Fan is quiet. Why would you need anything other than this?
B008EL4YX6|1.0|The game is free, therefore there must be ads, right?  But not FULL SCREEN ADS before/after each level!  Not FULL SCREEN VIDEO ADS, ok?  Not 1990's-style banner ads ON THE GAME SCREEN!<br /><br />This might be the coolest game ever, I never went past level 2 to find out.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This movie was awesome I have been tring to find this movie every sense it came out. I like how they documented there experiences and testing of ther new powers. What intriged me most were the effects that took place as a result of there power. the graphics were amazing. I recommend  this movie to anyone who believe that man can accomplish great things
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The Perplexus Epic was a big hit with the family. We gave it to our two grandsons and it has ended up in the adults hands numerous times since.  Great skills and concentration game.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved this book! I started reading it, and I just couldn't put it down. I got the Kindle version, and I am so glad I did because I was able to read it right away.<br /><br />This book is full of imagination and magical lands that grabs your attention. When you start reading, you realize have to know what happens to Sophie and what kind of curse Calcifer and Howl are under. As you progress further into the book you want to know what is up with the creepy Scarecrow, why the Witch of the Waste acts the way she does, and what happened to the dog/man.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes imaginative writing and fantasy, because this book is full of it. Yes, it is different than Hayao Miyazaki's film adaptation, but both are great, in my opinion. Plus, right now the Kindle version is only $2.00! So it is a great way to spend $2.00, and even if you don't have a Kindle, you can read it on your computer.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|Movie is fun to watch, not great but good, Acting is so so but on a cold night can add enjoyment.
B004WR125O|5.0|Nice option for my onkyo 717 receiver.  Adds plenty to my listening needs.  Good streaming with no drop offs or loss of reception.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Insightful. Introspective. No holds barred collection of essays.  You know thse odd or cringe- inducing thoughts you keep to yourself? Sedaris puts his on paper. Warning: you WILL laugh out loud. Repeatedly!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Got this on the Gold Box Deal of the Day. $1.99 for the whole album, you can't beat the price.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great to play when travelling.  The graphics are awesome.  I play a lot of puzzle games, and this one is one of the best I have played in a long time. I would recommend this game for all of my friends.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great action flick. Love all the Bourne movies. Can't wait for the next one. hopefully with Matt Damon back in action.
B00A2LOAKI|3.0|When adapting any sort of written or illustrated work into a film, you can never please everyone.<br /><br />That being said, I think the best outlook when watching these sort of adaptations is they SHOULD make you WANT to go and read (or re -read) the source material.<br /><br />TDKR was enjoyable, and made me crack open my well worn copy of the graphic novel.  While the movie has its flaws, it made me appreciate the original that much more.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Good movie with great scenery, I have been to Venice twice and loved seeing it again in the movie. Johnny Depp & Angelie Jollie were terrific. Fun movie.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Good movie for kids of all ages also kept adults entertained.  Good storyline that wasn't the typical princess storyline that kids have received for decades.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down and had to start the next one right away.  I suggest this to anyone, you won't be disappointed.
B009ERK1T0|2.0|Deftones are one of the best bands ever, and I've been a fan from the beginning.  That being said... I didn't like this album.  I'd compare it to how Linkin Park sounds now vs. when they were actually a badazz rock band (1st 2 albumns).  This album is very soft, as soft as Chino's waistline, and when it does rock, the songs don't sound that good.  The slow stuff on prior albums is much better than these tracks.  Swing and a miss.  I HOPE this isn't the way they're going from now on.  More \\"Around the Fur\\" (or any other album), less of this.<br /><br />...and don't give me any \\"they're maturing and don't need to be heavy anymore to be a good band\\" b.s.  That's a cop out.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, in a few years when I'm attending yet another Deftones concert, I highly doubt they'll play ANY tracks off this album.  I'll put money on that!

As a male reader, it was an enjoyable read to view this story through the lens of what we call in the south a \\"steel magnolia.\\"<br />This book by Emily Giffin contains the charm and sweetness to a tale of overcoming the challenges of living and making you realize that tough times never last but tough people do.<br /><br />By Dr. Wilson Trivino
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|LOVE IT. ALWAYS HAVE. ALWAYS WILL. I've reread this series over eight times, and it never gets old. I get Soooooooooooooooooooooo emotionally connected to the characters each time I read it! I read about one book every two days, and I have yet to come upon a series that even closely compares to the Hunger Games trilogy. In a way, I wish Prim wouldn't have died, but then Katia wouldn't have shot coin, and then where would we be? She should branch of of the epilogue!!!!!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|During the summer, the kids and I went to a outside theather for a church.. We liked this movie. So my son now ownes it and can't wait to watch it
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved the emotions the book took me through, the suspense, and the end was a huge relief but there were a few scenes that made me roll my eyes and seemed really out of place to me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is such an addicting game. My girls love it and it does take some strategy. They also keep coming up with new ones so it never gets old.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|whatever! could not believe that there is so much hype for this game. do not pay for it ever ever.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never disappoints. Loved the plot twists with the kidnapped agent and reintroducing Louie Gould. Also liked the dressing down  of the FBI jerk.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I will learn the songs eventually.  Keys would be nicer if the colour were brighter. it should include more songs.
B002UEW31I|1.0|I can't think of enough adjectives to describe how utterly disappointed I was with this film. I'm the biggest Tarantino fan out there, and this film was complete garbage compared to his earlier work. I wouldn't have known it for a Tarantino film unless told otherwise beforehand. They say a writer should &#34;write what they know&#34; ~ and Tarantino obviously doesn't know anything about Nazis. Or WWII. Or France. He needed to stick to Compton. That, he knows. The sets in this movie looked like the back lot at Paramount circa 1950. The interiors looked like they used cast off set pieces from an off off off Broadway production of Disney's Snow White or a high school production of &#34;The Producers.&#34; And the worst? A jarring and completely irrelevant cameo by Mike Myers, doing Mike Myers doing a cross between Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. Eli Roth chewed the scenery like it was canned ham and looked like he got lost on the way to an episode of Jersey Shore. Brad Pitt was BRAD PITT throughout the entire movie. A funny haircut and jutting jaw does not qualify as acting. I can see why Chrisoph Waltz won such acclaim for his portrayal of the SS officer ~ he was the only shining spot in a turd stew. Tarantino once seemed to care about getting the details right ~ now he just seems to care about &#34;getting this bit on film&#34; and forget about authenticity, like he thinks we won't care, because he's Tarantino and can do no wrong. Well, I'm here to tell you ~ the emperor has no clothes, people ~ and I'm not afraid to say it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game! if you can, go to my world (Starlight Dreams Land). my house isnt a shelter. its a freakin fortress. oh and i have question for anyone one who can answer. doez it ever become night time? i wanna see some monsters!
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Mulan doesn't exactly listen to her folks but she tries to do the right thing and she has very strong family ties. She joins the Army in her father's place and ends up being a hero of China. It's not at all historically or culturally accurate but at least there's no wedding at the end of this Disney flick. It's nice that there is a strong female character in the female Disney lineup and the songs are great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. Highly recommended. Unlike others I will not give anything away about it. I will say though that I does have a little of  everything. Enjoy!!!!!!!<br />I can't wait for Colleen's new book and sequel to Hopeless \\"Losing Hope\\"
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I really like the songs that are included on this soundtrack for Nashville.  If you like the TV show and enjoy the music, then I would highly suggest the soundtrack.  I wish that all the songs had been included, but I'm sure there will be ways to find them in the future.  As always, Amazon had the best price!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Very exciting book . I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to next book. Lincoln Child is great writer. Douglas Preston has excellent foresight.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|same problem as everyone else. will only load about 10 posts on newsfeed. seems like this has been an issue for several months now.
B009329Y30|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie. It was a perfect love story. It showed the life in the central US perfectly - so different from life in New York.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is like the fast food of literature, you know it wont apport that much minerals and vitamins like real food to your body but you still eat it and keep eating because all this fat and sugar becomes adictive lol. It´s very explicit so i don't recommend it for underage kids. It is not for everybody that´s for sure I wouldn´t recommend it to my mom for example. It is for very open minded and grown up people. I like the use of lenguage, it is so light, if you are not used to read you can start with this trilogy, and if you are used to, you can easily finish every book in one or two days. I´m not used to read this kind of books, I prefer classics of literature, but I´m glad that I listened to my bff and buy it, it gives you perspective of the world that we are living.
B000001E18|5.0|Love this cd, trying to rebuild my collection. And this is a must have.<br />Arrived in great shape and on time.
1423140605|5.0|The book arrived in good time for Christmas and was packaged good.  It was new and in excellent shape.  I was very happy with it.

B0031ES8P6|5.0|this is the general &#34;beanie baby&#34; size.  Daughter loved it.  the outfit actually looked more pink (like hot pink) than pinkish - purple, which was fine for us.
B000069AUI|5.0|Love this cd, trying to rebuild my collection. And this is a must have.<br />Arrived in great shape and on time.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I've found that the material mirrors most \\"communication techniques\\" classes, which are offered through my place of employment.  The conversation starter suggestions were a bit laughable.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Not my favorite Van Morrison Cd but very good and relaxing.<br />I would recommend it, especially if you're a Van Morrison fan.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I purchased this movie for my niece as a present  and she loved it. Thank you very much for it.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Love this cd, trying to rebuild my collection. And this is a must have.<br />Arrived in great shape and on time.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|Very modern, no holds barred family story.  I've shared this movie with a number of friends--even gave it as a Christmas gift.  Plus the setting in Hawaii with Hawaiian music in the soundtrack was outstanding. Enjoy!
B000001DTM|5.0|Love this cd, trying to rebuild my collection. And this is a must have.<br />Arrived in great shape and on time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really like this game.  A lot of bells and whistles and it's great fun.  Try it, I think you will like it.
B000002LOE|5.0|Love this cd, trying to rebuild my collection. And this is a must have.<br />Arrived in great shape and on time.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone its a great movie!! And it came in a timely manner and it was in pretty good shape.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I have been enjoying this game and have been engrossed with the simple easy to learn game play, literally picked it up in less then 5 minutes and rich graphics and story
B004SEUJ82|4.0|It tells a story we should never forget. My best friend when I was in the 5th. grade was from Germany, he told me about the horrific things that were done to the German people.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|This movie is the shiz! A great story that differs from normal zombie type movies that is full of awesome FX and twisted humor.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great book cannot wait to read the next one! It provides interesting historical detail which as a history major I enjoy.
B00009YXHN|4.0|Love the sick and twisted mind of H.P. Lovecraft!!! Oh yeah! For sure a great addition to your gore DVD library.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Growing up Pac man was an all time favorite and to be able to play it on the go make it 100 x better my son even like playing it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Just an ok book, The book is porn without pictures. It could not keep my attention.  I got bored with it quickly
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Nice story of overcoming adversity, and learning to trust.  Not too.  Treacly, makes me wish I had a flower dictionary.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love this app! It actually sounds like rain and thunder and wind without sounding like static or having cheesy feel good music mixed in. I use it all the time to sleep. Not only are the sounds great, but the high level of customization is fantastic. If I could I would give it more stars!
B004QMRHHW|5.0|I am a big Amon Amarth fan and this album is very good.  I am interested to see what they might do next.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really enjoyed this fun and easy game to play. It is very additive and keeps you up late at night!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is such a good movie.  I am from Boston and now live in Texas so it was great to see some of the places I grew up around.  Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth McFarlane are awesome!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun and interesting . i also have a few different accounts! Loving it<br />it does.need more.options for the friends!
1400086035|5.0|Love any thing Jim Dale reads. He really brings the stories to life! My kids really enjoyed this as well.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I choose to rate this a book four stars instead of five because sometimes I felt that it was too repetitive. But that was the only possible thing that I could think of that was bad about this book. It was the most interesting book I have ever read it really made me think. The kind of thinking that requires you to put the book down and think about what you've read and what it means. I would recommend this book to any high school or college student.enjoy
0545265355|5.0|I didn't buy my copies from Amazon, but I try to leave reviews here because this is my favorite book source.<br /><br />Hunger Games, all three installments, is a frightening yet engrossing survival story following Katnis Everdeen.  The first book introduces readers to the Hunger Games, an annual event in which 12-18 year old children from the formerly rebelious districts are pitched against eachother in a deadly competetion in which only one contestant is allowed to survive.  Truly horrifying is that if the players aren't entertaining enough, the gamemasters stack the odds against them with booby traps, weather, and genetically modified animals (vicious and tenacious).<br /><br />The second book throws un unexpected twist in the lives of the districts, which I don't even want to mention at a high level.  The whole book is a spoiler.  A good mix of tragic, heroic and ridiculous characters keep the story fresh.  I highly recommend continuing the trilogy.<br /><br />The third book wraps up all of the major plotlines and once and for all settles who Katnis will end up with.  The story shifts away from the hunger games as true rebelion goes into full force.  Will they succeed?  If so, what will they do with their new power?<br /><br />Books one and two are my favorites, but three is vital to the story, so I recommend getting all three at once.  You won't want to wait for the next one once you've started.<br /><br />One word of caution, this story is filled with violence, tragedy and horrific acts by and against children.  If you are getting this for your kid, read it yourself first and consider what your kid can handle (and what you'd want your kid to handle).  I'm a middle aged woman, I like it, but I'm not sure I'd let my 13 year old son read it.  Maybe in a few years.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Many of my favorite musicians of all time are on this lineup. The songs were great. Each song was really different than the song before, very eclectic. I enjoy listening to it very much!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love it,best game since jewel star. Fun fast paced game. Can't put it down fun,fun,fun. Great game for being free.
0545128285|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  She began reading it immediately.  She is a huge JK Rowlings fan!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It does not get interesting until the last 50%.  I almost stopped reading at 30%.<br />Not up to author's previous standards.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Very affordable external mic for the price.  Shipped quickly and was just what I was expecting from the retailer.  Thanks.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My wife ordered this and loves this series better than the first one. However she didn't like the third one so we didn't buy that one at all (Netflix is the best for that particular one)...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun to play. I really enjoy a nice game after a long day. It has always s been one of my favorite games.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Much more action than the first movie. This one however, should have been called Mission &#34;Yeah Right&#34;. Many over exagerated moments...
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I liked Fruit Ninja because it gives you the chance to have fun dicing fruit, but not having to have any skill in the kitchen.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Great beginnig to get you hooked. This is my wife's favorite Vampire show (for now) and I am just supporting her on it...
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun and enjoyable game, but sometimes it ducks instead of jumps and you can end up crashing into a tree branch. However, I still consider very exciting.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This is the better Mission Impossible movie. Not just because it's the latest, but because it has the best action than all 4 movies.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Interesting writing style but not a fan of the ending didn't like the way Aunt Helen turned out but liked all the cultural references
B005URRCUY|5.0|Don't be fooled by the cheesy cover art, this album rocks! Turn it up loud and be pleasantly engulfed in heavy bass and melodies that will leave the trunk thumpers wondering.
B000002KDM|5.0|There have been many reviews done on J.T. but since I know him since about 1970 wh when met at a jazz festival in Monterey, I thought I would say a few words.<br /><br />I have loved his songs since he first came out with \\"Sweet Baby James\\" in 1969. The man is quite simply a genius at his genre, while I am quite good as a jazz guitarist.<br /><br />I can't say much more, except that my favs on this album are \\"Love has brough me around,\\" \\"You've got a friend,\\"Mud Slide Slim\\" \\"Riding on a railroad\\" & just about every tune on the CD. J.T. must feel good about this album, because he called me & sent it to me when it first came out. I think it was on LP then, but, in any case I have it on CD now.  Thank you for reading my review.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|I'd been listening to these guys for a long time and had no idea who they were! Turns out that the Black Keys are a bit low key, but this is an excellent album that can be listened to all the way through and left on repeat. Fantastic!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an easy game to play on my tablet and it's fun to play the winning deal because even though it's a winning hand, if you don't play it right, you won't win.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Excellent album, regardless of whether you're a long time fan of the Black Keys, or you just started listening. Pick it up!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like the game and it's fun but I wish you could change the tiles to make them easier to match. On my 7&#34; tablet sometimes it's hard to tell the tiles apart.
B00867GHS8|5.0|My grandson will watch this movie over and over.  Great morals, funny, memorable characters...  I can sit through it with him many many times.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book was different and not my type but it was interesting and the writing was good. Even though it was a novel I was happy with the way it ended.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|Grampa is king.My littlest baby girl the newest arrival in our family and my fourth grand child is now the proud owner and very happy with her new involving toy
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I had this for computer before, it was awesome.  The tablet version doesn't disappoint, it's the same game, but just as addicting.
B0015UXNIU|5.0|This condition of this book was 'not as advertised', however, it gets a pass because it is so funny.  I so enjoyed it that I ordered a couple more of his books; none of which can 'hold a candle' to this one.  Of course, my sense of humor may very well be some else's horror story.  So, who's to say?
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|The movie wasn't bad, but it didn't seem to have a point until the end.  No relationships developed and it just felt like a filler or gap move in the series.
0316143472|3.0|This was a bit of a disappointment. The first Sedaris book I read was &#34;Me Talk Pretty One Day&#34; and I laughed till my stomach hurt.  Guess I was expecting too much after that.  Took me a long time to read this because I kept putting it down.  Not something I'm able to do with a good book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Compact set at a great price.  My kids watch these movies over and over and now we can stop renting them!
B000A3XYZA|5.0|Spellbound for the entire performance.<br />Noting a  renaissance for Handel operatic works  judging by the relatively recent (2011) Met HD performance with Renee Fleming and a number of very recent releases on Blu-ray of various Handel operas, I turned to my trusted preview venue: youtube.com<br />Indeed, after previewing a number of these including the Met's and Bayerische (Roschmann, Chance) performances, I happened on this 1998 Glyndebourne gem.<br />Without an iota of doubt it is a GEM not to be missed.<br /><br />One must admit that tastes are individual. As Prince Orlofsky remarks in Die Fledermaus- \\"chacon a son gout\\", but clearly some performances 'move your soul' & 'tickle your fancy'  far more than others.<br />First the performers: Antonacci, Scholl, Streit, Chuimmo, Winter, Stefaniwicz  are all wonderful. Great voices, commanding, convincing & expressive acting; perfect for their roles---Cecil B. DeMille couldn't have done better!<br />William Christie and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  are perfect for Handelian repertoire; and the tempo, contrary to another reviewer's judgement, is ethereal- especially given the plot elements and sentiments expressed.<br />Jean-Marie Villeger's stylish production - placed in the silent movie era - is magnificent, simple and fitting. No unnecessary extraneous elements<br />Check out the aria \\" Io T'Aabraccio\\"  wiith Antonacci & Scholl on youtube & see if you are not hooked!!!!\\"  [...]<br /><br />One quibble: unfortunately, the only DVD disc of this performance currently available in NTSC and Region 1 or 0 for play on U.S. equipment is a KULTUR studio release. As usual Kultur charges premium prices for an inferior product; they seem to have no respect for their customers.<br />Although the picture quality is quite good and the sound is very reasonable ( unusual for Kultur releases judging by the large number I have seen &/previewed and as many other reviewers have also remarked) they are more than cheap herewith their flimsy packaging and next to nil accompanying  printed material (in this case: a single page, double sided--on the first side an exact replica of their cover, and on the other a simple  listing of the number of Chapters without any other truly explanatory material----gotta keep their costs down you know, never mind the customer!)<br /><br />How I wish this performance would be remastered by a caring,credible recording company in blu-ray format with uncompressed sound; and, judging from experience, they would surely include proper subtitles ( as in the Met's production), more than adequate informative printed material and likely special features too (if initially available)<br />---and at a very competitive price point!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Wonderful, easy to read book, that adds so much more to the imagination then the movie. I enjoyed it much more then I expected I would.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was okay. Entertaining. The movie maintains a sense of action suspense throughout but I think it takes away somewhat from the climax, in that I was surprised when the movie was over. Use of montage to set context was heavy-handed. Action was solid though I'm not really sure I buy into the way they tied the story into the original 3. I'll have to watch them all again, I suppose. :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun but would be more enjoyable if ads didn't pop up between each game. It's too annoying.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|A great story line with a wise twist...fantastic acting. Helen Hunt is amazing.....<br />Costumes are beautiful and the ambiance is very realistic....<br />I Liked it !
B007L96SI6|2.0|I love her voice but the songs she picked for this album were disappointing. The ones she did on American Idol were much better. She is really unique but this CD falls short of what she can do.
B009SQQRH2|3.0|Many of the supporting characters were entertaining and funny. Arthur was just plain annoying. Lots of laugh out loud jokes.
B00684J49U|5.0|Love it.<br />Grey's anatomy is a great show, amazing story, and actors. I wan to watch it over and over again.
B002RI9XOW|1.0|The kindle version of this book is littered with errors. I am almost convinced that they used a free image-to-text converter and then didn't bother to go through after to check for mistakes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This is a great story and a really funny read. This one star review is for the poorly edited kindle version of this book, which is infuriatingly bad.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Story was better than what I heard on different media critics. I think it was a good prequel and hope there are more to follow.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This will protect your Kindle and is stylish to boot.  I was recently hospitalized and was reading while wiling away the hours and the neurosurgeon came in with good news, saw my case and said, &#34;I have that exact same case and I love it&#34;.  I felt the same way about both him and my case in that moment!  I highly recommend this.  Wish they had one for my iPad Mini.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Friends began telling me about Downton Abbey but I had missed the episodes on television.  When I finally saw one, I was hooked.  My husband suggested we buy seasons 1 and 2.  We watched them over a rainy weekend and really enjoyed the acting, the story lines, the costumes.  We will watch them again and are happily looking forward to season 3 (which we've already pre-ordered)!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This app is really cute for little girls. My daughter is 7 and she loves this game. She can feed the pets, take them a bath, and play with them. She can also buy play house for the pets with coins she earns in the game. If you ever played any of the story app such as bakery story, pet shop story this is really similar to those.
0062082353|3.0|Very well written but filled with smutty language that contributes nothing and in fact is a turn off for some readers.<br />I bought this book as a gift for a friend but decided not to give it.<br />Cannot understand why the writers, editors or publishers would pass such language on to the public.<br />I don't recommend &#34;American Sniper&#34; to anyone.<br />Book writers and publishers should show some respect to their readers.  If all the filth was removed it would be an excellent story.  I've lost respect for Kyle, not for using such language in his military exploits but for putting it in writing.<br />Sad....
B002WN35DC|4.0|- I give it 4 stars since it is one of my favorite books.<br />- I take out one start because it has no drawings. When reading this book the drawings are really important.
0316228532|5.0|I haven't finished - the Holidays and work - but so far  it is very interesting.Some of the phrases used are so different than we are used to reading.
B0086221SS|3.0|Seemed a little slow at times but good overall. I don't know that I'd watch it again but it kept my attention.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Another nice album of Christmas music from the Glee cast.  Great takes on some traditional songs along with some new ideas.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Generally it was good but too long.  I think the last one was better.  I rate a 3.5/  The last batman with the joker was a 4.2.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I've owned two &#34;leatherneck&#34; type devices. I paid much more for the other two than I did for this one. There is just no comparison. This stainless steel device is solid, works flawlessly, and has every tool I wanted. Gerber has a home run with this. I just hope they can keep the price where it currently is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So much fun and  . Easy to work I love it<br />Some of the games are a little hard tho work but if you get the hang of it it becomes easy to do<br />Love it fun fun fun
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My husband is a weather channel freak. The world doesn't exist until he has checked the Weather Channel. Thought I better bet the app.
B0014KFV6I|4.0|This album has withstood the passage of time.  it still holds up. Carole King weaves a magic Tapestry of music.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Got  to have this to network with people. When on vacation, at work or just sitting on the deck. It's really a no brain er, got to have it.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|After having played around with several other music players, I have to say that Rocket Player is the best.  It gives me full and organized access to all of the music on my phone and even has a built in graphic equalizer.<br /><br />I'd recommend this app to any one that appreciates music.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Gives me a break from Drop Words. Still trying to get to new levels. Great sound effects. The family plays it.

B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It was down loaded by accident. Haven't really learned how it opens or works. Also got another app- a dog one? That's gone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I'm a weather guru, so I check this app often during the day.  It is nice to be able to check the forecast hourly especially during winter weather.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I choose 0 stars because it's a dictionary and their not interesting<br />When would you need a  dictionary an  if you did you could just ask some one
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is so great to 're- connect with friends from high school and from the past.  It is also great way to share what is going on in my life with family & friends.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|The movie was funny and fun for the entire family -- we laughed and enjoyed the the movie as well as the storyline.
159514188X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. The story line was awesome. There were moments of the book that caught me off guard. Had hard time putting this down.  Very detailed. Book was interesting from beginning to end. No dull parts. The author told this story in a very honest and loving way.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|This movie had bad coloring and it was poorly filmed. Acting was to confusing cause the characters changed there personalities with each scene. The movie ended suddenly without warning. It was stupid, nothing like the previews. Worst ever for such a highly advertised movie.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This was such an amazing book! It's meant for a directioner. If you love one direction then you need to read this book
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season (Blu-ray) was purchased for my son, who is an avid zombie watcher!! Because of his work schedule he isn't able to watch the episodes when they are aired on TV but this allows  him to watch it whenever he has time. It was shipped super quick, was packed very well, and was purchased at a great price. He also owned the complete second season.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|Excelente artículo. Fué entregado en el lapso prometido y las expectativas fueron cumplidas. Gracias y estaré pendiente por futuras ofertas.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This isn't just one of the best Bob Marley albums ever, it is one of the best ALBUMS of all time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book that will make you cry smile and laugh .l loved this book so much. Perfection
B007WFTFG6|2.0|Too basic for big kids and loses toddlers attention quickly. Deleted after one day.  Wouldn't recommend it, even if its free.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've read the other books in the series and loved them. This book was also good, but I felt like it could have been longer.
B006R1T40I|4.0|She's still got it.  Some of the music is different from what she's done on recent albums.  But its all good.<br />You have to listen a few times to really feel some of the songs.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I luv Riordan`s books. HE has outdone himself on Mark of Athena. Every child,adult,etc should read it. So enjoy it!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My grandson LOVES this movie and all the kids that come over Love it. Would recommened this kids love it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First book I've read by Sparks, and although I don't normally read romance stories I definitely want to read more of his works. Very thought provoking and keeps you from on putting the book down.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I loved this book more for the detailed descriptions than for the actual story.  Although the story was good and kept me interested, it was the way Richard Ford painted a picture of every scene.  You could feel and see everything......I was spellbound.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This really is a strange book, but that's what makes it special. The main character Charlie sees life in such a pure unfiltered way that makes you really think about life and what it all means. I would recommend it to anybody who has ever had the feeling that they don't belong or that they are alone. It just might change your life.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Similar to the other MIB films.  It is charmingly fun / funny.  A few little plot twists keep it interesting.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Clancy opens up hair raising possibilities of what is possible in cyberwarfare. there was a time when information and its management was at the heart of success. Clancy raises the issue and a very credible and layman's level language why the heart of successful warefore is in the cyber-dependency of the warrior. of course, brains, courage and perseverance wins the day.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|not sure of the exact accuracy of the storylines, but great dvd time on a cold day. Glad I caught an episode on BBC America and got the enitre set.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|I don't normally write movie reviews but had to make an exception for this one.  I have been an F1 and Indycar fan for a very long time.  I was at the edge of my seat every minute during this movie.  It celebrates Senna's amazing racing career as well as his life.  The in race footage is phenomenal. If you are a fan of F1, this movie is for you.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas - he wanted it, not me. He had been looking for the blu-ray copy and could not find anywhere. He was pleased with viewing this copy and enjoyed the extra facts that came with the DVD.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love the Mitch Rapp series.  This is the latest in the series and is action packed as all the others.  A great read.

B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzle are fun and can be as challenging as you like, especially if you rotate the pieces, or easy to start with.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I love this movie! It is such a cute movie.  They don't make movies like they use to! Love it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I didn't think I would laugh as hard as I did. The movie was super funny. The actually singing  scenes were great. I'm gonna by it on blu ray for the extras.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love Phillip's voice!  It is a great CD, I bought this as a gift for My husband and he loves it!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|great and free. would definitely recommend. he is so funny- kids love him and grown ups too. play all day
B00AKKS278|1.0|Background:  I bought the Kindle edition of this book during a bout of insomnia to see what it was about.  I couldn't tell by the description if it was a book that would help someone become a morning person or just help someone make the most out of their morning.  Either way, I thought it could be useful and gave it a shot.<br /><br />That being said, I at least now know what the book is about and will be asking for a refund.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book:<br />* Wake up early.<br />* Do the stuff you know you should be doing but aren't (exercise, etc.).<br /><br />In and of itself, this is not horrible advice (maybe it is for insomniacs, but that's a different discussion altogether).  What is horrible is that this book summarizes these points in a list on one page and spends the remaining 171 pages spewing motivational quotes from gurus, building up a trademarked acronym/mnemonic device (Life S.A.V.E.R.S. - really?), recalling saccharine stories meant to evoke a rallying emotion on the reader's behalf, and spinning a hodgepodge \\"system\\" for success borrowed from all the big-name motivational systems like The Secret, Think and Grow Rich, etc.  You know, stuff like \\"YOU DESERVE to have the BEST LIFE EVER!\\"<br /><br />So, because the book is 99% BEST LIFE EVER and less than 1% \\"put the alarm clock at the other end of the room\\" (seriously, is this one of the \\"Not-So-Obvious Secrets Guaranteed to Transform Your Life\\"?!), I can't with good conscience give this book anything better than a 2 out of 5.<br /><br />But if you notice, I gave it a 1 out of 5.  In part, this is due to the purposely vague description and sample chapter attached to the book.  But really, this is more for the scammy reviews peppering this product.  If you look, you'll see somewhere around 32 or so 5 star reviews between 8 and 13 December.  Given that this book was set to launch on 12 December, this is definitely a \\"pump\\".  Looking a little deeper, you'll see that the top reviews are from people who have ONLY rated this book and maybe Hal's other book, specifically:  Steve Adams on 10 December, Anna M. Potter on 10 December, Max Fly on 9 December, Sylvia on 13 December, Marcus on 13 December, Curtis Wills on 12 December, Derek Serbin on 12 December, and many more! ... you get the picture?<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help save you your time and your money.people who have ONLY rated this book and maybe Hal's other book, specifically:  Steve Adams on 10 December, Anna M.

B0092MKTL2|4.0|On rotation in my car. Better with repeated listening. Along the lines of Mutemath and The Script. Very, very nice.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham isn't writing as well as he used to - it almost seems like his heart isn't in it anymore. However he still knows how to string words into a tail.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I really enjoyed this addition to the series so many questions answered and so many others raised, ugh now for the ling wait for more
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I didn't know what to expect. I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and wanted to test out the game feature. I loved this game. It was challenging without being impossible. The graphics were excellent. The story was good too. I like a game where there was thought put toward engaging the mind of the player as well as the imagination. Gotta love a game that has some meat to it and is enjoyable to play. I hope there are more games like this one available.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Very good writing and creative imagination. I can see why it has received good ratings. While reading it though I couldn't help but think of the books out there about real life &#34;adrift at sea&#34; stories where people actually lived through horrific situations. It seems a bit unfair that a totally made up story receives such fanfare. I questioned whether it was a good use of my time.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|this was a good show  it was just different enoughto be interesting it was a little hard to hear at times but all in all it was entertaining for another police show
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought this would be boring, but it turned out to be really addicting! It's easy and fun. I would recommend this as a fun way to spend your time!
B0056BU3I2|3.0|It is always nice to receive Christmas gifts quickly and in good condition, as it makes it easier to get them wrapped in time.  I would have liked to get this a little quicker though.  Especially since I had clicked on having it filled by Amazon and therefore should have received the free 2 day shipping that comes with a Prime account.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I can't believe Michael Connelly wrote this book; I felt like it was written by an amateur and at least the first half of the book was boring.<br /><br />Heidi Jehn
B00000JQ0E|5.0|There's no question that Californication is one of the finest works by RHCP, but this year's vinyl reissue (cut by Bernie Grundman) is the first officially released version of the album that finally does it justice. Like Geee! said in his review, it doesn't sound as good as Stadium Arcadium on vinyl, however it has more to do with the way the album was recorded/mixed (according to some articles, the band specifically wanted that \\"dry\\", almost monophonic sound). Anyway, this is the best sounding version of Californication you ever going to get unless it's completely remixed and remastered. No more annoying clipping, and the songs have so much more breathing space. Another reason to buy this is that for several songs (most notably Easily and Savior) slightly different mixes were used, which were previously circulating on the internet.<br />P.S. Since there are no visible signs on the sleeve (except the blue sticker), check matrix numbers on the records to make sure you've actually got a reissue:<br />(Side A): -25503- 1-531908-A2 CB P.USA<br />(Side B): -25503- 1-531908-B CB P.USA<br />(Side C): -25504- 1-531908-C CB P.USA<br />(Side D): -25604- 1-531908-D CB P.USA
B007EE564U|4.0|This is a realy cool book;so many twists and turns its hard to put down.Fast paced,fiction but so believable you could be part of it.I realy enjoyed it.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|It is difficult to see if you have the subject in the picture without cutting their head off or missing them because you cannot see the subjec tif you turn it around to take pix or videos..<br />needs a handle to hold it perhaps
B007HACDLK|5.0|Best Vince Flynn, Mitch Rapp, in years!  I read this book in 5 hours.....hardly took time to snack! What a page turner!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|One of the best sales books I have ever read.  Some of the claims are sensational but there is plenty of original thinking to justify 5 stars.
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|I quite enjoyed McConaughey's character through most of the movie as he plays a very believable heavy, but near the end he goes absolutely nuts in a scenery chewing bit that stretches the character beyond any sort of recognizable reality and contradicts his entire persona of a cool calm killer. I won't describe it so as to avoid a spoiler, but it takes you completely out of the movie and has you either laughing or shaking your head at the director for including the scene. Also, as I'm sure others have lamented, the unresolved ending is not a device that leaves the audience with any satisfaction. The ancients spoke about catharthis and epiphany as the way various themes resolve themselves at the conclusion of a performance. Emile Kirsch aquits himself nicely here and shows he is fully capable of transitioning from child to adult actor.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got this for free as an Amazon freebie of the day.  I am able to speed right by the ad on the opening screen and there arent any more ads after that.  The majong is fun.  I pretty happy scoring this for free.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|The greatest trilogy of all. Hobbits. They are a tricky lot...who eat well, and do a fine bit o adventuring. Take my word for it, something you just have to see.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|It enhances my experience of this film beyond a film. Love the voices and the music. The nuances of the lyrics are well-captured.
0156013983|4.0|If you enjoy reading French books, then this is an excellent book to have in your collection. It is a beautifully written tale with many life lessons. This book can be enjoyed by children and by adults. There is something for everyone to take away from this book.
B0014JKJK2|5.0|I got a pair of these shoes for Christmas last year and have been wearing them to work everyday for a year!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My grandaughters were thrilled to receive this new edition Red CD from Taylor Swift. Great songs, good sound. Shipped quickly.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm not crazy about G5 and their blatant advertising but their games are beautifully illustrated and they're just basically very fun to play, nonetheless.<br /><br />Mahjong Artifacts (1) is just an example of how the illustrations really set apart G5's games from others who make similar themed games.<br /><br />If you have a tablet, this is a must-have.
B006FE83UE|5.0|If you enjoy drama, classic holiywood, a great story and a great actor, this is a must have. Gregory Peck is at his dramatic finest in the vehichle. Don't miss this movie. Even if you have seen before, watch it again.....<br />This rates with his performance in Moby Dick.....
034580404X|5.0|Who would have thought. This is one of the best love stories I've ever read! A must-read for all couples.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I bought this for myself to go with Iron Man One - could not wait for Iron Man 3 and the combo package, oh well...
B007HO392S|5.0|I've had this album since the release date, and it's freaking awesome!  Carrie herself described it as \\"14 tracks of awesome\\" as mentioned in another review, and she's right!<br />It just keeps getting better the more I listen to it!<br />Personally, Carrie is my favorite artist, so I may be a little opinionated here, but if you don't own this album yet, what are you waiting for?!<br />My favorite tracks on the album are<br />- Good Girl<br />- Blown Away<br />- Two Black Cadillacs<br />- Cupid's Got a Shotgun<br /><br />The first 3 are radio singles, so if you listen to country radio at all, you've probably heard them before.<br /><br />Carrie does not disappoint!!!  If you ever get a chance to see Carrie perform live, GRAB IT!!!  She sounds as good live as she does on a CD!  Not all artists can say that.  Some just don't sound at all the same live as they do on their CDs.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.  I know this story so well and have seen countless movies and versions of it. Nothing beats reading the original Christmas story. I plan on 're-reading this story every year at Christmas.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. Confirms belief in life after death, and near death experiences. Thank you for your courage.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It has all the required elements for a great book. Love and chaos. I highly recommend it for all young adults
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a wonderful set for the price.The movies are all great and aren't the standard superhero fare. I was surprised that the digital download gave all three movies.glad I would  highly recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|face book is good but some folks put toooooo much info on it - I do not need to know<br />if you went to the bathroom!!!  If you get my drift.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone. It was action packed, romantic, and enthralling. One of the best I've read.
0300169787|5.0|This is a stunning book - worthy of the designer whose work it chronicles. The design and the quality of the book are excellent!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is awesome.you get to build anything to get your pig to a checkpoint.u should really buy this app.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I thought the movie was just ok, I was more disappointed with the ending than anything else in the movie.  It was a little too long without enough &#34;actual&#34; story line and the &#34;forest&#34; reminded me of Princess Bride which in my estimation was a MUCH better movie.  But that's another story.  I was thinking about buying this for my collection but will bypass it completely.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|It's the only sitcom that I watch. The comedy is funny and the characters are interesting. We even went to the moon! Can't beat that.

B0059XTU1S|5.0|I put off seeing the Hobbit movie in part because I read all of the critics' reviews of it. You may know what they said: too slow-paced, too stodgily faithful to the book, overwhelmed by extraneous material thrown in, just plain silly, and just not up to the prequel-sequel. Now that I've taken in a matin&eacute;e of the movie, I have to ask this question:<br /><br />What movie did the critics watch?<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (TH:AUJ) was the most fun that I've had at the theater in a long time. Yes, folks, I did use the f-word just now. Let me use it again: fun, fun, fun! I won't say that the first Hobbit movie was better than the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy, but I will say that it was more fun.<br /><br />As a book, The Hobbit presented a challenge for being filmed: it's both a children's book and the prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the acme of high fantasy. Given such a source, a movie based on The Hobbit had to combine whimsy with high adventure without letting either overwhelm the other.<br /><br />I'm here to say that Peter Jackson rose gloriously to the challenge. I fell in love with TH:AUJ from its introduction, intercutting bucolic scenes from the Shire on the eve of Bilbo Baggins's one hundred and eleventh birthday with majestic, marvelous, and tragic scenes of the Mannish trade center of Dale and the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. These scenes showed all of the loving attention to detail of the LOTR movies and beautifully set the scene for a sixty-year's younger Bilbo's adventures.<br /><br />In the inimitable \\"perfectly faithful to the book, which I'm completely rewriting\\" Peter Jackson style, he pitchforks us moviegoers next into Bilbo's meeting with the wandering wizard Gandalf and with thirteen Dwarves led by the obsessive Thorin Oakenshield, heir to the lost kingdom of Erebor. Jackson captures beautifully the mirth and mayhem of Bilbo's unexpected dinner party as well as the dark drama behind Thorin's quest, on which the reluctant Bilbo is supposed to go as a burglar.<br /><br />Soon, Bilbo is running out his front door without a handkerchief, and he and we are off on an adventure that won't let up. Some critics complain that each scene TH:AUJ is longer than scenes were in the LOTR trilogy, but what the critics call a fault, I call a virtue: we have a chance to see a whole storyline play out rather than watching telescoped bits and pieces of scenes that we got in the trilogy. The pace and the flow of TH:AUJ made it seem to me far shorter than its two hours and forty some-odd minutes of running time. For me, the movie never slowed down.<br /><br />Parts of TH:AUJ are over the top, but, more often than not, gloriously so. I found Sylvester McCoy's portrayal of Radagast the Brown -- a portrayal in which he largely reprises his take on Dr. Who -- far less intrusive than critics have made it out to be. Even his rabbit-drawn sleigh had a mad logic to it. As for mad logic, the battle in the halls of the Great Goblin under the Misty Mountains won't be believed, but may well just be enjoyed.<br /><br />Between scenes of adventure, there are scenes of Elvish wonders and of Middle-Earth's beauty that will bring tears of joy to Tolkienphiles' eyes. At its best, TH:AUJ is a visual extravaganza that makes the prequel-sequel look drab.<br /><br />TH:AUJ goes only through chapter seven of The Hobbit. Purists may sniff at the enhanced role given to Bilbo in the movie compared with what he played in that part of the book, in which he was mainly baggage. My response is, \\"Hey, the enhanced role works!\\" Along with it, you get to see Gollum, as scene-stealing as ever,and even glimpses of the dragon Smaug, who must carry the next movie, and looks as if he'll do so with style.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that TH:AUJ isn't as respectable as the LOTR trilogy. On the other hand, as Bilbo Baggins learns, it's not until you give up being respectable that you have adventures.the reluctant Bilbo is supposed to go as a burglar.<br /><br />Soon, Bilbo is running out his front door without a handkerchief, and he and we are off on an adventure that won't let up.

B00338QENI|5.0|This Was an amazing read. I could not put it down. It was both informative on the science behind everything and interesting in terms of the human interest story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book very intense there wasn't a moment i was bored. I never wanted to put the book down.
145210655X|4.0|I bought this as a gift, then ended up buying two more for other people to give as well.  The book is cute and mostly funny (yes, there are a few misses) and I love the concept.  The more avid the fan the more they'll probably enjoy it as a lot of the scenes or quotes are lifted from the movies and then changed to include Luke as a child.<br />This isn't a book necessarily to read to your children though.  My best friend's 4 year old loves Star Wars and grabbed the book wanting it to be read to her.  She liked the pictures but didn't get most of the jokes I'm sure.<br />For the price it was a great little gift that didn't break the bank.  I've already pre-ordered the sequel.
0061743526|5.0|&#34;to kill a mockingbird &#34; book print easy to read, with nice spacing between lines and print is nice and dark.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book kept me guessing until almost the complete end before the finished out the story line. Definitely a worthwhile read.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|Played for only a short time and the game ended.  You have to buy the full version, otherwise the game ends.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I'm enjoying the Theodore Boone collection of Grisham books. It's an enjoyable deviation from the typical story lines. Hopefully there will be more of these in the near future.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Habits are great! They simplify life, reduce your cognitive load, and free up brain capacity for the real issues. Because habits are so valuable to people, habits are easily formed. Just think about how much of your day life is based on routines and how quickly you took the joy of your new car for granted. Even being the President of USA becomes a habit.<br /><br />A habit is established when people do things (e.g. driving a car) automatically without (much) thinking. There are three elements to a habit: a trigger, a routine, and a reward. Duhigg goes to great length to explain each element. He does this in an elegant way with several references to research. I enjoyed the latter as this gives more credibility to his thinking and writing. Duhigg does a great job at explaining habits and why they are desired  not only by people but also marketers.<br /><br />Being a marketer, I would love to see more examples of how the thinking about habits may be employed in this profession and how it may coexist with customer satisfiaction.

B000OP1M6M|4.0|This is my second automatic watch purchase (first was an Orient Millenium for wearing to work).  This Seiko will be more of a weekend/beater watch.  I was torn between the black SKX007 or this Pepsi bezel.  I ultimately went with the Pepsi 009 because I like a splash of color (just like the blue hands on the Millenium).<br /><br />Note, the dial color of the 009 does not seem to be the same blue as the bezel (I was expecting this color difference from reading other reviews).  It's not black, more of a dark grey/blue in most lighting.  Speaking of lighting, the lum on the hands and hour markers is quite bright and long lasting.<br /><br />The bracelet seems flimsy for the heft of the watch, but once on the wrist, it is very comfortable.  I also separately ordered a rubber strap (with the older-style flat vents), which I anticipate using in the warmer months.<br /><br />The outer edge of the bezel isn't beveled, giving a nice depth to the watch, but also causing the watch to wear \\"big\\".  This contributes to the hearty feel of the watch making it perfect to wear for light duty, but it would probably have some issues fitting under a shirt cuff. I was initially concerned the watch diameter might be too large for my taste, but it looks great on my 7.5\\" wrist.  I wear watches on my right arm, so the crown position near 4 o'clock is a nice comfort.<br /><br />Overall, great looking watch.  Pleased with the purchase.  Seems to be a great value!

1451627297|5.0|one of the best books I have read in a long time!!! couldn't put it down!!! this is a must read!
1421550644|5.0|The art of Nausicaa is something that Hayao Miyazaki apologizes for, yet it's beautiful and organic and pencil like.  It evokes the feelings of a world that's a little rough around the edges and fits the wonderful story being told.  But if you're buying this box set you've probably already read the manga.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the nicest printing of this product I've ever seen.  The box set is well constructed and sturdy, and will stand up to reading over and over again through the years.  If you love Nausicaa, this is the definitive version to own.
B0055SWM08|4.0|keeps me occupied. fun game with nice music. gets harder gradually rather than right away and has hints which you have to work for making them valuable. good times.
0345529057|5.0|At first I was intimidated because of the length of the books and maybe the writing, but soon enough after reading just a few pages I was hooked. The writing is pretty great and easy to understand. And while there may be too many characters to keep up with, George R.R Martin makes you want to.<br /><br />The box set was very practical and at a great price.<br />So much love for this series, can't wait for the last two books and the next season!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking bad is the best series on television shuts sad to say it over saved a lot getting it on amazon if you haven't watched you must! So awesome

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Once you get the hang of this game it's pretty fun to play, as well as challenging.  I'm trying to get the hubby to try it.
B0064W67IM|5.0|But it is Neil, so didn't expect any less. You can see how some areas are a little rough but this was the beginning so that can easily be forgiven, especially for such great work.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I'm sorry, but I thought this game was boring, I'm glad it was free and that I was able to try it out, but I deleted it from my Kindle.
0061438294|5.0|The receiver of this gift was excited to receive the book.  Anticipation and satisfaction.  I'll want to read this, too.  Very interesting book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love Angry Birds and have bought every one they have out, currently.  My husband and I like to play this and help each other out on the different levels.
0525953728|5.0|Bought it for my husband who served in the Air Force EOD  in the late seventies.  Says it is well written, interesting without giving away the SEALS tactics.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|As I read this book, I really wanted it to be a true story. It is filled with humor, tragedy, and Pi's strength to endure what he has to. I loved the book.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|My favorite app... All the news I need in a spectacular and easy format. I don't know what else to say about it.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|prefect picture and great present for anyone who is into motorcycles and anyone who enjoys the sons of anarchy series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If you like adventure hidden object games with lots of puzzles you will find this both interesting and challenging.  Hard to put it down.  Love G5 games. State of the Art.  Well worth the money.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The book is a little different than the first three. It focuses on characters who were more of minor characters in the first three books. Is still excellent but the exclusion of Jon Snow & Tryion prevented me from giving it five stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really love this book and recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good read. The book grabs you and doesn't let go.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing book!  Hate I waited so long to read the trilogy.  Hope this author comes out with more wonderful reading very soon.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Works great... Easily connected my iPod classic to my Bose sound dock. Sound great! Works like a Charm.  I would strongly recommend
B005IQZB14|5.0|Tough getting through the drug years, but so glad I continued on with the book. She really told it all !<br />Great read !
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I adored the movie - the creative differences were stellar, well planned, and made me understand and respect characters (like Javert).<br />The military stringency of Crowe's Javert; the pleading and hopeless of Hathaway's Fantine; the bitter fear of Jackman's Valjean, the orchestrations that told the story without a word having to be said - all of it is simply amazing and provides a depth to the characters that seeing the play (in Philadelphia, NYx2, and London) has yet to hold a candle to.  The perfect blend of Hollywood capabilities and theatrics is what happened for the movie.<br /><br />Listening to the Highlights CD gives the same feeling of the movie.  While there are certain songs listeners of the Broadway soundtracks will miss \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\", \\"Thenardier Waltz of Treachery\\", \\"Little People\\" and \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" - \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" IS in the Epilogue.  These missing songs also allow for a full soundtrack to be released at a later date.<br /><br />Simply amazing!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Best Sci-Fi moving in while - this one is a real hit in my opinion! Most likely NOT an Academy award contender and the story is not perfect but it's a solid Sci-Fi classic to be...
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I thought this movie was better than the first Total Recall.<br />Kate Beckinsale was amazing and she outdid everyone else in the fight scenes!<br />Would watch again!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  It is very quick moving from level to level.  Easy to learn to play.<br />I would definitely recommend this to everyone..
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This is a classic that everyone should see at least once. Cary Grant is awesome and the plot twists and turns are great.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I happen to like this program series and will continue to update when new seasons come out on the market.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Completely addicted to this game like it's going out of style. This is a awesome game! I would recommend this to anybody.
0374531943|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. He read almost 100 pages on Christmas Day and loves it!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Playback issue kept occurring. Family unable to watch entire movie. The movie was cute but so corny and predictable. Word word word word
1419705849|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old grandson. He has the entire series and has enjoyed them all.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Both my kids and I enjoy this game, it makes one think a bit for the answer.<br />Even after thinking it's trying to implement and that may be a task in itself.<br />Overall enjoyment from a great product.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so thrilled with Downton Abbey.  I can't wait for season three, I am sure the plot thickens with Bates being in jail, and Mary and Matthew's  impending wedding.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|This is a pretty good feminist story about the author.  Was looking for something to give my neice.  Too adult for her, but a nice quick funny read for me.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I loved this book !<br /><br /> Who would.ever think that Rowley. Would have a girlfriend? This is an amazing series to me!
B009POHHRG|5.0|Easily the best Joker story ever written.  The artwork and coloring are nothing short of amazing as well.  If you are looking for some great Joker quotes this contains some of his very best.
B00ARAO6R6|2.0|This movie had a cliff-hanging ending it was difficult to follow. Expected more given Mathew McConaughey was on board.  However,  this movie was a little confusing.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Movie was great, but the streaming quality was worse than a cheap bootleg.  Never had any stops, but the pixilation was horrible.  AND I paid for HD.  there is a problem when Amazon says they will reduce the quality to stream better, but you still paid for HD.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I played this on my friend's iphone, and was really fun, but then downloading it onto my kindle... no. it keeps saying &quot; download failed, please try again.&quot;
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show. Great acting and great writing. Anyone who loves crime fiction and is interested in law, but hates law and order because it's too gimmicky will love this show. A lot of the cases are taken from real life and a wide range of interesting legal topics and situations are covered. This show makes me really happy when I watch it because it's just so well made.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Best book I've read in the past 5 years! Get the free sample download sent to you and I promise you that you will make the purchase shortly after.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie is now One of my favorites and I would suggest to anyone but interested in fighting movies should get this movie. The storyline is really good and the fighting was really good

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Free! Easy to use and helps quickly navigate what you are looking for. I am really happy I downloaded the app.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|We play this game on the laptop and it has become a family favorite.  It does become a little more difficult to maneuver things quickly on the Kindle without a mouse but they also seem to have made this version a little easier.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|They first gave us a update that would show only lime 10 posts and the rest were all blue bit they just had a new update that makes it easier to like,comment,or share things the also shaw all the posts on your news feed its awsome....
B008N1LL42|5.0|Much better than the trailer. I like how they used the history of the Missouri. It was a bit cheezy in some parts but still very good.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Dickens's classic is now illustrated with excellent pictures! Though they are black & white this great E-book is perfect for the holidays!
1452110581|2.0|Not for kids!!!  It's proabbly fine for most adults. It has bad language in some of the poems and it's just not appropriate for kids.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This move is so funny we had to have it in our collection of classic Christmas movies.  I had it recorded from the TV and our entire family watches this movie every year but we are tired of the commercials so we bought it.  The format works perfectly on our 55&#34; Samsung TV.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its worth your time and it doesnt crash like other apps. this app gives you coins . or fake money to buy other games. the only think i dont  like is the fact that you start off with 8 of there games and then you have to earn money to buy all the 132 games.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Started out slow for me, but ended up pretty good.  I'm not a huge baseball fan...if I were, I would've probably enjoyed it more.
0802473156|5.0|Just wanted to give this book a 5 star review, it has been life changing to me and my relationships, especially with my husband and new in-laws years ago.  My husband and I read it together and discussed each of the chapters, and we did this BEFORE we married, which was a really excellent idea.  It has helped me in relationships in general, not just with him.  I am a huge fan of Dr Chapman and highly recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a page turner despite the heavy subject matter. The love story that ran throughout the different situations restores hope and faith in true love. This book involves real life & though it can be dark, frightening & ugly, there is still light through it all. Emotional, but wonderful. This is a must read!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|If you are looking for a fun game to pass the time and entertain little girls then this the one for you. I am amazed at all the things it can do curl, cut shampoo and style. It's amazing.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|This game brings back memories. This is almost an exact port of the dreamcast classic, but there un lies the problem.  If you have played this game on the dreamcast, or any of the other &quot;ports&quot; you will get through this pretty quick. All the same old puzzles, nothing new. If you have never played this game, get it. For the rest of you, if you want to play through all the same puzzles, well here you go.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love this game it keeps you busy for hours. I would recommend it to others. Great game...so give it a try.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I like this album a lot, good laid back music to relax to. Like to listen to this while doing homework.
