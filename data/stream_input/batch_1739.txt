B00005JLEU|5.0|In a world where alternate realities are just a bridge away, but that are hidden away by the Gods, Chihiro Ogino finds herself and her parents transported to a bathhouse frequented by those Gods. Here Chihiro must take a job at a bathhouse in order to not be transformed into an animal like her parents already have been turned into. And it here in this alternate reality that Chihuro finds herself succeeding against all odds and against the wishes of Yubaba - owner of the establishment. Yubaba is a capricious witch who enslaves those around her by taking away their names. And if they forget their names, then Yubaba can keep them enslaved forever. Now Chihiro is beginning to forget her name. And when she does forget her name, she will be trapped forever.<br /><br />Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away's is probably the most famous of Studio Ghibli films. It is a beautiful, lush film that takes you fully into Japanese culture and mythology. The visuals are always stunning and the story is fast-tracked and a roller coaster of fun and enchantment. The characters are all interesting in their own ways. And the plot line reaches a satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />This movie represents the 14th consecutive Studio Ghibli film (click my name for those reviews of the first 13) that I have now seen and represents the pinnacle of the fantasy side of Studio Ghibli. Though there is no environmental message here like there is in some of the other Studio Ghibli fantasy films, it is still an accessible film about the alienation we feel when we are young and how that leads us along the path from childhood to adulthood.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I read Catching Fire straight after The Hunger Games.  In hindsight it would have been better to have a break as I found it a little repetitive.  However the plot captivates you in Katness's journey to find herself and put some sense into the troubled world she lives in.  I have now finished Mockingjay - the 3rd in the series.  In my opinion this is the best in the series - but keep the tissues handy.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Action until the very end! This movie had me gripped from the start. Great character development and plenty of twists and turns for those of us who like to try to figure things out. You will have a hard time working out this puzzle. The movie was interesting to say the least.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great read.  A long time meat eater, this book bad me rethink my eating assumptions; do vegans have something?  I am not ready to give up hamburgers yet, but I am considering.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A fun way to kill time. You can \\"cheat\\"  by selecting \\"winning deal\\" or challenge yourself with a random deal. Either way it's a blast to play.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|sweeeeet way better than the first game. The customization and RPG aspects rock, I am not looking forward to how much time and money this game will cost me.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|I like so much the cd, the blu-ray is too much, great cuality!! Im wait the anotares concerts that i did byt!!!
B00913DPW2|5.0|I downloaded this Game, it was a nice time killer initially, but the more i went forward, the more i wanted to find out more... one day, before i knew it, it was 3am and i was there trying to solve more Puzzles.<br />Took me 20 days to finish it, i did not look at any solutions except the Wires Box that was impossible even with the solution (lol) anyway, i truly enjoyed this Game and i wish itwould have lasted longer... Needless to say i will get the sequel
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Enjoyed it every bit as much as I have all of the Jack Reacher series. I'm saddened to have to wait now for the next one.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I love to hear the raspy voice of Rod Stewart and he was great as a rock star, but he really found his genre in romantic music.  All four disc's are great and I find myself singing along with Rod.  It is great romantic dance music, the music is from the 40's, 50's and 60's.  There is also an added bonus of a video of Rod's live performance at the Apollo and it is great.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves the more romantic music.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|The times may change,but this band stays the same! Always great vocals and music from out of this world! I hope they keep rockin forever.Never dissapointed,when I pick up a new album from these guys and this one is NO exception! What a great CD!!
B008O69SZ0|4.0|Ian Hunter & his Rant Bands New cd \\"when I'm President\\" didn't appeal much to me at first listen with the title track being the standout. But after a few more laps thru I found that only 2 tracks still didn't rate. Now I cann't stop playing the duet track that he does with his son Jesse. All in all this bunch is wild & rates as some of his best work. LOVE IT! GIVE IT A LISTEN !
0439023521|5.0|Bought this for my son, but I ended up reading it before he did.  Don't usually read fiction, but this was a good read.  My have to finish the trilogy.
B0028AQLYE|5.0|It works great, it reduces the air entrance but that make you stronger ;)<br />Obviusly it only works with all styles snorkel
B0083EW97W|5.0|This is a great album by John. It's not as good as Battle Studies in my opinion, but once again John has reinvented himself and tried something new, and once again it's fantastic!
B002YIHO7I|3.0|I only liked a couple of the songs. I guess I don't like her as much as I use too.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album! It is so much more upbeat and uplifiting than their first album, which is great as well, but this one is in a class of its own. The lyrics are more religious than their first album, but they are fantastic, and I still can't get enough of the banjo picking! I hope these guys make it big in the US, the American music scene has been dying for a band that just performs their own good music.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this woman's voice and the songs she does. I also keep this tape in my car.It's a beautiful tape.
B00830SLVE|5.0|Great period piece and a real page turner!  Well drawn characters and a great plot.  Very few errors in editing which so often happens in Kindle editions.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I completed the book because I wanted to know how it ended.  The author is a good writer, but the book was about 100 pages too long.  I did not need to know every thought in the main characters' heads.  They were a couple of people who deserved one another. It is also a commentary on what actually goes on in some relationships; that is getting \\"even\\" with their partners.  The main characters had no redeeming qualities, perhaps with the exception Margo.  The book was not quite boring, but darn close.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I expected much more from this, especially with all of the hype before it hit theaters.  The book is a lot better.
1439153663|4.0|This book came out the same time as the book,The Help, and I wondered why it did not do as well.  Some may find the subject matter of slavery depressing, but I think it may have lacked a balance in the points of view and personality of the slave girl in comparison to the young indentured servant  The book reveals many different types of bondage: a child's abuse by a cruel schoolmaster; a mother's to loss of her childen and coping with a frequently absent husband; and secrets which develop resentful and hurt feelings.  Yes, the subject matter overshadows the little humor in the book, but the humor must be appreciated along with some of the heartaches. This is not the typical book about slavery, although one can't get away from the daily life of slaves. There are two incidents in the book that may make one shiver.  One cannot have a book about slavery and totally ignore that aspect of life.  But let's face it,  It provides some insight into what occured on many planatations, including the many children born as a result of plantation owners &#34;bedding&#34; the female slaves for various reasons.  The bottom line is that the women (slaves) really did not have a choice; and wives had no say in the matter either.  So call it what you may.  While one is still a slave, you cannot have a typical parent- child relationship. I wish miss Grissom would have taken a chance and given us a little more of the plantations owner's enslaved daughter's personality and humor.  It would have made this a five-star book. It is worth reading.
1591841151|5.0|When reading Guy Kawasaki, I always feel like I am in a conversation, rather than a lecture - and this book is no exception.  Having worked in and around private equity and small/emerging businesses throughout my career, Kawasaki provides great insights to the entrepreneur looking to start something special.<br /><br />FOcusing on practical advice, as well as providing real world examples and actionable suggestions, Kawasaki will guide the novice or experienced entrepreneur through the pitfalls and pratfalls that accompany the start up environment.  Especially enlightening - given my own background - are his suggestions on the pitch, the deck, board composition and relations, as well as the \\"importance\\" and assumptions around the financial forecasts.<br /><br />The title says a lot - the startup process is more *ART* than science.  Kawasaki provides a good guide and great insights into that process.  Well worth reading, and likely to be dog eared and well notated by the budding entrepreneur.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Good science fiction movies are hard to come by. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I just couldn't. It is filled with cliched characters, story gimmicks from other movies (&#34;borrowed&#34; from Avatar, Star Wars, Star Trek) and a female character who pants, moans, and screams her way through the whole thing. It just got too much, and the pay off was ludicrous. When Ridley Scott is good, he is very, very good -  but when he is bad, he is unbearable. I recommend you skip this.
B008LP8QE8|2.0|First of all, my comment specifically addresses the kindle edition and the technical side of it. As for the content, the book is amazing - no complaints there.<br />Amazon seems not to understand or just ignore the difference between fiction books that you read from page one onwards, possibly in one sitting, and academic handbooks.<br />I bought the book for my new iPad mini and as it is - it's nearly useless.<br />By buying this, you end up with a bunch of over 4000 numbered pages of text in digital format, just like you would scan the paper version.<br /><br />1. There is no clickable or expandable table of contents.<br />2. You can't do full-text search, actually there is no text search at all.<br />3. There are no hyperlinks, the Index section is also plain text - no clickable reference to the actual pages.<br /><br />Someone missed the possibilities that digital format gives and just took the path of the least ressistance.<br />I will be asking for a refund. If you are considering buying the kindle edition for your iPad, consider Inkling edition, which is a bit more expensive but a lot more useful.
0385344333|5.0|Book arrived when promised and my husband read this book in just a few days. Great story by a great author.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|Never received the book or a credit. Why doesn't Amazon have a customer service phone number?it is very frustrating leaving emails that are not addressed by customer service
B008MM9630|5.0|I usually play these types of games on a laptop- so having one this good on my kindle is awesome,!
0345803507|5.0|I bought all three of these books and couldn't put them down.  Racy, romantic and totally engrossing.  Be prepared for the WEIRD...it's not your average romantic novel.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of the gems that comes along every couple of years! An absolute delight to read. a combination of a thriller, full of humor, as well as a spoof on historical events. Brings to mind Being there and Forest Gump. A book you can't put down once you've started reading it!
B00004TS0E|5.0|Hands down, the best holiday movie ever.  This version is even better than the original.  I watch it all year.  I promise you'll love it!
B001FB4W0C|4.0|If you loved any season of Supernatural you will love this season just as much. Plus I got this season at a great price. Better than Walmart
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I thought the idea for this movie had a lot of potential, but none of that really panned out.  There were lots of introductions to famous historical figures that I very much wanted to become involved in the action, but they all promptly vanished before things could get good.  All in all, most of this movie reminded me of a ten year old's daydream in history class.  Lots of impossibly stylized action and waaaaay too much slow motion and camera rotation.  Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter went way beyond the satirical, irreverent cheesiness that I expected and ended up in a heap of eyebrow-raising, yet still mind-numbingly boring confusion.
B003L77GGK|4.0|Who wouldn't love these two sexy boys running around after demons. I love Supernatural been hooked since the first day.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|It was a well written book Erikson only gets better as an author as you progress through this series.  Granted I'm only on book 3 of the series but the 2nd book was better and the 3rd is shaping up to be better then the 2nd.
0805092447|5.0|Excellent condition and a wonderful book. It was as advertised and is being enjoyed by all who are reaidng it. Thank-you
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Like the title of my review says... what more do you need to know? If that one-line high concept doesn't hook you, this probably isn't the movie for you. If you're still not sure, ask yourself this: Did you enjoy [[ASIN:B001EBV0NU Mars Attacks!]] and [[ASIN:B000MF4O82 Starship Troopers]]? If so, then you will probably enjoy this. Just keep your tongue firmly planted in-cheek. The film pokes fun at Americans in general, Republicans in particular, and Sarah Palin specifically.<br /><br />Things you need to know going in: This is a \\"cult movie\\". It is the modern equivalent of the drive-in movies of the 1950s. It is essentially a fan-made film. The makers of this film had previously produced a smaller-scale project called [[ASIN:B002OKK2AW Star Wreck]]. Not a Kickstarter, but essentially produced and financed through an internet co-op initiative. There were tons of people involved in getting this to the finished product (check out those credits, and all those logos that precede the actual film!)<br /><br />So no, it's not a sci-fi summer blockbuster like you might see in your local cineplex. Made on a relative shoestring budget, but they got every penny's worth on the screen. There are something like 1000 FX shots in the movie. The last half-hour is just a big extended space battle sequence -- extremely impressive when you consider that Hollywood would spend tens of millions of dollars to make the same kind of sequence.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a fun way to waste ur time. it like a facebook game bit with out the annoying energy refill waiting. a good game but a little different from what u remember playing as a child

B009P5K4HK|5.0|This album contains an amazing collection of live tunes from the late, great Amy...<br />These performances are perfect, Amy is at the top of her game, backing band sounds very tight and at times very hard to tell its a live preformance.<br />The DVD is also amazing, Amy was one of a kind.... Album Inserts are also very good, with cute pictures and great stories...<br />great collection
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Quick read with some really clever, cunning twists. I enjoyed it and think it is a book for any reader.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time giving you a rundown of the plot.  Most likely if you're reading the reviews of this book you've already read the book details.  If you've read some reviews most likely you've had the whole plot outlined for you by the reviewer.  So here goes the review.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart. If you do not enjoy reading graphic details about murder, reading about adolescent sex, reading about Satan worship or reading about potential child molestation this is not the book for you.  Granted, I don't really enjoy reading about any of these things, but the author manages to write about all of this and make it a fascinating story.  The characters, for the most part, are not likable.  They are, however, inevitably human which makes the story that much more believable.  We all want a hero, but perfection is boring and I'd rather read about someone flawed. I gave this book 5 stars because it hooks you into the story right away, keeps you guessing at the end of every chapter and the buildup to what actually happened the night of the murder is superb.  My only suggestion is to read it in the day because it truly will take you to a dark place.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope were ever I go I play it. well I do have 2 kindles,but can any of u tell me how 2 beat leavel 24?

B009FOBMBI|5.0|It was a great purchase, available quickly and great sound quality! Three Days Grace FANS must BUY!!!!! or just alt-rock followers....
B007HACDLK|5.0|I pre-purchased this book ages ago and settled in for a cover-to-cover read today....neglecting everything around me.  Everything is in here with a rare bit of humor thrown in. And we are set up for the next one, that I hope is fast in the works!  Mitch is still in good form, other characters filling in around him.  I was afraid that recent books were painting Mitch into a corner, but I think fresh direction has been introduced and I can look forward to his future for some years yet.
0316187216|3.0|Abercrombie's \\"First Law\\" trilogy is among my favorite works of fiction.  As such, this current trilogy had big shoes to fill, which it mostly did, until \\"Red Country\\".<br /><br />It doesn't want for excitement or mayhem.  I was delighted to see the reappearance of Logan, shown here first as an older and apparently meek man known to others as \\"Lamb\\".  Since the end of the First Law trilogy allowed Logan an ambiguous exit, I was unsurprised that the author brought him back.<br /><br />But, this -- or at least, the author's treatment of him -- was ultimately disappointing.  Look, if you bring back a character like the Bloody Nine, a man so possessed and ruled by his history and name, yet you make him an older man well past his prime and clearly on the edge of his physical decline, there's really only two good reasons to do so:<br /><br />1. You want to give him salvation, and so so give him a happy ending.<br />2. You want to drive home that you don't do happy endings, and so you send him \\"back to the mud\\".<br /><br />\\"Red Country\\" does neither, and it's my biggest problem with the novel.  Once again, Logan walks off-screen.  To do... What?  Become be even older ex-warrior, hobbling around arthritically?  (Remember, he's already old here; it would be highly unbelievable to give him a second physical wind.) No, the only point of wrapping yet another novel (or god forbid, an entire new trilogy) around such a man as Logan, if you respect the characters and your fans, would be to pick one of the above two choices and make it stick.<br /><br />So, why not do it in THIS novel??  I suspect Abercrombie simply likes this character too much to bring himself to scratch him off the list, alas.  And that was a surprising cop-out for this author, who thus far has been fairly brutal about doing what was right for the NOVEL, characters be damned.<br /><br />All that said, it was highly entertaining, even if its plot felt a bit grafted onto the prior two books, and not a satisfying denouement for the trilogy.
1593083246|5.0|Starts off slow and it'd sure be pretty boring to be one of the characters in the book but this is an amazing book. Must read!

B007WFTFG6|4.0|My daughter enjoys coloring on this app for quite sometime. Does not auto-fill so she has to focus and concentrate more. I recommend for toddlers.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really like this case. It is true that the charging port is on the wrong side when you have the kindle in the way to use the auto<br />awake feature, but this doesn't bother me. Im not a fan of the auto awake just because I'm always nervous that it doesn't shut off when I close it. So I place my kindle with the charge port facing the outside and don't have to worry about the auto awake.

B007PZADLO|5.0|Train releases have always been spotty. Their catalogue has some great songs but disc by disc they are not steller. Actually prior to this I thought Drops of Jupiter was their best overall release. No longer. Initially I simply downloaded this but it's pleasure level demanded a purchase. My first introduction was Drive-by, which I still am not tired of listening to. This'll Be My Year and 50 Ways to Say Zgoodbye are equally as enjoyable.<br />This is not virtuoso rock. It's melodic, lyrically fine. It makes you sing and sway as you listen too it. Too many current releases bring about nodding & naps so it's always great to find something that awakens the desire to get involved in the lp (I bought it on vinyl).
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|One of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. Chris Hemsworth is pretty much the only person that is watchable. Save your time and money, trust me.

B0000CDNWE|4.0|This was a great movie. It was about a Maori Tribe in New Zealand. The 1st born son had a set of twins a boy and a girl, but the boy and mother dies at childbirth only leaving the girl. Her name was Paikea(Pai) and her grandfather(Koro) was very upset that the boy died because he would have been the 1st born of his son therefore able in their tradition to become the chief of their tribe. Pai does everything she could to win her granfather's love and acceptance, but he was distant towards her. Koro started an all boy school to teach the boys all about the tribe and to teach them the songs and dances. Pai was very upset when Koro would not let her attend the school. After watching Koro train the boys and her uncle helping train Pai she felt she could be the chief of their tribe.  This was a little difficult because in the Maori tribe only males can be the chief. Pai's father refused to be the chief that's why his father Koro was looking for a male leader. After training the boys Koro took them out to sea in a small boat and threw his necklace with a whale tooth on it (from the whale their ancestors rode to safety on). None of the boys could get the necklace from the deep waters. Koro was very hurt and upset. One day Pai was near where the place where Koro threw the necklace, she jumped in to get it. She came back up with the necklace and a lobster. Her grandmother and uncle did not tell Koro at first that Pai retreived the necklace. Pai said a prayer for Koro that made the whales wash up on the shore by their home. Koro was angry and blamed Pai for it. Koro and the tribe tried to get the whales back in the water but was unsucessful. Pai went out to the water and the biggest whale she went over to and started praying and then she got on his back and the whale started going back into the sea with the other whales following. Pai was on the whale's back and rode out into the sea. Pai almost died. Her grandmother then told Koro Pai was the one the got his necklace out of the sea. Koro felt very bad for ever doubting her. She then became the chief at 12 years old. She was the first female ever chosen. Koro was very proud of her and then they rode a giant canoe out to the sea to celebrate her new position. This relates to World Religions because they were part of an indigenous religion and they also had many statues that they worshipped and they also had certain ways to greet each other. The main way was when they seen another member of the tribe they touch noses.

B007WA56SC|3.0|As a Kylie \\"stan\\", there is never enough of Kylie. To satisfy me, would be to box every single in existence that she's made, complete with B sides and untouched remixes. To push more, would be to include rarities like If You Don't Love Me in that box too. And the booklet would be filled with every artwork from every album in a4 size. Hey, that's just me.<br /><br />According to a press release, the songs selected for The Best of Kylie Minogue were chosen by \\"fans through extensive market research conducted by EMI late last year.\\"<br />- said Wikipedia<br /><br />These fans should be slapped. The Best Of Kylie Minogue doesn't include Come Into My World, which earned her a Grammy, and no single from her hugely underrated Impossible Princess. And the closest people in my life know Kylie from Especially For You. Is that even in the album? The booklet was disappointing and you'd think they'd be nice enough to include Timebomb just for fun.<br /><br />I don't want to be too negative though, this is pretty much the best of Kylie irregardless. Just look at the back cover art, filled with the original singles' fonts. Who does that? Only Kylie. Plus, it's universal enough for average Kylie \\"fans\\" (who only knows a couple of Kylie singles) to truly appreciate her. Kylie's been here for a quarter of a century. This album is enough to show you what she's made of.... for now.

B009439HEY|5.0|Genesis Revisited II is Steve Hackett's second (or third if you count the Genesis Files release) pensive if not nostalgic journey back to the classic era of Genesis when they produced some of their most endearing prog rock classics considered by many to be the band's magnum opus with Peter Gabriel as the band's frontman. Not their most popular era, which came later, but at the time, John Lennon was asked what he was listening to and he responded, \\"...Genesis.\\"<br /><br />Backed by Hackett's very tight touring band, he is joined by several other stellar guests of the contemporary prog rock scene, most notably Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree fame, Neal Morse of Spock's Beard, and Steve Rothery of Marillion. Each lend their exceptional talents to such works as \\"Shadow of the Hierophant,\\" \\"The Lamia,\\" and \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed,\\" but all-in-all, it is Steve Hackett's guitar genius that stamps the album's soul.<br /><br />The production is crisp, strong, and peppered through with Hackett's tell tale arrangements and definitive sound. The songs do not venture far afield from the original Genesis sound but are just slightly askew to please both old and new Hackett fans...and yes that is Collins on \\"Supper's Ready,\\" Simon Collins that is...Phil's son.<br /><br />I've been living with this album in my car since its release and it has not grown old or trite. Hackett and those joining him give a new richness to these timeless tunes and they are a joy to listen to.
0446580848|1.0|I have read all of his works from Cathedral through half of the Panther. The book could me made significantly better by deleting about half of the narrative.  I found it easy to put down and so I quit at page 450 because nothing interesting or meaningful was happening. I will read the Readers Digest version when it comes out.

B008K5T5AI|5.0|So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed Iain M Bank's science fiction novels, whether in the Culture series, or otherwise.  The universe that he has created is extraordinary.  His invention of technologies that just might exist in our own future is incredible, presented in such a convincing style that the reader fully understands and accepts their existence without hesitation.<br /><br />The story in this novel is a minor affair;  nothing earth-shattering or mysterious.  The premise gently fades in at the start and fades out at the end, with little drama or consequence.  Its what is going on around that storyline that kept me riveted:  the concept and consequence of a species evolving to a higher plain;  the politics of the various factions of the future galaxy;  the effects of having \\"multi-consciousnesses\\" of an individual in existence at the one time.<br /><br />I don't think its overly important whether or not you read the Culture series in the order that they were written, so you can certainly start here without loss.  I cannot recommend it more highly.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Quick read with an interesting scientific perspective on what lies ahead for everyone.  A different perspective from many similar accounts of life after death.

B009E2WX3W|5.0|Peter Gabriel continues to amaze and delight with his particular vision.  25 years seems like yesterday.  The live concert tour this past September only confirms this albums place in rock and roll history.  The sonics on this re-mastered album make this even more of a listening pleasure.  The visceral charge is as immediate as ever.  Great stuff.

Every number is artfully done with Susan's beautiful, emotive voice and impeccable delivery in top form.  The orchestral accompaniment is also excellent throughout complimenting and showcasing Susan's voice to perfection.<br />However, A Warning Label might be in order regarding some possible side effects from listening to this CD; such as, goosebumps, teary eyes, breathlessness, bliss and overall feeling of euphoria.
0596007124|5.0|This is so much easier to read than the GoF book.  The illustrations and exercises, while cheesy, were very effective at portraying the concepts and at helping me really learn design patterns.  Another great thing is that it also taught good programming guiding principles, and when not to use patterns.<br /><br />This book has helped me immensely.

B009KHBDUU|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, even though it was mildly yawn-worthy.  It's like Disney meets vampires and witches, rather than the dark comedy of the original series.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for something to watch and can't think of anything else to see, and if you like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton style movies.  It's not Beetlejuice for sure, but it's also not terrible
B000KX0IOA|4.0|Gandhi<br />  This was a very educational movie.  It shows how the Hindu's, Muslims, Jews, and Christians at one time all lived together and got along.  Gandhi was a very brave and intelligent man.  He did not let anyone change his mind on his beliefs.  He believed in non violence and even if someone harms you not to retaliate.  Gandhi's journey started in Southern Africa when he seen that Hindu's and Indian people were treated like slaves in their own country by the government.  Gandhi burned passes that they were supposed to carry everywhere they went.  After this he gained many followers.  Gandhi did not feel he was better than anybody else; he cleaned and worked hard like everyone else.  In Southern Africa Gandhi taught the Hindu's to stand up for what they believed in but never to use any violence.  Gandhi then went back to India.  That is at the time the British government controlled India.  Gandhi wanted this to be changed.  He believed they should be able to control their own country.  The British government would always have Gandhi arrested whenever he would march or speak.  Gandhi did not care about going to prison for what he believed in.  Gandhi thought that poverty was the worst form of violence.  Gandhi's wife followed him everywhere he went and believed in what he taught.  Gandhi believed in freeing yourself from all possessions and passions so that you can get closer to God.  This is the way he lived for many years until he died.  Gandhi had a choice between Independent India and Pakistan or a Civil War.  This is when Muslims and Hindu's started fighting and not getting along with each other.  When the fighting continued Gandhi started fasting and would not eat anything until the fighting stopped and he almost died.  Once the fighting stopped, Gandhi started eating and got physically better.  Shortly after that he was shot and killed in front of many people.  This relates to World Religions because this was about the Hindu's and the people in India.It shows how India was divided by the religions (Muslims and Hindu's).  That is when Pakistan was formed.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|Once again the idiots who run NBC, and in this case, Syfy, have started you down the path on a new Sci-Fi show that took some time to get going, and was shot through the heart and killed as it got really good. I would give this 5 stars because of the entire series, this season had some of the best episodes, and the story finally picked up pace and really became very good.<br /><br />But I want to rate it zero stars, because this show was canceled by the Syfy channel on a cliff hanger, they knew this in advance, and still did not even have the decency to do one last final episode to tie up loose ends. For that reason, I would like to rate it zero (have to give it 1), because if you watch this, you will be screaming at the end of the last episode knowing that you will never know the outcome, never know what happens, and be left with a giant cliff hanger. Actually, in this case, it is Syfy Channel that has tossed, once again, their viewers off that cliff without so much as a second thought.<br /><br />So I say skip this series, it will just leave you wanting so much more, and you will not get it. I also, like others here, have stopped watching the AWFUL Syfy channel, and cannot encourage you more to NOT support their products or advertisers. This is not the first time a channel, which is supposed to be dedicated to Sci-Fi programming has canceled a show early without warning. They now show wrestling, grade C movies, and reality shows based on bogus science. Isn't that the reason UPN went off the air?
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Does this book intentionally have misnumbered and missing chapters? I downloaded it to my Kindle and it starts at 2, then goes to 3, 5, 7, 11? Is it suppose to be like this? After posting my original review, I find out that yes, the chapters were numbered this way intentionally. Wish this had been brought out in the description of the book or in one of the other reviews. Seems the author numbered his chapters using prime numbers. There are no missing chapters. The book is awesome, by the way!

I tried two different copies of this blu-ray and encountered the same malfunction, which was major distortion in the 7.1 DTS audio of the film itself.  Back to the regular DVD release for me: some technical advancement is functionally a step backward.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|I purchased this novel because of a very intriguing review I read in the Seattle Times, and I must say I got a winner here. I enjoyed reading every word and I have recommended it to many friends already.<br /><br />It would be mean to reveal the plot, but I think it's OK to tell you that it involves modern computer technology, the secret of eternal life, a quest Tolkien would have admired, quirky characters from various generations, a seemingly-unbreakable code, and a very satisfactory (if unexpected) ending. Set mostly in today's San Francisco, it's comfortable in New York City and on the Google campus as well. The author (who is male) has a delightful writing style, and has created characters you can definitely care about. Even the so-called villain is complex and multidimensional. The hero is somebody you know if you're under 30 and who could be your own kid if you're in your fifties. He's nice, he's funny, he's conscientious, he's determined to complete his Quest, and he's a master networker. You want the very best for this young man.<br /><br />This is no \\"matrix\\" situation. It has no violence, no gratuitous sex, no political stance, no dire warnings of the future. All this said, it's far from dull!<br /><br />I believe it's remarkable when an author can produce a work that blends a beautifully imaginary world with a modern technological one. Sloan not only has done it, but has done it with grace and style. I predict this one will be a classic along the lines of Tom Robbins' \\"Another Roadside Attraction\\", William Goldman's \\"The Princess Bride\\" and Douglas Adams' \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". There will be a whole culture of people who will be speaking to one another in quotations from this intriguing book. I recommend you lose no time in becoming one of them. Have a good time.

B0033VUH6A|2.0|I'm not sure why anyone would think this was a good movie. After Jarhead I decided that current war movies were total garbage. I only watched this one because of an interview I saw with the author (or was it the producer?) on The Daily Show some time ago. Mistake.<br /><br />Whatever happened to the days when a war movie was inspirational, dramatic, and about heroism? Like _Saving Private Ryan_.<br /><br />Some people on Amazon don't like my reviews. Too bad. In the final analysis, this movie is primarily about a guy who's gone so far over the edge as a bomb tech that he's unable to reintegrate into his life at home with his wife and kid. Everyone else in the movie is as a second thought, unmemorable, and mere cannon fodder. How about a better movie where you develop a real emotional connection with the supporting actors, and an ending where the main character gets the help he needs to reintegrate with his home life, free from his addiction to adrenaline? If you like movies that end well, don't bother with this one. (And don't bother to reply. Instead, write your own review). ... FWIW, my son is an Afghanistan war veteran.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|I gave this as a present to someone I liked it o much. It has a slower pace, but I'm used to foreign films with slower paces so this didn't bother me at all. Not that this is a foreign film. I like the mind games the film plays with the viewer. Is the main character really going insane or is he really having real visions of an apocalyptic tomorrow. Admittedly, the plot is thin if you stare at it too long. What carries it is the acting. It's all about the acting. If you want to watch really  great acting that catapults a so-so story into a convincing great story this is it. None of the actors are slouches but Michael Shannon really shines in this one.  This is a great one to buy for all you out there who like to shut off the lights, snuggle with the popcorn and watch a slightly disturbing fable or two.

B000GCFO0I|2.0|First of all, I would like to say that I love bad horror movies. After seeing the second movie I was expecting this movie to be just as bad, but it wasn't. This movie actually had some things going for it.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The camera work is superb, I never really felt like it was awkward or bad in any way.<br />The acting is, for the most part, very good. I felt like the main actors really got into their roles and played them to the best of their abilities.<br />The CGI is very good. When the town falls under darkness I really enjoyed seeing the walls flake away.<br />The monsters, especially Pyramid Head, are very nicely done and help with<br />the atmosphere, which was also very nice for the first half of the movie. Even though this is a short movie I was (at first) able to believe that there was more to Silent Hill than I was seeing onscreen.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The writing is...well...if you've seen it you'll get what I mean even though it might not have occurred you. The writing consistently plays the victim of plot convenience. The first time our main character encounters monsters, she has the opportunity to run away but gets confused and runs the wrong way. She then stumbles as the monsters converge on her, but wait! It just so happens that the monsters just disappear! This happens every single time the main characters get into a major situation in this movie. The monsters trap them, but then they disappear because that's what happens. They never fully explain this either. All we know by the end of the movie is that some form of praying to an unidentified god by some random cult happens and then the bad stuff just disappears, though even this isn't fully put together for us. This doesn't help the atmosphere later in the movie either, since once we know that the darkness doesn't have a very good explanation it just feels random and un-scary. More on the plot conveniences below.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I could classify this one as monsters or camera work, so I'm just going to call it catering to fanboys in the wrong way. Anyone who knows anything about Silent Hill knows that Silent Hill was scary because of that \\"I wonder if something is behind me\\" sort of feeling it gives you at all times. This movie seems to take this approach at first, but then just leaves it in the dust. The only genuinely scary part of the film is a part where our protagonist, Rose, locks herself in a bathroom and finds a dead guy in a bathroom stall. I won't say what happens, but the atmosphere is tremendous. It then screws this great atmosphere over only a minute later! A monster appears, and while this in itself is great, the camera stays focused on the monster repeatedly. The camera angles themselves were fantastic, but the protagonist just stands there and looks at it so that the writers can cater to Silent Hill fanboys by keeping a \\"scary\\" monster on screen. Rose then just runs out the door (that was just locked?) and leaves. It's not that hard guys! Just quickly show the monster (not showing us what it looks like in detail so that we are even more scared of what it might be), give us a sense that she is being chased by it, and make us really scared with those great camera angles that you keep using! Simple!<br /><br />This movie also sports the most useless character in any movie I have ever seen: the cop. Notice that I did not say she was a forgettable character, but that she was just completely useless. She is literally forced into the plot on many occasions and near the end does some of the most stupid things imaginable. She notices Rose's car at a gas station and sees her daughter inside of it. She asks Rose is everything is okay. Then she doesn't just follow Rose to Silent Hill, she tries to pull her over on the way there! WHY? This is never explained and all we know from this point is that the cop doesn't like Rose, until she does like Rose, and then she conveniently likes Rose. Even if Rose had just met her, and then the cop just found her suspicious and followed her to Silent Hill that would be better. But there was literally no reason to forced her into the plot the way the writers did. The only thing she does in the whole movie that is worth anything is when she pulls Rose out of the way of the darkness when Rose was (conveniently) to stupid to move out of the way. She crashes her police motorcycle and receives only a small scratch above the eye (this might sound silly, but if you watch the movie you'll see how stupid this is based on the MASSIVE headgear she is wearing on her head) and she isn't hurt otherwise. She also gets acid sprayed all over her front, and even though she takes off her headgear and nice leather jacket (just because it's a leather jacket doesn't mean that a motorcycle crash wouldn't damage it...) but her face just lucky avoided the acid (that was everywhere around her face...).  She later easily fights off three cultists, before (conveniently) not being able to fight well anymore. I'm not even joking. She doesn't just take a hit to the face and get disorientated or something, she just pulls the most USELESS \\"I'll stay behind\\" move I've ever seen, and then (conveniently) loses both the desire and ability to fight. WHY? She doesn't even slow the cultists down because THEY WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO CHASE ROSE!<br /><br />I think I've said enough. This movie suffers from an extreme case of plot convenience and really doesn't make sense in a lot of places. It really kills the atmosphere later in the movie and it's a shame that the writers decided to continue the same story line in the newer one., and then the cop just found her suspicious and followed her to Silent Hill that would be better.

I was like this during ever Percabeth moment.....*Drool*Drool*Drool*Drool*Drool*FANGIRL!!!!!!!!!!*<br /><br />Pretend I'm Annabeth................I.LOVE.YOU.PERCY.JACKSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Percy was genius. Making Rick Riordain a genius for inventing him. It's a fact of life. A universal truth. Get it? Got it? Good. I love him to death. But then we get a new perspective in this book that we have been waiting for for about 7 WHOLE BOOKS, named.....ANNABETH!!<br /><br />Annabeth's has like this totally legit DNA code that is named: \\"Awesome-Sauce\\". Seriously. After waiting and waiting and sensing the awesome vibes coming from the girl we finally get it. And she is better than you think. I can't even think of descriptive words past EPIC. She is so strong in character, her thought process just bowls you over -sheesh girl you can THINK! -she's smart clever, funny and just so amazing. The character development that she goes through is incredible, and her quest is just made of EEEEEP! (Confession: It felt really short and almost too easy for Annabeth up till the end.) Seriously guys. Need i say more? I read so fast if only to get back to her chapters. I mean each chapter  that had Annabeth's signo on it was like........*fangirl-hands-at-the-supreme-awesomeness-of-her-brain* ANNABETH HAS OFFICIALLY ROCKED MY SOCKS OFF. But moving onto Leo........<br /><br />Guys, Leo is my 3rd favorite. He's got this extremely funny narrative voice that you can't help but love. He's on his own and going through his own struggles, but he comes through them with incredibleness that shines through his personality and humor. It's so hard NOT to love him. You just can't! He's a mechanical genius, with self-confidence and a witty response to pretty much anything. TEAM LEO! That leaves me with one more narrative voice to address....PIPER.<br /><br />Piper doesn't deserve any fangirl actions. I'm sorry to all you PIPER likers, but I'm about to confess that I don't care for Piper......or Jason. Jason feels like a robot copy of the Percy Jackson from the earlier books but with different powers. Piper, has no depth. Sure she can \\"charm-speak\\". (PUH-LEEZ.) But how is that gonna save them from schizophrenic gods and Mother Earth? It barely worked in this book! That's all I will say. It was a chore to read her chapters, she can have Jason and elope into a cloud kingdom for all I care. The. End.<br /><br />But there were some other notable awesome characters that I feel deserve a completely random fangirl session for their awesome-tasticalness. Namely: Reyna, Hazel, Ella, Frank -YO MAN!- Coach Hedge, and ARGO. I hereby dedicate this fangirl session to your memory: *LIFE'S WHAT YOU MAKE IT AND YOU MAKE IT ROCK. THERE WOULD BE NO POINT IN LIVING IF YOU WEREN'T THERE TO TURN INTO A GIANT KOI FISH FRANK. I WOULD NOT FREAKING CARE ONE THING ABOUT THE ROMANS IF YOU WEREN'T THE MOST INTERESTING PRAETOR EVER, REYNA. DEAD GIRLS ROCK!!!!! HARPIES THAT READ? WHERE CAN I GET ONE?

I don't really think I have to say that it was another AWESOME plot full of reveleations, secrets, and Monsters. Not to mentions schizophrenic Olympians. Yikes! Other than the fact that the style seemed to start following that traditional pattern, I have to rock on to this FANTASTICAL story.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie very much. A funny story about people and the strange ways they behave.
0765356147|5.0|OH MY MISTBORN!!!! This is one SMASH-BANG trilogy full of AWESOME-SAUCE characters, adventure, danger, villains, romance, action, magic.....EEEP! I have loved following this intense series and must declare it the BEST High-Fantasy I have read since Lord of the Rings! And since LOTR is my FAVORITEST book ever, that is a very high honor. ;)<br /><br />I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. Honest. I don't know where to begin. This book was a roller coaster of epic fun, and emotions for me. The writing was just incredible. I'm so amazed at how well Brandon was able to craft a novel and weave in so many twists in a plot.  He is so good and forshadowing and leaving hints that you don't pick up! Things you pass by in the FIRST book now show up again in the third and it's just.. WOW. High-five to Brandon. Yes, I've heard people complain about how long the book is, but it worked for me. It was informative in a way that didn't drown me. It rocked.<br /><br />The characters as always were incredibly done. We get quite a few points of view and it really adds layers and depth to the story that we couldn't get if it was just one narrator. So I felt it was really well done. Some of the characters had previously undergone their development, and so they were strong and amazing, while a few newer POVS, had not. It was all so great to learn about the cultures, and powers of the whole world from all these characters. I just love the cast that Sanderson has created.<br /><br />The magic and the plot was superb! It all comes rushing together in a climax I will never forget. Honestly guys, I cried for TEN MINUTES. I'll never forget. I don't want to say to much except that I found myself really sad (and even mad for a few minutes) about a few things that happened, and surprised but okay. It all worked out fine and splendid and....WOW. I'm really gonna miss these characters. I still think about them a lot and wish I could hop into the pages and become one with them.<br /><br />SO. The Morale is: READ THE MISTBORN TRILOGY. You will never, ever, ever regret it if you do. Actually you know what? Go to Amazon right now and buy the trilogy. Then when it comes in the mail you can hibernate for the next two weeks (these are not light reads) then when you emerge into the blinding sun, we can FANGIRL together! I won't complain if you only buy the first book though. Cuz once you start, you'll get them all anyway.<br /><br />Content: Mild/Moderate-Clean to me<br />(Swearing - he**,da**,bloody, swearing on Lord Ruler and Mists. Violence and Fighting. Quite a bit. Somewhat  gory details (guy author-go figure). Some kissing.)HE MISTBORN TRILOGY. You will never, ever, ever regret it if you do. Actually you know what? Go to Amazon right now and buy the trilogy.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I think the app store should give us the angry birds star wars for free.  please give us the app.
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|I'm unable to use Photoshop Touch without having to be signed in to Amazon. How can I use this app when I'm not connected to WiFi? It keeps prompting me to log in to Amazon.
B009DQQF7Y|4.0|As a big fan of GYBE, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had just released their first album in 10 years. Like most of their music, it takes several listens to really start to capture all the subtleties and genius of their compositions. Probably the first track is my favorite. It's fierce and has a strong Middle Eastern/Israeli flavor. Their music takes me places that few other pieces of music do.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book kept your interest and it was hard to put it down.  It seems like everyone is reading this trilogy.  The author definitely has an imagination.  I'm glad I read it on my kindle.  There were a lot of definitions I needed to look up...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this installment of the Crossfire novels. This series is just as good as the Shades of Grey series. If anything the continuing story is even more enthralling. Can't wait for next book!
B00917IQFY|5.0|I'll make this short. As good as anything GP has done. I can't find a weak track anywhere. I can't get these songs out of my head. Classic GP & Rumour!
159315724X|5.0|Wow this book is amazing! It is funny, honest, not too big and really learning. Great book!<br />I am learning a lot and I would recommend it to everyone.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This isn't a movie full of plot twists, or even particularly good writing. The characters are just well enough developed to make them endearing, but not well enough to throw you any surprises. The actors (Portman, Kutcher, and Klein, particularly) are overqualified for the sometimes strained lines that they deliver, and the jokes are (mostly) corny and easy, but there are more than a few that will still make you laugh out loud. That being said, this movie is better than the above would make it sound. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Natalie Portman, but this movie is cute to the point of redeeming. The plot doesn't have to have twists, its a romantic comedy. This film is as advertised, for sure. It will make you laugh, and say \\"awwww\\", and try to snuggle up closer to the person you're watching with, but isn't that exactly what you wanted?
B009VB7P6G|3.0|My nine year old enjoyed this movie. It didn't seem to deep but the themes were appropriate for her age group and she was captivated by it
0316228532|4.0|I, like many, loved Harry Potter and couldn't wait for Rowling's latest book to come out.  To say this book is very different from her previous work would be a massive understatement.  For a lot of the book, it seemed like Rowling was trying to prove that she could write adult fiction, complete with swear words and disturbing images.  I almost stopped reading this book several times, but something kept me coming back.<br /><br />Almost all of the characters are seriously dislikable.  They think mean thoughts and do terrible things to each other.  But over the course of the novel, Rowling showed yet again that she is the queen of character development.  Slowly, the reader gets to know each of the many main characters on an intimate level.  You learn about their past, their relationships, their failed hopes, and their darkest secrets.  She makes these people real, flawed and depressed and true.<br /><br />Rowling also makes her readers have to contemplate and wrestle with difficult ideas.  How do we help the less fortunate in our community without creating a vicious cycle of poverty and victimhood?  How many chances should people get before their are labeled hopeless?  Rowling created a book that would be perfect for a book club discussion as it describes the great divide between men and women, parents and children, the rich and the poor, and the inside and outside lives of her characters.<br /><br />While I didn't always enjoy reading this book, I thoroughly appreciated Rowling's rich and elegant writing style, and her unflinching look at what makes each of us human.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|This movie was terrible. There was no plot to speak of and a ton of swearing and nonsensical nudity. Wish I hadn't wasted my time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|She loves it and my boys are having fun too. Ten more words to make it twenty for the minimum.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|It took me about 10 plays to start getting used to it... I like it better then Morph the Cat and Kamakiriad, but not as well as The Nightfly.<br />Favorites are Miss Marlene(dark subject but immediately liked it), I'm Not The Same Without You, Memorabilia, Weather In My Head, and New Breed. The other songs I am getting used to. I don't particularly like \\"Out of the Ghetto\\", but I can't get it out of my head either, and considering it replaced the 1983 WECT Ch. 6 news jingle  in my head, probably a good trade.<br />Thanks Donald...
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is fantastic.I can not say how fantastic it is.It does not freeze up.It does not have pop-up-ads.It is so incredable.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I kind of like them but they are an acquired taste, much like the Black Keys. Retro sounds mixed with other wordly sounds makes for an unusual mix - I suppose that is why it is called &#34;alternative&#34; rock.
1439152802|4.0|This book did not disappoint! I have read a few other of Kate Morton's books, and while they can be tedious at times, they are worth it! I was bawling at the end, and at about 3/4 of he way through thought I had guessed how it would end. Boy was I wrong!  The characters were all well formed, and the writing was just what you would expect. I highly recommend.<br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because it was a little hard to get through some spots. I loved reading about the storyline going on during WWII much more than the present day storyline.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Wow this one was recorded LOUD! Stylistcally somewhere close to &#34;My Head's in Mississippi&#34; rather than early ZZ but if you are a fan you will like.
1416550550|5.0|This book was very well written. It spans three different time periods that you visit throughout the book with vivid details. There are many twists in the story and it keeps you glued to the page to see what happens next. It is easy to follow each character and time period. I loved the character development and how every small detail lead to the conclusion. I would recommend this book to anyone and I know that they will not be disappointed!!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I first tried the black and white version and loved it, so then got this version. Both versions are great and give a different challenge.<br />On the color version, you can't assume a blank space in between each number so this is an extra challenge.<br />Love the app and would recommend if you love challenging number puzzle games.<br />They also seem to be adding puzzles quite regularly so always something new to work on. Thanks!<br /><br />Overall the only suggestions to make both versions better would be to<br />1.) Have a way (maybe a button) to automatically fill in blank spaces for the entire row or column with x's once the number values have been filled in.<br /><br />2.)Add  an editor. This would be great so that people could add their own images as puzzles.
B000U6BT40|3.0|This tv series is funny and entertaining.  Can be a bit silly at times, but overall enjoyable to watch.  Has lots of sci-fi in the background plot.

B0012QRPU4|4.0|The show is riveting from the very beginning of each episode.  I have to prepare myself to watch it because it is so intense.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Do not want to say to much so as not to spoil anything.  I think I know several people like this. SCARY!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|One of the brightest lights i have! Would recommend to anyone. Has gotten me out of a few jams. Very handy to have.
0345803485|1.0|I was given this book by my sister who warned of it being \\"x-rated\\".  I finally got around to reading and almost put it down after the first page.<br /><br />Others have described much better than I how it appears to be written by a woman, perhaps sexually and emotionaly stymied in her life for whatever reason, and is attempting to self-heal by putting pen to paper.<br /><br />The sex?  eh, I've got that beat! Nothing surprising there. But, the insult is that the reader is to accept that a virgin would consider embarking on such a journey.  Is this proof that a woman can be swayed by shiny things?  Throw enough money and helicopters and planes at the virgin and she'll let you beat her up with a belt!  Sweet.<br /><br />The one thing that made me hate this book was context.  I hate when writer's don't use proper context of events.<br /><br />Example, hardly anyone who's ever replied to an email doesn't usually even see the subject line much less change it.  They're going back and forth and every time someone replies, they're changing the subject line????  Please.<br /><br />And here's the deal killer for me:  Grey takes Ana to an IHOP for breakfast after taking her gliding.  Ok.  She's besides herself that someone of his stature would go to IHOP.  Ok, she's impressionable.  He explains that he's always gone there and loves it.  Ok.  When he orders his meal he orders Pancakes with maple syrup.<br /><br />Now, I ask ANYONE who's ever been to an IHOP (or ANYWHERE for that matter), do you EVER order Pancakes with maple syrup???  Never!!!  Especially at IHOP when you've got 7 kinds of syrup right in front of you.  The syrup is a given.  Context.  Brutal writing.  Or, as the writer would say, \\"zzzzzzip, oh my\\".  Sheesh.<br /><br />AND ANOTHER THING......referring to her vagina as \\"her sex\\", is....simply innacurate.  Wrong.  And when used like this:  \\"His nosed gently brushed against my sex...\\"  It's just HORRIBLE!!!  Say the \\"P-word\\" for GAWD sake!!!!!  Just once....SAY IT!!!!  sighhhhhh<br /><br />As far as the plot, I could have helped it out.  I say that Grey's MOTHER should have turned out to be Mrs. Robinson.<br /><br />Now THAT'S nasty!!!!!!  :-)))
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is so STUPID the graphics are lame I feel like a dwarf when I play it I can't figure out how to jump its such a rip off buy minecraft it 1000. better its worth the 6.00-7.00 dollars to get it on pe this game is garbage not even worth downloading STUPID
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I won't bother rating the movies except to say that the first two films in the series revolutionized the action, horror, and science-fiction genres as we know it. Though the final two movies weren't as successful or critically-acclaimed as the first two, the entire series is great as a whole and Sigourney Weaver is strong throughout.<br /><br />This blu-ray set is awesome. The packaging is wonderful to look at and the discs are in pages like a book; no more having to fold out ten sections like in the previous Quadrilogy release. The movies look and sound great in high-definition, so much so that you'll see and hear things you missed in previous releases. The extras are also a real treat, boasting hours and hours of special features that will give you a very detailed look into the saga's spectacular mythology. I highly recommend this set to anyone that's a fan of the films or the science-fiction genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good times for young and old. kept the family busy for hours. must have for all ages. all skill levels
B008QE9VJI|3.0|If film's had emotions, Dark Shadows would be slightly confused. At times the movie is trying to be a spooky and gothic chiller, mixing horror with suspense. The next minute it's trying to be a comedy with old jokes and goofy attitudes. Depp, as always, is a pleasure to watch, the supporting cast is entertaining as well, but it just can't make up for the unevenness of the movie's tone. It's not a horrendous movie by any means but it certainly has issues. Check this one out if you like previous Burton and Depp films.
B009VB97EY|5.0|First time ordered a movie from Amazon, was very pleased.  Channing Tatum plays role great, no wonder he was voted Most Handsome Man in the World this year
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|Boasting a strong cast, Tower Heist is a entertaining and funny caper movie. The plot is fairly straight forward and easy to follow, if a little far-fetched. Stiller takes a detour from his usual trouble-ridden characters to one that's smarter and, in my opinion, more fun to watch. The movie is also a welcome return for Eddie Murphy, who has starred in a string of forgettable comedies for the last few years. Tower Heist is pretty formulaic and nothing ground-breaking but it's an entertaining heist flick that made me laugh.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The movie is a wonderful story about Jesuit missionaries in South America. Although the movie isn't quite honest: the missionaries did leave when the pope's legate required them to abandon the mission they'd built above the falls.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit describes habits in a way that will allow one to take control of his or her habits.  Anyone who is interested in self improvement or in a managerial position should read this book for the insights it provides into human behavior.  The only down side to the book was that it was slightly drawn out.  I wouldn't have had a problem if the author had used shorter anecdotes to get his point across.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I was disappointed with Fifty Shades of Grey - there was no real story line just lots of sex<br />In book two (Fifty Shades darker) a story was beginning to emerge but my books disappeared from my Kindle before I finished the book<br />I have not had the opportunity to read the third book ( Fifty Shades Freed) yet due to the above
030758836X|3.0|Admittedly, this if the first book by Gillian Flynn I have read. I will go back to read her previous two novels as well. She is a good craftsman, with a fast-paced, detail oriented and quirky writing style that is perfect for the suspensful plot. Nick Dunn and his wife Amy have had to give up their ideal yuppy life in NY to move back to his childhood home in a dying Missouri town to care for his dying parents, where he opens a bar with his twin sister. Infidelity, possible murder, and a very thoroughly planned revenge are developed in three sections of the book, told by his and her points of view.<br />Brilliantly constructed, real, intriguing characters, and a break-neck pace does end without satisfaction we really hope for, as is pointed out by many reviewers, but Flynn is the writer, they are her characters, and if she wants it to end that way, so be it. It may not be how it would end in a slasher movie, but it does work when you think about it.
B00008EYA5|3.0|SWAT isn't bad it does offer plenty of action and drama. The characters do work well together Jackson does well playing the leader who is tough but human, Colin is good at playing the complex maverick who seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Along with that Colin and Michelle do a good job at showing that their characters appear to be friends who seem to want a little more. The rest of the characters tie in well and assist dynamic of the team.<br /><br />A summary of the plot is: Jim Street (Colin) is a former SEAL and now working with the LAPD SWAT Team with his partner Gamble (Jeremy). Gamble is a adrenaline addicted officer who constantly disobeyed orders until it lead to his being fired due to disobeying a hold order during a dramatization of the North Hollywood Robbery. Gamble disobeying that order resulted in a civilian injury. Street following his partner ended up in the gun cage. Hondo (Sam) resturns to the LAPD SWAT and is requested to assemble his own team and he chooses his team and from here they must pass the SWAT tests for the captain to approve them. Meanwhile a criminal worth millions, Alex, is arrested for a broken tail light. He makes a 100 million offer to anyone who could free him and from there the team must get him to a prison where he'd be secure. The rest you'll have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Now the action scenes are not bad but they are also not the best i have seen. There are not anywhere close to the best i have seen. I would give the action a B rating.<br /><br />The plot is a little far fetched to say the least, i tend to think the police have the resources to get someone transferred safely even if there is a 100 million bounty. At some point i would think higher law groups would come in and forcibly take control and it would be over. However that wouldn't make much of a movie would it? One of the only other complains i have about the plot is i found myself begging for it to actually get started.<br /><br/>SWAT isn't a great movie but its also not a bad movie. I do like it!<br /><br />Overall i give SWAT a rating of 3/5 stars it is a good movie for those who like action and dont over think plots. It is also a movie those who aspire to be police officers or SWAT officers would certainly appreciate.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|This Cars movie is a bit older themed than the 1st Cars.  Good movie and the 3D is worth it.  With the multi-disk set have extra for the portable player too.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|Its hard to believe this movie is so old the first time i watched it was at a drive in. Do drive in movies even exist anymore?<br /><br />Anyway 2 Fast 2 Furious when it came out and i saw it i absolutely loved it Walker and Gibson worked really well together and Eva was her usual beautiful self. The acting itself wasn't bad and the movie itself was fluid and easy to understand. Many people were expecting it to reference the original more but i think this film was trying to be more like life. When caught up in a tough situation most people dont have the time to sit down and have flashbacks. While it is true the past will come up and bite you and people can dredge up the past this film was attempting to be like real life and not live in the past.<br /><br />The humor in this film consists of mostly one liners that will make you chuckled and laugh. Its a true action movie keeping the drama and moments where silly things happen that would deliver side splitting humor to a minimum. The car chases in this film are long and for the most part very eventful basically everything you would expect from a hollywood car chase.<br /><br />The plot is simple to follow and for the most part well pieced together. The cars in the film are cool looking for the period however i think street racing look of cars have come a long way in the years since.<br /><br />This film does have everything needed for a street racing film<br />- Nice cars<br />- Races<br />- Good guys<br />- Bad guys<br />- Car chases<br />- The law<br />- Shootouts<br />- An abundance of half nude women<br /><br />However even with all that those looking for this to be a sequel to the first one would be disappointed. This film should be looked at as a racing movie of its own right that makes few brief references to the first one.<br /><br />The film isn't bad, its fairly good 3/5 stars for those who aren't looking for a sequel. Those who are would likely give it a 2/5 star rating.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Not only is this a great movie for Marvel fans but the 3D looks great.  Extra disks to take to my non-3D friends houses too if need be, or for travels and the digital copy.  I don't really need all those disks but nice to have.
B00275EGWY|4.0|The Hurt Locker is a decent movie. As i stated in the title of my review, The Hurt Locker would most likely be enjoyed more by people without military experience because as the saying goes ignorance is bliss and if someone doesn't know better then they likely wont spot the inaccuracies.<br /><br />Frankly i go back and forth mentally on this film on how exactly they wanted to portray the U.S. Armed Forces and what they were trying to say about the military. I say this because of the personalities they portray of the soldiers.<br /><br />The plot is simple they are finishing the remainder of a tour and dealing with the day to day life of war. Along with dealing with Jeremy's character being a cowboy.<br /><br />The movie isn't bad not in the traditional sense if you detach yourself from logic and enjoy the trills and firefights and don't care about inaccuracies then odds are you will enjoy this film. However if your someone who just cannot overlook things and are able to spot the inaccuracies then you'll be annoyed with them every time you watch The Hurt Locker.<br /><br />Overall I'd say The Hurt Locker isn't bad, it certainly isn't a movie i prefer to watch either. I would say i have only watched it 3 times since i got it shortly after its DVD release. Its action and acting are both outstanding earning it 4/5 stars.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|-Joss Whedon's most recent film The Avengers is more or less the generic superhero movie but with the twist of it being based on a team of Marvel superheroes. The team is comprised of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and to a varying degree Hawkeye and Nick Fury. Notably, the majority of the team has their own movies already and I think it's safe to say that if you're unfamiliar with the Marvel mythos or haven't at least seen one or two of the other films you are at a complete disadvantage. I say this because I personally have only seen Iron Man and am severely lacking in my understanding of Marvel characters as a whole. If it wasn't for my moderate knowledge of Norse mythology I would have probably been even more lost.<br />-So let's assume that going into this film the audience had never picked up a Marvel comic before in their lives, was completely in the dark in regards to the Thor-Odin-Loki relationship and never saw Iron Man, Thor, Captain America or any of the Hulk movies. Not only would they have no idea about who half the Avengers were or their back stories but the several characters without movies of their own have literally no history given to the audience. Black Widow, Nick Fury and Hawkeye are seemingly important characters to the film and yet I personally had no knowledge of them prior to seeing the movie and still next to nothing after seeing the movie. In all actuality Marvel knows who their target market is and knows that the average Joe going to see and actually care about The Avengers will undoubtedly have a greater understanding of it than myself but still. If I was this lost there must have been others just as if not more confused.<br />-Now let's assume that back-story wasn't a key priority for Mr. Whedon and the Marvel people. All right, fair enough, it was a superhero movie after all so it's more about the plot, character development and of course the fight sequences. Well unfortunately the plot was weak beyond belief. How many movies, novels, games, etc. have to lay waste to New York City before the audiences realize,hey, we've seen this dog and pony show before.' But I digress.<br />-The films plot is simple: good versus evil. You can't really screw that up without trying but because it is so cliche, it does take a certain prowess to present it in a new and unique fashion. I can't say with a clear conscience that The Avengers did that. One does notice the World War II undertones, if they can be called undertones as opposed to slaps in the face. For instance, Captain America's flashback and the scene in Germany where Loki forces the crowd to kneel before him and the brief dialogue between Loki and Captain America, which follows. That scene was less than necessary and seemed to only be used to fuel the connection between Loki and Hitler.<br />-While the plot could certainly have been more avant-garde the character development was so slight and unrealistic that it may have not been there at all. While all the characters in the film are for the most part static there are two points of revelation. The first being when the team actually begins to act as a team and the second is toward the end once Loki has come to understand he has done something very wrong. This may be the lack of back-story, but I find it rather far fetched that the previously squabbling and bickering team would rally around the death of Agent Coulson as the link to unite against Loki.<br />-When it comes to the fight scenes one can't help but feel that they occur quite often and are nearly always overly exaggerated and overdone. I know it's a superhero movie so it is to be expected that there be some intense battle sequences but the one-on-one duels are sickening to say the least. It's almost as if those parts of the movie were made either to distract from the weak plot or used as entertainment for those of the audience that look for more brawn and less brain.<br />-The Avengers is a decent movie for avid fans of the Marvel Universe and those who enjoy a slugger film. However, it could have certainly been done differently and in a better way. The plot could have been stronger and character development could have been more evident than it was. After seeing the movie and writing this review all I have to say is I hope The Avengers 2 can avenge the first movie.
B00168OIOE|4.0|My 4 year old is obsessed with Monsters Inc. She tends to watch things over and over! I am not sick of this yet and that is saying something. Finding Nemo got old.... This is another fantastic pixar flick with very funny references adults will appreciate. Can't recommend enough.
014132161X|4.0|Different kind of children's story, written in olde speak.  A nice change from the usual.  It's a break from the grown-up books I've been reading so I can go back to them and enjoy them.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I thought this movie was really good, not great, but really good. I watched it three times in one week and still found myself thinking about it. There are a lot of layers here and the extra content does a great job of filling in the blanks. I can't wait to see where this goes and will be looking forward to Prometheus II.<br /><br />Crazy visuals, stuff that sticks in your head.<br />Great Story... explained a lot of the Alien loopholes.
B009DT98RK|5.0|He's so amazing and full of energy,great guitar play and his vocals too!<br />The blu-ray sounds and looks FANtastic and the bonus track about getting<br />his black beauty is a MUST SEE!!!
B0013FBS20|3.0|Will Smith deals with the deadliest variety of Zombie in this movie. You have your dumb slow zombies-walking dead, Your hyper dumb zombies-28 days later and every once in a while, You get the smart/strong/fast Zombies. Who better to face this deadly foe than Will Smith.<br /><br />Good Zombie flick, for sure worth a watch for any fan of the genre. Decent soundtrack, could have a little more low bass (admitted bass junkie.) Good effects with some crazy visuals.
B0063IH60K|3.0|My only complaint thus far is that I wish there were more backgrounds and card designs to give a bit more variety and fun. Yes there are ads but not a major problem for me as they tend to appear between games and do not become an interference during one.
B000V1Y43W|3.0|I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie, but I'm not one of them. It is for sure more entertaining than the average kids movie. I just can't get into it for some reason. If you are looking for a good Disney/Pixar movie I would recommend UP or WALL-E. If you want to make sure it appeals to kids, go for Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, any of the Toy Storys or Monsters Inc
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not liking it so far because it takes a long time to load. b<br />But mabey I will like it!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Wall-E and Up are my favorite Pixar movies. My daughters love all the pixar movies, but Dad is really happy when they pick this one. Great movie with adult themes running through it. This doesn't take away from the kid appeal as Pixar is great about making entertaining movies for all age groups. The soundtrack is top notch, some good low bass extension. The visuals really make my panasonic ae4000u shine.<br /><br />Great movie!
B007SGM084|2.0|Book 1 was great. Book 2 was lame. Book 3 was just disappointing. This was no literary masterpiece, its was simply entertaining. I liked how the story started but the ended was pathetic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So many twists. Really held my interest. Wanted more. Can't wait for book three to get to me. Great tension.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is really addicting it is on my mom's phone and my little brother plays it a lot so he is the one who got me hooked on this amazing game so anyone who wants to buy a good game flow free is the one to choose.

B008J05EL8|1.0|Ok, so you charge for the program (a pretty hefty fee) and then charge for basic fonts but the program doesn't work? Lol. Do you see your customer base hating you more and more? Nah, you guys obviously aren't reading the reviews or you would have fixed the problems already. There should be a Company Is Trying To Scam Me button to push. To those who have been scammed, maybe it's time to social media the hell out if this. Go to Facebook and Twitter and the rest of the sites and start tearing this apart so everyone knows it's a ripoff. Maybe even the news will pick it up if enough exposure is conducted.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I don't get it. Not the movie, but the people reviewing this movie. For the first time, in a long time, this is actually an original science fiction film. Sure, you have your basics, but the overall experience is something from \\"Alien\\" with it being a very dark sci-fi adventure, with twists and surprises and things of it's own. The acting was fantastic, especially from Brandon Fasbender as David, with only minor quarrels with some of the dialogue and characters, but overall very well done. The CGI is some of the best of seen in recent years, and the directing was nothing fancy, nothing \\"artistic\\" but there were no flaws either. If you're fan of \\"Alien\\" or \\"Aliens\\" and of Ridley Scott then see this movie. If you're a fan of movies in general, especially a good science fiction--which seems hard to come by these days--then you too should see this movie.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really great game.  Interesting and challenging.  I finished it and am playing it again and it is just as good the second time thru.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|One might watch the trailer and groan at the prospect of another \\"The Black Stallion,\\" but I have good news: this is not the same. Yes, both involve a ship sinking with one human survivor, and both have the survivor interact with animals while waiting for rescue. There is a key difference, though, that expands drastically with the final minutes of the film. In \\"The Black Stallion,\\" the animal is a horse, something humans communicate with around the world. In Life of Pi, the tiger gives us something completely different. A natural enemy, very willing to devour. I'll get to the important meaning later.<br /><br />As is evident from the dramatic trailer, the cinematography is overwhelmingly beautiful. In all honesty, you don't see the half of it in the trailer. While at first, it didn't seem likely to work in 3D, I've put that view aside. It's the best live-action 3D I've ever seen! One of the best scenes (for the full emotional effect), is seeing the ship go down as if you were right there. In fact, more than one scene were so effective in this way that I was physically breathless. A few times during the film, Pi encounters rough storms, and this is where another beauty comes through. The camera captures the movement of Pi and his boat so well, it boggles me. While other movies have moved from cut to cut in moments, giving the impression of a storm, these cuts last much longer and show a lot more. It's as if filmed on location, with no misguiding.<br /><br />Something you should know before you watch is that Life of Pi breaks into the topic of religion quite a bit at the beginning. Pi follows several religions. First, Hindu, then Catholicism, and Muslim, all at once. After the incident, it doesn't come up much, apart from a few overtones, but it's important to be aware going in.<br /><br />This is a film for slightly older audiences (13+) for the reasons of the ship's intense sinking, and for the complicated concepts of the film.<br /><br />To warn you, this last paragraph is a bit *SPOILER* oriented. Near the end of the movie, Pi tells another story, showing what the tiger represents. Suffice it to say that there is more meaning to this than surviving on an island with a horse and winning a race with him later on. I won't spoil any more, though.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a beautiful movie about survival and perseverance, in the midst of harsh, beautiful nature.graph is a bit *SPOILER* oriented.

B005WGBOZM|4.0|So, now we are left behind by Creator/Showrunner Frank Darabount who did near perfection with The Dead in Season 1. Will Season 2 be nearly as good, or was this a one-note show? I actually thought that quite a bit between those two seasons. And honestly I had to downgrade it one star for what I and most of my Dead fan friends thought started too talky and not nearly enough action. To be honest, about 3 shows in, I wasn't picking this show off my DVR first any longer. It got bogged down in a lot of feelings (and that criticism is fair because sure I expected a certain amount of expressed emotion in a series this real and horrible (in situations, certainly not in storyline, etc.). But whole episodes devoted to emotions and relationships, here is where the Dead teetered on getting soapy and after the stellar Season 1, it was a stark contrast.<br /><br />However, fear not! Somewhere around Episode 9 (Triggerfinger) and 11 (Judge, Jury, and Executioner) it found its original excitement and energy and got back on track. As I always do when reviewing shows like The Walking Dead,  I encourage you not to allow those under the age of 16 to watch it. There is a great deal of blood and gore (not for the sake of sensationalism, it lends to the reality of the situation of living under the constant threat of the \\"zombie virus\\" which has, in season 2, begun to sink in as reality for the characters as well). For people particularly sensitive to this type of action, well, I admit The Dead is not for everyone (I actually am not particularly fond of it myself). But the scenes are not done to pull in boys under 17. It is a full -fledged adult drama that I would put up against nearly anything offered at the movie theaters (in my opinion, in league with Homeland and Sons of Anarchy).<br /><br />I know money is tight now - which I am repeating in my reviews of all seasons of Dead - and I would not push a show I didn't think was worthy of spending it on. And DO yourself a favor and buy the blu-ray version. I'm actually going to add all three seasons to my Wish List on here. It would make great Christmas gifts for people like me who have watched it from the beginning, but also those you know who keep saying they'd love to pick it up but are too busy. It's the best of the best and I highly recommend Season's 1 and 2. For Season 3, go read that review. Enjoy!blu-ray version. I'm actually going to add all three seasons to my Wish List on here.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|I gave one star because I had to.  I didn't liked the book - it was boring.  The writing style was not good in my opinion.  John Grisham just has not written such blockbusters as \\"A Time to Kill\\", The Client\\", etc. for a long time.  For some reason I keep reading his books hoping his creativity will come back and I keep getting disappointed.<br /><br />jcd
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|Once again, I am adding my voice to already hundreds of reviews because it can't hurt the series or Amazon to have another avid fan rate it 5-stars. The Walking Dead isn't for everyone. I will start by warning you it is just about the most graphically gory show allowed on 1st tier cable. And if that gore was done for the sake of bringing in the teenage crowd, I would not watch it.<br /><br />So, let me try to convince you that if that sort of thing is always your basis for not watching a show, then not only are you missing the point, but you are missing arguably the best show on TV (at least as good as Homeland and Sons of Anarchy). The blood and gore is a function of the reality the people left alive after the \\"zombie virus\\" has decimated society and must endure to stay alive. It's not a perfect show, and occasionally I see things writers do for plot's sake, but those moments are few.<br /><br />When I first read that our hero, Rick Grimes is played by Andrew Lincoln who hales from London, England (just an aside, anybody else think between Canada, the UK, and Australia that the all -American actor is a thing of the past? ), I admit my jaw dropped. I am one of those who can honestly say I am an original fan. I have watched Dead weekly from the very first episode until last night's episode. Somewhere in the second season, I looked Rick up on Imbd and found out this great actor with that perfect Georgian drawl actually speaks with a fairly prissy English accent! (Which like most American women normally find quite sexy.) I cannot imagine what it must be like to be one of the actors on this set. All that to say Mr. Lincoln's portrayal of Rick is the standard all actors should aspire to. The cast is lengthy and in the first season changes out quite a bit. I'd like to name each one, but that would be ridiculously redundant on this thread.<br /><br />If you haven't watched the series yet, and can suspend your normal reaction to the goriness of Dead - seriously - start with this season (1) and enjoy TV so good, the fare offered at the movie theaters has very rarely surpassed this one. I have to say that Season 1 was genius in how real it stayed with characters, surroundings, and story. In my opinion, society would devolve into a very messy thing under these circumstances. As one who likes an apocalyptic storyline, I also rarely find any of them to be particularly good or realistic. The Walking Dead ALWAYS keeps it real. With characters you fall in love with, expect to keep tissues handy throughout the season. BUY IT! And do buy the best viewing (blu-ray right now) version of it. Makes excellent Christmas presents for fans and NEWBIES who keep saying they'd like to watch it but are too busy. You can't go wrong (knowing you are buying for adults - I personally would not let anyone under the age of 16 watch this - extreme adult content). I know money is tight for many people these days, and I would not push a show that wasn't truly top-notch for that reason. This one is already highly popular with (I hope) many seasons to come. Just an addendum here - the TV series and first season was Frank Darabount's baby. He completely stepped out at the end of season 1. But if you want to know the effect that had on Season 2 and most way through 3 - you'll have to read my reviews of those!  Season 1 - best of the best.

B009LK6JS2|2.0|I expected more. The flight model is very simplistic and not very realistic, and therefore not very challenging. I was able to land on the carrier the first time I tried. I was bored by the third.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Sad, tragic,funny,interesting and at times very technical.  I enjoyed reading this book. The who has always been one of my favorite bands and!  felt many of the lyrics were dark, sad, thought provoking and  i miss that element in todays music.  I finally got to check off a who concert Nov 2012.  They did not dissapoint,  they can still rock
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Awesome book, I initially purchased for my grandson and found myself reading it prior to giving it to him. Great read & I'm sure he will agree as well.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Not only did I buy this game over half a year ago, I've actually been playing it all that time!  I've looked at or tried all the flight simulators I could find and none compare. Though this app is billed as a game rather than a simulator, I think it is the best flight sim available. Face it, with its limited input capabilities, a tablet (or phone) is not ideal for flight simulation.  Once you learn to land all the aircrafts consistently, you'll find yourself \\"working on points for style!\\"<br /><br />If you love this game as much as I do, try Rortos' other game/simulator; Air Navy Fighters - it uses the same flight engine, so all your experience can be used to destroy targets.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great story!  Loved it.  Read it in 2 days.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend for Grisham lovers.  Superb.
B009OA57MI|5.0|I've been playing Rortos' other title (F18 Carrier Lander) for over six months and love it so much, I bought this app the day it was released.  It too is one of the best $2 I've spent for my tablet.  Not only can you run the built-in scenarios, but you can also design your own and also download them from other users.  You get a lot for your money and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I have.
0062183591|4.0|I had the opportunity to read Dr. Ariely's book, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty as part of an assignment in Carlow University's Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis [...].  We had the opportunity to watch companion videos that followed the text.  I found Dr. Ariely's book very easy to read and was able to complete it in three sittings.  I especially appreciated this in light of the accelerated nature of our program and my experience with how dry some texts can get.  He offers great explanations of his research as well as real life experiences to make the reader want to continue on with the read.  I have not read Ariely's other books; however, this does make me want to go and read his other works.    Ariely discusses the SMORC model:  Simple Model of Rational Crime and how it proposes that our decisions regarding honesty are made very simply through cost-benefit analysis.  Everyone is looking for their greatest advantage and that is how decisions are made as to be honest or dishonest.  He explains how that must not be the real world; otherwise we would likely lock our wallets in our drawer and hide our cash under the bed and be unwilling to ask for our neighbor to bring in our mail lest he steal it.  He illustrates how this isn't the case so something else must be at work.    Ariely then backs up his illustration with scientific research, which is of course our interest in the book as it backs up our scientific research course.  The SMORC model he states is based on three things:  \\"(1) the benefit that one stands to gain from the crime; (2) the probability of getting caught; and (3) the expected punishment if one is caught.\\"  One only needs to compare the costs with the gain and determine if the course of action is worth it.    During Ariely's numerous experiments there are some new insights into the dishonest mind for me that are revealed that did not follow my initial assumptions.  One was clearly the discovery thata lot of people cheat, but just by a little bit.  His hypothesis is that this allows us to cheat just enough to save face and still look at ourselves as basically honest people.  He refers to this as the \\"fudge factor theory.\\"  The remainder of the book tests the theory scientifically while changing variables in the experiments.  His findings are somewhat counterintuitive at times and are revelations to me.  He found that the amount of money involved in the cheating did not really impact the magnitude of cheating and was actually even slightly lower when more money was at stake.  He also found that the more something is removed from actual money the more susceptible it is to theft or cheating.  These were just a few of the revelations in his book throughout the ten chapters.  Unfortunately, the book seemed redundant at time as he continued to drill the fudge factor into our mind.  I think the book could probably have been shorter and more to the point and it seemed as if the final chapters that added positive outlooks were almost added on to put a positive spin on some information that to me seemed a little depressing at times.  It seems that everyone was cheating, but only by a little bit.    I still feel this book was an excellent read, especially for anyone in the fraud prevention, loss prevention, human resources, or management fields.  His insights and the design of his very simple scientific experiments gave new insights but also showed the importance of scientific evidence to overcome preconceived assumptions and bias.  I am already look for his other books and am researching Dr. Ariely himself, due to his extremely interesting story and his excellent lecturing ability.  I think you will enjoy it too!

The title sounds silly, so most people's reaction to this movie before they see it is \\"WTF\\", then they check the reviews, and say \\"NEXT\\". Thing is, this movie has really bad reviews primarily because the only ones that even knew the movie existed were the ones who read the book. My best tip for those who never read the book is WATCH THE MOVIE, SCREW THE REVIEWS!!!<br />My favorite part is at the very end when they go into modern day today, the person that appears there seems a little bit like a certain political figure to me. My friends and I ended up having an hour long conversation trying to pin point that out, it was cool.

B009B4ZEMA|4.0|Christina Aguilera's 2012 effort [[ASIN:B009B4ZEMA Lotus]] follows up 2010's commercial flop [[ASIN:B003G4DFRC BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)]]. While Bionic was cutting edge, many fans and critics chastised the album often characterizing it as copycatting  Lady Gaga and pop trends at the time. Lotus has some modern pop cues as well that could be characterized as `trendy,' but for the most part Aguilera is less manic and `cutting edge' than she was on Bionic, which is a pro for Lotus.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Lotus Intro\\" (produced by Alex Da Kid and Dem Jointz), characterized by synthetic vocal effects and urban aspects. \\"Lotus Intro\\" foreshadows that Lotus is definitely an `experience'. \\"Army of Me\\" is slated in R&B-oriented pop sensibility, playing to Aguilera's prodigious vocal strengths. The chorus inspires: \\"One of me is wiser/one of me is stronger/one of me's a fighter/and there's a thousand faces of me/and we're gonna rise up/yeah we're gonna rise up/for every time you wronged me/well you're gonna face an army...\\" Things get off on solid footing.<br /><br />\\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" hearkens back to Bionic, but sounds distinct.  It may not show off Aguilera's voice like balladry does, but it is a brief, enjoyable record produced by Lucas Secon. Alex Da Kid, Mike Del Rio and Jayson DeZuzio to produce the neo-soul stand out \\"Make The World Move.\\" Cee Lo Green guests, though has no notable solos given his limited feature. Think of [[ASIN:B000G759LW Back to Basics]]'s \\"Back in the Day\\" as a reference point.<br /><br />Max Martin and Shellback work with Christina for the first time.  \\"Your Body,\\" the buzz single seems somewhat too similar \\"Not Myself Tonight.\\" It's not too shabby to be fair, but both \\"Army of Me\\" and \\"Make The World Move\\" are better. \\"Let There Be Love\\" falls into the clich&eacute;s of pop more so than \\"Your Body\\" giving Aguilera an overt dance cut.<br /><br />\\"Sing For Me\\" epitomizes Aguilera's strengths; a mid-tempo ballad with solid songwriting. Aguilera slays incorporating her trademark grit and impeccable nuance. A dramatic key change towards the conclusion puts \\"Sing For Me\\" `over the top' in excellence.  Companion ballad \\"Blank Page\\" continues to show Aguilera's vocals in commanding form. The accompaniment is restricted to piano and synthetic pad,employing a stripped, quasi-unplugged feel. Aguilera emotionally connects with the audience on this cut.<br /><br />\\"Cease Fire\\" quickens the pace and adds ambitious production by Alex Da Kid.

B004SOR4H6|4.0|I really like the flexibility of this app. I do wish it was easier to navigate then it is. But I really do enjoy it. And use it a lot!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|No problems - excellent picture! Why do I have to add more words as I have nothing more to say?
B007N8RULO|5.0|I enjoy  playing this game as a break from constant reading. Had to figure out the tap system to move the cards, then it was good.
0071766588|5.0|This one is perfect, when I received it, I was so amazing that this product is as good as I imaged.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Eben Alexander makes a compelling case that there's more to life than meets the eye, but I think he presented the case in a much more concise and compelling way in his two Newsweek Articles \\"Heaven Is Real: A Doctor's Experience With the Afterlife\\" and \\"The Science of Heaven\\". In those articles Dr. Alexander gets to the heart of the matter and distills this book down its essential parts. That's not to say that the book is bad at all. Outside of the core, it is a hopeful book that may be inspirational for families dealing with patients in comas and for those who have lost loved ones.<br /><br />Any time you deal with a topic like this you're going to polarize people, but I feel Dr. Alexander does a good job of giving his perspective and the science behind his convictions. It reads a lot less than a religious book and more like a musing on the things in the universe that we just don't yet understand and my not be able to comprehend. Either way, I'd recommend reading the articles first, it may be enough for most people, and if you are captivated by those then the book does add to the story, just not the heart of it.
B003VANOFY|3.0|When I started using these things, they were by far the greatest headset i've ever had. The fit, sound, and usefulness with wireless is wonderful. But now I digress, after a month or two of use they started to \\"act up.\\" I get random buzzing, shrieking noises, they shut off and on when they want, sometimes they can't even be turned on or off, the buttons randomly stop working, and all when fully charged or even still plugged in. I know of at least one other person that gets the same problems with his, so i'm not sure if I just got unlucky as well or there's some faulty ones on the market. As a person that keeps boxes and receipts for this instance, this is the one product I didn't keep them for, so i'm not sure I'd even be able to return them. So for now i'll deal with problems until it's unusable and try to get my money's worth out of them. This product is definitely good aside from the recent flaws i've had. If you plan to try these, at least keep everything for a return just in case. Also hear the G35s are almost the same thing if not better but i'm not sure if they have the same issues.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Sony's PS-LX300USB Stereo turntable is a fairly good product in that it can sync to your computer system to record your older Phonograph records at 33.34 RPM or 45 RPM; but not 78 RPM. the sound quality is ok for the cheap price of the player. If your looking for a fully rich and in depth player then don't get is Sony product you'll be disappointed. Sony's driver in the accompanying CD is really made for Microsoft XP but will work under Windows 7. The software is very light duty and very much out of date with the current products available. Even if you have just buy the record player, you really don't get any help from Sony support staff on your questions about sound editing and quality. As for the turn table it's an A+ while the software is. D-.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not quite as much as the first two.  However, it was good to read how the story ends.  The ending when it was time for her to execute Snow was probably the best part!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Charlize Theron makes the movie better.  I didn't watch this movie because I'm not a Kristen Stewart fan, but she doesn't say enough to ruin everyone else's good work.  Special effects are worthwhile and the story rewrite is well done.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was not a terribly sophisticated movie, but it was extremely entertaining. I liked all the little historical tidbits. If you're a fan of vampire movies, and historical fiction, this one is right up your alley.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The latest installment of the Mitch Rapp series builds upon the previous stories and evolves the characters very nicely.  Rapp fans will love it and, if you haven't read any of them, I think you would enjoy this as well.<br /><br />Mitch journeys to Afghanistan to investigate the disapperance of a key CIA operative and quickly finds himself entrapped in a web of political and clandestine services intrigue -- the operative has apparently been kidnapped and a a significant portion of the CIA's operation is in dire jeopardy.  The plot evolves nicely and the character development is excellent -- the author is not content just to relate an action/intrigue tale, but takes the time to age the characters and build upon the cast in a capable fashion.  Much of the action takes place in Afghanistan or D.C. with a side trip to Switzerland.  Of course, being Mitch Rapp, there is a steady stream of violence and the bullets do keep flying.  One minor critique -- in the early part of the book, we're introduced to a nasty presidential appointee and her secret military lover.  There some foreshadowing that these will be major adversaries but not sure to what extent this is played out (or maybe that is what was intended).<br /><br />All in all, another outstanding effort and a solid read.
030758836X|1.0|I don't even know why I finished this book. The story had so many predictable twists! I wasted my time reading this book full of cliches.
B00866H7SS|1.0|Storyline is more or less the same as Fifty shades, predictable. boring. could have easily skipped through four or five chapters as nothing happens most of the time
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Good movie; the cast was fabulous - as you'd imagine - but the story didn't have much to it... lots of funny parts by themselves, but the overall arc wasn't dramatic or interesting enough. VERY predictable, which is fine as long as it's strong and there's enough around it, but in this case, not so much...
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the cooking, cleaning, decoration, mood enhancing pics. recipes and holiday ideas are totally easy to access. love the organization of the pins and the fact you can find just about Anything!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I love this author, but not her best effort. I found this book boring at times and a bit hard to follow. I hope the next installment is better;)
B009LK6JS2|5.0|the game is the I have ever. plaed in my life but the landing is hard (hhhhhaaaaaaarrrrrrrrdddddd)  /(hard) the best game in the world
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is a blatant ripoff of minecraft, so I suggest not supporting ripoff software. Please just skip this game.
B00198X0WC|1.0|Whats up with this movie? Never an anamorphic release.<br /><br />Fox lose the masters?<br /><br />May be the masters was stored by Edward Scissorhands after visit a knife grinder and need a lot of digital retouching?<br /><br />For last, when Blu-ray (2D/3D) comes to life we whant the extended cut, not the childish theatrical version.<br /><br />Thanks in advances.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I wanted to give 6 stars! Superb, catching! I will recommend to all who loves reading a good book! ;-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps the kids entertained for hours.  so many types of games to choose from even my youngest niece can enjoy the different games offered.<br /><br />.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another great read from Nelson demille.  He never disappoints.  I am enjoying it very much.  Can't wait to see how it ends
0061537934|5.0|Whether you are a dog lover or not, this is a great story.  If you are a dog lover, have your tissues ready.
B008GOAEOE|5.0|This is by far the best edition of this album, I couldn't believe my ears! I also have mono version in my collection and this two are definitive for all music lovers. Greatly pressed at QRP on heavyweight 200 gram vinyl. Fabulous mastering on 45rpm.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Worst 2 books (Book 1, Book 2) I have read in years.  Would like to give No star at all. Boring, un-interesting, very poor writing style, tons of repetition. Why in the world is this book a best seller? Because of the repetitive sex scenes?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's ok to pass time I suppose. Most games aren't very sensitive to the taps, flicks and movements of the touch screen, which results in several attempts to make the required points to pass.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Ok so they are dancers..there is no real plot line and the resolution was kind of out of the blue.
B009H442DG|5.0|This album is just amazing. The song selection is great, the arrangements are fabulous, and OLIVIA and John sound awesome! This is a real Christmas album. Sorry Rod, but you just can't compete with Olivia and John. I've been listening to this album for a week (and it's still not Thanksgiving), and as soon as I sensed the old fashion feel to this, I was instantly in the Christmas Spirit.<br /><br />I've read a few bad reviews, and you must keep in mind that some customers simply do not have good taste in music. This cd is not corny at all, like some critics suggested before they even heard the music. It is timeless and anyone looking for a good Christmas album will really enjoy this one!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is great movie that many will enjoy even if there's not surperhero fans. I can't wait for Avengers 2.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Great app to to enter into your account. i recommend it to all on all android devices. great for credit cards too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Had me hooked from the beginning and I couldn't wait to find out how the plot would unravel.  I enjoyed the twist at the end.  Anyone who has enjoyed her other books will certainly enjoy this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is pretty awesome to say the least. I used it throughout my travels and it always was my journal. since it allows you to use &quot;notebooks&quot;, I could write for hours. easy mapping for people of all ages.<br /><br />highly recommend :)
B005LAII08|5.0|I have to start off by saying how great it was for the women to be the focus of a story!<br /><br />We (my husband and I) noticed first thing that the male characters were really secondary to the central theme, and loved it!  So many Disney stories, and fairy tales in general, have women as the main character, but they still seem to revolve around the men in the story.  It was refreshing to see a movie told entirely from the point of view of women who weren't consumed by love, devotion, or duty to some male in their life (alive or dead), or some ideal set forth by said male.  Ultimately, these women were focused on long-held feminine ideals: freedom, peace, and the preservation of family (or clan).<br /><br />Finally a story told of the influence that women exert through intelligence, grace, dignity, and determination!  This movie made sure you saw the men hurrying to punch each other out , while the women made the biggest impact simply by crossing a room with dignity or by being eloquent.  Our history books often overlook the strength and influence that women have had throughout the ages, not by being warriors, but through sacrifice and diplomacy.  This movie reminds us that women have their own abilities, equal to and different from those of men, but just as amazing.<br /><br />This movie was literally overflowing with female influence: yes, some of it with cleavage, but most of it with long sought and hard-won skill, patience, and determination.  A valuable lesson for our future women!
B0086700CM|5.0|Excellent product! Perfect for my phone. Works, Free product when ordering the new phones, all I got to say about it..
B005PK56TA|5.0|Addictive, funny, scary...perfect entertainment!  And I'd forgotten how incredible Jessica Lange is!  It's a horror story about a family that moves into murder house&#34; but the characters are so developed that it isn't a scream fest but horror at it's best.  No one us entirely good, or entirely evil, but some know more than others about what is real and what is illusion.  Rent the series, watch and enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent product! Perfect for my phone. Works, Free product when ordering the new phones, all I got to say about it..
B009CYCF5I|5.0|P!nk has become my all-time favorite artist. Before this album came out i was pretty confident i wouldn't like it as much as Funhouse. But P!nk has topped herself yet again. Its a great album--get it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Excellent product! Perfect for my phone. Works, Free product when ordering the new phones, all I got to say about it..
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed this hidden object/puzzle game.  There were a couple of fun &quot; jump&quot; moments and the graphics are nicely done.

B007UW9WOQ|3.0|The movie itself is well-made.  It is an<br />insightful portrait of the man and his<br />philosophy.  What is surprising is that<br />so many people (including many reviewing<br />here) want to honor the perfectionism<br />Jiro exhibits.  Perfectionism is not a<br />gift; it's a curse.  It is important to<br />do things very well, to set high<br />standards for one's work.  However, in<br />the single-mindedness, obsessiveness, he<br />constant dissatisfaction of true<br />perfectionism...there is no real<br />happiness there.  A man who makes many<br />of his customers uncomfortable as he<br />does is only successful in that he makes<br />great sushi. Not for real people, not<br />for their enjoyment really (because he<br />doesn't speak of that or even encourage<br />it!) - it's about perfection in the<br />abstract.  A few, very brief moments on<br />the tongue.  Most humans would rather<br />have a very nice meal with comfort,<br />concern for their enjoyment, friends,<br />relaxation, a convivial atmosphere.  And<br />you can have great food and be very<br />successful without being a one-<br />dimensional tyrant.<br /><br /> This is a poor man who was abandoned, and struggled, and succeeded. Good for him, and inspiring on that level.  But his daily life<br />choices smack of incredible compulsion rather than true joy, except perhaps a stunted and maladapted<br />narcissistic version of it. He isn't<br />concerned about humanity or even individual humans, he is concerned with his own vision of perfection. And he no longer is truly creative...he does<br />the same dishes over and over again, and<br />seeks to perfect them through better technique. That isn't creativity - it's skill-building, like learning to play Brahms better and better, rather than composing anew.<br /><br />At the end of his life, he will have made great sushi.  And maybe (no, probably!) damaged many people in the process.  That is NOT a great life<br />legacy!<br /><br />BALANCE is a much better way.  For instance, is it not better to make very good sushi, and also be there for and play with your kids and grandkids, and maybe volunteer for a charity (how about for orphaned and abandoned children!), and enrich the lives of yourself as well as yourself in some other way than a very expensive - and very quick by all accounts - mouthful of excellent raw fish?<br /><br />And I know it is a Japanese cultural value, but pushing your sons into your profession, denying their own unique passions and proclivities, has NOT<br />historically led to happier Japanese men - or greater ones.<br /><br />Jiro has had lots of determination and worked hard.  He has made great sushi.  If that's the measure of his life, he is not a great man.<br /><br />Sacrificing everything else in life to make great sushi is not noble; in a way it's misplacement of a tremendous energy. He isn't a bad man either, but<br />he should be a role model or inspiration only to those who are struggling just to survive.  Those of use who have choices should aspire to be more.
B009A9BF5G|2.0|Out of 500+ concerts, this year's tour by Coldplay blew me away and jumped into my top 5 immediately.  I flew to Dallas to see the show and then to Tampa, it was just so amazing and I am not the world's biggest Coldplay fan.  I cannot explain the euphoric feeling that was at these shows, especially with the lit up wristbands.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is a complete let down.  I do not understand why people make concert films now that don't focus on one frame more than 2 seconds.  This Blu Ray could cause a seizure, as it basically snapshots of 2 seconds of different angles, audience shots and fireworks chained together for the length of the film.  I wanted to see the band play and I do like seeing the audience reaction, along with the stage show.  There were some amazing effects on this tour, and sadly you get to see tiny little clips here and there.  There's just no sense of cohesion to this \\"film\\".  I cannot get engaged with the band on stage because of the fast edits, nor can I get into the vibe of the audience for the same reason.<br /><br />It's a shame, because this is probably one of the best ours that will ever grace a stadium.  It could have been spectacular.  I was wondering why this wasn't a 3D film as well because of the Stage Show and the Xylobands, but now I know.  It would cause people to vomit if it was in 3D.<br /><br />The CD that comes with it is very good which is why I even gave it two stars.  Hopefully someday an actual cut of the concert that hasn't been butchered will appear somewhere.
B0085A9J18|4.0|It was just like the preview.<br />As all martial arts films are, so was this.<br />Over-the-top violence and very little dialog.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|fun, entertaining free game...whole family can enjoy!  just wish did not advertise other games between solitaire games!great game for helping with motor skills and concentration!!!<br /><br />I upgraded to the deluxe version and love it more!!
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|Love it...great movie.Very entertaining. Channing is really a great actor. A little slow at times, but well worth the time.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|a favorite of the kids, which is the important thing.  Entertaining for adults, too.  Clever dialogue, great graphics and voices.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I knew this movie was not highly rated, but it was a lot worse than I expected.  I was torn between giving it 1 star and 2, but I went with 2 because some of the singing is very good.  The story is just a stupid as can be, though.  Tom Cruise does a good job of singing, although I don't think I saw any evidence of his supposed 5-octave range. There are some other good singers, too, although I didn't think the female lead had a very good voice. Overall a weird movie with a couple of redeeming qualities.
0307454568|5.0|I guess it's different strokes for different folks. I enjoyed the first two books and and was somewhat prepared for disappointment when I read some of the reviews prior to reading \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\". But I enjoyed it just as much as the two previous books. Maybe it's because I enjoyed the procedural way in which the good guys all worked to their own strengths in bringing about a satisfactory conclusion to the entire story. Having finished, and knowing that the Mr. Larsson is no longer of this world, I am left wondering how I can find another book (or series of books) as absorbing and compelling.
0525953728|5.0|I find it impressive that this moving recouning of the events leading to the capture and death of Osama Bin Laden are expressed in stark reality. Owen recounts what is nothing less than a monumental historical triumph that may change the course of human history.<br /><br />Owen's narrative of what took place, and his candid portrayal of the Navy Seals humanizes these exceptional men who face peril and asperity as a way of life. Shared bonds,sacrifice, purpose,and self-discipline define the heroic, sometimes humble, characteristics of a team of extraordinary alpha males.<br /><br />It is easy to understand why the the selection of \\"the best of the best\\" is so exacting.<br /><br />Stunning.
B003JJA59K|5.0|I don't watch many movies anymore.  Someone recommended this one and they were right.  It's a great movie.  It's dark, but has hope.  A believable story in what we could expect after an apocalypse.  Also got to me emotionally, because I related to the father.  Add very good acting, remove all the unnecessary stuff most movies throw in these days, and you have a great, unique movie for someone like me to enjoy.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|i chose this rating because although the book began well and there were some very clever parts integrating the characters with historical events and personalities  i quickly became bored with the manipulations i'm not very interested in politics and i felt this aspect swamped the story and it was too easy to lose the threads linking the charactes to events and to each other it needs a critical stripping down to the essentials then it could be far more entertaining i had some good laughs but after the first encounters with America and atom bombs  it was politics for the sake of rather than for the charactersand their relationships it finally wound down to a rather tired ending for me
B00633W614|5.0|I have read almost all of Pat Conroy's books and this was just as enjoyable as the rest. he tell's a great story and you can't put it down until the last page and then you want more!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked Reflected in You being that I was a tad bit harsh in my review of Bared to You. I do find this book to be a lot better than the first. I start to like Eva and Gideon, where as in the first book they seemed like 2 nut jobs who found each other. Although they do have issues, the 2nd book is a bit more in depth and makes the two characters more understandable. They are still both over the top, but it works for them and the sex scenes are very steamy. I will be reading the 3rd installment of this series to find out all the pieces of the Gideon puzzle! This book left us hanging...
B007THA4FI|5.0|I enjoyed the new work by J.K. Rowling,,A Casual Vacancy. She really knows how to get your attention when telling a story. I have been a fan for many yrs reading the Harry Potter series and this was so different and I enjoyed the characters greatly. Getting to know the people in a small town was amazing.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Very cool movie loved it . Puts a new twist on the old south and pleanty of action in the movie. Yes rent it its good
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My wife just gave me my Kindle fire, &amp; I really didn't think I'd like it. however it has grown on me. to the point I have batt. apps on my cell phones, as they help me keep track of usage, warns me when the batt. is getting too low. This app is a resolute saver. I wish I could have this app for my cell phones. The best part is that it came already installed on the Kindle. Five stars for this app, DEFINATELY!!!
0307454568|3.0|While [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] seems to have been more of a stand-alone book, its two sequels were clearly written as a pair. Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest picks up immediately after the end of [[ASIN:0307949508 The Girl Who Played with Fire]], dealing with the aftermath of the violence in Gosseberga. Lisbeth is in the hospital along with Zalachenko. Blomkvist is, as always, roaming around.<br /><br />I found the approach disappointing. Yes, there was plenty to cover, and many loose ends to tie up, but the middle book ended with sufficient closure that I would have preferred another stand-alone book. This last book in the trilogy was as well written as the second, but it simply was not as good.<br /><br />For one thing, the fiercely independent Salander is in custody, and largely unable to act. I found her to be surprisingly tolerant of the situation, and it didn't quite fit with what we'd know of her until then. But the focus in this book was much more on the other actors - Blomkvist and Berger especially.<br /><br />In Played with Fire, \\"All the Evil\\" turned out to be essentially two connected and horrific events, where I had expected something more and longer lasting. Here, the key mystery also turned out smaller than expected. It could have worked fine, but the build-up was more than the mystery itself.<br /><br />This is a much more procedural book, but worthwhile for its description of the series' key characters. The ending, which ties up a key loose end left dangling throughout the book, is disappointing, and seems like it could have been improved with further editing.<br /><br />All in all, Hornets' Nest is certainly worth reading for any reader of the trilogy, but it's not as effective a book as its predecessor.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this dvd for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! She loves that Tinkerbell has a sister. The movie was well made and the graphics were good. This movie was definitely worth buying for her.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The Pillars of the Earth and World without End are the best books i ever read.  I could not put this book down but i never wanted the story to end.  I actually hugged my kindle when i was done!
B000FC10MU|3.0|I heard so many good things and high hopes, but was left wanting more. The main character never really seems fleshed out. His final resolution is predictable and incomplete. There are a couple supporting characters that scream for more attention as they are only in a few scenes. It's got a good pace and a gritty noir private eye feel to it, none of the humor from Neverwhere, and the numerous references to mostly obscure deities will lead to a lot of Wikipedia reading. It's worth reading, but it is not up to the level it's been ranked in &#34;best of sci-fi&#34; lists I have seen.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Tried pretty much all top rated PDF readers but this comes out on top. The recent addition of ability to contiously annotate ( underline etc) is seen only in this app. This features is so useful when reading text books. Also love the dev support.
B000FC130E|3.0|It's a fun read, and I thought it was more tightly plotted than American Gods. Starts off well, but becomes standard fare at the end. Lots of droll British humor in the vein of Douglas Adams. But not the type of book one would ever read again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It needs to be updated the same time for every device. My best friend has an ipod and got 0.5.0 and it hasn't came out for kindle fire. Other than that this game is amazing.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Awesome game. Makes me wish I would have been a civil engineer. Very simple to play but gets pretty challenging quick. I love bulding things.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this is by far probably the worst app i have ever bought. $5.00 is such a ripoff for this crappy game. Minecraft is a billion times better
B003VIWO9I|5.0|If this book was a boyfriend I would marry it and never ever get divorced. Unfortunately it is a book, so all i can do is read it every few months and enjoy the story again and again.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Love this game!  My kids (9 & 11) have enjoyed the interactive quality of the game by moving the lines to create new paths, and understanding the effect of the angles, bounces, etc.  We also find it educational as it is physics 101!  This reminds us of the \\"Where's my Water!\\"(Disney) game with the alligator.  This can be hours of fun, for me and the kids, trying to get through the different stages.  Great work!

B000I0QM0E|4.0|'Sleepy Hollow' holds a special place in my heart as being the first R-rated film I saw (I was 11 or 12 at the time). Looking back on it almost a decade later it's not as effective as I remembered it to be but it's still a nice blend of Gothic horror and humor.<br /><br />The film is a very loose adaptation of Washington Irving's original story but I feel that it holds true to the spirit of it. Take for example Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane; here he is a skeptical constable as opposed to a superstitious schoolteacher. Still, Depp plays Crane as being effeminate, skittish, and prone to fainting. It's these little touches that make the film more than an adaptation in name only.<br /><br />Storywise, I have to give credit to the screenwriter for actually trying to make an intelligent film as opposed to a period piece slasher. However I feel they made what could have been a good old-fashioned ghost story into an unnecessarily complicated whodunit. I've watched the film three times now and it's still difficult for me to recap how all the puzzle pieces fit in together. This doesn't hurt the film but it could be better.<br /><br />The real star of the film is Tim Burton's directorial style. The film is drenched in style and gives it a real sense of atmosphere; the desaturated colors, the crooked trees, etc. Burton gets a lot of flack nowadays, but I seriously doubt this film would be half as effective under another director's helm.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for Sleepy Hollow was one of the first discs manufactured so it's hard to say if it could look better today. The picture is very grainy, which were likely Burton's intentions and it adds to the atmosphere of the film. I did however notice a couple  of small but noticeable print blemishes throughout the film, which probably weren't. That being said, this title probably isn't a high priority for Paramount so I wouldn't hold my breath for a restored release. There's also a lack of lossless audio, something that's expected for most releases today. It probably won't be a big deal for the average consumer, though.<br /><br />The extras are ported over from the DVD. We get two featurettes that amount to forty minutes in total. There's some interesting behind the scenes stuff here (a bit surprising how much work went into making the Headless Horseman, well, headless). The commentary with Tim Burton is a bit informative if dry; near the end, there are some rather long periods of silence. It's not a bad track but it's not something I see myself revisiting. What I would like to see are some deleted scenes that were clearly shot judging by photos but have never been released.<br /><br />'Sleepy Hollow' is a fun film to watch during the Halloween season.

B004132HZS|5.0|I finally gave in to social media \\"peer pressure\\" and ordered Season one because I kept hearing about how wonderful this show is everywhere I surfed.  I have to say, I was delighted at how well written, and well acted, it is!  Purists, e.g. fans of the Peter Cushing and similar adaptations, may be off-put by this modernized retelling.  Cumberbatch's Sherlock isn't the honorable, brilliant PI assisting the dimwitted police in catching bad guys, assisted by the loyal, albeit somewhat superfluous, Watson. He's still brilliant, but also an arrogant \\"high-functioning sociopath\\" who is motivated to solves crime (in fact, excited by the prospect of a serial killer) because he gets bored easily.  Dr. John Watson becomes his flat mate for financial reasons, and is awed by Holmes' gift if disturbed by his lack of empathy.  As he comes to understand and accept the way Sherlock is, you can see how his character will be a humanizing influence on the great detective.  Cumberbatch is simply mesmerizing in the title role.  Freeman is a solid supporting actor, with a lot of potential to make Watson as compelling as Holmes.  The cases are just beyond credible, but I wouldn't expect Holmes to be solving run of the mill crimes either.  Though secondary characters are not truly fleshed out in the three ninety-minute episodes of the season, the foundation is laid to expand on them. I like that Lestrade is not a fool, and realizes that though Holmes is exasperating and arrogant, his help is often crucial to bring about justice.  The morgue assistant with a crush on Holmes is also likeable, and I hope to see more of her interactions with Sherlock.<br /><br />Though I love the show, I was less than thrilled with the DVD.  This mainly came down to an issue with the sound quality.  After getting half-way through episode one, I had to restart it with subtitles on because the background music/sound is so loud it often muddles the dialog. The is most apparent in the scene in the cab where Holmes is explaining to Watson how he deduced so much about him in their initial meeting. Why does a dialog-heavy scene like this need background music at all?  Though I've been encountering this more often in tv and movies, it is a bigger issue on a show like Sherlock because what he says is so critical to understanding what is going on. And yes, Cumberbatch's accent makes it challenging as well (though normally I have no problems understanding a British accent).  Thankfully, the subtitles on the DVD are excellent and more like closed-captioning. I'm really starting to wish DVDs would come with options like video games do to decrease the sound effects and music, and up the volume on the dialog.<br /><br />Other than this problem, I heartily recommend Sherlock to anyone looking for a fresh approach to the character that is still in keeping with the spirit of Doyle's original creation.is explaining to Watson how he deduced so much about him in their initial meeting.

078322804X|1.0|I ordered this DVD and was excited to receive it as this is one of my favorite movies.  When I received the DVD it didn't play properly.  The scenes jumped around at ten minute intervals.  The audio didn't line up with the video.  I left a negative review.  The seller contacted me and sent a new copy.  I received it only two or three days later.  Just found the other day that this copy does the same thing.  Not pleased at all!!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I am sure that folks who are die hard Alien series fans were wanting a prequel.  Personally, that wasn't something high on my list for movie content, however, this was an interesting walk through. The visuals are excellent but not exceptional.  The story is missing development of the 'master race' of beings which I found to be a nagging disappointment throughout the viewing.  That said, I imagine fans of sci-fi and the Aliens movies will be entertained and find this a worthy couple hours spent.

A good friend with cancer has been after me to consider doing the therapy. He said it would solve my diabetes problems and after two weeks it looks like he is right or at least I'm on the right road. I've lost 14 pounds in two weeks, my blood sugar is now averaging 30-35 points lower and I feel like a new 77 year old.

B009A9BEHU|2.0|As a diehard Coldplay fan, I was super excited when the CD showed up in the mail today, but listening to it, I'm not as impressed.  The recordings are not mixed well at all: they're very muddy (too much bass/drum low end and not enough vocal/piano/guitar), and there is a lot of crowd noise.  Some of the tracks are cut very poorly too, there is an obvious cut between tracks that is far too noticeable and not at all the work of a professional.  I guess it's to be expected from recording in large arenas with huge crowds, but as a professional band I have to say I expected more.  Paradise (the 11th track on the album) was the first track that impressed me, both musically and technically.<br /><br />To sum up:<br />Overall Recording: D+.  Very muddy recordings, poorly cut.<br />Music: B-.  Not the most \\"original\\" of Coldplay's work (it sticks to the album a lot), but still pretty good.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard Coldplay fan, consider buying a few of the tracks (Paradise, Clocks, God Put a Smile, and Yellow are all fairly original or well recorded).  If not, don't waste your money.<br /><br />This all could change when I see the DVD, but I doubt it.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Hit after hit after hit song, with absolutely no filler to be found. Usually greatest hits collections (from any era) include some lesser hits or even some strong album tracks just to help fill out the collection, but not here. On top of that, all these songs are still played around the clock on radio today. Not the type of hits that are forgotten once they leave the charts. Pretty impressive. Obviously, 10 years of making pop music was not wasted on this woman. Plus, there's three new diverse recordings that are top-of-the-line Clarkson. In light of this very impressive collection, I would proclaim Kelly Clarkson the Queen of 21st Century Pop.
B009LY72LQ|2.0|Buyer beware! The packaging may make it look like you will be able to build two complete seperate dolls but in reality you will only be supplied with ONE wig. In other words one of the two dolls will have to be completely bald. My two girls solved this problem (albeit with lots of arguing) with sharing the wig in 15 minute shifts, but really Matell! There is no reason why Matell can't supply a second wig in their packaging so the set would be complete except of course there would be little incentive to buy all those expensive extra add-ons. Other then that somewhat major complaint the dolls are cute (except when one of them is forced to go without hair) and you don't need to buy the Monster High lab in order to build them. The idea is a clever one and allows your children to express their creative side. I just hope eventually someone will get the bright idea of pirating Monster High's doll wigs (their design is not difficult) and sell them online. I'll definitely be a customer. P.S. Look out for missing torsos in other Monster High Create a Doll products!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Finished this book about 1.5 months ago and have yet to find another book as good as it.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|About two minutes into watching Rock of Ages, I realized that it is probably one of the worse movies I have ever seen. It was so bad I began to wonder if the A-list talent in this train wreck ever thought for one minute that their part in this film was possibly one of the biggest mistakes they ever made in their career. For me, I just want that two hours of my life back...
B007MJSYF0|1.0|I read The Hunger Games, then watched the first movie. Loved them all. I set out to watch Battle Royal because I heard it was, essentially, the \\"first\\" Hunger Games. The two bare no similarity aside from young adults killing each other, and I really don't understand the appeal of Battle Royal. It severely lacks the social and political commentary that gives The Hunger Games such a solid foundation, and instead focuses almost exclusively on death, violence, and ludicrous melodrama.<br /><br />The story is nearly non-existent and the reason for having students battle each other to the death is flimsy at best (unemployment too high? Let's just throw a bunch of kids on an island and have them kill each other, that makes sense right?). Most of the characters look similarly to each other and it doesn't help that they all wear the same school uniforms, but no matter, there's nearly 40 of them and most have precious little screen time before some ridiculously gruesome death, so if you get them confused with each other it really doesn't matter much.<br /><br />The whole thing is just completely preposterous, and there isn't even the visceral feeling of survival. One of the characters is just some batsh-t insane kid who carries an uzi and unloads thousands of rounds throughout the course of the movie, and I think I saw him reload his gun once when it was convenient to give one of the characters an opening to attack. It completely loses any sense of realism and feelings for survival when the bullet count is as high as a Schwarzenegger film, despite there being only a handful of guns (seriously, the amount of rounds dispersed he would have to be carrying 2-3 dufflebags filled with nothing but clips of ammo).<br /><br />But perhaps even worse is the melodrama, which is even more copious than the blood splatters. Every single character had to monologue during their death scene about how much they loved such and such student. It just feels so forced and hollow. They couldn't bother to have any characterization prior, so instead they choose to force some half-assed romance during their death scenes to show you how sad it is. But it just comes off feeling awkward and ridiculous.<br /><br />And even worse than that, this small group of students devised a clever plot to escape. Then they get gunned down. That ends that. What was even the point of that side story?<br /><br />The movie also has one of the most absurd deaths I've ever seen. A character gets shot, stands up like it's nothing, sits down on a couch, answers his phone and speaks as if nothing is out of the ordinary, and then dies immediately after that. I was seriously wondering if this was some bizarre attempt at nihilistic humor or something, because if it was meant to have some kind of poignancy it was completely lost with horrendous acting and just awful execution. I haven't felt so awkward watching a movie since the \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" scene in Star Wars Episode III.<br /><br />I couldn't even enjoy this movie in a \\"so good it's bad\\" context, because it actually attempted to have some amount of social and political commentary at the beginning of the movie. It set me up similar to The Hunger Games, but by the end it just felt like a poorly executed slasher flick.<br /><br />Ultimately, Battle Royal is a case of injecting a small amount of artistic integrity into what is otherwise a pure exploitation flick as a flimsy excuse for justifying all the bloodshed and violence.
B00A7OFVVM|1.0|This season isn't very good. It lacks core characters development. The stories seems to have thrown together anything not covered last year like aliens, Nazis, religion, torture, and sterilization with the creepy, gory, sick, violence & sex for the sake of it without a story.<br /><br />Last season, I was drawn to the characters and mysteries. This season there isn't like that.<br /><br />Subtly is out the door like with last year's house maid's changing appearance and story development. Don't expect that this season.

B0028ER4QY|5.0|Somewhere out in a black hole Jim Morrison is laughing all the way to the next star!

B009ERK1T0|5.0|As a long time Deftones fan I can honestly say \\"Koi No Yokan\\" is earning a #1 spot for me in their discography. \\"Saturday Night Wrist\\", \\"Around the Fur\\" & \\"Self Titled\\" are my favorite albums by Deftones but this album has potential to surpass those amazing records. It instantly hooks you in with the track \\"Swerve City\\" and then follows up with the awesome song \\"Romantic Dreams\\" which has a catchy chorus and a melodic groove. \\"Goon Squad\\" also rocks in a way that is playful and energetic bringing light heartedness to a divine sounding record. This album is also probably their most cohesive from start to finish. The transitional pieces between songs are really soothing and help create a nice relaxed mood.<br /><br />As for the members, Stef on guitar is probably the most prominent force on this record. He dominates each song and drills each riff into your skull. Abe on drums is also a major component. He adds so much flair and gives each track sporadic momentum. Chino does his thing with soaring melodies and lyrics that are vague and abstract. He has changed his vocals in some songs by giving them a more guttural elegance. For example check out \\"Entombed\\" and listen to the chorus. His vocals on that song particularly sound more from his gut and makes a strong impact. As for Sergio, he kills it on bass. He plays along Abe but has his moments where he adds a nice texture that sails and diverts to his own rhythm. Lastly but not least, Frank has really grown as a musician giving each track an extra mystique that encourages more listens. He hides in the background but his input is a major ingredient making ethereal ambient noise. All the contributions by the members makes for an inspiring listen that you never want to end and speaking of end, \\"What Happened to You?\\" has to be one of my favorite closing tracks on a Deftones album. It captures the essence of the album in a nice 4 mins span.<br /><br />Once again the Deftones have made an remarkable record. \\"Koi No Yokan\\" will go down as best album of 2012 for many critics and listeners, myself included.<br /><br />(Updated: After seeing these guys live on the Koi No Yokan tour and listening to this album more, \\"Rosemary\\" is one of my top songs from the Deftones.

B007O4XX6S|5.0|How ya doin?  Joe Walsh is 65 years young.  It's been 20 year since he released a solo studio album and the wait was worth it.  He blows the socks off any young guitar players today.  What a talent.  His guitar playing is so good it's easy to overlook his song writing, but that's another unbelievable strength on this album.  From hard rockers to ballads, he tells some very heartwarming, personal stories which makes me love him even more.  If you're a Joe Walsh fan.  Analog Man is a must buy!
0525953728|5.0|When I first heard that \\"Mark Owen\\" had the grits to publish a book despite the warnings for the DoD, I told myself I have to read this book and see what the hype was about. When I read the book I found that it was nothing more than a SEAL telling a story from his perspective, I automatically fell in love with the book, it reads like a buddy of mine is talking to me on base shooting the shit smoking cigarettes in the smoke pit. The account I believe is as accurate as you can get without breaking OpSec. The aspect that struck me the most is that there is no self-hype in the book \\"Owens\\" makes a specific point of telling the reader that this was about him but rather about his team as a true leader should do. If you're not in the armed forces you should read it to get a fraction of the brotherhood we feel with each other, if you are in the armed forces you should read it to rejuvenate that sense of pride we all feel when we sign on the dotted line to do something bigger than ourselves. I would definitely recommend this book to my friend and hope and wish \\"Mark Owen\\" a prosperous and relaxed life, lord know he deserves it.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Steven Spielberg is one of THE notable directors. His movies may not always be perfect but they're all worth watching. This may very well be his best effort.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The Civil War is dragging on into its fourth year. Lincoln wants to both end the war and pass the 13th amendment freeing the slaves. More than one person has told him he cannot do both. Accomplishing one will scuttle the other. He pulls out all stops to prove them wrong.<br /><br />This is a remarkable effort. Whatever great things you've heard about it from paid reviewers are all true. Daniel Day-Lewis is unbelievable. I didn't feel as though I were watching an actor. I felt as though I were watching Lincoln resurrected. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well. James Spader, as W.N. Bilbo is a real hoot. The character was written well and he plays him up in spades. Sally Field, as Mary Todd-Lincoln, is as good as she's ever been. But I cannot single these few out. Everyone did a great job. What I liked most was that this wasn't a biography of the man. It showed him at a specific time, performing a specific task so you got to see him as a man as well as a great politician.<br /><br />The production was top shelf. Costumes, hair styles, sets all transported me back to that time and place. I wasn't watching a movie. I was looking through a time portal. All the top people involved in this film have all worked together with Spielberg in other films but they all reinvented themselves here. This is not like earlier Spielberg films.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this so I might as well stop now. One might have a minor quibble about this or that in the film but it is about as good as a movie can be. So if you are at all disposed toward period dramas this will give you the thrill of a lifetime.

The music will make you think of the usual comparisons - M&S, DMB, etc - while also making you think, hey this Phillip Phillips guy sounds a little different from those other bands. Really enjoyed track 4 - nice mixing, great sweeping vocals, and nice guitar picking. Really hope this kid keeps his head down and avoids the AI machine gimmicks so he can experience the necessary \\"life\\" required to elevate his career to 2nd, 3rd, and more albums. Love that he writes his own music, can't wait to hear more from him so long as he stays true to his ability and perspective. No, he's not the best \\"singer\\" from AI but typically the music that plays the soundtrack to your life is the music with the most passion. If you like this style of music, you can hear Phillip's passion in his writing and his picking. Good job, Phillip!

B007704HO6|5.0|Reading this book is fascinating,  at times it has you  believing it could be a major cartoon movie character. Then your suddenly in the real world, absolutely wonderful. Living in London and seeing BI people everyday; l never will pass by another without at least the generously of  smile and hello. This book has helped me understand my grown children better and not to mention the two cats l own and share my life with.
B000002MY3|5.0|Always was a fan of Alanis, all songs on cd are great, received earlier than expected. A staple for your cd collection
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This was a great film to watch... totally entertaining... as always though the scientists want to save, study and bring an alien species on a ship and go back to earth with it even though it oviously not a good idea with the soldiers sent to protect them from these things in the first place... but I won't spoil the ending for ya... remember it's entertainment...
B008VBYN80|3.0|thelis game is okay.  typical build and defend with decent diversity in tech trees.  development is slow; since every action (collecting taxes; building; planting crops; etc) takes 1 energy ticks.  energy ticks are replaced at 1 every 2-3 minutes.  aside from needing resources such as gold and wood; these energy ticks are needed.  of course more energy can be purchased with diamonds; but diamonds cost real money.  oh well.
030758836X|2.0|I had heard good things about it, but it's not very good, it was only by my sheer determination that I was able to finish it.<br />First of all I don't like it when authors use a lot of cussing. I know there are plenty of people who talk that way, but I try not to spend much time around them, and I certainly don't want to read thousands of 4-letter words.<br />If one of the main characters in the book, Nick is a journalist and made his living with words, he would have a pretty large vocabulary and most likely would speak more than 4-letter words. So I'm guessing that the author talks that way and assumes her readers do as well. Won't read her stuff again. Not worth it. Her characters were shallow and selfish. Ending not believable.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is the book to choose if you would like to dip your toe into the works of Dickens for the first time. It's easy to read with engaging and colourful characters and a classic and timeless moral - mixed with several good doses of humour & social history and an occasional jab at Victorian politics. Timeless.

0307744434|5.0|This book is a wonder. It is as dazzling and full of surprises and magic as the circus it depicts - and this is saying something, as the circus and its various attractions (far too pale a word) is almost another character in its own right such is the loving care with which its sights and experiences are detailed. Yet it is shot all through with strains of pain, joy, longing, hurt, love and loneliness that keep this altogether phantasmagorical tale of a contest without conflict whose true nature is kept hidden painfully long from its participants still very firmly grounded in the reality of our own human condition, with all its frailties and fallibilities. I admit I shied away - too long, to my regret - from reading this book at first because the description offered seemed to highlight the romantic elements of the story - not precisely my usual cup of tea. Take it as a testament, then, that I found the love interwoven through this story as integral and compelling as anything else. Or should it be loves? It is, after all, not truly only one that twists through the narrative, touching and shaping what transpires for the better and the worse both. And in the end, as disaster and tragedy mount around the ravelling edges and fracturing heart of the circus, its enspelled (and enspelling) participants, and those caught on its sidelines or drawn into its enchanting yet dangerous orbit, by their defiance of expectations and imposed or presumed restrictions yield by the barest of margins a bittersweet victory that is genuinely moving and as close to perfect as could reasonably be managed - and far closer than could reasonably be expected. This is a gem of fiction - precious and to be treasured.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|It was like watching a Castle TV episode.  A good recreational read. Still curious to find out who Richard Castle is.
0316187216|5.0|This book is set in the same world as Abercrombie's debut [[ASIN:0575092963 First Law Trilogy]], but like all of his books since then it can be read in a fully satisfying manner as a standalone novel, though those who've been following all the books will also find plenty of through-lines and recurring characters to reward their loyalty - including very prominently a very major one long thought gone (as much as I can say without spoilers, though for long-time readers it will become apparent very soon who I mean). And like Abercrombie's previous work, it is shot all through with savage violence and leavened, if that's the term, with pitch-black humor that punctures human pretensions with an unsparing incisiveness. If you're not familiar with Abercrombie's work, you should know that much as George R.R. Martin has done with epic fantasy, Abercrombie has done with heroic fantasy - drag it down into the muck and the mire of a cold and nasty world where who sets the rules (to the extent there are any) is determined by who has the strength and the will to violence to make it so, not by who has the \\"right\\" to and still less by who has the nobility to set wrong to right. Though I termed this a take on heroic fantasy, don't go expecting many heroes here - if you can find anyone who might not about as readily be termed a villain, they're ahead of the curve. This book also constitutes a bit of a fantasy take on the Western - it's co-dedicated to Clint Eastwood, and if you can't see strains of [[ASIN:B00006FDCJ Unforgiven]] (and rather a number of other Westerns, besides), you either aren't looking or haven't enough familiarity with the genre to spot any parallels or homages. Not to worry in that case though - the book is plenty enjoyable regardless provided you can go along with the blood, gore, and pervasive cynicism only occasionally lightened. A good test is if you've already read the aforementioned George R.R. Martin and enjoyed it, and I can certainly attest it was more than good enough for me.n good enough for me.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have long believed in NDEs, and Dr, Alexander's account of his was captivating. However toward the end when he started talking about the people he has encountered who replicate what he experienced, I started to lose interest. Most of those people are scam artists, although he may have found some legitimate ones. I did have strong doubts about that part of the book, but most of it was scintillating. There's is much we don't know about the \\"other side.\\" I strongly recommend this book. You will not be sorry you read it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and can not say it enough. Thanks for your service to this country. I did serve for 4 years in the Navy, but the service I did would never compete to what you have given. Thank you for your service from the bottom of my heart if you read this. Thanks again. Oh and great book.
0375842209|5.0|This book is beautifully written from start to finish. The characters are vividly painted into your mind, and the tragic background is so bleak but punctuated with sweet, genuine moments that restore your faith in the human spirit. The story is simple, a young girl living in Nazi Germany is delivered to foster parents after her mother can no longer support her. Learning to read and finding books help her endure and see the beauty in the most bleak circumstances. the characters, background and historical context make this book engrossing and affecting through and through. Read this book now!

B009YX02T8|5.0|As a big fan of the Twilight Saga, I have collected each soundtrack and score as the movies have been released.  I usually grab the soundtrack before viewing the movie and then I actually recognize songs as I see it. Usually these soundtracks only have one artist I am familiar with, and the rest are new to me. This is the first that I have recognized at least 4 before listening.  I enjoyed the songs and artists chosen, and after having seen the movie and hearing them along with the appropriate scenes I think most of the songs on this album are perfect. The only exception I have is the song \\"Bittersweet\\" by Ellie Goulding. I do enjoy her music, but for this soundtrack I just didn't see the fit. I did however, think the Green Day song was well chosen. I have been thankful for all the Twilight soundtracks, as they have introduced me to artists I would not normally have given a moment of time to. They have also provided me with a playlist full of enjoyable music, and this album makes a great final addition (along with the score when it becomes available).
B003BKF696|5.0|I've only discovered The National this year... but they are now one of my fave bands. This is my favourite album - with Conversation 16 being my favourite song. Great lyrics, tunes - well produced. This is a hypnotic album that grows on you quickly.... highly recommended.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|The protagonist of the story is completely average and ordinary, with seemingly normal friends and a repetitive life that isn't going anywhere. Then he stops a gun robbery at a bank and receives a card with three messages to deliver. Over the course of the story, he does good things for people, both big and small. He meets wonderful people and even inspired me to be a &#34;secret giver&#34;. However, I wish the Amazon would let me give it 4.5 stars, because although most of the book is extremely well written, the ending is confusing and not spectacular, like I would have expected from Markus Zusak. I recommend it to anyone that enjoyed The Book Thief (one of my all time favorite books) for a clever narration and amazing story.

B0052RDHTM|2.0|Ken Follett's not an elegant writer, but in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" he told a fascinating, fast-paced if sometimes gruesomely tasteless story. \\"Fall of Giants\\" deals with another fascinating historical period, but in spite of a few moderately interesting characters, it never really manages to come to life.<br /><br />Why not? I suspect when one is writing a \\"world turned upside down\\" historical novel, you need a central character and a central point of view to really engage the reader in the surrounding events. \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" though seriously flawed by its endemic racism, works brilliantly as an historical novel because events are all seen through the prism of the author's brilliant creation, Scarlett O'Hara. Of course Scarlett has friends, relatives and servants that enable the author to broaden the perspective, but Margaret Mitchell does not try to give equal time to a northern abolitionist family and an English working class family struggling because the Union's blockade of Confederate cotton shipments has shut down English textile mills. Follett, in his attempt to dramatize the scope of World War I and the upending of ruling class entitlements and imperialist ambitions in several countries, sets up too many people doing too many things to deal with too many issues in too many places. The story moves among five intertwined families--Welsh miners, English aristocrats, German diplomats, Russian revolutionaries and American industrialists--shifting from domestic scenes to organizers' meetings to halls of power to battlefields--and in addition to everything else, throws the changing role of women into the mix. As a result, you never engage with any one character or set of circumstances long enough to care.<br /><br />\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" works in spite of its wide scope and large cast of characters because it focuses on a single community and a power struggle between two central characters with whom the rest of the characters have logical links. While I giveFollett credit for handling all the characters and plots in \\"Fall of Giants\\" without confusing the reader, it's like trying to stuff bites of five different foods in your mouth at once. You can hardly chew, and there's no distinctive flavor to savor or remember.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|The Avengers is unlike most of the movies out there today. Most of today's superhero movies involve one hero against one villain or sometimes more than two villains. But in the Avengers, there is a collective amount of superheroes ranging from the Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and The Black Widow while the one main villain is Thor's brother, Loki. The clash of all these characters and fight scenes they all pull off play a large role into making this a great movie to watch. All of the fight scenes in the movie leave you hanging in suspense like when Iron Man returns a nuclear bomb to space before it hit the city. The movie also adds some humor to it especially the part where Loki is tossed like a rag doll by the Hulk after doubting the Hulk would do anything to him. There were only two small issues I found with the movie. One is not enough expansions of the character's background or history. It feels like you already are supposed to know who they are and what happened to them before. This leads to my next point, if you haven't seen the preceding movies like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, or the Hulk, it won't make much sense in terms of plot. But overall I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes a lot of action, fighting and that wants to be left on the edge of their seats.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I played for about a month.  Put up with it freezing my kindle fire.  I had made it to level 36.  the tasks were fun.  then this morning I opened it and it had started completely over!  So I'm done!  It was fun but now I'm done.  I'm not even going to try to mess with it anymore.  it takes up all tons of my app memory space.  it doesn't always work right.  it was hit or miss if I could visitmy friends to get hearts....I'm done.  that is rediculous!
030746363X|4.0|I learned a lot of things from reading this book, but I bought it to lose weight. The low carb diet in the book works. I lost 21 pounds in 2 1/2 months and kept it off for 6 months. The only thing I think is the problem is when you don't have time to make meals or you wake up too early in the morning to eat 30 grams of protein with in a hour of waking up. After 6 months of doing this diet I got a new job that was very demanding and I found it difficult to maintain. If you don't have  a crazy schedule and you have time to make meals this is a wonderful book. The science behind all the subject matter in this book was very interesting.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This has all the markers of a super hero movie - the hero himself, his messed up family life, the evil villain, the girl for whom our hero pines, the end of the world. But those satisfying components aside, I loved this movie for the incredible scenery and effects. The world of the gods was so magnificent and spectacular that I was able to get completely lost in it. Meanwhile back on Earth... things were not looking so good. After everyone is rescued, the hero has learned his lesson, the villain is at bay (or so we are lead to believe), and the girl is now pining for the beautiful god.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. He strikes the right balance between rebellious, self-possessed golden boy and hot lover who saves the world.<br />Natalie Portman plays the science geek who is oblivious to her own sexiness - until Thor sort of wakes her up. She is a bit less believable in this role. The chemistry between Thor and Jane Foster is a bit meh.<br />Tom Hiddleston as Loki brings the evil-slash-tortured character to life. Never loved, always second... we feel sorry for him, and then we don't, and then we do. Well played, Loki.<br /><br />Overall, incredibly entertaining. A must watch if you want to enjoy The Avengers!

B000022TSY|3.0|Iconic, but dull as ditch water. With actors hired on location, jump cuts, improvisation, tripping camera guys, rock soundtrack, this is a pothead's tribute to Godard, Kerouac, and those who pursued,and missed, the American Dream.  Captain America and Billy don't represent freedom so much as the alternative culture's imitation of Big Time Capitalism.  \\"We blew it,\\" Captain America says. Evidently, lots of cultures \\"blow it\\" in this film:  The Anasazis, farmers--the film is littered with the wreckage of lost cultures.  The commune where the guys grab lunch shows the perils of self-absorption.  Clearly, the living-off-the land thing ain't easy even if Captain America admires it.  There's lots of eco-porn here.  The camera gives us too many panoramic shots of purple mountains' majesty.  Woodstock is over; the Age of Aquarius offered little but grass-fueled talk about Porky Pig. Billy and CA, like Butch and Sundance, are relics of an age gone by. Not so much an age but an over-exposed blip on the screen.  The idealism of trust-fund hippies hasn't worked out. On to the 70s!  Fleetwood Mac, double-knit suits, disco and the Ford Pinto!  Mostly ER is a film about film-making; this doesn't make for edge-of-the-seat viewing though. Borrow your buddy's copy.

B009AMANH4|5.0|What a movie!<br /><br />I saw this movie on a special viewing before it came out officially! The theater was packed! They took all cell phones from everybody (what a treat...) and everybody was really quiet and followed the movie. This is the way to enjoy a movie in a movie theater. I wish they will do this for all movies and all viewings.<br /><br />What a performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. This is the real Lincoln. The compassionate Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Sally Field is outstanding and Tommy Lee Jones has probably given all he had to this movie. I understand why Daniel Day Lewis makes movies only every two-three years. I assume he needs to get out (mentally) of the character he just played. The intensity of his performance is equal to the one in \\"There Will be Blood\\". He will definitely win the Oscar this year. I don't see anybody competing with him.<br /><br />This is not an action movie. If you expect action, fighting, blood and intense thriller-like moments, forget it. Move on to the next movie. This film is about pure performance and great acting. This is about great dialogues and great historic drama. This is about the dream of a great man to abolish slavery. He proposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in spite of the opposition. He stood by it like a big man. He won the votes of some members of the Democrat Party by doing whatever it takes, because he knew he was right. Didn't care about his public image or the next election. He realized that he needed to save the Republic. He compromised because he needed to save the country. He new that abolition was the first step. Other leaders in the future would get the rest. Where are these kind of leaders today? We missed you Mr. Lincoln.<br /><br />Beside the major plot of the movie, the smaller secondary plot that involves Lincoln and his son is interesting and really puts things in perspective. Even a president like Lincoln will use his privileges to keep his son out of the war.<br /><br />Five stars all around for everything, including the great direction by Spielberg.the war.<br /><br />Five stars all around for everything, including the great direction by Spielberg.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|One reason we have never let our kids watch The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition), is because of how disrespectful Ariel is. The whole story is based on her disobedience and disrespect for her father. Not to mention Disney isn't known for having strong, good mother figures (most mothers are evil or non-existent).<br /><br />So as we are sitting watching Brave, my wife keeps looking at me with that look of, &#34;There is no way our kids are going to watch this movie and not think its okay to disrespect your folks. In addition, it will probably happen in the end that the disrespect will get overlooked in light of some greater threat.&#34;<br /><br />But we stuck through it and have to say we really, really liked the story in the end.<br /><br />The animation was top-notch for sure, no questions Pixar would do anything less than excellent.<br /><br />The humor is throughout and entertaining.<br /><br />The movie finished about twenty minutes ago and there is no blood in the movie. . .from what I can remember.<br /><br />The violence against others is in Three Stooges humor, defending one's self, or chasing something evil.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />Even when the heroine realizes a witch is involved, she doesn't hesitate to ask the witch for help. Doesn't this communicate that it's okay to seek power from &#34;evil&#34; sources is okay? The characters even make fun early on that the dad doesn't believe in magic and how silly he is for such things. I could just imagine some teens standing up in the theaters shouting, &#34;Wiccas Unite!!&#34;<br /><br />OVERALL: A good story that has more potential and is set up for a sequel.<br />It's worth the watch and the 3-disc Blu Ray / DVD set is less than $10 this coming Black Friday sale at Walmart or Best Buy. . .not sure about Amazon's sales price yet.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|WHY these people review something they have not seen is beyond me, but no use wasting time trying to figure it out.<br /><br />I, however, HAVE seen the movie, finished it about 10 minutes ago. I saw it with my 15 year old daughter and my husband, all of us with different tastes in movies and all of us in love with this film. We all loved the first two, with differing favorites, but this one is quite unique.<br /><br />I am not the kind that reviews a plot, you can find that on [...], I think a review should be the writer's opinion of what they saw, not a synopsis.<br /><br />The first MIB was a new, unique type of film, with original characters and excellent chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones...who'da thunk it?<br /><br /> It was a huge success for many reasons and therefore made a lot of money, so they made MIBII. This movie was good as well, more of the same, for those of us who didn't get enough of the first film.<br /><br />So frankly, when MIBIII was announced I was a bit Leary, thinking \\"how can they do this again without it being stale\\"? Well let me tell you they not only gave us the duo we love, but even better versions of them and of the franchise (Both young and old \\"K\\", young \\"K\\" being an almost miraculous performance by Josh Brolin). We have a plot that is worthy of the MIB series, but with a twist at the end that is breathtaking and highly emotional, something you would not expect from an MIB movie. This, to me, elevated the entire series a few notches. Another pleasant surprise was the humor, which is more prevalent, relevant, and intelligent. It felt like each actor was giving his/her best in this film, not that the others were bad, but there is very little \\"camp\\" in this film, yet the irreverence and humor are still there.<br /><br />My family, of 3 conflicting tastes, sat staring at a 17 inch computer screen for an entire movie and were enthralled, and afterwards all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time.<br /><br />Buy this movie, DVD, Blu-Ray, or amazon on demand, it doesn't matter but you need to own this film. It is fun, fast paced, funny and poignant. Wish I had more than 5 stars to give it.esn't matter but you need to own this film. It is fun, fast paced, funny and poignant.

B0018OFN4U|4.0|This movie is witty and devious.  It is a typical zombie movie with blood and guts but mostly it is a satire on modern life.
B001EN71CW|5.0|After hearing the reviews of this show(which I've never seen but definitely heard great things about), it reminds me of a certain show I love. It's not live action, it is actually an anime, straight from Japan. It's title is \\"Cowboy Bebop,\\" though the people who watch \\"Firefly\\" and the people who watch anime aren't really alike, the genre, style, plot and \\"grittiness\\" of an advanced, yet not very flashy future are almost exactly the same. Like \\"Firefly\\" the characters are all very individualistic and all have a future they are aiming for, separate from the future of any one character aboard the \\"Bebop\\"(their ship).<br /><br />Quote from the plot summary from wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"The 26-episode series revolves around the often violent adventures undertaken by the arguably mismatched crew of the BeBop spaceship. The crew is made up of four unique characters: Jet Black, a former ISSP police officer who retired following a mob hit that cost him his arm, Spike Spiegel, a laid-back exiled hitman of the ruthless Red Dragons' Syndicate, Faye Valentine, a beautiful amnesiac con artist who awakened into the future world after a lengthy period of cryogenic hibernation, and Radical Edward, a hyperactive and barefooted preteen girl with a reputation as a prolific computer hacker. They are also accompanied by Ein, a hyper-intelligent, genetically-engineered stray Corgi dog.<br />By a strange twist of their respective fates, this foursome ends up partnering together, using their unique talents to become a ragtag team of bounty hunters, although their fortunes as such are at best mixed.\\"<br /><br />Sounds very familiar.<br /><br />If you are a fan of \\"Firefly\\" I recommend watching \\"Cowboy Bebop\\" it's a great anime, and don't be drawn away from it just because it is animated. The mixture of humor, drama and action is amazingly well constructed and once you start watching it, you will end up watching the entire 26 episodes, it's that good. Also it was made 4 years BEFORE \\"Firefly\\"so if you think Bebop stole the idea because of it's very similar qualities, it is the other way around.<br /><br />(If you do decide to watch it, I strongly recommend the Japanese version with English subtitles, Japanese voice actors are infinitely better than English voice actors, but if you are turned off by having to read what is going on, the English dub is not so bad either)<br /><br />Have fun watching either of these shows, I'm sure you'll have a great time!<br />Link: [[ASIN:B00102FF7U Cowboy Bebop Remix: The Complete Collection (Anime Legends)]]

B005LAIHZY|5.0|This production is so brilliant in conception and execution that it seems almost petty to quibble with any aspect of it. But the problem with any work of art that's nearly but not quite perfect is that the imperfection stands in relief.<br /><br />There is a definite disconnection between the words mouthed by the human actors and the mouth movements of the animated figures. At times it's almost as if sound is not quite synchronized to picture, but with this Blu-Ray recording, the synchronization is of course exact. Or, it's as if (almost) the picture has been dubbed into a foreign language. This is especially true where the faces, like that of the heroine, are greatly simplified, rounded, smoothed and stylized. With grotesque faces, such as that of the witch, where extreme facial distortions are employed by the animators, the lip-syncing is perfectly convincing. A fuller range of facial muscles appear to be forming the words, and the result is presented as far more convincingly human.<br /><br />It's a small quibble indeed. I had not seen any animated film in years; they just never drew me in. They all were so childish, and none captured my attention. This one draws me in completely, and as someone who is sixty-eight, my tastes have become jaded.<br /><br />See this one in Blu-Ray. It really is worth all of twenty-five bucks.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Where the first book seemed a lot like 50shades, this book was vastly different. I love Gideon and his dark and dangerous ways. This book was a quick read because I couldn't put it down!
B0083D9MXM|5.0|Couldn't be more pleased.  CDs arrived quickly and intact (even the US postal service<br />did not succeed in damaging them).  The seller is in England, but the parcel<br />was mailed from Belgium, and the postage was still less than US domestic rates.<br />The performances are amazing examples of the 90-plus year old Stokowski's skill<br />and wizardry, and of his ability to make a piece of music come alive, from<br />Brahms to Ives.  We will never hear his like again.  The National Philharmonic,<br />the orchestra Charles Gerhardt formed for recording, is superb.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Read many of his books and after the first four the quality went downhill.  This one kept me reading.  The twists and turns were creative.  It's great to see the quality of his first books come back.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is a book about running and about diets just like the title says. If you read Born to Run and liked it you'll like this too. Not much in the way of direct practical advice (other than the recipes at the end of each chapter), but a great read for those who love autobiographies, and plenty of running inspiration. Though Jurek talks a lot about veganism and his philosophy of life, I felt like he took a reasonable approach and didn't try to shove it down your throat; he takes more of a \\"this worked for me, and could for you too\\" angle. I was recovering from runner's knee after my first half marathon when I picked this up and it gave me an extra push to get back on the trails once my knee was back in shape.

0061122416|2.0|I have seen this book on many store shelves for years, and finally picked up a copy.  What a disappointing read.  I looked at the date of publication, late 80's. I think that the book probably fit in well during that time approaching a new milennium, when new age/spiritaul/mystical books like the Celestine Prophecy engaged so many of us, including me.  I am a very spiritual individual.  Reading the Alchmist in 2012, however, I found the message itself deep but the delivery very superficial.  The verbiage in particular was very superficial...lots of reference to the \\"Soul of the World\\", the \\"Language of the World\\", the \\"Elixir of Life\\", the \\"Master Work\\"...and a glossing over of the explanations of what these things REALLY mean.  It reminded me of looking up a word like \\"fabulous\\" in the dictionary, being directed to look up \\"terrific\\", and when you look up \\"terrific\\" it directs you back to \\"fabulous\\".  You get the overall jist of what they are all about, but you feel unfulfilled.  So that's how I felt with this book...it was relatively enjoyable but much too superficial.  I would not be interested in reading any other books by this author.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Nothing wrong with this! Easy, fast download and great music! I love Taylor Swift and this album doesn't disappoint.I'd highly recommend it.
B007IL5D3S|5.0|As per usual,Vince Flynn delivers another great Mitch Rapp thriller.I must admit ,I thought he eased away from the usual Rapp all action,kick the hell out of or kill the  bad guys,and seemed more about Irene Kennedy ,but as the story began to unfold,back came the old Mitch Rapp . Absolutely Brilliant!!!
1442419814|5.0|My expectations for this book were high, and I was not disappointed. From the time I picked this book up, I could not put it down. I rushed through it and was disappointed I hadn't picked up the second as well.<br /><br />Scott Westerfeld tells the tale of Tally, an ugly that wants to be pretty. She has wanted to be pretty for so long, and see's nothing wrong with it. The life of a pretty is easy. There is nothing to worry about except what parties your invited to. Who wouldn't want that? Her operation is approaching fast, and soon she will get her dream granted. Then, she meets Shay, and she suddenly she doesn't know what to think anymore.<br />The plot takes you for loops and whirls, and there is never a slow moment.<br /><br />The characters are all interesting, even Peris- her friend who is a pretty. Actually, I liked him a lot. He wasn't in the book much, or even very important, but still. Through out the whole book, there were some funny moments and some heartfelt moments. Everything moved very quickly. Most books drag out the \\"chase\\" but not this one! It was actually refreshing. There's not much to say about the writing style. It is very simple and nothing special, but still it's captivating.There is so much content contained within the 400 pages, it ridiculous.<br />And that ending! It was having me hit myself.
1451638450|5.0|I think this is the first book since Memory that I truly enjoyed. Bujold is a great author and I love Miles saga.
0061726834|4.0|I picked up this book not really knowing what to think. The back of the book didn't help. All of the swirly letters and lovey-dovey stuff made me worry that the book would be cheesy. Yet, with all the hype and the dsytopian thing going for it, I couldn't resist.<br /><br />The plot was fun. I liked how it slowly built up from slow to fast. Lena's conflicting emotions are spot on. The one thing I didn't like was how she seemed too excepting to Alex, but I guess that it would be difficult not be curious about something you've never known.<br />Then, there is Alex. Alex is a perfect guy. Maybe too perfect. I think that he could have used a flaw or two.<br />Lauren Oliver has a way of balancing her descriptions of the world with story. I like that. I hate reading a book that has little detail. Details are important.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Delirium! It left something to ponder. I would definitely recommend this book, but not to everyone.
B005LAII9O|2.0|The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the print was beautiful.  The beach scenes show up so clear on my LED TV it was almost 3D.<br /><br />Salma Hayek's character seemed to be based off of the woman in the documentary \\"Cocaine Cowboys\\" and that woman was like a black widow spider and a shark rolled up in one deadly package.<br /><br />The characters in the movie were SAVAGES and they would have killed the threesome the moment Ben and Chon rejected their offer and attempted to run.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro's performance was excellent.  In fact without him, Salma Hayek, John Travolta the movie would have been a total waste of time.<br /><br />Regardless of what happened to \\"O\\"  how did that airhead become a ruthless killer when Ben tossed his cookies when they robbed the cartel?<br /><br />The movie would have made better sense if O was a wife or the cartel kidnapped a child but even the O admitted she was a slut.  Go figure.<br /><br />Glad that I didn't waste my money at the movies.
006197806X|4.0|I expected great things from this book, great thing indeed. Was I satisfied? To an extent. The potential to make a great trilogy is within Oliver's reach. Hopefully, and I have a great amount of hope and clarity, she won't mess it up.<br /><br />The story starts off where Delirium left off, with a slight time skip. Lena is now on the outside, in the Wilds, and it's a harder life than she thought it would be. She struggles at first, but gains her footing in no time. She has trouble copping with her memories of Alex and Hana and her old life.<br /><br />Lena is our main character. She is the one that faces struggles head on. In Delirium, I have to admit, I thought she was a bit lackluster. But in Pandemonium, I was so happy with her. She did things that I liked, things that made me proud of her. She changes in realistic ways and grows. In the first book, it seemed a bit unrealistic that Lena could change so drastically, morphing into something that she is not. This book changes that around, taking what she turned into and making her grow more slowly. For this, I applaud Oliver.<br /><br />Julian is another major character. Let me just say that I absolutely love him! I like him more than Alex. Where as Alex is a perfect guy, I think that he feels flat when compared to Julian. Julian has his own pros, but he also has cons, and that's what I love about him. He is naive and sheltered, as most are in their society, but also curious.<br /><br />The plot takes many twists and turns throughout the story. As I read, I gasped and grumbled. There was so much going on, but I'm not complaining. Though, I am complaining about one thing: the structure of the book. Pandemonium is broken up into alternating \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" sections. I absolutely loved the \\"Now\\" parts! It's just the \\"Then\\" moments that I have issues with. The flow of the book is jerky because of this. At times, I felt like just skipping the \\"Then\\" sections. I mean, you go from and action scene to a dull scene about them trekking through the woods. It really ruined the moment for me.<br /><br />Besides that, I can't complain. The book really delivered for me, yet still left me hanging. The ending was obvious, but I didn't care, as it was a good set up for the next book. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Dystopian books. The series is fantastic, and though it has it flaws, it is still a satisfying read.

0439023491|3.0|After I read the first book of the Hunger Games trilogy, I was left wanting more. I took a few weeks off from reading to digest the amazing storyline that the Hunger Games presented to me. I finally saw it fit to start reading the second novel in the trilogy Catching Fire. I have to admit the book started fairly slow for me. All the action that occurred in the first book just in the first chapter, is missing from this second installment. The story really started getting hot around chapter 9 or so. From there I was pretty much hooked and the end was a fiery bang. I really didn't want it to end. I need to read MockingJay now

B005FITIK0|4.0|I have to wonder about the one and two star reviews. Some of them seem to be merely because the viewers were expecting a typical romcom or other \\"lite\\" romp, but with the exception of misleading trailers, I don't think the movie should be blamed for that. There are, indeed, cringe-worthy scenes in this film, but there are also laugh-out-loud moments. But what I really enjoyed was that there was no moralizing - the viewer is free to take away from the experience what they will. Mavis is not a terribly sympathetic character, but neither is she always wrong. When she attacks Patton Oswalt's character for letting his past define his life, she's being hypocritical in the extreme, but also perceptive. Her belief that suburban, married life can be a prison sentence is not entirely unjustified, either. But the real issue at hand is that her high school sweetheart has actively participated in his life, making choices that suit him, while she has been swept along, helpless. Mavis has a life - she just can't recognize it as such because it's happened TO her rather than being created BY her. And for a lot of us, that probably hits too close to home. Even when you think you're the one making the decisions, it's not uncommon to wake up in your late-30's, early 40's and say, \\"How the heck did I end up here?\\" To me, this movie is really about one woman's ruthless determination to avoid the introspection required to answer that question, and her lack of motivation to do anything about it.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|Hey!  What happened?!  I am accustomed to a fine read from Mr. DeMille so I was most disappointed when I delved into this book.  The story seemed secondary to the greater theme of how terrible the CIA is (as apposed to the FBI and other law enforcement organizations).  Mr. Corey is his usual wise-cracking self but the other characters just did not come to life, especially his wife, Kate.  Here I was, expecting a good romp when, in fact, the story dragged on and on - endlessly and in my opinion, unnecessarily reviling the Yemeni people.  Hmm - so, what happened?
B009E3EYS8|5.0|The 1970s have at times been derided as a lost decade in music. Despite the rise of disco and punk and some truly dreadful pop, however, giants walked the earth in those days: the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and The Who, the holy trinity of British rock. They were huge, but with the death of The Who's Keith Moon in 1978 and the tragedy in Cincinnati in 1979, the loss of John Bonham and the disbanding of Led Zeppelin in 1980, and the release of the last number-one Stones album in 1981, these giants faded away. Yes, the bands or their members continued to record and tour, but it wasn't the same.<br /><br />In the mid-2000s, however, there came a revival of sorts. The Stones and The Who released their last studio albums in 2005 and 2006, but most significantly, Led Zeppelin reunited in 2007 for their final concert at London's O2 Stadium. They had made brief, abortive, and poorly received attempts at reunions in the 80s and 90s, yet this show was worthy in all respects. Millions tried and failed to buy tickets for the one-time-only event, while critics raved. The band proved cohesive and dynamic: Robert Plant was in fine, powerful voice, Jimmy Page played his guitars with precision and passion, John Paul Jones' bass and keyboards helped give the music its stomp, and Jason Bonham ably filled his father's shoes on drums and percussion.<br /><br />The show paid tribute to the late great Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records and champion of many legends, from Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin to the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. Ertegun died, ironically, of a backstage fall at the 2006 concert that became \\"Shine a Light,\\" Martin Scorsese's excellent Rolling Stones documentary.<br /><br />At last \\"Celebration Day\\" is being released on both audio and video discs. The thunderous sound is clear and vibrant, the cinematography crisp and tightly focused on band members (though the editing is annoyingly rapid). Recordings are available in no less than nine different formats, but whichever one you buy, I wholeheartedly recommend you choose an edition that includes a DVD or Blu-Ray, as the visual experience of the concert is a must. You really need to see the intensity and camaraderie that the group manifests, the intimate pleasure they take in working together again after so many years. You can pass on the rehearsal disc, which pales by comparison.<br /><br />The impeccably chosen set list, running just over two hours, is full of blues-inspired classics, and Plant credits the original bluesmen whose songs they nicked: Robert Johnson for \\"Terraplane Blues,\\" used in \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" and Blind Willie Johnson for \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine.\\" The show opens with definitive renditions of \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" from the first album (\\"Dazed and Confused\\" gets more than 11 minutes later on), \\"Ramble On\\" from the second album (a fantastic version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is the penultimate number), and \\"Black Dog,\\" one of four essential tunes from the fourth album (including \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll,\\" which closes the concert with a roar).<br /><br />From the sixth album, \\"Physical Graffiti,\\" comes another extended song, the 11-minute, gospel-themed \\"In My Time of Dying\\" (as well as \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and a positively epic \\"Kashmir\\"), and from the seventh album, \\"Presence,\\" comes \\"For Your Life\\" in its first and only live performance (plus \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\"). \\"No Quarter\\" and an energetic \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" are taken from the fifth album, \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" while \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is the sole song from the third album.<br /><br />Although this show can't quite match Led Zeppelin's peak performances of the 70s, and though it can't include every important song (I would have loved to hear a bit more from the early albums, like \\"Communication Breakdown,\\" \\"Living Loving Maid,\\" and \\"Immigrant Song\\"), it is nonetheless a joyful triumph and an impressive monument to the enduring greatness of the band and their music.

0375842209|5.0|Opening In the midst of Nazi Germany at the inception of World War II, The Book Thief is a heartrendingly beautiful tale of one girl's struggle against the caprice of the fates. We meet Liesel Meminger as an eight year old girl on the way to her new foster home, and this theme of human displacement runs throughout the novel, as indeed it did throughout the war.<br /><br />At the heart of it all is Death, the books unexpectedly warm and darkly humorous narrator. Zusack somehow manages to make us love and loathe Death in equal measure, as the teller of Liesel's story is as poignant as he is poetic. He guides us expertly across both time and space as he oscillates between Liesel's individual story and the broader tragic chain of events that made up the Second World War.<br /><br />Zusack masterfully humanizes a brutal period of history that is often thought about merely in figures, and he does this primarily through the characterization of the town of Molching, and in particular the ironically named Himmel Street. The `heaven' that the street name purports most certainly does not seem apt given the harsh reality that surrounds the lives of its inhabitants, but our narrator provides us with numerous glimpses of the hidden beauty that lies within.<br /><br />Liesel's foster father, Hans Hubermann, is a character who will live long in the memory. Characterized not only by the accordion he so expertly plays and the cigarettes he so frequently smokes, `Papa's' blossoming relationship with Liesel has a purity and a uniqueness to it that is quite overwhelming. Even the more outwardly brash characters ( see Liesel's foul mouthed mother Rosa and her borderline insane best friend Rudy) each exhibit moments of genuine kindness and humanity that restores the readers(and Deaths) faith in mankind. The author leaves no stone unturned in Himmel Street through the various characters he paints, and by the time bombs begin to rain down on Molching, we feel as if they are raining down onus.<br /><br />What this novel is really about though, are words, and the power they have for good, and indeed for ill. Liesel's life is punctuated and characterized by numerous acts of book thievery, and these books ultimately bring her into closer contact with Max Vanderburg, the Jew her family is hiding in the basement. These words they share deepen the tenderly developed bond they hold, and they each become determined in their own unique way to use their common enemy's (The Fuhrer's) words against him.<br /><br />This book is an absolute must read for anyone who still dares to believe in the resilience and empathy of the human race, as well as for anyone who doubts just how life changing a book can be.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie is action packed all the way through!  It's fun for everyone, with some educational elements, and lots of beautiful scenery. Great vivid color and (A+) level CG Animation. Great hard hitting action, and sound effects on Blue Ray! It's a great unique storyline. There are NO dry areas in this movie. It's put together very well. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thank you.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|It doesn't work with the kindle fire unless you have several other apps so it will work with them.  I don't use the other apps. So it is useless for me. It would probably work fine if you had the other apps.
0618001905|5.0|This book and Michela Wong's \\"In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz\\" is required reading for anyone with an inkling of curosity as to why the DRC is in the shape it's in today. It was recommended to me by the AF Desk Officer at the State Department prior to my assignment to Kinshasa in the fall of 2007. I picked it up on a Saturday afternoon and by the following Friday I finished it and then went back and reread several of the chapters, and subsequently reread the entire book half-way through my tour in 2008. I considered it my good fortune to have served in the Congo, and this book more than any other helped me to understand that throughout it's history, with the brutality visited upon it by King Leopold and all the things that subsequently happened with Mobutu; the Congo, the Congolese, never had a chance.
B005LAII12|4.0|This is the first motion picture outing by Seth MacFarland, the creator of the animation TV series \\"The Family Guy\\".<br />With the exception of a few hiccups at the start of the film, it is a laugh-out-loud movie from start to finish, a rare<br />case nowadays for American comedy films.<br />Credits must be given to Seth MacFarland for making a very funny movie based on an old premise:  A lonely child grew<br />attached to his toy teddy, in this case it became his life long companion.<br />The always good Mark Wahlberg was engagingly supported by Mila Kunis and a team of able supporting actors.<br />The film was filmed in a darker pallet than most romantic comedies from the US, but with a soundtrack music from the<br />50's which gave the film an extra dose of style and personality.<br />At the end, it is the ted of Seth MacFarland.<br />One of the funniest comedy film from the US in recent years, if you don't mind some of the outrageous antics and expletives.
1419705849|4.0|My kids 11 and 13 love these books. They read them one after the other. These and the How to Train your Dragon Series. So if you want to encourage reading and see the kids get real enjoyment from it, then get them this series of books. They are character driven, well paced and funny.<br />Enjoy
B0049WHNLO|4.0|I used to have this on vinyl. It's a great, energetic, and spectacular live performance by the Duke and his band. Their performance ranks up there with the Duke's 70th Birthday Concert, and Gonsalves' solo is, as they say, worth the price of admission alone.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I had a hard time putting it down and stayed up too late a few nights trying to finish it.
145162607X|1.0|I was disappointed. My major concerns were probably ideological - I am a partisan for Richard III, and he is portrayed in the book as manipulative. Perhaps this is in keeping with the perspective adopted when the author chose as her subject the Earl of Warwick's daughter - who probably could be assumed to take the Earl's side in the conflicts of the period.<br />More serious is that most of the book portrays Anne Neville as convinced that Queen Elizabeth is attacking her family using witchcraft - yet at the end, this perception is apparently undermined completely.  This felt like a \\"bait and switch\\".  The reader is left hanging - not knowing whether the premise of most of the book has been to reflect a 15th Century superstitousness that we cannot accept.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's music is phenomenal and and refreshing.  I have followed her music on Youtube for years and was very excited for the release of her CD.  The CD contains only her own compositions.  Some regret the loss of some of her cover music, but I think it was a good idea.  This avoids the cost of royalties on her part and pushes Lindsey Stirling as her own artist.  I think it lets you enjoy her work and you are not distracted by the fact that it is a different version of a song you already know.  (Not to knock her covers I like most of them better then the originals.)  As far as the songs on the CD itself, all of them are great.  I cannot choose a favorite and there are no weak songs.  \\"Zi-Zi's Journey\\" and \\"Stars Align\\" stand out on the top, particularly of the new tracks.  \\"Crystallize,\\" \\"Moon Trance,\\" \\"Transcendence\\" ...eh all of them are brilliant.  The unusual mix of music styles makes it all the better and gives a freshness to music.  It is well worth the cost of the CD and deserves to be played loud.  On a side note if you get a chance to see her in concert, do it.  Her live performance is a real treat and beyond words.  I was expecting a great show and what we got was something even better.  I love seeing how she grown as an artist and to be able to support her work.
B0076794IO|3.0|Certainly not groundbreaking, but a decent read and believable characters. I enjoyed it and worth downloading. Just not as good as the reviews.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|If you are expecting a movie based on the board game Battleship to be \\"good\\", then I wouldn't buy this movie. It's not very good as far as critics go... I am not a critic, I wanted a movie with things blowing up in HD with sweet surround sound, and Battleship definitely delivers. If you are looking for a \\"guys flick\\" this is a great one!

B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This film is funny and poignant.  It almost feels like Wes Anderson wrote himself into the story.  Find your inner child and celebrate along with the main characters as they seek their slice of freedom.  Well written, well acted and well directed.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I would suggest if your thinking of buying this book, find something else to read. Hate to say because I am a big DeMille fan but the Panther was not worth the time or the money. Very slow with almost zero action and John Corey's humor has hit a wall.

B00006FDCD|2.0|This movie scared me outta my mind when i was young.... Now it just put me to sleep. I read the book (which was also long and boring) then watched the movie. Maybe its poor acting or the poor special effects, either way, i was not impressed. I always saw myself as a Steven King fan, but the more I read of his stuff, im finding that im not. I do love the Shining but thats about it.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I own 3 different versions of Jane Eyre, and this is by far my favorite. It's the longest and most complete version, and I believe the characters are the best representation of what I pictured from the book. I think this Jane's personality is an excellent mix of quiet and self respect and a little bit of humor that play out really well, and this Mr. Rochester is moody and self-centered but somehow still lovable, like he should be. I think the ending was a very nice interpretation of what was hinted in the book. Some of the edits (like how Mr. Rochester was not disguised as a gypsy but hired one) were appropriate. I would have liked a little more about her childhood and her relationship with Helen but the movie is already something like 4 hours so I see why that was left out.<br /><br />Some may not like the scenes where Jane recalls her and Mr. Rochester's 'discussions' directly after the failed wedding (he tries some seduction to get her to stay) - I think it shows that they're both human, and feel strongly for each other on multiple levels - ultimately she overcomes her desires and leaves, and from this you can see how really hard this was for her. It's a little stronger than the scenes implied in the book but I think it works well.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'll always be amazed at Follett's ability to weave such great stories into detailed historical events. And even though I've read many WWII books, I learned a few interesting tidbits through out the novel.<br /><br />It's a great story, expertly written, about a such an important time in our recent history.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the third installment.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is a strange but poignant short film worth seeing if you enjoy obscure B&W movies. Audio quality is lacking but fair overall, and the storyline and actors average for the era in which it was produced. I saw this on TCM last month and was moved by the real \\"freaks\\" who starred in it. While there is a creepy twist at the end, I wouldn't exactly call this a \\"chilling horror film\\" or find it especially frightening to watch as some reviewers have obviously overstated. Perhaps it was controversial and banned in 1932, but it's considerably mild on the fear & shock scale for 2012. While some viewers may be mildly uncomfortable with the level of human disability depicted or the patronizingly abusive behavior of the non-disabled entertainers, most will likely feel compassion for the plight and limitations of circus sideshow freaks. It's more appropriate to classify this type of movie with \\"The Elephant Man\\" than as a horror film.

B003CN4R74|4.0|Evanescence have always stood out in the hard rock/heavy metal world solely because they are one of the few groups to have a frontwoman (\\"woman\\" being the key word, there). Female vocalist Amy Lee may be only a mere five-foot, five-inches tall, but she sure belts out the songs like no other. Her stellar, soaring vocals wail magnificently over her band's crunchy musical backdrop. And she may have the whole gothic-look going on, but fortunately, Evanescence have a decent-sized bag of tricks up their sleeve -- and more than just a thick coating of mascara (and a glossy, thick-sounding production job).<br /><br />\\"What You Want\\" is a strong opener where Amy's vocals wail over a crunchy, churning lick and symphonic-esque keyboards. \\"Made Of Stone\\" is backed by a sludgy, pounding riff and some at times nearly thunderous rhythms. And a cool splash of piano adds some nice color and texture to the arrangements. Then following the stellar, soaring vocals and powerful, stirring chorus of \\"The change,\\" comes the album's first ballad. \\"My Heart Is Broken\\" is a beautiful piece of piano-driven balladry, although it is heavier than, say, \\"My Immortal.\\" Here, Amy attacks her demons with stellar, pensive, lung-stretching clean vocals -- and man, she can really hold a note! Back on the heavy side, \\"The Other Side\\" is centered around a sludgy, syncopated, and almost Meshuggah-esque riff and grungy-sounding bass lines. Other standouts include the hit-single-deserving \\"Sick\\"; the heavy, and positively head-bangable riffs and grumbling bass notes found in \\"End Of The Dream\\" and the surprisingly blistering \\"Never Go Back\\"; and a beautiful and very ambient closing power ballad called \\"Swimming Home.\\"<br /><br />Steering widely clear of falling into the usual nu-metal trap of ham-fisted rapping, Nirvana-derived cliche song structures, and forgettable melodies, and producing a consistently strong, eminently memorable, and astonishingly heavy new record, Amy Lee and the gang are at their peak, here. (\\"Evanescence\\" blows away both of the previous full-lengths released by the band.) And it ranks among the top twenty hard rock/heavy metal releases of 2011, thus making it a strongly recommended listen for fans and newcomers alike.here.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I find myself on this app and can't get off of it! Super addicting! Takes up a lot of my spare time :/
0345803485|1.0|I read the book because I had to know what the hype was about.  Well actually I only got 65% through before I know longer could bare it. There is one redeeming quality about the book. The heroines roommate. She is spunky and lives within reality. But the author did not write the book about her. Instead she based it on a stupid woman who falls for an unbelievable -- by unbelievable I mean there is no way this man exists -- man. She is graduating college but I feel like she missed all the developmental years between 12 and 21. Her maturity is that of an adolescent. I was hoping at least the sex would be good. I am afraid to say I think a man actually wrote those scenes. Please do not waste your time!!!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best books.  It was a \\"can't put it down\\" reader from start to finish. The sub-plots kept the reader wondering how it would all tie in together at the end. A great book!

B008Y5OW20|4.0|After so many years waiting for Jeff Lynne to make another solo album, the listener is greeted with a wonderful compilation of covers from days gone by. While Lynne definitely didn't write any of these songs, the arrangement and sound is all Lynne. You can hear his ethereal touch to each and every one of the songs. As I listened through the tracks, I saw that Love is A Many Splendored Thing was approaching and thought that this one could end up super cheesy. I was pleasantly surprised as Jeff took this wedding singer classic and made it his own.<br />Overall I was very satisfied with the album. The only reason I didn't score it a 5 star was because there was no new Lynne material on it. I am still waiting for that album.<br /><br />Thanks Jeff!

0345803493|3.0|This book started off really well.  I thought it was going to be the page-turner that the first one was.  However, it started to lag just a bit.  Still a very good read, just not as good as the first.  The characters became more cardboard (for lack of a better way to put it)  and it became predictable.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|I just didn't find this movie all that entertaining. There was little back story or character development. I could follow along since I'd seen most of the individual hero movies, but if you have not yet seen Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, etc...you will be scratching your head. This is a movie for comic fans only.<br /><br />Anyway, these random B-list superheroes come together to battle an alien invasion. A basic enough premise, but there was a lot of forced elements. The heroes all disliked each other for no particular reason. When they become a \\"team\\", it falls flat, because there isn't really any conflict between any of them. The selection of \\"Avengers\\" seems random. The Hulk, who inexplicably halfway through the movie can suddenly control his beast mode. Iron Man and Captain America, who seem reasonably paired. Thor (um, who?) who at least has a connection to the bad guy. And some guy and girl who can shoot arrows well and do a good round kick. Those two should have reasonably died within the first 5 minutes of the battle. If the hammer wielding God, an invincible giant monster, and a super robot suit that flies and shoots lasers is having a hard time with the alien invaders, I doubt a guy with 20 grenade tipped arrows and a girl with a 9mm is going to put up much of a fight.<br /><br />One of the \\"agents\\" is killed by the antagonist, and they all seem to be very upset about it, although the movie never establishes why this person is important to any of them. Then they fight a bunch of bad guys in a final act pulled straight from Transformers: Dark Moon. And then they split up. The end.<br /><br />All in all, a reasonable popcorn flick if you just want to see some mindless action.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I saw this at the movies a month I ago, unfortunately the sound was not that loud.  However, I knew that this was a real piece of music history.  This is simply one of the greatest bands of all time reborn for one night and proving why they are still important and relevant.  The set list is perfect, not one song is played less than stellar.  Page and Jones reconstruct every note with energy and passion while Plant's voice is still rich and powerful .  Jason Bonham is every bit his father's son recreating that Hammer of the Gods his father made famous.  This concert is not just some bunch of old geezers embarrassing themselves , this is a document of three rock veterans  (plus the reincarnation of their fourth partner) showing the young bands what true greatness really is.  This concert isn't just for Zeppelin fans, it's for all music lovers.  Oh, by the way, the blu ray disc sounds amazing and can be played oh so loud in surround sound.  The picture is crisp and vibrant, avoiding a lot of audience shots concentrating on the interaction between the band.  Get this set today and enjoy one of the greatest bands all over again.

0060254920|5.0|Just wanted to check in with you, now that you're gone.<br /><br />I wish you could have lived, to see the ringing defeat handed to the Republicans two weeks ago. It would have restored your faith in humanity, just at the point you were losing your faith in humanity, amidst scads of conservative imbecilities which you noted and rued personally in your radio interviews. I was sorry to hear you so saddened at the end of your life, about the GOP's feeble, fatalistic and contemptible ideas.<br /><br />But evil and ignorance do get vanquished now and then. It felt wonderful. I'm enjoying it for you.<br />Rest in peace, Maurice.

B0072IVGZG|1.0|I would like to preface this by saying that I am a huge Cult fan. I will go back and listen to Cult songs just as much as anything else in my 18,000 song ipod.I could think of at least 6 Cult tunes that are total hard rock classics.  So, it's not like I didn't give this a chance, but it is just shockingly bad. Especially after the last couple of albums: Beyond Good and Evil, heck,  even Born Into This had it's moments, but this thing is a turd from the word go. There are just no good songs here. At all. You have average, re-treaded, tired guitar riffs and a totally uninspired rhythm section, plus  a drunken Jim Morrison, I mean Ian Astbury (lol) spewing out one weirdo, pseudo-shaman  lyric after another. It just translates into a big bag of crap.<br />Let's hope this is not how a great band goes out.

B007Y1JGOY|4.0|This is easily a top notch album. There are a few flaws in the album that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 stars though. I love all the songs on the album except for Where Is The Blood, I Want You, and Are You Done With Me. The live bonus tracks aren't as great of a quality as they could be. This is still an album that everyone should have in their collection even though there are some mediocre songs on it. If the three songs I listed were better - this album would beat Lucidity by a long shot. However due to those three songs, Lucidity remains on top.

And that cut is Get Mine and well chosen for the commercial because it is THE best song on this cd, followed by Pressure & Time--from the the cd's name.

B000TU16GS|5.0|read this book in high school and could not put it down. The whole series is surprisingly consistent and is a very good read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am playing on my Kindle Fire, and I can't figure out how to send or receive gifts. I logged on to the game on my computer, was able to accept gifts, but then they never showed up on my Kindle. I would give 5 ***** if I could do that on my Fire. The updates to this game and the fact that I am now playing on a Kindle Fire HD are great and I can now honestly give the game a 5 star rating.

B003ZMF26W|5.0|A truly amazing mouse, where it meets every spec, and more. Just to get the only negative out of the way, the picture showed a wireless mouse, yet it was wired. The benefit, is it's faster reaction time, and the chord is long enough for my needs, which is a good 3 foot+ stretch, and it still has room. The lighting is one of the best parts, and the extra macro-keys push it over the edge for the price. it has an adjustable dpi control, so in the middle of a game you can tune it up or tune it down at the click of a button, with no pause. Better then all Razer products of the price range. Worth the cheap price.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I got the impression the author had to write a book to keep customers happy but to me he did not hit the mark at all.  I kept reading it in the hope it would get better but it failed terribly.  I only persevered with reading it in the hope that it would get better.  Certainly hope his next book is much much better otherwise he is not doing justice to THE MAN Jack Reacher !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I live out in the back of woop woop, Far North Queensland and so I pretty much have to learn everything by myself. The net is great but you try finding what you need on the WWW.<br />This book is not great, it's fantastic.I had so much TROUBLE with TOC and never did sus it until I downloaded this book (for free). I have bought several text books, used the free mobipocket converter at first, and ended up doing my books in XHTML (using dreamweaver, validating XHTML using W3C on the web, and converting them to mobi format using Calibre). If I had just found this book at the start it would have been so much easier.<br />I recommend this book to anybody, it is clear, concise and understandable (unlike much of the convoluted mumbo jumbo I have read).<br />If you want to upload your word doc straight to Amazon, without first getting a phd in ebook science then this book is a great place to start.<br />All the best Hank West.<br />[[ASIN:B006JOY32M Scorza Quest for Vengeance]]

B004V6BQ3O|3.0|On the bright side, this mic captures better audio than the craptastic internal mic. Also, it uses the internal cam battery as a power source (so no worrying about on/off switches and separate batteries).<br /><br />Sony makes a similar mic for the NEX line that is great. The Sony mic is directional and works well for interviews. This Nikon mic is not directional.<br /><br />So this mic is fine for ambient sound, but less effective for isolating a single audio source. Nikon needs to make a directional mic with this form factor.

B0091VGAXK|4.0|Fun, fun, fun.  Not the best movie ever made by a longshot, but golly is this just a fun ride with good music throughout.  The whole extended family went to see this in the theaters together, and got together in our living room as soon as we got the Blu-Ray.  The supporting case steals the show, but this should not be a surprise considering the relative no-names in the lead roles and the stellar cast supporting them.  Alec, Tom, Russell, Paul G., etc. all clearly had a lot of fun making this movie which makes it fun to watch.
B007KOMTUI|2.0|Instead of getting better, the show and the characters have become more predictable and even less likeable.<br />I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm not looking forward to Season 6

B007REV4T8|3.0|In this latest and most slapdash chapter in the re-envisioned James Bond saga, a hackneyed revenge plot is given such thin treatment that one wonders why it was approved for production.  Any film featuring Daniel Craig, especially as James Bond, will always be watchable to some degree, of course.  This movie, sadly, simply doesn't do the same justice to Craig/Bond (or even exist in the same universe, really) as the two which went before.  There isn't enough genuine Bond-movie material here to fill an after-school special.  (I will omit a full description of even the basics of the plot, to avoid spoiling it for readers who have not seen the movie, and will only discuss certain bits below.)<br /><br />Raoul Silva, though as well-played by Javier Bardem as possible, is in the end as thinly imagined and incredible as the rest of the story (Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre-- now, there was a villain!).  Sure, he's got a beef with M and her utilitarian ways.  Past that, he's completely cartoonish and unrealistic: one of the world's top six cryptanalysts who nevertheless has a taste for wet work?  Really?  Nor are his exploits in the least believable.  Purely fantastic computer shenanigans are juxtaposed with sheer logistical impossibilities.  For example-- even if one could get past all the misunderstandings of computer science that lead up to Silva's escape from his MI6 underground incarceration-- for Silva to have prepared an explosive charge in the subway tunnels just to send a train hurtling at Bond, enabling Silva to skedaddle up a ladder to safety, is sheer silliness.  Even if genius-badass Silva has memorized the London tram schedule and is up on all the latest delays, the timing required means that no proper genius-badass would rely on this as a defense mechanism.  Silva might as well have asked Bond to move two feet to the right to stand on a black painted X.<br /><br />Instead of showing understated cool as in the last two movies, the writers' and director's attemptsto use technology to spice things up in \\"Skyfall\\" result in frequent, unmitigated hogwash.  Movies such as \\"Iron Man\\" have apparently strengthened the holographic-computer-interface trope to such a degree that no hack screenwriter would be caught dead using a character to control a computer by any other means.  Not only must the computer be controlled in this way under the new regime, but it must be obvious to the viewer that a lot more is being accomplished this way than it would be with a traditional keyboard and mouse.  This gives rise in \\"Skyfall\\" to the rare treat of an alleged mathematician actually wrestling with a recalcitrant bit of encrypted data which actively resists him-- as if he could be inputting enough data in this way to actually decrypt anything, instead of using massively more powerful computer programs to do the necessary analysis and crunching-- and in the end the genius-encoded data is unraveled by Bond's noticing a plain-text word floating about in the data.  In other words, Silva's world-class encryption scheme is roughly as secure as cryptographic methods literally available in the time of Julius Caesar.  Any attempts to explain this away as an intentional trap of Silva's would be just as stupid, since someone of Q's alleged caliber would be expected to be skeptical of such an easy entry.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this scenario and other computer-related ones in the movie that simply remembering them gives rise to a migraine.  Now-humdrum asymmetric encryption techniques used  in every modern e-commerce shopping cart are worlds more secure than genius Silva's scheme.  Nor is it credible that Silva's gambit to hack MI6's ENTIRE NETWORK (without any built-in internal safeguards, apparently) by use of his own laptop being decrypted on-network by the hapless Q, would need to be triggered by someone recognizing an open-text phrase and triggering his malware.  MI6, in this bravely imagined new Bond cyberverse, ought to at leastinvest in a modern antivirus program, and maybe even invest in some sort of safe room where a COMPUTER OWNED BY THE WORLD'S FOREMOST CYBERTERRORIST COULD BE EXAMINED WITHOUT GIVING IT ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK.  Nor is it possible for static data to actively resist attempts to decrypt it.  In any event, modern data forensics examinations begin by saving an image of the data to be examined, just in case something goes awry and the data is corrupted or deleted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the extraordinary clunkiness of \\"Skyfall\\" doesn't end with this techy garbage; there are many other instances of clumsy plotting throughout the movie.  For example, in the big battle scene at Skyfall manor, when the gamekeeper attempts to hurry M to safety, Raoul Silva reacquires the pair because of the FLASHLIGHT BEAM BOBBING ACROSS THE MOORS-- despite the glare from the exploding and burning manor house which well illuminates the entire surrounding landscape.  How idiotic would one have to be to give away one's location in such circumstances?  And wouldn't Bond have been better off taking at least a few other agents with him to his retreat in the first place-- I mean, especially since he was trying to leave an obvious trail for Silva to follow?  Even as a man's man-- who believes in doing things himself, with an especial yen for diving without backup behind the wheel of old movie-prop cars to spray a few bullets, [ without any credible way of getting out of there afterwards-- did he really have to rely on a hunting rifle and a couple of moldy sticks of dynamite, when he could have had the pick of MI6's entire arsenal on his way out to the old homestead?<br /><br />My seven year old child employs better strategic thinking than this.  This sort of special \\"Skyfall\\" stupidity is not explainable by Bond's tendency to go full-tilt into a situation, counting on his wits and the element of surprise to help things come out right.  No, this was carefully considered stupidity based on Bond's years of experience in top-flight agentry.  In reality, of course, what happened was this: the screenwriter imagined a final confrontation involving just Bond, M, and Silva, and a big cast of characters and a bunch of believable weaponry and agent-fu would just have gotten in the way.  The screenwriter must have written that whole last booby-trap battle fresh off of a drunken marathon watching of the entire \\"Home Alone\\" franchise (including the straight-to-videos), and took the most straightforward route towards getting Bond and M out in the country with few resources: simply driving them straight there without any attempt at real explanation.<br /><br />There are also deplorably hokey in-jokes scattered throughout the movie.  For instance, the Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger, cheesy machine guns and all, is used as an actual important element in the defense of Skyfall manor.  This is a far cry from the few references in Casino Royale (e.g. \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\") that strongly signaled that this new Bond was not the smarmy cocktail-party jokester of old, but an entirely new creature.  The old Aston Martin and other gadgets, as well as some other touches, instead herald somewhat of a return to the Bond of old.  If so, legions of fans of the new, gritty Daniel Craig version stand to be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Here's hoping that future installments in the franchise show the same attention to freshness, artistry and detail that distinguished both \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Quantum of Solace\\".  As it is, for \\"Skyfall\\" to be mentioned in the same breath as the \\"Casino Royale\\" remake is a travesty of good taste.  \\"Skyfall\\" is most certainly not the best movie in the franchise, although from the frequency of that assertion, one wonders what particular brand of crack is making the rounds of Hollywood's critical circles these days.  My advice: if you haven't seen this movie, rent it at the Redbox (on DVD, to save a few pennies) to satisfy your curiosity, and have done with it.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Good simulation, as a pilot IRL,  it has authentic controls and reactions for the most part. One tip for the Carrier is to \\"perform the break\\" by flying over the middle of the Carrier at 1000 to 1800 feet to discern which end the wires are on..then peel around out to about a mile behind with the engines \\"spooled up\\" to 70% power or therebouts, controlling speed with the air brakes and land with enough power to \\"go around\\" if needed.

B005LAIHRC|5.0|I saw this movie on a theatre. At first I didn't get it but then I was hooked.<br />The characters are quite likeable. If you grew up in the 80s (as I did) you would relate to the Tower Record scene, hair spray, spandex, leg warmers, big hair, etc.  It´s a trip to the past.<br />Do not take this as a movie but as a long video music clip instead. Nothing to be serious about, this is just a very good entertaiment to share with anyone who belonged to the 80´s.<br /><br />There is a funny parody to boy bands like NKB, lip synch, and RAP music.<br />This is definitely a purchase rather than a rental. I have watched \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" scene a thousand times and can´t seem to have enough.

0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry's \\"pilgrimage,\\" so beautifully played out through Rachel Joyce's first novel, is done so in a way that, on the story's conclusion, you will find yourself both reluctant to say farewell to Harold and so thrilled that you were able to make the connection with him in the first place.  Once again it's too easy to give away pieces of a story that plays out over three hundred pages; instead, take this walk with Harold,a man convinced that, in walking to a friend not seen for years, he can keep her alive.  Queenie's brief note to Harold, her thanking him for his many kindnesses to her as they had worked together some twenty years earlier, her informing him that she was dying of cancer, is what sets in motion this journey, this journey toward both redemption of sorts and self-realization.  In a way it's a \\"coming of age\\" story as Harold, often alone in his isolation and pain as he walks the many miles to reach Queenie, has the time to look back on what made him \\"him,\\" what undermined his marriage to wife Maureen, what brought him to his late sixties and the man that he has become.  I guarantee you...you will be pulled into this story...you will walk, so frequently in great pain (oh, those damned yachting shoes!), with Harold as he examines his marriage to Maureen, his \\"failures\\" in being a father, his inability to relate to and appreciate the people around him...it's a journey to an ending that will both sadden yet be cause for celebration.  Harold is a character of fiction who will stay with you long after you reach the book's final page.  And Rachel Joyce's first effort is one that will leave you anxious for what is to come from this writer as she works through her second piece of fiction.

1616960922|5.0|As usual with Sanderson, the characters feel real, the magic system is intricate and well-thought-out, and most importantly everything works together to form a rich world and an interesting plot that could only exist in that world; everything is a piece of a puzzle and none could be transplanted elsewhere.<br /><br />I think this may be the perfect introduction to Sanderson's work for those who have not read him, as the story contains pretty much everything that characterizes his writing in a much shorter form. It can be hard to expect a new (or skeptical) reader to dive into a long novel like Mistborn or The Way of Kings, but a 6 hour read is an easy sell, and sure to hook anyone who might like the rest of his work. I may purchase a second copy just to lend out.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Sanderson, I am continually impressed by your masterful creativity.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book of the Trilogy was the most captivating.  It ended horribly but picked right up again in the 2nd book.  The series is really one long book requiring you to purchase 3 series to get to the end.  I was very mesmerized by the first book, less so by the 2nd and was ready for the end before the end in the third. In my opinion, it was too intense to support 3 books.  For me, it was a fresh approach to a romance novel.  I enjoyed it, would recommend it to certain friends, but do not think it is for everyone.  The reader needs to be open to sexual experimentation to fully enjoy them.

B00A12VW86|4.0|OK, there are way too many \\"I'm a big fan but I hated this\\" reviews.  Compared to Uno there's perhaps a small dip in first-to-last consistency, but that doesn't take away from the party-all-night, consequences-be-damned energy here.  Some so-called fans perhaps can't see the natural progression borne from the Foxboro Hot Tubs (and, dare I say, Pinhead Gunpowder - blow through Compulsive Disclosure & Goodbye Ellston Avenue and come back to Dos and tell me this doesn't work as a fast, cool, go-for-it album) side works integrated near-seamlessly into the post-Warning era... (by the way, if Uno came out in 2002 like it should have (or did in an alternate universe) it wouldn't've worked out nearly as well as it does now)<br />My faves thus far: Lazy Bones (a Billie Joe confessional, as it turns out), Makeout Party, Stop When Red Lights Flash, Ashley.  And get off \\"Nightlife\\" - geez, if it's not \\"all songs sounds the same\\" it's \\"eww, why did they try that?\\".  I find the trite axiom \\"opinions can't be wrong\\" to be so untrue when it comes to reviews.....
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I waited a year to review this Pink Floyd album in case my initial opinion of this fine compilation changed.  Quite simply, no, my opinion remains unchanged.  A Foot in the Door is still a great 1-disc compilation of the best of Pink Floyd.<br /><br />So what is it you ask, well, it is 80 minutes of Pink Floyd from mostly 1973 forward and was part of the Why Pink Floyd campaign. To me, the Why Pink Floyd campaign was designed to bring forth the re-mastered Pink Floyd catalogue, but mainly to highlight Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall and ultimately sell more copies of those already established excellent albums.  In that vein, A Foot in the Door continues that directive by representing those 3 albums with 12 of the 16 tracks.  So if you are not familiar with Pink Floyd, then this compilation will introduce you to their very best.  If you are already a fan, then this disc will remind you of all the reasons Why Pink Floyd is essential.<br /><br />OK, so what isn't A Foot in the Door?  Well, it isn't a career spanning anthology.  Outside of \\"See Emily Play\\" which is included to represent the Syd Barrett-led Pink Floyd, all the songs are from Dark Side of the Moon and forward.  This makes sense because before Dark Side, Pink Floyd only marginally sold records. It also isn't a greatest hits album because as other reviewers have pointed out, Pink Floyd is not a greatest hits band, but instead an album band.  However, A Foot in the Door doesn't do anything to diminish the full album experience of the original albums where the tracks were taken.  Instead it is a new full album experience of its own as the songs flow in and out of each other.  It also isn't the single cd set that most hard-core Pink Floyd fans would settle on for themselves, but I think we can all agree with most of the song selections presented as being the best and/or representative of the different sides of the multi-faceted talent that was/is Pink Floyd.  Sure there are some good pre-DSOTM tracks missing, but let's face it, they were all build up to what Pink Floyd was to become, with maybe the exception of the song Echoes which is an outstanding track and really showed Pink Floyd what they could do and was a catalyst for their greater works to follow.  AFITD also isn't all inclusive of the post DSOTM years as nothing from Animals is represented (I would have liked for them to include Pigs on the Wing Parts 1 and 2 as a combined edit).<br /><br />Anyway, this 1 disc set does truly represent the best of the re-mastered Pink Floyd as directed by the Why Pink Floyd campaign and for the price, it is a great deal too.e-DSOTM tracks missing, but let's face it, they were all build up to what Pink Floyd was to become, with maybe the exception of the song Echoes which is an outstanding track and really showed Pink Floyd what they could do and was a catalyst for their greater works to follow.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love reading Nelson DeMille, especially the John Corey series. I love the difficult and sometimes terrifying situations he finds himself in and just when things seem to be so very tense, he makes a funny or \\"smart ass\\" statement that breaks the tension. I've read all of the John Corey series and although \\"The Lion's Game\\" is still my favorite (probably because that is the one I read first), The Panther is now my second favorite in the series. If you like Nelson DeMille and especially if you enjoy the John Corey series, I'd especially recommend this book for you.

I couldn't tell you what happened after the first 15 minutes because we shut it off.  The acting was lame and the dancing wasn't enough to keep my attention or make it worth watching.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|What a deal. 20 bucks for all this. 4 movies plus every movie with a separate special edition as well. 2 extra discs with as a ton of extras too. Comes in a pretty cool book that holds all the discs. If you have any interest in any of the Alien films then you have to pick this one up. It's simply a must buy!!!
0446580848|2.0|I was so eagerly awaiting this book; have read every Nelson DeMille book ever published and love the characters of Kate & John, and was thrilled when I heard Paul Brenner was going to be joining the fun.  This book could have been cut by 30% as the verbiage is regurgitated to the point that instead of savoring every word I was skipping pages at a time.  I expect so much more from Mr. DeMille.

B00984668E|4.0|Basically the title track and Execrator are the songs that really jam. Everything else is ok to very good. Out of all there albums this may be the \\"worst\\" but it's still really good. It's hard to rate this lower than 4 stars because to me the title track is probably my favorite Sword song of ANY album besides possibly \\"Freya\\" or \\"Black River\\" (The Conan Song).<br /><br />It's a solid album with cool live tracks. Don't take my \\"worst\\" album seriously you may like it more than I did but I prefer faster more thrashy songs like on Gods of the Earth.<br /><br />Also, if I may comment the drums are very good but I still miss Wingo.
0761169253|5.0|I saw a post about this book awhile back on somebody's blog-I don't remember where, and I was intrigued by the title. So, it went on my reading list.<br /><br />A little book by author, Austin Kleon, which states; :10 things nobody told you about being creative\\".<br />Nothing is original; everything comes from something, the book lightly states, and includes thought provoking ideas and statements for artists, creators, and writers, amoung others. The author shares some topics such as: using your hands, do good work and share it, and be nice- to name a few.<br /><br />A few of my favorite quotes that I found in the book: \\"plagiarism is trying to pass someone else's work off as your own, copying is about reverse-engineering....\\" (see page 33)<br />Kleon talks later about sharing your process, he states: \\"not to worry about giving your secrets away, you can share your dots without connecting them\\". (page 85)<br />And, \\"the worst thing a day job does is take time away from you, but does give you a daily routine so you can schedule time for your creative work\\" (page 124). I find this one to be true!<br /><br />It's a quick, enjoyable read that I do recommend!

B0058YPL66|5.0|Bought this item because I had missed a few shows when it was first shown on TV & I wanted to get caught up with the story line. But have found that I really enjoyed watching the whole season from beginning to end & being able to take in so much more information from the story line. Have really enjoyed picking up all the little &#34;easter eggs&#34; lying around in both Mr. Golds antique shop & his castle. Each disk of the 5 disk set has a commentary on a key episode contained on that disk. Have been able to get a really good feel for the characters & the story line. Planning to purchase season 2 when it comes out even though I have so far been able to catch every episode this season.

034553154X|2.0|I bought the 2011 calendar -- which had illustrations of beautiful castles -- which I loved. I had the calendar on the wall of my cube at the office & others really liked it & I got lots of positive comments about it.  Because of this, I thought the 2012 calendar would be just as beautifully illustrated -- so I purchased it and when I received I noticed illustrations that would not be appropriate for the \\"work environment\\".  Unfortunately, before I purchased, I was NOT able to get a glimpse of the contents and was very disappointed once I got the 2012 calendar.  And now, I was wondering if the 2013 calendar would more appropriate for work.  Luckily, Amazon let's you take a peek inside & I was able to see that 2013 calendar also includes illustrations that I could not display on the wall of my cube.  Very disappointing and inappropriate -- but thankful I could \\"look\\" before I purchased.

0143119419|3.0|\\"Why is it, particularly in the financial industry, we see such limitless greed? You have to look at the nature of money. Money is not like a commodity, commodities need inputs, money doesn't need any inputs, so from the supply-side there is no constraint whatsoever, you can produce it in limitless quantities, technically speaking. Now from the demand side, the demand for money is equally limitless. So you have limitless demand and supply, in principle constrained only by regulation. So people operating in such a system if you de-regulate it, you automatically get limitless behavior.\\" - Dirk Bezemer<br /><br />In the useful part of the book, Sebastian Mallaby takes us through a brief history of hedge funds. Hedge funds are defined by their 20% performance fees, their ability to go long and short, and their obscene use of leverage. Mallaby focuses on the heads of the most successful funds and describes some of the great financial booms and busts as seen from their eyes.<br /><br />In the less useful PR part of the book, Mallaby gets an opportunity to indulge in his worship of money, incessantly reminding us of a fund's size and rate of return. And more troublingly he engages in an apologia for the hedge funds and their operators.<br /><br />First you have to understand that Mallaby is about establishment as you can get---son of the UK ambassador to France, Eton, Oxford, Washington Post editorial board, Council of Foreign Relations. His goal as dutiful public relations flack to his class is to convince us (basically the 99%) that hedge funds are on balance good (or at least no worse than any other institutional investment vehicle) and would do an even better job if...wait for it...they were less regulated.<br /><br />For example, he defends a particularly noxious fund manager---used insider knowledge to make trades, controlled shadow \\"third markets\\", cornered a Treasury auction and then applied a short squeeze on investors---with the vapid defense that such sociopathic behavior was good for the economy. That is, we should accept the crimes (never proven!) because on balance the fund manager helped the economy. Astonishing.<br /><br />Another way Mallaby defends hedge fund managers is to tell us that hedge funds actually do something for the real economy---provide liquidity or risk insurance, or allocate capital to those who can best use it, or something. But in actuality they make computer-automated trades in millionths of a second, not knowing or caring what it is they are trading.<br /><br />The history shows hedge funds can be destructive to ordinary men and women. Soros's attack on the English pound and Thai bhat are discussed in the book but it's mitigated in Mallaby's eyes because Soros wasn't completely predatory in bringing about the collapse of all the East Asian economies. Today, great reserves of dollars must be held by foreign governments to stave off speculative attacks from hedge funds. When it comes to choosing between funding an inoculation program or buying Treasury Bills, the governments, for their own safety, have to choose T-bills. And in so doing reinforce the US-dominated global financial system. This bigger picture seems lost on Mallaby.<br /><br />Written in the wake of the global financial crisis, Mallaby offers hedge funds as an alternative to banks to manage risk. Although he puts in a plug for progressive taxation, the main message of the book is that hedge funds have it all handled, get out of their way. Here I take Bezemer's side and say that's asking for trouble.c behavior was good for the economy.

0307596885|5.0|What can be said about Alice Munro's luminous writing that hasn't already been said? What unused plump adjectives might be bandied about to describe her way with words? What turn of phrase or simile might once again skirt the edge of capturing her unparalleled ability to so aptly describe those quiet moments in life that can change everything in a flash? Crossroads, they are called. A lightning bug trapped inside a jar, now free. Her latest collection, DEAR LIFE, is all of those flashy adjectives and overextended metaphors. It's everything you want it to be, and more.<br /><br />Munro has written 12 other short story collections as well as a few volumes of selected previously published stories and one novel. You'd think with this many published stories in her back pocket that maybe she'd retrace her steps, write the same story but with different characters, rely on a well-tread formula or two for some of the \\"filler\\" in the book. But such is not the case. While many reoccurring themes are explored, DEAR LIFE is as fresh and illuminating as any of her previous collections, if not more so. As another reviewer so fittingly put it, \\"there are no clunkers here.\\"<br /><br />\\"To Reach Japan,\\" the first entry in the collection, finds Greta and her young daughter Katy on a train to Toronto to housesit a friend's home for a month while Greta's husband --- and Katy's father --- begins a new job elsewhere. While on the journey, the normally quiet and contained Greta gets too deep in the drink with a younger fellow they meet on the train and, in a moment of lusty abandon, loses track of Katy. Of course, mother and daughter are reunited, but not without Greta feeling the full weight of what might have happened. Still, it doesn't stop her from kissing back when a newspaper columnist she met at a party a few months earlier greets her on the platform in Toronto. As the pins line up, there's plenty to noodle over in this brief glimpse into the life of a subconsciously unhinged motherpossibly unhappy in her marriage, definitely looking for a change.<br /><br />In \\"Leaving Maverley,\\" Morgan, a half-curmudgeonly small town movie theater projectionist, and his doting wife take a wayward girl named Leah under their wing who, not long after, runs off with the minister's son. As is often the case in Munro's stories, time isn't kind to any of the three, doling out tragedy in droves. Leah's marriage fails, causing her to lose her children. But it's Morgan's loss of his wife (to cancer) that stings the most. \\"But the emptiness in place of her was astounding.... What he carried with him, all he carried with him, was a lack, something like a lack of air, of proper behavior in his lungs, a difficulty that he supposed would go on forever.\\"<br /><br />Tackling loss --- and blame --- from a different angle, \\"Gravel\\" is the story of two sisters who live in a ramshackle trailer by a water-filled quarry after their mother left their sturdy, boring father for a younger, wilder man. When one sister drowns in the gravel pit on the other's watch, there's no question who is to blame. Their mother, a little too wild? The boyfriend, too stoned to jump in and save her? Or the narrator who stood by, watching her sister drown? As you might expect, it's the dead sister's voice that calls out the strongest here: \\"Caro keeps running at the water and throwing herself in, as if in triumph, and I'm still caught, waiting for her to explain to me, waiting for the splash.\\"<br /><br />Death. Love. Loss. Guilt. Shame. Lust. Loneliness. It's all poured over the coals in the stories throughout DEAR LIFE. But here's the kicker. There's an unprecedented finale tacked on at the book's end. Here, 81-year-old Munro writes, \\"The final four works in this book are not quite stories. They form a separate unit, one that is autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact. I believe they are the first and last --- and the closest --- things I have to say about my own life.\\" [!!!] While these selections show none of the careful kneading and precise crafting so present in her fiction, it's perhaps just that raw, messy stream-of-consciousness that makes them so interesting to read.<br /><br />** As a reviewer's side note, here's a tip: If you have access to the Winter 2012 issue of Granta, pick it up. Why? Aside from the fact that it's a well-curated journal that highlights the latest and greatest stories from Literary Greats such as Munro, this particular issue includes a story entitled \\"In Sight of the Lake\\" that is also included in DEAR LIFE. Here, an aging woman who seems to be losing her memory embarks on a drive in search of an \\"Elderly Specialist.\\" As one might expect, she loses her way and has difficulty finding the doctor's office. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say, the ending in DEAR LIFE and the ending in Granta *aren't the same!* I'm not sure I've ever had the pleasure of being treated to two slightly dissimilar endings that resonate very differently on the palate. It's an exercise that not only shows readers the myriad paths a story could follow, but also Munro's writing process as well.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alexis Burling

Within each notebook, there are formats for different needs ... diary, address book, business, agenda, calendar, etc.  On each page you can type, hand write, add voice, photos, videos, graphics, etc. ... basically whatever you need to make it yours. You can also password protect your notebook. In addition, the developer has free add on packs for the diary and notebook.  Also, there are hints to help you navigate and  design your pages and notebooks. Absolutely love this app!
0385536828|5.0|\\"I was described as an `undercover agent', working for MI5, Cambridge educated, a `specialist' in mathematics, based in London, given the task of liaising with Tom Haley to facilitate a generous stipend.\\"<br /><br />Forced to study maths, Serena Frome always preferred English, having read novels with a passion. Maybe that's why she accepted the position with MI5 aimed at finding authors whose ideas the government felt furthered its interests. Of course, the writers had no idea where the liberal funding was coming from.<br /><br />Now, nearly 40 years later, Serena writes her life story, at least the part that involved her time with the English security service. In the early 1970s, women held mostly clerical jobs, assistant to the assistant type of roles. Even so, when Serena is recruited for service, she feels privileged. But she soon realizes that she is at the bottom of the bottom.<br /><br />A former lover has put in a good word for her, allowing her to be looked at for a position in a program that the Information Research Department is calling \\"Sweet Tooth.\\" Her job would be to check out the writing of several up-and-coming authors and encourage them in their craft, ostensibly through an arts foundation. If all goes well, they would never know where the money came from.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't quite work out that way. The candidate Serena has chosen is a man named Tom Haley, who is struggling to make ends meet. Early on, Serena realizes that, not only does she love Tom's stories, she loves Tom himself. It isn't long before they begin seeing each other. Once the affair has started, Serena knows that she must confess her secret, but she is a romantic without courage. She is also a woman with a past, and now it comes back to haunt her --- in a big way. Soon she doesn't know who to trust, and her usual bad judgment leads her to faulty conclusions. Who has betrayed her? She knows that someone has and that it likely will cost her her job, maybe even her lover. She just hopes it won't cost her her life.<br /><br />Set in the early 1970s, SWEET TOOTH portrays a government that is engaging in odious thought manipulation as though it were the norm. It depicts the repressive role women played in the workplace back then, and reveals the time to be pivotal in the easing of some stereotypes. It's a historical romp around London and Brighton, with a small peek inside MI5. Besides weaving fact and fiction into a rich fabric, Ian McEwan gives us a romance wrapped around a spy thriller, rife with sex and love, trust and suspicion, hope and despair.<br /><br />And, as Serena reads Tom's stories, growing deeper involved with each one, she also allows us a glimpse at his writing, such that we are treated to stories within the story.<br /><br />With his usual attention to detail and flair for description, McEwan gives us Serena Frome, a complex character fraught with flaws --- and his first female protagonist since 2001's ATONEMENT. She possesses almost fatally poor judgment, making one bad decision after another. Readers are treated to a look back at the wreck she made of her life, seen now from the perspective of a woman in her 60s. At the end of the book, one is left wondering if she finally made the right decision. What happened after the last page was turned?<br /><br />Reviewed by Kate Ayers
B005UD1D62|5.0|I'm a 15 year old girl so naturally I would like this book. Lauren Conrad is a good author. This book is great for summer reading and all though I haven't read the LA Candy series yet I am sure its good too. The Fame Game is a page turner for sure. It keeps you guessing and there is never a dull moment. The characters have a great plot too. So if your looking for a good book, I would suggest this one.
141659521X|5.0|Over the past couple of years, Vince Flynn has been filling in the early, or \\"hidden,\\" years of Mitch Rapp, the covert CIA agent who many of us hope has a real-world model out there. While the recently published AMERICAN ASSASSIN and KILL SHOT told the story of Rapp's origin, Flynn's latest places him very much in the here and now. Rapp is an uncompromising irresistible force capable of knocking any object in his way off its pins. THE LAST MAN finds Rapp in his 40s, extremely capable, but physically if not emotionally vulnerable as he faces enemies from within and without while in pursuit of a security breach that threatens to expose CIA assets to America's enemies throughout the world.<br /><br />The novel begins in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, with Rapp in the middle of the aftermath of carnage. Such is not an unusual place for him; what is unusual in this particular case is that he is not the cause of it. The situs is a safe house set up around Joe Rickman, the head of CIA clandestine operations in Afghanistan; the house has been compromised, with Rickman's bodyguards murdered, his all-important computer gone, and Rickman himself missing, an apparent kidnapping victim. Irene Kennedy, the director of the CIA, has tasked Rapp with investigating Rickman's abduction and finding him, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Rapp is disturbed by what he finds; there are some things that simply do not add up at the scene. He is not entirely sure of what has actually occurred; what neither he nor Kennedy realize, though, is that Rapp is slowly being drawn into a trap, one in which he will be confronted with one of his deadliest adversaries, someone who has cost Rapp more than perhaps anyone ever has. Events conspire to make the two men uneasy allies in a firestorm where they are confronted with almost overwhelming odds. But the question remains: Who is orchestrating these events, which include Rickman's disappearance and the attack against Rapp?<br /><br />Matters becomes even more dangerous when a shocking video is posted on the Internet that leaves Kennedy scrambling and Rapp looking for answers. The trail Rapp follows leads from the violent streets of Afghanistan to the twisted hallways of power in Washington, D.C., where a corrupt politician conspires with a power-hungry bureaucrat to bring Rapp down and Kennedy with him, even at the cost of the lives of CIA intelligence sources working behind enemy lines. Rapp has a good idea as to who is pulling the strings, and as the twists and turns of the plot against the CIA are slowly uncovered, he will need to utilize every element he possesses in his considerable skill set to come out alive.<br /><br />Surprises abound here. These are not limited to plot change-ups; events conspire to reveal a couple of hitherto unknown sides of Rapp's personality. Additionally, he does something that is totally necessary but undoubtedly will have a number of readers screaming \\"No!\\" even as he... But that would be telling. Certainly, THE LAST MAN is one of Flynn's most complex installments in the Rapp canon to date. And Flynn, master storyteller that he is, skillfully navigates the reader through the twists and turns of the tale to a conclusion that puts the main plot elements to rest while setting up the next intriguing volume.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

0062073486|5.0|This book is a suspenseful read- it's killer! It will scare you at times as the guests go insane in their own ways.<br />It is an action-packed novel with many twists and turns. The fact that the crimes are based on a nursery rhyme adds a childish cruelty to it. We loved the remote macabre setting on Indian Island.<br /><br />Our guess as to who the murderer was continually changed; a suspicious character would die and we'd be kept guessing. Suspicion is placed on everyone, making it easier or harder (depending on how you look at it) to like or dislike specific characters. The actual deaths are so creepy that it will give you chills.<br /><br />Even when you are finished reading the book you'll spend many days after thinking about it. This book is awesome-- we recommend it!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Growing up playing the video games of the 80s and 90s, this book served as a fun blast from the past. All of the old video game and movie references brought back memories of a time where life was much less stressful. The book is a great blend of real world sci-fi drama and virtual reality sci-fi drama. The story switches back and forth between in-game story and the main character's real-world problems. The in-game scavenger hunt could lead to real world riches. The story and characters are just so much fun. Highly recommended, entertaining read!

B002BI6SMI|4.0|This is an action thriller, well suited to those who enjoy this type of movie.  While I usually don't rush to see these, I really did enjoy this movie.  The main character wins every fight, and hundreds of rounds of high powered ammo was shot at him without a single hit; so that was kind of like watching a Superman episode.  But it was a good enough story and it was entertaining.  The bad guys were so bad, and the hero was so unappreciated by his ex wife and daughter that the viewer had to root for him in every way and there was no pressure about a possible sad ending.

I was all jazzed about reading these books based on all the hype and while the first was really a page turner by the last I was disappointed to find out this was just another romance novel.  Also, there seemed to be many questions left unanswered about all of the characters, especially our heroine, Ana.

141659521X|3.0|I have read all of Flynn's books to date, and this one is a good addition to the Mitch Rapp series. There is nothing really wrong with it, but I found it to be a bit too similar to the past offerings. There is little that happens in this book that we haven't seen before. All of it is exciting and well written, but some new twist is needed. Essentially all of the books feature:<br />- liberal members of congress or the senate trying to undermine the CIA's work and throw Rapp and company in jail<br />- Rapp disregarding orders and policy to get the job done<br /><br />This book is no exception. I would like to see Flynn find some new direction to add interest. It makes for a good read as it is, but this series is starting to all blur together.

1451613512|5.0|Stone and Kuznick have written a valuable companion and counterpoint to the woefully incomplete version of history we are taught in schools. The fact that much of what is inside this book is old hat to real students of history but new (and perhaps threatening) to the public at large is proof that feel-good political correctness exists for conservatives too and that this feel-good political correctness is the real scourge of public education. Kuznick and Stone didn't write this book to tell us that we, as Americans, can't have heroes. They are simply of the opinion and desire that General Patton should share the perch with figures like Henry Wallace and that the initial assessment of Harry Truman's abilities by his contemporaries proved to be correct. So, don't listen to the howling from the Right about Stone and Kuznick \\"hating America\\". Even if true patriotism really does mean loving your country regardless of whether it's wrong or right, there's still no shame in voicing a strong preference for right. More than anything that is what Stone and Kuznick are trying to tell us.

B004LROUW2|5.0|I loved this book. Murakami is an amazing writer and all his ability is wonderfully displayed in this book. The story is extremely well crafted and the characters' descriptions make them jump right out of the page. They are so real and yet the story is so out of the ordinary. To me, Murakami is the intersection where Paul Auster meets Garcia Marquez. I've had the opportunity of reading really amazing books this year and I can say without doubt this one has been my favorite. For some reason I had postponed reading this book, I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it that much...Boy was I wrong....

1609611543|1.0|In the beginning of the book he spoke as though taking wheat out of the diet would make you loose weight fast. I removed it completely from my diet for one month. During this time I finished the book. Mr. David went on in his book to say, &#34;Of course you shouldn't replace wheat with other high calorie foods....in other words his book was about cutting back on calories to loose weight. Wow, what a new idea, cut back on calories and you will loose weight.<br /><br />I can see that the wheat of today raises the blood sugar in a way that old wheat did not. Good idea to have options to buy ancient wheat. But cutting the wheat out is about calories.

B007TK77QE|4.0|I will (like many others here) preface my review by saying definitively that \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" couldn't possibly be further removed from the land of Harry Potter. This is a mature book that aims to some extent to strike at the literary fiction market. One gets the feeling that Rowling has somehow made a challenge to herself to write something that is significantly more challenging (to read) than anything else she has accomplished; the challenge in this case lies in the equivocal portrayal of people in \\"TCV\\". It's this subtle point, I think, that many one-star reviews have failed to grasp: the human psyche is complex and can't help what it thinks - people are not simply \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\". Of course I sympathise with the expectations of her fans and their adventurous excursion to non-fantasy realms (many of my friends who only have read fantasy have dipped their toes in other waters for the first time with this book), however one must not approach a book with your own prejudices - absorb and discard that which appeals to you or has truth to it.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy follows the lives of a large cast of characters (about 60 of them) in a small village in Britain; the way that they deal with each other and their loved ones - and the repercussions of those dealings, intended or not. It's a finely balanced novel, that is well thought-out; with the narratives eliding with ease. It's an excellent show of craftsmanship to blend these stories together and simultaneously keep them believable and interesting. There are many touching moments in the story, and many, many, many horrifying and gritty happenstances.  I felt, after reading the book, that I was genuinely interested and intrigued by the lives of the citizens of Pagford - my judgement of their actions are not important, what is important is the realism with which Rowling portrays the little undercurrents in human relations, the rancour and spite: the thoughts and feeling that we dare not admit to anyone (often, not even ourselves) that we have.<br /><br />People, are not nice. They are riddled with imperfections and often hurt one another by exploiting this precise fact - that is one of the topoi in the novel; to recognise that there are molesters, prostitutes, pedophiles, adulterers, and sometimes just plain nasty (Fats, I'm looking at you) individuals who roam among us under the guise of suburban bliss is to my mind, an important, albeit borrowed idea - that was excellently executed in the novel. Yes, the novel is harsh and at times distasteful, but that is no reflection of the novellist proper - Rowling is merely portraying the realities of her conception. Indeed, the novel has many other qualities that are notable - chief among them is her surprising ability to write beautiful sentences effortlessly.<br /><br />An endlessly fascinating account of how the pushes and pulls of daily life lead to inexorable conclusions and overarching, life-changing shifts in our understanding of how we relate to our family, friends, and community. A damn good read.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Make no mistake about it, Lincoln is a movie full of talking, talking and more talking. There is very little action, but the script and acting are second to none. It also somehow found room for some really good humor. Sure the history is off here and there and it does have a few moments where it seems to drag, but Steven Spielberg has crafted a fine telling of the last months of Lincoln's life and the passing of the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis spent a year preparing for this role and not only does he look like Lincoln (you don't even have to squint your eyes) he pours every ounce of facial and vocal expression to the point where you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen. He speaks both softly and wisely, with a good story always ready to share with others. I think come February he will be the first man to win 3 lead acting Oscars (he should have won for Gangs of New York too). Sally Field, Hal Holbrook, James Spader and countless other familiar faces are all excellent, but Tommy Lee Jones stands out the most of the supporting cast. You can't help but love his character and he supplies many of the laughs.<br /><br />I'll admit that without the fine performances the movie would likely be a tad on the boring side since it's all word play and no explosions, but due to the dedication put forth you will feel like you've been transported to back to 1865.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

1439152802|5.0|The thing I love about Kate Morton's books is the realization it gives you that people older than you really do have a life you never knew about. We forget to ask our parents/relatives what life was like as a teen and young person, what went wrong, how they learned things, their special loves and heartbreaks, their college or work successes and failures, what they remember from their childhood, what kind of things hurt them. Kate has a way of getting you to see the world and others in a totally different light.<br />I found the book fascinating in story and character and read it in only a couple days (I am a very SLOW reader). I couldn't wait to get back to it each time. There was maybe a tedious part here or there but every book has a section like that. There were parts I was a little lost but the story kept me going and I was able to pick up the meaning later on. I can't wait for her next book.

B009KKLQKO|4.0|first of all I Disagree with the other people who bash this release. this collection was great despite mike love being a giant tool box. it was nice to see Brian, AL and David on stage with mike and Bruce after all these years. brian did a great job putting in his voice where Carl would have. Brian's band was exceptional adding to the background of the show, their definitely better than mike loves group, in fact i have a sneaking suspicion that maybe the reason the others were fired by love. i know that brian and al are way better  singers than mike and his son cristain. the track listing was great a mix of everything. now heres the critique part for me, AL should have had more lead vocals and i agree with the other reviewers that this dvd should have been longer with more songs but it was indeed magical.  buy this collection its worth it
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Definitely not as good as the first book but continues the storyline. A bit repetitive after reading the first book in the series. Quick and easy read.

B007KOYEOC|3.0|I read this book because of all the hype and I had read the previous books. This 3rd book in the series completes the story however is written simply and is somewhat repetitive in ideas from the previous books. There are some twists however these are not expanded in the writing and in each event the author moves on pretty quickly. If you need a quick and easy read then this is for you (of course if you have read the previous 2 books to get the background story). If you are looking for some literacy quality then this is not the book for you.

B007EE564U|4.0|After the prequel \\"American Assassin\\" it was great to see the return of the more mature and experienced Mitch Rapp we have followed in so many books, especially the Rapp who can face up to enemies of all kinds, both in the field and the bureaucracy.<br /><br />Vince Flynn has written a clever book set in the current international environment, from DC to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is very realistic without making you think about the current players in the field. This time Irene Kennedy, Flynn's head of the CIA features heavily as the experienced, influential and almost unflappable professional head of the CIA. I hardly had a thought about the recent real incumbent who didn't understand that his private life affected his public responsibilities.<br /><br />I loved the parts where Rapp doesn't tolerate fools, especially when things are going wrong. \\"... the answer to your question...I think you are an imbecile. There could be some underlying physchological issues as well....beyond that I'm pretty sure you're stupid.\\" \\"Let me explain how this works. We're the folks you call in when the shit hits the fan.\\"<br /><br />I really loved the character of a 4 foot 11 inch female behemoth - USAF \\"Command Master Sargent\\" Sanchez - who ran the intensive care ward of a military hospital in Afghanistan where Rapp was recovering from one of his usual close encounters with violence. Sanchez was able, single-handedly and without any weapons, to protect Rapp from an invasion of a troop of FBI agents. With such a CV I hope she has a future on Irene's administrative staff....Rapp and Sanchez would make a mean combination!<br /><br />The plot is fast moving and mostly believable and this time some goodies become baddies and baddies become goodies. Flynn also leaves us with a couple of violent characters that I am sure will re-emerge in later books. I scored the book at 4.5 stars because of a few inconsistencies in the plot.<br /><br />In his prologue Flynn mentions plans for a Mitch Rapp movie based on \\"American Assassin\\". On checking, I find that Australian actor Chris Hemsworth (the Thor movies) is currently expected to  play the young Mitch Rapp.  This looks a far better choice than Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.app movie based on \\"American Assassin\\".

Well, I guess if your only music exposure is through pop radio, you'll just keep wondering only until somehow you stumble upon this concert. See, obviously, outside Mayer's tabloid-worthy personal life, he IS first and foremost one of the greatest singer/songwriter and guitarist of our generation. So next time if you hear someone dismiss John Mayer as that \\"cheesy Your Body is Wonderland singer\\", just bitch slap him/her with this concert DVD and call it a day.

Breaking out of the mold, this movie has heart and shows that happy endings don't have to include a prince every time. Sometimes, that happy ending comes in the form of your family. Sometimes that happy ending is found in your own heart. Loved it and recommend it for everyone.

0761169431|4.0|This is a great book for anyone that loves Star Wars and origami. There are two printed sheets for each folding project. I bought it for my 9 year old son, but even the easier projects are pretty difficult for him. I thought it was something he could do on his own (he has done origami before), but inevitably I have to help him out. Some of the instructions seem a little unclear to me, even though I grew up doing origami. But overall my son loves the book and has enjoyed reading it and &#34;trying&#34; to fold the projects
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book for a few months and now that I have my thoughts on this book range from frustration to complete apathy. I knew going into Room that it would be narrated by a 5 year old, but by the middle of the book I found Jack to be so annoying that I couldn't muster up any more sympathy for him. None of the characters came across as realistic or having much depth and I believe its because of the voice of the narrator. I'm a home schooling mom of 4 and being one I know the huge advantages that children acquire in their language and math skills getting that one on one interaction, however a 5 year old is still a 5 year old regardless of advanced language and math skills. I currently have a 5 year old and yes he can name more dinosaurs and where they were discovered then the above average adult, but do I think he could hold his little body still long enough to convincingly play dead?? Hell NO!<br />And then there is the complete unrealistic dynamic between Ma and Old Nick that completely throw this book off. She is so fragile and scared of Old Nick and he is violent enough to choke her when the mood hits him to prove dominance, but she manages to set up fierce boundaries between him and Jack? Really? It's little things like that through out the novel that just make it more and more absurd to be believable. I'll stop there because to get into how ridiculous their \\"great escape\\" was would be a major spoiler and a topic that may make you want to to bang your head into the wall.<br />There are many other things about this book that just don't work for me but why hash out every last detail when the easiest thing to say would be that in the end this book did not live up to the hype.

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|We are savoring every episode, since there are only 14 of them (plus the follow-up feature length movie, [[ASIN:B004ZJZPXO Serenity]]).<br /><br />Clever and funny, it is a superb homage to multiple iconic memes. Think: \\"Deawood\\" (without the sex and cursing) meets \\"Star Wars\\" meets \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" meets \\"The Wild Wild West\\" (the good, original TV series).<br /><br />The ensemble cast provides a blended family of nine travelers on a series of marginally legal inter-planetary hauling missions. Led by a Captain Malcolm Reynolds (a former fighter in the losing fight against the current government) they are regularly confronted by malevolent government forces (the remnants of the USA and China, who consolidate their power), uber-zombies (\\"Reavers\\") with a most distasteful three-part approach to disposing of regular humans and various criminals spread among the terraformed planets and moons of a post-apocalyptic universe.<br /><br />Engaging dialogue (that includes sudden and natural injections of Chinese), dark and slapstick humor, suspense and intrigue as the late 19th century American west meets the future in space.<br /><br />If you're don't appreciate the best of either westerns or sci-fi, you might not like it.

B003WUYOQ6|2.0|In engineering, there a problem-solving technique called \\"5 whys\\". If you have a problem, you don't just ask why and answer that question, you go 5 levels deeper. In health matters, more levels would be great, but here we go just one level deeper that common sense.<br /><br />This book starts by criticizing the popular answer to 'why we get fat' - namely that we get fat because we consume more calories than we spend. The author say it's certainly true, but it's not particularly useful in practice, because neither diet nor exercise work too well in the long run, and because explicitly counting calories is near to impossible. There surely must be very accurate weight regulation mechanism, and it just gets broken sometimes. So, the book proceeds to second \\"why\\" - why the regulation mechanism malfunctions.<br /><br />It is claimed that insulin is the reason. It rises when we eat carbohydrates and causes fat and excess carbohydrates to be stored into fat cells. It drops when there are no more carbohydrates to use, and that switches the body to using stored fat. Seems straight-forward. And then it is said that the more carbohydrates we eat, the more fat we accumulate in the long run. The explanation makes little sense. Sure, if I eat more than I immediately need, extra energy is either stored or discarded. If insulin is a mechanism for storing extra energy, then blaming it for helping to store  that energy makes no sense. If the body generates more insulin that is necessary, then why? That question is never answered. There is some discussion of insulin resistance, but rather superficial, too. If we accept that insulin is the right answer for the second why, no next question is asked.<br /><br />But insulin might not even be the right answer. Just typing \\"insulin and obesity\\" into Google finds sources that claim the link is not proven at all. For example, one source say that for Pima people, used in the book as example of very obese in general, high insulin predicts less fat, not more. The book, however, is very certain on its claims, and never mentions any research that might contradict that.<br /><br />To summarize, this is one-sided and not too deep discussion.at, not more.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I have always been a fan of classic rock--I still play my Strawberry Alarm Clock, Journey (with original lead singer Arnal Pinata), Foreigner and Jefferson Starship albums with all the enthusiasm of a black voter voting for Obama. That's why I almost fell out of my chair and did a double take when I heard that Led Zeppelin was going to be making some money by selling the songs off of their December 10, 2007, concert in honor of that Turkish dude who started Atlantic Records! I agree that this concert's songs are probably the best-sounding Zepp songs of any decade, and that just goes to show you that it really takes the death of a music executive to bring out the best from a band of baby boomers, whom I love with all my heart and soul (Hello, Jimmy!).<br /><br />All the awesome Zepp songs are here that any true, hardcore Zepp fan should know and love with all of his heart and soul, although they are so well-known by now that even people who don't like Zepp probably know these songs from the zillion commercials that have used them. I really dig the live performance of Stairway to Heaven because it inspires me to get high, and I still think Kashmir is the best Zepp song of all time because India and Pakistan are looking ready right now to get into a war again, especially as the Obama administration's foreign policy appears to be totally overwhelmed by their Benghazi, Libya scandal at the moment!<br /><br />I loved watching this concert and hearing the original Zepp members play, especially when Jimmy Page plays his guitar so that it goes wang-wang-wang. I absolutely love it when Page makes his guitar choke out those awesome guitar effects, almost as much as I love it when Page makes his guitar make those sweet baerm-baerm-baerm noises. Rawkin! And let's not forget about Bobby Plant: I just can't get enough of his stunning vocals, such as when he makes his voice go aoooga-aoooga, and especially when he lets out some whoop-whoop noises while singing songs like No Quarter and Dazed and Confused.<br /><br />While my review up to this point has been 99.9% positive, I can't be totally up on Zepp. After all, they still have so much to learn, especially when you consider that the music from this concert was recorded when they hadn't played together as a band in a long time, therefore resulting in some stage ineptitude. I suggest that Zepp take some cues from probably the best live musician/real artist/hardcore entertainer today, Justin Bieber, and learn how to really dazzle the crowd. I suggest that, for Zepp's next live performance, they include some backup dancers, a black drummer, some pyrotechnics, tricks like Page and Plant descending from the rafters via wires, the band members doing some backflips, and, of course, the band members inviting some tween girl fans onstage to serenade them with sweet songs like Since I've Been L***** You.and Dazed and Confused.<br /><br />While my review up to this point has been 99.9% positive, I can't be totally up on Zepp. After all, they still have so much to learn, especially when you consider that the music from this concert was recorded when they hadn't played together as a band in a long time, therefore resulting in some stage ineptitude.

Anywho, that ain't important; what's important is that Rebel Soul proves that Kid Rock is not just a great rapper, but even a greater rock n' roller.<br /><br />I am particularly fond of Kid Rock because he is totally the opposite of all those e/v/i/l, lib artists who love to worship B/a/r/a/ck Obama and support causes like a/b/o/r/t/i/on and wealth redistribution. Just look at the titles of the songs on this CD to verify that Kid Rock is indeed the conservative musician to end all conservative musicians. His song, C/h/i/c/k/e/ns in the Pen, is clearly a reference to small government! His other song, R/e/d/n/e/ck Paradise, is clearly a love song to the conservative culture of the red states, where people tote g/u/n/s, worship Jesus and vote GOP. I mean, just listen to the overuse of fiddles, violins and banjos in that ditty. Sooie!!<br /><br />Man, am I glad that Mitt Romney won and is now the president of the U.S. In my mind, that validates my purchase of Kid Rock's Rebel Soul because at least I am giving my money to a real, patriotic American bad/a/s/s and not some Obama-worshipping 47-percenter.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|At first, I have to admit that I did not like Kelly Clarkson as much as undoubtedly the greatest singer to emerge from American Idol, which would either be Justin Guarini or that Sanjaya female. However, since her support of libertarian Ron Paul last year--which includes support of positions such as abandoning Israel and smoking more dope--I have become probably the world's greatest Kelly Clarkson fanboy because I think that what makes a songstress really excellent is when she starts to politicize her music!!<br /><br />I want to be especially respectful to Ms. Clarkson here, but it may be a bit premature for a Greatest Hits CD, no? I mean, sure her immortal and highly intelligent songs like My Life Would Suck Without You and Catch my Breat (sic) catapult her to diva royalty that eclipses even the late, okay Whitney Houston, but maybe she should wait until one of her songs actually becomes the theme of a WWE event before she puts out a Greatest Hits collection! Who's with me on that, huh?! I knew it!<br /><br />Still, I bought this CD because a lot of its songs are inarguably some of the greatest contributions to American music since Elvis Presley shook his hips and curled his lip. I mean, I can't even begin to excitably tell you how many times Behind Those Hazel Eyes got me through many long, torturous hours of doing homework. Similarly, I can't even express to you how Since U Been Gone steeled me through absolutely hellish times in my life, such as when my pet goldfish died, and I had to flush his a/s/s down the toilet because he started to smell.<br /><br />Clearly, it goes without saying, now that I have briefly thought it over, that Ms. Clarkson has indeed put out an impregnably solid body of musical work that totally justifies this Greatest Hits CD. In fact, thinking about this whole issue even a little bit harder and longer, I am starting to get really, really furious that her evil, probably un-libertarian, record label refused to put out a Greatest Hits CD sooner than today! How dare they! Clearly, Ms. Clarkson deserved to put out a Greatest Hits CD from the first second that she was named Ms. American Idol 10 years ago. Sheesh!ooner than today! How dare they! Clearly, Ms. Clarkson deserved to put out a Greatest Hits CD from the first second that she was named Ms. American Idol 10 years ago. Sheesh!

B008BD9SI8|5.0|The Clint Eastwood classics The Unforgiven and Pale Rider, combined with wagon trains, mining town saloons and the usual hacking and slashing of Joe Abercrombie make this book a lot of fun. All the characters from the First Law books moving in and out of the story gave it context without which I doubt it would stand alone. If you have read the earlier books, you will really enjoy this one- if you havent, go and start with them first.<br /><br />Not the best of the series- but still very good. Riding off into the sunset as a finale? I laughed out loud.<br /><br />Loved it.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Something of a prequel to Alien.  Interesting, but sketchily composed, premise.  Would have been more \\"believable\\" had the crew behaved more like the scientists they were supposed to be rather than like a bunch a idiot teenagers (no offense to teenagers).  A more carefully written script could have easily accomplished the story progressions while still adhering to general scientific protocols, which would have made for a much better movie.

I love that it looks as though it were typed<br />on an old typewriter and taped together in places....just like a &#34;well-loved&#34; recipe from your grandmothers file box. Katie uses simple, healthy ingredients in ways that elevate them to the level of mouthwatering, delightful experiences.  I particularly applaude her use of nuts and seeds in salads and main dishes.  Excellent flavor  and texture blending!  And the photos simply take my breath away!  Congratulations!  This book is such a fun experience.

0553593544|1.0|Just couldn't go through with it. I hate it when I read through 300 pages and just cant bear to read on.<br /><br />Since we know that the basic premise of the book is based around Bourne losing his memory, What was really annoying about this book was that each and every twist, turn, introduction of a new locale or character, is credited to his 'intuition', 'gut feel', or 'sudden flashes', which is alright the first few times, but then his intuition and gut, pretty much takes the whole story forward.<br /><br />It's established that Jason Bourne is an expert, but it seems to me that he's an expert at nothing else but exploiting his 'gut feeling'. There is no intellect or logic behind any if his actions. Hes just a pair of well trained arms with a huge gut feel. If anyone, I thought his accomplice was a more interesting character than Jason Bourne who's just one big 'DUMBO' with a gun.<br /><br />The plot was very slow, superfluously detailed and really boring in parts.<br /><br />I picked this book up cause I really enjoyed the movies, and I was looking to get a deeper dive in the world of espionage and thrill, but disappointed.<br /><br />I would recommend some good Nelson Demille books instead of this drag.

The acting was brilliant and the video quality on blue ray was fantastic with all the colors. Liked it so much that I'm buying it...
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Critics call this movie unpatriotic or Anti-Christian.<br /><br />This is the story of a Totalitarian Society. One where the Government can Black List anything. Where every career is a pawn of the regime. Where the regime can enter homes without cause or warrant. Where citizens can be imprisoned or executed at the whim of it's dictator.<br /><br />V was captured and experimented on by that regime. Those experiments erased his memory and enhanced his physical speed and reflexes. Those experiments also created Bio Weapons that let the regime enslave V's country. After escaping V spent the next few decades planning and executing his revenge - his revolution against that regime. V was fighting to free his country. Nothing could be more Patriotic.<br /><br />That regime destroyed most religions. What it did to Christianity was even worse. It reduced the Church to a Political Puppet, a farce of the Church, a Mockery of all Christ was. It even turned the Cross into a Symbol of it's political power, instead of a sign of Christ's sacrifice. Those who see Anti-Christianity in this are right. V was fighting it.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a masterpiece for all to love.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is such a lovely book.  It is a very nice ride through the history of a young girl coming to life as a flawed adult learning that we all have the ability to change and regardless of what difficulties life throws our way, we can always find happiness. The first step is accepting your own flaws.  It was a very nice read.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I like pretty much everything Kid Rock has ever done, he's an artist that always evolves and here on \\"Rebel Soul\\" he continues to slide from genre to genre with great success.  Kid Rock on \\"Rebel Soul\\" is less rapper and more Bob Seger, an influence that is hard to miss on Kid's latest works.  Overall the songwriting is good here and moves from a bit of country twang to some hard hitting horns for some Detroit soul.<br /><br />While there is still some use of the auto-tune showing up here, Kid is more and more showing off his vocal chops here as a singer.  He may not have the best range, but he makes great use of what he has.  I really did find myself picking up bits of Seger and James Brown throughout the disc.<br /><br />The second song on the disc is \\"Let's Ride,\\" a song that is heavily in support of the brave men and women of the armed services.  Kid does them proud here with a song that rocks hard and carries a heavy meaning.  This song alone is worth the price of the album.<br /><br />I also have to admit that it's nice getting an album like this from a guy that is on the conservative side of the aisle willing to talk about how the government is trying to bring us to a \\"one world nation.\\"  If the kids would only listen to Kid before it's too late!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun album with Kid Rock showing off his songwriting and genre melding music.  Highly recommended!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is the best version as it doesn't, have all the advertisment or digital copy which is useless.This is also the best value $$$$$
B004LWZWGA|4.0|This is a very good movie. All of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies have been not just really great comic book movies, they have been really good movies in general, discussing subjects like crime, definitions of justice and heroism, and the nature Batman and (in some cases more importantly) his villains. Batman Begins was a really good movie, and The Dark Knight was such a great movie that it was almost perfect, both as a Batman movie and as an adult crime drama. From the increase in quality between the first two movies, you would expect that the final Nolan movie would be the greatest of them all, building upon the first two movies and bringing it all to a satisfying conclusion in a really grand, climactic fashion, and while this is a very good movie, it doesn't really reach any of its goals. As good as it is, it unfortunately has a few problems that drag it down a bit. Firstly, the hand-to-hand fight scenes are, for the most part, pretty lackluster and boring considering that Batman is supposed to be one of the most highly trained martial artists in the world. Never even got the tiniest sense of that in any of Nolan's movies: the fights are shot too close, the costumes make movement next to impossible, and the editing is so choppy that it is hard to follow. Secondly, I get the impression that Nolan is taking too much advantage of how well known the source material is and not explaining several small but important plot points in the movie: How did Batman get out of whatever country that prison was in so quickly? How did he get back into Gotham without anyone noticing? How did Batman recover from a BROKEN SPINE in a matter of weeks?! I have other questions but they get in to heavy spoiler territory which I am trying to avoid. Some of these are probably at least partially a result of Cristopher Nolan trying too hard to appeal to the fans by setting up situations from well-known Batman stories (Knightfall, No Man's Land, Dark Knight Returns, etc.) when in the context of this movie they don't really help the narrative flow properly. Finally, the ending was not quite as climactic as I was hoping for. Not enough action, and a little too much predictability in the story progression. Finally, this is the worst the Christian Bale Batman voice has ever been. It's over the top, ridiculous, and it makes it really hard to understand what he's saying. Last two are minor complaints overall. But, with all of that said, there is still a lot to like in this movie. Anne Hatheway is a great Catwoman, and Tom Hardy is a really intimidating presence as Bane. The action scenes that are light on fist fighting are pretty damn awesome, and the Batplane is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Like I said, it's a very very GOOD Batman movie, but seeing as its a follow-up to THE DARK KNIGHT, I was just expecting a little bit more. Still, I can easily recommend this for purchase because it's still a Cristopher Nolan Batman movie, and it's the last one we're gonna get.

B000O599ZS|5.0|Yes, this movie deals with the racism of Native Americans, but me as a Native American do not see this as too offensive. If you are familiar with John Ford you would also have seen \\"Cheyenne Autumn\\" which shows a bit more on the director's view. This movie (to me) is a treasure. This movie is not just about the racism of Native Americans but also it shows how the spirit of someone will not stop. Really I understand how some might not \\"get\\" this movie, but you have to have an open mind, and a love for westerns.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I have liked the last three MI movies.  (The first portrayed Jim Phelps as a villain -- horrible idea.)  However, the action has superceded the plot and character development.  I looked forward every Sunday night to a new episode of Mission Impossible in the late 60s because there were always twists and turns that were rarely predictable.  In the MI movies, it's all stunts and high-tech, no real insight into the people involved.  Plus the iconic music (not just the theme, but the incidental music too) has been relegated to a supporting role, where in the TV series it was almost another character and drove the story forward.  I think the tightness of the hour format on TV forced the writers to curtail extravagance and focus on plot; a two-hour-plus film doesn't have that leanness.  Maybe Mission Impossible 5 should be written as a serial -- 15-minute installments with cliffhanger endings, 10 episodes in all.  I'd definitely go to see that.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I have spent the weekend with this box set- played all 32 sides of my vinyl and carefully looked over the book and the liner notes while I listened.  This review is written by someone who has actually fully experienced this product.<br /><br />First, I am disappointed with reviewers who are commenting on this box set without having listened to it.  Insofar as criticizing where the masters were sourced from, I think the producers have been very forthcoming with these details and it's not fair to slam the product when no attempt was made to misrepresent it in the first place.<br /><br />Second, I'm sorry to hear there are bad pressings out there- I have gotten vinyl before which is muddy and distorted or where the spindle hole is so badly off center the music is severely garbled by the time you get a few minutes into the record.  I know very well bad vinyl from the 21st century when I see it and I'm not surprised to hear the issue appears to have struck yet again.  That is very disappointing to hear, but unfortunately it happens so frequently I have come to expect it and I understood the risk when I bought this box set expecting there might be a good chance I would be sending it back to Amazon.<br /><br />After spending so much time with the box set and reading some negative reviews, I wanted to say all 32 sides of my vinyl sound really great and if you're thinking of buying this you might be encouraged to hear that someone else out there has very nice sounding pressings which is why I felt compelled to share this experience.  I did not have any scratched or scuffed up vinyl and the music never sounded muddy or distorted even towards the center of vinyl (as often occurs especially on vocals) even though there were 32 chances for this to happen (and I was nervously awaiting it happening too after reading some bad reviews).  I'm very happy with the sound of all 32 sides!  This box set is AWESOME and it sounds really great.<br /><br />Lastly, I do want to say Amazon dida poor job packing this.  It was in a box with bubble tape, but the bubble tape was only on one side of the box set leaving the other side only protected by the cardboard shipping box.  Boo!  Amazon has been doing a much better job with packaging LPs lately compared to a few years back, but at least for me they didn't do a great job packaging this box set.  Fortunately, my box set didn't get damaged perhaps in part because the manufacturers inserted styrofoam inserts into the box to protect the records which was a nice touch.
0374214913|5.0|I took this book with me on vacation to Mexico where I had no access to internet or iPhones for 2 weeks!  It was a lot of fun reading about Google on the beaches of Mexico, and getting a chuckle from reading the quirky office-work descriptions.  Quite fun to read!  And an enjoyable ending, especially the epilogue.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I guess I read this book on a more superficial level.  I read some of the reviews of the book and didn't get the same impression.  But, I guess that's what is so great about the book.  It's what you personally take away.  The last chapter with it's parallel stories makes you realize more about the book and it's meaning than you get in the other99 chapters.  The story starts slow then you read to see what happens next and then you get to the end and wow.

B005LAII1C|3.0|Without going into the plot of the movie too much this is the one about the naughty teddy bear who comes to life. The previews of this movie stuck in my mind and my husband and I were both excited to see it. The intro of the movie starts out very funny and sets up the story well, but that's kinda where it stops. The middle and end of the film was ok but not very memorable with only a couple laughs that come to mind. We were both rather disappointed with the film overall because the previews and the possibilities of comedy with the story line is endless and they seemed to just produce a mediocre comedy. I would probably watch this one again on a Netflix stream or TV replay but would not pay for a rental of this one. 3 out of 5 starts.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story of Peeta and Katniss continues. As victors of the Hunger Games, Peeta and Katniss have certain obligations to fulfill, but nothing prepares them for what their actions have unleashed. This is just as good as the first.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Vulgar, crude and virtually without any meaningful dialog, this would be a typical summer movie if it wasn't for Chloe Grace Moretz, the ten year old Hit Girl with a mouth that would embarrass a sailor.  A teenage boy (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) decides to combat rampant crime in his city by becoming a comic book style hero he names Kick Ass.  With a scuba suit and two police batons sets out to fight crime and right wrongs.  Predictably, he gets the stuffing kicked out of him every night until he is mentored by purple haired Hit Girl (Chloe Grace) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage).  An apparent competitor in the hero game, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), uses Kick Ass to lure Big Daddy into an ambush.  Nicholas Cage is Nicholas Cage: Taylor-Johnson and Mintz-Plasse are so-so but Chloe Grace Moretz clearly displays an acting talent that will propel her to starring in the remake of Carrie only three years later.  The movie works as a story about courage but it didn't have to be so gross.  BTW, did you know that Chloe Grace Moretz has starred in four movies she is not, as of this writing, old enough to see (rated R)?

B009NQKXYK|3.0|If you are looking for the complete back story to Aliens, this might not be it.  I thought there were too many inconsistencies in the story that didn't account for the observations and artifacts in Aliens.  The result is way short of any kind of interesting treaties on immortality and the origin of species and just becomes a rather predictable bang-bang shoot 'em up.  Probably won't see it again and certainly won't buy it.
0446580848|4.0|The story was excellent and built to a thrilling ending.  However sometimes it seemed to &#34;drag&#34; a bit in the mddle.  If John Corey were a real person that I knew I'd say that he seems like he may be ready for retirement.  But I don't want John to retire. His humor (which is really Nelson to a &#34;T&#34;) is what makes these stories possible for me to read.  Without the witty comments by John Corey I couldn't handle the gore, the killing.<br />Nelson DeMille is my favortie author.  He seems like a regular guy when I read emails from him.  But then he sits down and pens a story so complex, so filled with intrigue, and I marvel at his skill in writing.<br />Can't wait for the next book, which I wouldn't be surprised if it were a sequel to &#34;The Panther.&#34;

B007IXWL2C|4.0|This last installment of the Fifty Shades Trilogy was by far the best. It was still filled with kinky sex on every other page (which believe it or not can eventually get boring), but there was finally suspense.  I'm not impressed as others were with the triology, however I would say it is overall a great read.
B004OR199G|3.0|A great book does not need expletives! I hate the language, There is mind pollution as well as body pollution. Clean mind clean body clean heart!
0345803493|4.0|Unlike the 1st book, which I found slow and almost downright boring, this installment had more to it.  Because it held my interest, I was able to read this book in a couple of days vs the two weeks it took for me to read the 1st one.  You are given more of an insight to the mysterious Christian Grey.  Ana is becoming more comfortable with herself, thus making her more comfortable in Christian's world.  There were some events I did not expect to happen.  Therefore, I do recommend this book.
B00843TZJM|5.0|If you like CSN, you will like this. Audio is good as well as is the video. Won't be disapointed!
B009H442DG|5.0|Yes,this is Olivia's fourth Christmas cd.I have every single one of them. I love them in its own unique packaging and songs with Olivia's ethereal and warm vocals in them.No complaints here.'This Christmas' is different because we get Olivia in a different setting in recording these beautiful songs with one of her best pals,John Travolta.For people who grew up with 'Grease', this is a nice follow-up to celebrate the festive season with two familiar stars into our household.Sure,it  has has been 29 years since Olivia and John had paired in a project namely  'Two of A Kind'  with the beautiful duet 'Take A Chance' from the movie soundtrack.Now,'I Think You Might Like it',one of the songs in this new cd,will hearten us to a nice, warm atmosphere with loved ones and friends in our cozy homes during such a season of giving and loving.Kudos to Olivia and John.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|TL;DR version: This was a great set of books. The author did a great job of developing the characters and their world. The story line really drew me in to the world of the silo(s).<br /><br />The last author I read where I was left wanting to read all of the rest of his works was China Mieville.  Hugh Howey now joins that list.<br /><br />Longer version:<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where mankind is driven to live underground in silos rather than on the surface of the earth. The worst crime a person can commit is to desire to leave the silo. The punishment for that crime is to get what they want. They get to leave the silo and go to the uninhabitable surface. While there, before they die, they are to clean the lenses that give the inhabitants of the silo their only view of the outside world. Everyone claims that they won't do it, yet once out there, they all do. No one knows why. They all do the cleaning, however. That is until...<br /><br />I am reading the omnibus edition, which means that it is all 5 of the Wool books in one. Rather than review the story as a whole, I will go book by book.<br /><br />Wool - This is the shortest of the books, and was obviously written more as a short story than anything else. As a short story, it works very well. Hugh Howey does an excellent job setting up the world in which this story takes place, and the characters within it. He gives us just enough of a glimpse of the world get get us curious about it, and just enough back story on the main characters to get us to actually know them without making the story too long. We are introduced to the concept of the silo, the ritual of cleaning, and we get a glimpse as to why the condemned cleaners actually go through with the cleaning. The story is gripping and has balance.<br /><br />Wool 2 - The hunt for a new sheriff. Now the short story is starting to evolve into a more intricate novel. The second book on its owns is not the most interesting. It is more a touching love story than anything else. However, it does a wonderful job of further setting up the culture of the silo. The different working classes on the various levels, the interaction between the different classes of people, the social taboos and religious beliefs. Some of this was touched on in the first book, but it is fully developed here.<br /><br />On its own, this book is somewhat dull. As part of the omnibus, however, it does a wonderful job of doing what it does, which is setting up the story for book #3.<br /><br />Wool 3 - The new sheriff is in power, but she doesn't really know what her job is. She is a mechanic, after all, from the lower levels, and life on the upper levels is confusing. The political structure has become difficult as well, due to recent events. Some of the plots points that were begun in Wool 2 start to gel in this book. Here we get our first glimpse into the true purpose of IT, and into what may exist outside of the silo.<br /><br />Wool 4 - Now things really start to get good. Things are starting to unravel as we follow three separate story lines. The IT department is preparing for war, mechanical and supply are preparing to start an uprising, and Jules has discovered something very interesting about her world since being sent out for cleaning and disappearing over the hill.<br /><br />Wool 5 - Jules and Solo continue to try and dry out the lower levels of silo 17. Back in silo 18, the war between IT and Mechanical is not going well and threatens to destroy the whole silo (just like happened to silo 17 years ago). Lukas is getting into trouble with some of the questions he keeps asking. If he just keeps his mouth shut, he can become the next head of IT, but he just can't. He has too many questions. Questions that he knows will lead him to cleaning. Will Lukas go out to cleaning? Will Jules manage to get back to silo 18? What will happen if she does? You will have to read the books to find out... :)
B007SGM084|5.0|This series has gotten so much publicity that I was not sure what to think. 2 of my cousins recommended it, and I was glad I purchased it. E L James has her own writing style, she is soulful, honest, touching and her descriptions are very intimate and real. I enjoyed immensely these 3 books. Read for yourself and see what all the hype is about, you will NOT be disappointed.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|jjceo! Your reviews are always very helpful and right on with my thinking! I can make up my own mind but it sure helps to have the layout you provide as I choose whether or not to download the faotd! Just wanted to give you a heads up and say Thanks! As for this game&hellip;it's a no-brainer...forget about it; I suck at these games but I will try them anyway depending on the reviews. sure looks fun tho!!! The rating is from my son who happens to be very good at it!
B009P5S11G|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, Rihanna's strongest album. It brought back the amazing edge that Rated R had back in 2009. I always liked Rihanna, but Rated R made me an undeniable fan. I loved Loud and Talk That Talk as they were both great in their own way, but I was longing for her to take a risk and bring back that edge and creativity from Rated R.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE unapologetic! There is so much diversity on this album: great ballads (Stay, What Now, Love without Tragedy/Mother Mary, Half of me), fresh grinding beats that will have you lose yourself in them (Phresh out the Runway, Numb, Pour it Up, Jump), an addictive sound that reminded me of 90's European pop (Nobody's Business), the obvious club hit (Right Now - it doesn't get more David Guetta than that), powerful ballads with an edgy beat (Diamonds, Lost in Paradise) and an amazing island-flavored reggae song (No Love Allowed). The only track I'm not a fan of on this album is Get it Over with, it just seems like a filler song.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album undeniably shows how much Rihanna has grown sonically and vocally. I saw her on tour and she has an incredible presence on stage, but I am especially amazed at the creativity she puts into her work and the risks she is willing to take sonically. This is especially true of this album, and she definitely did an amazing job on it. Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S. The deluxe version of the cd also includes two decent remixes of Diamonds (I am not a huge fan of remixes though) as well as a 20 minute preview of the Loud Tour dvd.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game on my Kindle Fire. Larger tablet maps are challenging but are an excellent way to kill lots of time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books because she delves into the characters, starting out slowly, and then it becomes a mystery with an interesting ending.
B00979CS50|5.0|I played this CD for my buds last week, during our monthly gathering of playing pool. Thumbs up by all. Best Neil Young and Crazy Horse in Decades! The grandfather of grunge rock has delivered. Rock and Roll will never die.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle's latest album showcases her talent nicely; she is a consummate performer all throughout this album. Indeed, there's not a bad track in the lot; and that's grand. Susan's voice is in excellent form here and you can tell just by listening that she sings from her heart--I love that. Susan's sophisticated phrasing, her keen sense of timing and her excellent diction enhance her performance all the more. The quality of the sound is also very good.<br /><br />\\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" has Susan effortlessly making that octave jump at the beginning between \\"Some\\" and \\"where;\\" and the piano arrangement couldn't have been any better. \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" is a song I first heard performed by Abba; and they would surely be pleased with Susan's interpretation of this ballad! \\"Send in the Clowns\\" from the musical \\"A Little Night Music\\" has Susan squarely front and center and \\"The Music of the Night\\" has \\"The Phantom\\" himself (from \\"Phantom of the Opera\\") Michael Crawford doing a fantastic duet with Susan; this is a major highlight of the track set! \\"Bring Him Home\\" is done very well while \\"Memory\\" from the show \\"Cats\\" shines bright in Susan's more than capable hands; I really like \\"Memory.\\"<br /><br />\\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" from \\"Oliver\\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Susan Boyle who sings this to perfection--and beyond! \\"All I Ask of You\\" features Donny Osmond and together with Susan they do a sublime duet on \\"All I Ask of You.\\" \\"Out Here on My Own\\" from \\"Fame\\" is heartfelt and Susan does a great job on \\"You'll Never Walk Alone.\\" \\"This Is the Moment\\" also features Susan doing a duet with Donny Osmond and they never let go of a superfluous note! I'm very impressed.<br /><br />This CD is an absolute must-have for Susan Boyle's fans; and people who enjoy classic songs from shows and even movies will not be disappointed. Susan Boyle never sounded better; and I highly recommend this music.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was not like anything i've ever read before. Very , very explicit.Wasn't what I thought it was.But I ended up feeling sorry for Christen and what he'd been through.Really messed him up being with that sick older woman. Had a happy ending though.

B004LWZW7O|4.0|I honestly don't know why this has such bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent movie. Very exciting and kept you entertained the whole time. Just see it, it won't be a waste of your time, like some movies.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Many reviewers talk about how it harkens back to the 60's and 70's and compare him to Dylan. I can't see how it is possible to place the lyrics at any time period. I think the difficulty figuring out where he was from in the movie shows how removed from any time or place his lyrics are. It may be that people that do not listen to a wide variety of music hear the music as retro and place it in the past because of that but to me it makes more sense to compare him to someone like TS Eliot or Buddha than Dylan. There are lines in his songs that many songwriters would figure they could retire after they had written they are so perfect.  He has whole songs of such lines like \\"I saw my reflection in the tears of my father's dying eyes.\\" Plus, his melodies are infectious and pleasing and every song is hoping that it will make you a better person by hearing it. It is probably better not to compare him to anyone or to describe him by saying he is of a time period or place and just let him sing to you and see what happens.  I have about 8000 CDs and this one is far beyond anything I even imagined.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I bought the first two seasons and just recently bought the third. I'm thrilled with all three purchases. Packaged well, no scratches on the discs, well protected, and priced right. I would buy again from this seller. As for The Good Wife -- in my opinion, it's the best show on TV.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is very well written and keeps you turning the pages<br />in suspense.  The characters are well developed.  This has been<br />a great read.<br /><br />Will be looking for more books by this author.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Alabama Shakes:  \\"Boys and Girls\\".  Very nice album.  Very semi bluesy.  Reminescent of Janis Joplin's music.  Can't go wrong with this.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|What I have enjoyed most about Evernote is the ability to share info with my husband.  If I remember we need groceries, I can create a quick list and send this to him. He then has it and can stop on his way home from work.
B000L3CHC0|2.0|Great watch, until after 4 years it started to last only about 8 months on a battery.<br />Had it diagnosed by the Tissot service centre in South Africa (swatch group).<br />Cost of service (sounds like they replace the movement), same as what I paid for the watch...<br />Nobody there can give me an estimation of how long the watch should last between services.<br />I thus have to assume it will again only last 4 years.<br />Servicing it every 4 years I may as well do the consumerism thing, throw it in the bin and buy something else.<br />Being a supposedly good swiss made watch I was hoping for it to last a bit more than 4 years - even though it is an affordable one.<br />Or am I expecting too much?
B009A9EPLM|4.0|Once again the happy collaboration (40th,they say) between director Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams has resulted in something quite memorable.  Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" is simply one of his best efforts (can we ever again think of Abe Lincoln as Raymond Massey or Henry Fonda after Daniel Day-Lewis) and one of the great motion pictures of the year; and Williams' score is a perfect fit for the last full measure of Lincoln's life.  The score is somber, solemn, loving and introspective without being maudlin (and let's avoid use of the word \\"melancholy\\") and pure Americana without bombast or cliché, and echoes now and again of Aaron Copland's \\"Lincoln Portrait\\" (probably by intent).  There are also moments that playfully recall frontier roots and the amiable nature of quite honestly the greatest President in the history of the republic.  It is also a nice touch that Williams conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.  This is one of the finest film scores of the year, on the screen and on this album, for an equally fine film.  Solid production values and nice packaging by Sony.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham moves away from his formulaic approach to writing and produces a really clever, thought provoking novel. I had just abut given up on his novels, but a friend recommended this one and it was a good recommendation.

1416583432|5.0|My parents are total dog loving freaks. In the best way possible. I gav ethis book to them for the holidays, and they both enjoyed it, It is a quick, fun little read, nothing to heady but still educational.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I know that this is the unofficial prequel to Alien, but it is just as good as those movies.  I love all of the special features to this film.  It is a great film for a great price on Amazon.
0757302661|3.0|So many women swear by this book, so I'm giving it a 4-star rating. In fact, basically everyone I know who had a natural birth considers this to be the bible for natural and home births.<br /><br />For me, however, it was boring, repetitive and trite. Downright preachy and sometimes cocky. Basically implying that if you can't get on board with the program, then something is wrong with you. And that tone, I frankly found offensive.<br /><br />If you are someone who can meditate, then this book will help you take the skills you already have and apply them to childbirth.<br /><br />If you are someone who can't, then really just forget it. Trying to learn how to meditate, and to meditate so deeply, seems like a really difficult task to undertake, perhaps impossible, especially if you have 10 months, assuming you started reading it the very day you got pregnant. It will frustrate you to no end, make you feel inadequate, scare you about your upcoming birth experience, and be a total waste.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Why are people complaining about paying $5 for this game? Is $5 really worth whining about when the average console game is about $50? I'm not being mean but seriously, its not worth crying about. The game is incredible, trust me.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|An amazing movie made even more amazing when watched in 3D. I've watched numerous 3D movies that were good, but this was great. Very long movie so we took several breaks, give our eyes a chance to wake up. The effects were top notch and beautiful. The world of Pandora must be watched in 3D to be fully appreciated. Well worthy of the cost.<br /><br />Only regret is the disc has no extras at all. I understand the price is for the 3D, but insteadof aan additional disc with the movie in 2D I'd of rather gotten an extras disc. Small complaint as I'd of probably watched the making of only once, but will watch the feature several times anytime anyone wants to see it while visiting.

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I was impressed with Phillips music since his Idol audition. My goodness this young man is a musician, he stuck to his style with this new album. On the 4th listen since 9 this morning. I love Get up Get down, such a fun song. Well worth the buying this album
1451638647|5.0|Enjoyable as usual. Though I missed Miles. I especially missed the fact Bujold seems to have lost Miles, especially first person Miles. But since she seems to think marriage and kids have left Miles boring, it was nice to have a story about Ivan.<br /><br />My only complaint is that all the other books show Ivan as pretty much an idiot. Suddenly he's not. He's not Miles either, but a bright enough man.<br /><br />Still it was nice to see everyone. It was like a visit home and finding out the cousin everyone worried about has finally grown up.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|There is a reason why so many people say that National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is at the top of their list of Christmas comedies. First of all, it is hilarious -- totally, truly hilarious! Without a doubt, it is the best of all the National Lampoon Vacation movies of all time, and that is saying a lot. It moves from one classic scene to another. By the time you've all stopped howling at one scene, you are laughing at the next. You may find yourself having to rewind because you miss so much.<br /><br />If you already own National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, order copies for friends. It's the absolutely perfect gift for comedy lovers, guaranteed!
B009AZZEU2|3.0|It's nice to see so many fans of Soundgarden enthusiastic about this album.  As a long-time fan of the band, I can understand the excitement surrounding the band's return.  The 4- and 5-star reviews reflect the fans' thrill over the comeback of one of rock's greatest bands at a time when popular music stinks on ice.<br /><br />There's just one small problem.  The album just isn't that good.<br /><br />I've listened to it many times and come to the sad conclusion that it falls seriously short of expectations.  The problem is primarily with the writing - the songs just aren't interesting or memorable.  \\"Been Away Too Long\\" starts the album off with some energy but fails to engage.  The album's best song, \\"Non-State Actor,\\" follows and it's everything we love about Soundgarden: relentless, driving, furious.  But the mood isn't sustained.  \\"By Crooked Steps,\\" \\"A Thousand Days Before,\\" \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" and \\"Bones of Birds\\" fail to make much of an impression.  They're OK, but OK isn't good enough for the band that wrote \\"Outshined\\" and \\"My Wave.\\"  The middle of the album is actually pretty awful, with the totally forgettable \\"Taree,\\" \\"Attrition\\" and \\"Black Saturday.\\"  The heavily acoustic \\"Halfway There\\" is mildly interesting but again fails to make much of an impression.  The album's second-best song, \\"Worse Dreams,\\" features a soaring chorus that bears resemblance to an actual hook (as opposed to everything that's come before).  The album ends with the flat-out mediocre \\"Eyelids Mouth\\" and \\"Rowing,\\" a song that probably sounded better on paper than in the actual execution.<br /><br />I have to think that all the 4- and 5-star reviews are from fans who are hearing amazing things in the music that, quite frankly, just aren't there.  I get it.  I'm a fan, too.  But sometimes you need to put all that aside and listen objectively.  Compared to their previous work, King Animal just isn't in the same league.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I really thought, Ok this is being written by a neuro-surgeon so it should really convince people about the existence of Heaven.  The author continually stated that what he experienced was difficult to describe, but he never really described it in any detail then.
B005HG4C4C|4.0|I have waited a long while to chime in. I wanted to be certain. But my hope is being renewed in DT.<br /><br />Something happened with this band after 6 degrees.  Its like they ran into a huge almost decade long case of writers block. ToT gave us a decent, but mostly forgettable straight ahead metal album. That whole play Master of Puppets and Number of the Beast live thing seeped into their brains unfortunately.  Octovarium only presaged the descent into what is the worst DT album, Systematic Chaos. Lyrically the band began to lose its grip. Labrie was asked(?) to trade his instrument for ridiculous phrasing and black metal treatments.  Its bad enough that Portnoy wanted to go the death metal vocal route but to ask one of the top 3 vocalist in the progressive metal genre to do the same is either bad judgement or crass commercialism (apparently the kids buy that crap) or worse, both.<br /><br />But then BCSL came out and something had changed.  Yeah the lyrics are putrid but A nightmare to remember, Withered and Count of Tuscany began to remind us that there is a progressive metal band still living inside these guys that can rip the doors off all competition.<br /><br />Then DToE.  It is indeed. Yeah Portnoys gone and I'll leave it to everybody else to debate the loss/gain of Mangini, whatever your opinion.  But to me the biggest most glaring improvement over the last 10 years is that LaBrie is back to form. Heck the whole album is worth having just to hear him jump an octive in Beneath the Surface.  I havent gotten goosebumps like that since 6 degrees.<br /><br />I am hoping that their next album finds Petrucci more refined and restrained, LaBrie continuing to do what he does better than anyone else, and Rudess finally contributing up to the diverse potential that he has (octavarium is forgiven Jordan).  Kudos to Myung, he is the glue that has been consistently stellar throughout the valley and what I trust is a real return to form for what was once the best band in the world.

B005LAIHPE|1.0|Unless you like watching your movies through subtitling, do not purchase this item. It offers several options in subtitles except the one on how to turn them off completely. My viewing was ruined by the subtitling across the bottom of the screen that often took up as much as a third of the picture. Foolish me disposed of the packaging and return label so am stuck with a DVD I will never watch again.

B007REV4YI|5.0|When MGM/UA/Columbia made the decision to reboot one of their most important but faltering franchises with 2006's CASINO ROYALE, James Bond had become vital again. A decidedly more modern storytelling approach to the character with a whole new and edgier Bond (Daniel Craig) in the mix helped to create possibly the best Bond film of all time. It set a new standard that future Bond films would have to live up to. Gone were the super-duper futuristic gadgetry and groan-inducing double entendres and one-liners. Bond was finally ready to exit the realm of self-parody that the series had embraced readily since the Roger Moore days and even more firmly with the last few Pierce Brosnan films, and present us with a much grittier and deadlier, but alternately more human Bond; a Bond more comfortable with the assassin aspects of having a Double-O rating, but carrying with him something deeper behind those icy blue eyes. The series seemed to become more of a character study rather than the usual cavalcade of Bond Girls, cars that turn into submarines, boom boxes that became rocket launchers and massive underground volcano bases. This was now a Bond for the 21st Century. Sadly, the potential for this new direction felt somewhat squandered when it came to Craig's second Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which had the dubious honor of being the only Bond film that was a direct sequel to the previous film. Suddenly, the fact that it was a Bond film felt incidental and it just didn't work. Then the powers that be behind the franchise decided, much to their great benefit, that getting an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, Sam Mendes, to helm their next adventure was a good idea, and this gave us, on the 50th anniversary of Bond's cinematic career, SKYFALL, which is pretty much the quintessential Bond film that blends the new sensibilities of the character and storytelling combined with a great affection for many of the things that make Bond... James Bond the icon he is.<br /><br />The film opens with a pre-credits sequence that is heart-pounding and heart-stopping as Bond, along with fellow MI-6 agent Eve (Naomie Harris), pursue a man with a stolen computer hard drive, the contents of which are unknown to us at this time. The pursuit goes from car chase to rooftop motorcycle chase to on top of a moving train where a judgment call by M (Judi Dench, reprising her role for the seventh time) gets Bond shot, plummetting to his presumed death, and allows the bad guy to get away. Back at MI-6, M gets caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare as Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a seeming stuffed shirt for The Ministry of Defence steps in to announce that the drive that was stolen not only contained the list of every NATO deep cover agent in the world, but that the contents of that drive could be released and that this will all fall on M's head. In another part of the world, Bond is still alive, spending his time \\"enjoying death\\" as he beds women, engages in dangerous behavior, but he seems amused really by none of it. Soon, an explosion rocks MI-6 headquarters, resulting in the deaths of several agents and Bond decides that it's time to return home. After a series of rigorous physical and psychological tests seem to show that perhaps Bond is no longer fit for duty, M announces that he's clear and assigns him to find whoever's responsible for this attack, but one more thing is needed to complete the package: Bond needs to meet the new Quartermaster (or just \\"Q\\", if you prefer), a maybe-too-young moppy-haired computer genius (Ben Whishaw). The trail leads him to a number of exotic locales, a few battles, and then finally into the clutches of Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent and expert hacker with a VERY serious grudge against M. The tensions mount as Bond desperately fights the machinations of Silva and races to save and protect M, which then leads to a final showdown at a mysterious but very important place called Skyfall.<br /><br />The most unusual thing about this film is that, while watching it, I felt there were moments that dragged a bit at the beginning of the second act, but when revisiting it in my mind, I realized that these were moments we normally don't get in Bond films; moments of character development. The arc that Bond is given here is something that shows part of who he really is, partly in his lack of purpose during periods of inaction, his fear of losing his identity as a Double-O, and particularly in his relationship to M. To that end, Craig gives possibly his best performance to date, and firmly owns the character of James Bond. Dench again brings wit, humanity and gravitas to M, and also gives her best outing in this series. Fiennes sadly doesn't have a great deal to do, but when he does, he gives Mallory a refined pragmatic exterior but still a dangerous edge and is a welcome addition to the franchise. Whishaw is not quite the meta geek that one might expect in the post-modern self-referential age we live in, but in the scenes he has, he plays them with enthusiasm, some playfulness, but a surprising seriousness for someone of his age, demonstrating that he is definitely not too young to be Q. Harris as Eve and Berenice Lim Marlohe as Severine are the beautiful Bond Girls this time around, and they both put in considerable work despite the somewhat limited screentime they may have. The great Albert Finney comes in kind of late to the proceedings, but is great fun to watch.<br /><br />The absolute star (from an acting standpoint, anyway) of the film though is Bardem, a famously chameleonic actor, and he slips into the somewhat tragic evil of Silva with the ease of a master actor deeply at home. His introduction is something of legend and is unlike that of any Bond villain I could recall. With his dyed blonde hair and eyebrows and his effeminate affectations and demonically playful humor, Bardem makes another case for being one of the best actors working today. The best comparison that I can make to his performance and the character is that of Heath Ledger's Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT. His plan is so many steps ahead of everyone else, but everything he does, no matter how destructive, has this hint of sick humor and glee to it. Silva is less of a villain as he is an agent of fate.<br /><br />But it could be argued that the most important ingredient of this brilliant mix is Sam Mendes. From doing more \\"high-brow\\" films such as AMERICAN BEAUTY to ROAD TO PERDITION (ironically, Daniel Craig's first American film) to REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, he seemed like a very unlikely choice to helm a major franchise action/adventure film, but as it turns out, like Brad Bird on the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise, J.J. Abrams on STAR TREK and Christopher Nolan on the BATMAN films, Mendes could not have been more right to make this film. Taking the script by mainstays Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who have been working on the series together since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH), but bringing in new blood in writer John Logan (GLADIATOR, THE LAST SAMURAI, as well as Fiennes' directorial debut COROLANIUS), they bring an old-school feel with simple things like giving Bond back his Walther PPK (with the new twist of being coded to Bond's palmprint so that only he can fire it) to a reveal of an absolute classic Bond car. But perhaps the most important thing that Mendes brings is the sensibilty of being an actor's director. He understands that in order to make a great film, you have to have great characters, and here, he gets to play with many of the most iconic characters of the Bond mythology, and is able to make all of them seem fully fleshed out. With a key assist from cinematographer Roger Deakins, this team created what will more than likely come to be viewed as the archetype for what a great Bond film should be: High-flying, globe-trotting adventure with luscious landscapes and some extraordinary set pieces, but keeping the characters grounded in real human motivations that allow the audience to truly relate to their heroes (as well as the villains, in this film's case).<br /><br />SKYFALL has entered into the arena of the greatest of the Bond films by being very smart, extraordinarily well-made, extremely well-acted, but packed with enough of the charm and joy and excitement that only James Bond can bring.<br /><br />I also kinda liked the Adele song, too.

It is kind of overpriced for what is is - but hey, better than having your iRobot wandering all over. By the way, the iRobot vaccums are excellent.

0618918248|5.0|Thank you for all the insightful reviews; they are intriguing, to say the least. I have read up on Dawkin's, as well as Hawking, Hitchens and several others.  I almost became an atheist because of science and much of what I learned; however, after years of being in the boat and on the fence, I cannot abandoned what I believe is something beyond our understanding.  I beleive/know there is a God.  It is  a choice and a way of life, and sometimes there does not have to be proof.  No I do not beleive in crazy things like, I am sick because I sinned and I don't scare my kids with hell fire and damnation.  I do love sciene and learning about the cosmos, but I continue to believe there is a greatness out there and within each of us that can never be explained; it just is, as God has always been.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Given the difficulties of America in the 21st century, it is oftentimes difficult to remember that America has faced much more challenging and much more tragic circumstances throughout its history.  The biggest challenge America ever faced was not a war for freedom in some faraway part of the world, but a war for freedom on its own soil.  The Civil War, in which Southern states split off from the rest of the Union over the issue of whether African-Americans should remain enslaved, tore America apart between 1861 and 1865; and only one man was able to settle the issue.  That man was Abraham Lincoln, our nation's 16th president.  The last three months of Lincoln's life, in which he managed to accomplish so much only to have it end in his assassination, is what is detailed in LINCOLN, director Steven Spielberg's impassioned and highly involved American epic.<br /><br />Stepping into the shoes of \\"Honest Abe\\" is English actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who essays a Lincoln not as we thought we knew him, with a stentorian manner of speaking, but a high, reedy-voiced man reflecting his origins in Kentucky and Illinois whose word nevertheless carried considerable gravitas, even as he presided over the messiest conflict America would ever see.  Not only does Day-Lewis preside over the immense task, after having won a second term in office, of trying to end that conflict, but also to resolve once and for all the issue of slavery by the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.  Making things worse for Day-Lewis, even members of his own cabinet, including Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) are torn on the issue of compromise with ending the Civil War and passing the amendment with the required two-thirds majority needed in the House of Representatives.  The task for Lincoln thus falls in no small measure on two prominent Northern politicians, Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), to not only keep his Republican majority inline, but also to cause twenty Democrats to defect from the hard line of keeping slavery in place, come hell or high water.  The debate in the House, particularly with Jones commanding so much attention, is as bitter and rancorous as any we've seen in our modern era; and the final vote is 119-56 (with eight abstentions, it is just enough to allow the 13th Amendment to pass).  In the end, Day-Lewis visits many of the Civil War battle sites and reflects, in the days before his violent demise, the cost of war and the battle of ideals.<br /><br />Spielberg had handled great American historical issues and eras before in such films as THE COLOR PURPLE, AMISTAD, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but LINCOLN was clearly a personal obsession for him; indeed, this project was twelve years in the making.  And while he may not have been that much of a history buff either in grade school, high school, or while briefly a student at Long Beach State in the late 1960s, he nevertheless developed a taste for it throughout his career.  The impact of the Holocaust as shown in SCHINDLER'S LIST is what almost certainly fired his imagination, to understand the why of that tragedy; and in LINCOLN, he does very much the same thing, in illustrating why Lincoln was so important to America, not only of his time, but of all time, leading up to the 2008 election of our nation's first African-American president.  And here, he allows Day-Lewis to give a portrait of Lincoln that rates right up there with Henry Fonda's portrayal in John Ford's 1938 film YOUNG MR, LINCOLN, and Gregory Peck's in the epic 1982 TV miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.  Sally Field is also superlative as his wife Mary Lincoln; and Holbrook and Jones, seasoned veterans both, are excellent as the men fighting the good fight.<br /><br />The usual excellent score by John Williams (with some period music thrown in) and the cinematography by Spielberg's usual DP Janusz Kaminski, along with the performances, make this 149 minute-long epicextremely breathless; and Tony Kushner's fine screenplay (based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book \\"Team Of Rivals\\"), gives the cast and Spielberg plenty to work with.  As LINCOLN proves once again, Spielberg is a director capable of bringing the most difficult subject matter to dramatic life and understanding more about ourselves as human beings and as a nation at large.  Great filmmaking does that, and, without question, LINCOLN is an example of great filmmaking, certainly one of the great films of 2012.

0385536828|3.0|Sweet Tooth is a well-written novel about Serena Frome, young and beautiful, a lover of books but forced to study maths at Cambridge due to her mathematical brilliance, which she fins to be only average once she gets to Cambridge. She isn't motivated about her degree and continues her reading and eventually writing for a new school paper. She eventually has an affair with an older married professor who schools her in reading of the classics, newspapers, and politics. This is actually to prepare her to get a job with MI5 when she leaves school. Of course, it is 1973 and Serena is a woman so basically she has no expectations of being more than a lowly office assistant. Then MI5 recruits her for Sweet Tooth, an operation to funnel funds to an arts foundation to award to promising writers whose work shows them to be clearly anti-communist. They are not telling the writers what to write just giving them an upper hand to get their work noticed. Serena's assignment is to sign up Tom Healy, posing as someone who works with the arts foundation. Tom has written some journalistic pieces and short stories, wants to write a novel but feels that a full-time job will take away from his writing. Serena has no problem signing him up with an offer of a yearly stipend that will allow him to write full-time. Soon after, Serena and Tom begin an affair. This is not a calculated move on Serena's part, she just really likes him and his writing. Eventually she begins to fall in love with him and wonders if he would leave her if she told him the truth or if she can live with her secret.<br />While Serena is likeable, she is a rather passive character. Things happen to her that are a result of others, not anything she has done. And so the novel itself seems passive, right up til the end.<br />The idea of the plot was good and I loved all the talk about books and politics of the Cold War and the IRA, the idea that some people supported the Soviet union though they loathed them, simply because the idea of America having world domination makes them worry.<br />But it isn't enough to hold the story together. I enjoyed it well enough but as I got to the end, I felt a bit let down. I didn't need a spy thriller but I needed more than what I got.the idea of America having world domination makes them worry.<br />But it isn't enough to hold the story together.

B003AKLFAG|5.0|This is an amazing movie - I just couldn't stop watching.  Phenomenal acting, really twisted!  I loved it!  A story of a man imprisoned for 15 years, and he doesn't even know why.  The \\"why\\" will keep you glued to your chair, and then you'll be thinking about this movie for a very long time.  I heard an American version was being made.  They never live up to the original, but you better believe I will still see it!  Highly, highly recommended for those of us who love movies that don't fit the norm.  Fantastic movie.<br /><br />This review is edited to reflect that I just learned Spike Lee is doing the remake!  I was reading about how they are filming in New Orleans now...well, a pleasant surprise and now a must-see for me next year!
0345803493|3.0|I have to say straight away that the ONLY reason I finished this trilogy is because I'm mildly crushing on Christian - he reminds me (to a greatly magnified degree!) of a long-time friend.  Anastasia, on the other hand ... girlfriend seriously needs to put her big girl panties on and grow the frig up.  She gets bent every time she's \\"told\\" to do something.  Well, dahling ... if you're defying the man just for the sake of defying him, you're being as petty and selfish as a five year old.  Yes, I do believe Ana has regressed a bit - and Christian's supposed to be the one with maturity issues!!  I liked Ana less and less as the story progressed, and quite despised her by story's end.  While Christian's character shows steady growth, Ana remains the same touchy, whiny, worry-wart - self-centered to the end.  I enjoyed Christian quite a lot, but I'm glad I'm done with the story - please, please, Ms. James, don't write another book with this horrid, vapid woman-child as the heroine!

I was inspired by his life and his love for his family to become an even better person at work and at home.  I now have a respect for our military that I never had or even knew that I should have.  Thanks for sharing his life and his legacy in this terrific book and to all military, THANK YOU!<br /><br />A great book and one that will cause you to feel every emotion known to man!

1455508977|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is an extraordinary writer. Each of his books is so well written and they allow the reader to connect emotionally with each of the characters. For someone who has never read a Nicholas Sparks novel I think that this would be a great first book. The love that the two main characters, Logan Thiabault and Elizabeth Green, share is intense and passionate. I am certainly a softie for a good love story but this one was by far one of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Everything happens for a reason\\" is a very common saying and Nicholas Sparks proves this idea true in the novel. Logan Thiabault was a young U.S Marine who served three tours in Iraq. During his time in Iraq he found a picture of a woman. He tried to see if anyone would claim it but no one came forward. So he kept it with him. The picture seemed to have served as Logan's lucky charm. He carried it with him during terrible and dangerous events, and survived. When he returns home he decides to go on a journey in order to find the woman in the picture.<br /><br />He walks from Colorado all the way to Hampton, North Carolina. When he finds Elizabeth, She is living with her Nanna and young son Ben. He finds himself instantly attracted to Elizabeth and becomes unable to reveal the real reason he came to Hampton. The photograph. This becomes a major conflict especially when Elizabeth's jealous ex-husband Keith Clayton becomes suspicious of Logan.<br /><br />Will their love be strong enough to overcome  the challenges and struggles they will be faced with? It's worth the read to find out!

The game has 6 pages of items to build with ( I didn't count all of them, but I'd say about 20 items per page) my favorite is grass traps with a lava pit underneath. Has multiple gameplay modes ( Creative, hardcore, casual). There are very very few animals to interact with, ducks, bears, coyotes, and that's it.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|There is no easy way to describe this film.  A mixture of serious and the absurd.<br /><br />It's the serious that makes you love the characters, and empathize with their situation.<br /><br />It's the absurd that makes you laugh in the midst of very serious subject matter.<br /><br />I will say, that while the director does a fantastic job bringing the pieces together, the actors do an equally fantastic job.  The two lead kids perfectly convey being both wise, yet terribly naïve.  The big name actors are almost invisible.  By invisible, I mean you don't see Bruce Willis and say, hey, that's Bruce Willis.  You see the character instead.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Edward Norton was equally impressive with his character mind meld.<br /><br />Overall, a very enjoyable film.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Good book, but the experience contained very few of the elements that are found in the majority of near death experiences.  This is not to disparage the book, or the experience, but it raises doubt about its actual origin. Eben's brain may have been inoperative during the height of the bacterial infection, but it had to start functioning at some point.  Otherwise he would never have recovered.  It is always possible that the experience was simply a hallucination that happened during early convalescence caused by the reconnection of neurological elements.  I would prefer to take it at face value, but it hardly stands as &#34;proof&#34;.
B00000JPYQ|4.0|Alright, I'm gonna be one of the few that mildly criticizes this epic recording. Let me begin by stating that I think that \\"Strangers\\" is the single greatest live rock recording ever. Schenker signed my original and it's one of my prized possessions.<br /><br />Regarding this 1999 remastered re-issue there are positives and negatives. In the positive category, the quality of the remastering is superb. The live version of Lights Out will virtually rip your speakers to shreds if you don't watch the volume on your stereo!<br /><br />On the negative side, having owned this re-issue since it was released, I've had considerable time to think about it and I wish they had kept the song sequence the same as it was on the original LP. I know that the goal of the re-issue was to restore the concert to the sequence that was played live on the Obsession tour but if you've grown up with a song sequence one way and suddenly, that is changed, it's a bit of a downer. IMO they should have put the extra tracks (Hot 'n' Ready and Cherry) at the end as bonus tracks and kept the LP sequence. To me, this album is a work of rock art in the same vein as Sgt. Pepper's or Who's Next? It would be tantamount to sin to place A Day in the Life as the first song on Sgt. Pepper's and jumble around the other tracks, right?<br /><br />If you're new to UFO this seems like a small issue. Similarly, if you are a younger rock enthusiast and simply download your songs piecemeal into an MP3 player, not caring one way or the other about the sequence of an album, then this likewise doesn't affect you much either. For those of us who grew up with Strangers and listened to it beginning to end over and over, the remaster is a bit disappointing. I wish they would have simply listed the original concert sequence of songs in the liner notes. Then, anyone who cared to take the effort of programming their cd player, could have played the songs in the sequence of the tour for curiosity's sake. As it is, I can't listen to the re-issue beginning to end without feeling like something's wrong. Though I've not done it yet, I suppose I'll have to burn the sequence in it's original LP format to enjoy it as (for me) it was meant to be heard.<br /><br />I sound like a lazy whiner don't I! Welcome to the Internet...where opinions are as numerous as the grains of sand on a beach!<br /><br />To sum up, if you are a new UFO fan get the re-issue because the quality is second to none, however; try placing the tracks in this sequence just for the fun of it (the way they were placed on the original LP):<br /><br />Natural Thing, Out in the Street, Only You Can Rock Me, Doctor Doctor, Mother Mary, This Kids, Love to Love, Lights Out, Rock Bottom, Too Hot to Handle, I'm a Loser, Let It Roll, Shoot Shoot<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll still have some of Phil Mogg's famous banter out of sequence but at least you'll get to hear the songs in the order that left a generation of hard rockers drooling.n to the re-issue beginning to end without feeling like something's wrong.

B00A77II0U|5.0|I love playing the ho/point-click puzzle games and alawar never seems to disappoint. nice graphics and story line. nice enough of a challenge without being too difficult (but as always the hint button and/or strategy guide is there when help is needed). thanks for listening to your customers and including the bonus chapter with the puchase price this time around.<br /><br />p.s. I am starting to wonder if someone at alawar has an evil clown fetish-just saying :)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal is a perfect sharpening tool for a young scout, a begining adult or a survival enthusiast. It's very compact and fits just about anywhere. The thing that makes it a perfect tool for upcoming students is that it states what both slots, (Ceramic and Carbide) are used for and how to use the serrated blade sharpener. Very easy to use and works great in the field. I gave it a four as the stones could be a little larger, but all in all it works great for a starter.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar games never disappoint me; and this is another great one. Spooky and fun story line; I love the dollhouse. I also hope they make a Snark busters 3 !!!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I give this movie an A... why? because it circles back in time to begin to explain all of the things that we wonder about in the original Alien. No predators, no DNA clones, just original plot and whatnot.<br />SPOILER ALERT<br />At the end of the film you find yourself longing to see the sequel.... She is heading to the engineers home...what will happen what will she do, are they all hostile as the ones she encountered? GREAT opportunity to explain further.

0316228532|1.0|Fortunately I got the book from the library.  I spent a weekend reading it, got about halfway through and realized that the overwhelming depression I was feeling was coming from the book.  Returned book to library.  If you liked Confederacy of Dunces you may like this book.  There is not a single bright point in the (first half of the)book, no hope, no love, nothing of a positive nature.  I did skip towards the end to see if it picked up, instead it got even worse.  If you like dark, depressing and hopeless this book is for you.

B009F879HK|5.0|It is not my favorite tune by The Fabs yet, when taken from the standpoint of the start of the greatest rock band in history it becomes clear how great this song is.  You can't compare it to songs of today, only to songs from the early 60s.  There were no competitors.  Nobody had done anything like this before.  That is why I honor it in a case over my piano.  Lovely packaging,  extremely well protected from damage during shipping,  eye catching!  I recommend it wholeheartedly!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The story is beautiful and incredible. Of course, it is a work of fiction but...it's easy to forget that and become absolutely immersed in Pi's world. On the surface this is a story of survival, but I can't wait to read this book again and uncover some deeper meaning.

B00138CV5K|5.0|Ray Lamontagne's whispery, purring voice is what keeps me coming back for more. The beauty of his music and lyrics are just a wonderful bonus. I could listen to his folksy, bluesy sound all day. This album is six years old now but still timeless and incredible, especially compared to so much crap so many people put out nowadays. My advice to you while listening to Ray is to turn down the lights, close your eyes, and just feel the music wash over you.
0316228532|5.0|First of all Please give it a try ... It's not fair that most of the \\"One Star Ratings\\" are just based on the first couple parts of the book which -I admit- a real exhausting read specially the first part which is over 170 pages but afterward it's really deep, emotional and interesting story.<br /><br />Secondly, The Casual Vacancy's really an extreme opposite of the Harry Potter series and it's unsuitable for some of the Harry Potter's readers so it's also unfair to be reading it expecting it'll be the same kind of entertaining as Harry Potter's and here's why..<br /><br />1- Ironically the Harry Potter Series starts with the boy who lived, while this one starts with the man who had died. It's funny how Rowling deals with life and death. As Harry's being alive was what made the novel. The death of Barry Fairbrother was what has affected the lives of residents of the small city \\"Pagford\\" and every character through the novel and affected their motivations.<br /><br />2-It's not about magic at all ...It's realistic, raw, ugly most of times, unpleasant life. And that's not bad thing since it's a totally different genre ... and Rowling is really awesome in drawing the life of small town, its history and the people living there whether the rich, the middle class or the poor.<br /><br />3-There's -almost- no mystery events at least for us -as readers- only some parts of the ghost's posts plot. But it's not bad since there are many hidden parts at every character that was really fun to discover in further read and learn more about their lives.<br /><br />4-There's no actual Good Vs. Evil Plot. There's no Evil at the whole story and no pure good person either. At some points you'd feel the character is really bad, awful, arrogant and hypocritical and the same one you'd find them later just a victim of their terrible circumstances. That's why when you first meet a character especially in the first Part - which is over 170 pages- you'll find out that you really dislike and can't feel sympathy toward the characters.  For example:<br />Krystal Weedon, First impression that she's an awful teenager, you'd even feel it's weird that last thing Barry did was writing about her for the newspaper.. But you can't help notice that she's a true heart-breaking girl trapped in her terrible circumstances.<br />Also Kay when first introduced from Gavin's point of view was a terrible messy lady, but later you'd find out that she's not that bad. , she's a sincerely caring woman after all, away from the hypocrisy that existed at other characters.<br /><br />I believe that all of the characters are in their own shade of gray, there's no black and white... not totally good or totally bad except a character or two that more into the black side. That's exactly how people are in real life.<br /><br />5- In Harry Potter series the whole story is from Harry's point of view (POV) except 5 chapters from the whole series. It's totally the opposite here the book is in 7 parts every part got many chapters each chapter coming from one of the characters' perspective, even sometimes it switch from a character to another at the same chapter.. Which many reader find it's bad and a weakness of the novel .. But it's not bad at all , it may be confusing alittle but the novel introduced so many characters so quickly. So it's better to get a wide perspective to learn about each of these characters, rather than just one, and to learn more about their lives and past.<br /> Rowling's writing skills was in real test here and I believe she did it right. Especially at the last Part which wasn't in chapters. It was really amazing. It's like a journey that I've really enjoyed after all.<br /><br />6-For sorry the language is so much \\"tougher\\" than you'd imagine the Harry Potter author would write, I was in shock when I've read it and her statement:\\" \\"There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children's babysitter or their teacher. I was always, I think, completely honest. I'm a writer, and I will write what I want to write.\\"<br />However, the language is not un-common from the middle class, even the higher one that presented in the story.<br /><br />There is one common point between The Casual Vacancy and Harry Potter series which is The amazing friendship between the adolescents, their romantic interests the bullying which drawn here in amazing way , the adolescents characters and their  relationship issues with each other or with their parents was a one of the basic plots at the novel and the most well written one and some how the most heart breaking .<br /><br />I know it's not a real review But to sum up what I feel about the novel, without spoilers ... It's a Journey into realistic characters, in a small town after a certain event... When you finish that journey you'd may feel the tragic ending left u heart breaking BUT the very optimistic scene by the end -although it was like a flash back- will cheer you up and there's a touch of sweet hope that presented at the final part with some changes in a character that lead to peace after all. And without more spoilers the ending really will leave a nice feeling after all and I'm sure you may back to re-read the book in more appreciation.<br /><br />P.S. When I start part 3 I was totally into the characters so when I tried to re-read the first part at least the character introducing parts and find out it's not that bad you should try it as I've said before the first part is exhausting read just at the first read.<br /><br />P.S.2 Try to imagine your favorite cast for the characters for example I don't know why the beginning made me recall \\"Desperate Housewives\\" so I mix American cast of the show with the some adults and the adolescents from Harry Potter cast except for Krystal was Miley Cyrus in my mind.

B007XNAQPG|5.0|This is not even in the same league as Duran's frst live release Arena. This is a well thought out piece of musical art. Duran has been around long enough to know where to go when it comes to live shows. Yes, there are many hits left off and there are a few songs from AYNIN to help promote it on this tour but the songs you have come to know and love are absolute perfection. There hits catalog is so deep a proper 2 CDlive recording would be a nice teat for fans. With Roger back on drums and Dom taking over and sounding better than Andy ever did, Duran is still a force to be reckoned with. My only minor complant is I don't like shows from upbeat bands that open with a ballad. Kinda takes the wind out of your sail but as with everything Duran does there is a purpose. Art + Music. The Wild Boys/Relax Medley was a total suprise but it works. Live CD's are hard to pull off but the mix is perfect and the band is tighter than ever. The DVD/Blue Ray releases feature extra tracks.
B007L6VR12|3.0|If you are a fan of Wes Anderson (as I am), you pretty much know what to expect from his films by now.  Beautifully staged and obsessively detailed sets and cinematography, great music, quirky storylines about underdogs who don't quite fit into society... and characters whose main defining trait is usually a deep and pervasive melancholy.<br /><br />In all these respects, Moonrise Kingdom is a \\"typical\\" Wes Anderson film.  However I don't think it quite lives up to his classics like Rushmore or The Royal Tenebaums.  The performances are excellent.  Many of Anderson's usual cast of players return, including Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.  Edward Norton is hilarious as the scout troop leader who takes his responsibilities a bit too seriously.<br /><br />But this film really belongs to its 2 young stars, Jared Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy.  Both of them are excellent in their roles, although they are somewhat boxed in by Anderson's usual tendency of having his characters display very little emotion, or much enthusiasm for anything.  In a story about young first love, it would be nice if the 2 young people at least seemed a LITTLE bit excited about finding romance and a kindred spirit.  The flat affect does make the kids seem wise beyond their years, and it hints at the sadness that both have experienced - but I also think it detracts somewhat from the excitement and rush of that first adolescent romance.<br /><br />Like all Wes Anderson films, this one is enjoyable and fun to watch.  The supporting cast is excellent especially Norton, and also Bruce Willis playing against type as a quiet and lonely bachelor who ends up caring about Sam.  While not up there with Anderson's classics, it is still enjoyable and worth watching.

0553805371|4.0|For a book with such lofty ambitions in the title, Hawking keeps it pretty superficial.  You won't find much math here, or really much new science.  If you've been an avid reader of pop-science writing over the past few years, much of this will be old hat to you.<br /><br />What is ambitious is Hawking's openness with his provocative opinions and ideas.  From page 1 onward, Hawking & Mlodinow drop one \\"bomb\\" after another.  First, philosophy is off the table.  You see, science can answer pretty much everything, so suck it Aristotle.  Second, a logical, pragmatic view of the universe is thrown under the bus.  Stub your toe?  That didn't really happen, you don't really exist.<br /><br />All of this is interesting, but it kind of goes nowhere.  Hawking obviously falls into the camp of \\"everything is science at the end of the day, and as such can be quantified and studied.\\"  The only room for mystery is the limitations of scientific instruments.<br /><br />Overall, this book is an entertaining read, but don't let it turn you into that jerk at a party who wants to half-explain some of these wild theories.

B000002KKD|5.0|I was naive and nervous when I got the courage up to go to my RnR  Record Store in my small town to buy this LP when I was 17. I never looked back. From the earie opening of Planet Claire to the hilarious cover of Petula Clark's, &#34;Downtown&#34; this LP took me to another dimension of music. I never laughed at lyrics before nor smiled through an entire LP before. I was trying to figure out what kind of music to call this. All I was told by my close minded friends was i was punk and I was a freak. The Lp goes in a musical Time Capsule as one of the most creative distictive records ever. At one point they were ahead of their time until people stopped being so serious and realized they could enjoy and laugh with the band! All the classics are here plus thos that didn't get as much attention as deserved. 52 Girls is a nod to every woman alive. Lava and Hero Worsip are fantastic and overloked by some that only know Rock Lobster. Enough said. Join the party.

All the main character does is gripe and moan about everyone in her life.  She obviously thinks she is the center of the universe. Boring.  Glad I didn't spend any money on this one.  Now I will go read an entertaining and enthralling book - not some has been.
B00A2H9NZY|5.0|IMO SLEEPER MOVIE OF THE YEAR - PG and awesome!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I lived in Santa Cruz 1987-1992.  I do not pretend to be a surfer, because I am not one.  I have, however, done a lot of body surfing and body boarding (boogie boarding) in Hawaii and Santa Cruz.  Plus as a marine biologist I have spent considerable amounts of time near, in, and on the ocean.  With that being said...<br /><br />\\"Chasing Mavericks\\" is probably the best surfing movie I have ever seen.  This biopic of young Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty Hesson delves into the psyche and spiritual basis of surfing better than any other surfing movie.<br /><br />Gerard Butler turns in a stellar performance as the sage surfer who reluctantly agrees to train a teenager to surf one of the most dangerous waves in the world - Mavericks.<br /><br />To \\"get\\" this movie you have to understand this wave.<br /><br />Mavericks is surf break just north of Half Moon Bay, CA.  It breaks only when the surge is big enough and comes from the right direction.  Most offshore breaks occur over reefs that are 20 feet deep or less (e.g., Pipeline, on the north shore of Oahu), but the reef at Mavericks is twice that deep.  This means that it takes a huge wave to break there.<br /><br />In addition to the deep reef at Mavericks, there is an unusual underwater rock formation that helps big waves set up and break.  There is a sloping ramp of rock that approaches the shallow water inshore.  The water to the right and left of this ramp is deep.  The shallower water slows a wave, makes it stand up, and then plunge over explosively.  The deep water on either side keeps the focus of the wave in one location.<br /><br />This combination of factors produces waves that can be 20-80' feet tall, and is one of the most dangerous places to surf in the world.  There are only a few places in the world with waves in this size class.  OK, back to the movie.<br /><br />Young Jay Moriarity, like just about every other surfer along the central California coast those days had heard rumors of a giant wave, but it was dismissed largely as myth.  One day though, Jay discovers someone who rides that wave - Frosty Hesson - and Jay sees the wave and Frosty and his surfing partners ride the wave at Mavericks.  It takes some doing, but Frosty is finally convinced to train Jay for Mavericks.<br /><br />This movie is about what it takes to prepare not to ride a wave like Mavericks, but how to increase your chances of surviving it.  That preparation requires physical, mental, spiritual, etc., development.<br /><br />There is a good dose of surfing in the movie, and while there is a strong mental and spiritual component to the movie, it does not come across as eclectic or preachy.  it's just downright amazing!<br /><br />The sheer force and presence of the wave is awe-inspiring, and the willingness and ability of a small handful of big-wave surfers who challenge it and ride it are beyond impressive.  It borders the miraculous.<br /><br />I mean, I've been held down by a waves in the 6-8' range in Hawaii, so it's nearly impossible to imagine the amount of force in a wave the size of Mavericks.  It's a wave that you feel more than you hear or see it.  Sheer power!<br /><br />This is a movie experience not to be missed!<br /><br />5 stars all the way, and I'll be buying a copy of this movie ASAP.tral California coast those days had heard rumors of a giant wave, but it was dismissed largely as myth.

B005LAII94|3.0|We are all savages, no matter how we attempt to disguise it. Oliver Stone has brought some brilliant films to the screen - Platoon, Wall Street, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, W., Heaven and Earth, World Trade Center, etc - and it is with the expectation that his current film will live up to those standards that most viewers commit to the 147 minutes of SAVAGES. The film is long on gore and drugs, delivers some rather caricatures of ideas (Benicio Del Toro, Selma Hayak, John Travolta) and waste a lot of time on inconsequential things.  But the story itself has some merit, though it has been done many times before: the drug market can turn people into savages.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs Ben (Aaron Johnson), a peaceful and charitable marijuana producer, and friend Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a macho, hunky, rough former Navy SEAL, run a lucrative, homegrown industry - raising some of the best weed ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with Ophelia (Blake Lively) in a three-way romance. Life is an idyllic triad in their Southern California town of Laguna Beach ... until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena (Salma Hayek) and her enforcer, Lado (Benicio Del Toro), underestimate the unbreakable bond of the three friends, Ben and Chon - with the reluctant assistance of a dirty DEA agent (John Travolta) in cahoots with El Azul (Joaqu&iacute;n Cosio) - wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills involving the kidnapping of Ophelia as well as the kidnapping of Elena's daughter. Throw in cameos by Emile Hirsch, Demi&aacute;n Bichir, and what seems to be a cast of thousands, top it off by a cutesy ending suggested by the opening lines of the film, and try to get past the boring voice over storytelling by Blake lively and settle in to the gore of beheadings, and other gruesome events and you have Oliver Stone's latest. The film as its moments but it goes on far too long and doesn't have the class of the original novel by Don Winslow (who surprisingly shows up as a screenwriter!). For those who love gore and some fine actors doing a turn for the money, join in.

B000002GW5|1.0|I have heard \\"Running on Empty\\" a zillion times on the radio in my car (cheap car, cheap factory stereo) and always really liked this song. I finally found a remaster on hdtracks and bought the CD. Boy was I surprised!<br /><br />My first thought upon listening to my new purchase on home stereo system was, \\"This is a live version and it isn't very well recorded. I must have bought the live version by mistake. Maybe the studio version is what I'm used to hearing on the radio and maybe it sounds better\\". So I looked through all of Jackson Browne's CDs on Amazon and didn't find any studio version of this song. I even went to Jackson Browne's web site and looked through all his recordings and found that there is no studio version of this song - this live version is what I've heard on the radio all these years!<br /><br />The song \\"Load Out\\" is 6 min 3 seconds long and was recorded live. The last five or ten seconds is a transition into the next song, \\"Stay\\". On the original master tapes this was probably one long continuous recording with no breaks but on the CD, \\"Load Out\\" gets cut off just as it transitions into \\"Stay\\". So, you're listening to \\"Load Out\\" and it is transitioning into \\"Stay\\" and then there's this abrupt silence where the mastering engineer decided to create a new track out of \\"Stay\\". \\"Stay\\" picks up, note-for-note, right where \\"Load Out\\" ended. Either the engineer or the label decided, arbitrarily, to split this continuous \\"double\\" song in half. The first time I listened to it I thought, \\"what the h*** has my CD player done to this song???!\\" After listening to the two songs again and again, I decided to merge them into one song using a free tool called \\"Audacity\\". I just basically took \\"Stay\\" and stuck it right on the end of \\"Load Out\\" and saved it as a single song and burned me own copy of the CD with this \\"whole\\" song on it. It sounds much better to me this way - there's no idiotic, arbitrary, and unsettling hack between these \\"two\\" songs.<br /><br />On the song, \\"Cocaine\\", the last 30 seconds of the song is the crazed mutterings of, I guess, the band, and they sound stoned! The first thing you hear after the music ends is,\\"sniff, sniff\\" - I guess someone snorting coke (or at least is supposed to sound like it). Then a couple of voices start talking about \\"it takes a clear mind to make it? It takes a clear mind to take it\\", followed by weird laughter. Very weird.<br /><br />This is a strange set of recordings. On \\"The Road\\", it sounds like a studio recording for the first three minutes, then at exactly 3:00 minutes into the song, you hear a crowd cheering for a couple of seconds, then the song resumes but the sound of Browne's voice on the recording has changed - now, all of a sudden, it's big and boomy and you hear the echo of the auditorium. I wonder if they dubbed half studio/half-live together into one song here.<br /><br />One thing I do like is David Lindley's lap steel slide guitar on a lot of these songs. I've always been a fan of slide guitar and I really like David Lindley's guitar playing. For me that's a positive thing about the CD.<br /><br />This CD isn't all live. Apparently some of it was recorded live, some of it was recorded in hotel rooms while Browne was on the road, etc. Overall, it's a really dull, flat, lifeless. heavily compressed recording a good system, sadly. The last song, \\"Stay\\", is probably the one I like the most from the point of sound quality.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the lyrics on some songs are pretty dated, referring to the days of yore when CB radio was popular (that was a LONG time ago - about the same time disco was popular).<br /><br />SO if you plan to buy this CD or download the mp3s, be aware that this is not a very good recording. You may like it for other reasons - nostalgia, the lyrics, etc. but don't expect it to sound anything like what you're used to hearing on the radio.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. I was really hoping to enjoy this music!

0062197258|3.0|As with any review, it is an opinion and I have a very mixed opinion on Elizabeth Haynes's \\"Into the Darkest Corner.\\"<br /><br />I recognize that Haynes did an excellent job of storytelling. Details of the romance and subsequent obsession between Catherine Bailey and Lee Brightman is very well done. Characterizations are also excellent. The build up of tension never really lets up until that very last page. As a reader, I never really relaxed while reading this thriller.<br /><br />Yet, as I got to those last pages, I felt very mixed on it. It is really good. Yet I only felt that it was okay. I didn't really care at that last page even though I was very much into the story.<br /><br />Not sure why I felt like that. In fact, I'm tempted to change the stars from 3 to 4 because I can't quite articulate why I felt the end had the ring of an anticlimax.<br /><br />For now, I will leave as-is.<br /><br />That said, it is a very well written story and I recommend it to those who like thrillers because it does deliver thrills.

B007QPFGJW|2.0|Nesbo has a good writing style, and I became hooked on the Harry Hole series after reading Snowman.  But instead of improving the lot of the likeable characters Harry and his love interest, Nesbo has degraded them bit by bit.  I skipped the last book after reading the review and knowing that Hole was going to screw up worse than ever.  Then read this latest with high hopes.  It's a bummer...the protagonist should be on somewhat of a road to improvement or redemption, not going down the toilet one book at a time.
B009E3EY38|4.0|I received this in the mail Saturday, (thanks Amazon!), even though the release date is not until tomorrow.<br />This is a fantastic set.  We cranked it up.<br />I am disappointed in the rehearsal DVD, though.  It is a only a single, stationary camera shot, from a fair distance.  It even has people walking in front of the lens.  The audio is not as good, either.  It is a nice inclusion, since they have the footage; but, it sure is not worth the extra $9.<br />I would recommend the regular Blu-ray version.<br />(I also wish they would have put this version in a Blu case, instead of CD digipak.)<br />Anyway, a must-have Blu-ray for sure.
0142000663|3.0|The literature is great. But the pages are not well cut. I bought one, asked for a change and good the same quality. Finally, resigned and read it like that.
B0000691U1|4.0|4. Duke Ellington<br />Caravan<br />(from Money Jungle, United Artists).<br />Ellington, piano; Charlie Mingus, bass; Max Roach, drums.<br />What am I supposed to say to that? That's ridiculous. You see the way they can ---- up music? It's a mismatch. They don't complement each other. Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke.<br />Now, how are you going to give a thing like that some stars? Record companies should be kicked in the ---. Somebody should take a picket sign and picket the record company.<br />Miles Davis - Down Beat, 1964<br /><br />Money Jungle is one of the most controversial records in Jazz history. Is it a cross - generational embrace? Is it a cynical record company ploy? Is it a game changer, redefining the Jazz piano trio? Is it an honorable failure?<br /><br />How you feel about Money Jungle says something about your thoughts on group improvisation. How important is shared vocabulary? And what defines shared vocabulary?<br /><br />Miles Davis is not wrong. A consistent aspect of Davis' music is a concern for a smooth surface, with eruptions bubbling underneath. Disruption is not his thing; he also hated Monk's comping. Miles is secure enough in his taste to challenge sacred cows and received wisdom.<br /><br />It is impossible to listen critically to Money Jungle and not to notice the rhythmic inconsistencies. Rather than use this record as a pulpit from which to celebrate Ellington's \\"modernism\\", it would be so much more productive to wipe the dust off Money Jungle and really look at it - or listen to it!<br /><br />Rhythmically, it's a mess. Duke pounds out strong beats, Mingus elides them, Max Roach is forced to mediate. Duke never tries to move away from this explicit relation to 4/4. Mingus never gives up on his more gestural playing. Anybody who thinks that Duke is really listening to Mingus is just not paying attention. But what results from all of this clashing may ultimately be more valuable than the \\"good taste\\" of a well - balanced Jazz piano trio. Or maybe not.<br /><br />Money Jungle is not my favorite Ellington trio record. That would be Piano In The Foreground from a couple years earlier, with a rhythm section that was much more aligned with Ellington's \\"older\\" time feel. One misses the gestural freedom and brilliance of Mingus and Roach, but one gets, in its place, a much clearer sense of gestalt from piece to piece.<br /><br />There are amazingly beautiful things that happen on Money Jungle. Just not consistently.  A track will begin brilliantly, lose its groove, and never really find it again. There are too many straight 12 - bar Blues forms that don't really add much to the idiom and speak of the ultimately slapdash nature of the session. The track A Little Max is particularly stilted and woeful rhythmically. Obviously meant as a little Ducal charmer (there are literally hundreds of these brilliant little baubles), it doesn't take well to its new status as a psychodrama. Fleurette Africaine is perhaps the biggest success on the disc. Duke is not as insistent as elsewhere and this allows Mingus and Max's freedom to feel more organic. It's also a beautiful little piece (another minor Blues, but a special one). REM Blues is really frustrating: Duke sets up one of his favorite funky grooves; the other two make intermittent stabs at laying it down between periods of wandering off to the ozone. Wig Wise has some crazily inconsistent Mingus, but inspires some of the most driven playing of Duke's career.<br /><br />Sometimes I think that Mingus is trying to channel the late, lamented Jimmy Blanton, hoping that this will inspire Duke to really interact with him. But this never really happens.<br /><br />Mingus: a wild, angry man, always searching for connection. Duke: a Brahmin, high up on an ivory tower constructed purely out of his own genius, using every mannerof distancing device - humor, irony, bon mots - to keep anyone from getting too close.  And yet, no one did more than Mingus the composer and bandleader to keep Duke's message alive and update it without losing sight of its essential, innate qualities. And this was their only real meeting on record. Well, these are the cruel ironies of life...<br /><br />We have to listen to Money Jungle both for what it is and, also, for what it might have been.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great choice as far as headsets go for the price, matte black finish so it doesn't show prints.  The simulated 7.1 sounds pretty great, and the updated software is fantastic.

B009GIPDQS|5.0|This is a story with a kick that you have no idea where it came from. The plot is a diversion from the usual way that Grisham writes. I can bet you that while the story could be slow at times, the plot is unraveling below and you will be surprised, doubly surprised at how this ll ends. Let me not spoil the fun by saying too much, but I am sure if you are a reader likes me who sometimes skims the pages when not exciting, I advise that you take it slow as you will miss the moment where the plot kicks in if you do so!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is an incredible eye opener. This stuff should be taught in schools!<br /><br />It is amazing how confused we all are when it comes to nutrition. We are given contradictory arguments at every turn. Yet real nutrition and well being is simple. Switch to a plant based diet. It is that simple.<br /><br />This study, which spanned over 20 years and included thousands of subjects, reveals that there is a direct correlation between meat protein and chronic diseases, as well as cancer. Eliminate the meat protein in your diet and you eliminate your risks of getting sick, and in many cases you can even reverse your medical conditions!<br /><br />The best part of all this is that this is a scientific study. It is not an opinion, or a belief, or some silly fad diet. It is science.<br /><br />Read this book and save your life.

B006M7JCC2|4.0|I have read many 'spiritual' how-to books and they basically all give different pointers to the same 'philosophies' or perspectives on living life peacefully and joyfully. Anita's book landed beautifully for me and has helped to ACTUALLY shift some of the constraining ways of thinking of my conditioned mind to experiencing life in a more accepting and fearless way.
0345803485|1.0|I tried to read this with an open mind, really I did. I'm in the right demographic, I'm not overly religious or prudish by nature and I'm pretty down with the whole artistic expression and fulfillment of fantasies thing. Whatever floats your boat, so long as it isn't illegal and doesn't hurt anyone right? So this series, given all the hype, should have been at least tolerable. But it wasn't.<br /><br />Instead it was...meh. Honestly I was prepared to hate it and breathe fire over it's horrid portrayal of women being catty, materialistic idiots who will do anything to land a rich, handsome gent to take care of them forever. But then the men in the series were equally horrid--dumb, narcissistic, oversexed, controlling and emotionally damaged. It was pretty much equal time for bad cliches of both the sexes all the way around, so in all fairness I couldn't even get on my high horse about this book being a slap in the face to women's equality or upholding the stereotypical male model of superiority. Both Anastasia and Christian were pretty much dumb, clueless, unrealistically drawn and portrayed caricatured ripoffs of a million other novels. Oh wait, that's right--Edward and Bella for starters since supposedly those novels are the germ for this set of novels. Although I really failed to see anything remotely alike other than the heroine in both series being annoying google-eyed over guys.<br /><br />Really this book and the others in the series turned out to be just another Harlequin Romance tossed up with a few handcuffs and spankings. Anyone who's ever read romances pretty much knows the formula, which is why I stopped reading that genre by the age of 16. They were all boringly predictable for their 1,2,3 same cake, different frosting storytelling. You know, guy and girl meet and one or both dislike the other one. But there's a spark and attraction grows in spite of one or both fighting it. Finally guy and girl give in to said spark and kiss/romance/have sex etc. depending on how risque the author wants to get with their characters. Things start to look up for our hero and heroine and then outside activities and people drive said guy and gal apart. Oh, the agony! They hate each other again. Then love each other again. This whole love-hate thing maybe goes on through one or more chapters and/or books with more problems being thrown at them while they try and fight against and toward each other. Oh the inhumanity! Then in the end love prevails--woohoo--and all is well. The end. So now I've told you the entire plot to this trilogy, oh except maybe the sex toys stuff. And that I'm pretty sure you can find in lots of other places done better. In fact, I'm pretty sure E.L. James got most of what she wrote from those places to begin with. So I ended up reading a trilogy where I felt zero anything for the heroine, but annoyance over her self-centered stupidity and a sort of mild amusement and contempt for the hero whose Mommy issues would make Oedipus blush. And I didn't like anyone else who happened along in its pages either. And nope, there was nothing in there that sparked an interest in spicing up my love life. If anything I felt sort of turned off in places--hint: we don't really need to hear about how certain sex toys are sanitized Anastasia, we just don't.<br /><br />What I did feel was a tremendous sense of boredom while skimming the pages just so I could say to anyone trying to defend this drivel that yes, I did read the books. (Or tried to anyways, thankfully my past skills as an editor/proofreader having to skim manuscripts for potential came in handy here) I also experienced a growing sense of puzzlement over how this got onto the pages of any bestseller list. Then it hit me--the books aren't any good, they never were. But the marketing was brilliant and so just like a bad boy band or pop teen princess who can't sing or reality star who can't act the advertising and marketing industry people sweep in arm-in-arm with the popular media to tell everyone that THIS IS THE NEXT BIG THING!!!! And unfortunately people believe it then buy the stuff thereby fulfilling what was up to that point merely an Emporer's New Clothing sort of gig.<br /><br />Wake up peeps, there's nothing here but fodder to sell cornflakes, Hallmark cards and Valentine's Day swag. In short, this is actually 50 Shades of Marketing and nothing else and it's definitely not original or edgy anything. Although maybe it is edgy when you consider it in the context of the following quote from one of my past favorite TV series MTV's \\"Daria.\\"<br /><br />Daria Morgendorffer: \\"As far as I can make out, 'edgy' occurs when middlebrow, middle-aged profiteers are looking to suck the energy - not to mention the spending money - out of the 'youth culture.' So they come up with this fake concept of seeming to be dangerous when every move they make is the result of market research and a corporate master plan.\\"<br /><br />Sound familiar?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I admit, most zombie movies follow basically the same formula: something causes the zombie apocalypse, most of society is wiped out and the few remaining survivors go through the wrecked world scraping out an existence.  Walking Dead, because it's an ongoing TV show, goes beyond that.  It gets into the psychology and sociology of the survivor group.  It shows the stress caused by living in this new world situation and how people cope with it on a day to day, moment by moment basis.  I applaud the writers for keeping it fresh and the audience guessing.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is indeed life-changing not only because of the story, but because of the way the novel is written.<br />Although told by the incongruous viewpoint of Death, he is warm, kind and loving.<br />The character development of Liesel, her family and her best friend, Rudy, are beautifully executed.<br />But, what makes this book about WWII different is two things: 1. the book is written from the German civilian point of view, one that is very rare. The main populace of Germans were very afraid of Hitler and were persecuted and killed not only by their own countrymen but by the Allies too. This novel shows the very human and tragic fate of typical city dwelling Germans of the time.<br />2. The writing is SUPERB!! There is much poetry in Zusak's writing, which is astoundinly beautiful.<br />This is NOT JUST A BOOK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT SHOULD BE READ BY EVERYONE!!!<br />I can't say enough about how amazing this book is.<br />Please read it!!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Historical movies, in general and even the most effective ones, are inevitably daunting and biased affairs.  No matter how objective a director thinks they are in presenting a historical figure, the period and themes they choose in depicting the figure often betray the director's subjective purposes and interests about him.  We can never learn \\"the truth\\" about anyone, especially historical figures we cannot witness first-hand.  Despite the lofty mountain of research he has inspired, this is true of Lincoln himself.  Spielberg certainly realized this and focused his saga on the final, fourth year of the Civil War, on the beginning of Lincoln's second term in office, and most specifically, upon efforts to ratify the 13th amendment, which basically abolished slavery and by extension all forms of servitude.  In reviewing \\"Lincoln\\", I will not relate all the specific characters, settings, and details; so many reviewers, Amazon and otherwise, have thoroughly seen to that (and more authoritatively than I ever could).  I wish to narrow my focus on what I see as one of \\"Lincoln\\"'s most ironic and prominent themes - the \\"ideal\\" of noble selfishness.<br /><br />  I believe that, at heart, we are all selfish, or if you prefer the euphemistic adjective, \\"self-concerned\\".  Even when we do things for and help others, our primary objective is \\"what do we get out of it?\\".  This is not to detract from charitable, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing deeds.  What I am saying is that, in my opinion, no one can achieve pure altruism, e.g. complete selflessness.  But, I think we can achieve the next highest ideal: noble selfishness, that benefits many others besides yourself.<br /><br />  \\"Lincoln\\" argues that successful politicians adeptly use noble selfishness to achieve their objectives.  Even in our current period where revisionist Lincoln scholars have striven to demythologize and \\"humanize\\" our 16th president, presenting that theme takes no small courage. Lincoln's efforts to compel a 2/3 majority of obstreperous, \\"self-concerned\\" Representatives (2/3 of the Senate had voted in favor) - many of them Democrats (not Lincoln's party, the Republicans, who ironically, to many, resemble today's Democrats) revealed traits that have negative connotations for many of us.<br /><br />  For example, as the movie showed, Lincoln exhaustively chatted up, or had lackeys chat up, many 13th amendment dissenters, even to the point of quid pro quo.  Early in the movie, we see throngs of supplicants and job seekers waiting to see Lincoln to seek favors, patronage, and legal advice, in order to show that conciliatory, compromising, manipulating tone was part of Lincoln's character.  Although historically shown to abhor slavery, arguably Lincoln had another, perhaps paramount, purpose for passing the 13th amendment - to disenfranchise the South, weaken their fighting morale, and acclerate their surrender and the Civil War's end.  In the movie, some representatives claimed that a Southern delegation from the Confederacy's president Jefferson Davis wished to see Lincoln to discuss peace terms.  The claim seemed dubious but did threaten some representatives' resolve to pass the amendment.  In the movie, Lincoln hastily pens a letter and has it delivered to the House, stating that \\"as far as I know\\", no delegation was forthcoming, which some representatives denounced as a \\"lawyerly dodge\\".  Lincoln was even willing to use a type of \\"eminent domain\\" to thwart the South by seizing the slaves as \\"property\\" from the South, then employing the Emancipation Proclamation, enacted earlier, to set them free.  Lincoln even tries mathematical logic, stating that if two things are individually equal to a third, then they are equal to each other.  This, which incorporated with Thaddeus Steven's assertion in the House that even if all men were not really created equal in nature, they were equal under the law, attempted to circumvent those representatives that thought that African-Americans were fundamentally inferior.<br /><br />  And so it goes.  The movie shows Lincoln employing every political, legal, and logical weapon to flatter, wheedle, coax, intimidate, persuade, and entice as many representatives as possible (especially the 20 House democrats necessary to achieve the 2/3 majority) to vote for the 13th amendment.  Again, some audiences may have been shocked by the seemingly base, hypocritical, self-contradictory, and unscrupulous tactics the 16th president used.  Basically, it's a concession to the old adage that \\"the end justifies the means\\".  In any case it worked, of course, the amendment is passed.  Tellingly, the deciding vote, by the House speaker, stemmed from his desire to \\"make history\\".<br /><br />  Of course, \\"Lincoln\\" has its other virtues like Daniel-Day Lewis's spellbinding portrayal of the President, Tommy Lee-Jones tour-de-force as the savagely but amusingly brusque, candid, and insulting Thaddeus Stevens, and the re-creation of the oppressive, anxious Civil War zeitgeist.  But above all, I think, \\"Lincoln\\" will have relevant, enduring value because of its assertion that compromise, however superficially distasteful and beholden to the innate selfishness of others, is really the only way to get grand political accomplishments.  I hope Obama and congressional members see the movie and retain that message.icans were fundamentally inferior.<br /><br />  And so it goes.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|One of Pixar's best! I love everything about this movie, especially since the characters are ancient Celts and that era has to be my favorite time period. Maybe I'm partial to the landscape and time but there is something about the charm of the characters and the breathtaking shots that make this movie a must have for anyone, even if they don't have kids!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A good, dependable field sharpener is a great thing to have, especially if you're hard on your knives. Smith's PP1 fulfills this role quite nicely, and it has become a part of my camping kit. Its small size makes it great for tying to a pack and leaving alone until it's needed, and the sharpeners can get my CRKT Pazoda from mildly dull to shaving-quality sharpness in only a few strokes. It seems to work equally well for my Gerber Prodigy, but I haven't tried to sharpen that blade to the same level of sharpness as my CRKT, because honesty who shaves with a 4.5\\" survival knife?<br /><br />The only problem I can find is that while the sharpeners were designed to be reversible and replaceable, I have yet to find a source to buy such sharpener replacements. When this one gets dull, I'll probably just throw the PP1 away and buy a new one (which seems a waste). But at ~$8, they sure make it easy.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I rented this movie because of Daniel Radcliffe.  His acting is good.  But something was lacking in this movie...  Writing, story line, etc.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Heartwarming with a touch of humor.  Just rewatched it for the first time in 5 years and forgot how much i loved robert deniro on this one lol
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Entertaining for one or two books. If you are the type that can buy a bag of M&Ms and save some for the next day this 4 book bundle might be okay. I found these books, which I stupidly read all in a row, to be tiresome.<br />Also, I've got nothing against a little murder and sex in a story, but I found the level and presentation here to be more than a little crass.<br />In the end I enjoyed it, but three stars because it's not top notch.
0385536828|5.0|A naive and impatient reader becomes an agent for the state, spies on a writer, and becomes his lover. Then the writer turns the tables on the reader--and this happens on two levels.  There are shifting identities here--for the characters, the writer, and the reader.<br /><br />This inventive novel is about the relationship between the writer and the reader. It's a love affair, but do lies matter more than truth? This novel is also about the conflict between artistic imagination and government intelligence. Which one has the greater power to control public opinion? The state would like to control the arts, but in the end art succeeds where intelligence fails.<br /><br />Writing itself plays a role in the lives of the characters.  When truths are revealed to the characters, they are in the form of short stories, a letter, or a novel.<br /><br />Is fiction a form of espionage?  When you inhabit another human being as a writer or a reader, do you learn more about your subject or yourself?<br /><br />Ian McEwan is my favorite contemporary writer. He consistently gives the reader timely topics, engaging plots, realistic characters, weighty themes, and clever surprises. He understands the awesome power of fiction!
B007EW9ISM|3.0|It's great for writing and drawing on the iPad.  I feel I have more control with it than any other non smart stylus.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5, is that the black comes off on your fingers.<br /><br />Update: I lost my first Cosmonaut that I purchased a year or so ago and the review here was written for its replacement.  The tip on the newest one is very very squishy compared to my previous one.  It's almost as squishy as the mainstream styluses on the market. As a result the stylus is not much use for taking notes.  I am quite disappointed and wondering if my current stylus is defective and I should try buying another one.  I am knocking a star off of my previous rating as a result of this issue.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the progression of difficulty and the look and sound of this game. Great way to unwind and have some fun.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie with my 11 year old niece.  It is a good family movie.  Would recommend this movie.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great movie beginning of the end... happy with the product itself, new to the Blu-Ray scene, but happy with it!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I started with Gone Girl and quickly worked my way through all three of the authors books.  She has a unique voice and I certainly enjoyed all of the stories.  I would recommend starting with Gone Girl first.  Any one of the books gives a taste of the author's style that will influence the reader's enjoyment of the other books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is really fun and addicting! I can never set it down. its really good to play when I'm bored.
B0086449YA|5.0|Great 2 CD set.Wonderful as always. Nice to have some new work to listen to . If you like Mark Knopfler you will love this CD.
B002NHIJTW|5.0|Just the right mix of action, fantasy & romance.  The casting is brilliant and very well-balanced.  This is the first time in my life I've ever really gotten this into a tv series.  Ian Somerholder is by far my favorite character, plus he has that whole tall, dark & handsome thing going on!  Love it!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Favorite vacation escape. For the price, can't beat it! Plays well on my iPad. Love to get a few minutes in, using my iPhone with it all synching the next time on the iPad. My kindle iPad app is excellent.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is great, you can listen to it over and over without getting sick of it.  The music is original and moving.
B00024I0OC|4.0|Valentyne Suite:  To me, Colosseum showed Chicago how it's done.  Jon Hiseman, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Tony Reeves formerly with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers..
B002PNER9U|5.0|Very good acting, remarkable music, heart-wrenching story. \\"This is the film version of the Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical about Bohemians in the East Village of New York City struggling with life, love and AIDS, and the impacts they have on America\\"([...]).  Very good production, whose shortcomings you will probably miss, as you will be so taken by the story and the human drama.  You should also look up Jonathan Larson, the composer and playwright, who received 3 posthumous awards for RENT!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|For those of you who purchased \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Stronger\\", you already have the bulk of Kelly's best hits. That is why I highly recommend that you find and purchase the DELUXE CD /DVD VERSION. The cd has a couple of additional tracks like \\"Trouble with Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Diaster\\" live. The DVD includes all 14 of KELLY's VIDEOS up to \\"Dark Side\\"<br /><br />\\"Catch My Breath\\" and \\"People Like Us\\" are 2 of 3 new tracks exclusive to this release and they both are radio friendly upbeat tracks. They reveal that Kelly's career has only way one to go - straight up!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been wheat and gluten-free for about 3 weeks.  No other diet change; no extra exercise and I have lost 13 pounds and my belly. I'm not allergic to wheat or gluten but feel so much better without it.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|No fall season is complete without watching The Rocky Horror Picture Show!  How can one move be such a cult classic?  Simply put, it is different- funny, quirky, scary, disturbing and unexpected all at once. This movie is definitely an oldie, but a goody!  Who can resist it?<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0385536828|3.0|A cavity in a tooth is a bad result, usually, from something good.  In the case of this book, however, I view the ending as the \\"good\\" result while the rest is less enjoyable.  Despite even this, the end isn't that great.<br /><br />I suppose I'm growing tired of the narrative tricks some male British writers continue to trot out each year.  McEwan's novel follows Julian Barnes' \\"Sense of an Ending,\\" which itself followed \\"Atonement\\" from several years before.  Beyond experimentation with the narrative voice, there isn't much here other than a sentimental retrospective -- cloaked in espionage -- of how life evolved at a pivotal moment for one woman and those around her.<br /><br />It is a nice story, but the book feels like a waste of McEwan's talents.  He writes such crisp sentences and develops characters in such a tight (yet fulfilling) way that it is a shame that this particular story gets bogged down in places and becomes a writer's workshop of short stories mixed throughout.  I found myself reading the snippets of short stories and thinking, \\"He is showing off.\\"  (Yes, I guess that becomes part of the point as the novel moves towards the conclusion).  I found that the stories didn't add much or further compliment Serena's world, or the world of those around her.  They only served to further muddle the plot and what made her who she became.<br /><br />If you're into trickery, then the ending may be enough for you.  If you're into a fuller story that shows broader character evolution or fully fleshes out themes of relationships, gender, and love, then perhaps look elsewhere.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This was a good movie! But when I ordered it, I ordered thinking I was to recieve the 2-disc dvd + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy version. All I received was the rental version from Hastings. I was highly disappointed because I was looking forward to checking out the special features!<br /><br />The movie was great! I just wish they would have been more specific in the description.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|First I'll start off by saying, WOW, the colors and scenes in this movie are breath-taking and I love the accents (though people behind me were complaining about not catching what was being said). I love Merida's fiery red hair and her independent spirit. I love her oafish father and her prim mother.<br /><br />That being said, I thought this movie had elements in it that go right over anyone eight and under's head. Choosing between suitors for the good of the country? Do young kids even know what a suitor is? Or why alliances between countries were formed often times though marriage?<br /><br />This movie is also dark, scary and violent at times, with a freaky witch and some very intense bear scenes. My five year old flew off her chair and landed in my lap. My seven year old was closing her eyes and covering her ears.<br /><br />Those scenes aside, there is much humor in this movie and I found myself laughing as loud as the kids, and there is also touching, sentimental scenes where a tear or two might appear.<br /><br />This is a movie where parents will have to be the judge. A tender child might be traumatized after watching this, while a \\"tougher\\" child will find it all very exciting.<br /><br />A good movie, but a bit violent and dark.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|There are many versions of this release or re-release, however you look at it.<br /><br />There is the standard 8 track \\"Paradise\\" version featuring the singles, \\"Ride\\", Blue Velvet\\" and Bel Air\\".<br />But for those of you who really like Lana's venture into Club /dance music then I would highly recommend<br />the 10 track \\"Paradise\\" version featuring 2 rare remixes of Blue Velvet - The Penguin Prison Remix and the Lindstrom Remix.<br />These two songs alone are worth the price and this version is unfortunately exclusively avaliable via one American company..<br /><br />For true die-hards, I would suggest getting the EXCLUSIVE DELUXE BOX SET, embossed in gold and features a special digipack of 'Born To Die' The Paradise Edition and comes with an exclusive remix album, 4 card prints, a 7'' picture disc of 'Blue Velvet' and a DVD containing all the amazing videos.<br /><br />The remix cd contains:<br />01 Video Games (Joy Orbison Remix)  5:00<br />02 Video Games (Omid 16B Remix)  5:14<br />03 Born To Die (Moodymann Remix)  6:11<br />04 Born To Die (Gemini Remix)  4:48<br />05 Blue Jeans (Gesaffelstein Remix)  4:36<br />06 Blue Jeans (Penguin Prison Remix)  5:37<br />07 National Anthem (Fred Falke Remix Edit)  3:46<br />08 National Anthem (Tensnake Remix)<br /><br />This will sell quickly and increase in value!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love the book. A book anyone can relate to as we've all been through those awkward teenage years. It is also a very quick read.
B0086449YA|4.0|If you like Mark Knopfler you will love this double CD set!  Records take you through quite a wide range of tunes that are remarkably heart felt!
B000PMFS2I|3.0|I have a clip of a movie called \\"SHOWGIRLS\\", where a female and male are fighting, she's really having fun, useing her hole body, {by the way with no, no top on} to bring him to, to being her, being her-well I don't think I can use that word in the REVIEW, QUESTION: is this that movie, I know the title to the clip I have is \\"SHOWGIRLS\\", anybody know?
B009IQG5LK|1.0|You know Disney hasn't been fair with it's releases - all of the Marvel/Disney DVDs have been pretty bare bones compared to other Marvel films - then last year I made the mistake of pre-ordering Rocketeer and of course I found out after I got it that it wouldn't have any special features. Disney, why are you so blatantly pursuing this double dip model? It only offends the true fans of these films who have been patiently waiting for the blu ray releases.
0765348780|5.0|You jump into the middle of a story, but once you get your teeth into it you wont want to let go.  The hardest part when starting is switching between the stories in the different books. This is by far my favorite fantasy series.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Many have complained that the U.S. version is missing some of the bonus tracks although they are listed.<br /><br />Get the U.K. version that is the Ultimate one for fans. For true die-hards, I would suggest getting the EXCLUSIVE DELUXE BOX SET, embossed in gold and features a special digipack of \\"Born To Die\\"( all 15 tracks), The Paradise Edition (with 8 tracks) and comes with an exclusive remix album, 4 card prints, a 7'' picture disc of 'Blue Velvet' and a DVD containing all the amazing videos.<br /><br />The remix cd contains:<br />01 Video Games (Joy Orbison Remix) 5:00<br />02 Video Games (Omid 16B Remix) 5:14<br />03 Born To Die (Moodymann Remix) 6:11<br />04 Born To Die (Gemini Remix) 4:48<br />05 Blue Jeans (Gesaffelstein Remix) 4:36<br />06 Blue Jeans (Penguin Prison Remix) 5:37<br />07 National Anthem (Fred Falke Remix Edit) 3:46<br />08 National Anthem (Tensnake Remix)<br /><br />This will sell quickly and increase in value!
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I love new girl. After buying a few episodes, I'm tempted to but the entire season. This is the only show that makes me laugh out loud
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Good seller, would do business again.  Make sure to stipulate, and make clear, you want the US format.  Otherwise you might get the PAL version.  It was, of course, filmed in London.  US and PAL are not compatable, just ask Obama.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was an ok book not up to his usual standards. I found it slow to start, it moved on a bit a quarter of the way into it. I usually can't put his books down. The plot was a little convoluted. Not his best work
B009LA1QW6|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high after Born To Die, or maybe it just needs to grow on me. I will say that I really, really enjoy half of the album. Ride, American, and Body Electric are all great. It just seems to me that something is lacking on this album that made BTD so great. I also wasnt very happy with the same recycled themes and lyrics from her last album. If you liked Born To Die, you will like this as well but probably not as much. If you haven't even listened to Lana Del Rey, start with her freshman album and go from there.
B006OEPITO|3.0|I found the choice of words conveys well what the story is about.  However, the translation leaves out prepositions or other words, which is sometimes a bit distracting.  But for the price, I feel it's pretty well done.
B009P5S11G|4.0|It is often a risk for any artist to release new music in such short periods of time. It was only last year that \\"Talk That Talk\\" was released and \\"Drunk on Love\\" or \\"Farewell\\" could have easily been released as singles.  For Rihanna this is not the case. Rather, \\"Unapologetic\\" is a testimony that she is at her creative peak both lyrically and sonically.<br /><br />\\"Unapologetic\\" sounds like a continuation to RiRi's last two releases with many potential hits. The musical influences are varied from Hip Hop as in \\"Fresh off the Runway\\" to the Electro or Club numbers as in \\"Diamonds\\" and \\"Right Now\\" , the latter produced by David Guetta.<br /><br />The deluxe version is the better purchase as it contains two remixes of \\"Diamonds\\", as well as the Emile Sandé -penned ballad \\"Half of Me\\" where she tells us that our view of her is only partially correct. We have only half the picture of who she truly is. Perhaps that explains her album cover as it seems to reflect all the negative and positive images the public and media have made towards her.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|I thought the movie overall was ok, but not one I would watch again. Probably funny for mom and dads to be.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|un-original but still entertaining.  reminds me of alice in wonderland.  i had a coupon so it was free, no complaints about stream quality
