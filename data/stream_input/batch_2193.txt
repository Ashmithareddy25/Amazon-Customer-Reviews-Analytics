B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My children all love this movie. It is filled with Disney magic!! Highly recommend!! Thank you! Look forward to the next movie!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This series is great!  If you haven't had the opportunity to watch it I highly recommend. ** ** ** **
0316228532|3.0|The only likable character in this story is the dead guy and he dies on page two.  Every character was an insipid, self-centered image of today's looking out for number one society.  I had no idea the UK was turning into the same as half of America. It's still a readable story, although I kept being overcome with the desire to throw it at the wall, to try and hurt the characters as much as they were hurting me.
B0029XZODY|5.0|Dexter is a brilliant Showtime series.  ***** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **  ** ** **
0756666937|5.0|We bought this book for our three boys for Christmas of 2012. They have spent hours pouring over the pages of this book just dreaming of all the things they can make and do with Legos. They have taken many ideas from this book to create their own creations. It has been as fun for them as actual Legos! I highly recommend this book for the Lego enthusiast in your family!
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|Another great season of Dexter!  Way to go Showtime! ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun to play.  Very addictive.  My kids love to play also.  This game will have you hooked after just a few plays.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I am new to this type of game, I mostly play FPS or flying/racing simulations on PC but this makes learning very easy and fun. One thing that I am not used to is online play, asking strangers to be a friend, seems lame to me but I guess I will get used to it. Remember that this game is pretty big and if you are using Kindle Fire HD once the drive gets filled up the device gets very slow. So, I found the best way to deal with that is to USE THE CLOUD !<br />Anyway, this game is very well put together and it is 100% CapeCodMediaKing approved ! Official 5 star rating
B008220DIC|1.0|I can't believe how boring and convoluted this movie was I was expecting something much better from the actors. This is truly one of the worst movies of seen inyears
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is amazing. I am officially addicted!! works well on my galaxy note...which is awesome since its supposedly not compatible with my phone thru the regular app store!!
030758836X|4.0|Wow, this is one seriously f***'d up book, and I don't say that lightly. It took me a good three weeks to get through the first half of the book. Very slow, when you consider that I can easily read 100 pages in a day. I should have been done this book in less than a week. Then I picked up the book once more to slog through a few more pages, when all of a sudden, it came at me like a frigging freight train. I finished 200+ pages in a day. I could not put it down at all. At. All.<br />The characters are so messed up in so many ways. And I can't say much more than that, because I'm afraid I'll spoil it. If you haven't read it, you should read it!<br />All I can say is that I hope my life never becomes like this book. Or that I ever become that messed up.
B00511QI4A|5.0|If the Bible ever needs a Fifth Golpel David Baldacci should write it.  Sacrilegious of me? probably... but true.<br />Everything that he writes is ipso facto a hit, and Total Control is excellent. When I write a review I like to just say the way I felt when I read the book and why... and this novel has everything to make one feel complete while reading it and after one has finished it.  The characters are good and each has a valid reason to be what they are; the plot is well planned, and for what I can see and recognize, the research was well done as well.<br />Read it, it's one of those novels that you will read again in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game a lot! I can't even wait until I get home from school to play! It's that  AWESOME AND ENTERTAINING!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Can't help being a Trekkie fan, I don't care which... original, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, etc.  (And yes, I am female.)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I recommend every one to play it it is addicting I'm wondering what the next place is going to be I LOVE subway surfers my favorite place so far is Rome.
0071766588|4.0|I'm study TOEFL now and this book have good exercises and DVD.<br />I always use that to do read and listen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers are awesome because it lets us relax and play. When you do something different every month it is fun to see if we can get the boards and people in time. All an all subway suffers is awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good game.really addictive . But the missions get really hard.<br />The characters could be a bit cheaper and the boards are great.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed reading Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks.  This book<br />was suspenseful with a good love story.  I will read other books by this author.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|i love suits even though it competes against my favorite show scandel i love it as well i will see it a 1.00 at night or sunday am at 9 or downloaded i  i love it i would give it 20 stars if that was the max
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Greaat but needs diiferent scenery like the streets as should have different levels and stuff and so on like a extreme level thaat goes fast all the time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game it has many challenges and it keeps u on it toes about what's next also the guy in bunny suit makes me laugh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so cool I love this game and I like how it changes the themes I love it so much
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Great sequel! A twist that I didn't really see coming. Better than the first book, and definitely makes me want to read the next. Hoping the 3rd book is just as good if not better.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I always use  it with my home  work and it always always helps me with every thing  I do  happy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game!it is the best game I have. And I found out how to Get the update to get to Rome. You search for the game in Amazon app store then click on it. Then click the button that says update.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is WAY BETTER than the first one. Better graphics and more upgrades and some much new stuff. And FREE!!! You GOT to get this game!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway surfers is really awesome game all you have to do is try your best and try to not die
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like t :) e way the competitions are set up where you have control of how well your horse does.  I think I am becoming addicted to the game.  And it is still fun without spending the money for all the extra gems.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book! It was a little slow starting, but worth the time spent finishing it. Good ending!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like that there are many free puzzles to choose from in addition to ones you can buy. A fun way to do puzzles on a tablet.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a real cool game me and my brother will spend all day playing this it is real fun!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS JUST LIKE TEMPLE RUN BUT MUCH FUNNER YOU SHOULD REALLY GET THIS IT NOW WORKS ON KINDLE FIRE AND HE!
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|Also similar to Dan Swano's Nightingale too of course.  Great performance on lead vocals on this album.  I think I like this album better than Katatonia's new one, at least songs are standing out more on this album on first listen.  My favorite songs are tracks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 5.  I also think I like this album more than Riverside's previous effort, but I need to go back and compare.  Also overall very well produced.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|The FiiO E5 is a well-built, inexpensive headphone amp. Unlike the newer FiiO E6, the E5 is made of mostly of metal with some plastic. It has a power button, a volume button (if you opt to use the optional L9 line out dock cable to connect to your iPod),a power/charging light, a mini-USB port (and cable) for charging with a PC, a headphone jack, and input jack, a metal clip (to fasten it to something when you're on the go??) and a bass boost button (to switch between normal and bass boosted mode).<br /><br />Pros - well built, easy to use, inexpensive (ok, cheap), bass boost button works<br />Cons - Effectiveness varies from headphone model to headphone model, normal setting makes headphones sound tinny<br /><br />I tried the E5 with a variety of vintage headphones - Numark, HV115, Stanton Dynaphase Fifty, Sennheise HD420SL and HD422, Koss SST/5, and Audio Technica ATH-701. All of the headphones sounded louder at the same volume setting, some much more than others. Using bass boost, most of the headphones had a noticeable bass boost, though the Sennheisers and the Audio Technica did not, and they also had the least loudness boost.<br /><br />Comparing the E5 to the comparable Firestone Fireye mini, some headphones sounded better with the E5 (like the Koss), while some sounded better with the Fireye (the Numark in particular), while some didn't sound any better with either (i.e. the Sennheisers). Overall though the E5 seemed crisper and clearer than the Fireye, which tended to muddy the sound a bit of many of the headphones.<br /><br />Which to choose? Listen to the headphones you want to use them on before you buy, if you can - the effectiveness varies considerably depending on the headphone model. Otherwise, you can easily find the E5 for @$20, 1/2 the price of the Fireye Mini. At that price, with a sturdier build, made mostly of metal, with some nice features, I'd go for the E5.
0345803485|3.0|I bought this book as a joke for my friends birthday, she didn't appreciate the joke, but I think I might read it one of these days.
B00B73SUGA|3.0|It is certainly good. But let me be absolutely clear, it is no daredevil dave. Similar in theory but not as good at all.
B005S9ELQ2|1.0|It's always amusing to see how Hollywood distorts reality in the name of entertainment.  This story is so far away from true events it should be billed as fiction with no basis in reality.  Indeed the only reality in this film is there were six American hostages that got out of Iran on a Swiss airline everything else has been totally fabricated right down to Mendez's family life,(his son was actually 17 at the time).  The part Canadians played in actual events is so trivialized that it is insulting.  Just how inaccurate is Argo well the Canadians paid for the airline tickets in the real story just for starters!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I can't say enough about the books and the show...but I couldn't wait for this to come out. Love the DVD copy as well so that I watch it on the go too.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Great action movie. good follow on to the Bourne collection.would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an exciting movie to watch.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|If you haven't seen it, you should. Great  soundtrack too. With the combo pack I can share the laughs.  Makes for a great gift.
B007MDB548|5.0|Keeps the children and grand children busy. very good story. would recommend to anyone looking for some good family entertainment.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Nothing better than having the conclusion to a great film franchise. Obviously it looks and sounds amazing in blu-ray and the price was good.
B000TEPED0|5.0|every track is pretty good.  go ahead and get the album rather than singles.  just discovered this guy in late 2011 and like his style alot.
B003NX76BM|4.0|It was well written and kind of realistic for a practical outdoors type that had been trained.  I was taught about the outdoors and hunting at an early age.  THe mountains were our second home and we taught our girls outdoor things.  camping, shooting,hiking, etc.  ONe girl joined Army one NAvy.  mIght happen!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. I am enjoying taking care of my horse, training her, and competing with her. It is fun for children and adults.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The collection of short stories made this book a quick read. I found myself picking it up for ten minutes here and there and at times reading many stories at a time. This was my first zombie novel and i really enjoyed it. I plan on following this up with max Brooks zombie survival guide.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I usually read romance novels with a bit of mystery and suspence in them, but I have to say, I am so glad I chose to read The Innocent because I loved it. It's 3:15 am right now because I couldn't put the book down. Excellent writer, he kept me guessing the entire time. Just when you think you have it figured out, he comes out of left field with something completely different. I highly reccomend anyone read this book. You won't be let down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  Very challenging always just a little different. I like the change of scenery.  I like the different missions. I play the game every day.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is the next in the series, and it doesn't disappoint.  No spoiler here, but the ending is somewhat unexpected and harsh.  Not sure where GRR's gonna go with it next.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Saw it in the movies. Almost as good on TV with BluRay. Should give lots of enjoyment in years to come.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is the greatest surprise I've found since becoming a Prime member.  These stories generally follow the books and  shorts written by Doyle,  with a modern twist that brings the art of deduction into the 21st  century. I  cannot wait for season three.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|CD arrived early!<br />Music is great.  Can't wait to see this band in person.<br />Harmonies are just wonderful, sounds like they have been<br />playing together for years.  Hopefully this is the first cd or<br />many.
B000NMW6M0|2.0|The cover states &#34;Brad Pitt's-Best Film Performance&#34;-after watching the film I absolutely disagree. While his performance wasn't horrible it definately was not his best. The whole picture kept jumping from various actors that apparently had a part in the relivance of the film but it was unclear what that relivance was? I continued to watch the movie all the way till the end thinking it's gonna all make sense eventually and/or a caption will come up showing how all the various actors were associated with each other but this never happened. Absolutely do not recommend this movie.
B00846F1YW|5.0|is as good as the first one love the puzzle the challenge n the story is interested and fun... don't got nothing more to say
0439321603|5.0|My nerdy wife loved the book, it completes here little creepy collection, whatever gets her off my back is always a 5 start rating!
0789204096|3.0|When they say this is tiny, they mean TINY, 41/4 x 41/2 x 1.  Almost too small to enjoy, but it's Norman Rockwell so it's still fun to peruse.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of if not the best in it's class. Engrossed with this family and am in withdrawal till season 4!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After my girls and friends all recommended the book I decided to read it myself.  It was well worth my time.  I really enjoyed it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|this was a good drama, tommy lee jones dont make any bad movies, at least i havent see any. i like the ending, nice twist.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Very rarely do I come across an artist that makes me put their album on repeat and tell all my friends about....this one did! Her voice is absolutely beautiful and paired with well written and produced songs.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is awful. it fails and then wont let me play. about every other week I must delete it then buy it back.
1449410243|3.0|Just received my three copies. I've ordered three, for myself, my mother and my mother in law. We're all catlovers. This book is funny but borderline rude. I'm a great fan of extreme humor but even for me some of the items of this book are too much...<br />That's why i gave it three stars.<br />Kudo's for amazon's delivery service. Sending it from the states to Holland should take about three months but the books where delivered within a month after ordering.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love this new world.  The water affects so many elements every play is a surprise.  And don't worry about buying those extra weapons. You can get by without them and they are not useful enough to lean on.  Great new level from Rovio brainiacs.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Ok so after some looking around to try and build on of these myself, I finally just bought this on....<br />After reading the reviews i figured it could be a hit or miss situation but when i got mine in the mail and started using it i was very please. Now the screen setup does leave a little to be desired due to being unable to adjust the angle but you can get creative and figure out how to fix that (as I did).  All and all it is a very cool product and as far as im concerned it was worth every penny.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|Big let down. Was not half as good as the first one. I didn't like that the darkness could go outside of silent hill nor the spider made out of artificial parts, pretty lame.
0451232852|1.0|Someone either underpaid the researchers or they just had a grudge against the writer and/or editor. Many, many mistakes and omissions of important historical facts.  The reader who is not familiar with this period in history will not learn a thing.  Boring, boring , boring, very predictable and chock full of characters from mars.  I gave the trilogy a chance and read bk., two, that one was a real insult, I want my money and time back, how does this stuff get published?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A great buy to pass the time or something to wait it out for. Repetitive and easy to grasp. Never have to scratch your head on this one
B00A2H9L2E|3.0|Honestly this could have been done a lot better. It didn't truly follow the game as the ending was wrong from the game and some elements and monsters were wrong. *spoiler* The man eating a human flesh burger and the butcher cutting meat out of a live man were just gross and didn't belong in the Silent Hill world. The mannequin monster didn't make sense and never were girls turned into mannequins. Also the dad died in the game and the detective lived. Here its the opposite. Also the boy character was just an add in. As for being a movie of the third game, it'll have to do. It follows most of the story line of the game.
B000EULJLU|2.0|The quality of the CD I recieved was so bad that I am unable to listen to the last (3) songs on the album
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read.  Chris was certainly a true American hero!  Book is action packed and takes you right onto the battle field.  I now have a great appreciation for the Navy SEAL Teams and particularly for the snipers.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I mostly use my laptop for my emails, but the Fire is a nice portable device that I can take anywhere so this app is great. The few times I've gone anywhere and have taken the Fire it's been nice checking to see if there's anything important in my email.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This band has evolved beyond beyond. You don't get together after decades and do this...its not humanly possible.....Plants voice is richer than ever, Page flys all over the frets...JP on bass smashes it and on keyboards the Zep mystique encompasses the listener. And the Bonham kid....John Henry must be proud.....Jason has the thunder of his dad ....and more. First there were the Beatles, who in 10 years set the standard, but them came Zep, who in 10 years took Rock to a height that seems unreachable. It kind of ended with Zep....nobody has compared since.<br />Celebration Day proves that LZ is more powerful than ever. They are not old, they have not mellowed...they just effortlessly ROCK.<br />I play Kashmir like 10 times a day!<br />They are due for like a 5 city tour...c'mon guys ....something...just a live jam from Jimmy's living room...something?
B007SGM084|5.0|I was skeptical about these books to start with!! But they were definitely an escape from reality!!<br />And they were the boost to my libido!!
B008BGNMZU|3.0|Not what I am use to from Fourplay, could have been better. I have just about all of Fourplays cd's, this is just a little off the usual.  I will buy more of their music
1451695195|5.0|This book is so very different from the previous books about visiting Heaven, yet everyone&#34;s experience seems to be different and yet similar in some small aspects.  Coming from a physician, it gives more information about the physical issues and in the light of being away from his earthly body, it gives credence to the powerful and awesomeness of how God works in His wondrous ways.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|There are still some problems with the synchronization of the audio and visual, but all in all a big improvement to the second and third episodes!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love his voice and whether he sings in English or some other language it makes my heart soar, so I heartily recommend this CD.
0062238868|5.0|This book kept me glued to the couch for 3 days. Couldn't put it down. A gripping tale of combat in Iraq. I loved how plain spoken Chris Kyle is. He told it as he saw it. Too bad this hero died at the hands of another ex-soldier. He could have accomplished so much more.
1595825045|4.0|This book really gives great insight into the making of an animated series. The only problem is that I feel they should have split it into two volumes to fully encompass everything.
0547569653|5.0|1a3<br /><br />When you think of this worlds \\"super runners\\" Scott Jurek's name has a good chance of being on that list.  He came on the radar in 1999 when he took first place in a 100 mile run over the old Gold Rush Trails in California and continued to take first in that run for the next seven years.  Scott had broke records,  twice won the Badwater 135 mile  Ultramarathon, and set an American record of 165.7 miles in 24 hours.<br /><br />  So who is Scott and what makes him run?<br /><br />Scott grew up in a \\"meat and potatoes family\\" with a desire to run - but not always a passion for it.  In fact he hated running.  As he grew to adult he went to an all plant-based diet and worked his way to ultra running.  Scott's story is an inspiration to anyone who has a dream to better themselves and for whatever reason felt it was impossible to reach their goals.<br /><br />For the last year I have had this desire to learn how to run.  I don't know why or where it came from other than the fact that runners have great stamina, I admire their dedication and dare I say it looks like fun?  Scott's story was really impressive to listen to.  His story is engaging, he is down to earth and funny.  You do not need to be some sort of fitness guru to enjoy this book and come out the other side with a lot of knowledge on running and a bit of inspiration to boot.<br /><br />At the end of the audio he shares some yummy sounding vegan recipes that I plan to try.<br /><br />Lentil-Mushroom Burgers<br /><br />1.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers is by far the best movie of the summer. Rarely do we get the opportunity to see movies with so many spectacular action figures. The fight scenes are phenomenon and exciting with dashing colors and explosions. I was so excited to see this movie when it came out. The movie starts with an attack from an alternate universe who wants to destroy the world. The Avengers must come together to save the world with their unique skills. The challenge with bringing so much talent together, is figuring out how to tame their massive egos.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about how well the action is sequenced together. The creativity with the characters costumes are so fantastic. This is a masterpiece and to see some of the most outstanding figures working together, makes this a must see film! Great experience for children of all ages!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I was recommended this book after reading the Hungary games and Divergent. At first it was really hard to picture what was going on and what Thomas was experiencing after he left &#34;the box&#34; but I really enjoyed it and finished it within a few days. I'm excited to read the sequel and would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Expectations ,for me, are always lower for the second book in a series. Catching Fire caught me at page one and held me to the end. leaving me anxious for more.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Excellent,  Excellent!  One of the best shows ever made!  Great story lines and excellent acting by both guys!  WOW, I was sorry it ended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A &#34;Young Adult&#34; novel? I began this book only to see what all the fuss was about, especially coming from &#34;Regular' adults. One chapter in I thought - WOW - forget genre, just let me keep reading. I'll never understand the mind of the writer, in terms of where concepts like The Hunger Games are formed, but I sure am glad Ms Collins has such a mind. Never disappointed in a single word.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was a good movie but I guess since it received Best Picture, I expected more.  This isn't the first time that a movie has received the highest award when I thought another actually deserved it and I'm sure it will happen again in the years to come.  I think Ben Affleck did a good job directing it.  It seems, with time, he has developed his talents not just with his acting but in other aspects of the movie industry.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THe only regret I have about Mockingjay is that the series is over. A worthy third to the series, with enough new elements to have its own compelling heartbeat.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|The third edition of this book brings in recent examples and relevant situations to explain concepts. This book helps you to think about what you are doing right and what to improve on. Principled negotiation with an understanding of all parties BATNA should be the start to any negotiation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So much fun I AM Loving it. I play it thought out the day... this and Sims and free cell I'm quite busy.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|This movie was a disappointment. It had lots of bad language and immoral innuendo. It is definitely not a movie for children.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|How do I update the app because all its telling me is the stupid details and not how to go to the next stage dummies
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing. It is a little challenging sometime but other than that it's pretty cool. It does glitch ALOT and when you try to get the different letters it says your time is up. So hope you enjoy the game:)
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|One of my favorite all time Zeppelin albums. Every song on the album a classic hit that stands the test of time & never seems to grow old!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Got to play daily.  We are addicted to this game.  Fun for all ages.  Great updated to play.  Love it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved all 3 books books.  They were all very graphic and detailed.  The books made you feel like it was happening to you and it also taught this old dog new tricks.  This books also reminds us that life is short and we should never take our love ones for granted.  If there was a fourth book i would read it. Great series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It keeps you on the edge until the end. I did not like the ending but that is just me. The style of writing was unique and the author really gives a good description of the characters that you can picture them as they are. Keep reading, you will be in for a twist and turn ride.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I can honestly say that this book has and is going to change my life. My husbands too. We recently was deceived by a family member and this book has given me a different way of thinking about it.  Its weird but i felt an instant weight lifted off my shoulders. Highly recommend.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille has pulled together another excellent, well researched action novel featuring John Corey and Kate Mayfield.  This one takes place in Yemen and starts off with a bang as &#34;The Panther&#34; slits the throats of a group of Belgian tourists.  As always, John and Kate find themselves in the thick of things in Sana'a, Aden, and Magrib and the action comes fast and furious.<br /><br />As is typical with DeMille novels, the reader is never sure which side of the fence many of the characters fall on (good or evil); this book is no exception.  The only thing one can count on is that John Corey is always the smartest guy in the room.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't get enough of this series...please, please make more!  Very classy, accurate for the era, like eating a wonderful dessert.
0307476464|5.0|The book is very well done.<br />The plot pulls you in, and it is hard to put down.<br />It reads fairly quickly, and is well worth the time.<br />My first Murakami book, and I'll have to read more of this author.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book contains romance, love, history, geography, and all the stages of life a man goes through.  It is centered in France, but can be applied to any country.
B009XEE0DW|4.0|I'm a fan and follower of this extraordinary French singer from the great \\"Live In Bercy\\" getting all their albums to date. The last of them \\"Bleu Noir\\" was the first to disappoint to me with music and arrangements reminiscent Lady Gaga, completely out of her famous style, it is likely the cause of the break behind Mylene strongman Laurent Boutonnat. In this new album Laurent is back. I have to confess that the first time I heard the album I felt very disappointed again, I felt it very weak, uninspired and very superficial. But again decided to listen more attentively and found that it really is not that bad and one reason is that I found to Mylene that i love until the fourth track. Go back a little to early but with new elements and a bit darker. My favorite songs: \\"Tu Ne Le Dis Pas\\" with great melody, great vocals, and the distinctive sweet and lovely voice of Mylene with great arrangements by Laurent, the next track \\"Love Dance\\" (if she misspronounces the English, i think is the least important, has a French accent that gives a special charm to this very good song), \\"J'ai essayé De Vivre ..\\" and \\"A Force De ..\\". Definitely not the best album of Mylene who at 52 age remains very beautiful, but it´s much better that \\"Bleu Noir\\". Compared to previous works, i will put it to the height of \\"Avant que l'Ombre\\". Rated: initially thought two and a half stars but finally convinced me and I give 4. And for those that are disqualifying give her a chance and listen the album more carefully.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Went to see this in a theater during a rainy afternoon and had low expectations. What a surprise to find this gem! Very good actors, a plausible story line and a lot of fun color and sounds of India. I have recommended this to many of my friends and relatives, and they all love it. However, you should be at least 45 to appreciate the film (imo). No violence nor overt sexuality, but really keeps your attention. Have given it as a gift to many and feedback was always very positive. Ends on a positive note without unrealistic exuberance. A great find!
1603580557|5.0|It's written in plain English with great examples that a dummy like me can understand. I wish I had known about this when I was younger just so I could have majored in it.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|I love zombie movies - all kinds.  Plus I love the pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.  They're always so funny together.  I actually didn't like this movie the first time I saw it, but it grew on me after I watched it a second time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I absolutely love this show and cannot wait to see the new episodes each week!  The plot is great and the characters are completely believable!  I get completely drawn in in each episode and am left with the sad realization that I have to wait another week for the next episode to come out.  Who knew the zombie apocolypse could be so compelling?
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of fiction reading. I love non-fiction like this book!  Mr. Gladwell is a gifted storyteller. I can't wait to read more of his books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like it because  you can run really fast if you get something it is better than the first one.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Supposedly, Wintersun's music is designed to &#34;make you feel like you're floating in space&#34;; not every song does that, but they're all fantastic nonetheless.<br /><br />Varying, sometimes within the same song, between power metal, melodic death metal and folk metal, the songs feel familiar in the best way. Powerful riffs bring to mind some of the best of the bands I've loved for years, while new twists (particularly in the ever-varied vocals) are new delights.<br /><br />The first track, &#34;Beyond The Dark Sun&#34;, is my clear favorite, but there aren't any songs on the album I don't love and that's a rare thing.
1476729719|4.0|Within the intense and upsetting plot of a school shooting, the reader finds a broken mother-daughter relationship, a teen learning the price to pay for giving up oneself, and a boy crying out for help to no avail. The story is told by taking the reader back and forth in time to reveal the events leading up to the shooting. The author does not leave the reader questioning the guilt of the bullied shooter, but she does create doubt that we know the whole truth. Throughout the story, I changed from hating the shooter, to feeling extreme sympathy for him. I found within the book a possibly unintended call to be more aware of the effects of bullying whether as a friend, teacher, or parent. While this book was easy and interesting to read, it left me feeling unsettled and a bit disturbed. If you are looking for a feel-good story, this novel will not satisfy. If you are in search of a thought-provoking, potentially realistic story of the hardships of making it through the high school years, this is the right book.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|We rented this when our grandchildren were here.  Although it's not something we would choose on our own, they loved it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really fun. I really like it. It gets sort of boring after a while though. Could be a little more interesting.
B00942G4UA|5.0|This film is very informative about the sources of our food and the way the food market it manipulated by the government.
B00340LM8C|4.0|Good twist but not fully hidden.  Gary Grant was great as usual.  Grace Kelly definitely the classic beauty but overplayed slightly.  Her mom was the best character though.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I only heard the singles from the earlier album, and picked this one up based on the strength of the released singles, especially 'When I was Your Man'. Different styles get focus on multiple songs and Mars handles it all supremely well.
B002O5M4SA|2.0|after placing this review, I started the movie again so see if I messed up at the beginning which I did, afyter hitting play movie it goes to giving you the opportunity to choose between the two and indeed it is extended prior to her food delivery there is an additional footage of them together at work, refreshing and I truly apologize for my quick remark.<br />I do see that there is a DVD European uncut version, does anybody know possibly if there is a difference, I believe the extended was about 20 minutes longer as well.<br /><br />I purchased this Blu Ray thinking it had a different ending to the original I already owned. Well, the cover is the only difference between these movies from the one I already owned.<br />The only reason i am giving this a two stars is for the reviewer that made me think and believe this had a different ending. I do hate when the covers are exchange differently but still the same production.<br />This is my warning to anybody that already owns the original movie, you will not get a second of difference between them, except for the different cover.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The story of Lisbeth Salander is very interesting.  The book sometimes slows down too much, like the first book, when it gets into the business end of Mr. Blomkvist. magazine.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|There isn't a song on this album that I don't like. It's great! And they don't all sound the same, which you don't find a lot of in todays music.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I loved all the suspense in the story line, it always kept you guessing.  I'm glad I didn't see the movie first because it would have wrecked the ending.  I can't wait to see the movie now to see how well they showed some of the more interesting events and people in the story.  I have enjoyed every Dennis Lehane book that I have read.
B009TO99TG|5.0|took awhile to get it but , well worth the wait.great quality<br />great price,$$ cant beleave how cheep it was$$
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I work in the hospitality business and this collection is a blast, I just love Manuel saying &#34;queeeeeee???&#34;, the quality of these dvd's is very good, as the title says, it's remastered so you'll get an improved version of the original, I guarantee several hours of raw entertainment.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This has always been my by far the best game I've ever played other than minecraft, so I give it 5 out of 5.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite card games.  I spend hours playing it on a weekly basis and enjoy each time.  Found it to be fun and easy to play.  It is relaxing to play too.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This is fabulous. When I bought it, I thought it was just a case that was also a charger. But it actually stores a double charge in it, so if you talk on the phone for 4 hours a day, you could only charge on the weekends.  The cord doesn't fit very snugly, but it seems to work just fine.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|Found that this is a most helpful beneficial tool for senior citizens with the start of memory lost.  It keeps their thinking and solving process working.  It gives one a good feeling when he/she has completed the puzzle.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like temple run better because there is so much more you can do. Subway suffers is exactly like temple run[[ASIN:B00B2V66VS Temple Run 2]], download this instead, i love it
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|what a great movie I was thinking this movie was going to be a little slow and boring from the previews and i was very wrong this is a really attention grabbing movie and who dosnt love denzel what an amazing actor!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|take primer, add a dash of blade runner noir but minus the '80s almost-optimistic neon, amd you have looper. a little dash of the 13th floor is in there with the ending, but bottom line: fun mix of not-quite-sci-fi, action noir.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Good movie and would recommend it for others for viewing. Had a good story line and was well acted out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Don't hesitate on this game. Its fun, it works great, and it remains a challenge. I am always quick to delete a game if I dont like it,but not this one. Its a keeper.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|It  did not work on my kindle fire.<br />Also it is no longer working efficiently on my XP desk top
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This bond movie has all the prerequisites for a great action movie.  The villain is sinister and the women are gorgeous.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Not a huge hip-hop / rap fan but this album is virtually flawless - intriguing from start to finish with no clunkers.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was soo good. I couldnt put this book down and i was sad when it was over then i found out there was another one coming. I cant wait!!! These are the kind of books that i never want to end. You will not be disappointed!!!!
1451695195|4.0|I think this man must have gone to the place that is before heaven.  Not the gates but even before that.  It was very interesting to read his account.  God being a God of Love is so true.  As humans it is hard to believe that we are all God's favorites.  The feeling of oneness in love and being an intricate part of things moving in and out of us not around I would say is right on.  Sorry he had to go through a lot of pain but I would say it was definately worth it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cant say enough great things about this book. I fell totally in love with the characters!!! I couldnt put this book down. You will NOT be disappointed!!!
B007MDB6L0|4.0|I am a fan of clean family fun.  This movie is a good example of a film that can watched a few times without encouraging negative behavior/vocabulary or sassy attitude.  I love the clever innocence of it.  Yea for Tinkerbelle!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome, I brought it on a whim because I was bored and I have not been bored since. It's very addictive x
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game will have you coming back for more.  It is challenging, gets one thinking.<br />If at first you don't succeed.....
B005IQZB14|1.0|This is not my chosen genre in reading.  I find these books boring and the writers a little self-absorbed.  If you enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love this may be a good choice for you.
B0099114WO|5.0|Extra Great Movie for any couple,it realy shows you how you've lost that loven feeling,i think its just great,but I like both that plays in it too!!
B0039LDICE|4.0|Main characters in this book are a single mother with a young son and her relationship with her mother.  The daughter fears that her mother is going senile but the mother begins to write the story of her life and hands chapters to the daughter to read.  The unfolding plot is very suspenseful when the mother turns out to be someone that has a huge secret to tell.  A bit of historical fiction, relationship twists, and drama.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is a very well made case for the money. I have been using it for a few months now and hardly any ware at all. It's a good product, and you won't be disappointed.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this for my five year old daughter and she loves it!! It is not too scary for the little ones and has lots of laughs for all ages. Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Who ever made this game is awesome. There are missions a shop for upgrades, skip missions an  even has world tours first it was just subway surfers now it was subway surfers ny then Rio now Rome congrats on who ever made this game.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|OK,..I only started watching the show this year... Even though its now in its FIFTH season. I LOVE it.. the dry wit, the unusual way the team solves the crimes. I've been watching it on TNT.. but then they mess up their schedule & I 'miss' an episode, or the wrong thing is scheduled!!!<br /><br />So my solution was to jump onto ROKU & buy 1 episode at a time via Amazon Instant Video's :)<br />I'm now watching the 3rd season!! Will be VERY interested to see if??:<br />1. How/when? will they get RedJohn?<br />2. Will a romance finally develop between Lisbon & Jane?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I am not sure I would say this is the years &#34;Best Picture.&#34; However the story was interesting. I lived through those times. I believed the story avoided pointing its finger at the extremist Islamic government which had taking over Iran. It was a vicious time where there was no rule of law for innocent Iranian citizens.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|too hard to follow  did not enjoy this game deleted it off my Kindle.  Thank you for letting me try
B004E547D8|5.0|This film is a good story filled with action, action, and more action. I have wanted to see it since it arrived in theaters, but I didn't get a chance until it arrived from Amazon on Blu-ray. Well worth the wait.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Perfectly written. Shows how linked together a small town really is. Every character is relatable and you always want to know what's going to happen next. You also come to see how one life can affect so many others in various ways.
1455113549|4.0|I don't believe anyone in our book club saw the ending coming!  We liked the book but not the family, very<br />dysfunctional.  Most wanted Jacob to be innocent of the crime but the blood on the bathing suit made them<br />believe he was guilt.  Probably the best book discussion we have had in a long time.  It's a book we will<br />remember for a long time.<br />  Pat Sibley
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I really enjoyed the different stories that were going on at the same time.  The way they played out was well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the different world tours:NY, Rio, and Rome they are so awsome you should really get this FREE app!
B009YX02T8|5.0|Love all the tunes - they are awesome.  It's easy to picture what was happening in the movie for each song too.  Lots of fun!
B00992CF6W|1.0|so dont buy it it s not minecraft it wontngo  dark r no creepers<br />and all u do is build and there s no creepers
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for its excitement and an introduction to a lifestyle very foreign to most of us. It's not what I'd call a &#34;serious&#34; film, but it's very skillfully made entertainment for those seeking action, violence, and a taste of the drug culture. It's the first movie I've seen with alternate endings, which I understand is now in vogue.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|You will talk about this movie to friends. Awesome edge of your seat thriller. Should have heard more about this-??
B004SCN2F6|2.0|I wanted to love this game, but I just couldn't forgive all the bugs present in the game.<br /><br />First, while you can go to your Status screen, and then to the Factions screen to see your standing with each faction, the Faction screen doesn't tell you which factions are currently at war with each other. That's kind of vital information, because attacking a faction that is allied with your own will cause you to lose standing in your own faction. Secondly, if you are trying to gain standing with your faction, and start a contract for them, your faction will happily send you off to attack one of their own allies. Finishing this contact will cause you to lose standing with the faction you did it for!<br /><br />Third, the ship upgrade screen is buggy. I finally reached legendary hero with House Thulun, and got the Thulun Flagship. Thulun Prime has 5 upgrades available, I have over $300,000 in money to spend, and the upgrades I want have the &#34;View&#34; button grayed out, so I can't select them. They are normal upgrades, with no pre-requisites, it just won't let me select them at all. What's absurd is there are upgrades that have pre-requisites that I don't have, that I CAN look at by clicking the &#34;View&#34; button, but the &#34;Purchase&#34; button is grayed out because I don't meet the pre-requisite! The same upgrades I had on my Thulun Longbow, I couldn't buy for my Thulun Flagship, because of this really stupid bug. I feel like I got cheated at the end of the game, after getting the best ship House Thulun had to offer.<br /><br />Also I didn't like two other points of the game:<br /><br />I feel that Water-Fuel is used way too fast, even on the lowest difficulty setting. I have found that it's not really worth doing contract at all, it's faster and easier to gain money and faction standing waiting for the House you want to work for to declare war on another House, and then blockading the enemy house. Where with a Contract you gain a small amount of money and a small amount of standing by wasting a ton of Water-Fuel flying across the cosmos, Blockading gives you a huge amount of money and a huge amount of standing with little Water-Fuel expended. This seemed kind of odd to me.<br /><br />There isn't any storyline at all from what I can tell, and after reaching legendary hero with a house and getting the best ship I could get, I didn't see the point of playing the game anymore. What is there to do?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Read!! Wonderful book. Loved the story. Her first two books were a good start to this one, but this is the best of hers by far.
B009A9EPLM|4.0|A wonderful blend of music that would have been played at the time.  Although it's not as good as The Civil War soundtrack (Ken Burns, 1987), there are beautiful melodies in the classical mode.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked the inside story of becoming a seal, the years of combat & how Mr. Kyle balanced duty & family.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|I thought it was going to be a better movie. It was okay, wouldn't watch it for a 2nd time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read the book after the Oscars.  It reads much more realistic and enjoyable for me knowing who played in the movie.  I plan to see the movie.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|My attention wasn't continuous on the movie so I'm giving it 3 stars, having said this, I believe it would be a 4 star movie for kids.
0307719219|3.0|Economics is an imprecise science as we all know, particularly today as our nation struggles through its deadlocked debate over our fiscal mess.  Answers to simple questions are complicated.  How much public spending is right?  How should our spending be paid for?  How much debt can our country afford?  How can we restore growth to the economy?  Answers to these questions will surely affect the pace of growth in our economy and have a direct impact on the level of our country's abundance and the ability of our citizens to share in that abundance.<br /><br />Even bigger questions lie beneath the surface of those which we now face.  What causes economies to grow?  What causes economies to drift or flounder?  Are there any central defects in social and political organization that retard or prevent economic growth?  Are there any common factors that are almost invariably associated with economic prosperity?  This book, co-authored by two of the country's finest economists, takes on these issues and searches for the common answers across every continent and more than two thousand years of economic history.  This is a formidable job, requiring a deep understanding of dozens of examples of vastly different political and economic systems.<br /><br />The central finding in this book is remarkably clear and relatively obvious: sustained growth requires, first, inclusive political systems, in which dissent can be heard and in which national leaders are subject to the will of the people and second, inclusive economic systems, in which every citizen has a chance to succeed and in which innovation and disruptive technological advances are encouraged.  Conversely, political systems that are exclusive, with power centralized in few hands, are directly damaging to growth.  Few, if any, monarchs or dictators are interested in governing nations in which its citizens hope for change.  The economic systems associated with exclusionary political systems are extractive in nature.  They extract the economic value of labor from the population and use this value to sustain their political goals which specifically are opposed to change.<br /><br />The scope and consistency of these lessons are illustrated throughout the book in many, many examples.  While the authors convinced me that open societies and open economic systems are essential to initiate and maintain growth, by the fifth or fiftieth example of this I began to lose interest.  Although the authors point to sub-Saharan Africa as an illustration of the central thesis of the book, I had two problems with this.  First, I found the examples of African countries and tribes that have descended into corruption and economic decay to be repetitive and unnecessarily complicated.  Second, the fact is that growth in sub-Saharan Africa is now surging and the political systems, which all seemed to be despotic according to the authors, are moving increasingly towards democracy.  In fact, Africa may be an example of a region that had been stalled by decadent political and economic systems, including slavery, but are now remodeling and becoming far more vibrant.<br /><br />In general, however, I found the central lessons of the book to be well argued and firmly supported by many good examples but the extensive repetition of the argument was, for me, unnecessary.  Furthermore, there is one glaring exception to the dogma of this book: China, with its ruthlessly exclusive political system and its extractive economy.  China's growth, which has been arguably the most explosive and rapid of any country in the past century, seems a direct contradiction to the author's central arguments.  This contradiction is explained by the authors to be only a temporary phenomenon.  It is, in their opinion, unsustainable and will result in a failed economy over time.  Maybe, but this exception requires far more thought and explanation than only a few pages in a 460 page book.<br /><br />There is much of interest in this book, which tackles a tangled but crucially important subject.  However, I would have liked the book to be either more concise, without the repetition of essentially the same argument, or more probing, dealing more comprehensively with examples that defy the central dogma of the book.

B009SJ46EA|1.0|The portrayal of the Catholic Church in American Horror Story : Asylum is insulting, slanted, and twist. The priests are nun running the asylum are portrayed as perverts, hypocrites, and evildoers. And it tries to hide this bigotry under the guise of a horror genre set in the past. Moreover, the twisted imagery of Catholic symbols, contorting them into icons of evil, turned my stomach. This is just another example of the hypocrisy of Hollywood writers that bigotry is wrong unless it aimed at a majority group such as Christians. Portrayal of other religious or groups in this manner would never be permitted to be aired, so why should this form of anti-Catholic bigotry be tolerated. Do not waste your money on this trash. And if it costs you nothing to watch an episode, don't watch an episode out of protest. Do not tolerate bigotry of any form in any medium.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Being a Kung Fu flick fan that I am, I was excited when seeing previews on TV.  Wasn't able to see it in theaters, but was excited when it was available on video.  When I saw who handled it I thought \\"Aww S***!  Here we go.\\".  It's the RZA's Homage to the classic Kung Fu flicks He loves.  This could be just be me, but I saw elements of Ninja Scroll in this flick.<br /><br />I'll try to break this review down to the best of my abilities.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />The characters were very creative. RZA is the skilled village black smith with story narration.  Russel Crowe as Mr. Knife was quite amusing.  His weapons were neat.  Lucy Lui owns/owns a brothel, but her true identity & intentions is reveiled towards the end.  Former wrestling star David Bautista as Brass Body.  Need I say more?  Rick Yune as X-Blade, a walking swiss army knife, so to speak.  Plus a few more.<br /><br />The action was incredible.  At times, over the top with its numerous graphic scenes.  If all you care about is action, this movie would be up your alley.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />The plot.  Though there was one, it was scattered.  Highly unorganized.<br /><br />Though this movie was capturing the spirit of the kung fu genre, it really isn't a Kung Fu movie.  The fight scenes didn't really display much kung fu in my opinion. The fight scenes were over the top, but not really kung fu.  I can see where kung fu fans had a hard time with this.<br /><br />The editing, how can I put this, was SLOPPY.  What little kung fu that was displayed, was stunted due to the editing.<br />Fast editing cuts work, if done right.  At times, it made the movie look like a complete mess.<br /><br />Then there's the RZA.  If he plans to star in a movie he directs, I would hope he'd spend extra time on his choreography in the future.  His fighting, or lack there of, was a kiddy pool filled with misery.  To make it worse, they tried to hide his handicap with special effects.<br /><br />I don't how well it would've done without Tarantino's name slapped on it, but all and all I did enjoy the movie.  It's worth a watch.  RZA pays his respects to Kung Fu flicks in his own vision.  I have no issues adding it to my collection.  That being said I would strongly advise you rent it before you purchase it.ould've done without Tarantino's name slapped on it, but all and all I did enjoy the movie.  It's worth a watch.

0811870413|5.0|For twenty years I'd been hoping to achieve the results at home that I found in my local food coop: sourdough with a crackling crust, light in the hand, bursting with holes and rife with flavor.  This beautiful book, complete with simple black and white photos that show you each step, will enable you to achieve this.  I'm so glad I purchased this book.  Now, no matter where I travel, I can always be assured of my sourdough loaves.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It glitches a lot I only played the game once and it stopped work after that one time. I would not reccomend this to a friend on this device.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think that this is the best book i have ever read. and i have read a lot books and i am only 8 years old and a nother good book is called Holes.<br />i think you shoud read both of them because thay are both such  good books and in both you might start to cry about somthing or just laugh out loud but you should just enjoy. so if you do read the books i am talking about then enjoy them.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|No glamour, pretentions, or fluff.  Reality is profound in its simplest form, when it is honest and truthful.  A fast read that is hard to put down.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I first saw Led Zeppelin live in July, 1969 at the Atlanta International Pop Festival.  I've been a fan ever since.  Enough has been written about them to fill a library.  They are without a doubt one of the top five rock and roll bands in all of recorded history.  Many would say the &#34;best&#34;.  This concert was as good as it gets considering their edge that youth brought has since passed, but replaced by a confidence and stage presence few will ever attain. Sound quality is excellent. An entertainment bargain for any fan of classic and timeless rock and roll.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book. It takes a lot for me to really sit and read a good story. Sky has you from the first page. I tell everyone about it. Great writter to. I'm about to start Slammed,  looks good to.  Slammed was very good too.  :)
B003VANOFY|2.0|The drivers for this have caused me so many BSODs and Photoshop crashes on Windows 7 64bit that it isn't even funny. Was Logitech even trying? Also it constantly loses signal. The box says \\"PCs may cause interference\\". Well if that's the case what business does it have being made for PC? Sometimes pressing the power button on the headset and waiting forever won't be enough; you'll have to unplug and replug in the wireless adapter or possibly even restart your PC! Clearly something that belongs in the Windows XP days and I can't recommend anyone buy this.<br /><br />Stay clear of this one and buy a headset from a different manufacturer.
B001AITGWE|4.0|Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall portray the struggles of two people on the edge struggling to remain standing even though the world around them symbolically is crumbling down.Yes, there are scenes of violence in the movie but these are reflection of life in a tough neighborhood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun exciting and entertaining I would highly recommended this game for horse lovers and anyone else who cares or is interested in horses
B008Q0D4MW|5.0|The full range of elements that make a movie exceptionl are found in Barry London. Acting,cinematography,music,intelligent and crisp dialogue,set and decors... all breathtakingly beautiful!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an absolutely terrific game that makes you excited about playing it. It is one of those games that you just can't put down. It would be even better if in the world tour they visited Jamaica. Overall I g I've this game a 5 star rating and good job to the greatest of the game. Subway Surfers rock!!!!!!.
B00846REIS|4.0|The story was good but I was left with too many questions. I hope the sequels will shed some light on them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game I so love horses so this is like my dream game love it love it love it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put it down, great page turner! Could not believe how it all played out. Would recommend this to anyone!
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is a lot of fun! everyone should try it! keeps you busy for sure!! I give it five stars!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of witches  Is an amazing book I so look forward to reading the next one and then the third
B008OOYALE|5.0|I rate this most wonderful game a five. why? because its like you feel like your reallllllly feeding and taking care of of a reall dragon.  although the title doesn't match this game deserves s five. Do you not agree!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!
030758836X|3.0|This was a highly entertaining book. It's been a while since I've read a book that I couldn't put down. Which is not to say that it was incredible literature, it isn't. The story is clever and the characters are pretty well drawn, but for such an ambitious story line I felt the characters needed to better fleshed out to be believable. I also think some minor characters were highly unbelievable in their supporting roles (the twin sister who goes from analyst job to part bar-owner and just pops up supportively as a story device.) I did like the staging of the story in how the recession impacts the lives of the characters and their communities and drives events in the book.<br /><br />The strange thing about this book is that it started off with really good writing but as the storyline intensified, the writing went downhill. My impression at the end of the book went from \\"This is good novel\\" to \\"This will make a good Lifetime channel movie,\\" and I don't mean this is a bad way necessarily. For all that though, it delivered on the fundamental duty of a novel; I was entertained and engaged in the story to the point where I had to force myself not to turn to the end just to find out what happens.<br /><br />Oh, and as for the ending, I know many people thought it was anti-climatic and seemed rushed, but I quite liked the ending. It was quite gothic, in a quietly horrifying way.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love working the puzzles, this offers a good choice of puzzles . Verry happy with it :-)<br />I woould suggest this to any of my puzzle doing friends.
159420411X|5.0|The author has an approach to the information theory following the last descoveries in this field.<br />Particularly he tries to understand the financial questions by a view which is in according to the new trends.<br />In fact the microeconomics leaves the model of perfect information of Hayek and Arrow for accepting the Bayes theorem.<br />The applications of this result are related to the world of sport, particularly to the base-ball.<br />Other models born about the weather predictions, the earth-quakes, in general the phenomena around the chaos theory.<br />The explications are surely difficult, but they are coherent with the new challenges of the general theory.
B00BHMF578|5.0|From the opening to the end you are grabbed by this amazing film. My stomach churned and I laughed and cried. No other movie has even come close to this one. Must See.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a well-written, well-acted, interesting story arc.  Directing and music are excellent.<br />High-quality sci-fi drama that gets better throughout the season.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Whle there was enough crash scenes for the kids we adults liked the clever scenes and the overall plot. Kept me in the story from start to finish.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Interesting story. Not too romantic just a good story line. Skimmed thru some paragraphs that were drawn out but good read.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|The story just didn't flow well. I live near St.Petersbugh Fl and the paper does stories about Scientology. The nude scene was overdone and I am not sure it added anything except shock to the movie plot. PSH acting was geat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I didn't think this game would interest me in the least, but, I was bored and downloaded it, now I catch myself playing everyday, it's a game that you don't have to stress over.  I love it!
159448385X|5.0|I never thought a man could write from a woman's perspective, but Hosseini made me rethink that notion. I have used this book in my Comparative World Women's course at the university level with great success. While the book is an enjoyable read that inspires many questions of Afghanistan's history and culture, the last 30+ pages suffer from a shift in literary voice and a lack of character development that was beautifully crafted earlier in the novel. It seems as though the end was an afterthought to create a more appealing conclusion reminiscent of the addition to the movie, _The Piano_. This magnificent story actually ends in the soccer stadium with Mariam's epiphany of motherhood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game its supper fun but it gets harder as you go i think you guys will in joy yhe game
B001CDD84Y|4.0|Who would not like to instantly be wherever their thoughts and dreams take them. Very good PG (some violence) entertainment, and Samuel L. Jackson plays another great bad guy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its like temple run its really fun but you have to get so much coins to get a  character or board.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Still in the early stages and learning. Wish I could pay one price and be done rather than being asked to buy more things all of the time.
B00136NUG6|4.0|Earth Wind & Fire had a surprising number of hits over the years, many of which are instantly recognizable. This is a great collection, especially for the casual fan.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works just fine, but I didn't keep it because I didn't use it that much and I needed more room on the Kindle for my Game of Thrones downloads.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My budget does not allow me to have cable and my inadequate attena does not pick up PBS.  I was thrilled to be able to visit Downton Abbey again.  I had not seen it since the very fist episodes aired.  This free episode was extremely good.  I had no problems or complaints with the delivery of the product.  I enjoyed this version very much and I hope to see more in the future!  Thanks for the opportunity to get caught up in this fantastic show once again!
0061478784|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is well worth the read! It is an amazing book and im proud to have it on my shelf!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, is loads of fun and a great way to pass time.<br />You can connect with Facebook and go up against your friends to try and beat their highest score.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm rating this app 4 stars because the first temple run ran more smoothly and it was a little easier to move side to side. The first one was more about getting coins and the second one you're mostly just trying to stay alive over all. Besides some minor dents its a pretty good game with good intensions. I recommend this game to anyone who liked the first.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like this game alot hiccup Chubb  h uhh Vic. Such civic civic Vic tree civic chuck vicinity hubbub bkhiigj
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|At times the movie played out as I remember reading it and seeing it inside my brain really playing out.  The Joker....AMAZING.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very good.gave you lots to think about.makes me want to read it again.I would recommend it for someone else to read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I must say the first half of the book was great! But by the end the author made a victim out of the cheating husband and went the psycho, \\"fatal attraction\\" route.  I guess its a good read I was hoping for there to be more of a romantic feeling in the end.  I had high hopes for this book but i was overall disappointed. :/
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I first read this book I was just amazed at how the author made Charlie's diary seem so simple. Like if he's REALLY  writing a diary entry. Not overdoing it at all.  And as a teenager myself, I was surprised at how I relate to Charlie so much. He's an amazing character himself,though.<br /><br /> I absolutely love this book. I cannot wait to watch the movie. It's official. This is my favorite book of the year. I hope the author keeps the amazing work up. 5 stars all the way!!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I received it quickly however I will update my review because I am in the process of returning the DVD
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game for any age but the game downloads New software released in the game but I can tell you that subway surfers is a good game
B004QX07G4|2.0|I am not quite sure why I ordered this book, except that I enjoy Ellyn.  It was pretty mindless but kept me somewhat entertained on t he elliptical at the gym.
B005LAIH54|1.0|I loved this movie. However...they will not sell THE NORMAL DIGITAL COPY. CAN'T EVEN RENT IT. (This reminds me of an old saying: \\"Another way to ruin a movie income: \\"PLAY GAMES WITH WOULD BE BUYERS!\\"\\" Hear that? I rented the first time....just to see it. And was ready to buy the digital copy.!!!!???????Hello....Money to make here....<br /><br />When and if it does come to amazon instant video, I refuse to rent/purchase any rights to it.<br /> They let us rent/purchase this video here on amazon when it was new/PREVIEWING. Now because we liked it and gave it a good review...they have stripped it from digital viewing or purchase.<br /><br />This and this alone grants this movie a review as: hollywood money making garbage. Pure hollywood garbage.<br />I would have purchased digital when I had the chance.  We showed them in previewing it was good...Gave our honest opinions? Now this...C'mon........C'MON...........c'mon......c'MON!
B007SGM084|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE THAT READ IT SAID IT WAS.......I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH IT .......IT GIVES U IDEAS FOR IT RELATIONSHIP IF U DARE TRY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT R N THE BOOK. I KNOW I WOULD!!!!!!!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Ironic that my main concern about this book is will it  last? since the point of the book is that books can be immortality, they contain the seeds of inspiration for future generations. But this book?  I think it will be dated and quaint in less than ten years.  It relies too much on descriptions of technology, cool now in 2013. But in 2023? Less likely to be so. It is more interesting as a character study of silicon types, and our stereotypes of them. (Funny that Applers payed an almost nonexistent role).<br />What did I like?<br />The bookstore and the central role played by libraries and storage facilities<br />The idea of mr penumbra the kindly avuncular character we always hope we will meet who recognizes the so-far unfounded talent within ourselves<br />The inside look at google????<br />Vonnegut diagrams!!!!<br /><br />What I did not like<br />What was the journey? No redemption as there was no fall, except the disappearance of mr p, ie no one fell into a hole<br />While the character talks about the epic nature of their quest, it never felt like one, you didn't really care.<br />I kept reading because the book did adhere to the central rule of story telling, pose a question and then don't answer it, until the end.<br /><br />So a cute book, with oh so much potential, but in the end too light and insubstantial to hold
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I have never read something like this. It's new and strong. I liked the book because the main character is in such a difficult situation and handles it well.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have not read another zombie novel, and probably will not read one, but I'm glad that my book club partner chose this one. The oral history format, with many different voices and points of view from around the world, is handled well.<br />The author has written extensively about zombies, and this gives credibility to the incredible subject.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a good fantasy book.  I've never read any book like this. Will read book two and probably book three.
B00A32GZOK|5.0|The report that people must want is for the 2013 blu-ray disc quality. It is excellent. It's so magical that you have no chance to resist it. A non-opera nut passing by would stop. I have a fine video & sound system and the vision and sound caused zero disappointment. What, 34 years old? Technically, it looks new. It is so classically fine that it is hard to imagine such a project could happen now. The sound is excellent the Paris Opera orchestra is perfect. There are large numbers of people on screen at times... all looking real. The boat operators, glass blowers and intimate details of life had to be real. For example, I don't think that I have ever seen such elegant food storage in a kitchen on screen. I once worked in a restaurant that inspected each piece of fruit and stored it individually. They were famous for perfection. The humanity includes amazing beauty, a lot of it. The costumes are over the top perfect. You will be drawn into the sets. The sound of birds is a major component, as is the sound of water and rain. All of the singing is wonderful. There is elegance on the screen from first second to last. I have several versions of Giovanni, this moves up to favorite. English subtitles are very good, but I think I may go seat of my pants... without next time. I have several Olive films blu-ray discs, and I have been happy with them all. This movie is the one to use to infect others with the opera bug, but hard core old timers will love it as well. (On the star system... 5 stars. All my reviews are 5 star or 1 star. Don't write unless I love it or hate it.)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this easy-read. You just need to read it for what it is: a book meant to be read easily and meant to entertain people 12years old and up. If you want something more complex... Look in adult fiction materials because this pne is definitely a YA material :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As good as &#34;Mad Men&#34; but even more consistent in quality. Once you watch the first episode of Season 1, you're hooked.  Beware! Season 2 is even better.
1465001107|5.0|All the pictures are clear and beautiful. I will order one next year and every year after that! Just great!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game for your tablet. No need to buy the &#34;premium&#34; version when the free version is just as fun.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|In simple words: it serves my need perfectly fine - very informative and detailed. I would definitely recommend this book to you, if you were considering how to create a professional and marketable ebook.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The best series ever created for television. Its got it all and alwayz keeps you thinking. I hope they make a season 6. I will sure buy it no doubt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is very engaging and ru if you like horses.  you care for, train and compete in shows to earn xp, coins and energy.  I like being able to customize tack and your show outfits.  its really a great game!
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|I have probably watched 'Baraka' no less than seven times.  With the announcement of another Ron Fricke film I waited in anticipation for many months until I could purchase 'Samsara'.  Great cinematography, some good time lapse photography, but where's the message?  Baraka had a great message of a beautiful world and many religions having some common threads. It appears that 'Samsara' was the antithesis of 'Baraka'.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun! I love playing with my horse noisy boy! The horses look so real! Play this game! Its cool!
B008Y7CZUY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I had read the book and the movie was just as good.  It was very interesting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book brings hope to all of us who have list loved ones and who wonder why on earth we are here. And for all of us who suffer guilt for life choices that our religion warns us against.. To know that we are loved no matter what we have done is so life encouraging
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My friend suggested that I read this book.  It was outstanding and a great book from beginning to end.  I was in suspense.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I like Alicia Keys she is a great singer and I would recommend this album to any one who likes music
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever. its so addicting and its really fun!! I play it all the time!! it is awesome how you get mystery boxes and collect coins to get prizes!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a very practical alternative to the larger Nikon Speedlight Flash units, though not ideal for all situations. But, for what it offers it is a great compact hot-shoe flash. For performance this SB-400 is hard to beat. It offers a very fast recharge cycle time so you don't miss as many shots as you would with your built-in flash. The added height sitting on top of your camera body avoids the dreaded shadow that appears with the built-in flash when a longer lens is mounted and in use. It does offer a vertical (up and down) swivel so that the flash can bounce off the ceiling when needed, but not a horizontal (left to right). This is the reason it may not be suitable for all uses. However, when shooting in portrait mode, if there is something (like a wall) to bounce the flash you will still get great results. It might just take a little practice getting used to doing this.  Shots with the flash pointing straight-on should only be done from a good distance as it does put out a strong flash for its size. (Nikon claims 66 feet, though I have not tested this to the extreme.) The lock mechanism is a lever that moves left and right, making the attaching and detaching that much easier and quicker. The SB-400 runs on two (2) AA batteries and gets particularly long-life from Energizer Advanced Lithium. Unfortunately I have never calculated the hours but suffice it to say that I have been impressed with how long I go between changing them. Included with a new unit is a soft zippered pouch to protect it when you travel or store it. If you need a light-weight, small profile, high-power unit, this is the one. As a note, I have used this on both my D90 and D5100. Definitely recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star remake is quick, entertaining, and addictive with lots of razzmatazz … excellent updates! Pure eye candy and amusing.
1400052181|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone, even got my book club to read it. This is such an important part of our medical/scientific history. Skloot does an excellent job of threading her story with Henrietta's. She fills the books with information in a way that makes it interesting. With the new common core standards requiring more non-fiction reading, this is perfect for the high school curriculum. Everyone should read this book!
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I wouldn't recommend this book. I was very frustrated by Lavinia's naivete and weakness.  I never got pulled into the storyline
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Rarely do I think that an adaptation is better than the original. In fact, I resisted going to see Wicked for the longest time. Am I ever glad I saw it. I would pay $30 for DVD recording of the live show (Wish they would do that while we wait for the movie). So the best I can do in the mean time was to get the soundtrack and listen to it. Even better because it has the original Broadway cast. Doubt they every made a video of that.
B00B1C39AY|5.0|This is quite new ground for the Mode, still it has already become a DM classic!<br />They have given a nice european twist to some of the most interesting american sounds.
0545265355|2.0|The good thing about these books is that I actually made it all the way through all three of them (unlike only getting through one and a half of that vampire/bella book series). This is a good dystopic story. My problems with it are first that it did not need to be told in three separate books. Book Two is a repeat of book one (with some action in it finally that I kept waiting for the entire first book). And second, book three shows beyond a doubt the problems that I already felt in the first parts that Collins chose to tell this story from the wrong character's point of view. The protagonists need to be active in their own destinies, a part of the story, catalysts, etc. A huge part of book three happens without Katniss and thus we as readers don't see it either. This is a case where the movies have the potential to be better than the books because they do not need to stay tied to one POV and can create those missing scenes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is.awesome<br />I like playing this on my tablet<br />  so many people is playing this and downloading it.  yeahh
0316228532|5.0|Somehow, I had it in my head that Rowling was writing a murder mystery and this was it. It starts off (I knew before I even bought it) with a death. But A Casual Vacancy makes me think in a way of Tennessee Williams. He described Cat on A Hot Tin Roof as a day in the life. We peer in on a family and see how they have created their own ruts. Well, Rowling's book is like that only expanded to an entire community and a longer period of time. Her introduction of characters is brilliant (learning first from one point of view and then another). The title has its own depth as well. There is a part toward the end that was cliche and made me groan when I saw it coming, but overall it was a good read and good addition to my bookshelf. (For all you Harry Potter fans, this is an adult book--great for those who grew up with Harry and are now adults but not for those who are still kids).
0060987464|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. For those who are Marilyn Manson fans I would say this is a must read. I would read this more than once!
0545128285|5.0|Maybe I just like fairy tales. Maybe I just like Harry Potter's world. Whatever the case, I loves these stories--they are like the Brothers Grimm stories--the kind wizards would tell their children. I only wish there were more. It would be great if Rowling (er Beedle the Bard) would publish some more of these!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|i have nothing bad to say about the big a i been doing bussiness with the big a for a while
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book had a good plot line and was an enjoyable diversion. It had elements of both a good love story as well as some mystery and intrigue.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As I am a Susan fan and liked the songs, how could I not love it.  I am always excited to get her next CD.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Denzel did a good job acting but this was the worst film I watched in years because all he did was drink and snort thru the whole movie.  If Alcoholics Anonymous or Drug Users Anonymous ever wanted a good promotional film this was it.
1451695187|1.0|What disappointing book!<br /><br />Same old stuff - only this time a &#34;Brain Surgeon&#34; is telling the story - so you are<br />suppose to believe it.  It's mostly about his tough life, lack of love as an orphan,<br />finding love in his coma and stating that his coma was heaven...<br /><br />It was so boring that I would have put it down 25 pages into it, but I promised a<br />friend that I'd read it...<br /><br />Here it is - because this camatose guy experienced enlightenment while he was<br />in a coma for a week, he says he actually went to &#34;heaven&#34; while he was in coma.<br /><br />That is such a debatable statement, why spend time writing a boring, flowery book<br />about it?  Because &#34;he&#34; says it - it is now factual?<br /><br />The topic is a little too personal to be relying on the next &#34;Johnny come lately&#34;, who<br />wants guru status!<br /><br />Want to read this book?<br /><br />Wait til you can buy it cheap - like for 50¢.<br /><br />My 2¢
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I read and loved this whole series. I think it's even better than his first, Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
B005M61PGA|5.0|As I have said before, Katie Melua is a wonderful singer and anyone who truly enjoys good music will enjoy hearing her sing!

B00ATP24SW|5.0|I was able to listen to the different tracks on YouTube before I actually received the album and I was very impressed.  Now that I have the CD, it is sitting nicely next to all of my other Strato albums.<br /><br />Personally, this is a great album and one that sounds like it is supposed to fit right after Elysium.  The production is slick and very commercial, but still heavy and there are many remnants of the older Strato formula, even though Timo Tolkki is not on the album.  The guitars sound a little more raw though and that really fits with the music they have written.  The bass guitar still has sounds similar to what the old bass player used to do.  The keyboards are very upfront and as a keyboardist, I like that because there is a dimension that keys bring that actually HELP this sound more metal than simply adding another guitar track.  The drums are very good too and sound much like the drums on Dream Theater's 'Images and Words' album, so they are very powerful.  The vocals are classic Timo Kotipelto and I think that he has established himself in the past as the \\"voice\\" that metal should have and he keeps it going here.<br />I have read other reviews on other sites where they are slamming this album, saying that it is too commercial.  As far as I am concerned, everything that Strato has done has a bit of commercialism to it and that is okay.  It makes it easier to listen to and if it gets them radio play, then great.  This music should be heard.  This is a slick package and really has me impressed by their musicianship.  My only question is, and it may be totally non-founded because I have never seen them live, how are they gonna pull this production off live?  There are so many things going on (the layers of keys and guitars, the vocal choirs, etc...).  This is good stuff.....I am blown away.<br /><br />Now for each song:<br /><br />1. Abandon - I really did not like this one too much, but it rocks.  It sounds too me like a formulaic type song.  Excellent musicianship though.  I have been playing keyboards for over 35 years and have released many of my own albums and such and I am blown by their ability to play these types of songs.<br /><br />2. Unbreakable - I like this song A LOT.  I love the keyboard intro and how the guitar comes in and how it is so heavy.  It is catchy and singable but yet you can bang your head to it.  The lyrics are positive and I like that in a heavy song.<br /><br />3. Stand My Ground - The first part of this song reminds me somewhat of 030366 from Fourth Dimension.  It is a little weird to hear the processing being so much because they've not have it before but it works.  I sense a little difficulty in the transition between the verses to the chorus though, because the processing is not in one the vocals in the chorus.<br /><br />4. Halcyon Days - I am still trying to wrap my mind around this one.  This one could easily be in a game or something.  Great keyboard programming and great drumming on this one.<br /><br />5. Fantasy - I like this one too.  I would think that this is one of the songs that would get radio play.  It has all the right things to make it a radio song.  The lyrics are positive too and that is cool.<br /><br />6. Out of the Fog - I think that this is one of my favorites on the entire album.  I love the metal cadence in the beginning.  Their syncopation is top notch and this song would get fist pumps all day long.<br /><br />7. Castles in the Air - This one does not do too much for me.  It is written well though and the classical intro/outtro is cool.<br /><br />8. Dragons - This is another one that would garner radio play.  Listen to the background guitar work on this one.  The rhythm style is awesone and works so well.<br /><br />9. One Must Fall - This song does not rate that high on my like meter.  It is a good song, but does not speak to me.  It kind of reminds me a little bit of Don't Tread on Me from Metallica and something that Dream Theater would write.  The thing that surprised me was the soft transition at abuut 3:11.  They stop their thrash type thing and went into a slow synthy thing with a great solo by Jens.  I have great respect for his ability to play and write.<br /><br />10. If the Story is Over - I like this one too, especially the beginning.  It is tenderly played and sung, not to mention the great whistling part in the song.  The only thing that catches me wrong is the transition from the soft to the hard part.  It sounds wrong to me and does not quite fit for me, but both parts are good.  I think that the transition could have been smoother.<br /><br />11. Nemesis - This is another that just rocks.  Try to follow the time signature in the beginning, it will be hard to do.  They do so many cool things in this song.  I would think that this is another one that would be used as a radio song.  This seems like a song with many different examples of what Strato can do all wrapped up into one song.  Very cool sampling.<br /><br />So - for those who do not know of Strato and want to listen for the first time, I think that they are going to be blown away.  The musicianship is flawless and the production is very slick.  This is a good album to get to know the new Strato with.  One may think that the previous albums (Polaris and Elysium) that feature the new bassist and guitarist may not be as grand as this album.  they may be right in some respects, but it is neat to hear how things have progressed since their addition to the band.<br />If you really want to get to know Strato, you have to listen to all of their stuff (which is a given).  Their style changed dramatically early on in their career and they really reached a pinnacle with albums like Visions and Destiny (my fav from that era is Infinite).  Listening to the new stuff to the old stuff, there seems to me a little bit more air between the instruments in the older Strato.  The music was also a little bit more guitar driven in the older Strato.  The new Strato takes what Strato was and filled in the 'air' from before but it does not sound cluttered or too busy.  What I really like is how cohesive everything is as a unit.  What is also nice is how they have been able to take it up a notch and add so much more and yet still have a Strato type sound.<br /><br />You guys have my respect and support.  You are great musicians and put out another great product for us to listen to.ng that surprised me was the soft transition at abuut 3:11.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved the movie and by pre ordering I save a lot of money. I would recomend the movie to my friends.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|I gave HT three stars because the kids liked it. To me it was Tangled/Finding Nemo all mixed up. With that said it feels like I have seen it before. The dialogue is so full of fast paced puns and jokes that the actual story takes forever to develop. The colors and setting are great, but the \\"acting\\" and story were lacking for me to like. If you want to buy this move I would wait until it goes down in price.
0307352145|5.0|This book is one which helps introverts realize they are special - not wierd.  The world IS full of TALKING, but not necessarily talking with meaning.  Great read.
B0095P31L6|1.0|This movie is not for kids. There was language not suitable for kids.  I enjoyed only small parts of it.  enough said.
B000002O4X|5.0|Both the movie and the musical score are excellent.  I keep this sound track in my car all the time and turn to it when I need something quiet to ease by soul or rest my mind.<br /><br />Redford and Meryl Streep are great together.  Meryl Streep is at her finest in this movie.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all.  The plot wasn't amazing and the fight scenes were few and pretty standard.  The resurrection part wasn't as big of a deal as it could have been either.<br /><br />Hardly entertaining, period.
0062206281|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a great writer.  As soon as he comes out with a new novel, I immediately purchase it and plan to keep all of his books.  Normally, I only buy non fiction and get my fiction from the library.  With Zafon, I want to own his books so I can reread them at any time.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|The movie was just wonderful.i enjoyed it.bob marley was a hero.he truly made a difference.i loved it.worth seeing.i recommend it.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Trying to get used to my new Kindle is so much more fun with the Mahjong on it.  I have been playing this game on our computer at home and it helps me get comfortable with my Kindle so much faster.  I like the fact that the games move to more and more difficulty as I progress.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series,  Photography and actors and story great.  Hope the 3rd series is out for Prime soon so I can watch it
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child ALWAYS writes excellent novels.  Jack Reacher is alive and well in this latest one and promises to keep us flipping pages as fast as we can.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie. Funny and easy to watch. Would watch again! Definitely a  good movie to watch with friends!
0307592731|5.0|This book is perfect for anyone considering hiking long distances.  It not only shows that a complete novice can make that type of commitment and accomplish her goals, but it gives a wonderful description of the beauty and wonder that awaits a hiker.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Flight was a fantastic movie! The graphics were phenomenal. It's worth purchasing and watching from home. I would watch this movie again.
B007MDB71O|5.0|One of the very few Blue Ray films I thought worth owning.  I saw it 3 times in the theater, and had to have it.<br />We may never get a sequel, but this is a terrifically entertaining epic.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|why should we pay when I can get a bunch of art apps for free I mean serisoly. Ps I can do this at my friends house tor free.

1616550414|5.0|I love seeing zelda art and process art together, great inspiration for any illustrator or video artist/ concept artist out there.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|A typical teen movie full of over indulged teens. I would not buy if given the chance to have a do over
B00BAYLRNO|3.0|\\"You've got to go and do something. Go help people, you're good at it.\\" This is a true story of a family that went on vacation to Thailand during the Christmas of 2004. The same time the massive tsunami struck. The family is separated and lost in a strange country wishing and hoping they will find each other again. First off I will say that this is very emotional so be prepared for that. Also I know Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for this but the kid that played Lucas should have been the one who was nominated. As far as the movie goes it was good, and I know it is a true story but it was really just too unbelievable for me to really get into. When the super emotional parts happened I was thinking, yeah right rather then tearing up. That is just me and maybe I am heartless but I couldn't get past the totally \\"impossible\\" aspects of the movie. All that said though this is a good movie and if you can handle it I would say watch it. Overall, a good true story that was just a little to unbelievable for me to get fully invested in. I give it a B.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love subway surfers! It always keeps me busy and is so much fun! I really think it is better than temple run! It is truly amazing.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|it is the best game ever I play it every day I love it it is the best game ever
B00006F2WY|5.0|Having been a fan of the Deep Purple Mark One lineup, I bought this LP in 1970 and really liked it.  Mr. Jon Lord was a true virtuoso musician, well-versed in playing classical and jazz as well as rock.  His composition for orchestra and group is great music.  The contrasting components do work well together.  Ritchie Blackmore's aggressive and wild guitar (when he was still playing a Gibson 335) adds dynamite soloing.  Highly reccomended for Deep Purple fans and anyone who likes intelligent and progressive music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Some game I love to pay it when I just got it.<br /> Not the same as temple run but just as fun. Coins are hard to get but that's ok<br />When you get a prize. Box. I RECOMMEND THIS APP
B004J64QSI|5.0|I love the show, the music, the acting.  Seeing the 25th Anniversary special was a real treat. I recommend both the CD and the DVD.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't know y everyone says this does not work on Fire. It works AWESOME! I can see all of my folders and it tells me when I have a new email, very nice, u can make a signature and I say it rocks.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Found the disc to be in great shape along with the packaging.<br />This is a great collection. The only one I didn't like was the Temple of Doom that girl just yells to much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play this game because I can do it on my own. This game is easy and does not require answes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|that game is so fun children can compete for a place to win a game and you can take care of a horse
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this final book in the series. The author wrote the book well. I really enjoyed how the author went back to the character as a child so you could get to see how the characters past shaped his future.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|There needs to be more emphasis on the zombies and less on the humans.  What happened to the days where the zombies were the human's worst fears?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. It has a great storyline and holds your interest. Couldn't wait to read the next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always loved horses, anything to do with them...So this game is so much fun... I a 63 years old.....Love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is alot of fun. You have to pay attention so you don't touch on the wrong thing. It makes you concentrate on what you are doing.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Fast moving story that was difficult to put down. Interesting insights into the characters and their backgrounds ,as well as, an almost unbelievable event. My husband is reading it now. I would like to inquire of any books about those pilots that flew the &#34;Hump&#34; during WWII. Had a brother that was such a pilot and would very much like to learn more about their experiences.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone even if you love to read or if you don't.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Go out and get this one if you are a Frank Sinatra fan.  Count Basie & Frank Sinatra what more do you need to say.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The period of this series is of a bygone era. I'm a genealogy buff, and so I find Downton Abbey fascinating. From the attention to details of that era to the wonderful character portrayals and lavish settings it is a joy to the senses from the opening scene to the end of each episode. The downside? The seasons will someday end. Season 3 just finished here in the US, and a fourth will come next year. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the seasons will go on for a long time! One final note....if you live Maggie Smith? She does not disappoint!!! The dowager duchess is a hoot!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this show and it just keeps getting better each week.  Recommend everyone watch this show from the beginning. Sorry I waitred so long
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first one! This has graphics that are superior and different. You have better gems and collections. I think you'll have a great time (even with the free one) with this game app.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Cute movie to watch with the family. This is a movie you can watch over and over and still enjoy.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We all expect a new bond film to be the thrill of the century well this one  IS.<br />Fast furious  very tense and interesting<br />The plot is unique encapsulated in guns , fire fast chase, cyber  phenomena's and absolutely amazing sceneries  as bond film should be.<br />We have past and present high tech and gadget instrumentations all in all a fist to the eye.<br />Acting is good from all actors a bit over shadowed by Javier Bardem , his acting is out of this world brilliant<br />I would say this is the best 007 since \\"from Russia with love\\".
B0052MN4TA|5.0|If you do not have this album, then stop reading these reviews right now and buy \\"What's Going On,\\" listen to it, and come back to finish reading.<br /><br />I can't say anything about this record that hasn't already been said a thousand times. I would just like to reiterate the idea that listening to the singles from this album is not the same as listening to the album from beginning to end. Even the title track, long considered one of the greatest songs of all time, is only a pale version of itself out of the context of the songs that follow. Each theme in the song \\"What's Going On\\" is expanded upon and given a full treatment later. The listener simply can't understand the whole message of the track without understanding the complete artist's vision as explained in the rest of the album. I'm speaking from personal experience here.<br /><br />Simply put, no one \\"gets\\" Marvin Gaye (or even, perhaps, American popular music in general) without having come to terms with the fullness of this record. I know I didn't.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a very nice feel good movie. This buy was a replacement as we lost our original copy.<br />I highly recommend this film for it's warm situations and humor. Gotta love Hugh Grant as the<br />dancing PM.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  Not sure I would recommend it for anyone under 15 as there is quite a bit of language and sexual references.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I felt they tried to be too artsie.There was just too much going on..It was great visually though. But that wasnt enough to make it good.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I am a huge fan of all Ice Age movies and this one didn't disappoint.  Usually I tend to shy away from sequels but not with Ice Age.  They are always great at keeping the laughs coming.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I was playing one day and I got off of it and when I got back on it had clear everything and I was really mad I had to start all over but other then that I love the game it really fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ever since I purchased this game for the kids I rarely get to play on my own kindle.  They love this game and it is pretty neat.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden objects games. This one isn't too hard but provides just enough of a challenge. Am having a great time exploring this game and its rooms.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I have always loved Finding Nemo.  Full of comedy and action but very clean and touching. Highly recommend this movie.
B00BESM14U|1.0|This movie was outrageously predictable, with the same terrible plot of awkward boy finds outcast group finds love finds popularity. Had to turn it off out of boredom.
B009MO5960|5.0|This movie is so visually stunning and just cool in every way. I was really blown away in some parts, especially the opening. I saw this when it came out in theatre and knew I just had to own it when it came out.<br />Some of the violence was a bit over-the-top and too much though, but I guess it fits well into the scenario.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|The subject line pretty much covers it.  Been 2 (or 3?) episodes with no Cass or Crowley which is disappointing.  Both actors and characters are great. A little stretching on a couple of plots but overall a vast improvement over season 7.  Hope the boys aren't getting tired of their jobs.  ;-)  Here's to looking forward to season 15.  Best show on TV.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I love this product! It has made keeping up with all the blogs I follow so easy! I have on my andriod and Kindle.  Really love it on my Kindle.  Highly Recommend this product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! I recommend this for all ages! Its an awesome game! I just love trying to get all the mini games in it and it costs no money!
B007BT0RKG|3.0|This app is great for following your location  on its maps. The reason I only gave it three stars was because it only shows about 5% of the restaurants and gas stations in our area. I would guess it would be better in larger citys
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|&#34;That 70's Show&#34;, &#34;Family Guy&#34; and &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; had a love child.  A unfunny, horny, pot smoking teddy bear.  This movie does not even qualify as B flick.  I would not say I hate it,  I would rather have my 3.99 back, though.  Seth Mcfarlane is usually a lot more interesting than &#34;Flash Gordan&#34; on cocaine punching wholes through walls.  Unfortunately I do not think after this he will get another chance at a movie.  Wow this is a long way from Spawn...
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Treasure Island is a fantastic classic.  A tale about the sea and pirates from a time long gone.  Highly recommended for slightly older kids.  Some language.
B007THA4FI|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is so much more than a big book about a small town. It beautifully and tragically depicts how we are all connected in our lives... The nobility of the disadvantaged and the recklessness of the fortunate come together in this intense, richly detailed novel. Ms. Rowling has written yet another gem.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm keeping this short and sweet...new people to watching this show, start from Season 1 or you won't understand the awesomeness!  Also, I think Season 2 was better than Season 3...I still cannot pinpoint why.  Either way, every episode is high quality and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this shame does have some loading issues on my kindle but I love this game along with my little brother. its easy and fun for everyone!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Such a wonderful book.<br />I would recommend this book to everybody!<br />Definitely had me by the edge.<br />Could not put this down!!
B003TNM2ME|5.0|I really like this movie, it shows how people might react to something they cannot understand, and how insane they can get. The ending is epic.
B005CRQ2XA|3.0|It had some great ideas, but some bad words for my family like: butt<br />Oh my God:( but good ideas
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Please make more characters to play with we love this game so much we make a family night out of it !!!! Love it

B005FITIDC|3.0|It was  an interesting movie but I did not like the movie because it was a bit too real and too bloody.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I can not down load this app either. What's goin on? I'm new to this and I'm really gettin mad cause I can't understand how to do alot. This is getting old fast everything is complicated or don't work!!#!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great Batman Trilogy.  This was a gift and the recipient could not have been happier to receive it.  It also arrived right on time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. The world tour is awesome. And the best part is... it's free!!! Everyone will love this game.
B002IW8V0E|5.0|I love ABBA and was rather skeptical when this movie came out. So I gave it a try and have to say I like Meryl Streeps and Pierce Brosnans performances. Funny, cute musical.<br />The package deal is great as a gift for the already hooked. The booklet has some insight on the process and the CD has the essentials when it comes to the soundtrack.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Touched my heart, stimulated my mind and facilitated a deeper understanding of the effects of war... I am off to order the second book now.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We got one of these when my daughter was only a few months old. She is almost 2 now and has to have the Wubbanub when she goes to sleep. It's like her best friend. Although she doesn't use the pacifier feature anymore, it's still a toy that provides her comfort. We named him George after Curious George. Great buy!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am so glad that I found this app.  It has made my day.  See I sit hooked up to a machine for around four hours every other day, just to say I get board.  This makes my time there go by faster. Thank you...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I beat the game on my first try on easy mode on the farm map.  Slenderman moves which he doesn't on computer. now I can play slender anytime!!!!! epic.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Definitely a book worth reading! Perfectly captures the emotions of being young, in high school, and just trying to fit in. Beautifully written.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I'm totally a Doctor Who junkie now and am looking forward to the next seasons.  It does feel like the show is more about the Pond's now than the Doctor, but I still enjoy the Doctor enough to battle through that.
0739384198|5.0|Very riveting- wanted to hear the entire story at once.Took a while to  identifying the many characters with unusual names. Can not wait for the next book<br />Ute Loeffler
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you have ever worked in and aspect of IT, DevOps, or Infosec you will definitely be able to relate to this book. I recommend it to everyone.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Got this app free shortly after getting my Kindle HD for Christmas. It works fine, loads instantly and shows everything I need to know at a glance.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I fell in love with every song. The lyrics are very catchy but at the same time very powerful. My new favorite.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am totally addicted to this series.  After watching Season One, I had to order copies of all 3 seasons in order to have my own copy.  Now I am loaning it out to others who had never seen this series, but had heard about it.  I have watched it over and over and over.
0345803507|1.0|I bought them for my wife, who to my surprise, read all three of them.<br />The contents obviously appeal mainly to women.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved this book. There were a few typos in the book though but still a good book. Looking forward to the next Mitch Rapp book.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a great game but it is a little slow on my kindle fire.  playing this game on the Ilario is faster
B0070Y46UY|5.0|At first Intriguing and then riveting tale of self exploration and survival by a wordsmith who's storytelling would keep me hungry for more....
B00AECGQF2|1.0|this app is stupid and the day after i bought it for 2.99  it went on sale for 1.99 and I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Through-put speed is slow for video. Audio is faster than video. Netflix does not have this problem. I hope amazon can address this issue. I am going to stay with the service any way because it does not detract from getting the full effect of watching the show.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is probably the most riveting show I have seen in a long time.  I cannot wait for season two to become available on Amazon!
0679422714|5.0|Jung Chang goes behind the facade and gives us the inside thinking motivations intentions of Mao. Because her grandmother was a concubine of a northern warlord, and both of her parents cadres in Mao's force, and she was in the Cultural Revolution, Jung Chang is able to speak from the emotional and mental sides of consciousness, a necessary balance of understanding the full flow of life.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A great read and a good set up for the final book in the trilogy. Waiting to read the series before seeing the movie. It will be interesting to see how it's translated to the big screen.

0783225733|5.0|this movie is one of the best made, not just of a certain year. Ron Howard has a genius at work in the direction of this movie. It was based on true events. The cast was well chosen with Tom Hanks in the lead. The parts suited the actors well especially &#34;ken Mattingly&#34;.  There was just the  right amount of tech jargin to keep the scientifically minded entertained without it being dull. The tension built up to a high level even knowing the outcome. I always hunt for the Howard family as Ron uses them in every film. Rance, his father, was their priest, his mother was Tom Hanks' mother, and brother Clint was one of the scientists who was on the  team converting oxygen filters. I love this movie!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It is a fun game but........ I lost all my ponnys one day and now its abit boring. I think you should play but not buy stuf with monny.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Well written, descriptive, couldn't put it down. A good start to what is a fantastic series. Have already brought the next one.
B0026KX5PO|1.0|I am a great Matt Damon fan, but not when he is playing the bad guy.  The scenery was beautiful in this film, but I did not care for the story.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I love it and have already pre-ordered season 2. This is among the best TV out there. I recommend it.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I heard this band on internet radio and decided to check out album.  This album really shows how good they are.  Lead singer has a great voice, WOW.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am glad I got this app, it works flawlessly on my 2nd gen Kindle Fire. Thanks Amazon for making it the Free App of the day. Thanks developers for a good game, and for not snooping around on my device!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Of course the children love it.  We like the extra copies for the multiple uses; i.e., Blu-ray at home, DVD in car, and Dig Copy for road trips.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|A fun, well produced (even for low-budget) action kung-fu movie that has some of the most brutal and realistic fight scenes on film.  While there are some sticky moments with the tactics, and the lack of communications that make this a little un-realistic, the fight scenes most definitely make up for it.  Would have liked a little more character development but with all the ass-kicking going on there wasn't much time.  The pounding sound track from Mike Shinoda is an excellent extra as well.  Overall this belongs in any action buff/Kung-fu movie lovers collection.  Oh and the dubbing is average but once again, here for the butt-whip!
B004G600A4|5.0|Walt's legacy lives on ...  As an adult who gets to watch or read a lot of Disney stories, I have to appreciate some of the adult-like humor in these films.  I'm 99% sure they're meant to keep us laying down the cash.  Certainly beats some of the spastic cartoons of the modern era.  Daughter loves this story.  We have since started purchasing the Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy combos, so we can take them wherever.
1401937519|5.0|I loved the book. I found Dying To Be Me both inspiring and thought provoking reading.  I highly recommend it.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I just started playing and I don't quite understand how it works. I obviously understand the game of Bingo, but how all of a sudden, the game is over and the names on the right of the screen keep jumping up and down.<br />I could do with out the texting on the side and would like to have that option of removing it from my screen.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this game is so fun! I love it! you get timed to see how fast you are...so I keep challenging myself to get quicker! very addictive....I told my mom about it, now she cant stop playing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  It's much more about the human struggle than the zombie apocalypse, and that's what makes it so interesting.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a selection for our book club and came highly recommended.  I found it to have great character development and engaging plot.  Historical contextualization was quite weak.  Overall it was well-written and hard to put down.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Trust me when I say you will not be dissapointed  with Sinister. This even made my husband jump back a few good times, and he is hard to scare. This movie delivers it all in what a blockbuster horror movie should be and I wish it had been noticed more. The ending is right up there with the DEVESTATING ending that Stephen King gives in THE MIST. Perfect!!! This will be a part of my vast horror collection.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|As the headline of this review states, I LOVE this.  It has very rarely left my car's CD player since I purchased it over a month ago.  Every single song on this soundtrack is fantastic.  The packaging is cool, plus is comes with a nice little poster.  I went to see Django (the movie) three times, so I might be a little biased.  But if you enjoyed the film, you'll enjoy this soundtrack.  It also has snippets of dialogue from the movie, even bonus pieces that weren't in the movie.  Tarantino is brilliant :)
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I am not a huge Denzel fan, but I always give his movies a try. He is such a diverse actor that you slmost oew it to yourself to him. This movie showed the not so sexy side of him and think I prefer him in these types of roles. I think movie was underrated and missed. Very good plot and actors.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|this game takes me back to playing outrun in the arcade room.but now i can save all my quarters and tokens. this plays a lot better than the first final freeway.and now with moga support this game is the truth
B007L5GDGW|3.0|This game really made me feel my age. You see, I am not as good at video games as the younger generation. I tried to play this game for quite some time after I downloaded it. Consistently I was able to keep my marble on the path for just a few seconds before it fell off.<br /><br />What I would like to see in this game is an option for a slower mode and/or an option for bumpers like those used to help newbies learn how to bowl.  You know, the ones that prevent gutter balls. Options like these would be a kindness for folks like me.<br /><br />This game reminds me of some of the racing courses in Mario Kart.  I fall off those too. My ten year old daughter laughs good naturedly when I do this and we tend to play the easier courses.  My wife noticed that when attempting to steer the marble in mid-air, the responsiveness of the controls is slow. When my daughter began playing, she had much better success at this game than my wife and I.  But, she told me to write that she doesn't really care for this game.<br /><br />When you fall off the course into the universe, it takes way too long to get back into the game.  Waiting for the prolonged falling sequence to end is annoying. It would be good if you could tap anywhere on the screen to bypass this sequence when it begins.<br /><br />If you're not adept at using tilting controls, then this game might not be for you. I noticed there is a free version of this game. I could not readily discern the difference between the paid and free versions. You might want to try the free before investing in the paid.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Flight is a movie very much worth seeing.  Denzel Washington's acting is superb, teamed with hilarious comic relief is given by John Goodman during his brief appearances in the film.  Excellent storyline and intense moments.  The only issue I have is how the movie ended.  It left me wanting a bit more.  But, I highly recommend this film!

B004H83IM8|5.0|What a good idea, putting all three Austin Powers comedies on two discs! Rumors have been floating about of Mike Myers returning for a fourth installment; however, that rumor has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, just sit back & enjoy these outrageous comedies. The first, \\"International Man of Mystery\\", benefits from being just that---because it's the first, it's the freshest & funniest spoof of British spy flicks. Myers really spread his parody wings on this one, undoubtedly one of the funniest films of the 90's, which is based upon a 60's fish-out-of-water character. He shows versatility in characters (can Powers and Dr. Evil be any more different?), as well as branding great catchphrases into the minds of moviegoers.<br />Myers and director Jay Roach reunite for \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\", which really pushes the envelope on bathroom humor & racy jokes (especially the former with the introduction of disgusting blob-like Scottish henchman Fat Bastard) as Powers time-travels back to 1969 in pursuit of Evil as he hatches his latest bid for world domination (and gains a \\"son\\" in tiny, ill-tempered clone Mini-Me). This one has its share of groaners; but there's enough new elements to offset the bad jokes (particularly when Myers repeats old gags).<br />\\"Goldmember\\" might be the weakest in the series; again, some jokes as the \\"a MILLION DOLLARS\\" bit have just been done too many times in which they cease to be funny. But the clever premise--a movie within a movie, with famous actors such as Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, John Travolta, etc., taking on various roles from the series--is really something to see, with a knowing wink or inside joke on the movie industry. But again, there's enough new stuff to recover from bad puns. The great Michael Caine has some cheeky moments as Powers' famous spy Dad. Myers really goes over the top this time as Dr. Evil becomes sort of a caricature of himself, there's the inclusion of a weird 70's disco-era villain (the title character), along with a climax which digresses into sort of a convoluted \\"family soap opera\\". But nevertheless, it's all good fun.<br />Depending on your sense of humor, you'll either think these films are a grab bag of satire, puns & racy jokes, or you'll think they're simply hilarious. I thought the latter, of course! Groovy baby!(the title character), along with a climax which digresses into sort of a convoluted \\"family soap opera\\". But nevertheless, it's all good fun.<br />Depending on your sense of humor, you'll either think these films are a grab bag of satire, puns & racy jokes, or you'll think they're simply hilarious. I thought the latter, of course! Groovy baby!

B005LAIGYQ|4.0|SAW this video being played on a DVD shop window and I got it because the action (truck chase) looked good and real<br />Difference with this DVD is, I actually watched it quite soon after: some times, it takes me a long time to watch something I got<br />Have watched (too) many NAVY SEALs type shows - this one's good because it's real: SEALs die, something some shows try to avoid<br />Like the narration story-telling approach and I learnt something about Tecumseh<br />At 110 minutes, it's a bit too long for Attention Deficient people like me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that almost every three weeks you should change witch city,state,or country like maybe Rio,England,itly,or Tokyo.And maybe you could make a game based on subway surfer if you do tell me what the title is so I can get thank you.....

B001LF347E|5.0|It has been many years since I've become &#34;addicted&#34; to a television show, but Merlin got me, and got me good. If you are a fan of anything to do with the Arthurian Legend, you will enjoy this show. It does not strictly adhere to the legend, but rather puts its own take on events, characters and places within the context of the legend. What has entertained me the most with this series is the excellent acting from the ensemble cast of relatively unknown actors, in particular Colin Morgan as Merlin himself. The writing can be suspect at times, but the acting more than makes up for those lapses. The settings and special effects do well to keep the fantasy in tact. I have enjoyed this show form beginning to end, and am sorry that it has come to an end. I know I will wear out my DVDs watching whenever I need a Merlin fix!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun but I will admit that sometimes it does lag alittle which does cause me to loose a lot. But besides that the game is really fun for all ages.
B00B2QA646|5.0|A poetic ballet, lavishly painted, as artistically sensuous and romantic as Anna herself. I am writing from the cross-disciplinary perspective of a multi-media artist (painting, choreography, poetry, directing, theatre & film sets, etc.) and a psychologist. This movie is a deeply meaningful, profoundly beautiful gift for my artist/psychologist soul.<br /><br />Whereas some viewers were disconcerted by the (fluid, connected) rapid shifts between the interior of the theatre and &#34;reality&#34; - the reality I know and experience is multifaceted - there are many human realities that are really &#34;played out&#34; in the theatre, amidst the audience, and in the actors in the human drama of life and love. There are times when reading a novel or watching a play or film, when the artistically represented reality completely embraces the audience member or the reader. We are caught up in the story. Memories from our own lives are brought back into the forefront of thought. Even neurologically, our brains respond as though we were either one of the characters or as if we were standing there, watching it happen. But, for this to happen, there must be a coherence, a match, between the work of art and the individual audience member.<br /><br />Having read the novel, I saw how the film presented the essence of many characters, with their varying experiences and types of love, commitment, kindness, forgiveness or blame, authenticity or artificiality, guiltlessness and guilt, represented in complex characters with breadth of emotion, action, and thought.<br /><br />As a dancer, I loved and fell into the graceful camera movement, very specific dancelike gestures and poses, turning, opening, bending, where someone's gaze went. The artistic &#34;art&#34;ificiality of the film gave a surreal quality that somehow conveyed how characters became swept up in events and emotions.<br /><br />As a painter, I loved the attention to texture, shape, pattern, light and shadow.<br /><br />As apsychologist, I loved the variety of characters, major and minor, and how accurately Tolstoy represented the vast difference in the rights and roles of men vs. women - the double standard looms large here.<br /><br />I'm glad I purchased the film instead of renting it, because I will be watching this again and again.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Excellent.  Truly a &#34;laugh out loud while you're reading&#34; type of book.  One of David Sedaris' best, in my opinion.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|The animation if you can call it that is almost life like at times.  Action packed and always moving. I would tell anyone to give it a watch.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Very well done and full of humor on a  sensitive subject.  Helen Hunt is excellent as the sex therapist and of course John Hawkes played his paralized role with skill.<br />The priest was sensitive and very realistic and not at all preachy.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm a huge Downton Abbey fan. Huge. But I was disappointed in the first episode of series III. Maybe there was too much hype about Shirley McClain. (I'm a huge fan of McClain's, too, but not in this film.) My favorite episode was the next to last. Loved the scenes with Lady Mary and Matthew. I would have loved the last episode, too, if Dan Stevens hadn't quit the series. In fact, I was furious with Julian Fellowes (another favorite of mine), until I learned he had no choice in this decison.<br /><br />Still, this is a wonderful world to spend time in, and you can bet that I'll buy Season IV.<br /><br />Jackie King

Both of these characters are damaged and neither is innocent.

B00004U38N|5.0|Giants Of Jazz. The Boogie Woogie.<br /><br />This: The Boogie Woogie, Giants of Jazz CD CD53348 album is pretty much a year 2000 reissue of: The Boogie Woogie performed by the original artists, on the 1990 Giants of Jazz CD53003.  The only differences are that the 1990 album has 4.) Beulah's  Sister's  Blues by Lionel Hampton,  6.) Yancey Special by Meade  Lux  Lewis,  9.) Pinetop's Boogie by Sam Price, and  20.) Tatum-Pole Boogie by Art Tatum, for a total of 64 minutes 17 seconds, while the 2000 album has 18.) Two Finger Boogie by  Lionel Hampton, 20.) Vine Street Boogie by  Jay Mc Shann, 21.) Gene's Boogie by  Carolyn Grey with Gene Krupa, 22.) Dizzy Boogie by Slim Gaillard, for a total of  64 minutes  44 seconds.  The remainder of  the songs are identical on the two albums.  Is it worth getting both albums?  Why not?  They are cheap enough, and it doesn't hurt to have a backup copy of these original hit classics by the original artists. The music on both albums sounds quite good considering the age of the music sources.  A few songs are a little scratchy sounding and were probably recovered from 78's, but overall both albums have acceptable fidelity.  Take your pick, or just pick both and be done with it.  Life is too short to sweat too much over the small decisions.

B000GYI32M|5.0|This is a wonderful show.  I am so happy I can now own it and live through it all over again.  Lots of drama.  Unless you have their kind of money you will feel like it is a total fantasy... and if you do have that kind of money... well you still might think of it as a fantasy.  I mean it is just soooo much drama for one season.  But I like it.

B005LAII94|4.0|I wasn't exactly in the mood to watch a two hour movie about another story revolving around weed dealing and the drug cartel.  I had low expectations when I started watching this, but by the end of the film I was blown away.  The only reason I knocked a star off this is the last ten minutes ruined the ride.  I hate it when filmmakers compromise and do something unrealistic and silly to close up a movie.  The rest of the movie was fantastic.  Blake Lively is the girlfriend or play thing for two men played by Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson.  The two men are peaceful pot dealers of the some of the greatest pot.  Of course there little love triangle might be seen as odd.  Three people in a relationship together just doesn't work and isn't real.  It also plays that way.  The girl feels adored by the showering attention from the men.  And the men are more into each other sharing everything including the girl.  That is until the Mexican cartel wants a piece of their weed business.  The two men turn the deal down and the top dog drug lord is furious and has their sex pot girl abducted.  I'm not giving away the story because this is what sets the story off into a roller coaster ride of adrenaline.  Everyone is surprised to find the top drug lord is a woman played by Salma Hayek.  She is the highlight of this movie.  It's always great to have an incredible actor playing a tough villain and she does with great veracity.  She doesn't do it alone, she's got her own sleazy hitman played also beautifully by Benicio Del Toro.  They are both so good they overshadow the performances by the American leads with the exception of Blake Lively who takes her sex pot act and ramps it up to something more interesting as the movie progresses.  The hype surrounding this movie was the fixation on the three way love affair.  That's minuscule compared to what really goes on in the movie.  I walked in expecting a super bad movie and I walked out thoroughly entertained....that is until the last ten minutes when its wrapped up in a lame way.  You wouldn't expect that from an experienced Director like Oliver Stone, but I'll over look it and keep how the movie should have ended fresh in my mind.  Surprisingly entertaining movie!n minutes when its wrapped up in a lame way.  You wouldn't expect that from an experienced Director like Oliver Stone, but I'll over look it and keep how the movie should have ended fresh in my mind.  Surprisingly entertaining movie!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this, we go sexy bodies with no clothes on, we have a crazy fabulous gay man who will make you laugh, we have vampires and lots of other nightly scary things.  If you have not seen it, be prepared for lots of sex, lots of nudity and a very good show.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I see Schindler's List as one of those movies that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. It might be difficult movie for some to watch, due to how disturbing and sad it is, but it is important that the Holocaust doesn't repeat itself (those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it). It's a movie that everyone at the high school I went to views before they graduate, and I hope that there are many more schools that do the same.<br /><br />The fact that the film is in black and white (for the most part) really draws the mood of the movie; sad and somber. If Spielberg filmed it in color, I do not think the mood would have been captured as well. Schindler's list while sad tells the incredible story of how one man stood up to one of the most evil regimes in world history and did what was right. Saved lives. I won't get into how he made money off it it, because it's not as important as saving the lives of innocent people. Once again I hope this is a film everybody sees at least once in their life. Taking a class about the Holocaust in high school, I became an advocate in hoping people take tie to learn about the Holocaust so such horrific event never occur again and watching Schindler's list is a piece to that puzzle.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|People raved to me about this movie but for me it was just ok.  I mean it was not bad, do not get me wrong.  Good special affexts and good acting, but kinda slow at first. Too much building up the story to get to the main plot.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|I liked the fact that Sparks included a bit of suspense in this novel. He also draws Katie's &#34;back story&#34; out over multiple chapters, which I also liked. Much better than just spitting it out there. I'm not usually a fan of Sparks' writing style, but I did enjoy the book. Much better than the movie (although I did picture Josh Duhamel) as I was reading. ;)
0143117009|5.0|I'm writing this several years after reading this book, and after noting there are already 560 people who have also given their opinions. As we see in every such forum the bias of many people is evident, and this is not a problem. The willingness of many to question can help expose the salient points, and hopefully widen the perspective of all involved.<br /><br />  All that said, It truly helps to have a plausible argument.Diamond has tried to give us a way to examine our past and our future, which the great majority of people can not or will not consider. There are many reasons for this, but they haven't changed throughout the human experience, and there is no reason to think they will change except in evolutionary time. Unfortunately, that means our trajectory as a species will not change until we have reached one limit or another which we can't work around. As it happens, we are reaching many limits at the same time.<br /><br />  Our future will be dramatically different from our recent past, and this is not because of the technological wonderland everyone likes to anticipate. Diamond demonstrates for us the mechanisms of collapse but he obviously can't describe how a global collapse will look. He doesn't need to. We are in it. The speed , the types of upheaval and disintegration, the consequences on all scales and the feedbacks that develop are free for us to imagine, and observe. But lets at least stop pretending we can avoid them.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|I borrowed this title as an audio book from my local library and took it on vacation with me.  I soon discovered that I was repeatedly stopping the MP3 to take notes.  That didn't seem like a vacation activity to me.  So, on about the fourth day of vacation I gave up and ordered the Kindle version of the book, where I could highlight and take notes without switching from one device to another.  I also can pause and ponder (isn't that part of what books are for?).<br /><br />As a writer, I must use both the left- and right-side of my brain, to be both critical and creative.  This book helps me keep my bearing.<br /><br />And, yes, I am left-handed, so I wanted to read about my future.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a well written diagram espousing a positive notion of change through the habitual attention involving the details of our actions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it makes it seem like you accually have a horse. I'm a huge fan of horses so this is the perfect game for me. I hope you love it to.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am an Anne of Green Gables fan and to me this seems like the Anne of Green Gables of Britain. It's roughly the same time period and full of all the beauty, struggles, joys and hilarities of small town and country life. The acting is wonderful and the story line is quite engaging. Season 1 has only one painfully corny/ will time the series dreadfully moment. There is a stand off of sorts between the families of the hamlet Lark Rise and the families of the town Candleford. At a climatic moment they play music typical of American West &#34;showdown at high noon&#34; scene. Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints. This is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of L. M. Montgomery and Louisa May Alcott's works. It has the same feel.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I love this series. Offshoot of Dr. Who, entertaining in its own right. I started watching when Showtime brought it to America.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I saw the musical on Broadway last year and wanted the music for myself.  I found this CD and it has the majority of hits and all the songs from the musical.  If you like the Four Seasons you need this CD. It will bring back memories and have you singing from the first song.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Wish it was two episodes a week. Keep it rolling. Good job. Can't wait for the next season. Thanks guys
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great quick read. Makes you think about what goes on in the corners of life you glimpse as a shadow...
B005HEVBGG|3.0|the voices in one part of episode 3  cracked for a little bite. othere wise it was good still cant Waite to see the other
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Makes me sing every time I watch it!<br /><br />Fat Amy is so funny and the movie is just a feel good, slightly silly story.  But it's one I watch over and over again  :)
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Definitely a must read for Norwegians & readers of murder mystery.  Not for the light hearted reader or those seeking a romance story.
B0014LX420|3.0|Some of it is pretty good, and for $1.99 I shouldn't expect to be amazed. I should have previewed the tracks online before buying this. The collection is full of \\"Gerbil McDoof Remix\\" and some of the remixes are as dumb as what they're named. If you're expecting a BEST OF BRITNEY collection, pass on this. I should have used the restroom a couple hours ago, darn it just look at my bed! Ugh this number 2 stain might not come out with bleach. Also, lame remixes done in a studio isn't what I was wanting either. Frustrating!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is real time game it still plays when you don't. There US no pressure no time limits play and build at your own speed. You even get notices when something happens in the game .
B000LC55F2|5.0|When I first saw this movie I loved it,  but at the same time I was pretty confused,. Since then I have seen it like 10 times and it makes more and more sense each time. Not to mention the amazing acting by every character.  This will LITERALLY have you anywhere between the edge of your seat to an inch from the screen!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Bought this to digitize a large quantity of family pictures on 2 x 2 color slides, dating back to the early 1960's. Very simple to set up and use, with dependable results. Only drawback is that digitized data is stored on a card which then must be used to transfer to your computer. If there is a way to save direct to the computer, the instructions are not clear on the procedure.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Purchased another one because my phone uses the same cable and fits both phone and my Kindle. Good for the price
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great book with an incredible story.  I enjoyed ever page and learned a lot about world war two.  A must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is the best in the world idk how they came up with app but is the greatest hi mommy
B009O07NDY|5.0|I really like Howard Shore's music.  Some music was used before in the Ring Trilogy, but worked well in the Hobbit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|How to you uptade the game subway surfer please answer fast I want to play in Rome please write back
0765325950|4.0|The book finished for the series.  It told the final fates for the main characters in the story.  It ended on a hopeful note.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard so much about these books and people either LOVED them or hated them......passionately!  Those who didn't care for them seemed to always bring it down to the sex, and now that I've read all three books that is not AT ALL what the story is about.  It is a psychological thriller of the best sort, with the added benefit of being written in a locale where I live....which made it simply a fun read!  Well done E L James.  I am a fan!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Ddjxjcmxx and the first time since the first time since the first time since the same thing with you and I have been the same time since I was going through my mind and body to a lot about what they do it was the other yurt the other yurt to be able the other yurt and body is not responsible to be replaced for Goldwater control few da chord tv
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I just finished season 1 and 2! And it is the best show out there! I wish it was endless! But sadly there's only 6 seasons! If you've never watched it before you have to! It is an amazing show, that will make you want to keep watching it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read the authors other two novels before this one (Slammed, Point of Retreat). I was captivated by her sweet yet real characters. I had to read more of her work!<br />This novel is much darker and deep. The first half of the book moved a little slow for me. I didn't quite know where it was going and it seemed like just another teenage love story. I stuck with it tho and it was worth it. The second half of the book takes off with tons of drama and unexpected twists and turns. I feel so much sympathy for the main character, Sky. Her journey becomes more and more rough as she learns more about her past. The book left me feeling a bit dark and I definitely needed some cheering up after. I heard she may make this into a series as well so I look forward to it. I'm interested in seeing where Sky and Holder's relationship will go after this. After all they've been thru in this journey together I want a happy ending!
B000L9OCEK|5.0|Arrived right on time and I'm overall satisfied. There are no scratches on the disc, and I very much appreciate the fact that it had been cleaned and played before being sent.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I still cannot believe this is Colleen Hoover's debut. The writing suggests an author who's written several novels already. Her talent is undeniable and I look forward to each and every one of her works to follow.<br /><br />I loved the character development and how sweet the story was. So many love stories these days have nothing but sex throughout (not that I'm complaining) but this one focuses more on the little details. Loved it.<br /><br />Make sure to also read Point of Retreat to get Will's point of view. It's very refreshing to look back on the things that happened in this first book and see what Will thought about it. Her novel Hopeless is good as well but it's much deeper and darker. Not as upbeat as Slammed and POR. 5 stars all around!
B003Y5H5EW|2.0|I loved the first movie, great stuff. The second movie not quite as much, though they did a good job with the brothers' scariness. This third movie felt like they needed some quick money, so they punched out a quick movie. There being a child thrown in really made it seem like they were leaving the door open for more Underworld movies. When in the mood I'll have a little Underworld retrospective and watch the first 2 Underworld movies back to back. I am not even going to bother buying Awakening unless it gets to a price low enough that I can rationalize it as completing a series. Sorry Kate.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Edge of the set book. It has allot of ways you can imagine it could end. But in the long run they we're meant for each other. Both had to face reality to make each other realize how much they were meet to be together
B007URVZJ6|4.0|No info on margin widths?<br /><br />Confusion about separation of images and text into two files. How do images  get inserted where I want them?<br /><br />Otherwise, clear info. But missing key info makes the book murky.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a very interesting and well developed show. I love it, and I can't stop watching it. Great job
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had purchased this book, and its' companions in the series, some time ago but finally got a chance to read them on a month long vacation in Belize.  I was surprised at how engrossing the series was ... I could barely put any of the three books down until I was finished.  A fun ride and recommended.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I could never use it, but it is ok, it was free so I did not lose anything about it
0553381407|5.0|I am halfway through this book and I will say that much of the subject matter really hits the head on the nail for me - almost like having a therapist in a book!<br /><br />Well written, concise and easy to read, I do very much suggest that this book goes on your reading list if you've had a rather tumultuous upbringing and find yourself feeling &#34;stuck&#34; as an adult.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is a great movie! Fun for the whole family! We own the first Expendables and knew the second one would be a great movie as well! This movie is full of action, fun and will keep you on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />We have movie night every weekend and we knew what movie we wanted to watch for our movie night. This movie did not disappoint and will not disappoint you! Our older children even loved this movie!<br /><br />The whole cast is awesome! Bring back more movies like this! Great wonderful job to the whole cast. Thank you for making movies that we can share with our children and we all can enjoy real movie time.<br /><br />Our children were glued to the Expendables! They were so into each character. It was fun to give them the history on each of the characters. It is nice to see the action hero's together from the decades.<br /><br />Past action hero's were great in the past and are even greater today! I don't know what the negative reviews are talking about, what is not to like about this movie?<br /><br />It's great action hero's still making great movies for many to enjoy! If you pass this movie up you will miss out on some great action!<br /><br />Veterans are the best! It's nice to see good movies like this being made instead of the trash that is on the screens now days.<br /><br />Many will soon learn the old way is the best way.. You can take some lessons from the Expendables!<br /><br />Exciting to see Terry Crews, Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, and all of the whole cast! Great movie! We will watch this movie over and over!<br /><br />Bring on Expendables 3!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I like being able to use it WITHOUT internet connection via cell service or wifi.  This is the top feature I liked.  To be able to browse a map without connecting to my cell service or even a WIFI.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I missed season 2 and low and behold Amazon Prime had it!!  It is intriguing and captivating!  Its a refreshing break from all the graphic sex and violence on TV.  Its done tastefully!
076780421X|5.0|This is a true gem of a movie. The most I can say is .....Matthew(OH MY GOD) Perry!!!!!!  He is a very good, and funny young man
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Lots of fun. There is lots of fan service that at times seems overboard but it is always fun with &#34;boing boing&#34; sounds added. Its hard to explain how the creators did such a great job. There are jokes that only nerd culture will understand. For example i laughed at the &#34;I Like turtles&#34; line used from the hit youtube video.
030796664X|1.0|Definitely not for the casual reader looking for easy ideas. Too much statistic talk and case histories. I didn't even get through it.
B0058RN85O|3.0|The show is great but i decided to buy Blu-ray, after all its the new thing. The player that i have will only play the first disc. The disc has a program that keeps track of which episode you are on and i think that program is causing problems. I have to watch this on my computer and even then it take around five min to load. Do you have a new blu-ray player? If not, buy the dvd. There is that chance that i got a bad disc two and three but they do work on the PC but they take forever to load. Sometimes they time out.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great writing.  This navy seal is a true hero.  It's amazing he survived.  I would highly recommend this to the people who have read No Easy Day.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is a fun game but could always be better, therefore I only give it 4 stars and that is all.
B008I34ZFW|3.0|Like the title says... It's a B movie. But it does have its fun moments. I would watch it again.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is actually a pretty fun distraction and the various levels keep it interesting and playable over the long run.
B007V65R54|5.0|I'm no math whiz but I am a market researcher and have always been infuriated at the occasionally obvious misuse of statistics,  without really knowing how to defend my point of view to the technocrats.  This book totally made my argument as well as all the others.  I especially loved his observation (seconded by me) that people who love numbers think that factors that can't be quantified don't count.  Wrong!  And Nate tells exactly why, in terms they (and I) could understand.  I love you, Nate!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My whole family enjoyed this movie which is rare.(11 yr. old boy, 15 yr. old girl, my wife who wouldn't want me to put her age, and me a 38 yr. old man)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game with awesome graphics. I love it! Its a quality game. I love it. The new update in Rome is so cool. I wish they would do one in Russia with a guard chasing u in snow
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|I have taken a liking to this game! Always had a thing for boat, ships and ocean water, right down to the salty air and smell of seaweed! Family had a Cabin Cruiser back in the 60's and 70's and miss those fun filled days. The only bad part is just when I get to having a lot of fun with it, it all goes proof back to the movie and lobster on the Captain's back! Poor guy! I do like this game big time even when I have to restart it! Now back to the cove! Ahoy!
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I've been interested in the work of Director / Writer Scott Derrickson since hearing he was a Christian many years back. I was fascinated to find someone else who shared not only my basic religious beliefs but also had a passion for the horror and science fiction genres I love so much. It's not often you hear of Christians who are successful in Hollywood.<br /><br />Derrickson has an impressive resume of films and actors he's worked with over the years. His early endeavors consist of writing &#34;Urban Legends: Final Cut&#34; and directing and penning &#34;Hellraiser: Inferno.&#34; He moved on to take the helm of &#34;The Day the Earth Stood Still&#34; and &#34;The Exorcism of Emily Rose.&#34; Both of these films starred well-respected actors like Keanu Reeves, Laura Linney, and Tom Wilikinson. His latest film &#34;Sinister&#34; ranks at the top of his filmmaking career.<br /><br />True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) gained notoriety ten years ago with a book about a grisly murder. After a couple unsuccessful novels, Oswald is looking to repeat his success and return to the top of the bestseller list. He takes up residence in the home where the victims he's investigating actually lived and were killed.<br /><br />While moving in, he discovers a box of Super 8 movies which hold footage of several brutal murders that he believes somehow tie together. As Oswald digs deeper into each crime, his world begins to crumble around him. Is he losing his sanity or is there a supernatural force out to get him and his family?<br /><br />&#34;Sinister&#34; is the culmination of everything good about several horror sub-genres. You have the &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; found footage concept covered through the use of the Super 8 films. People who enjoy movies with supernatural entities like the ones in &#34;The Grudge,&#34; &#34;Boogeyman,&#34; and others of that nature will enjoy it. Those who crave modern day ghost stories like &#34;The Pact,&#34; &#34;The Apparition,&#34; and &#34;Insidious&#34; will love it as well. There really is something for every type of horror enthusiast in &#34;Sinister.&#34;<br /><br />The movie isn't a sloppy hodge-podge of those movies, either. Derrickson ties everything together with a script that makes sense and a story that is well-paced and intriguing. It has slow-burning suspense and jump-scares combined together to keep you on the edge of your seat and nervously awaiting the next disturbing scene.<br /><br />Several special features are included in the DVD version of &#34;Sinister.&#34; There are two separate audio commentaries featuring Director / Writer Scott Derrickson and Co-writer C. Robert Cargill. It also contains two featurettes entitled &#34;True Crime Authors&#34; and &#34;Living in a House of Death.&#34; Deleted scenes include optional audio commentary by Director Scott Derrickson. Lastly, we get a trailer for the film.<br /><br />&#34;Sinister&#34; is a satisfying horror film which will appeal to many types of fright fans. It's a successful combination of old and new tricks. When it comes to what we see onscreen, it has more in common with Hitchcock than it does gorier fare like &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; and the likes. Viewers who like a twisty storyline which leaves something for your imagination visually will enjoy &#34;Sinister.&#34;#34; and &#34;Insidious&#34; will love it as well.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I totally reccomend this game to everybody it is awesome really download it and try it this game is completely. Worth it all the way.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|BEST show I Have EVER seen....I watch every episode as soon as the new one comes out. It definitely keeps you entertained
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves this app. I would of giving it a 5 but it costs money to make good progress in the game. My money! Otherwise it a lot of fun for her.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I listen. I sing. I smile.  I dance in the kitchen. I listen again. I join  Andrea or Edith Piaf , singing, and dancing around the living room!  Over and over.  It's the first time, wherever I listen!  Such timeless songs !
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids giggled so much their cheeks hurt.  child humor and adult humor all rolled into one.  great movie, and appropriate for all ages...
B000GCFY0I|3.0|Really great idea for a story, but could not get past the juvenile writing. Yes this is a young adult book, but it was so childish at times that I had a hard time getting through it. Not sure if I will continue the series, to be honest the only real motivation I had to finish the book was so that I could start something different.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Clever, cynical about earthly behaviour. His words imply that bad is 100 percent bad. A more hopeful person might say that things are sometimes  only 10 percent infected.<br />It is obvious that the pleasures he sought in his earlier life were not fulfilling. How he sees his future and 'after death' is less clear.<br /><br />Rex Smith
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Enjoyed this dvd emensely as it was different and fun - recommending to my friends.  Reasonably prices and shipped quickly.
B0084670FU|2.0|It gave the lives of 3 entirely different people, speaking 3 different languages...There was no tie to each other until the movie was 90% over  Brad Pitt had only a very small part of the movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Enjoyed this very much - came quickly and worked perfectly - no dissappointments here!  Ready for Season 4 when it is available.
B00005K3OT|4.0|All star cast in this wickedly funny movie about a single mother who opens a chocolate shop in an italian village during Lent. Johnny Depp is a wandering gypsy type who wins her heart. All the stars do an awesome job. Great addition to the library.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Once I started playing I couldn't get back to the home screen.  I had to write this review just to get out of the game. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So glad they came out with this app for the tablet. Works on my Nabi2 just fine. Quick downloads and lots of books to choose from. Thanks Amazon!
B0018TLRTK|5.0|If you grew up with Mr. Idol it's a must have... I bought it and it's great.. Sounds great, for a great price! Can't go wrong..
B004UPALT6|1.0|It's no evil dead 1. I could not get through the first 30 minutes. I know it's a horror comedy but they should have kept this one buried in the forest
B000BBOV8U|5.0|This is a must for anyone that grew up with Bryan Adams.. It had a few songs I never heard so that was a plus..
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great show with fantastic characters that I have fallen in love with. I plan on buying season 3 even though I have seen it. Its rare to find a show as wonderful as this
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I'm a fan of Thomas Newman - I love his music. However, I couldn't get behind him when I hear he was scoring Skyfall. He hadn't written much action material, except some in Lemony Snicket. Well, boy can I say I'm putting my foor in my mouth! He has written some damn fine music for the 50th anniversary of James Bond. Standout tracks include : Grand Baazar, Istanbul; The Bloody Shot!; Enjoying Death, The Chimera, Someone Usually Dies, Jellyfish, Quartermaster, Voluntary Retirement, Skyfall, Granborough Road, New Digs, She's Mine, and Deep Water. Yes, I realize that was most of the score, but it was hard to choose when there's around 31 tracks on a score, and each one is a ton of fun. I did really miss David Arnold - I adore his scores for Bond, but think he really stepped up his game for the first two Craig entries. Oh, and for those who are complaining about the lack of Adele's theme on there- you can buy it for a dollar on its own cd. For some reason, that has been something that plagued two out of the three scores for Craig's Bond. However, that shouldn't be a detractor from the music itself. Overall, should Mendes come back, and Bring Newman with him, I would be a happy fellow. If not, bring back David Arnold.
B000002LOE|3.0|I was not familiar with the group R. E. M. and purchased this CD predomanently for one song. The song that I liked is very good, but the rest of the album is not exactly my cup of tea. This is not the fault of the seller and the CD was delivered in a timely manner.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. Extremely well done by Dave Grohl. Getting to hear the history that the sound board was a part of was very interesting. So many great bands!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love playing this game. Each level unique and fun. Keeps you entertained and the movements are smooth and everything is easy to use.  love this version of the classic game.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Full review from Film Phreak! Visit us at filmphreak.tumblr.com<br />SINISTER is an amazing balance of traditional film storytelling and the found footage motif. Of course, ever since Blair Witch (and revitalized with Paranormal Activity) there has been an unceasing gush of found footage flicks. Now, that may be an issue for some, but not for me. I like the genre overall. Not that there aren’t bad versions of the conceit but the genre as a whole isn’t trash, it just requires patience and an appreciation for the “slow burn”, a phrase I’ve seen bandied about SINISTER. Not every horror movie is about shock and awe - for the record, I LIKE shock and awe horror - and the found footage genre, while it does depend on shock, gets its shocks from atmosphere and flashes of terror rather than by unleashing horror weapons of mass dismemberment. As it happens, there are a number of gruesome murders as part of SINISTER’s sinister story but there are shown, but obliquely, suggested askew with cinematographic techniques, more than hints, peeks, perhaps, of the violence that is part and parcel of SINISTER. But with SINISTER what’s important is knowing that these things happened, not seeing it in gory detail. It ain’t that kinda movie. SINISTER is about building tension while being creepy in tone right from the start. It’s a build that has as much hook as anything in the [name of torture porn[ franchise. It’s not the same kinda movie, but it’s as suspense filled as John Carpenter’s “Halloween” and - dareIsayit?yesIdaresayit - and is qualitatively every bit as good. It’s one of the scariest of the found footage movies, ranking right up there with my favorites, such as VHS and GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 1 & 2. But, as I mentioned, this is not only found footage, but a blend. I’m going to say little about the plot, for both spoiler reasons and the fact that I’m not a plot regurgitator/synopsis-book-report kinda critic. I’ll say this much: The found footage is grafted perfectly into the normal cinematic narrative by way of reels of home movies containing distressing and murderous footage; these reels are integral to the plot. Ethan Hawke is a true crime writer trying to keep his family together as well as struggling to write another bestseller (his last one came out years ago) to keep his family afloat. He’s driven and the family move into the house where the crimes occurred that Hawke is writing about places great stress on family members and … well, let’s just say it’s nice to have some REAL drama incorporated into a horror movie. We need it. It invests us in the family and in this film, that’s vital for the movie to conjure fear. But  I was talking about the mix of found footage and regular filmmaking. The reels of “home movies” turn up in the attic of the house and become the rabbit hole down which Hawke drags himself and his loved ones. This one goes on my DVD rack of awesome favorite horror movies.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Bought this for our grandaughter.  We enjoyed watching the movie and sharing the \\"Mary Poppins\\" experience with her. Excellent choice!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is fun and a time killer when needed.  It works fine on my devices and I have had no problems with it.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Very good and suspensful.  I can see what the hype was about.  Will be looking for Season 2 to continue the journey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting and fun to play. Have a hard time putting it down. Great way to kill some extra time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game. I really have to get us to Rome. I love the colors. It's very exciting. I have only been using the game for six weeks. It really challenging me.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Vinyl -&#62; cassette tapes -&#62; CDs -&#62; DVDs -&#62; Blu-Ray. I just keep buying the white album over and over.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesomeness is this book get it trust me it's awesome so it doesn't wast your money just buy  Ok  so cool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway suffers is the best game ever. Its the best game on my device. I also like how the places change like new York and all of them. But can you add more things
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My favorite author is John Grisham, other than his books there are few that keep my interest. This book does that. It is very well written and you hate to have to put it down because you need to know what is going to happen next.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Every little girl needs to see this movie.  It's a &#34;coming of age&#34; movie the entire family can enjoy!  And THEY WILL;-)
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show can't wait till next season<br />I have to write 13 more  words so here are some words to make you happy
1849025975|5.0|In 1936 George Orwell, author of 1984 and Animal Farm, was sent to Spain to report on the Spanish Civil War. Upon arriving there he did the only thing sensible to him at the time, he took up arms with the anarchist militia against the fascist army of Francisco Franco. Orwell took the role of a soldier-reporter in which he wrote a book about his experiences, Homage to Catalonia.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the dynamics of revolutionary history or Anarchism, this is one book that cannot be missed. Orwell recounts the entire ordeal beginning with joining the militia to narrowly escaping Spain during the political meltdown in a way that would make James Bond cream his tuxedo. Orwell's recount is told with his signature charm, irony, and wit. It's not often that we get to read a war book written by literary master who was actually there in the trenches. His first-hand accounts of combat put you right next to him crawling on your belly through mud and barb wire. You feel the panic of the communication lines breaking down in the midst of enemy fire, and the savagely cold nights with hardly a wick light to keep warm. Orwell portrayal of the petty infighting between anti-fascist forces will make the reader cross their head at the absurdity of war.<br /><br />This isn't a book that celebrates the glory of the battle field. It is harsh retelling of what it was like to be there in the madness. We get to see the transformation of Orwell starting off as wide-eyed man romanticized by the armed struggle, only to finish off disillusioned by the destruction, propaganda, and deadly ego battles. The relevancy of this book is at a fevered pitch in these modern times, but it's a scream that is drowned out in the awesome flood of waving flags and avalanching politics.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|If you're familiar with Enya's music, this is just more of the same. The same beautiful voice... the same wonderful, soothing music... the same ethereal melodies. Some of her best songs from the past couple of decades, all in one collection, and well-worth the buying! :)
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I had heard a couple of songs on the radio by Imaging Dragons and decided I wanted to hear the rest of their music. I'm glad I bought the CD because it's one I can leave on repeat.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't stop reading! Loved each character! Can't wait to find out what happens next!<br /><br />Definitely recommend reading this book & plan to read again.
0307591549|5.0|As a student of this subject,  I can honestly  say that Achor knows what he's writing about and makes it easy to understand.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This had little to no plot and was not even worth the guys dancing on screen...when there was actual dancing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|A Very good movie!  I wanted to see it before the Oscars airing later that day to see what \\"the talk\\" was about.  Glad that I did!!!lSuspenseful, wonderfully casted and superbly directed. Did I say suspenseful?! I would definitely watch it again.
B00136NUG6|5.0|What can I say! Great music from the Disco Era!<br />Lots of good vibes and lyrics.<br />Great sounds to move to or for anything else.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a great game.  I just wish there was a game that you don't have to pay.  But then people wouldn't make money.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It's ok,but I don,t really like how it is set up on the Kindle.I haven't had any problems using it though
B0036UO56G|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is a 70's classic! Probably NOT for everyone, but I Love It! Esther Hoffman (Barbara Streisand) and John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson)are polar opposites with a love for mucic and each other.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Awsome, awsome, awsome dvd...great behind the scenes and lots of info on the incredible band that is Iron Maiden...Highly recommend to all Maiden fans!!!
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The hinge structure for the DVD sleeves arrived with some of the hinge pins broken.  The sleeved discs do not sit properly in the binder.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|Tho the game is very pretty.  It's like they took a premade screen saver &amp; put some planks in it.  The controls are difficult to adjust to since they lag at certain points &amp; depth is difficult to tell.  If you fall, the ball take forever to fall without being able to bypass it.  It's far too repetitive for me.
B00130UFY2|5.0|This is a great movie that really makes you think about the CIA, its role in government affairs and the way in which it trains people to be assassins, as well as, their impact in the world.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I started reading Michael Connelly books a year ago and continue to enjoy them.  They are all good reading that are hard to put down
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and easy to see. One I won't loose since it is on my kindle. I love it.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|What can i say. They work. You put them in things that need them and they power up. The end.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Season 8 of Smallville was my 2nd best favorite after the 10th season. Louis and Clark finally start showing some feelings around the edges and Chloe sacrifices so much for Clark and his secret! Really good season!
0345803493|5.0|This is essentially a well plotted and written  romance novel spiced up with some (fairly innocuous) s and m material. Although the leading male character was not really believable, the leading female character from whose perspective the whole novel is written was funny and her seduction and later development are plausibly invoked. The sex scenes (which are so numerous that the author must have been as exhausted as her characters)  are convincing, titilating and often ingenious.  It could have been one book and presumably was divided into three volumes to generate more income. All three volumes were comparable in quality.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I absolutely loved the 10th season of Smallville! It kept me on my toes the whole time! The ending of this season wasn't rushed and neither did it suck!
0345803507|5.0|See remarks on the other volumes which are all similar in content and quality and are essentially the same novel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Started to watch this show late in Season 3. Had to go back and then watch Season 1 and 2 and the 3 episodes of Season 3 that weren't available on Xfinity. So glad I did. I love this show....GO DARYL!
B003CYKCHW|1.0|Got this mouse thinking it was going to be good. The feeling of the mouse feels good but has a bunch of software problems. This mouse drivers don't work correctly on windows 7 64 bit home premium. Games get a tone of mouse lag and had to keep reinstalling the drivers and rebooting to get the drivers to work. Though when you shut it down and start up again the mouse is broken again! Also you can't change the polling rates in the software either which is is a must for gaming mice. Over all crappy drivers and a waste of my time. Returned it to the store and got a Logitech G400 instead. Works great and has a 1000 polling rate like this mouse and can change the polling rate in there software. Also has high dpi settings like this one did but actually works unlike this horrible mouse. I say save your money and get a different mouse. Totally recommend logitechs gaming mice. Good quality and they actually work and there drivers are great. Works great in my games unlike this terrible cyborg mouse. All in all I would not recommend this mouse to any one and say to get a mouse made by Logitech instead which are quality and work correctly.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Great savings (compared to Wal Mart & Best Buy), great product.  You've made a Supernatural fan very happy & satisfied.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|It's full of good acting, strong writing, funny antics - what more could you ask for?  Chuck is totally a nerd and the characters at the Buy More are a hoot!

0061537969|5.0|This was a reading assignment for my son for his English class at school.  It was really nice to be able to purchase it online for a fraction of the retail cost & from the comfort of home.
B0000695JP|1.0|I was unable to watch it because I did not know that region 2  next to the title meant that I couldn't use it in my dvd in the US.  I didn't even think about overseas products.
0345803485|5.0|i m now in middle of book 2 and i start getting bored of repeated scenes of the same kind. however, to be fair, book 1 is really indulging and i cant stop reading it. i hope book 3 would be better
0124297854|5.0|I ordered this to use as a reference in my advanced synthesis course, as well as a reference in the lab.  This book has been quite an asset in both instances.  I highly recommend this to any synthetic organic chemist or grad student alike.
B005I4JG80|5.0|This book was funny and well written, full of great insight and common sense parenting philosophies. Also gives a fun look at living in Paris. [...]
1582701709|1.0|This continues the WRONG idea of TRUTH !!!!!!!  This is directly connected with the WRONG type of Thinking !<br />This takes out the very connection you need to find the real truth and proper path to follow.<br />This WILL NOT HELP YOU ONTO THE CORRECT PATH IN LIFE !!!!!!<br />This WILL LEAD TO THE WRONG SIDE OF POWER and ultimate DISTRUCTION of your INNER FULLFILMENT !!!<br />I would only read this to know what to AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|a bizarre movie about nazis invading earth from the dark side of the moon. I thought the movie was strange but I liked it and would recommend to anyone who likes sci-fi and or military.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I LOVE it. The only plart i dont like is when that dumb dog barks and barks annoying
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My friend has this same app but it's an older version. But there's no updates available although we only got the app 3 days apart. Other than that, I don't have any complaints. If you love horse's and like to take care of them and enter in competitions then I would recommend this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was a great show to watch. Loved seeing how everyone lived back in that time. Was surprised how certain stories ended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Does not really follow the comics I am told, but it is still.a really good show for us sci-fi buffs!
B0083Z614S|4.0|A magical and life affirming book. I found this book to be light and easy to read but also rather profound and meaningful. It really gets you thinking about life, friendship and the way that our social interactions and thought patterns are so important to our development as healthy individuals. The garden symbolises this development and the very 'nature of nature' which is always changing, growing and amazing... A superbly well written book which has really stood the test of time.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|must have for any anime fan great buy for the price great for any collection great story and anime a must buy
B000AJIF4E|5.0|They're inexpensive.  They sound fantastic.  They're incredibly comfortable.  What more do you need?  Buy them.<br /><br />If you're a 17 year old kid, remember, beats by dre can suck it.  These are what you want.  They sound clean, clear and crisp.  Plus, they're 250 dollars cheaper! Be smart and buy them already.
6304493681|5.0|one of the best anime i've seen i remember seeing for the first time bring back me back but a must buy
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed learning about the other tributes and districts. Almost wish the story was not written in first person, so we could learn even more.
1451627297|4.0|11-22-63 is a very good Stephen King novel: It's a real page-turner at times -- absolutely captivating -- and yet at other times it's plodding and padded. King is one of America's most skilled writers, and like all writers, he needs a good editor. His description of small-town life, and murder, in Maine in 1958 is riveting, but the high school play in Jodie, Texas, reads like Nicholas Sparks. Still, King's plotting is delightful, his imagination is mindblowing, and much of his writing, including the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, can take you away from wherever you are, which is the mark of a great book.<br />  As I endured (or skipped) King's typical excesses, and raced through the book, I loved meeting the people King describes, the good guys and the bad guys. I thought: I wish he knew more good guys, and I wish he'd write more about them and not just the horrible things that happen to them.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Disappointed. Katniss came off as a whiner, not shell-shocked. Why anybody would follow her into battle let alone behind enemy lines is unthinkable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very awesome, fun, and addictive game! You will get lost in the trains! Trying to complete the challenges are great! The prizes just keep getting better and better!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am not much of a sci fi fan. This is a great sci fi survivalist story best .99cents I've ever spent.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was an amazing book. This book made me slightly angry at the end (I won't tell why, but those of you who read it can figure it out) but it also drove me close to tears. It's a sad story with an interesting point of view. I would highly recommend this book. You should also read  The Diary of Anne Frank. Reading the two books will make you wonder.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I could not stop playing. The hints are great because it is a challenging game.  Great storyline.  Big Fish Games are the best!
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is a good app . I love it u can talk to lots of people. U can talk to new people . But the only thing I don`t like is because u can`t without
B007SGM084|4.0|I'm not a romance reader at all and was very surprised with the kinky parts, but this trilogy was very well written. The storyline was very good, held my interest all the way to the end, as a person that never reads any type of romance or love stories, I have to say \\"It was one of the better reads, a real page turner!\\"
B006BDHAX0|5.0|really enjoy the challenge of this game!  Would reccomend this for anyone who enjoys mahjong games.  It is lots of fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Freezes a lot especially while feeding and during competition which sucks cause it deducted the energy before u start so u have to wait even longer for more energy but all around awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. Especially the end because  I can't wait to read the next book! It was very tense and I couldn't get my eyes off of it :) I highly recommend it!
B007T99ENE|4.0|A bit of a literary name dropper but entertaining. Characters well drawn and believable especially naive heroine. The question remains didn't MI5 have better things to spend money on?
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It has been a fun game to play. Definitely worth the money.I  am only in India so far and haven't been stuck yet.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was interesting. I loved the ending. I can't wait for the next one, I can't wait for the wedding.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. It drove me crazy but also kept me on my toys to continue reading. Abby and Travis were right for each other from the beginning. I couldn't get enough.
B0054S6N04|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  The lead characters were awesome - a huge plus, no whiny helpless female, she was strong, smart and funny, and the male lead was her perfect match.  This book had it all....great characters, humor, mystery....in a word, 'perfect!'
B00AU15HPC|3.0|Well,having been a JH + MB's fan since high school in the late 60's (on open reel, mind you) this album by Justin is a let-down.  The first six songs are refreshing but simple reminders of why a lot of us fans followed Justin, John, Graeme, Ray (and Mike) on Eternity Road these last 40 some years.  The final songs on Western Sky were either rehashes of previously recorded songs or someone's fiendish plot to lure Justin into techno-rock Hades.  Run, Justin, run!  Follow the Love and do another Blue Jays styled album with your tried and true singing partner John Lodge next time around.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I am addicted to this series!  The characters are endearing and the settings are lovely and quaint.  Another great one from the BBC!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Works well in my gaming rig on my Gigabyte motherboard. I don't have to worry about the limitations that AMD chips have.  At the same time, this cost more.  I got this version, but haven't overclocked it yet.  Hopefully being able to overclock it will future proof my system a tiny bit.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I did not like the fact the an advertisement for a dating site kept poping up, I felt it was not appropriate
B007R21JJK|5.0|This board is awesome, I used it as the foundation for a medium priced gaming rig ($1500 total rig).  It's beautiful, has a nice UEFI setup, the lettering on the black board is easy to see, and all my components plugged in with no fuss.  The instructions that came with it are clear.  It has USB 3.0, but i only have one or two USB 3.0 devices even in 2013, so I wold rather have more USB 2.0 ports.  Built in sound is good quality.  I have no complaints.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Was fun to play...wish it was longer.Looking forward to more games like this.Will tell my friends about it.Good fun and thanks.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|One of the most intense, hard hitting, real, emotional, inspiring, hit you where you live right smack dab in the face movies I've ever seen in my entire life & that's saying alot as big as a movie collector I am. You're a fool not to at least give it try, cause I can pretty much almost guarantee, you'll at least like it, if not, love it. It's your loss if you don't see it. Also, considering this is the first time I've actually taken the time to put in the effort to actually review a movie on Amazon, that should tell you something.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|The quality of the seven dvd's was perfect.  Much better than watching it on television.  I will enjoy it for a long time.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Always appreciated Richard Thomson's amazing talent as a singer, guitarist and songwriter.  His latest offering rates up there with the best of his work. Five stars.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is a very well played and well written story. You find yourself feeling for the characters both in humor and sympathy. Bitter sweet but no tears, plenty of chuckles.  I also enjoyed the book and loved the movie even though I read the book.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I've heard a few things from Josh, but nothing that made me want to be an active listener.  I wouldn't turn anything off when I heard him, but I never thought to purchase anything either.  I listened to a few of the tracks when someone told me about this album.  I had to buy it.  I love it!  Brave, Falling Slowly, and I Believe are my favorites so far.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great book. I almost felt like I had walked the PCT. my lite backpacking experience helped me relate. Truly an inspiring story.makes you rethink what life is really about
B00AN0K5KW|1.0|THERE ARE TEN EPISODES in season two. Priced at $2.99 each I can buy them individually or together at relatively the same price. Come on Amazon... give me a deal
B001LMAK88|5.0|This is a great movie with some great actors in it.  The storyline was good and the movie was interesting and excfiting.<br />One that you can watch over and over again.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I love this show! It's one of the best...I am disappointed it is no longer on. The story line of the first season was my favorite...but they kept the show alive and suspenseful throughout its airing.
0800141601|5.0|Not only are the actors in here amazing at how they portray their characters but I just love them as actors,  they really brought great feeling to the movie.  this one i love watching again and again.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|It took some time for me to fully appreciate this score. Ultimately, i feel that the score for prometheus is appropriate and complementary to the image/film as well as expressive and enjoyable as a standalone collection of music. I find myself listening to this disc regularly. Beautiful score for a beautiful film. recommended.
B000TVBIYC|5.0|My Grandson and son love these they have played legos for quite a while and having the switch trak pleases my son
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. I literally do not pay anything else but this whenever i get onto my kindle
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Amazing!  The fact that this is based on actual events is nothing short of beyond belief. From beginning to end you will be on the end of your seat.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|get this app! it is so fun if you like fun get it I am short you will like it some levels are hard tho but you can do it GET IT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Couldn't put it down and the storyline was good. Lots of love stories are so,,,,ordinary. This one is great.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|This is a acton packed, well scripted exciting adventure with Tom Cruise as the pilot.  The music certainly adds to the excitement and Kelly McGills and Tom Cruise have great chemistry.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds gets me every time...whether they are the original, funny characters (star wars, disney), I love the different levels, different challenges. Not to mention the kindle has a great screen for games!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved it .....If you have not seen it please do ......It was a great movie all the way to the end!!!!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a great way to pass the time. I have this version downloaded on my laptop, kindle and phone. Better than just the regular ol solitaire
B001P1MZNI|2.0|I do like Sinatra's music, but this album has too much banter, his less than clever, less than funny, cutesy chat.  There is also sycophantic audience response that I find annoying.  I wish I could return this album, glad it was so inexpensive.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always a classic, this one doesnt disappoint. Im a huge fan of card games and even better on the kindle
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A good addition to the Pendergast series.  I enjoyed the authors moving each character along.  A bit far-fetched, but it has Nazis!  How can you go wrong with Nazis?  All in all, the this book has the type of mystery and crazy scientific-sounding stuff that us fans of Pendergast come to expect and enjoy.  A good purchase!
0312360266|5.0|This is the first of 7 or 8 books and I highly reccommend them. Not as sappy as the Twilight series and a little more teen, gives these books a nice twist on the vampire series that are out there now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun... but be aware this game is extremely addictive!<br />I'm not one to get addicted. To video games, but this one takes the cake!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It has been such a long time since I downloaded this onto my kindle, I cannot remember if its the original or not?! Either way, its an angry birds game so you know its great!
B008LCRAC0|5.0|Worth the money. Loved all 9 seasons! I miss this show terribly! Come baaaacccckkkk! Well, I do also miss Northern Exposure lol
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this! Bright pink, neoprene feel to the cover, has strap to cover the front--what more do you need in a case?! I also love that the back becomes a support to stand it up if needed!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The next book better be out soon.<br />The suspense is already killing me.<br />This book was absolutely amazing.<br />Five stars.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the fact that I could buy all 3 books for practically the price of one! This is such a great series and cant wait to see the movies!
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I bought this movie because of the actors in it. So phony, horrible acting, just plain rediculous! I'd love to give it back!!!!
B0098460O4|5.0|These two are so good, it is a joy to listen to their music, thank you for offering such a great c.d.!
B0058YPL66|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only complaint I have is....please...do something about Snow's horrible hairstyle! On some women it looks cute...not on her. She's just too cornballish!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are unique and real at the same time.  The people are real as they go through their lives doing the right thing or look at everything from their personal view.  The relationship between the Sherif and Bear remind me of the excellent Tony Hillmerman series.  They are different in time and place and personality but the feel is remenisence of Mr. Hillerman. Another new author for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game. I enjoy playing it.Subway surfer is a great to play when taking a break from class or homework.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved the imagery and characters. Wish the heroine had just a little more gusto, but great story over all. Must read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think I have a crazy addiction for this! This is one of the best games I have ever played! Thanks!
1451620829|2.0|Peter Criss talked about releasing this book for something like two and a half decades. And when it finally came out, it was a long awaited counterweight to the Simmons/Stanley version of the Kiss story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this story is so colored by bitterness towards his former bandmates, you really have to take a lot of Criss' statements and stories with more than a grain of salt. What baffles me most is how he seems to absolve himself of nearly all the responsibility for the bad things that happened to him, and to be fair, there's been a lot of bad things in his life. You get a few \\"that was a stupid move\\" remarks, but there's always some kind of excuse to go with it. The drugs, getting fired from Kiss, divorces, financial straits, bad decisions.. The whole book seems like a quest for sympathy, and to be honest, it backfires. Criss comes off as an delusional moaner more often than not.<br /><br />I can understand some of the resentment he has towards Stanley, Simmons and even Frehley, they don't seem easy to work with at all. But the way he expresses that resentment makes him come off like an angry, overly emotional child at times, willing to do anything just to be able to take a stab at them (especially Stanley and Simmons).<br /><br />Anyways, the read itself is fairly amusing, though he goes into great detail when it's REALLY not necessary on more than one occasion. And if he's managed to worsen my impression of Stanley and Simmons even more (which is very hard), he's also ruined the impression of himself in the process.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was amazing!  Sad to read after his death. I'm glad I read it! I would highly recommend this book!
B000A2GREQ|5.0|I guess this is the only compilation album by the Police that I can actually rate 5/5, simply because it delivers exactly what it's supposed to. This features all their greatest hits (unlike the 1986 collection, which leaves out a few), thus the title. Not \\"the best of\\", not \\"the definitive collection\\", which would make fans point out that it's lacking whatever favorite deep cuts they all feel should be included.. This one's got its focus solely on the actual HITS.. well, almost, anyway, but we'll get to that in a second. Anyways, the tracks are presented in chronological order as far as albums go:<br /><br />From Outlandos d'Amour:<br />1: Roxanne<br />2: Can't Stand Losing You<br />3: So Lonely<br /><br />From Regatta de Blanc:<br />4: Message in a Bottle<br />5: Walking on the Moon<br />6: Bed's Too Big Without You<br /><br />From Zenyatta Mondatta:<br />7: Don't Stand So Close To Me<br />8: De Do Do Do De Da Da Da<br /><br />From Ghost in the Machine:<br />9: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic<br />10: Invisible Sun<br />11: Spirits In The Material World<br /><br />From Synchronicity:<br />12: Synchronicity II<br />13: Every Breath You Take<br />14: King of Pain<br />15: Wrapped Around Your Finger<br />16: Tea in the Sahara<br /><br />Ah, yes, Tea in the Sahara.. NOT a hit, not even a single, as far as I know. Nevertheless a fan favorite and a classic. But it makes you wonder why it was included here, cause all the other tracks were hit singles. In fact, the collection contains nearly every single they ever put out. So why did they include this deep cut from Synchronicity? And if they included that one, why not include other fan favorites like When The World Is Running Down.. and Demolition Man? Tea in the Sahara is the odd man out. I suspect Sting really likes the song, though, and even though it wasn't a hit, I just consider it a nice bonus to an otherwise glorious parade of pure hits.<br /><br />This is a brilliant introduction to the Police, as you get ALLthe hits (how many times have i said that now?), as well as a fair taste of every album, put in chronological order (sort of) so that you can hear the sonic evolution from album to album. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a Police collection, but if you want a more \\"complete one\\" with many deep cut favorites, the 2007 collection simply titled \\"The Police\\" is the better option..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sooooooo fun I am a boy and I love this game I think it is fun for all boys and girls
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Well you get a Bruno Mars digital album. There is only one popular song, and most other Bruno Mars songs sound similar. Some decent stuff but nothing fantastic.<br /><br />Mostly love themed. Probably could put four stars but I'm grumpy. If you like collecting music or Bruno mars its a good deal for $4.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is hard to earn points now I can only get up to 20000<br />please fix this and make it not go as fast when u get up to 20000 to 30000.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  The three different perspectives made this book unique and incredible.  Each chapter pulled you in even more.  It was great seeing everything tie in as each perspective made sense of the others.  I absolutely loved it!
B00136JS12|2.0|I'm not reviewing the music, we know it's one of the great rock classics.  My review is the mp3 album download.  The quality is terrible.  I know, mp3 is not great quality to begin with.  But the sound is deadened and lifeless.  Maybe recording equipment is better today, there are many fine quality mp3 out there.  This great masterpiece, which I enjoyed during my youth on vinyl, does not seem to translate to digital medium. I'm really bummed!
055357342X|5.0|This is a story you never want to end! Just as awesome as the previous books, the suspense never dies down.

075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book. He has tons of Ninjago books, but this one is the one he uses to draw by! Excellent choice~!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game runs smoothly. Graphics and options are great. I especially appreciate the way the ads run. Always a simple and clean rhythm. There's no mystery as to how to skip or close the ad. Just click the word 'skip' or the X and it takes me right back to the game. Other game developers need to take a lesson from these developers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game Is Amazing I Would Recommend This Endless Runner To Every Person I Know. Clearly Better Than Temple Run And Temple Run 2.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Absolutely AMAZING book!  I had the hardest time putting it down to go to bed.  Every part is excellent and never boring.  Get this book!  5 stars(I would give it 7 if I could).

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|this is a very strange album. It starts off with a traditional song with take a walk but everything from that point on gets crazy for the better. Passion Pit is very interesting but they are even better live.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I got this as a gift for Christmas and have only had little trouble with it.Small things such as if I unplugged the USB sound would stop thorugh the computers internal mic. Well after months of use and figuring things out I came home today and unplugged the usb to play a song for someone. The chip that has the USB head that goes into the casing where all the chip work is CAME OUT of the case. It took me 3 hours and a bunch of painters tape in order to get the piece working again. Not only do i have to tape the casing shut but i have to tape it up in a certain position in order to make it work
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My rating: 5 of 5<br /><br />After getting disappointed by my trip down memory lane and re-reading the second Piers Anthony book in the Incarnations of Immortality series I was a little disheartened. What was I to read?<br /><br />I did what I usually do - and looked around the internet, talked to friends, and finally got a good recommendation from my older brother. He suggested I take a look at the new series by Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />Let's start with a simple statement. It was a great book.<br /><br />Now let's dig in a little.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is clearly a very talented and imaginative writer. He brings his world to life, and pulls you into it in the process. The characters are well built and you can't help but get emotionally invested in Kvothe's story.<br /><br />That's the good stuff.<br /><br />Now for the bit that drove me nearly mad. The book starts out in the \\"today\\" and opens with a bit of action and an unknown threat that is just barely fleshed out. Then it dives into a story within the story, as Kvothe tells Chronicler the tale of his life. This accounts for 95% of the book, and begins when Kvothe is nothing but a twelve year old boy. It drags you in, it makes you want to know who Kvothe is, and in the process, drove me nuts.<br /><br />Not because its not well done, and not because it is boring. But rather the fact that there is no conclusion, no middle or end. It feels like the whole book is the beginning. And even though it was a good length - it still ended too soon.<br /><br />We don't know what's really going on in the \\"today\\" timeline other than that Kvothe is depressed and maybe lost most of his magic. And in the story of his life we don't know how he got kicked out of the Acarnum, or what happened with him and Denna. Or how he and Bast, the fae, came to be friends (or student and teacher to be exact).<br /><br />There are too many open threads, and I want MORE!!!!<br /><br />The second book better have some small conclusions init or I'll be ripping my hair out.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I love futuristic sci-fi movies and found this one breath-holding, sit on the edge of your seat spell binding.  Actually was afraid of nightmares afterwards!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Easy listening and very relaxing music . This is my first jazz CD I buy and I am glad to have it.
B006U9IY76|5.0|Love this little one too. The only thing with her is that it feels like her face is on backwards, meaning all the other trains the &#34;face&#34; has some engine in front.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel is stellar as usual. The movie dragged in spots and seemed a little longer than it needed to be.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I luv the game but every time i go to the subway surfer home screen an ad pops up!! So annoying! If there werent an ad problem it would be 5 stars! :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|What can I say?  It's another great Vince Flynn book about the clandestine life of Mitch Rapp and taking out assbag terrorist.  Always look forward to the next one coming out.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This was an episode where I literally held my breath...all the characters you grow to care about throughout the show are in jeopardy and you feel so afraid for them. It's an amazing feat for a show to make you feel so much love for characters.
B003ZSI9YI|5.0|This album is so good. I love Phil Collins and he has truly shown his talent once again with this release.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|When I ordered this from Amazon (prompt, perfect delivery, as usual) it was based strictly on a powerful recommendation from a friend I trust, not my favorite way to buy movies. In this instance, I'm so glad I did. Will it scare you? I think it will; scared the daylights out of me. But somehow, it's so hard to simply categorize this as a horror film. It has so much more to give. All the principal performances are terrific, and it helps that all of them get such juicy parts to play in this courtroom drama of a priest charged with the death of a young Catholic girl after an exorcism. All points of view are represented, and you're going to walk away from this one thinking, deeply. It's the film Agnes of God should have been and wasn't. Haven't had a chance yet to screen the bonus disk, which I assume discusses the real case upon which the movie was based. Not sure I want to. The spiritual questions brought forth in this powerful film don't, I think, hinge on the degree to which it stuck to the facts of a case. It's just too good for that on its own. Beautiful, scary, intelligent and deeply spiritual.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Great dramatic recreation of this historical event. The acting was good but a little stilted. Subject matter more suited for a documentary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a fabulous series! I have been hooked since the first episode of the first series! A friend of mine described it best...British crack. Once you start watching it, you cant stop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have. I would recommend getting it. The best part is is that its free. You have yo update it every once in awhile so it changes the world tour place. I love this game it's so much fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 lived up to season 1.  Still and awesome show that is hard to resist.  My wife and I love watching it together, we just wish it was not so addictive.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Was honestly one of the best books I've ever read hope the movie is just as good. This book takes you on his adventures the written in the format of  letters.
B00204AA0O|5.0|This is the second Regina Spektor album that I purchased. Listening to this album always puts me in a good mood so I listen to this album regularly from beginning to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and love it. I think this is a good game for kids to learn how to jump over things like my brother for instance he will jump over anything in the world.I'm completely serious.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Almost clicked the order button, but due to my love of the extended versions of the original trilogy, I decided to do a little research before I made that mistake.  in doing so, I discovered that the Blue-Ray/DVD set for release on March 19th will contain only the theatrical version of the movie.  Warner Bros is including a teaser trailer containing Dragon Smaug with this version in order to entice people to buy it.  The extended version of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' will be released in time for Christmas 2013.  As with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Warner Bros. is trying to stick it to the consumer again by hoping people will buy both versions.  Sorry, WB... I can wait another nine months.  In the meantime, I'll rent a copy to satisfy my urge to see it sooner.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|CAUTION, ADDICTIVE - Don't watch this unless you are ready to commit to the 100 episodes of the entire series!
B005T87QCI|5.0|this is a great game just for. 99 cents so buy it today and now it has cheap dlcs witch is downloadable content Wichita is awsome
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a rule, I am not a fan of sci-fi, and especially not dystopian novels. This one sucked me in and kept me riveted. Excellent characters, unpredictable plot twists, and highly original story make this one I would recommend to anyone.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well done, kept us on the edge of our seats. We were prompted by the Grammys to give it a try and we were not disappointed!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale of two people who find an unusual connection through a personal's ad. Without giving away the ending (which was perhaps a bit contrived), I will say that I found the characters to be humorous, utterly believable, and terribly poignant. The author manages to convey two very different points of view, and to intertwine the present lives and the histories of these characters in a way that left me wanting to read more of her work. Some great moments of slapstick comedy (I can easily see this done as a movie!), as well as heart-breaking sadness. Lovely read.
B0013D6LEM|4.0|Got it at great price, still one of the 'classics' and obviously will<br />always be enjoyed, timeless!  Add to any collection.
B008476HBM|5.0|When I need comfort, I turn to Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my personal heroes, and Darcy is an excellent match for her.<br />The first time I read it--when I was 17--I was keenly aware of the brilliant comedy in the book. As I re-read it again and again over the years, it still makes me laugh, but it also makes me think of Jane Austen herself, and how a woman whose life was so circumscribed by her circumstances could manage to create such an astonishing array of characters, with such depth.<br />Don't miss it. And for goodness sake, DON'T CALL IT A ROMANCE! It's a comedy of manners.
B004SBULWE|3.0|After a successful install this app is not as effective as it was on my Droid phone.  But it is still useful.  Do not allow it to be to aggressive in shutting down other apps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome. I just got it today and I love it! I love house and this game is teaching me a lot
B004LQJOY2|5.0|I watched this film for an essay in my film and politics class. I really liked it. I chose it primarily because I was familiar with the quiz show scandals, but the film really brought history alive. Robert Redford put many different messages in the film such as: corporate greed, ethics, and racial stereotypes. Redford said that there is an eternal struggle between greed and ethics. It was definitely a good film. I recommend it for anyone (even those not watching it for an essay!).
B007L5GDGW|5.0|It needs a little more handling on moving the ball,but I love it.  It's awesome! Who Wouldn't like this game
B007MU85D0|5.0|I had only heard &#34;Little Talks&#34; when I decided to buy the whole album. I was not disappointed. Their voices and sound mesh so well together. If this is what Icelandic music is like, keep it coming.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is the story of a man whose skill and love of flying made him an outstanding fighter pilot, but more than that, he possed surprising compassion toward his countrymen, chivalry toward his enemies and a dislike (even hatred) of the Nazis.  It is this man's humanity, along with his successes under difficult and dangerous circumstances and the ever present danger of being arrested by the Nazis that make this a compelling human interest story,.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|The whole CD is really good. There is a good reason why their music is starting to be featured a lot more, because it is a really great album.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I originally got this because my son hates tummy time, and loves mirrors.<br />And it definitely helped! He gets so distracted by the lights and sounds and mirror that he doesn't even realize he's flipped and rolled over trying to grab at it.<br />So helpful and serves its purpose, bigger kids seem to love it too so I'm sure we'll be holding onto it for a while, great buy!<br />-Mom of 7mo old boy
B007M45PMU|3.0|I bought this after hearing Ho Hey. In my head their sound was indie rock so I bought the whole CD. I didn't really like it after realizing it was a lot more indie. Lots of my friends really like it, but it's not for me.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|It was a cartoon love story but a typical Adam Sandler film. It was cute for me as an adult but the kids watched it twice in the 24 rental time we had it for.
034580404X|1.0|I got suckered into book #1 by all the hype and by the end of the first chapter I knew I had thoroughly wasted my money. Took me 3 weeks to get through the book. This shallow, immature woman has no writing talent whatsoever! I heard that the 3rd book was \\"by far the best of the three\\" so I borrowed it from a friend, skipping book #2. I never finished book #3. It stunk as bad as the 1st book.<br /><br />But, this lamebrain no-talent wannabe writer got rich off this trilogy. What a joke.
B00BHMF578|1.0|This happened before. I'm not sure how to get my money but its a pain.<br /><br />I don't using amazon for movies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot. The ending could have been a bit stronger, overall it was a good read.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read several of his books and have enjoyed each one.  They are always well written and have good plots.
B00846REIS|4.0|Sexy, mesmerizing, couldn't put it down! Looking forward to the next book. Need to see the next event for Eva and Gideon.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Works great with my Nikon, worth every penny.  I bought this instead of those huge flashes that are on stands.  My wife loves it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love the full screen calculator. Always works when I need it...no bugs. Even my four year old likes to play with it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher at his best!  An entertaining read, continuing the Reacher legacy in grand style. Can't wait for the next installment.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is a classic...however:  even though this is the UK version, it does not have all the scenes that were shown on my pbs station.  One particular episode on the dvd was 2 minutes shorter than when it aired on tv.  The missing scenes do not change the storyline, I just find it enjoyable to watch every bit of Downton that I can.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|GREAT.....2ND SEASON BETTER THAN 1ST... AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE FIRST SEASON.  JESSICA LANGE DESERVES AN EMMY .  VERY CREEPY SHOW...
B0053FANS6|5.0|I really enjoyed these movies. They are made in the same vein as &#34;Indiana Jones,&#34; films. They are full of action and CGI. It is like they got a new box of crayons and went nuts with them. Not to be taken in a serious way but, enjoyed as action movies with little to worry about. I am not sure why they change the actress playing the lead in the third film. I didn't like the new one as well. But, other than that I have no complaints. Nice escapist fare.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I enjoyed Chris Kyle's book, but I wish he would have gone into more detail about the logistics of being a sniper.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I started the book one night and couldn't put it down. I think everyone can relate to the characters in the book which is why it is such a great read. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I can't wait to watch the movie now!
B000HZED8S|2.0|Just couldn't get past the unrealistic presentation of the plot. Presented as a modern movie with an old science fiction plot in a post-modern setting that really isn't!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Great movie.  Love the songs in it.  Every little girl needs this movie, and it's perfect for family movie nights.
0316069434|4.0|On the cusp of retirement - yet again - Harry Bosch has been assigned to the cold case unit. This time, the team is trying to solve cases that occurred during the bedlam of the LA/Rodney King riots two decades ago. One of the unsolved murders that he's never forgotten is that of an attractive Danish journalist, Anneke Jesperson, who was shot at point blank range in dark alley. His superiors don't want him to reopen that one for racial and political reasons - Anneke (dubbed \\"Snow White\\" by some of the cops) was the single white death among a sea of African American ones, and they don't want to create the impression that her case is being given preferential treatment. But, Harry being Harry, he grabs onto it like a German shepherd with a soup bone, starting from square one using techie tools that were never available at the time.<br /><br />As a police procedural, The Black Box is engrossing. For readers who have followed Harry's exploits through seventeen previous novels, what is equally interesting is learning where he is personally, through his relationships with his teenaged daughter and the woman in his life, and ethically, now that he's lived long enough to exert some control over that impulsiveness that always lands him in hot water. He's a man whose credo is \\"Everybody counts or nobody counts\\", which is what makes him such a good detective. But he's sick of the injustice that pervades the system, and is mightily tempted to take justice into his own hands. The author is a master at putting us inside Harry's head, and that's what makes these books worthwhile.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Bought this for my kids for Christmas, along with Toy Story and Toy Story 3.  We love all of them.  Great for family movie nights!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|very very good. scary to the core, a look inside the mental health approach that was commonplace as recently as the 50's all over the world.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Bought this for my kids for Christmas, along with Toy Story and Toy Story 3.  We love all of them.  Great for family movie nights!
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is great but it asks post on Facebook ,twitter ,like, etc..Other than that its great blah blah blah extra words
0920668364|5.0|This book has always been one of my favorites and I've always been really touched by the story. Yes it's kind of unlikely that the mother takes a ladder across town and does a B&E into her son's window- BUT I still find this to be a really beautiful story especially now that I have my own little boy. And actually I probably wouldn't have any qualms about breaking into my sons house (if he weren't still a baby). If you can suspend your disbelief over that one part and take the whole story for what it is-a story of a mother's love- then I think you could find it very meaningful. I especially love to tell my son the phrase that the mother in the book repeats to her son &#34;I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be&#34;.
B00BLGZDYA|1.0|This movie makes no sense at all.  Nothing comes together and it is incomprehensible.  How did this ever get to the theaters.  Don't be fooled, a five year old could write and film a much more creative and through provoking movie.  Please do not waste your time and make the same mistake we did.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I spend a lot of time each Christmas looking for the most difficult puzzles I can possibly find for my husband. He is very good at puzzles and can usually figure them out in no time which is no fun. A rubicks cube is nothing to him! I bought this for him and was pleasantly surprised that it took him so long to complete. He spent a lot of time playing with this and kept coming back for more. I could tell it was really challenging for him, which was a win in my book!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I chose a 3 because it is a dictionary!!! I didn't really read it. I just used it for words I didn't know in some of my books.
B001PPGAK8|5.0|My 7 year old loved this movie. I found it a bit more violent than other X-men movies but still enjoyed it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|very interesting and fairly easy to play. loved the story line! lots of hidden object scenes. worked good on my kindle. you can use hints if you get lost!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The process was convoluted for me. I am not an expert but not a total novice either. Downloaded and install numerous programs on computers and tab. But this eluded me. Tried to follow instruction several times to no avail. Not sure what the problem is. So I gave it a 1 star
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book was a big eye opener. While I am not obese I struggle with 10 pounds and can never get to my ideal weight. The concepts laid out in this book make me realize why. I already implemented them and am seeing success.<br /><br />The book is well written and a great read. Thanks Gary for putting it out there.
1932100385|5.0|This book is a life changing experience. Because of what I learned from The China Study,  I've changed my diet completely. The authors write in detail the scientific studies on how nutrition and several diseases are directly related.<br />They also write about how the powerful food and drug industry do not want this information to get out. Reads like a novel but unfortunately is true.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple but useful the numbers are large and easy to read. Great for simple math help its a good app to have.
B00181JGI2|5.0|One of my top favorites.  Any Coen brothers fan will enjoy this movie.  Lots of good one-liners and memorable scenes.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love this app. I can listen to whatever I fancy. From Classical to Rock and everything in between. You can go to any country and discover new and innovative music. I listen to soul music from outside the USA.  I now like Bluegrass.  I listen to my favorite jazz musicians. You can even record and play your favorites.<br /><br />This is definity worth the spin.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book. The book kept me interested from start to finish. If you like war storys this is an exceptional read.
B00633W614|5.0|This book was very good,and hard to put down,it was as good as I  though it would be,am looking forward to the next book.
0786915749|5.0|At first glance, this initial entry in Weis and Hickman's trilogy appears to be standard fantasy fare - a band of adventurers must unite to save the world from imminent doom. The basic plot does follow this structure, and there are times when timely rescues and magical boons appear to be invocations of deus ex machina rather than a result of the natural flow of events.<br /><br />But look just beneath, and it becomes clear that there is far more grim doom and despair than the seeming ease with which the companions overcome their hurdles would suggest. The frailty of mortal beings is set out on display for all to see. As just one example, the notion that people would rather believe a convenient untruth that warms their soul and gives them comfort than search out for correct answers or face a tsunami of brutal reality rears its ugly head shortly after the novel's halfway point.<br /><br />Descriptions of imaginary creatures and spells is always kept brisk and trenchant, preventing boredom due to rambling from setting in. Re-reading this was a most welcome change from Terry Goodkind's plagiarised and inordinately lethargically paced 800-page debut novel, Wizard's First Rule.<br /><br />The characters shine throughout the book, and rather than rush headlong into action and resolutions without giving readers a foundation to care about the wanderers and their epic trek, we are given glimpses into their past (particularly what they did in the five-year leadup to the reunion that serves as the trilogy's catalyst). There's Tasslehoff, a perennial nomad and pioneer, utterly impervious to fear (and good sense), glib and fun to have around - to a point. Twins Raistlin and Caramon led separate lives and arrived at polar opposite professions, a mage and warrior respectively. Plainsman Riverwind and Chieftain's daughter Goldmoon find themselves acquainted with the group after a combination of coincidence and superstition-motivated prejudice and tragedy strike. Tanis half-elven and Flint the dwarf are the wise custodians who raised the bulk of their company, and their loyalty will be tested and strained to breaking point. After all, the spectre of war is ever-present, and there is no surer way to guarantee one's own survival than by turning traitor.<br /><br />The authors do an impeccable job of imagining life as other races, and sweep readers along for a thrilling (though perilous and at times gruesome) journey through a conflict that spans and transcends time, space and superstition. Highly recommended.Flint the dwarf are the wise custodians who raised the bulk of their company, and their loyalty will be tested and strained to breaking point.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|After running through a number of backpacks during my college career, I finally decided to fork out the money for a real one.  The quality is great, and as someone with back/neck problems I found the weight distribution to be phenomenal.  My college campus was several miles across and class schedules literally had to take physical fitness into account to insure prompt arrival.  That being said, this backpack got me through 2 years of these hikes (roughly 5 miles or so a day) with over 50 lbs of materials (books, laptop, etc).  The straps frayed to the point of concern, a zipper came undone and finally a plastic clasp broke.  Other backpacks I had literally split open like an Alien had burst out of them.  I can't really fault SwissGear for a 'shoddy product' when it held up so well comparably.<br /><br />What I did originally was to purchase this at BestBuy for a mark-up price.  Because the backpack was initially purchased at BestBuy, they are willing to exchange the product in-store under manufacturer's warranty (which I believe is the life of the product).  In my case, I returned the backpack and got store credit which I put toward another purchase.  Buying my second of these on Amazon, which they told me could be returned in-store at BestBuy because they honor manufacturer's warranties.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this backpack.

B00005A3KS|5.0|Next to &#34;Speed&#34; this movie had enough star power and cameos to make it one of Keanu Reeves' best films and Swayze made it work better.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Best read I have read in years after my own mother's death. I felt like I was walking the trail.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Woody Harrelson's range as an actor is shown in this post apocolyptic zombie movie that has alot of really disgusting moments but really hits the mark.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|The combination of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson is better than any adaptation of the famous detective ever made.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Ordered this App for my Kindle. I have been using this for about 3 months . This APP is a must have for any Kindle.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Many people have long disputed the &#34;narrated&#34; version of Bladerunner but in my opinion it is the Best Version and the only one that adds life to the movie.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Once again pairing up Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as the wise cracking sleuths this movie proves Guy Ritchies staying power.
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena was very entertaining to me, and I loved every minute I read. I love the conflicts that occur which had made the plot more complicated. The detail made this book come to life, and I felt like I was one of the characters. Rick Riordan did very well on the characterization to bring the characters out. All in all, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys Greek and Roman mythology, and to those who enjoy action, fantasy, and just the right amount of complicated romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing and addictive because anytime I see it on my kindle fire I just have to play it, but there is one doubt it is just copying temple run. Anyway if you were looking to buy this game then go ahead  don't let me stop you from your actions it is an amazing game. (suitable for all ages and great fun for the little ones)
B001H9MYPW|5.0|The best series that has ever aired on TV! People who want to understand what therapy is all about should watch this series. The therapy process is illustrated in an exciting manner. Both the strengths and weakness of therapy become evident to the viewer. Gabriel Byrne is an accomplished actor and so are the rest of the cast. The characters are portrayed so well it is difficult to view them as fictional. My only regret is that the series has ended. Watch out...this compelling series is strongly addictive!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Intense and powerful movie. This movie deserved all of the recognition it has received.<br />we really enjoyed this movie. Thank You Ben Affleck.
1423140605|5.0|The secondary series of Percy Jackson is so much better than the first and The Mark of Athena is no exception. Warning: Huge cliffhanger ending!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This App has really helped me out. Sadly Youtube accessed off of silk doesn't work well at all, but tubeMate is the answer to that problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like temple run.You try to avoid obstacles in a subway and you have to switch lanes sometimes.I think it is really cool.Some of the characters are dumb though like Yutani(alien)and Frank(weird business dude with bunny mask on)but other than thatI love this game.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Well, it's a nice app to have. I just find myself not using it that much because my cell phone is a lot quicker to access the weather with.
0525478817|4.0|It is not my favorite book by john Green, but i was very touched by the story of those characters.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Well, I liked it, when I used Facebook, then I deactivated my account, so I don't really use it that much anymore.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is simply unbeatable!!  We watch this over and over and over again!  It should be required viewing!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks is my favorite author, and this one held surprises that kept me from putting it down until I reached the end.
0312330537|5.0|This is one of  my favorite books of all time....I recommend it to everyone!  Over 900 pages and you STILL don't want it to end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I have more fun playing this version than the original. Super addictive with great graphics and sound.

B0011Z77OK|5.0|a career spanning collection of hits. this would make a great introduction for someone who is not familiar with the work of RHCP.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|Decent overview but not for beginners.  If you don't already have a pretty good notion of what is in HTML5 you may not be much more enlightened by this little book.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app I ever had!This is a must get for Temple run fans or people who like adventure.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Saw the video and had to hear he rest of the album, an excellent choice if you like music that ins't about bumpin and grindin and drinkin.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's great to read about youth that have great parents.  I miss this often in real life.  Sad but true.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A little sad, but different from the usual fiction. if you like MAeve Binchy, you'll like this book. Has some humor in it as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games is a great book, if u like adventure and action, then you should read this book, because i loved it and i know you will to!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Its about time someone is actually singing about something meaningful again. Great band as well.Definitely something to relax to and listen to on those long drives.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|Expanding on the instrumentation used on his last solo release, the jazz influence continues its presence here.  But this is not a jazz album!  Mr. Wilson's writing continues to mature and grow and the results are very impressive again here.  There are moments of sheer brilliance-The Watchmaker stands out.  The lead guitarist on this one is very strong, but I confess to wishing Steven handled those parts as well.  The recording is excellent, which is of course no surprise.  And how great is it to see Steve Hackett's name in the credits?  A close listen to some of the acoustic guitars will find sounds reminiscent of Steve's recordings from the 70's-perhaps their recent collaborations influenced Mr. Wilson to purchase a guitar or two?  The deluxe DVD version of this album includes a tremendous little gem of a surprise-the DVD was authored by the great Ray Schulman, multi-instrumentalist bass player of the very best progressive rock band of the 1970's, the legendary Gentle Giant.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story continues smoothly...as if there were no break. . The csst does an excellent job of protraying the characters and how things were in the time depicted.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started a little late, but now I'm a big fan! I'm obsessed with the show. I'm still catching up in the middle of season 2.
1423136802|5.0|I haven't read this myself, but the thank-you note I received indicated that my grandson was enjoying these, and he doesn't choose to read very often.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is what the average person is really looking for. It looks and responds just like a pocket<br />calculator. This what I call a user friendly app.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Best e-mail service that ever was!  Held my account open and all my information for almost 2 years I was offline.  I use Yahoo for homepage and search as well as instant message.  I can't think of any negatives at all!
B005LAII8K|4.0|Intelligent sci-fi is a relatively rare beast these days, so it’s gratifying to see someone trying – even when it arguably doesn’t work on every level.  In the case of this movie, we have time travel as the maguffin. Criminal organisations of the future now have access to time travel, and use it to dispose of people they want rid of, sending them back to ‘loopers’ - assassins who are paid by the bars of silver attached to the victims.  This arrangement is lucrative for the loopers, but has one drawback – one day they will be asked to ‘close the loop’, when their own future self is sent back for disposal, so that no future police force can identify who is breaking the law outlawing time travel.<br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the key performer here, more so than Willis – though it’s always absurdly satisfying to see our Bruce pick up a machine gun and start wrecking the place..  Willis is Levitt’s future self, but when sent back to be killed by his younger self things don’t go according to plan, and they both end up on the run, with both converging on the farmhouse of Emily Blunt and her son. At least, that’s where things kick off.. this set up is just a starting point for an intriguing set up to an unexpected showdown.  Emily Blunt is excellent, and her son played by Pierce Gagnon defies expectation of child actors to play his own unique character believably.<br />Plaudits to the script then that makes things interesting while avoiding getting too wrapped up in the paradoxes and logic issues with time travel.  Thinking hard about it afterwards will likely only give you a headache as the logic starts to unravel, but in the moment it’s a satisfying and thoughtful, while still action packed movie.<br />All in all, a decent cast with some good ideas combined with action create an entertaining and brain engaging couple of hours.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is a must read novel. Once you start reading it is very hard to put the novel down!<br /> The plot of the story is fairly simple and easy to follow. However, there are some twists and turns to keep you guessing. The novel is based around the murder of Ben Rafkin. Ben was a high school student in the small town of Newton, Connecticut. Newton was a quiet town and Andy Barber was the DA. It just so happens that Andy's son Jacob was in the the same class at school as the murder victim Ben.<br /><br /> Jacob is blamed for killing Ben. There are many pieces of evidence that indicate Jacob is guilty. Before his case can go to trial Andy is released from his position as DA. Andy makes it his mission to prove his son's innocence. The novel shows the struggles the family must go through as they await and then go through the trial. Over the course of Andy defending Jacob several deep dark secrets are revealed. Andy and his wife, Laurie learn that Jacob may have a dark past along with other secrets they never knew about. An important aspect of the novel no matter what happens life must go on. Life after the trial is just as interesting as life before and during the trial for the Barber family.<br /><br /> The novel brings several factors into play all at one time. It does a wonderful job of showing the love parents have for their children and how this love can sometimes be blind. The effects a trial can have a on family and a small town. There are many twists and turns, just when you think you have everything figured out a twist is thrown in. Even after reading the final page your still left wondering and speechless!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|They still sound great.  Too bad they will not tour.  We saw Robert Plant in Birmingham, August 2012 and wish it had been like Celebration Day.  Great album!
B0050OMJIW|5.0|left wing expression, but not bound by such sensibilities .. marvellous, funny, fantastic .. anecdotes which crescendo in a tour de force
B00A81NFAS|4.0|A true sense of mimicry in every aspect. Any film aficionado understands that both art and life reflect on both canvas and film. David O'Russell captures true life within each frame and allows you to feel good about it. He ask the viewer to understand that there is a method to his madness and in the art of philosophy answers the question, \\"If a sane man were in an insane world would he be considered insane?\\" In \\"Silver Lining Playbook\\" we find our character, Pat Solitano trying his best to hold on to his sanity and sense of optimism while constantly being bombarded by the downtrodden failures of those who surround him. Suffering from his own disappointments we began to understand why and what it was that had driven him to the brink of madness.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper's performance once again proves his worth as he looses himself within the script of \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\", giving the audience an in your face point of view as Pat Solitano while allowing the cast of this well articulated masterpiece to compliment each other was pure perfection. Seeing Pat Sr. played by Robert De Niro enforced the idea that while family can be a burden they can also be a blessing and in my opinion both Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro's performances were deserving of an Oscar. Even the young Jennifer Lawrence brought magic to the screen as she played our heroine, \\"Tiffany\\". Reaching out to what seems to be a hopeless cause our two characters begin to understand not everything is the way we would have it. However with a little bit of sweat, hard work and determination we can find what we need when we need it and enjoy those all to few moments in which bliss allows us a chance to overcome.<br /><br />\\"Silver Lining Playbook\\" receives a **** and a half star rating for all of the constellations lining up just right. Anyway, Take care and enjoy, Joshua C.<br /><br />If you liked this film you should check out:<br /> Beast of the Southern Wild ****<br /> The Life of Pi ****<br /> Limitless****<br /> The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons****<br /> The Odd Life of Timothy Greene****<br /> Forrest Gump****<br /> Powder***
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really could not put it down!!! If I didn't have 3 kids, I would have read it straight thru....instead, it took me two days!! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is way to addictive and thats awesome. I love this game. You should add more courses instead of the  same thing each time.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|this is a grate knife for half the price! Sturdy and robust! If you want a back contrary survival knife holds up with all the others that are twice as much...
B009EEFTMC|5.0|FUN BUT ADDICTIVE. VERY GOOD FOR ELDERS TO KEEP MIND AND FINGERS WORKING BETTER. PLAYED WHILE RIDING ON HIGHWAY AT NIGHT TO PASS TIME
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|it help keep you mind alart i like it it is fuh to play cut the rope experiment zopto lab
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. I like doing the missions. Its a great time waster. I recommend this game to anyone.
B00004YRQA|4.0|What is there to say? It's a memory card. It's worked fine for me since I bought it, and that's all I can really ask of it.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|I have the free app and love it. When thisthen this one became the free app of the day, I was excited. But it won't let me download.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|A good balance of the sleuthing from the first film as well as action...I think it's a little lacking as far as character development but for the franchise it's still a good movie.  Would recommend....
B009EEFTMC|5.0|So it's kinda like the game Memory in that you have to find two of each thing with the added functionality of being in a 3D world having to rotate the 'cube' to find more pairs to eliminate.  It's basic in that there's not much challenge other than beating your time but then there's attack mode where over time more sets keep popping up and the only way is to try to quickly empty all the pairs.  The attack mode is too frustrating for me so I only play the basic mode.  Either way, great time killer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is a must have. The only downside to it is that my husband is constantly borrowing my Kindle to use this app! Well worth the download!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Would NOT recommend - Loved book- film too self indulgent and artsy! - more like watching an avant garde play than movie. Only + was the cinematography - beautifully shot colors/scenes/ costumes.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I finished this book in just two days, giving up sleep, some food<br />and a bunch of housework to finish it.  Why?  Because I couldn't<br />put it down for long!  Loved this book. It was full of suspense<br />and had me wondering what would happen next, at every turn.  The<br />ending was also a big surprise, but I won't ruin it for others by<br />saying what it was! What an imagination this writer has, and what<br />talent!
B009FZFONO|5.0|My wife ( who hates zombie movies ) watched te first episode and got hooked! She showed me and in one weekend we watched both season 1 and 2! Now we had to get season 3 and I love that even if my dvr doesn't record my amazon will have it for me the next day!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I like my horse because unlike other gem games you do not spend actual money.  You play for gems and coins, you can get more gems by doing things like downloading the priceline app and you can get more coins by using gems.<br /><br />Had to drop four stars off my review, because one day as I was playing, it converted me to level one and they made it so hard to contact them, that I gave up on the game altogether.  Plus they owed me 60 gems puls the 130 gems I lost after the game broke. Fun game when it actually works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is just a temple run copy but it is still very fun fun fun! Temple run is still better
B0000041ZT|5.0|I purchased this CD because I performed the 2nd Jazz Suite with an area orchestra.  The other two pieces are equally fun to listen to.  The tempos on this recording feel good and not rushed like the Russian recording I originally found to listen to.  (One of the movements was so fast that you could hear the orchestra slow down so the xylo player could play the part!)  This CD is very good. Good solid entertainment with pieces that aren't performed too often.  A delight to listen to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it.  So intense and almost makes you feel like you are part of the story.  Loved every bit of it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I could read Pride and Prejudice again and again and still enjoy every page. A true classic to be enjoyed
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Great movie! Very funny and visually cool looking. John c Reilly did a great job with Ralph's voice !! All of the characters were well done too
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Another favorite holiday movie to watch year after year. We have our favorite 'must  sees' every year at Christmas and this is one. It's an anniversary edition so it has some great stuff in it, the B&W, the colorized and more.
034580404X|5.0|Books are great. They all come in one pack.  Awesome it's a must read. Goes beyond expectation. Nothing more to say.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am sitting here as the end of the book comes wanting more! I will read more books by this author if they are as compelling and as difficult to put down as the story of Amy and Nick.  I can see why it spent so much time on the best-selling book list.  You just have to read this book if you enjoy diabolical women!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish that I could play everyday .  So edifting everythirng is so fun love charecter s and the eggs are so much fun to get.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I'm a complete Homeland fanatic. I can't wait for season 2 to come out so I can get it. I highly recommend it.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|On the kindle fire, it takes forever to get the updates that other players already have.. And I dislike how they changed the zooming. Before you could zoom out really far,  but now you cant. Which is stupid.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|Kids love it, they make beautiful pictures. Wish I could send and print. Keeps them busy and it's better than some of the other stuff they play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't consumed a series this quickly since I don't know when. Towards the end I found myself distraught to put down this series and would actually be in suspense of what was to happen next throughout the day until I could read it again. Very entertaining and thought provoking in terms of what our Legacy is to be.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|Needs settings so you can learn game in a user friendly fashion. Will be uninstalling as it is to frustrating.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Considering that I read this during my first pregnancy, I can say that this is the most useful parenting book I came across.  Instead of indulging in American-style neurosis, this book helped me to sit back and enjoy being pregnant (and excited for the new, rational being who was about to enter my life).  If you want to be a cool, calm, and collected parent, then this book is a must-read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been jam packed with action. There have been many unexpected losses. The writers are keeping the fans guessing and interested. This show is unlike any other show on television. It is addicting and leaves you wanting more. Action, gore, love and betrayal, what more could one ask for?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game it  travels around the world .Subway Surfers app is very creative and good fun for all the family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Temple Run for kids.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A host of complex characters kept me tied to this book.  The issue of how best to deal with disadvantaged young people as well as the difficulty of communicating in a meaningful way in &#34;normal&#34; families is presented in the compelling format of small town competition and politics. The reader is left to sift through all the different behaviors of the characters from courageous and caring to hateful, spiteful, and vindictive.  The last chapter left me more hopeful about the human race.
B000000XBC|5.0|This old school music was just what I needed to inspire me to crack open that beer and not do much of anything for the afternoon. Lets face it, if you don't like CCR then you don't like AMERICA!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I do not go to many movies, but this marvelous book has created a drive in me to see this on screen, if only to check that image against the clear images in my mind during and after reading.  Martel has the ability to create near-holographic images in this book. I could see, smell and feel many of the things he described; his spiritual experiences would normally have turned me off, but they seemed to enhance the total experience. A way to know the universe.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Wow, this tv series on sci-fi is amazing! Love it, love it, love it! I ordered the third season on \\"instant video\\" because I was so anxious to continue watching it and couldn't wait but I will be sure to purchase all complete seasons on dvd. And I hope that there are many seasons to come. Excellent story plots, fantastic performance from cast, and amazing effects in addition to the scenery...Haven is a beautiful place even if these supernatural events keep happening...the panorama for all the scenes is breathtaking!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My granddaughters and I call this the Pretty Game.  It is addictive and relaxing.  What does the movie camera Icon do at the bottom of the screen?  It seems to straighten the cube but sometimes it moves to another face of it?  Love the app!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This game is amazing!I love it! The babies are adorable! The game is addicting! I am on level 40. The only thing I hate is when the animals run away. Other than that little thing this game is the best in the world.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of Thrones is a nicely done adaptation from the books.  It pretty closely follows the original story, and the production value is outstanding.  Easily one of the best miniseries in existence.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just what I was looking for!!! My favorite feature of the alarm clock app is the misic you can set as your wake up tune, it makes getting up at 5:00AM a little better.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|Saw this in theater as lead to believe it would be this super James Bond type kid with revenge as her goal. Well, sat through movie but not sure why. A great big bust as very little \\"James Bond\\" action figure action. Wanted to like it but in the end, nothing here. What could have been....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a very interesting book my favorite part was when they where on the island. If you have not read this book you should. It is my favorite book!
B000JIJPZY|4.0|I saw this at walmart for more than it was on amazon, the toys can be moved around and it comes with an adorable little pillow for the baby's head. My daughter threw up the first day we used it but it was easy to clean and wash and still looks new. I love this play mat.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever on SyFy.  Too bad its the last season.  I feel like they are rushing the story line to finish up before the end of the show (Season 5).
B001IF252C|5.0|Bought this adapter to use w/ my mac mini & Crossover 27Q monitor. My hope was this adapter had firmware v1.03 so that I could avoid a trip to the apple store. Lucky, firmware was fine. I have experienced no problems and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />A special thanks to seller (bumblexd) for prompt shipping. Although estimated delivery date was between March 4th & 19th, I received item on March 1st.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app but It was hard to find where the update<br />to get the Rome update. The Rio version was so fun.
1401324649|2.0|This book started charmingly enough with a centenarian, Allen Karlsson, who escapes his birthday celebration at the geriatric home and stumbles on an amazing journey that involved some hapless gangsters, a fraudster, a hot-dog seller with more than a few &#34;almost-university&#34; degrees under his belt, an expletive-spewing redhead, her Alsatian, an domesticated elephant, and an innocuous-looking grey suitcase that becomes the central focus of everyone.<br /><br />With such an amusingly engaging premise in mind, one would expect the novel to be one madcap, rollicking account of a band of misfits, and an old man's one last jaunt to finally find himself, and not a moment too late. Well, this novel does aspire to be that, and much much more. Perhaps it is the &#34;much much more&#34; that diluted the intent of the story and turned out a tad disappointing, despite evidence of the author's copious research on political events for much of the past century, which Allen, amazingly has quite a hand in shaping. Jonasson no doubt transforms the reader's view of Allen in the light of the chronological history so painstakingly re-imagined and re-fashioned, in chapters that run parallel to those detailing the events after Allen runs away from the home. However, I felt that this novel suffered from an over-ambitious attempt to make Allen's former life count, and unfortunately infringes the &#34;less is more&#34; principle of compelling storytelling.<br /><br />The story loses steam and spirals out of control when the police forces eventually catches up with the motley crew of would-be-criminals, and one gets the sense that the ensuing yarn they spin to the hapless legal prosecutor was more messy and illogical than the author intended. With such a large cast of characters, it was also a bit difficult to get under each of their skin, and they eventually degenerated into trite stereotypes. What was lacking for most of them was the evidence of clear motivation, and it became harder,as the story wore on, for the reader to be truly convinced by the way situations resolve themselves or characters make decisions and change affiliations.

B008CRC506|5.0|I love this series,  music is great. I enjoyed every minute of it.  Shipped well, in perfect condition.  I would buy again.
B0000AVF29|5.0|I was a freshman in college when this album was released in 1967. My vinyl copy is still in excellent shape but I just had to have the CD. I guess Burdon's new release &#34;Til Your River Runs Dry&#34; reminded me about how much I enjoy his unique brand of vocals. Winds of Change includes the hit single &#34;San Franciscan Nights&#34; but the real gem on this album is a tune named &#34;Anything&#34;. As a guitar player myself, I can say that the chord changes in this tune are fantastic. &#34;Good Times&#34; is another great tune on this album. The entire album is outstanding and as the liner notes say, this singinified the change from the &#34;old&#34; Aminals to the &#34;new&#34; Animals. Buy this album. It WILL be worth it.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I do a lot of knitting and this app is perfect for my pdf patterns. I can mark where I am in a pattern, underline important words or lines, make notes, and draw lines through chart rows as I complete them. I am really pleased with the way Repligo works. I do not pay for many apps, butI highly recommend this one.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|This is the story of a relationship gone wrong. Catherine end up having OCD and PTSD, the author is very descriptive about this issue. Cathy's struggle to a normal life is painful.<br /><br />This was difficult to get into because of the way it was set up. We are viewing Catherine's relationship at two different time, one in 2003-04(past) and the other in 2007-08(present). The confusing part is that we get one chapter from the past and the next chapter from the present, back and forth as the story progress. It was very confusing. Of course at one point the past and the present collides.<br /><br />None of the less, after you catch up to the heart of the story, it was very captivating and I couldn't stop reading.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first got Temple Run 2, I'd thought it boring and a waste of time. After then playing a few runs, I was greatly interested.  I realized that I was very good at the turns, jumps, and slides, and that I was far better than anyone else that used my kindle.<br />  So if you are a person with fast thumb and finger reflexes, (which is very important to have when playing Temple Run 2) I would recommend this app to you!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Not sure what's wrong with it, but I could not read the memory cards. So, so far it was an useless investment. Maybe it's just the iPad that's incompatible with the non-apple products.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|If you love baseball and you love Clint Eastwood, than you will enjoy this movie.  Clint is his usual wry and crotchety self.  Story is silly but mildly entertaining.  We watched it in anticipation of the baseball season coming soon.  There are many better baseball movies but we have seen them all already.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is lots of fun,but expensive. I think that it should cost less coins to play the game,but fun! My husband really enjoys this one.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Serves the purpose..very easy to understand. Also the breakdown of the different functions and<br />How much tome ,and battery life left to use makes this little app cool.
B00899E7VM|5.0|I admit that I like musicianship for it's own sake, but I don't believe that out-and-out chops is why I like this album, even if I can't really fault any of the playing here...<br /><br />Other reviewers on amazon have stated that the tempos on this album are sub-optimal.  I'm not counting them out, and they may well be slower than the album versions, but I find these performances to be refreshing, and have re-engaged my interest in this music.<br /><br />I love the musical craft here.  Listen and hear the joy in it.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game controls very well using the tilt functionality of the Kindle fire. This is one game on this system that does not really need a controller. Also the graphics look as good as Sonic 4.
B005I4JG80|2.0|While I appreciate Ms. Druckerman's self-deprecation and self- awareness as she describes herself as a \\"neurotic New Yorker,\\" I would advise her to travel in her OWN country a bit more extensively.  There are good parents everywhere, and the French do not have the corner on common sense.  I read this book hoping to get some new insight into another culture's parenting style, and what I read was a lot of common sense parenting that most of the good, middle-class parents I know already employ.  But these are folks from America's heartland, who do not have the choices (or apparently, the anxieties) of New Yorkers.  The parents I know cannot afford therapy, private schools, or traveling back and forth to Europe.  Maybe this book outlines revolutionary parenting concepts for New Yorkers, but to the rest of us, it sounds like the same stuff mama and grandma have already told us.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am loving this game it changes frequently enough to keep my attention but not hard to keep up my only issues are that I was almost to getting the new York special character and my game reset and I lost everything and now when I am trying to jump I will either roll or move over and vice versa. But over all very enjoyable
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book for anyone that would like to step outside of their world for awhile.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This album is awesome.  What a great mix of sound, lyrics, and different styles of rock.  It doesn't matter to me what I spent on this - the album is priceless and has now become my new prize possession.  I'm 42 years old and it's like I've gone back in time to hear some really great music that I've never heard before from some really good artists that I've never heard of before, yet they have some new funky music that I enjoyed also.  This is now my favorite band and I look forward to purchasing my next Black Keys album.<br /><br />Only one problem - I was able to AutoRip to my laptop but now the songs don't seem to exist anywhere for me to play.

0307956350|2.0|Kate is a CIA agent who has always kept this information from her husband.  As if this big secret will be her undoing.  When her husband gets a job they move.  She feels she's escaped her past by moving away.  Now let me just say you can pack your suitcase but when you get there, you are still yourself. I learned this harsh lesson long ago.  So this book rubbed me the wrong way.  The marriage between Kate and her husband was very childish if you ask me.<br />The characters here were oddly drawn and I could not relate to them.  The plotline hinged on his not knowing she was in the CIA.  She doesn't trust her husband and wonder's about what he really does, etc.  It's like a messy marriage of lies and deceit and yet it was sold to the reader as a thriller.  Um..not for this reader.  Boring, badly written drivel.  A spy thriller?  I saw it as a marriage killer.  Don't read this if you think marriage is about honesty.

B008M4MB8K|5.0|If you don't know what this CLASSIC film is about by now, hand in your film lover's card, you're just a movie goer. You know you want this.<br /><br />When it comes to remastered BDs, this is as good as it gets. Video: 10+ Audio: 10+ Extras: 10+<br /><br />Wondering whether this is as good as the 5 disc Collector's Edition? YES!! It contains all 4 versions of the film plus the RARE \\"Work Print Feature version.\\" Most important of all, it contains the 3 1/2 hour documentary \\"Dangerous Days\\" on the EXTRAS disc. A rare piece of cinema heritage & history. With all the controversy surrounding this CLASSIC, it's a wonder it was made at all.<br /><br />Packaged in a thick glossy cardboard book holder. The pages include some production art & photos. (See Amazon pics.) I would have preferred the original One Sheet poster art on the cover, but oh well. (I own the original 1982 One Sheet, which is priceless to me!) It will fit nicely on the shelf alongside your other BDs. The info on the discs is a little hard to read, but you'll manage.<br /><br />DISC ONE: BD 2007 The Final Cut<br /><br />DISC TWO: BD 1982 Original Theatrical Cut (with the controversial voice-over narration. I was lucky enough to have seen this on the widescreen back in the day), 1982 International Cut (with voice-over & added gore. The 1st version available on VHS for home viewing and the version most hardcore fans are familiar with), 1991 Director's Cut.<br /><br />DISC THREE: BD Special Features. Workprint Feature. \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary & more.<br /><br />LESS than half the price of the 5 disc Edition makes this a MUST OWN purchase for cash-strapped fanboys. ENJOY.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Most blow off this film as a not so good Jim Carey movie. What a mistake! This is a great period movie told through a sentimetal love story that keeps you involved with the characters and the story line. The larger picture of a time of stress and attack on fundamental american values by those who would limit personal freedoms and undermine a free society to pursue their  limited thoughts and controls on society, lay a great foundations for this story. You are able to see such an undermining of fundamental rights refuted by individuals who believe in basic freedoms and stand up for them with in the context of a wonderful love story and story of a town that supports free and opem beliefs. Look for the great period sets, the endearing characters, the great (oscar) performace by Martin Landau, Laurie Holden as the love left behind/ found by another, Hall Holbrook as a distastful government procecutor, and man other superb character performances by actors you will recognize from so many other film character roles. this is an true feel good yet enlightning film that you will enjoy, and has been very muchly underrated. Hope that a blue ray version will come forth as the cinematography and sets really show case an important and beautifil era in our history.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love it!!!! it keeps my stuff.You can set it to have a password so no one can it in to it. You can have more than one notebooks. and it can read it to you to!! this has to be the best app on my kindle!!

B006X5L6VS|1.0|Wasted $ 0.99! I know that isn't much but when you work as hard as I do, it stings to get burned for so much as a penny. I rarely buy apps before reading customer reviews but since I have this app on my iPhone I let my guard down and suffered the consequences. The Kindle Fire HD isn't equipped with GPS which makes this app worthless. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!
B000R3QZ2C|5.0|To me it sounds always strange when some critics write as if they have known the composer personally. - They have discussed with him exactly how he wanted his music to be performed, they know the character of every piece to the last detail. And then they pull their Furtwanglers and Bohms out of the drawer to prove their points. - They don't even seem to think that these composers are dead for more than 200 years and also haven't been known personally by Furtwangler.<br /><br />I personally am delighted to hear to Rattle's recordings of these Haydn Symphonies. They approach me incredibly fresh, naturally flowing and playful. I hear the love for discovering never before heard subtleties, nuances and sound combinations in them. I sense the engagement and joy of the musicians from the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra - a young approach from an orchestra, which has changed so much recently. - I hear magic in the introduction of the Oxford Symphony. -  It's a different kind of magic than in other recordings, but it is there. And I'm happy that I hear it in a different way, making a fresh discovery in this miraculous piece.<br /><br />And I also don't understand the hype about orchestra sizes. - Haydn and Mozart came across a big variety of orchestras. Not only different sizes, also different tunings, different local styles of playing and different concert halls. - And still, they allowed all these orchestras to perform their music. - And I'm quite sure (Mozart told me so) that they enjoyed the variety, as long as the musicians were great and put their soul into their playing. - And that's exactly what I hear in this recordings.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Free version said I could create word, excel, etc documents, but need the full version to edit them from other sources.  Great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after downloading I went to create a word document and it said I needed the full version to do so.  Thus, this is pointless.<br /><br />Full version might be good, but free one is not worth your time, because you can't do anything with it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I love love this book could not put it down. I was laughing so hard with the things that Jamie would say- so innocent.<br />I am so happy that they found each other, sometimes we just need someone to talk to or listen to us. I wish there was more about them after they found each other. Nice to have true friends that will always be there for you. A lot surprise that those ophanage was still around into the ninety's.

1400052181|5.0|The Polio vaccine. Cancer treatments. Effects of radiation and of space on a cell. Stem cell research and cloning. An assortment of widely debated topics. You name it, and HeLa has been there. Taken from a 31 year old African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, these cancerous cells were used in the research of almost every drug stronger than aspirin. And yet, while immensely important to science, they have sparked so many controversial topics, of bio ethnicity and of racism.<br /><br />After reading this book and the entire section on \\"Where They Are Now\\", Henrietta Lacks' family was as close to my heart as my own family. Rebecca Skloot has truly perfected the art of literary journalism, and more specifically, indirect characterization. As Skloot travels through generations, she takes the reader with her, exploring so many perspectives of the same issue, bringing in scientists, and many family members as she could. The subject is an issue so thick with bioethics and scientific issues relevant to the modern world that the reading is not only a joy, as we follow Deborah's personal odyssey, but a brief glimpse into the politics behind the young fields of bioethics. Though we start out with the story of Henrietta Lacks, in truth the main bulk of the book is of Deborah's journey, and from there we pick up many more pieces of Henrietta's life; for example, how its aftermath and scientific backlash affected the Lacks' family even several generations after Henrietta.<br /><br />I loved how Skloot never simply skirted topics, rather she dived right into every single detail and legal precedence. She constantly recreated scenes from people's lives, even those of minor characters, just for that perfect piece of gold, just for one insightful anecdote into a more major character. In a way, I got to experience a whole collage of different viewpoints and experiences, one of the main reasons that I read in the first place. It was like watching a well polished TV series playing out infront of me live - the main character, in this case Deborah, had one main goal, but in order to reach a satisfying conclusion, we had to know the lives of everyone else, too. And I really liked that. The full picture was wonderful, we had no tunnel vision, no storylines lost in favor of the main one.<br /><br />This book was great and extremely informative, and while most of its language is fairly simple, it won't talk down on you, making this book great for almost everyone.

159102594X|5.0|I was wanting to find a new author to read and read about joe abercrombie and his books so i went to my local library and found this book. I was blown away. I haven't read a book that completely sucked me in like this book in a long time! I am a sci fi fantasy nut and this book just fed my addiction. His writing style is intellectual but easy to understand and it is much more life like in the feel of it. Ah! I cannot put into words how much I loved this book and will definitely be reading all of his other books soon!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Awesome book.  Lots of twists and turns.  An unusual end.<br />I'm from New England so cities and towns were all familiar.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I excepted this to be a great case.... For the money. When you are on a phone call, because of the speaker the other person could NEVER hear you. It was so frustrating. Also the part covering the screen was bubbly and made it somewhat hard to type! I'm sure it was great for when you go swimming or on the lake, but for an every day case it's not worth the money.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I actually think I wet myself laughing so hard.  This was classic Seth McFarland at his finest.  Raunchy, raw, completely politically incorrect.  I loved it.  I wouldn't let my kids view if they are under 18!

B003H6KRIE|1.0|I ordered this boxed set of Blueray dvd's in November of 2011 as a Christmas present for my husband.  Unfortunately, we never opened them to play until March 1, 2013.  When we tried to play them, we got an &#34;unavailable&#34; screen on our dvd player.  At first, we thought we weren't loading them correctly, or there was an issue with the dvd player, but other dvd's are working fine.  I'm very disappointed that we didn't try them as soon as we got them, so they could have been returned.  I guess we will use them as a paperweight...

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Suffers is a very addictive game. I find it more interesting than Te mple Run. I really like this game. My only complaint is that to get it started up it takes longer than should to load. Fix this problem and my vote would be five stars.
B0026772N8|5.0|I knew what this was about for years before I read it, but I was afraid it was too intellectual for me.  Not at all.  Its a great read on many levels.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Fabulous dark comedy with wonderful Cat Stevens music.  Harold is a young man who is consumed with thoughts of death, suicide and funerals.  He meets Ruth Gordon, (Maude) an almost 80 year old semi professional mourner.  Together they fulfill each other's sordid fascination and fall in love.
0670026603|5.0|This book is guaranteed to break your heart. And it is pretty deceptive in the beginning. I had no idea I was about to be swept away by heart wrenching emotion. Louisa is a typical out of work lass with no direction, soon Will Traynor enters the picture and life changes for both good and bad. There are important ethical questions, including one of the most important about freedom over one's own life. Well worth the read.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Merlin is so entertaining and the characters are engaging. I am so sad the the series was cancelled due to poor ratings.
1596912863|3.0|I love Austen, so many people love Shannon Hale.  I thought I would try this mix of both.<br />While it is fun in many parts, I was disappointed in a few too many places that were just crude.  Why were they even in there?  I like a good clean story that doesn't make me cringe.  For instance the reference the gardener makes to his balls if he gets in trouble, and also her jumping up an wrapping her legs around same gardener's waist, even IF there were layers of fabric from her skirt and underthings there.  These are just two examples, and there were more.  Maybe I am a bit of a prude, but I think I can enjoy a book without that in it.<br />The relationship between Jane and Mr. Nobley was fun to watch change, and it did end well, especially the stuff at the airport.<br />The idea for this story had merit though.  Yes, all Austen fans usually want a Mr. Darcy, I have had my moments.  But, when it all boils down to it, I'd prefer my Captain Wentworth instead.
B007712XAU|5.0|Downton Abbey is addicting. The acting is superb! the story draws you in and you just want to walk into the screen and join the characters! I cannot wait for the next season!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's nice to know when The Sexy Fire is running hot. It got to 107 degrees in the summer once. I also love the feature that plays a sound at the user's desired level of battery. I use 100%, 10% and 5%. You can also have it talk to you and say the battery level.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This movie kept me wondering what would happen next. Most bond movies, you know whats next. He does a good job playing Bond although not as good as some others. The movie was good and I will watch again sometime.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Love the TV show, as there's always a good joke. Very funny. Short episodes are convenient to a busy lifestyle and it's easy to pick up anywhere in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked it because it kept you guessing about what was going to happen next. Hope they make into a movie..
B000JMKTLO|3.0|While I enjoyed Gone Girl much more, Sharp Objects is still a very good read in its own right. It's not a terribly difficult-to-solve whodunit; anyone who has watched a Lifetime movie or two will be able to figure it out quite quickly.<br /><br />It's the details that really make this novel stand out- Camille's loneliness, her need to cut herself, the meanness of people, the heartbreak one person can enjoy inflicting on another. Sharp Objects captures the essence of cruelty perfectly.<br /><br />It was an incredibly fast read, at least for me. Around 8 hours total, maybe (split up between a few evenings). It's not a feel good, by any means, but if you're looking for a quick and engaging read, this is definitely a strong choice.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I'm not a senior reviewer for no reason. I have 200 reviews on this site and trust it more than any other travel site. Those that contribute with their reviews are generally very knowledgable and honest. When I want to check out a restaurant or hotel, etc. it't the only place I go. You get inpute from people of all ages and all walks of life. The site is very easy to understand and get around on. It's fun to submit reviews and hopefully help someone else out. The service on this site is top rate. Give Trip Advisor a try and I'm sure you'll go back time after time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used several keyboard apps for Android, and I never went away from using SwiftKey since I installed it. Word prediction is the best feature, and it works really well. Flow is good, but sometimes doesn't predict what I'm trying to type, thus making me go back and delete one or more words.<br /><br />Overall though, SwiftKey is my favorite and go-to keyboard.

B004S49YEM|4.0|I chose to read this book as I am an avid reader of Ken Follett novels, having been hooked by &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.<br />Again, he did not disappoint.  The subject was obviously well researched and written in a way that kept the reader involved and<br />expectant.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was exciting and adventurous.  It was an easy read and followed the previous two books with an exciting ending.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|My new favorite CD. Clear, solid sound, not bootleg flat. Should have been officially released 41 years ago. The band is firing on all cylinders, Duane is insane, Gregg is passionately involved, & Berry's bass is upfront. Sounds like your sitting in the middle of em. Different feel than Fillmore, but in a refreshing way. Same intensity & quality of recording, yet more to the point, in your face burning blues. Perfect party CD. Followers of Duane, you need this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so fun and addicting.  Great for the whole family.<br />Even my 3 year old likes it, my 11 year old and her dad have a competition going, and she is kicking his butt.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I picked up my first two Vince Flynn novels in hardcover from the sale rack at a bookstore six months ago.  Liking what I read, I sought out his other novels and was pleased to find paperback versions of all but two in a local used book store.  This was my very first &#34;kindle book&#34; purchase, and I have now read everything Mr. Flynn has written and have never been disappointed!  Looking forward to the next one!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|if you love Greek myths you will love this book! Its great because it includes action and adventure, the hole time i red this book i was sitting on the edge of my seat.It took me about 5 days to finish because it was so good.

B0010SKSTO|4.0|I think that this is a good, solid book on body language. It captures a lot of subtle nuances which are often forgotten in body language literature, although I think that it might be a bit tricky to wrap your head around if you are new to the area.
B008H5J510|4.0|I love Katy Perry and enjoyeds watching this biography, but wish they would have included her full concert as well.

B0017M413M|5.0|A must watch after the end of SG-1.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The film is the conclusion of Stargate SG-1's Ori arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of Stargate Atlantis.  SG-1 discovers a box that they believe contains the Ark while digging on Dakara, but before they can open it, Ori soldiers arrive, led by Tomin. Daniel tricks them into opening the box, but it is revealed to be a fake. When Tomin is ordered by a Prior to kill them, he refuses, and Mitchell kills the Prior, whose powers were being blocked by the Anti-Prior device. Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender.  When the Ark is activated and opened, the Doci is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers. With Adria now in a weakened state, Morgan is able to engage her in an eternal battle. SG-1 exposes the Prior on Earth to the Ark, transmitting the knowledge about the Ori to all of the Priors in the Milky Way, and thus turning all known Priors in the Universe.

B000Y0OCEQ|5.0|I have to say this is on of the best shows ever produced.  So many seasons, and has great action, story lines, and characters.  I have watched this from start to finish many times.<br /><br />Season 2:<br />Vaitiare Bandera, who plays Sha're, was actually pregnant with Michael Shanks' child during the filming of \\"Secrets\\".  \\"Holiday\\" gained a 4.2 rating on the Nielsen ratings, making it Stargate SG-1's strongest episode in its ten-season run.<br /><br />Season 2 has 22 episodes and aired in 1998.

B00821OW8K|5.0|I came across this Series after hearing a few talk about it.  I decided to check it out, and I am glad I did.  I was hooked right off the bat.  Great story line, great cast with many new faces, keep me glued to the TV and wanting to watch the next episode one after the other.<br /><br />Whats its about:<br />The first season picks up six months after the invasion and follows a group of survivors who band together to fight back. The group, known as the Second Massachusetts (an allusion to a historical regiment from the Continental Army), is led by the retired Captain Weaver and Boston University history professor Tom Mason who, while in search of his son Ben, must put his extensive knowledge of military history into practice as one of the leaders of the resistance movement.<br /><br />Once you finish season 1, you will want to jump right into season 2.

B0011BBA2E|5.0|I have to say this is on of the best shows ever produced.  So many seasons, and has great action, story lines, and characters.  I have watched this from start to finish many times.<br /><br />Season 6:<br />\\"Redemption\\" features a brand new opening sequence, with various shots of the gate spinning, and Michael Shanks' name being removed to make way for Corin Nemec's in between Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis. In most of the shots in \\"Abyss\\" where Ba'al is talking to O'Neill, Cliff Simon is actually talking to a stand-in for O'Neill and not Richard Dean Anderson due to the limited time Richard Dean Anderson had in which to film the episode.Most of \\"Paradise Lost\\" was shot at Pitt Lake, near Vancouver.<br /><br />Season 6 has 22 episodes and aired in 2002.
0756407125|4.0|The story is gripping, but it seems as if the author finished the first book without fully planning the second. This means there are credibility gaps between the two volumes,especially given the timeline of the tale. I had expected to take the story up after he was expelled from the University, not to explore the pre expulsion wold more fully. The characters are well developed and interesting. A mix of romance, bravery, adversity and youthful folly is well blended and balanced and keeps the reader intrigued. I'm not sure that Devi is completely credible, but it is a fantasy, so anything goes.<br />I look forward to the third book to continue the tale and resolve the questions. I would recommend the book to any fantasy lover of teenage years to older persons.
0061906220|5.0|My 2 year old Grandson has fallen in love with this book.  Also I am a children's librarian and the kids I do story time for ask for this book each time I come.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|Might just be me, but if you were to try and log into Ebay through the web part of the Kindle Fire, it won't work.<br /><br />I had to download the Ebay App to log into my account and do any ordering.<br /><br />I feel this app needs more features though. More like the PC ebay.
0307352153|4.0|I really liked this book and learned a lot by reading it. Its both an evaluation of the place of introverts in our culture and a warning that introverts' position in society is in rapid decline. Cain points out how both schools and workplaces are moving toward a \\"team\\" concept that rewards outgoing, talkative people and leaves introverts--those individuals who do their best thinking and work alone--in a world of constant chatter and continuous interaction.<br /><br />The author also issues a stern warning to parents not to treat an introverted child like something is wrong with them and force them to be more aggressive and more social. Introverts are not better or worse than extraverts and, in the case of historical figures like Rosa Parks, can make important contributions to society. As an introvert, I applaud Ms. Cain for her pioneering effort to set the record straight and highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to spend time by themselves and is made to feel guilty for wanting that quiet time.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This is now my favorite album of all time, and its a great price to, defiantly a must buy !
B00AO686L0|4.0|Much of the Oscar buzz 14 years ago was about Michael Mann's The Insider, an intense, stylized dramatization about Jeffrey Wigand, the former Brown & Williamson tobacco executive who went public with history-making revelations on the iconic CBS newsmagazine show, 60 Minutes.<br /><br />Ironically, to my teenage daughter, who has grown up in a world in which cigarettes are not the norm in most public places and seemingly always known to be harmful, it's hard to conceive of the magnitude of Wigand's revelations, aside from the chemical additives. Why would the \\"seven dwarfs\\" need to lie in court when everyone know smoking isn't good for you? There was a time when it wasn't completely acknowledged and an industry would do anything to keep it that way.<br /><br />What my daughter did see, however, is one of the reasons that Russell Crowe earned his stature as an A-list actor, beyond just being that guy in Les Miz who wasn't singing as well as the others. His Oscar-nominated performance in The Insider (also nominated for director Mann and the film istelf) is worthy of the highest praise, as is that of Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer and a fine supporting cast that includes Michael \\"Gandalf\\" Gambon, Colm Feore and even WKRP in Cincinnati star Gary Sandy (scowling in the shadows as a sinister lawyer).<br /><br />Speaking of shadows, there are a lot of them in The Insider, along with lots of long, pensive passages punctuated with moody music, odd shots that lingering on extraneous areas of the set or people, close ups on patterns and shapes and pretty much everything that was very much in vogue after Mann's pop culture sensation, Miami Vice -- and its MTV-influence use of color, camera movement and editing -- set the tone for film and TV. Even TV shows of today rely on moody montages set to a contemporary or classic tune to button up an episode.<br /><br />But when you've got Pacino, Crowe, Plummer and the rest, why jiggle the camera around as if my sister was videotaping a birthday party? Often the style actually gets in the way of the drama, vies for the viewer's attention and only adds to the film's length rather than adding to the mood.<br /><br />It's the equivalent of a late '60s musical in which things are just beginning to roll along when a character sits down and sings. In a musical, songs say what dialogue cannot, and it's an art to know where to put them. The same is true for signature filmmaking style.<br /><br />When not done to excess, these creative touches can be impressive, and the Blu-ray shows them off to their best advantage. This is especially evident in scenes painted with color, like the driving range sequence in which Crowe is drenched in a green tint that rivals Margaret Hamilton. Many of the sets are truly striking. Even a simple hotel hallway takes on its own personality.<br /><br />This is an interesting time in history to watch The Insider again -- or for the first time -- knowing what you know about the events that happened since, particularly in big business and mass entertainment. Al Pacino's character cannot defiantly run his version of the report on YouTube in this era. CBS isn't the conglomerate that it and its rival networks are today. Could an expos&eacute; like Wigand's interview even be considered for network TV now -- or would it break on the internet first?<br /><br />And what of Wigand's fate? On the one hand, big business is bigger than ever and the reach is longer. On the other, there are things like the Whistleblower Protection Act and other efforts to keep these individuals from retaliation.<br /><br />The Insider a riveting story that takes on a new dimension in light of where we are now, and where we need to go. You just have to be patient with the shaking camera and the other distracting affectations.birthday party?

B0042JIL24|4.0|This is a must have for any Pearl Jam and vinyl fan. Double vinyl album and CD with all the extras its a steal. You cant beat the price well under priced on Amazon compared to other online sites. I have seen this as high as 150.00.<br /><br />Totally pleased with the sound quality, very well mixed and not just a novelty to have on album.<br /><br />The only thing that threw me off was Amazon category was listed as CD but this is indeed the delux box set with double vinyl.<br /><br /> I would have given this 5 stars but one of the repro concert posters was damaged. Either way I got really what I wanted the vinyl and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Grab this one while you can at 60 bucks its a steal.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I've seen a lot of complaints that the game is unbeatable because you cannot wall jump on level 8.  it's true that the wall jumps won't work on the left, but the game is beatable. it's just not easy which made it more fun. you've gotta work for the win.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I cannot write much because if it so complicated.  So many twists and turns and so many subplots and side stories, it made my head spin.  Consequently, it was hard to follow the main story, if there was one.  I usually love these two authors and have high praise for their books,  but this one is the exception.  Sorry, fellows.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read English as a second language, so I really enjoyed it. It's very clear and, in my modest opinion, very nicely written. The story is good, but you can anticipate several of the outcomes, so it's a pity not to be surprised, especially in the end!
0385535147|4.0|Very well written with a lot of twists and turns throughout the book.  The ending caught me by surprise and a great ending it is.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Though this isn't their best album, I think it's pretty good. Better than The Resistance. My favorites are Madness, Animals, and Big Freeze. I only gave it 4 stars cuz it's not as good as their other albums.

B005XI91FY|5.0|The other wordy reviews cover everything that is good about Balls Out.  The lyrics are lurid and hilarious, musicianship is good and Michael Starr uses lots of different vocal variations on different tracks.  Once you download this just delete &#34;in the future&#34; it is a vocal intro not a song.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to play if you are sitting at the doctors and need to pass time while waiting!  I can play this anywhere and it's a great challenge to try and see how fast I can complete a game.

B00005J6T0|5.0|Each track on this cd was either moving, reminded me of 80's Madonna or instilled an upbeat feeling in me.  This cd demonstrates Madonna's melodic innovation and lyrical prowess.<br /><br />I recommend this cd to all Madonna fans.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I never read fiction but when I continued to hear about this book on Security Now I had to check it out. I don't have much to compare it so all I can say is that is was a really fun read for someone interested in computer security such as myself.
B008YJFF2M|5.0|Every track on the cd did one of three things:  Remind me of my favorite Bond movie, remind me of my favorite scene in the Bond movie tied to the particular song or made me wish I could remember more of the movie tied to the track playing at the time.<br /><br />Shirley Bassey's performances of Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever and Moonraker were the best parts of the cd.  Nancy Sinatra, Lulu, Sheena Easton, A-Ha, Tina Turner, Sheryl Crow, Garbage and Madonna's tracks on the cd were equally spectacular.<br /><br />I would recommend this cd for all James Bond fans.

B007ZUVJGC|5.0|This very readable book gave me a lot of hope for my brother-in-law, who did suffer a stroke in November. He is much better now than we thought he was going to be, and I believe the book helped.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Enough has already been said about the superior content and technical quality of the DVD set, to which I add an enthusiastic, &#34;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.&#34;  What I'd like to mention is the fortunate inclusion in the audio selections of PCM,  I do not have a 5.1 setup and rely on conventional stereo for sound.  If there was no PCM option, I would lose the bass.  I wouldn't have bought it if that had been the case.  I am grateful that the menu gives the option for conventional stereo systems without sacrificing fidelity.  That really makes this set a winner for my situation.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|I side-loaded Dolphin via Goodereader onto my Kindle Fire HD. I did this because I wanted to watch 4od and itv player. The Amazon kindle fire does not support 4od or ITV-player. Now I am able to watch these with  no problems, thanks to Dolphin.
B001CL4N68|5.0|I was embarrassed when I realized I didn't have this on my mp3 player so I looked it up. For 2.99 they may as well be giving it away
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|this is a musical. it is a horrible representation of one of the best novels ever written. I really like Keira Knightley and this was not anything close to what she usually does.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Some complain that it is not good as the comic. well, duh....  But it is the best we could ever expect. Great story that loses very little from the comic.<br />In fact I enjoyed this as much as I did the original story back in the day...
B00APUTEBG|3.0|I only purchased the movie because of Bruce Willis, but with him dying in the first 10 minutes of the movie it was quite a dissapointment... I did like the scenes of Spain though...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics in this app are fantastic kids and adults both would just love it! I'm happy I have it on my Kindle Fire and would absolutely recommend it for everyone.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie follows in the same vein as Wes' other movies- set in the mid -late 60's, lots of quick wit and funny banter. The story follows a runaway Boy Scout trying to find his true love.<br /><br />I loved this movie and I think if you liked any other Wes Anderson movie then there is no question- you should watch this.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a fun game. I really enjoyed playing it. The graphics were amazing and I enjoyed the story line.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love these books one of my favorite series!!! Can't wait to read the next one, already been bought and now I own them all!! Second time reading material!
B000002HEM|5.0|I must admit I have a soft spot in my heart for this CD. It's great &#34;date music&#34;, but it is also a solid disc from top to bottom. I always repeat her (oops... I mean their) rendition of Springsteen's Because The Night when I listen. It's that good. A nicely poignant record.
