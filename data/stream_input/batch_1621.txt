0061997811|5.0|Simply put, it's a great book that both adults (myself) and kids (my child) can enjoy.<br /><br />I love all the features and inserts (Ministry of Magic ID, Advanced Potions book with stickers etc, etc, etc). The level of details is amazing.<br /><br />Actual *reading* (as opposed to looking at the pics) was a lot of fun. It is fascinating to learn how these movies came to be.<br /><br />I guess this is not a very informative review; but if you like the fandom, buy this book. It's very well written, with lots of details, fun facts and great pictures.

1932100660|5.0|The product I received is absolutely fantastic and what I was expecting.  I have borrowed and read this book a few years earlier, and would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in living a healthy lifestyle or has an interest in nutrition.  You are what you eat most of the time, and the right diet can totally transform your life, improve your life expectancy and optimise your health. I have used the information in this book to inform a health program I run.

0385344333|1.0|Like so many other reviewers here, I have to say \\"it had to happen.\\"  At some point (possibly about four novels ago) Lee Child has out-sourced his writing and in the process, has forever tarnished his once great Jack Reacher series.  This new story (A Wanted Man) was clearly not written by Child and it could not be more apparent.  All of the ideas and settings in this story have just been re-hashed from novels past in an obvious attempt to keep it safe and acsessible.<br /><br />How many blonde attractive female FBI agents are there?  Well I think over the journey Reacher has surely met each and everyone of them now.  How many more times can we look forward to hearing more about the most boring sedan in the world, the Crown Vic?  How many more times can we expect to get excited over \\"Child's\\" verbal masturbation regarding the Glock 17/19 pistols?<br /><br />I could go on and on and on, but my point has been made.  Far too many Reacher books have now been ruined by the constant repetition of old ideas to flesh out \\"new\\" stories.  If the Reacher series is to continue then I can only see two ways out of the rut.  With Child and Child alone at the keyboard he must get Reacher out of his comfort zone and back into some sort of normality or just stick to the prequels so Child can put Reacher back into the prime of his life and get down and dirty again with some super-charged action scenes and where more than Reacher's pride is at stake.<br /><br />I don't mind a Reacher book that has little or no action as long as it is relevent and fresh.  I'd like to see Reacher in action again but without the ridiculous and predictable alliance with FBI/LE who at first don't trust him but soon are only too willing to hand over the investigation to him.  I'm done with all of that crap and all of the tiresome millitary input too.  Time for a new start or time to just end it, but something has got to give because this rubbish is just not good enough.
0307744434|1.0|So much hype, so much disappointment.<br /><br />The summary was catching, but the following made the book one of the most taxing book-reading experiences yet.<br /><br />1) It takes forever for anything to happen. It felt that scenes were dragged on and on and on, serving no real purpose one way or another. There were plenty of chapters I started and just knew I was going to have to brave through it, only to find nothing for it in the end.<br /><br />2) The writing is lovely. The author knows how to make a sentence pretty but when you pair it with the above part, it's an endless description of someone and their clock making (maybe some people like that). I understand the circus is supposedly the `main character'. That doesn't excuse how boring its construction came across to me. There is also the matter of being too flowery (and switching verb tenses) and I had to focus to untangle what one particular sentence meant.<br /><br />3) Main characters fell flat. Marcus seemed like a guy who just ran after the next sparkly thing that caught his eyes. I had no sympathy for him, had no understanding of his professed `love' for the main girl, and felt he manipulated too many people without the redeeming qualities necessary for me to like him.<br /><br />The main girl was equally not worth my time. I was more confused as to her personality than annoyed/disliking her. So, it's no surprise I didn't care about their interest in one another or where it went. The only characters I found interesting were the twins, who I thought had stronger personalities and voices than anyone else.<br /><br />Neither of the characters seem to care much for the competition they're forced into. It shows. It makes me not care if they have nothing to lose. Anything at \\"stake\\" (if it could be labeled as that) comes far too late after a random character is thrown into the mix.<br /><br />On that note, there are way too many point of view changes. Maybe some people like that. I find it difficult to learn about any one character if the POV changes constantly. I've only seen it executed well in a few epic fantasy novels and this book is no exception.<br /><br />4) The overall `fantasy' elements and plot. I had too many questions about it at the end. It's fine to leave some things open, especially if it's meant to be ambiguous, but I had so many questions about how/why it came together. Things revolving around that just appeared fickle and I couldn't really enjoy the magical qualities when they made me tilt my head too many times.<br /><br />Why does this competition need to take place? This is only one of many `whys' I had. I don't need everything to be answered but when there are loop holes and seemingly no explanation whatsoever, it takes away from the experience.<br /><br />Boring, unlikeable characters, a plot that doesn't get going until the end (sort of), and a bunch of pretty writing that can't be appreciated.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Based on Sol Yurick's novel, inspired by the gangs and kid mercenaries in of all things, Xenophon's The Anabasis. However, instead of ancient Greek armies fighting their way to the Black Sea, the titular gang fights their way back to Coney Island in Brooklyn, taking on a slew of gangs from the corny to the fearsome.<br /><br />Interestingly, Yurick hated the movie and thought the character of Cyrus was dreadful (hey, Stephen King hated The Shining too, which was a fantastic film so what do authors know?).<br /><br />The film in undeniably cheesy (The Union Square subway roller skating gang?) but the opening sequence is wonderfully creepy and the settings are terrific as is the music.<br /><br />Warrior gangster Ajax went on to become Dexter's flashback dad on that show and there are many snippets of memorable dialogue, including a radio DJ wishing the gang well as they try and fight their way home. \\"Can you dig it?\\" \\"Warriors, come out to play-iy-ay\\" became incorporated into 90s rap and the Furies gang were the inspiration for a video by Eminem.<br /><br />VERY fun, action-packed, dated dialogue, with some of the best scenes of old gritty New York you'll ever see outside of Taxi Driver.

B000KX0IOK|3.0|Usually, in movies of this type Caucasian teachers are parachuted into some hellhole school and learn to inspire black students who serve as cardboard cut-out background material while carpe diem triumphalism takes hold.<br /><br />In Half Nelson, (a strangely titled 'pro-wrestling hold as drug abuse' metaphor) Ryan Gosling is a hipster history/gym teacher in an as yet un-gentrified predominantly black Brooklyn school whose life spirals out of control as he wallows in self-destruction/cocaine abuse.<br /><br />Gosling is compelling and troubled teacher's pet Shareeka Epps a remarkable stand-out.<br /><br />Minus one and a half stars for a lack of back-story contributing to Mr Dunne's downfall, the lack of peripheral friendships (one can't imagine a guy as gregarious as the protagonist, being such a loner than none of his friends steps in to intervene as he loses control) and  pacing.<br /><br />In short, overly performance-driven but these are two masterful performances.

0393338398|5.0|Billy Beane's approach was brilliant.  And he is proving it again and again.  It was a simple premise that Lewis began to explore when he followed Beane around.<br /><br />The story is comprehensive, well written and he followed the A's very nicely from the beginning to the end of the season.  It was interesting to see all the research as he went back to a couple of previous drafts that helped to build the 2002 Oakland A's.<br /><br />If you're a baseball junkie you've got to read this.  It was perhaps one of the best baseball books that I've read.

B002HWRYJE|2.0|This a prequel to all that's Star Trek.<br /><br />Kudos to the Casting Director.  Especially for the Bones McCoy actor.  He just looked, sounded and felt like the young Bones.  Good acting there.  If you weren't looking, you'd think it was the old Bones (DeForest Kelley).  The rest of the cast did a good, workman like job.<br /><br />In general, the plot was interesting.  However, it was presented in a contrived fashion.  The insertion of \\"the past\\" often seemed like commercial breaks to an otherwise good story.<br /><br />So, I found it watchable, mildly interesting; but, I can't ever see myself watching it again.

1433531569|3.0|This review is for the Personal Size Chocolate / Blue version of the ESV Study Bible.  (Amazon mixes reviews for \\"versions\\" of the same text.)  The Bible is lovely.  It's a bit more Robin's Egg blue than in the picture.  I was looking for a thorough but still portable study Bible in a fairly word for word translation.  I like this version of the ESV Study Bible b/c it has great content, images, maps, etc., but loses the 150 or so pages of general commentary that makes the larger version so huge.  I really do wish, though that they'd have made it an inch taller to avoid the eye-strain.  Another reviewer said the font size was good... I think it's far too small for thin Bible pages - given that there is a slight shadow from the other side of the page the font should have been a size up (at least) to make life easier.  I do love it, though.  I am actually considering getting a pair of \\"cheaters\\" (though I am no where near that stage of life) to make using it bearable.

Chris Hemsworth does a great job considering how thinly written his character is. Charlize Theron is fantastic at depicting the witch as irredeemably evil and extremely broken.  Kristen Stewart is, well, pretty. Too bad she portrays the main character.

0938045768|5.0|Not much I can add to the many positive reviews.<br />I got this book after reading these reviews and recovering from a blown  L5-S1 disc doing kettle bell swings. (glad to read Bruce Lee screwed his back up doing good mornings)<br /><br />A few bullet points (no pun intended)<br />- it doesn't matter if the author was incarcerated or not. The information is unbeatable. I suspect the author was a gymnast. But it's pretty hard to sell \\"How to get a body like Kurt Thomas\\"<br />- achievable very well structured progressions.<br />-excellent explanations of natural body movements.<br />-nice background history on body builders/strongmen in the pre-Arnold era. (YouTube  the \\"Mighty Atom\\" )<br />-this is NOT a book that will \\"transform \\" your body in 90 days. It is a book that will give you a lifetime of fitness. It will eventually give you a Jason Statham body  and  let you one day  become  of those 85 year old guys doing 1-armed pushups at your Gym.<br /><br />Two tips that are helping me during my startup.<br />-Before you are ready to start bridges, start early by stretching your back by doing the Cobra yoga position.<br />-I use an iPhone app called RPM that helps me keep count because each rep takes about 5 seconds to complete.

B009329ZF2|5.0|When I first viewed the Battleship trailer, I thought this would be a great science fiction movie.  When I was actually able to view the movie, I thought it was amazing.  The special effects were awesome and the acting superb.  I don't know why this movie received such bad reviews.  John Carter also received bad reviews, but I rented the movie, liked it and decided to buy it.  I am going to do the same with Battleship.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I love the fast service and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com.  I also enjoy the great prices.  If you have an off day with nothing planned, grab \\"The Bourne Trilogy\\", get a blanket, and enjoy an action packed day of ooh' and ekk's and oh dang's!!

0345803485|1.0|So I read this just wanting to see what all the hype was about. And to see what an erotic book spawned from twilight was like. What surprises me most is that I actually read the whole thing! Not going to lie, the storyline had me hooked only wanting to know where it all lead. And to my disappointment, it lead nowhere. I'm not a professional writer, which you can probably tell from this review since I probably have tons of typos, but there were way to my grammical errors for me actually enjoy any scene. The thing that got me the most was the constant repition of \\"holy\\" this and \\" holy\\" that; and Anna having to describe Christian every time she looked at him. It's like ok, he's hot! I understood that from the first 10 pages! Not to mention that Anna has to be the only college student without an email address (especially since you're required to have one these days). Theres just so much that doesn't make since. Smith probably should have made this take place in the 80s or something. Better yet the whole book should have been from Christian's point view. I imagine it would have been much more interesting and slightly less annoying following sadist millionaire rather than the annoying naive self doubting virgin and her \\"inner goddess\\".

I love the movie and would love to own it but this now will make me hesitate from buying movies online through amazon dealers.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I always felt that this version of the Titanic story is sooo overblown. Always prefer A NIGHT TO REMEMBER as THE Titanic story. But this review is not for the movie TITANIC, but the blu ray release (after all these years!) of this tragic tale in history. Funny, after witnessing this spectacular blu ray (in 2D) I have a better appreciation for this Academy Award winner. I have had TITANIC on Laserdisc and DVDs and this is like watching it with new eyes. Paramount has done one fantastic restoration of this film. The detail is astounding as it should be! Never has this film ever looked so good (except IMAX).  And the sound is great in surround sound (too bad Paramount didn't carry over their 6.1 mix from the DVD) for 5.1.<br />So don't believe what some people are saying that Paramount just wants to \\"cash in\\" with a re-release. This is NOT a re-release. This is just another format and thankfully it makes this movie look its best. This film has never been on blu ray and its about time! What took so lomg?<br />I just can't wait to get a 3D TV so I can experience this movie in an even better way!<br />Maybe the best transfer of the year.

B008602KQI|5.0|I read the Hunger Games Trilogy and, of course, was captivated by the story. Like everyone else, I was excited to see the movie and was most pleased with the transition from book to film. The settings were as I envisioned them, the cast was great, and I loved the musical score. I appreciated the downplay of gore in spite of the violence throughout the story.<br /><br />I especially liked the female lead in the story, Katniss Everdeen, beautifully portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She is brave, mature and wise for her young age. She is also smart, skilled, resourceful, loving, and compassionate. Quite a good role model for girls and young women of today.<br /><br />This movie is now part of my DVD collection. I watch it again and again and highly recommend it. I hope that anyone who is a fan of the Hunger Games book will want to own the film. You'll not only be entertained but be reminded of the struggles between the haves and the have-not's.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I read everything Jack Reacher related including the shorts. This is another great addition to the series and I just can't get enough of Reacher and the way that he handles the situations that are put in front of him. I loved the way that A Wanted Man took off straight after the end of Worth Dying For. I love reading series books because I get invested in the characters and I can't wait for the next installment of Jack Reacher. Thank you Lee for another great book.

B005FVNIW6|5.0|I LOVE this book. It just has everything, drama, intelligent political issues, bright and interesting characters and a plot that is fantastic. But most of all it is a HUMAN story full of human failing and human passions. I re-read this book every few years. The rest of this series is also wonderful.
B002APU580|1.0|This movie could have been wonderful but was quite horrid.  Jane Austen created some of the best characters in literature and this movie changes just about everybody of importance, removing the wit and turning it into soppy porridge.  Mr. Bennet is one of my favorite characters of all time  and his character was unrecognizable.  Jane was supposed to be sweet and kind and yet she came across as hard and cold in the movie.  Lizzie is intelligent and perhaps a tiny pit pert but not silly and ridiculous as she is portrayed here.  Mr. Darcy was also a sad failure.  He was dour rather than proud and seemed about to cry throughout the movie.  Ish.<br /><br />Plus, I had serious issues with the behavior portrayed in the movie.  Regency women DID NOT run around with their hair down!  Every time I saw that, it infuriated me and pulled me out of the movie.  Darcy and Elizabeth would have never met up in the morning in their night clothes.  This is the equivalent of wandering down the street naked.  To top it off, the director then had Darcy go to ask for Lizzie's hand in the same night clothes, with his collar open and no cravat!  Are you kidding me?!!<br /><br />The manners of everyone in the movie were awful.  Lydia was silly and heedless in the book but Jane and Lizzie were not!  The costuming was also sub-par.  Lizzie's dresses were all wrong.  First, she looked like a servant in dowdy colors and fabrics.  Why dress the lead in such an awful fashion?  Her clothes shouldn't have been as fine as the Bingley sisters but Lizzie was not a poor farm girl.  Second, the waist was much too low for the time period.<br /><br />I was left with the very strong impression that the director felt that he had to distinguish himself by \\"improving\\" on the original.  Sad, bad, pompous mistake.  The BBC version was so fabulous that I think he tried much too hard to make this one stand apart from it.  Well, he achieved his goal.  The BBC version is amazing and this one is atrocious.  It could have been great.

1400148251|5.0|Something Wicked This Was Comes was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.  I picked it up immediately after Fahrenheit 451, which was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked.  Bradbury is probably more responsible than any other single author for my love of reading, and for that he has my eternal gratitude.<br /><br />Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are wonderful characters, in many ways alike (hence their nearly unbreakable bond of friendship), but in some ways very different (hence that bond's almost being broken)---and I could relate very much to them both when I was about their age (and to some extent still).  Mr. Halloway is wonderful as well, and I've always had a special affection for him and his beloved library stacks.<br /><br />Rereading it now as an adult, it doesn't stand up quite as well as some of his other books, but it still shines with that irrepressible Bradbury spirit.  It's quite entertaining and a lot of fun even for grown-ups, at least those of us who haven't become too jaded.  There's just something almost inherently thrilling to the child in all of us about the idea of a dark, October carnival.<br /><br />And the book is a bit dark, at least on its surface, even compared with Bradbury's other Green Town stories (notably Dandelion Wine) which were themselves actually kind of dark.  Like them, it deals with death, but more specifically and directly in a more focused novel.  But in the end, it is a story of light and life, as Bradbury puts death in its proper place, concluding: \\"Is Death important? No. Everything that happens before Death is what counts.\\"<br /><br />Four and a half stars.
0307730697|5.0|I just read this book last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It is incredible, the author  just drew you into the story. I fell in love with the whole Brown family. Kelly is incredible. This is a book I will reread. It is more than the life of a navy seal it is a story of one who has found himself and the calling for his life.
0425263908|3.0|I'm new to reading erotic fiction, and frankly, after the sophomoric tripe that is 50 Shades, I thought I was doomed, considering everyone keeps fawning over it as if it's brilliant. 'Bared to You' actually made me think I might read more (erotic fiction). The characters have a bit more depth, the writing is at least a dozen times better and more cohesive and unlike 50 Shades, the heroine doesn't remind me of a pubescent child; at least I could sort of relate to her. In 'Bared to You', there's some stalker-ish behaviour, and granted, as one reviewer said everyone is beautiful, but I certainly felt as if I could identify a little more with the main characters.<br /><br />As for people who claim this is 'too like 50 Shades' are you kidding me? There have been plenty of dom/sub or BDSM slanted novels that I've found reference to that pre-date 50 Shades; it's neither a unique idea, nor the first. Sylvia Day's dialogue is more interesting, and Eva, the heroine, is far more likeable than Ana IMHO.<br /><br />I would pick this book before 50 Shades in a heartbeat. That being said it still lacks something for me; a bit of aw shucks with her roommate or predictability and complexity in the characters that would make it really brilliant. At times it seems contrived and it tries too hard. 3.5 stars.

B0088X7YU0|4.0|Parts 2 and 3 are piss poor movies with good actors, bad direction, and are cheap ploys to make a quick buck off of the us real fans of the franchise. Trust me im being nice!<br /><br />This movie is kind of a restart that more closely imitates the book (according to the Japanese makers of this film) but it is a pretty good add on to the first flick! I was expecting a realy cheesy movie with horrible motion artifacts and boring gaps of wasted time and OK CG effects that make the hole thing barely tolerable. I was soooooo wrong!<br /><br />There CG work is detailed and well thought out and the special effects are fantastic. The story is big in scope and rather scary when the bugs' plan is finaly revealed. The threat of the bugs has been stepped up bigtime.<br /><br />As an ameture computer animator I can spend alot of time critisizing a lot of little things the Japanese animators did wrong or mostly wrong but im not going to do that. However I will say 3 things that are common problems I see in this movie and in 2D anime. 1. There was 1 to many \\"glory\\" shots! Some of the ladies got these slow sexy shots that started at their feet all the way up to their faces. All this while being naked. Males are obviously the target audience here. 2. There were a couple of non-action situations that could've gone better. The Japanese typicaly have some guy (or gal) who is the hardass in custody, soon to be released, or emotionally distant from everyone else who later comes to save the day. Sound familiar anime lovers? 3. Although this film did a much better job of it, most of the characters were very similar in appearance. The women in particular.<br /><br />All that said the movie is kick ass with awesome surround sound, crisp HD picture, and some stunning brutal visuals! Im very happy this movie is in my collection. Im a fan of the Staship Trooper franchise and this is the jolt I have been looking for after the nightmare of the 2nd & 3rd movies.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I play this game on my kindle fire hd. it looks great, plays great and is a lot of fun
B00881VLCE|5.0|it is a great game because they have great puzzles<br />wow it is great so cool I could play it all day.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Totally fun fantasy, adventure, action movie- and perfect for when you just can't watch another romantic comedy....<br /><br />I am NOT a fan of Twilight or Kristen Stewart- AT ALL-  but I have to give it to her in this role, she's actually good.<br /><br />She plays a very realistic 17 year old.  She is awkward, stumbling and completely sincere as any naive 17 year old girl would be.  That is any naive 17 year old who just found out she is the only salvation of an entire country.  I hate to say it, but I was kind of impressed with her.  Even more astonishing is how much range Chris Helmsworth shows in his role as the drunk, angry huntsman- he is great.  The only thing that was off for me initially was Theron's Evil Queen.  I think Charlize Theron is a wonderful actress but her Evil Queen is... strange.  She is oddly overdramatic and just plain weird until.. you realise that in this version of Snow White, the Evil Queen is severely mentally ill, not just evil for evil's sake, then the story makes sense.  (And the dwarves and the enchanted forest - worth the price of the rental- wonderful. :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft. I used the money to but it. But it says there was an error while downloading this app. It says I can install but it won't let me. Is it that I have no space or what please someone help me!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so cool I love it and my lil bro likes it too :) you should buy it woo cool.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|the app worked great until these pop up ads asking to update came in. now no videos will download. I loved this ap before it broke
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is very fun, addictive and challenging. Yet, it can easily be played for very short periods of time. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I honestly haven't seen many games that were so simple, but so awesome at the same time.
B000TNF7NS|4.0|Having been a fan of hard rock for many years, I had only heard of UFO once or twice in passing.  After several mentions on \\"That Metal Show\\" I decided to check them out.  I disagree as often as agree with the hosts on the show, but \\"Strangers in the Night\\" was really a revelation.  It is remarkable that a band of this caliber is almost never played on U.S. radio.  I literally have never even heard one UFO song on the radio in my entire life.  After being blown away by \\"Strangers in the Night\\" I decided to start buying the studio albums and \\"Force It\\" delivers.  I chose this one first as it contains the most \\"Strangers\\" tracks in studio form.  \\"Let It Roll\\" loses something sonically from its live version but still rips and I'm sure was very innovative sounding in 1976.  \\"Shoot Shoot\\" sounds amazing here, just a killer, fun heavy rock song from the 70s.  \\"Out in the Street\\", \\"Mother Mary\\", and \\"This Kid's\\" all are great compositions.  I feel that the former two are topped by the \\"Strangers\\" versions, while the studio \\"This Kid's\\" does more for me. What a killer main riff.  The other four album tracks are also quality, with \\"Love Lost Love\\" being the strongest of the bunch (incredible lead work and good times rock lyrics) and \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" the weakest- (a lot of build up that I don't feel pays off enough).  Another very soild album from this criminally unknown band.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game this is very fun and addicting this is the game I play when I am bored
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is a nice little logic game. Though not on par with such games like Angry Birds or Greedy Spides, it keeps the player entertained. The achievements are a good addition. Graphics and gameplay run decently. All in all a fun little game app.
0345803485|5.0|Absolutely loved the book. I usually can't still long enough to read more than a magazine article.  But I could NOT put this book down.  I'm now on the second one.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Is it humanly possible for an artist to keep on giving and giving.His work keeps graduating,his stories keep telling,and vocals and words are so far ahead of the rest of the pack. You dont only sing and tap your foot when you listen to tempest you feel the deep emotion from Dylan easily passing through us all.Keep up this unreachable work Bob, Like a bottle of fine wine.
B005FISBV2|5.0|It is a interesting show. It always keeps your mind working trying to solve the crimes. Teaches you how awful some crimes really are and how some minds are so twisted. Great purchase
B007DIQC90|5.0|Heard Little Talks enough times on the radio that I was tired of it, but at the same time still interested in what else the band had to offer. Really enjoyed this album more than I expected.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a little sluggish at times: but if you enjoy playing spider solitaire,  you might want to check this game out.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I wanted a small flash for my D3100 and this one is just perfect.  I already have two sb-600's and one sb-900 that I use with my D80 for studio work.  I wanted a smaller flash for my little D3100 that could just sit on top of the camera and bounce off the ceiling or a white card.  The sb-400 is perfect for that!  It's small size complements the small size of the D3100 and it doesn't look awkward sitting on top of the camera.  I just turn on the flash and I can control the output from my camera's menu when my camera is in manual mode.  I only shoot in manual mode so I cannot write anything about any of the automatic settings.  This flash can light up a decent size room and I have had no trouble with it at all.  It also comes with a cute little zippered case.  If you've been thinking about getting this flash, do yourself a favor and get it  :)
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is the best game ever I mean I loved it to death make more games miniclip.com<br />p.s. its kind of like the only game I play
B0087HT36U|4.0|Very fun, lots of levels and variation.  A good option for entertaining the kids too.  Lots of achievements to unlock too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app useful features does what it says it does would recommend, helps monitor battery usage glad I found it
B0094K1PW4|1.0|Preposterous plot. Characters with no depth. Bad SFX. Gawd awful. No worth the time I spent watching it. Save your money.
1476712042|5.0|I received this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Oh My Gosh! This book is definitely one of my absolute favorite books ever! I loved everything about \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" so much - the characters, the plot, the setting, the whole story! I would absolutely love it if \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" was turned into a movie; I know it would become a Hollywood bestseller! I found myself wanting to be in the book with these characters. I actually felt myself get involved with them. I read this book in a matter of one day in a couple sittings, so all together it was really only a matter of hours. I would give this book easily 5 STARS! Jamie McGuire, formerly a self-published author, definitely deserves her new spot with Simon and Schuster - Atria Books. Congrats Ms. McGuire! You earned it!<br /><br />I LOVED LOVED LOVED the characters in this Contemporary Romance novel! Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox and Abby Abernathy were amazing! Travis, a popular tattooed bad boy, is the champion underground fighter at his University. Every girl wants to be with Travis, and every guy wants to be him - except Abby, at least in the beginning. Travis was instantly attracted to Abby because she seemed resistant to his charms, and soon they became best friends. Abby, whom was running from her own troubled past, was so set on the fact that she shouldn't be with a guy like Travis that she kept denying her true feelings for him. Eventually, the truth came out and Travis and Abby became romantically involved. Travis' behavior made a complete 180 and everyone from their college was just waiting for him to treat Abby like he used to treat girls. But, Travis was so head over heels in love with Abby, he stayed faithful to her. Of course, like with every relationship, they had their share of drama and breakups. But, love conquers all in this story and there was definitely a Happily Ever After in Travis and Abby's cards!<br /><br />I liked the college setting in \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\" Being at the college age myself I enjoyed reading about situations I could relate with. I also love bad boys that are really good and sweet at heart, so I was completely in love with Travis' character. I also could relate somewhat with Abby's character in the sense of wanting to start over and not have everyone know about the past. Everyone in \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" was just amazing. I really appreciated the supporting cast and liked Travis' cousin Shepley, and his girlfriend America (Abby's best friend). Like I said previously, I just wanted to be in this novel with these characters.<br /><br />If you are someone who is looking for an amazing read and likes Romance with the college age group, I strongly suggest Jamie McGuire's \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\" I will definitely read more books by Ms. McGuire; I really liked her writing style. This 5 STAR book will not leave you disappointed; it will leave you aching for more!<br /><br />Brianna Lee Book Reviews<br />[...]\\" Being at the college age myself I enjoyed reading about situations I could relate with.

B00843TZJ2|5.0|I've seen CSN often over the past 40-odd years, and I saw this 3+-hour-long tour last June in Providence.  It's their best show yet, and this self-recorded DVD captures it splendidly.<br /><br />As always, they've worked up enough clever new changes in the arrangements to keep even the most familiar hits sounding fresh.  There's also some relatively UNfamiliar material, all of it great. David and Graham each contribute a terrific new song, evocative of their best work.  Their songs are always ABOUT something.<br /><br />Yes, as some out there have whined, Stephen's voice is not quite what it once was--unlike David and Graham, whose voices just keep getting smoother--but the slight damage is only the kind of weathering that makes a voice MORE emotionally appealing, more poignant, like Billie Holiday's on LADY IN SATIN, and Stephen solidly nails every note, at both the high and low ends of his range.  \\"As I Come Of Age\\" is particularly moving.  And dear God, his guitar-playing this tour is superlative, even by his own standards.  He's gotten his second wind, and it has fanned him into flame.  As Graham says in the interview segment, Stephen always comes to party--but he seems to be having a better than usual time at THIS party.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the interviews with the band and road crew.  I loved, for instance, having a close look at the famous \\"`Wooden Ships' guitar,\\" and getting to know Rance Caldwell, Jerry Fox, Will Nash, Crook Stewart, Ian Ayler, \\"Coach\\" Sexton, Mason Wilkinson, David Wells and the others who make that awesome spectacle look easy.  It is obvious that to a man, they don't just respect CS&N, they love them.  Well they might.  Offhand, I can't think of any other act that has ever thought to give airtime to their road crew and managers on the DVD.<br /><br />And God, it's great to see/hear the three of them romp through the insanely difficult \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" together as effortlessly as if they were still in their twenties!  It's worth remembering that two of them are Sixties Survivors twice over, having survived both THE and THEIR sixties.  Teach your children well: show them this DVD.
0099579936|5.0|This book grabs you right away in the first chapter and doesn't let you go.  It made me want to do nothing else but keep reading the books.  I have now read all 3 and I am in the process of reading them over again, which I have never done.  It was awesome to let myself get swept away into a fantasy like this.  Not your normal everyday love story, better!  It has definitely stirred up my passion and my husband loves that too.  I am sure there will be a big baby boom next year after all of the readers of this book.  It is really what I needed at this point in my life.  I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|The CD was awesome.  I loved the movie so much I had to have the CD. I would recomend this CD for it's content.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|has a lot of games and its very cool to play. pretty awesome and the more coins you get then the more games you play
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book, and i cant wait to read the other two. i love how the movie and the book compare, too.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Purchased this cover to replace one that stood up.  This one looks like a real book, as well as feels like a book cover.  Had no problem with it closing after a couple of days of placing it on its front.  Also while it was a tight fit to put on it has never slipped and does not interfere with the use of any of the touch screen controls.  Am very pleased with this product.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I know I've left essentially the same review elsewhere, but I wish I could have just got a 1-dics blu-ray version. This came with a DVD and a \\"digital copy\\" (which, again, blu-ray is already digital) which are completely unnecessary. And you know what? I gave the versions I don't need to friends. So, movie studios, you potentially lost 2 sales on this.
B008XG1X18|3.0|love the app but it freezes often on my kindle fire which happens daily. other than that the app is great.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|This was a 3-disc combo, plus a digital copy.<br /><br />Disc 1 is the blu-ray. Fantastic, this is what I wanted.<br /><br />Disc 2 is \\"special features\\". Why this didn't just fit on the blu-ray disc is beyond me. Mind you I haven't watched them yet so maybe there's way too much on there. Meh. I don't really need this.<br /><br />Disc 3 is a DVD copy. Totally don't want that. It also includes a digital copy of the movie... which is strange because, you know. Blu-ray is also digital. I can make my own digital copy of it if I need to.<br /><br />All-in-all, once again, I enjoyed the movie, and wanted to have all the Avengers movies, so I got this one. I just wish I could've gotten a 1-disc blu-ray version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its awesome and so helpful.  I cant wait to get on each day.  I tell everyone I know to use it..... what more can be said?
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Very happy with this app. Clearly shows WiFi available, Channels that congested, and Signal Strength. Each of the 5 screens of this app are very easily understood once you understand the concept of this app's use. After showing it to my IT friends, they were instant converts from the paid app they were using.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I personally like this more than angry turds. Yes in app purchases are bad and yes the physics leave something to be desired, but the concept is great. I prefer to aim where I am trying to hit. Then it becomes about choosing the appropriate place to hit. I also must agree the fake reviews are horrible and a huge turnoff. Also the levels get repetitive and eventually you will see similar levels and have no problem. I beat the entire game in half a day. Would recommend trying it out for yourself.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I love Malcolm Gladwell.  He writes well, he's funny, challenging, and never pedantic while teaching across many disciplines.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is my favorite of his books so far.  It might have saved me from 2 bad marriages had it been written soon enough!<br /><br />Understanding when to trust your gut instinct or intuition and when to use your logical mind could change your life.  I'll say no more, you have to read without knowing the subject matter.<br /><br />I'm thrilled the library had a long waiting list for this so I ended up buying it!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|If you love alternative, and blues you will love this band.  their soulful style and catchy songs will have you hooked!  i know i am.  i have it on mp3 and vinyl now.  :)
0345803507|5.0|I really enjoyed the complete trilogy of Fifty Shades. I couldn't put it down once I started it. I passed it on to my<br />friends.
0893860468|5.0|I purchased my first copy of I AM THAT in 2005 (since then I have purchased five more as gifts for friends.) Prior to reading I AM THAT much of what I read on non-duality, especially Zen, I found incomprehensible, so I had no great expectations when I began to read I AM THAT. I was wrong. The book was a revelation! Maharaj's explanations concerning awareness, consciousness, the true-Self, self-realization, meditation, and many more philosophical and spiritual concepts, were like a bright light in a dark room. As others have said, he was not only a great sage, but a great teacher.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Used to work perfectly, now I can't download anything. I'd like my money back if it doesn't get fixed. Please update!
B008602KQI|5.0|A few years ago my daughter-in-law loaned me the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy telling me that since I liked science fiction stories I would probably enjoy this series.  Before reading the books however, I discovered they were written to target per-adolencents.  I thought to myself that \\"These wont be my 'cup of tea'.  After several months of their setting on the book shelf and having nothing else to read one night I started on the first volume.  After an hour of reading I became a stary eyed teenaged girl even though in reality I am a 72 year old male. I began a reading marathon in which I read the series during every free moment.  Then I read them all again.<br />  With that preface in mind you can not imagine elation of finding out that they were being made into a series of movies.  Then, to my chagrin, I remembered what the studios had done to some of my other favored Sci-Fi stories such as \\"Time Machine\\", War of the Worlds, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", (Blade Runner) et.al.  Before the release of the film I watched no promos, trailers, talk show interviews.  I wanted to go into the movie with the same frame of mind as I did with the books.  I know too, that there is no way to put the entire book into the film without making it a 6 hour movie so was very apprehensive as to what had to be left out and the treatment of what was included.<br />  Well,  IT WAS AWESOME! The cinematography, casting, acting, character development, everything was perfect.  That is quite a statement coming for someone know for picking out flaws in a film.  I would put it the same class as \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Braveheart\\".
B0058VW36U|1.0|Game keeps looping to the start menu. I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled the app; but it didnt fix the issue.
B0074VTHKM|1.0|Did John get someone from the local high school to write this book.  Really, this book was so weak I am a little shocked.  Let's get back to stories with some meat.
159514188X|5.0|The book 13 Reasons Why was a phenomenal book. Jay Asher kept you on your toes wondering what would happen next. The book 13 Reasons Why is a book that shows that everythting may seem fine and nothing is bothering them, but in actuality something is wrong even if it is just internal. Jay Asher used casette tapes as a reference to figure out why she committed suicide which many authors normally wouldn't do, they would normally have a letter or video of why they killed themselves. Jay Asher went at telling the story of why a different way, instead of the person who actually committed suicide he wrote through the point of view of one of the people who recieves the casette tape which makes the story even more interesting because you go through there reactions, thoughts, and feelings which is why I would absolutely recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|force closes sometimes on kindle fire when I first turn it on but otherwise works great! easy to navigate like the actual website
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Loved The Princess Bride, but felt as if you outgrew it a bit? Well, rush to see Stardust and enjoy this tale to the grateful sound of your grown up mind and childlike heart. Familiar actors take on unexpected roles and the story of love conquering all takes center stage with profound quotables and comedy you'll retain long after the film ends.<br /><br />Own Stardust and you won't be disappointed!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am used to knowing what is going to come in a book and this one kept me on my toes. Cute story line, kept me entertained on my cross country flight.
B0087HT36U|3.0|But it hangs or force closes every couple of levels.  If it weren't for that, I'd rate it much higher.<br />True, it's very similar to Angry Birds even if it is somewhat easier.<br />Motorola Photon 4g
B008XG1X18|5.0|great!! I use this app daily!  I like being able to edit boards and reorganize pins versus other pin apps just allow browsing.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I am a Crichton fan, his ability to inform as well as entertain is what attracted me to his work.  This book turned out to be a disappointment.  The story, while full of potential, comes off as formulaic and stilted.  The characters just don't work.  The dialogue is taken from a Writing 101 course, the romance is forced, and the whiny guy is too stupid and whiny.  I thought to myself, poor Michael Crichton must have been completely out of it when he finished this work. Apparently, I was the only one on the planet who didn't realize Crichton laid the foundation for the book but did not write most of it.  Once I learned that fact it all made sense.  Stay away from this work, I believe if Michael Crichton had known how this book was going to turn out he would have asked that his name be removed from the project.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Didn't get a chance to see the movie but the book is definitely worth the price. One note of caution though, when it was delivered to my Kindle it was sent to the archive folder.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Does not work,  crashes as soon as I run it.  Will not launch on my jelly bean running galaxy nexus.  Going to uninstall it now.
0307887898|5.0|Lean Startup discusses macro level strategies to improve the likelihood of viability of new products and services. Moving away from the more rigid academic approaches that are largely finance oriented, Ries takes a market oriented approach and demonstrates with numerous examples how flexibility and testing based on data are key to determining real not \\"believed\\" market needs and the extent to which those needs are commercializable. Reis also recognizes that his approach is for the early part of a product/company life cycle and that, once established, product redevelopment should follow a similar path in the face of market competition.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was expecting an average-quality book, based off what my friends have told me about it. But \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is an engaging book, exciting and interesting. What I love most about it is the playful dynamic between Christian and Ana. Can't stop reading it!
0812993292|5.0|It is a very human story of great compassion and imagination.<br /><br />It greatly  lightened my week.  Honest and moving.  I could not put it down.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is a great book! everyone wants to know what happens when the greeks and romans get together. i wont say anything but it wasnt what i expected at all. and the ending is such a cliffhanger, i just dont wanna wait anothr year for the next one. rick if u read this plz write faster. lets hope for 600+ pages! u gotta read this book im tellin ya
B0087HT36U|4.0|this game was fun and frustrating at the same time. some levels were easier than others but over all a very enjoyable game.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I loved the melodies, you can make your on music by mixing the sounds. very soothing and relaxing, I instantly start to relax.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the narrator and the easy to follow verses. It is a good app for when you're are the go.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its great on the computer but its so much easier to do in bed on my kindle. I find so many things I want but cant afford and great ideas for the future. I do wish the everything catagorie was longer.
B004T4F7TW|5.0|This is a great album and a joy to listen to.  Hugh clearly shows that acting was his day job, music is his love.  I purchased the Imported Vinyl version of this album.  The album is VERY well pressed and sounds amazing, not shocking as Hugh seems to be a fan of vinyl.  Nearly dead silent with zero pops and hiss.  the dynamics of the album are fantastic and it's very well mixed.  The piano soars in St. James Inf while the guitar (played with a slide) is layered in to add some wonderful depth.<br /><br />My personal highlights of the album:<br />-St James Infirmary<br />-Battle of Jerico<br />-Swanee River (by far my favorite on the album)<br />-John Henry<br />-Tipitina<br />-Let Them Talk<br /><br />I truly hope that Hugh keeps on recording.  I love to see the revival of these songs. I love to see Hugh getting them out there to a whole new audience
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app was cool for downloading any videos i want until I started to download some them as mp3. those made me unable to even preview the videos to see if its good to download because it keep on saying check the video quantity. this also made me from excitement to disappointment. This problem might be because your violating the federal copyright law of copying people videos from the site.
B004UID2LC|1.0|After I had a total of 70+ songs, it started to stop downloading songs. Waste of time, you've been warned!
0553801473|5.0|this book leads you through the futher adventurs of the carectures you first meet in king of thrones. I hope this will not be the last ,there were too many unansered questions and featsn of the main carectures.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so minecraft pocket edition is evolving but i think that they should add armor so you can withstand the attacks.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|At first I wasn't sure how this book was going to work. As I started the book I was still not sure, but the further and further I read the more hooked I became. The way the book intertwined the main story with various running history and the personal stories of the people in the book is brilliant. Who woulda thunk a book about running could be so addicting to read?
0439023491|5.0|Excellent sequel to the Hunger Games.  Couldn't put it down, the book drew me in and I read it in 1 one day!  Was very pleased with the twists and turns in the plot.  Katniss really held true to form.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Leaves you in a sweat. Bloody,shocking at the cruelty of people upon others and how casual the leaders<br />of terrorist groups display '0' feelings. It's easy to cheer on the Seals.
159562015X|5.0|After a quick online quiz, you get your top 5 strengths. From there, you read those sections of the book to learn more about those areas and how to maximize them in your life. It was very interesting.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game for all that makes you think. if you like brain training type puzzles or need something to pass the time this is perfect.
B00275EGWY|4.0|I am also a veteran but with no first hand combat experience, I worked on F-14's, but don't see me getting my panties in a bunch over Top Gun[[ASIN:0671618245 Top Gun]]  (ok not the same type of movie) but as others have pointed out, that it is meant to entertain, I have spoken to other veterans that say while there are a lot of liberties are taken, many feel the overall tension/mood of the film does offer something that many other war movies have not been able to portray, and I think they manage to not make it political and move it to a personal level. The acting is outstanding and the setting in Jordan only miles from the Iraq border adds to the gritty feel.  Something the filmmakers did (spoiler alert) is to kill off the faces you recognize and let then little known actors take the lead that added to the tension that at any moment any character could die.
0671027344|3.0|This book to me seems moderately interesting and moderately well written. It would probably appeal more to much younger readers than I, which may help explain why I wasn't especially moved by it. I read it because a woman, perhaps in her late 20's, had been reading it and described its content to me in general terms, and seemed quite enthusiastic about it. So I thought that by reading it I'd get more insight about her generation's interests.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a glimpse into the imennse sacrifice and dedication the many men and women give so that we can live in a free country.The book itself is riveting and can't be put down until the story is told. The underlying story is much more complicated. Mark Owen and ALL!!! who wear the uniform are to be respected and appreciated. Thanks to Mark for telling the story as it happened and not through the filter of the suits. God Bless America
B003K16P50|4.0|Cloistered fish loving nut meets politics and love while pursuing his dream.  A quick engaging read even if it is fantastical.
B00881VLCE|5.0|As a puzzle lover and being new to my kindle I found this app and I've been putting puzzles together oj here ever since. It has all the convienience of having multiple puzzles at you're finger tips without needing a clear and big enough space. Also no clean up! And I can put them together time and time again without losing any pieces.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great way to pass the time.  Keeps me comming back to play and doesn't hound you to buy thing's.<br />Good product
B0068THAGY|5.0|I would call it a naive monster movie. an introduction movie to the genera great for young teens. i wish i could have seen it in theaters. i think we need more movies like that.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wanna see what happens when men step up to be great fathers, husbands and friends?  Here you go.  The movie \\"Courageous\\" is a rarity in that it doesn't just entertain with faith inspired outcomes, it identifies by example the tools and skills needed for an average man to become a great man.  Courage, Integrity and Accountability are all features of honor and dishonor in this movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to not just men, but families looking to improve or measure the depth of their relationships with one another.  \\"Courageous\\" does honor to what it means to be a loving parent and spouse with faith as your family foundation.  Learn how to measure the true success of a man. For it is the love and respect of those closest to him that make him great.<br />5+ stars
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It was an enjoyable read.  Not the tension I normally expect in a Reacher book.<br /><br />I just kept thinking of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.  How a 5'6\\" pretty boy is going to play Jack Reacher who is not pretty, stands 6'5\\" and has a 50\\" chest, I can't imagine, unless the rest of the cast are Lilliputians.  Very disappointing casting and I will take a pass on the movie so that I might continue to enjoy the books.  Maybe Mr Child lost an election bet or was in financial trouble...maybe Mr Child belongs to Mr Cruise's church and it's a tithing thing.
B00633W614|3.0|A formula book that collapsed on itself half through as though the author ran out of ideas but managed to continue the momentum like a rock rolling downhill  He was probably given a healthy advance by the publisher. Its somewhat like this review, when I find I need to tell readers I purchased the book from Amazon and it needs product links and and and. So my work is being managed and it loses something.<br />However Strunk and White would have been proud of this author which is more than should be said about most.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the website and I love the app! It's easy to navigate and I can repin right from the app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|awesome app. fun to use and I love to read the jokes and look at animal pics. get it its a must have
B0087HT36U|1.0|Wouldn't get past the miniclip splash screen. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, rebooting phone, etc. Looks like a fun game. Will change my rating if they fix the issue. LG G2X
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is totally worth it. minecraft has finally came out on kf and has all the features doesn't need wifi and is super clear. you should definetly buy this!!!!!!!
B0087HT36U|3.0|I really like the theme of the game, but it runs somewhat slow and there seems to no precision shekel aiming your shots.  A tap in a small radius will yield the same target.  This takes a good deal of the fun element out of the picture!  Fix that and it would get a rating boost!
B0054SMID0|4.0|I was really surprised at the performances in this movie. MCconohey was good in this movie. He did not try to force the character  and seemed very natural. It was good to see Marisa Tomei and William H. Macy on screen again. Their performances were very good also. I don't remember hearing much about this film when it came out. I'm glad to rediscover this hidden gem on Amazon Prime.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo mail is my favorite but it still leaves much to be desired in speed, in accuracy and in customer contact ability.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|When the characters weren't busy whispering or mumbling (for dramatic effect I imagine, but failed miserably by just being annoying), they were simply showing poor acting skills (not what I would have expected from this ensemble). The movie dragged and left me wishing they would just get to the end already. A good premise that was poorly executed.
B008VBYN80|4.0|still too gems based, but that's just the times.its definitely got lots of fun twists. I like it pretty well.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are awesome!  I bought the movie outright without ever having seen it before because these two are a great comedic pair.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend recommended this book since I have 3 dogs.<br />It was all my friend said it would be.<br />An endearing story about a family's life, the ups and downs, told by the ever faithful dog!<br />It was in the Kindle format which in my book makes it even more enjoyable!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Very surprised by how good this turned out.  I had low expectations, but they pulled it off brilliantly!  I enjoyed the re-telling of the classic fairytale.  Great effects, and good music!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app to easily navigate pinterest on kindle. best pinterest app I have found so far. you should try it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm so glad this is finally on the amazon app store. I have been waiting so long for this game to be on my Kindle Fire.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I won't repeat what others have written - nice concept, good sound isolation.<br />Software (v8.35.18) is terrible - very unstable, numerous crashes of different types. Message boards full of similar complaints.<br /><br />Now I am using the headset without special features, without surround sound, with standard Windows drivers.  That is a disappointment.<br /><br />Hopefully they will eventually fix the s/w.
0345803485|1.0|What a waste of $10. Harlequin Romances' cost less and at least most of them have an interesting plot-the sex is also more believable and they use adult language.
144471032X|5.0|I read the book and started the diet exactly 2 weeks ago.  I did the attack phase for 7 days and lost 7 lbs. Then I went on the cruise phase but did not alternate the  pure protein days but stayed on the veggies and protein every day.  But I lost another 5 lbs.anyway.  I only have 3 or 4 lbs. additional lbs to lose so I am just going to continue this.  I do walk 4 miles everyday too.  What I have most learned from this diet, is that whole grains do not agree with me, especially wheat.  My daily digestive problems (inflammation, pain gas, etc (IBS) have improved by 99% in one week.  When I researched this wonderful and unexpected additional benefit I discovered tons of information on how supposedly healthy whole grains, and in particular wheat, cause a plethora of problems with your health.  Who knew?  Why we are more fat today many sources report is from eating highly engineered wheat products since the whole grains push in the mid  80's.  Close to Dr. Dukan 's philosophy is another book I recommend written by a cardiologist.  It's called.  \\"Wheat Belly\\".  A silly name for a very serious book.  I am not suggesting one abandon the Dukan diet but i do recommend you read this book too.  You will simply be amazed what this new version of whole grain wheat does to your brain and body.<br /><br />But back to Dukan.  I am never hungry on my version of the cruise phase, I have no food cravings (and this from a hopefully former food addict).  Best of all I have so much energy and rarely feel depressed at all.  Dare i say I am really happy most days.  I feel like this has changed my life and outlook much for the better.<br /><br />I think Dr. Dukan should enhance his book with more information on this topic.  I am not saying I will never eat another piece of pizza or bread again, but much much less of those  things than I used to. It may not be following the food pyramid guidelines but, heck, I have never felt better my life.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I was so exited to see that mpe came to the kindle fire, I couldn't resist buying it! It's great for a portable game, but not as good as the pc version. There aren't as many blocks in it as the pc version, and I really don't like the height and map limits. I would recommend this as a good way to play minecraft on the go.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This cd is a breath of fresh air in an industry that seems to be intent on promoting style over substance. Frank Ocean's debut is worthy of all the advance hype it received. The man has the soul of a poet and an introspective genius rarely seen in music these days. I refuse to classify him as strictly an R&B artist. His music spans genre's and in many ways could even be classified as a hybrid of R&B, Neo-soul, and Rock. I hope he remains true to himself and doesn't allow the industry to try to force him into a mass-market niche that would undermine his credibility.
0446547646|3.0|I am giving this 3 stars for 3 reasons...<br />1. Loyalty to a long time favorite writer<br />2. he really does have a way of writing very descriptive/intresting characters and places<br />3. had I known if it was a \\"nights in rodanthe\\" ending..or a \\"safe haven\\" ending I would have skipped this book and not been disappointed.<br />I won't go into the plot because it's already been written by other reviewers but let me just say that this book has every cliche imaginable.*mini spoiler* boy from wrong side of tracks, rich girl, separated by parents that dont understand..boy waits for girl,  love rekindled years later, girl doesnt want to split up family...I assumed that Mr. sparks would twist cliches and make magic out of them like he's been known to do. let's just say that did not happen. I will say that my personal preference in these types of books is to have a happy ending and I was quite disappointed when this one did not.  If that is not a requirement for you, you may love this book. I wish there was a way to know ahead of time since it can be hit or miss with the happy endings in his books.**spoiler alert** I was quite disappointed when Mr. sparks made me fall in love with these characters and  GAVE hope that their love would actually survive, only to find out that Dawson died in the end. When amanda' s husband was in an accident with her son I knew it would be predictable for her husband to die so that she and dawson could be together and I didn't want it to go that route; but I thought that would be the last straw she needed to leave him, since it was his fault he was so drunk he had to have his son come get him in the first place. Then the last and final cliche that her son got Dawsons heart as a transplant made me angry. It made you think the whole book was meaningless. There were hints here and there that Amanda just needed time and he just had to wait for her, and the author left the door open for her to leave.. with two of her kids being older and leavinghome soon..and her admitting she would never love her husband the way she loved Dawson....she even had her moms blessing! So now what is she supposed to do?? Live the rest of her life blaming a husband she will never love enough and living with regret? I don't understand...I know there is often\\"meaning\\" and lessons learned in books and that life isn't always a happy ending but thats the real world..not the books I read to escape the real world for a brief moment. I don't know what it was about this book, I actually liked \\"a walk to remember\\" and\\" message in a bottle\\" without the happy ending...but there was just something about this book where I knew what was coming and I really didn't want to finish it. I think it was the fact that you fell so in love with these characters and you really cared about them coupled with the fact that the author gave you so much HOPE!<br />**ps..was anyone else so glad that this book wasnt filled with singing \\"cicadas\\"? Omg..I didn't read his books in order but I remember that there were like 4 books I read in a row were the cicadas sang or chirped or whatever every five minutes! So glad he got the hint lol..
0525953728|5.0|The author of this book writing under an anonymous name authored this novel about the capture and assassination of Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was the terror master who was the mastermind behind the killing of 3,000 American citizens. He had been the subject of a massive manhunt ever since the acts of terror had taken place. The author was a member of the team that eventually dealt with bin Laden. The author of this novel was a member of Naval Special Warfare Development Group. He advanced to Seal Team 5 and finally became a member of Seal Team 6. Seal Team 6 gained fame by rescuing Richard Phillips the<br />Captain of the Maersh Alabama. This ship had been captured by Somali pirates. Because of service like this he was selected for the Osama bin Laden mission.<br />This book gives you details about the training this team went through to go on this mission. When the mission is launched not all goes well. The helicopter carrying some team members crashes. There is a gunfight before they finally get bin Laden. This is a very good book. Be sure to read it.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|it was great untill I needed the newest upgrade but when I went to the app it didn't say &quot;upgrade &quot; so now it won't  let me play or download videos so it was a great app untill they jacked it up :-(
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I loved this app. it was the best app in the store, until the app says it needs to update, when. there is no update.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|The movie opened with an absolutely stunning, establishing shot, taking us over mountains and forests; down into a remote village...........where we landed with a sad little thud.<br />We were hardly in that village a few minutes when things began to go awry.  Obviously, like a lot of movies, they blew their entire budget on art direction and the casting of Julie Christie (as elegant as ever), and that canned ham Gary Oldman.  Whatever was leftover was sparsely spread among lesser considerations.<br />This movie stopped working the moment the dialog started.  Scenes were abrupt, founding explanations were blurted in random fashion; emotions were either muted or overblown, not matching the sequences.  Everything felt out of sync and curiously detached from what they were trying to present.  It didn't help that the lead character Valerie (Amanda Seyfried), came across as a Changeling, someone not indicative of that village, that time period, the known universe.  For the longest time she was the odd one out, until the evil whatsit (Gary Oldman) showed up, stealing the position of the village anomaly.  His abbreviated pomp entrance and that bloviated speech about the difference between a wolf and a werewolf felt forced and out of place (he managed to produce a performance that was both overdone and half-baked; no small feat!).  And as it happened, he brought along the perfect visual aid to demonstrate just what went wrong with this movie.  He made a grand show of introducing a giant doodad in a box that was almost instantly dismissed.  Why impose an elaborate prop into a scene when the simple explanation that went with it was dispensed quickly, making the need for this ornate apparatus irrelevant and redundant.  This was the problem throughout; things didn't really mesh, just a lot of stray pieces slapped together and called a movie.  It was like watching all these cogs spinning recklessly, trying to gain purchase, but the opposing gaps wouldn't accept their teeth.  Everything was at cross-purposes.  In the end, while this movie was certainly lovely to behold, it was ultimately vacuous and not a little silly (I'm almost certain dirty dancing wasn't done in that century).rything was at cross-purposes.  In the end, while this movie was certainly lovely to behold, it was ultimately vacuous and not a little silly (I'm almost certain dirty dancing wasn't done in that century).
B0087HT36U|3.0|This is a very simple but fun game. However at Age of Discovery, 2nd level, after killing all the natives, it does not go to the next level, it just sits there doing nothing. There's no way to go to the next level! This is a fatal flaw. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars. The other complaint I have is it takes too long for the game to recognize the level is over and it takes too long to throw the first stone when the next level starts.
B003EY62II|5.0|My kids loved it. I did too. It was a very active movie, but I thought that my kids would get scared--they didn't! It had a lot of make believe magic and Scooby Doo looked really real. Everyone was like the character that they play in the animated movies.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I really loved this app. Could get all of my gospel songs for the choir. Now I can no longer get any downloads and Amazon  would not help and they tell me they do not have the most recent updates. Too bad.
B0083H6AQA|4.0|Loved it.  One must watch Rob's facial and beautiful eye expressions to see just how good he is.  Story line is a little lacking but getting to look at Rob is worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I got this app just because I had a Pinterest account connected to Facebook.  Little did I know it would become so freaking addicting!  :D I know my way around the app better than the desktop site.  Five out of five.  It's super easy to navigate, and really really convenient.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I went into this movie thinking it would be a cute romantic comedy. wrong. It was disgusting and extremely crude. I saw this in theaters with friends and if I had driven to the movie myself I would have left the theater and not even watched the rest. I would not recommenced this to anyone. ever.
0345472322|5.0|I recently heard of this book during a meeting at work. It sounded like the book had some useful things to say and I decided to give it a shot - since I realize that most of us can use help when it comes to understanding ourselves better. The book was as much a page turner as it was skillful at making one take pause and think about what was being said.<br /><br />It has helped me understand myself better and realize my failures as well as understand my successes. More than anything else it opens up the possibility for any person to not just become aware of their true potential - of which we each have an innate sense - but to come upon a practical path, which leads, through one's own efforts, to the realization of one's greater potential.
B0085YNML2|5.0|the only complaint I have is that there aren't enough levels for me. I sure hope the makers add more soon. overall it is a very cute and challenging game. I still haven't figured out a couple of levels. yet. It is one step below cut the rope.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so happy to have a pinterest app for Android. everything works great!  I really am enjoying the interface. It is very easy to navigate the main page &amp; boards and pinning is a snap!
B004VMVTNU|2.0|not worth the money. one size for display and its much too small. this app. would get one star over at Apple and would cost .99 cents.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I thought this was a very cute movie. It covered a nice range of possible experiences. Obviously it couldn't cover every experience in every way, but it seemed to cover the most common ones, and managed to do it in a very funny, cute, entertaining way.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Just as expected, Kathy Reichs delivers with Bones are Forever.  Same great style that keeps you reading.  Good \\"cliff hangers\\" at the end of each chapter that force you to keep reading.  Wonderful characters who add so much to the story - can practically see the \\"skeeters\\".  Humour that detracts from an otherwise gruesome subject.  Best of all, the old Ryan and Tempe relationship seems to be resurfacing.  As always Reichs informs, educates and entertains.  I will continue to be a fan.  If there is one criticism from me it is that Reichs ends each of her stories in the same fashion. Tempe, going rogue, on her own, being saved in the nick of time (hopefully not a spoiler).  Try something new please Kathy.
0345803485|3.0|I was not impressed. I bought it to see what the big deal was all about.. never found out. Its all hype.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|could not put it down loved it cant wait for next one.lots of hidden objects. and great mysterys just great
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is a good one, I have tried many games for android and they could not keep me interested.  This one is fun with a funny story to make it a great game for me and my son(4).
B008XG1X18|4.0|has trouble loading occasionally, but overall good. I enjoy pinterest and am very excited to use it on my kindle fire
B004UID2LC|1.0|ive been trying to download songs for months now and it wont even search for the song i want!!  this is so annoying and i suggest u fix this soon or noone will download this app...im deleteing this from my divice
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game becomes addicting very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised after I downloaded. I especially appreciated the tutorial at the beginning of the game.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|first off i love the way the disc and the case was delivered no blemishes or defects the people at amazon really take care of the customers secondly the movie Ghost is a 90s classic about supernatural love his death and the fact love goes beyond life itself is amazing and the part where he and Demi Moore are in the pottery set it was and still is the best scene in the movie and Whoppi Goldberg as a supporting actress gave a great flare and spice if the people hate Ghost than they got problems Ghost is about loving someone even in the afterlife and the willingness to not step into the light until the loved ones are taken care of with respect and honor to all bye.
B002YOKVU4|2.0|An insult to intelligence and not even funny...boring and at the same time, disturbing...it's a shame Johnny Depp took this role?? Or not??
034580404X|5.0|This story was \\"awesome\\". There were items and situations that I never knew exited. The characters were very colorful. I so enjoyed these books so much, that I've read it twice. Its like you 're at the movies...so intense...mmm, wow!!!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I never got into any of the other \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" movies and really only got this for a quick look before giving it to a friend but I actually watched this from start to finish and enjoyed it.<br />I have no idea if this is set to be like a prequel for the other movies or a start to another series of new movies but either way this movie explains the 'When, Where, Why and How\\" in a very good way including why the apes end up being so 'Anti-Human' in the previous older movies as well as for setting a scene for any upcoming movies.<br />After watching this movie I'd be happy to watch any upcoming movies if they are done in this movies example.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|Another fabulous book from Philippa Gregory. Interesting, yet insightful account from another great woman from history. Recommend if you have loved all previous \\"queen\\" novels.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|What can I say? The game was already 'Angry Birds' and a cheapskate like me enjoyed it as a free app, even with the ad banners getting in the way of my aiming. But then the ad free app was offered at no cost.  Cheapskate heaven!
0525953728|5.0|I give this book only 5 stars because that is the maximum allowed but truly I give it an infinite amount of stars as I was deeply touched by the gripping story. It is a story that needs to be told, and the author did an excellent job, simply excellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Time sure flies when I play this game! Ads are a little annoying, but easily dismissed. If you like Solitaire, this is the app for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the fact that the story was told completely from Katniss' point of view.  It made the story a very personal one.  While the ending became fairly predictable I did compel me to read the next two books.  In total the trilogy was an easy, entertaining read.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I was skeptical at first, because I was NOT a Darcy fan, but after reading the first few pages, I fell in love with the story.  I loved it more with each page turned.  It is a great novel...it shows that people can change.  The ending was wonderful, much better than Something Borrowed.  I recommend this read for those who enjoyed Something Borrowed.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am sure that anyone looking into the show, is doing so because of word of mouth. You heard really great things about the show and wondered if it was as good as you were told. It is. Enjoy. But save your self some time and just order Season 2 now. If you don't have it in your scratchy little palms in the last seconds of the last episode of season 1..... you will be sorry.  ;)
B008DVJO8C|4.0|Having listened to, and enjoyed all of ITM's albums I quickly grabbed this once it came out. From the opener \\"Rise With Me\\" you get the feeling of a stage being set for a release of energy, the whisper before the scream if you will.<br /><br />Blood, the title track, jumps up and startles you with a dark view of a relationship gone wrong, with expectations not met.<br /><br />Adrenalize and Whore shock you with both demanding and submissive physical desire. Listening to the songs you almost have to consider them companion pieces.<br /><br />The verses in It Is Written is a calm explaination of the hate unleashed in the chorus.<br /><br />Burn is painful in it's sorrow and lovely in the statement of rebirth, with the focus being the ressurection and new life rather than dwelling on the past, regardless of the pain.<br /><br />On and on, this is an album that realizes the pain of life but doesn't wallow in it, rather looks for something more beyond that experience.<br /><br />The entire album seems to say \\"Remember the pain and rise up, above it, and live and be alive!!!\\"
B0087HT36U|5.0|Keep the updates coming<br />Great game with good graphics and tons of replay value with achievements and tons of levels
B004HW7JH4|2.0|I WAS a HUGE Mad Men fan and I own Seasons 1-4 on DVD.  Season 5 is HORRIBLE! Every episode is depressing and has something to do with death or unhappiness. A majority of Season 5 focused on the now seriously balding, extremely depressed Pete Campbell and the extremely depressed Lane Pryce. Didn't need to see Sally in the bathroom.  Boring, depressing, uninteresting. I really wanted to give it 1 star but I like the costumes and Roger Sterling.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|It's the Bee Gees! what more needs to be said... you like them and their music or you don't. that very unique falsetto sound that can not often be found or duplicated.
1582701709|4.0|I can understand how some people could give this book a bad review. Everyone is different and you can either take some things from this book or completely disregard it.<br /><br />I was given this book a while ago and read the first few pages and couldn't get into it and thought it was ridiculous. A few months later, my depression I have been suffering from for a while got really bad, and I just didn't know what to do with myself. Out of desperation I came across the book again and gave it another shot. It actually HELPED me.<br /><br />Depression makes you focus on negatives, only thinking about the bad in your life. This book tells you that you basically need to change your thoughts to positive thoughts. Thinking positively and just THINKING happiness can help you. This strategy is kind of similar to cognitive behavioral therapy, trying to change your thoughts from negative to positive.<br /><br />Not saying that everything in this book is believable, but of you're at a desperate point in your life it could just be what you need to get you started on feeling good and being positive.
0345803485|1.0|Vile trash!  How did this dreadful rubbish get published? Life is too short! Don't waste your time or your money!
B0087HT36U|3.0|Much better than the reviews I read.  Runs great on my HTC tablet.  It's like the castle tumble games you find online. A simple time killer...
B0013K1ALE|4.0|In case of content there are already enough reviews here. So I will focus on the video quality and compare this release with the older one. First of all let me mention that audio is really improved here compared the 1999 disc.<br /><br />VIDEO: Old vs. New<br /><br />To my big disappointment video quality here is not that great. In deed, it is worse than the older release.<br /><br />SHARPNESS:<br />Probably the most important parameter of defining the quality of the video material is its sharpness. 1999 release is sharper than the 2007 one. Analog to digital transfer was done with higher resolution as the Blu-Ray release is definitely sharper than 1999 DVD. This means that it is only a problem of a DVD encoding.<br /><br />COLOR AND BRIGHTNESS:<br />Judging by brightness and color some scenes are better on the old version and others are better on the new version. 2007 version has washed out colors in many scenes. 1999 version has better dark background while 2007 has some haze in some scenes. Overall, it is difficult to give advantage to one over another, in my opinion 1999 is still better most of the time.<br /><br />BLENDING:<br />In 1999 release the film is soft telecined on DVD which means that it contains original 24 progressive frames per second. 2007 release is hard telecined but not via 2:3 pulldown which is common for NTSC DVD. Instead, some frames are blended and the video requires deinterlacing which sacrifices a vertical resolution. So, in addition to the fact that 2007 version is already less sharp compared to 1999 one this blending and deinterlacing downgrades the image more.<br /><br />WHITE BALANCE:<br />White balance has been modified from scene to scene. 2007 release has green tint in many scenes, some frames look blue on 1999 and green on 2007. However, some scenes are in opposite way. I find the older release to have more natural colors but somebody may prefer the newer version.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />The old release has a better video quality, it is sharper and contains progressive frames. The new remastered release is softer and is hard telecined via frame blending. Audio is better on the new one.<br /><br />If you would like to see side by side comparison of screenshots and find out more details about the release you can visit RockDVDReviews
0142000655|5.0|Excerpt from the first page of East of Eden:<br /><br />\\"I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay<br />mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted<br />to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a<br />beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The<br />Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the<br />open sea, and they were dark and brooding -- unfriendly and dangerous. I<br />always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got<br />such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the<br />peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa<br />Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling<br />about the two ranges of mountains.\\"<br /><br />Oh my goodness, who wouldn't want to keep reading?<br /><br />The sheer beauty of the location is conveyed so incredibly well, along with the harsh reality of the less lush and fertile, but still awe inspiring countryside. The first pages absolutely captivated me, I don't know that I have ever read such beautiful descriptions of a place. I'll be honest, sometimes lengthy descriptive writing bores me a tad, I want plot, a story, I want to know what is going on with the people in a book. Oh, I like vivid descriptions, especially vivid descriptions of something magnificent as much as the next person . . . but don't make those descriptions take pages and pages please.  Not so with East Of Eden, I could read John Steinbeck's representation of the Salina's Valley all day long.<br /><br />I don't think there are many coincidences in East of Eden, there seems to be symbolism everywhere, that goes beyond all the C and A names and boys giving unappreciated gifts to their father. I wonder if there is something symbolic in the description of the eastern Gabilan Mountains seeming to be warm and representing the love of a mother, I wonder if they represent Lee the Chinese-American servant and if the dark and dangerous Santa Lucia mountains of the west represent Cathy? This is a book I could read over just to try and find nuances that I am sure are there but I have missed. It is that kind of book, you know you are missing stuff. Well, I'm at least sure that I am missing stuff! That isn't a criticism, it is praise. I think I could dig my teeth into this book again, albeit for different reasons the second time around. I rarely read books again, unless years and years have passed.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I read this book in one and a half day then onto the second one and 3rd read all books within less than a week.. the book was soooo much better than the movie so if you liked the movie which i did you will absolutely love the book!
B008CP92ZO|2.0|This movie started out good but somewhere in the middle it just lost steam and got boring.  They tried to wrap in a flimsy plot but it just fell flat.  I dont even think it was really all that crude or vulgar just not funny.  I do not recommend it, the trailer has all the good parts in it.  I wish i could get a time refund.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I first watched this when I was younger and it first came out. I suppose I didn't understand the message at the time, and watching it again, I realize it is a great movie. Edward Norton plays the best role he's ever played (in my opinion), and I feel like most people who love it or hate it do so for the wrong reasons. Some people love it if they are bigots and they think that this movie is justifying and glorifying their hatred. Some people hate it because they also believe that. However, the message of the movie is that hate is not inherent, it is learned, and it can be un-learned. Highly recommend this film!
0345803493|4.0|The book ended right where the first one left off.  I am looking forward to the third book.  I am hoping for a good ending to the trilogy.
B00866H7SS|3.0|Don't know why this book has been compared to Fifty Shades, perhaps to boost sales. While I still enjoyed it I did find it quite slow and very repetitive. Did not find it to be a very compelling read and am not inspired to read the sequel.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I really enjoyed all the books so far, for me it' s been like I don't want to put the book down. I want to keep going to see what happens next.
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun and exciting challenges are creative and ingenious.  you will laugh till you cry and cry till you dehydrate. get ready for Steven speilbergish fun.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very fun somehow very addictive, on it anytime I am on my kindle and not reading. Would recommend it for anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this game for the xbox. the game is very addicting.I hope they update it very soon.this game rules.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|It has been a long time since I have found a app that was this much fun. I played for many enjoyable hours, it wasnt until I reached level 40 that I lost all my upgrades and gadgets! Very distressed, I started over, had the same thing happen again two hours later! I( definetly recommend this app, just be ready to loase your stuff.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|WOW. I never thought I would like this as much as I did- I NEVER give something 5 stars. Maybe I was just in the right emotional frame of mind, but I stayed up to finish it, not wanting to put it down once I started reading it. I am not one for giving a synopsis of the book because others do it, or you can just check it out for yourself at the top of the page. Let me tell you- this was an emotional roller coaster. I actually could see this happening, and man oh man what a mess it would create. I am not sure that there is not a little co-dependence in this book, but since it is not really a self-destructive sort, I am going to go with it and not take it as a negative. Romance, emotion, a couple teary moments, death and grief- it is the making of a great romance. Colleen Hoover, you have a new fan.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|classic movie.<br />purchaed this one for my grandson after seeing ours at our home.<br />he has played it over and over and over.  and repeat the lines, knows them before they come up.  fast forwards to the parts he loves.<br /><br />delivery fast,<br />packaged well-new<br /><br />thank you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is probably the best book I have ever read. Usually I'm not the type of person who reads a lot, but as soon as I started reading this book I seriously could it put the book down! I was absolutely amazing how Suzanne Collins wrote this book. She made it do you thought your knew what was happening but you really didn't. Hunger Games is a book filled with surprises, danger, adventure, and romance. I love it and I hope you want to read it too
B002BWP49C|5.0|purchaed becuase I love the twilight series.<br />have all the other dvd's knew I needed this one.<br />but haven't even opened it yet.<br />I will though.  soon.<br /><br />fast delivery<br />packaged well-new<br /><br />thank you
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I have always adored Jane Austen's works and this take of Mansfield park is just awesome! I highly recommend it to romance junkies and Jane Austen fans alike.
B004XWLN20|5.0|we watched several of the first seasons of smallville and for whatever reason we started missing episodes.<br />so when it finished=the show, and I saw this, I decided to purchase for my husband as a surprise.<br />GREAT price.<br />beautifully packaged.  new-perfect.<br />he let it set for about a week before opening.  he wasn't sure he wanted to open it.<br />but he did finally start watching them and loves it so so much.<br />received fast.<br /><br />again thank you and sorry for delay in review.<br />great purchase.
B0064W65UM|5.0|Thought provoking. not a walk in the park to read. more like riding a bicycle on a tightrope over a volcano while battling cthulhu. absolutely amazing.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|love the movie, had to have the soundtrack.<br />one I keep in my car.<br />listen to it over and over.<br /><br />packaged well-new unused.<br />sounds just like songs from movie.<br />delivery fast.<br /><br />thanks again
B0087HT36U|1.0|Be advised, this ap would not start on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1.1. It did not provide a very helpful error message. I uninstalled it without bothering to troubleshoot beyond the initial failure. Plenty of other fish in the casual gaming sea.
B008K93302|5.0|I don't know why im doing this i dont even know wat it is. lol i just wanted to be the first one to review lol
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|I'm not one of those people who skip reading the preface.  I study it carefully to determine if the book is even worth reading.  Lots of books that are literary muddles will reveal this in the preface.  After reading only two paragraphs of the preface, I have to say I am hopelessly discouraged for the $13 I recklessly paid for this book.  In paragraph one the authors give their core statement of what this book is about.  They write:  &#34;This book is about the huge differences in incomes and standards of living that seperate the rich countries of fhe world...from the poor.&#34;  Unfortunately, what they wanted to say was that &#34;This book is about why there exists such huge differences in incomes and standards of living between nations.&#34;  If you cant write a coherent core statement of what your book is about, it casts doubt on the entire enterprise.  I can only hope that the rest of the book is better developed
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Cats is the live broadway production and since I can't get to one, I am really glad it's on a DVD.  Really enjoyed watching this DVD/
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Brilliant. I couldn't put this book down. If you ever want to understand what a society is like under a family of megalomaniacs, then read this book!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|ok game for free. easy to play.  good way to kill time.  the only thing I don't like are the controls
B004IQ78HA|5.0|A wonderful timeless telling of Lewis' book.  Appropriate for all ages. The soundtrack contains songs that you can sing 40 years later.  Hee Hee. And share with your children.
B008ZTW7OU|4.0|I first purchased Learn and Burn and loved it.  I then purchased all of their other albums - all of them are good.  This album is no exception.  If you like good classic rock/garage rock, then you will love this album.<br /><br />Side note:  Only true classic albums deserve 5 stars, which are few and far between.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Works well with fire. Pieces are easy to see on all settings. Rotation is good for increasing difficulty. Good range of available pictures.
B00821OUT6|5.0|A great portrayal of a group of freedom fighters vs. aliens, hardened by battle and tempered by a lack of provisions. Not an original concept, by any means, but a well thought out, smart storyline and characters that grow from the John Q. Public type to guerilla freedom fighter to Army Ranger-style warfighter. Way to go Mr. Speilberg.
B008XG1X18|3.0|The layout and functionality are great but it freezes up on the Kindle Fire almost every time and has to be restarted. Hopefully we get a software update soon and can then give it 5 stars.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Why is this version 1.0.0 for $0.99 and there's a newer version 1.0.1 on Google Play for Free?? I don't like these price games developers play.<br /><br />I never really got the angry birds fever. I always liked the original Crush the Castle. Siege Hero makes more sense to me than throwing birds at pigs and the mechanic to launch your stones/bombs/etc is much more accurate. I really like the game and the layout. You also have to protect Peasants so you can't just smash everything. You must think about your target.<br /><br />Cons: The game has a few bugs. I had one case where after blowing up some supports, the structure above did not fall. It was basically floating in air. I restarted the level and it was fine. Another time, when a notification on my phone tried to pop up, the application could not recover. I had to restart it after it force closed.
B0063IH60K|2.0|To many adds each time you start a new hand. This is very annoying playing game on a kindle.You have to exit game to get rid of the add
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept you intrigued and not wanting to put it down.  The story line was well written and kept you interested.  The characters where relatable and interesting.  Would love to see a prequel and a separate story line with Katherine and Elliot.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Much better than Angry Birds....  my opinion tho and we all have them-right?  I have tried to rate games b4 &amp; i type it but then it wont send... so idk if this will or not.... i broke dwn &amp; spent. 99 cents on a virtual game too...
B0087HT36U|5.0|And for those who call it a clone of Angry Birds.. ha!  The flash version of this game _predates_ Angry Birds.  By a lot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|problem downloading on kindle. just shut your kindle down then turn it on and it should down load. Go Irish and Nebraska!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|In order to enjoy this book you have to understand that this book is erotica on paper. This is not the best story-line, so just have fun with it. The second book was very repetitive to me, so I won't buy the third one. Maybe I will re-read the book when I am feeling a little frisky. Lol
0525953728|2.0|this book is a boring rehash of the trainning and boot camp stories that have been written for years - seems like i have read dozens of this story - over and over and over !!
B005LAJ212|5.0|If you missed the full first season then this DVD is just what you need to catch up before the new season starts.  Great price, much cheaper than buying at a discount store and is delivered quickly.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|This is a funny, intelligent, well made piece that combines stereotypes, conincidences and misfortune into an entertaining and worthwhile movie that keeps you laughing.  If you like comedy and horror combos like Shawn of the Dead and Army of Darkness (even though there is nothing supernatural in this movie) you'll love this movie.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|i was happy when i just had it, but it just broke in 2 mins. u had to use it very very careful. cause the quality of the stand is real cheap
B0063IH60K|1.0|An ad would. pop up before each game, which is fine for a free ap. But when video ads starting popping up before each game and wasting my time, I decided to delete it. What a pain in the a55!!!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched the movie first and hadn't heard about the book before that. A few months have passed and I decided to read the book. I want to complete the series before the sequel movie comes out, hopefully next year. I found the book to be much better compared to the movie. I guess its because there are so many finer details you can't capture in the movie and need to edit for time. For example, all the little things going on in Katniss's mind when she volunteers, and while she's at the games trying to survive. Curious to see how the romance shapes up, it just doesn't feel right. I'm just starting the second book, hopefully it will more interesting, at least that's what I hear. Excited to finish the entire series, and then waiting for the movies!
B0087HT36U|5.0|this app is much better than angry birds or other physics games. lucky I got it on the free app of the day
B0002KQNL8|3.0|Nothing will ever top the original return of the living dead, but this part II is fun to watch just for the fun of it.  Like many have said before - the musical score is absolutely terrible in this dvd, but that can be looked over.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this was a very good read. Written better than others like it but did think some parts were a little too similar to 50 shades. I let a friend who hates to read borrow it. She returned it the next day & said she couldn't wait for the 2nd one to come out in October! If you're easily offended, then like 50 Shades you should pass this one up too but if not order it now!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was very skeptical when my wife suggested that we begin to watch this series. I have been extremely impressed with the quality of every actor involved in the series. I believe that it is as well written as it is acted. The plot development as well as the character development gives you something to think about in each episode, and they are masters of being cliffhangers.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie, and I would definitely reccommend it to anyone who loves musicals. I mean who can resist a good old fashioned love story?
B008LZHA3G|2.0|I am the greatest Dylan fan but this is simply great poetry recital. Music is pleasant but unlike Love and Theft it's dull and pointless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting for Minecraft to finally come out on the Kindle Fire. I hope they add more blocks and tools soon! :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful ending to a fabulous trilogy. Kindle version was easy to take with me without feeling tawdry. My husband was continually asking me to put it down. Finished it in 1.5days.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It was working fine but then I updated. it proceeded to keep asking me if I wanted to update to the version that I already had and when I tried to download songs or videos it would say the User information was outdated. Devs should fix this
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a great game but I hate how all of the jetpacks cost and other things... Overall fun game:)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have to say that these games by big fish are wonderful. the puzzels are just hard enough to make you think. the graphics are beautiful. and the story is great too. cant wait for the next addition. for 399 its well worth the price.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This book is very enjoyable to read but some parts get boring and make you want to skim. The  maze runner trilogy is VERY good!! So if you have read those three books (which i definitely reccomend) then i would read this book as well!  All in all, a good read!
B001LF347E|5.0|I was so happy to receive this item. It is a great show with very talented and loving actors/actresses. In this first season of Merlin they will take you on an enchanted journey of a young man getting to know of his destiny. He will find few friends that he can trust with his secrets. His taken under a wing of his new mentor to learn how to control his magic and when/how to use it best. The story is wonderfully acted and flows with much excitement. I believe if you enjoy Medieval or magical elements brought to life in your shows then you should definitely purchase Merlin! Great item, great show, all around one of the best items I have purchased on Amazon.com. Also received in great condition and timely delivery. Arrived in perfect shape, looked brand new like seller said it would. That is all I'm going to tell you about this item so if you wish to know how the entire first season plays out then you will have to get your own copy from Amazon.com! :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun but a little cheesy, so I don't play this game often.  anyway, I recommend this game to people who like quick and easy games.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Could be a good movie without Kristen. She must have slept her way to get the role. It was just a wrong cast. No way in the right mindset would anyone cast her for the role. She cannot act, she does not look innocent, and she is not pure, not pretty like what the storyline describe her. I will never watch a move with her in it again! Charlize is really good in the movie.
B002APU580|5.0|good movie, well produced and accurate time production, well acted  true to the book<br /> costumes were accurate to the time and photography was beautiful.  All of the characters played their roles well and everyone was equal.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book out of peer pressure from my friends. They thought I would love it as much as they did. It would have been okay if it were not so repititious in Ana's thoughts...holy crap and holy shit must have been in the book a thousand times. E.L. James needs to think of other phrases or character traits for these characters. If Christian ran his hand through his hair or held his mouth in a thin, hard line one more time, I was going to vomit!  The world is in bad shape to make this a best-selling book. It is main-stream porn.....that is the draw because it is not good even close to being a good story.
0156030306|5.0|I read it three times, as a twelve-yr-old, then 20, then when I was 53.<br /><br />I was sorry to see that kids my age when they first read it gave it one star and hated it. They were obviously pressed into writing reviews for extra points (which were mainly not anywhere not written well, JAYSUS! can't kids write English anymore!).<br /><br />And it's obvious they didn't discuss it; just had to read it and complain and get extra points for reviews online. Criminy, what happened to English classes and essays? Kids don't know how to write anymore, except in UR thnxs! text.<br /><br />It's a great novel, way ahead of its time, in terms of early science fiction.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Full nudity allowed? Maybe I was misled, but I was under the impression that Pinterest was a safe, family-friendly app. Definitely wrong on that one. What people can do under the guise of &quot;art&quot; is straight-up ungodly. Deleting now.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie as a rental on instant watch. I was expecting a cheesy take on the book that would turn out so-so. But I found the movie very easy to relate to, as I'm 17 weeks pregnant. The movie was funny and some parts brought out a couple tears. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this is a huge rip off of minecraft<br />not cool not cool at all<br />boooo mind blocks<br />rip off rip off
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created a well-rounded, complex world and populated it with fascinating characters. While the plot falls into one of the standard categories ( boy must find and vanquish ancient enemies to avenge his parents), there's nothing trite or hackneyed about the writing. The rich imagery, believable dialogue, and complex narrative structure combine to raise this story well above the norm for fantasy novels. I enjoyed the second reading (after a couple of years) as thoroughly as the first. The volumes of the trilogy should be experienced together in quick succession, comprising a tightly woven whole. If you like the quasi-historical mythology of Charles de Lint, you will feel at home with Patrick Rothfuss.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is really good I use this all the time to see how many hours I have it is cool
B006RXPUR2|5.0|Gone baby gone with Chris aflec and Morgan Freeman, ed Harris can't think of the others right now ...but it was a real thought provoking moral searching movie.  I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.  I would tell all my friends and I did, yo see it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|all the translations. all for free. a great way to inspire the word of God. the reading plans are great as well.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The story, which continues from previous books, seems to be moving far too slow.  Also jumping from area to area is becoming a strain to keep up with.
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|The product does not work propertly.  It is beautiful but if aint work its useless. Wont buy any invicta again online.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Fantastic book!! Absolutely loved it. Have watched the movie now too but definately think the book is better ;-)Great story line and very easy to read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like the assortment of music on this download. I use the soft, relaxing music to assist with getting to sleep when the mind won't quiet. I believe the music would be good for yoga practice however, have not use it yet during yoga. I would recommend this download for anyone seeking good relaxing music. Enjoy.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this one!!! Payphone is my absolute favorite song right now and I play it constantly! Kudos to the guys of Maroon 5 for releasing more great music!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is the color version of the original Cross Me.  It is just as addicting as the original but I find it more difficult that the black and white version. That just makes me play longer!
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Best remaster job I have ever heard! More than a remaster really. The original tapes have been enhanced and the cd sounds as if it were re-recorded today with today's modern technology. It's like listening to a new KISS album. I hope they do all their classics just like this!
B000FBJF3M|4.0|I had to read this book for class. It is an easy fun read. While being wrapped up in the plot I can learn about the Roman aqueducts, the Roman society, and the volcano eruption in Pompeii.
B00846REIS|4.0|I highly suggest this if you liked 50 shades. This book seemed better written though. Looking forward to Oct 2nd for the next book.
B0087HT36U|5.0|angry bird caveman style. Fun and can be a pain in the ass. funny. love the scope feature makes it easer to aim
B001BW02B8|5.0|I just love Maroon 5 so I can't give them anything but the highest mark! I wanted some of their music and am extremely happy with both albums. <3 this one!
B008OOYALE|4.0|My 2 boys love this game on my iPad. They are under 10 and seem to play it well. I would recommend this.
B0086700CM|5.0|Simply put--great fun.<br />Well worth the download &amp; quite suited for Kindle.  Smooth action and progressive game play for players of all ages.  Highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great complexity, strong variety, subtle music, and fun mechanics. make for an excellent game and will inspire me to purchase their other applications
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my 13 year grandson, at his request.  It is adventurous but not villant, we actually had a night when we all watched an episode.  I will add more seasons to his collection.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! I use it all the time! With my husbands job thid app really helps out! -
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is a worthy sequel to \\"The Name of the Wind\\", both of which are set in a fascinating and beautifully-realized world. Elements of fantasy are dealt with realistically, so that 'magic' is treated very much like engineering or science. This leads to believable characters, believable obstacles, and believable story action. A great read.
B006H5120E|4.0|Titanic is a great movie.  The 3D format you can not view unless you have a blueray 3D player and a 3D tv. I have other 3D movies, but you can view them on a hi def tv you don't have to have a special 3D blueray player and tv. I got this movie because we seen it in 3D at the movies thought it would be cool to see it in our house in 3D. It tells you you need the special Player and Tv in very small print on the back of the cover. if it had been in bigger print on the front I would of never got it. I am happy it is on blueray, but the 3D should be able to see on a reg blueray player with 3D glasses, you should not have to have a 3D player and 3D TV. Yes I have some of the old type 3D movies, but I don't have the blue and red 3D glasses I have some high tec 3D glasses that are like real glasses that a friend gave me that work.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Nicely layer out, easy access features. Only problem is it usually force closes once a day. Not a huge problem, so I gave 4 stars.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased this book just to see what \\"everyone was talking about.\\"  I wish I had read the reviews first.  I tried to read it three times, but the writing is so poor and the story line so ridiculous that I gave up each time after a page or two.  How it became a best seller is a mystery.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|the graphics are great monsters are way better faster your not trapped in one area and they start you out with bad weapons

0439023521|1.0|Need we give our teenagers, whose fiction vs. reality line is almost non-existent, more reasons to pick up a weapon and go on a killing spree? Didn't Stephen Kind have a novel about a teenage boy going on a shooting rampage in high school and some kid took the book literally and did that? Kind pulled the books off the market because he wrote the book as a message to teenagers of what not to be.<br />Oh, go ahead, don't agree with my review, delete it if you want, but when an innocent life of a child is lost and the excuse for it is \\"Why is it OK to do this in \\"The Hunger Games?\\" then remember me.

0525953728|5.0|Let me first off and say I am not one that gets caught up in books.  But \\"No Easy Day\\" did just that.  I finish the book in about a day and a half.  I guess what really drew me in was the fact most of the place he was at, I was there also, just not at the same time and I was not a Seal.  I was an Army EOD tech.  I have been on mission with our SOCOM partners and let me tell you they are the elites.  He was able to break it down for an easy read and an entertaining one.  As for secret information, I didnt see anything you can not find on the internet.  Got the job done, all that matters.
B006ZTZF5K|5.0|Another wonderful episode. I just simply love the vampire diaries. It is one of my favorite shows. There is not an episode I don't like. Always suspenseful, thrilling, exciting, keeps you wanting more.
0060763280|5.0|As Anthony Robins says, \\"Success is 80% psychological and only 20% mechanical.\\" This book does an AMAZING job of rewiring poor circuitry, or \\"programming,\\" in your head. After that HUGE and necessary step towards building massive wealth, your actions will naturally lead to results beyond your wildest dreams. Rather than fighting an uphill battle with little to no fulfillment in life, read this book and make the journey towards exceptional wealth a natural part of your lifestyle.
B005SLS3ZU|5.0|Again an excellent read from this author. Lots of twists and turns keeps the interest from start to finish. Highly recommended.
1932735410|5.0|Didn't know what to think of at first, the book tells you exactly what to expect when taking the PMP test - not hiding a thing. It carries that straight forwardness on throughout the book while going over the different areas too. The book will say \\"If you don't know these X items, then maybe you're not ready to take the exam.\\" Overall I appreciate the forwardness and the upfront about the items. We all manage projects differently, but the exam assumes we all do it the same way and this book helps you get in that mind set.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was glad to see the next book in the series didntwwaste too much time with explaining the back story.

They are fearless heros.<br />His story really puts into perspective what they do.  The Bin Laden raid was<br />fasinating.  Why the Secretary of Defense is all burnt is beyond me. I'am<br />so sorry the media released his real name.  A must read.

A little skill and luck but still not bad ..  maybe a 7 rating on a 1 to 10 scale<br />It is certainly a lot better than some that cost more and for 99  cents hard to beat  ...  IMHO of course<br />The graphics are very good and the tablet response is excellent ...using an Android tablet

034580404X|1.0|The story of convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky is well known.  So too is the 50 Shades of Grey phenomena, a book that has become so popular among women that some are referring to it as \\"Mommy Porn\\" for the masses.  That description is actually a lot more disturbing than a lot of folks are currently realizing.    Yes, 50 Shades is pornography. Like most pornography, the storyline is weak, the characters one-dimensional, while the sex itself graphic, detailed, but formulaic.  The underlying theme to 50 Shades is something far more sinister and appalling though than your mere run-of-the-mill porn.  It is pedophilia.  It is child porn.  Kiddie porn.    Now I know after saying that, many female fans of 50 Shades, many of them mothers, will naturally put up a defense against that kind of description.  These women, being mothers, are naturally wired to protect kids.  People like Jerry Sandusky are viewed with hatred, revulsion, and disgust.  Rightfully so.  What mother would want to condone anything having to do with the sexual abuse of children?  Of innocents?    But that is exactly what 50 Shades of Grey is really about.  It is a story of a girl being sexually molested, over and over again, by a male figure with all the power, all the control.  It is the classic abuse scenario.  And mothers are, in some cases, quite literally getting off on it, which takes the disgust of this phenomena to a whole other frightening level.    So having put that out there, and I hope I haven't lost any of you just yet.  I owe you an explanation after having made that kind of accusation about a book some of you may be reading right now.  I'll start with a bit of background first.    My professional experience centers around nearly 20 years with Child Protective Services.  Over that time, I've seen situations that do, literally, keep me up at night.  The amount of abuse that is going on in our society, that sexualization of our kids...well basically, what you hear about, what is reportedin the news, that is only a small sample of just how large of a problem and the disgusting acts that are going on every day.  Kids are being raped.  Kids are being abused.  Every single day.  Over and over and over again.    I didn't seek out 50 Shades of Grey.  It was brought to my attention by a longtime friend who is also a clinical psychologist at a university.  She's a bit older than me.  She grew up in the counter culture era and did her fair share of experimentation of all kinds.  So she's hardly a prude.  What she today though is a mother and grandmother.  And she's smart.  One of the things that fascinates her is this age of cultural phenomena.  How due to technology things now spread so quickly throughout society and become the next big thing at an increasingly rapid pace.  She says sometimes this phenomena is pretty much harmless, and other times it can be very damaging to kids and or adults who begin to emulate something out of a need to belong to the \\"next big thing\\".    Her reaction to 50 Shades of Grey though was much more aggressively negative than anything I could recall her talking about before.  It came up because I mentioned it to her offhand.  I had seen a couple mentions of it on the news and knowing her interest in cultural trends, asked her about it.  She stopped talking, looked right at me, and said the book was about pedophilia.  And it was her who then connected it to the Sandusky tragedy where so many young boys had been sexually abused. Sandusky committed his acts of crime under the cover of actually helping youth.  That is how he gained access.  My friend said 50 Shades was basically the same exact thing.  Its cover was a story of a young woman engaging is a very graphic sexual relationship with a somewhat older man.    The problem for her, and it was a BIG PROBLEM, was that the narrator in the story, was in fact, an underage girl.  My friend indicated, based on the use of language in the narration, that this girl was likely no more than 12 or 13 years of age.  I made mention that the girl in the story was actually getting ready to graduate college.  My friend, a woman with years of experience as a clinical psychologist, whose expertise I had personally witnessed a number of times over the years, shook her head and told me that she would not be able to convince me by simply talking about it.  She said I should read the book myself, but do so with the eyes of somebody whose job it had been for many years to try and protect children.  As someone who has seen over and over the signs of abuse, and the damages of abuse.  Because there are always warning signs.  I know that.  How many times have I heard people horrified in saying \\"I can't believe I didn't see that\\"  \\"How couldn't I have known?\\"  Or even worse, \\"I knew something wasn't right but I didn't want to believe they were capable of doing something like that.\\"    I'll try and summarize my friend's words at this point as best I can.    \\"Sexual predators are cons.  They almost always have a cover.  It's that cover which allows them access.  50 Shades of Grey is a con.  It now has access to millions of readers.  It is a story about abuse from beginning to end.  And it's not just the abuse of a man and a woman - it's the abuse of a man and a girl.    When you read it, look for the signs.  They are all there.    The female character has no sexual experience.  None.  She is given the age of 21, but that age is itself a cover.  Her true emotional age is much-much younger.  She has never even masturbated.  She has never even experienced an orgasm.  That alone is one of the greatest attractions to the pedophile.  That is the psychology of that kind of act.  You get off on taking purity.    But move from the fact the girl has no sexual experience whatsoever.  Now pay attention to her narrative dialogue.  Really listen to how she talks.  Again, she's not talking like a young woman, she's talking like a girl.  She talks about cartwheels, and skipping, over and over again it is the language and the imagery of a girl.    After that this girl has her innocence taken from her.  The abuser, the older man, makes her think its her choice.  Again, you and I both know that is one of the primary tools of the pedophile.  They create an environment where the child feels it's their idea.  It's what they want. But what happens after that innocence is taken away?  Then the abuser becomes more openly abusive. Controlling.  In this story he tells the little girl how to speak.  What to wear.  What to eat.  He is Daddy and she is daughter.  When you read it read it like a mother who is also a woman who is experienced with the real life tragedy of abuse.    And there is many more themes about that abuse in this book.  There is spanking and the use of Baby oil.  Why baby oil?  Think about it.  The girl wears pigtails.  She complains that he is treating her like a child.  He says she acts like a child.  There is even a scene where the abuser creates a situation to take her innocence from her again.  He rips out her tampon and engages in forceful sex yet again.  Her hymen is ripped, and the bloody remnants of it are again symbolized in an act of pedophile rape.\\"    She went on to say there are women now defending the book, and she understands that, but it concerns her.  A great deal, because she is absolutely convinced the book is purposely advocating the raping of a child and attempting to normalize that atrocity.    So, I left that conversation thinking maybe my friend was exaggerating.  I had a hard time believing something so popular could actually have such a sinister and revolting theme, and while I respected her expertise and experience, thought this time she had to be seeing something that just wasn't there.    I got the book, I sat down, and I read it.    The first thing that struck me was how poor the writing was.  It wasn't just bad.  It was horrible.  But horrible writing is no crime, (thank goodness or I would have been put awaya long time ago) and it doesn't make the content of the story evil.  But in my reading of it, just like my friend said, the theme of child abuse, of pedophilia, was right there in plain sight.  I remember being told a long time ago that sometimes the best way to hide something is in plain sight.  That is what 50 Shades of Grey is really doing.    The main character had no sexual experience.  None.  She was an innocent.  She was a kid who had just had her first drink of alcohol.  No way that was an accident by the author.  That author had to have purposely made her, despite her given age of 21, by any other measure, a little girl.  At that point, it struck me as odd.  In my business, we call that a warning signal. A sign we may have a problem.    From there, just like my friend had warned, it got worse.  Much worse.  And she was right, her telling me about it did not have the impact of me reading it myself with eyes open.  She had given me the signs to look for, and as I turned the pages, those signs confirmed it over and over again.    The narration, which is the voice of the girl talking to the reader, was the voice of a little girl.  It's unmistakable.  There is very little emotional maturity and absolutely no sexual maturity.  She is seduced by this man in the very same way a pedophile seduces a child.  The male character is Gerry Sandusky.  He makes a show of his money, his power, the things he can buy for her, but while this is going on, we are reading the thoughts of a child.  We are reading the seduction of a little girl by a pedophile.  She is almost completely powerless.  She is naïve even for a teenager, and certainly much much more naïve than a college student.  She is incapable of even making the most simple of every day decisions and must be told what to do by her abuser, who in turn though spends a lot of time and effort convincing this child this is really what she wants.  I've seen this before.  Too often.  Too many times.  And it always leaves mesickened.    We are reading child pornography.  Remove the false age of the girl, which has no basis in reality, and what we are actually reading is the abuse of a little girl.    The main character is described in pigtails, given words like \\"Holy Cow\\"  \\"down there\\", \\"jeez\\"  \\"double crap\\" she can't operate a computer (but is supposedly a college graduate), describes skipping and doing cartwheels, repeatedly says she is made to feel like a child, has her imaginary friend (inner goddess) feels shame, is spanked and slathered in BABY OIL, told what to say, what to eat, what to do, until finally and sadly so predictably, is physically beaten.  (But she returns to him soon after, which is again, a very common theme of abuse, including pedophilia)    And beyond all of this evidence there is the fact that the male character is himself a product of sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile.  The girl whose thoughts we listen in on as she is being abused, recognizes this aspect of the male abuser, but apparently, is too naïve or unwilling to realize she has continued this cycle of abuse herself. (Which again reinforces the idea that she is actually herself just a child)  There is no way the author did this by accident.  She puts out the theme of pedophilia openly, therefore hiding it in plain sight.    People who have had to deal with the real world of sexual abuse of children will understand this perhaps more easily than others.  How the pedophile is so often themselves victims of earlier abuse.  They enter society, they become fathers or mothers, but so often they too become abusive.  They seek out dominance, control, and the taking of innocence just as it was taken from them.  Those who were once abused, become the abuser.  It is the sad sick and tragic cycle of pedophilia.    With 50 Shades of Grey this abnormal condition is trying to be normalized.  Thanks to the insight of my friend, and my own experience,  I know it for what it truly is - a story of the sexual abuseof child, wrapped in the cliché cover story of a mysterious and troubled wealthy man.  That is another thing my clinical psychologist friend pointed out later.  Take away the aspect of money, and the character of the abuser becomes much less attractive and therefore it would have been much more difficult to pull of the deception.  Are women actually that shallow?  Yes, we can be.    But women, the vast majority of us, are not people who knowingly condone the sexual abuse of children.  We do not condone in any way, the horror that is pedophilia.    Sadly though, that is exactly what is happening with the popularity of 50 Shades of Grey.  It's a pedophilia con.    It is one of the most horrible and sickening acts against the most powerless of our society, hiding in plain sight.    Maybe my friend put it best when we talked all of this over.  50 Shades of Grey didn't excite her.  She didn't find it interesting, sexy, or romantic.    50 Shades of Grey made her weep.  It made her sick.  It made her think of the abuses of all of those kids by a demented, warped monster like Jerry Sandusky, who, just like the pedophilia of 50 Shades of Grey, was hiding in plain sight.    [...]

B001DELX08|5.0|Operas are either recorded with stage microphones only or stage microphones combined with wireless body microphones. If only stage microphones are used, the sound of the voices will vary depending on the direction the singer is facing. If he is close to the microphone and faces it, the voice will sound best. If he sings sideways to a partner or sings from the rear of the stage, the voice will be recorded less loud. This actually replicates the experience the audience has at the live performance, but is often magnified  as microphones have uneven directional sensibility.<br />For best audio for the live audience, the performers often stand up front and sing towards the audience, making it a somewhat static production. Or they act and move around, making it a less pleasant audio experience with the voices going up and down in loudness.<br />Voila, in comes the body microphone, which picks up the sound regardless which way the singer faces. Thus you can get recorded sound from an opera that actually sounds better on a disk than in a live performance, if body microphones are used.<br /><br />A good demonstration can be had with the L.A. La Traviata with Fleming/Villazon/Conlon, which is a stage microphones only recording vs. the Milano version with Gheorghiu/Vargas/Maazel, which uses body microphones.<br /><br />While the picture quality is pretty much even in both performances and very good, the voices in the surround sound track fluctuate constantly as the principals move around in the L.A version, while they are rock solid in the Milano version.<br />This alone makes the Milano version preferable for me.<br />In addition, the orchestra and the chorus are recorded with a wider sound stage and give me more the feeling of sitting in one of the front rows. Furthermore, I think Gheorghiu plays the part of Violetta better than Fleming. While I enjoy Villazon in Romeo and Juliet (body mics.), I prefer a steady Vargas over an \\"up and down\\" Villazon. The only one quite steadyin the L.A performance is Bruson, who moves little and sings to the front.  But Frontali is an acceptable Giorgio for me.<br /><br />So 5 stars for Milano, only 3 for L.A., mostly based on the recording technique used.<br /><br />Another Traviata recording I have using body microphones is the Bonfadelli/Piper/Domingo DVD, which has a 5.1 surround track. While the picture is not as good, it is well recorded with the sound stage a little less wide, but the voices are very clear and the balance with chorus and orchestra is the best of the 3. The acting (directed by Zeffirelli) especially of Bonfadelli, is also the most convincing. If it were available in HD, it would be a toss-up with the Milano version for me and would get 5 stars, too.

1451696191|4.0|A charming read. Almost everyone can identify with the awkwardness of Charlie. He's just beginning high school. He feels like there's \\"something wrong with him\\" and he knows other people think so, too. For the first time, he's got some very cool friends, Sam and Patrick. They start to bring Charlie a little out of his shell.<br /><br />We find Charlie kind of simple in his writing style and outlook on life. But, we gain a greater understanding when we realize that his English teacher tells him, \\"You are the most talented person I've ever met. Ever.\\"<br /><br />Charlie knows how to fight, there's a deeply repressed aggression in him, which comes out on more than one occasion. There's also a sweet and tenderness inside. He really cares about his family, and his friends.<br /><br />We cheer for Charlie, even as we cringe during the times he's less than stellar in his choices.<br /><br />This book is full of quotable quotes and little things that will make you tear up. Charming and a very quick read at only 214 pages. I recommend!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|When I first tried several difference keyboards, SwiftKey was a must have keyboard. It had a few bugs, but the predictions were so good I could put up with the bugs until they were fixed. I have said I would never pay for an app, but after trying SwiftKey, I  changed my mind. The bugs haven't been fixed, and have actually gotten much worse! I am now using go keyboard until either SwiftKey gets this keyboard working better than a beta, or until go keyboard gets much better word predictions. SwiftKey predictions are far, far ahead of any other keyboard I have tried, and I have tried a lot. SwiftKey's ability to split predicted words into two words is also way ahead of any other keyboard I have tried. If go keyboard could even come close on predictions, I would just give up on the paid SwiftKey app, and stick with go keyboard. I would rather keep SwiftKey since I paid for it, but I am not holding my breath on that one. I have not gotten any help from support, other  than the forum, where people are complaining about the same problems and SwiftKey responds telling us that we are doing something wrong. Problem is that we are doing exactly what they say and it still doesn't work, but we don't get anymore responses. I have since requested a full refund, since this keyboard should be a beta until it is working much better, and a beta should be free. Of course, just like in the past trying to get it fixed, I didn't even get a response. I guess they are to busy add adding new features instead of fixing bugs that have been there for several month. I guess new features mean more money in their pocket!
B007OAAK0O|4.0|I held on to the complete and original VCR broadcast recording of this concert as long as I could.  I would watch it just to see Diana in a different environment unlike a concert theatre or in Las Vegas.  I waited 30 years for the release of this Central Park Live concert on DVD with much anticipation.  Ms. Ross is Ms. Ross and there is no question about that - whether it is a hit or miss.  She performs her songs in the Motown style of medleys and sped up versions.  Even Madonna does this.  However, the edited concert should have been released in its entirety, and Diana could have included many of her other favorable hits. Who cares about bad shots, unclear audio, and mistakes.  These things always happen in live performances and are representative of the times it was recorded. Ms. Ross still reigns (rains) SUPREME. I LOVE YOU!!!
0446547646|1.0|This was a really disappointing book.  Are we to believe that a man pining for his lost teen love remains single and a hermit for so long?  His background story was just nuts.  Amanda's story wasn't bad but the progression was fairly predictable, the supernatural was silly and the ending was nuts!  It had so much potential in the beginning....I just got bored, I didn't like any of the characters really.  I skimmed to the silly ending and then I threw the book across the room -  annoyed that I had wasted so much time on it!

We loved every episode. The characters really grow on you and become \\"family.\\"  With few exceptions, the British accents are easy to understand.  It is definitely a \\"Masterpiece.\\"  Can't wait for the new season to begin.

When you finally do get them on the phone their answers help for about one day before the problem either repeats itself or something else goes wrong. I still have tons of trouble with the alarm going off because it says the camera is disconnected. But the camera is not disconnected...so I reset everything, re-enter all passwords and other bs that is a complete headache.<br />AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Here are some of the happy greeting card sentiments that Bob has on Tempest:<br /><br />They chirp and they chatter, What does it matter?<br />They lie and dine in their blood<br />Two-timing slim  Who's every heard of him?<br />I'll drag his corpse through the mud<br /><br />I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done<br />Sooner or later you make a mistake,<br />I'll put you in a chain that you never will break<br />Legs and arms and body and bone<br />I pay in blood, but not my own.<br /><br />I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?<br />You bas**ard! I'm supposed to respect you!<br />I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse<br />Show me your moral that you reversed<br />Hear me holler and hear me moan<br />I pay in blood but not my own.<br /><br />I can dress up your wounds with a blood-clotted rag<br />I ain't afraid to make love to a b**ch or a hag<br />If you see me comin' and you're standing there<br />Wave your handkerchief in the air<br /><br />I'll have no more of this insulting chat<br />the devil can have you i'll see to that<br />look sharp or step aside or in the cradle you'll wish you died<br /><br />you shot my husband down you fiend<br />husband what, husband what the hell do you mean<br />he was man of strife a man of sin<br />i cut him down and i throw him to the wind<br /><br />Personally I am tired of this increased trend of hatred in Dylan's music. Yes, I know there have been angry songs in Dylan's work, and some of them awesome - Like A Rolling Stone and Idiot Wind among others. But the last few albums are awash in this sort of thing. I think it is effective once in a while but now it is overkill and poor art.<br /><br />I know my review will not be helpful to many of you but I have a dissenting view of all the 5 star reviews given out by both amazon reviewers and practically all of the media. In my opinion Tempest is a very good album (WAY better than Together Through Life and Christmas In The Heart) but lacking compared to the great trilogy that came before - Time Out Of Mind, Love And Theft and Modern Times. Do you remember when Rolling Stone could be counted on to give an objective review of an album even if it was by Dylan, Springsteen or Young. I can forgive excited fans giving new work by their favorite artists 5 stars on amazon but I can't forgive Rolling Stone giving Tempest and Wrecking Ball 5 stars.<br /><br />Some of these songs are very enjoyable and it is always great to have new music by Bob to dissect over the coming months. But many of these songs are lacking. I feel that Bob is coasting here. He has cobbled together his usual Dylanisms that he tends to use over the last few years. Semi-profound, clever lines that often don't mean much when you look at them closely. They are often interchangeable and could be inserted into quite a few of his songs. It sounds a bit fake to me. Many of these songs will not stand the test of time. I'm already bored of the title track; the Titanic went down faster than the time it takes to go through this song. I think Bob could have used a producer on here instead of self producing. Some songs are quite moving but other sound a bit harsh. And Bob should have definitely used the phlegm bucket before recording this take of Pay In Blood, probably the roughest Dylan's voice has ever sounded.<br /><br />I know this is all blasphemous but I have been a fan for 30 years myself and am as emotionally invested in new work by Bob as the next guy. This is just an alternative viewpoint to what I think is the usual knee jerk \\"Masterpiece!\\" verdict to anything Bob produces that has any quality at all. I don't think in 5 years most of us will be listening to Tempest anywhere near to how much we listen to quality semi recent material like Time Out Of Mind. But of course this is all subjective. Maybe to you this is the best since Blood On The Tracks.<br /><br />I will end on a positive note. I DO think that Scarlet Town is a masterpiece - incredible vocal, lyric, even production. Very evocative and genuinely frightening. (Try listening to Scarlet Town back to back with Leonard Cohen's Waiting For A Miracle. 2 great songs with similar grim subject matter). The fact that Dylan is still producing quality material at 71 years old is admirable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Pocket Edition of Minecraft is a great game. It's a bit more simple than the minecraft currently out for PC, but it still has tons of content. Don't getme wrong! Simple is good. If you're playing survival, for example, there's no cheat codes to get instant stuff! It's survival only, baby! Aslo: I see a person here who gave it 1 star because they couldn't find any wifi games. Please read about how things work, the wifi section is for LAN, people, it means they have to be in your wifi network aka someone right next to you on their own device. It's not full-fledged wifi yet

B003L77G6A|5.0|Gets better every year. Reminds me of my college roommates and myself almost every week. Can hardly wait to see what happens next.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|The story is not as well weaved and reads somewhat like a romance novel...where the last story left off with the hero more confident he is plunged for most of the book into tired whining about relationship issues.  Instead of wasting time with the author should have connected all the sub-story lines together. I am undecided if I will read more in this series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this book is soooooooooooo good, but who would you want to be? i would want to be leo because i like to build things and feel<br />uncomfortable around other people.
0756405890|5.0|I honestly do not think I will be able to coherently explain how much I adore this book.<br />This book quite literally has everything a fantasy fan could ask for, it of course has the magical element to it, but it also has action, romance, tragedy, splashes of comedy, beautiful moments between family and friends. There's nothing I love more than a main character who takes control of their own life and grows and matures in the process and that is exactly what Kvothe does with his. One of my favourite aspects of the book, and its sequel, is the amazing detailed world that they inhabit. I am a staunch believing of the fact that a well-structured, intricate and complex world is needed in any fantasy novel to make it work and Rothfuss does it brilliantly. And of course there's the brilliantly characters, not one of them is two-dimensional, they all of their good points and bad points, their flaws and good qualities, hopes and fears and they are all so very real and human and simply beautifully written.<br />Do not be put of by the length (which isn't actually all that long when you sit down and get to it) or that of it's sequel, it is well worth the read. Instantly became my favourite book the moment I read it.
3836531038|5.0|When I read about the premise of the book, I was intrigued. I am not disappointed in the end result. It is an interesting view of how women view themselves with a camera.<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK to all artists, especially photographers - it will give you insight into what is a good pose or setting
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A little short but full of dreams, real life hopes and sadness. I read it back in school, but now it shows so many hidden messages about friendship and about human beings nature
B008KOMMTA|4.0|I give this 4 out of 5 due to the sound. The spoken word scenes should have increased volume to match action, music scenes. I have my TV on full blast and it is hard to hear some of the dialogue. The original DVD release has higher sound quality! THen, when music or action scenes come in, I need to lower the sound. In the scene where Cal slaps Rose, you can hear a clock ticking on the original DVD, on the blu ray, you can't!!<br /><br />But the box of and content of the collectors edition is great. And the Visual blu ray is fantastic.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|Been mistreating my hair forever! Didn't know how to properly take care of my hair - I would blow \\"fry\\" it (using expensive/professional blow dryers thinking that would do the trick), flat iron it (again, using the best flat iron brand) or use hot rollers, use all kinds of hair products and it would be beautiful until I walked out the house and then \\"POOF\\"...humidity would destroy my efforts.  My hair was dull, never shiny, never manageable and had a halo of frizz.  I started using WEN products in January 2012, but I wasn't acheiving the desired results promised.  After 8 months, I FINALLY got fed up and actually thought about shaving my head (like Sinead O'Connor)!! Thank goodness I did a little research on curly hair and found this handbook.  I was so excited that I ordered it right away and told my curly/dry/frizzy sisters about it, too.  Boxed up my WEN (can't throw it out, yikes, too expensive) and found the DevaCurl products at the local ULTA store, not that you HAVE to use her products, I'm just one of those, if I'm going to try this, I might as well do it right. I did throw out loads of hair products that contained parabens, butane, propane...was horrified that I had been putting this stuff in my hair.  No wonder it was suffering!<br /><br />You can't be in denial of your curly hair...in fact, I thought I had just plain wavy hair until I started using this method..it's been about a month...I've got curls all over my head (like the gal on the cover, just not as gorgeous, YET!)  Still going through trial and error to get it right...like the book says...all curls are different.  There is a section on what to ask a stylist when trying to find someone to cut your curls.  I was lucky enough to have found a DEVACHAN trained hairdresser in the next town; having support to go all curly and get the right cut is tremendous!  Even if you haven't decided to commit, this book is a great easy read. The author's voice and sense of humor comes through loud and clear...she isso funny!  (Don't think it's corny...makes me smile.)  Also, made several of the homemade hair products.  They're great, too.

Either way I went ahead and ordered it and it was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Today will be my 5th day using it and its very quick to learn. She keeps you motivated just when your about to give up. Instead of waiting till Im comfortable to go up in levels, I followed another reviews recommendation about going from level 1 to level 2, to level 3 and back down again. I was in so much pain after the first few workouts but now Im starting to look forward to it!<br /><br />5/5 completely worth your time!

B005G4TJI4|1.0|This movie is terrible.  It is the kind of movie that you could dissect frame by frame and explain why literally EVERYTHING that is happening is stupid.  Everything. There is nothing redeeming about this film.  There is nothing memorable about this film.  There is nothing original, creative, or imaginative about this film.  Watching this film is like being chocked to death by having roadkill jammed down your throat.<br /><br />Join me my friends on a journey of explanation - together we will walk the yellow brick road of why this film sucks.<br /><br />The plot makes no sense.  None.  A ship escapes Cybertron during the last days of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons.  The ship is caring some \\"Prime\\" guy and a technological wonder - some sort of teleportation machine.  Apparently the Prime guy is a tech wiz and he is the only one that can make this teleportation apparatus work... and it is special because it could have \\"ended the war.\\"  How?  Who knows.  Nevermind.<br /><br />Well, the ship gets damaged and miraculously crosses half the known universe to crash on the dark side of the Moon.  Apparently, the Decepticons discover the ship at some point and they take most of the columns that make up the teleportation device.  However, they leave the Prime and 4 of the columns - because Prime is the only one that can operate the machine and they are going to trick the Autobots many years in the future into traveling to the moon to find the ship, and the Prime, bring him back to Earth with the 4 remaining columns, and use the Matirx to reactive him (because the Matrix is the only way to do it), then Prime will betray the Autobots and work with Megatron to reactivate the teleportation machine to \\"bring\\" Cybertron into Earth space for some reason that would actually make a difference but we really aren't sure of.<br /><br />Got all that?<br /><br />Hey Moondonkey? You ask.  How are the Autbots going to learn about the ship on the moon?<br /><br />Weeeelllllllll...for some reason the Autobots are going to attack an underground Russian installation and find a piece of the ship.  Except that the Decepticons will also have a big worm-like robot there fighting to get the piece of the ship as well (sort of like a metal sandworm from Dune).  The Autobots need to defeat the worm in order to find the ship part so that they can discover the existence of the ship so that they can rescue Prime so that that can reactivate Prime so that Prime can betray the Autobots so that Prime can activate the teleportation machine so that a bunch of Decepticons can jump into Earth space (from where?) so that the decepticons can take over a big city (I forget which one it was) so that they can activate the machine from the top of a sky scraper so that they can teleport Cybertron into Earth space.<br /><br />Again - got all that.<br /><br />Soooo... what if the Decepticon worm had \\"won\\" and gotten away with the spacechip part?  What then?  Then the Autobots wouldn't realize the ship was on the moon and the Decepticon plot to activate the machine would fail.  Ok... So why the F is a damn Decepticon worm fighting the Autobots for the ship part?  Huh?  Why not just let the Autobots find the damn thing?  What sense does this make?<br /><br />And this is just one example of how stupid this movie is.<br /><br />Another brief example:<br />Skip back for a minute - recall how the Autobots went to the moon to find the ship.  They used a spaceship, right?  Later in the movie the Autobots get kicked off of Earth by the humans and they have to rig up a spaceship using shuttle parts because they don't have a ship capable of space travel.  Uhhhh... wait a minute, then what the heck did they use to travel to the moon in the first place?  Why doesn't that ship work?<br /><br />Another example:<br />When the Decepticons take over the city, where do the giant Decepticon ships come from?  There are these giant alien Decepticon ships flying around.  Where did they come from?  When the Prime opens the teleportation gate for the first time, a FEW Decepticons slip through.  Ok, fine.  But there sure as heck weren't any giant Decepticon ships that came through the gate.  The next thing we know there is some sort of Decepticon space navy flying around.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't go into every detail of how this movie sucks because it would probably take 20 pages.  I'm serious.  You can dissect every single scene in this film and explain how and why it is stupid.  Every scene.<br /><br />Oh - final point.  Who is the moron that came up with the idea of making some of the autobots into stupid little comedy relief robots?  Any why would some robots have \\"old\\" looking robot hair like balding old men?  S...T...U...P...I...D.

0312641893|5.0|**4.5 stars**<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the Cinderella fairy tale, but I might be biased, seeing as how I never really liked the Disney version. I was more of a Beauty and the Beast girl. I always thought the Cinderella in the movie was so domesticated, and she needed a man to get away from her evil stepmother. Plus, the prince and her fell in love in like two seconds. And she loses her shoe, and the prince's brillant idea is to go around and try to find a girl whose foot fits perfectly into the shoe. Because of course he wouldn't recognize the girl he fell in love with once she has her hair down and is covered in ashes. And there are no two girls with the same size shoe (obviously sarcasm). I hope I didn't ruin anybody's love for this fairy tale. I did love Ever After though. One of my favorite movies. Though A Cinderella Story? Not so much.<br /><br />So you can imagine that I was very surprised when I found myself loving Cinder despite all of my bias and negative expectations. How couldn't I love this book? It's the most imaginative retelling of Cinderella that I have ever seen or read! Not only is Cinder a cyborg, but the story takes place in the distant future. Cinder is a flipping Asian cyborg! Instead of talking, singing mice, we have her robot friend Iko. Instead of a pumpkin turning into a carriage, we have a yellow-orange car which is considered ancient when hovers are the new form of transportation. And the dashing prince is the destined emperor of the Eastern Commonwealth (what Asia is now called). Is that not genius?<br /><br />In Cinder, Earth is divided into six kingdoms after World War IV left the world in ruins and nuclear/chemical warfare destroyed many natural resources. A plague, letumosis, kills hundreds and even thousands of Earthen citizens, and doctors can't find the cause or a cure. Prejudice is shown towards cyborgs, and the cyborg draft is initiated to find guinea pigs for antidote research. As Earth is left vulnerable by the plagueand a suffering economy, the Lunar queen seizes this opportunity to make negotiations with the soon-to-be emperor Prince Kai. The Lunars have mysterious powers to influence what others feel, see, or even do. Queen Levena is a cruel queen and a threat to all of Earth because of her hunger for power. When Cinder's stepsister Peony is infected with the plague, Cinder is entered against her will into the cyborg draft by her stepmother. Cinder finds out she might just be the only hope for her sister, New Beijing, and maybe all of Earth.<br /><br />This book was such a thrilling, fun read! While I never thought I'd be a huge fan of science-fiction, I loved the technology and futuristic New Beijing. Cinder was a mechanic, and Meyer did an excellent job of describing Cinder's work and repairs. Meyer's attention to detail made the world of New Beijing all the more authentic, and I loved hearing about the portscreens, netscreens, and hovers. The city, with its skyscrapers and crammed apartment complexes, came to life for me through Meyer's in-depth description. The beautiful descriptions of New Beijing's palace and gardens were also not lacking in detail. New Beijing culture was a perfect mix of futuristic and traditional Asian elements.<br /><br />Cinder was such an awesome heroine! She was just full of spunk! I loved how Meyer made Cinder a mechanic famous for her skill instead of a maid, placing less focus on domesticity. While Cinder was dependent on her evil stepmother Adri, she still stood up for herself and found ways to rebel. She even beat up some androids and she was far from being a submissive, docile maid. She also had a kinder, loving side because she cared for her android Iko and her younger stepsister Peony. And of course Kai though she tried to deny it. It was difficult for her being a cyborg, and I loved seeing her fight past her insecurities and become a stronger individual because of it.<br /><br />I didn't like Kai as much as other romantic interests. Hegrew on me, but I couldn't help finding him a little annoying at times. It seemed like he expected special treatment because he was a prince, and I was overjoyed when Cinder didn't respond to his advances as he expected. I was sick of hearing about what a heartthrob he was and having girls swoon over him (basically the Asian Bieber). Though I'm being a little hypocritical seeing as how I fangirl over Jensen Ackles and Ian Somerhalder from time to time. I did love that while the romance was sweet, it was put on a back burner in favor of the plot. And Kai was charming at times, and understanding and adorable.<br /><br />My one major complaint was the cliffhanger ending. I'm not a fan of cliffhangers. Who is? I see cliffhangers as just an author's attempt to persuade readers to read the next book. Unfortunately, this tends to be a generally effective method. If the sequel was immediately available, I wouldn't be as upset, but it isn't. I just like my books to have an ending. Even if there are still questions and other books, having somewhat of an ending is always better than a cliffhanger. There were a couple of other minor annoyances. Characters say Oh my stars a lot. And Iko was a little unrobotic. But Meyer explains the personality chip as being the cause.<br /><br />I'm so excited for Scarlet! I want to hear more about this world and the Lunars. Such as, why are they even on the moon?

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I first heard about this novel when I went to the movies and saw a trailer for the movie that is coming out about it soon. I thought that the trailer looked really good so i decided to give the novel a shot. I was not disappointed. It is really a great read. It is well written and keeps you interested at all points. My only complaint was that it did repeat it self a lot, but given that the main character is mentally ill it is understandable and makes the book sound a little more realistic. I dont want to give too much away about it, but it really is a great read.
0061726834|3.0|Delirium shared many similarities with other dystopian reads, but it had that nice twist of love being forbidden. In Lena's world, no one says I love you or they're considered diseased. The uncured wait till their 18th birthdays to have a procedure that will prevent them from feeling any love or compassion for others. The indifference of the cured was truly haunting. When it came to parenting, maternal love or any devotion to offspring was absent. Spouses procreated simply for the continuation of humanity. Love was missing from the equation, but everybody still swore by the procedure. They claimed happiness in their indifference, and anyone who thought different was labeled as a sympathizer and was executed or left to rot in a cell. It was terrifying for me to even imagine a world without love. Where a mother is apathetic towards her crying child. Or a husband and wife go through life feeling nothing for each other though they sleep next to each other in the same bed every night.<br /><br />What really appealed to me about Delirium was that romantic love wasn't the sole focus. I expected the entire book to concentrate on the forbidden romance between Alex and Lena, but I was pleasantly surprised. While Lena and Alex's growing interest in each other is certainly a main point, we also witness the love Lena feels for her best friend Hana and the love she feels for her family, such as her cousin Gracie and her mother. We're able to see all different sorts of love, and the complexity of Lena's feelings. How easily anger, hurt, and fear can overlap with love. I found Lena's connections to her loved ones so touching and endearing, and I loved Hana, Alex, and Gracie (even though she doesn't speak).<br /><br />I had some difficulty accepting how quickly Lena shifts from being a steadfast believer in the cure to an outright rebel. I loved how Lena started off as an unquestioning follower of her society, allowing us to see her full progression into rebellion. But for someone who was so excited to be cured, Lena changes so rapidly, and I didn't completely buy it. Even if Alex and Lena were madly in love, Lena was raised with certain beliefs that she cherished, but yet she drops them so quickly.<br /><br />While I loved the dark twist of love being outlawed, I had trouble immersing myself into the story. There were no slow parts, but I was never completely invested in this book. Maybe the dystopia just wasn't authentic enough? I found it difficult to believe in this world without knowing the background behind the cure and the labeling of love as a disease. While it's fascinating, I needed more context and I couldn't help wanting more to this world than some groups of regulators walking around with flashlights and bullhorns. That image did not have me quaking in fear. Oliver writes beautifully - her writing style could almost be called poetic - and I loved the inclusion of poetry and classical literature (Romeo and Juliet!) as always, but I just didn't connect with what I was reading.<br /><br />I have to say that while there were differences, Delirium resembled Uglies in so many ways. The Smoke versus The Wilds. The procedure and the main character who goes from supporter to rogue. Not to mention the best friend who participates in rebellious behavior? Did anyone see this as well? It didn't bother me, but it just struck me as really similar. Random thought, I know. Though I enjoyed this book more because I could not stand Tally Youngblood.<br /><br />I will read Pandemonium, but I'm in no hurry. I'm anxious to see how this series unfolds, but I hope the sequel interests me more.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very good app for the kindle. It all so helps tell how much battery you have.  So I reckamed this app.
B007T4NWHS|5.0|This is one of the best episodes of The New Girl. I mainly like it for the game they play, True American. You can find the rules online and it's great for a small amount of people to play, like 5 or 6.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so much fun! I cannot put it down! the only reason it is not five stars is because it is sometimes slow on my kindle fire. The upgrading is a little tedious to get the needed coins. But over all it is a fantastic addictive game!

B0087HT36U|4.0|This is a fun game! It is a lot like Angry Birds but my 5year-old says it's easier. :) You launch stones, etc. at a castle but you launch them face-on ( does that make sense?) so it is a little different. The graphics are cute, too!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is the next temple run. a fun app the challenges you with missions and keeps you coming back for more.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, had a hard time putting it down. Just started the 2nd one, I'm sure it will be as good as the first one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to pinterest and use this app on my Kindle Fire. The ONLY complaint I have is that there is no &quot;scroll to top&quot; button.  It works perfectly; as a matter of fact I prefer using this app to accessing pinterest from my laptop.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|very entertaining game for the kindle fire. haven't found many games I enjoy through the kindle app store with the exception of this one.
B008PZ69T8|3.0|I purchased this as soon as it was available.  I have to say I was disappointed.  The performances of the chosen selections are luke warm and just pleasant - as opposed to passionate.  For instance check out Pachelbel's Canon performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and compare it to the one featured here; or Bachianas Brasileras No. 5 performed by Elina Garanca - and tell me whether after having heard those versions - this compilation doesn't seem somewhat less than stellar.  Believe me I am no snob - but I would have preferred more passionate performances.  Maybe this was made to appeal to a more middle of the road audience.  But since the trilogy was not middle of the road - I thought the performances would follow suit.  I would suggest for those who really enjoyed the selections - compile your own.  If you want to put a baby to sleep - go for this one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love love LOVE Pintrest and this app does it justice. The only thing wrong with it is, you have to restart it a lot because it freezes up. Or it won't start up at all. BUT when it's running smoothly, it's ADDICTING!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great and I spend a lot of time playing it. my kids love it too. it is awesomee It is very intriguing :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love dicts. they give so much info!!!some  dicts.are not useful because they are small.     but thats ok though:)<br /><br />                                                PEACE
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots to do love all the tasks and characters. my kids love it and so do I.wish the energy didn't go so fast
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Thanks for a great app. Even though I got it for free, it is worth the $0.99 regular price. Uses logic rather than luck and isn't timed, so it's more relaxing than most games.<br /><br />/
B0086QS7N2|5.0|You must listen to this more than once. It may not hit you at first and each time you listen you'll hear something new. When most bands rest on their laurels and pack it in, Rush continues to grow and challenge. 'Clockwork Angels' is a masterpiece. Let's hope it isn't a swan song!
B008JTK9NW|4.0|I've been listening to this band for a long time and love their music so this CD is no exception.  They're a great bunch of guys and seem really devoted to what they do.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever I wish their was more games like this one keep making them I love love love this game
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|I read about this app in the New York Times, which gave it a favorable review.  I was OK with just getting Missile Command for free, that's all I wanted.  After a few days of playing with it (a decent game, once you find a control panel layout that works for you), all of a sudden I start getting ads all over the place on this iphone.  During the game, between games, even breaking into other apps.  It's like downloading this just opened the floodgates.  I never had a problem with ads before, and now I can't get rid of them.  I thought maybe I'd been duped into downloading some malicious app.  So if you think Missile Command is free, don't believe it.  The cost is this flood of ads.  Wish I'd never downloaded it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|cool ....great game to kill time ....need more objects in the rooms...wish there were more games like it. maybe u will make some
0545265355|1.0|I just finished the series and it is terrible. The first book is dark but entertaining, but the rest of the series fails to redeem itself.  The author creates a typical dystopia, adds a gladiatorial arena with children in it, and then drags this concept out through three poorly written books to see how badly she can mess with her characters, and disappoint her readers. Do not waste your time reading this series, and don't reward this author for writing junk like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can easily access my Pinterest account from my Droid and Fire. So easy to use and has only froze on me once.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Its addicting but there's always ads trying to get you to by things. If they weren't there I would rate it better.
B00007E8SW|5.0|The sound on this SACD is simply magnificent but it should be noted that this is a stereo SACD, so don't buy it expecting it to be a multi-channel 5.1 mix.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|It's not just a story about sushi, it's a story about art, life, love and family. And sushi.<br /><br />Really well done. And raw.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like all the different activities and how fast the energy rebuilds. seems easy to accomplish tasks.  having difficulty gaining friends
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book, once i started to read it i could not put it down. It is a very interesting book to read. I am on the second book now and can't wait to read the last book.
B0081L391C|5.0|I've watched this twice, the guy from Parks and Recreation is in it for a brief cameo. It really was funny. That's my twenty words.
B004UB9SKS|3.0|THis product was not bad but it was not great either. I used it for the Thai language and with that language you really need a program that tells you how the sound is made, not just what the word looks like. I had already purchased books that can help me with useful phrases. The explanation of this product lead me to believe that it would be able to translate what I wanted to say if I typed it in. Overall, not a bad buy and after being in the US I still look over it to stay up on my Thai
0143036424|5.0|I'm not a big reader until I start reading this series of books. Love them. They get better as you go threw the series.
034580404X|5.0|The boxed set was like new. I enjoyed reading them, but felt they were almost too erotic. Got a little bored with the dominance thing. Purchase arrived in a timely matter.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Note, it is a pro military movie. However, I am pro military. I believe this film gives an outstanding view of the excellence of the United States Marine Corps. Those men and women are amazing. Loved the movie Battleship as well.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Hyper-paced action will keep you fixated throughout. An aging Arnold makes a cameo appearance. Bruce Willis' does little more than cheapen the movie with a spew of junior high locker room talk. Fortunately, his role is brief.
B007BGU4S4|5.0|Inspirational piano music that is enjoyable to listen to.  Earth Wind and Fire music that makes you want to dance!  Nina Simone and George Benson to top it off!  From solemn to upbeat, great soundtrack.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Was hoping for an edge of the seat experience, which it did not produce. The special effects were fine and I liked the cast of characters. Just not as exciting as I was hoping it would be.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This movie gives me a renewed feeling of pride in the United States military. It is impressive how powerful those vessels are.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Very exciting movie.  One of the best of Mission Impossible films. The action sequences were very Challenging and interesting, especially sice Tom Cruze  did his own stunts.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|I love this concept, because I for one am not good with a controller. I have panic thumbs so when it comes down to FPS online, I can't seem to do it. That's where the guys at Penguin came out with something great, and that's the Eagle Eye for PS3/Xbox consoles! I for one use mine on the PS3 and for Battlefield 3 only. It almost feels like PC although, PC is far more superior in frame rates and everything else overall, but that's not Penguin's fault. Here's why they get 3 stars... They're lazy. The main reason why they're lazy is because many PC's nowadays run 64bit operating systems for better performance all around, The Eagle Eye's drivers on the other hand does not support 64bit systems (at least mine doesn't). So, why can't they create 64bit supporting drivers, rather than keeping the 32bit drivers? One word: Lazy. Simply lazy. They seriously have a tutorial on a fix, but seriously? Who want's to go through all the time and effort to make this thing work correctly by installing VIRTUAL PC'S and running them at 32bit? It's insane! Not worth it in that catagory. 3 stars until they fix this problem, you'll get a perfect 5 from me and all, but customer is always right, and you should make it easier on the customer, rather than making us do all the work! Not cool guys, not cool.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i was using another spider solitare app before this one, the version is far superior to the other one.  cards respond appropriately when moved. I 'm addicted!
B005SAV9SO|5.0|Warning if you are sensitive, do not watch this movie. I think this might make my top 10 list.  In fact most people I know laughed through the entire movie, then said they hated it.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|when I leave wifi zones the games progress will some times reset I have lost my glu coins, characters and upgrades 6+ times. its a good game but frustrating with constant resets.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|BEST Santana EVER!!! A MUST HAVE! Well worth the wait for a new album. FANTASTIC new music with alittle of the old mixed in.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Canada by Richard Ford was tedious! Too much detail in descriptions, not much happened in real time, the characters, except for the father did not come alive.  I still do not have a picture of the mother. Was she short, tall skinny fat, was she a victim or did she choose her lot? I know she had unruly hair.  If this had not been a book club selection I would not have chosen to read more than the first two chapters.<br /><br />The first page is probably the best. At least it does motive you to continue on until the next chapter.
0385344333|5.0|I shall not repeat the reviewers who provided a story synopsis. Rather, I'm writing this review for the Lee Child/Reacher fans who may be wondering about all of the negative reviews. I've not checked, but would chance a guess that the current three star average must be the lowest Mr. Child has ever received. Personally, the low ratings stimulated my curiosity to the point where I had to purchase the book just to see for myself the depths to which the author and his popular character have sunk.<br /><br />Fortunately, within the first few chapters I received the reassurance that neither Lee Child nor Jack Reacher have lost their touch. Ever observant and with an uncanny ability to figure other people out, Reacher did not disappoint. As with every other Lee Child book I've read, this one kept me up until I finished it.<br /><br />So why the negative reviews? Read a few of them and you begin to smell sour grapes. Could it be that fans disappointed that Tom Cruise will play Reacher on the big screen are willing to throw a skilled author and one of their favorite characters under the bus?<br /><br />I too was disappointed that Tom Cruise will play Reacher, I had always imagined Vin Diesel in the role. But everyone knows how Hollywood works. Many movies created from books barely resemble their source. That is why the question--which did you like better, the movie or the book?--is so frequently heard.<br /><br />My advice to potential readers is to forget the noise, read the book, and decide for yourself. I'm glad I did.
B004TI5N38|4.0|David continues to write an exciting and entertaining mystery novel. his characters are always believable and he weaves them in and out of finger biting experiences.
0446556750|4.0|I liked this book.  I didn't guess the ending which is always a big downer for me with other authors.  The story did have more courtroom procedure to the plot, but that could be assumed with the title of 'The Reversal.'  I liked the characters.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN stars a persistent Kristen Stewart, a continuously morphing Charlize Theron, and a stalwart Chris Hemsworth hoisting an ax in lieu of a hammer.  All together I found them a likable cast for this surprisingly complex and detailed version of Snow White, which, as I suspect is true for most people, I knew primarily through the Disney cartoon.  I detected a faint visual echo of Disney's Evil Queen when Theron's Ravenna immerses herself in the milk bath,and we see her frighteningly perfect visage surrounded by a pure white akin to the Disney Queen's severe cape collar.  But this film is much more epic in feel and scale, more serious, darker, and certainly more feminist.  The sets vary from unpleasant-- the Dark Forest, Queen Ravenna's decaying castle-- to strangely beautiful-- the rocky sea cliff where Snow White finds her horse and the revelatory waterfall scene with the White Hart. (Actually, that scene, although hyperreal and very pleasing to the eye, has a moment where the seer says to the Huntsman \\"she is the one,\\" and I flashed back, I'm sure inappropriately, to Keanu Reeves as Neo in the Matrix, another One.)  In this Snow White Stewart portrays a reluctant, kind-hearted heroine summoned to battle by necessity.  The screenplay seems to want us to sympathize with Ravenna by supplying a cruel backstory:  poverty, a jilting in love she has never recovered from, and an unwished-for power, but that Ravenna does not seem to sit comfortably with the fully evil acts she perpetrates with no sense of remorse.  Theron does well with the mixed messages of the script and on some level it seems it hardly matters:  the costumes, like the sets, are detailed, imaginative, and it's great to see non-kitschy, non-Monty Python Medieval/Renaissance fashions and images.  Stewart has a definite style, breathy and restrained, always looking as though something is going on at the back of her mind.  And Chris Hemsworth, probably knowingly, bumbles around likably!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it's a fun little time waster.  you can get plenty of stuff without spending real money. but if you're impatient you can spend some and speed things up
B0087HT36U|5.0|HTC rezound. I'm not sure why everybody is having problems with this game. I haven't noticed any of the issues I've read about in other reviews. I haven't seen any ads, there is no lag or delay between. this is a fun game, different from what I usually get but still fun.
0307716511|4.0|I truly liked the story of an older sister trying to find out the reason behind her younger sister's disappearance.  As an older sister I could identify with the main character from the start.  I liked the way the author wrote the story as if it was a journal. The ending was not predicted...which are always the best!

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The lameness is not  in the hpypothesis that aliens somehow aided humans evolution, but in the manner it was presented, worthy of a B-Movie. The aliens seeding Earth with life having their DNAdisperse in a river? A rough star map thousands of years old exactly matching some group of stars somewhere not visible with naked eye? Stars move, you know! And why would they point at a desolate planet where the mismatched crew found a bioweapon cache base? And of could theDNA human and of the engineers match oerfectly after thousands of years?<br />The crew sent by a geezer tycoon who believes the \\"Creators\\" engineers will give him immortality (?) is composed by one utterly amoral robot who finds a strangge black goo in one capsule and proceeds to put that goo in the drink of a crew  member for an experiment and a mismatched, bumbling crew. Two of said crew map the tunnels in an alien \\"pyramid\\", then get lost, encounter a pool of the black goo from wich a nasty looking snake thing emerges, and try to make friends with it. Disaster obviously ensues, in a movie best called Alien Reloaded.The engineers' ship is identical to the one in Alien, and after a thousand years of inactivity it functions perfectly with stunning holographic effect, maintaining one of the Engineers in stasis. When they manage to reawaken him, he acts like Godzilla, killing everyone in sight and setting the ship to go to Earth to destroy humanity. Why? Maybe we`ll know in the sequel, after ship collisions, horrid surgical operations, giants Chtulhu things that grow from smallcalamari to gigantic squid a few hours without food who conveniently manage to engulf and mouth rape the mad Engineer.The only survivor then takes the other ship she learned to fly God knows how to search for the real Engineer planet. I`ve seen Star Trek episodes far more plausible and mind challenging than this drivel.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|A wonderful film, not just for UFC/fight fans. This movie reaches out to a much larger audience than what you may expect. Definitely worth five stars.
B0072N4PD6|5.0|The book contains explanations and guided meditations to enhance your intuition and other psychic abilities. I'm glad I read it.

0553386794|5.0|A great fantasy series that is actually well written. Martin delves into each character, allowing readers to feel like they know the characters' feelings, thoughts and motivations. The only problem with this paperback is that the plastic lining that is glued to the paper cover starts peeling away easily.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|The movie starts with Snow White's mom wishing for a baby, pricks her finger and BAM next thing you know, she has a baby.  Fortunately for the actress who played the mom, she was killed off early so she won't be associated with this film.  Unfortunately for us, the baby grows up to be Kristen Stewart.  The king falls in lust with Charlize Theron who promptly kills the putz and puts Snow in a tower where Snow saves herself with a nail after her bird friend shows it to her.  Yes, you read that right--a nail and a bird.<br /><br />The movie missed on so many levels.  The plot was barely plausible and so many people or things were introduced and then killed.  The magic mirror was even downgraded to a large shield that morphed into a blob.<br /><br />For Pete's sake, could we not see more of Chris Helmsworth's body?  Where and what this \\"light\\" that Snow White had that everyone commented on?  Why were we subjected to Kristen's poor acting?  I found myself cheering on Ravenna (Charlize Theron) to kill Snow in one of the last scenes.  Gosh, put everyone out of their misery and kill her.<br /><br />I'm tempted to write the producers and demand my $4.99 rental from cable.
B008Y2IU12|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. With all of the negative hype that it received (in part I believe because of the scandal), this film in general has received too many negative votes in the original release comments section.<br /><br />The Evil Queen's role and acting was the top. I enjoyed her as a villainess. She pulled it off well. I also liked some of the minor characters. The visual effects were outstanding.<br /><br />Yes, this was a darker plot, but the screenplay was good--my only complaint is where exactly the ending happened in the story, but still, that is a very small complaint.<br /><br />If anything, support the crew who made this show--I believe that their talents shined through on this one. Everything from sound to the colorist.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Very similar to Angry Birds, but better.  Don't have to worry about the slingshot not working or the level being too hard, this game is better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm a former BlackBerry user and a fan of the raised key QWERTY keyboard.  So imagine the nightmare of trying to get used to a virtual touchscreen key board.  I've recently joined the 21st century and switched to the Android platform.  The only drawback was the \\"standard\\" touch screen keyboard and its error prone sensitive keys. If I hadn't come across Swiftkey 3, I would have gotten rid of my phone after day one!<br />  Swiftkey 3 is a must have for people who care about spelling, syntax, and time.  The system not only suggests the next word, it learns and predicts your next word!  I have typed in as little as two words and Swiftkey 3 completed my text with the exact \\"suggested next word(s)\\" by simply selecting the \\"highlighted\\" word, which is correctly spelled. I would definately give them six stars if it were an available rating.<br />  By the way, the 30 day free trial is an excellent hook.  You'll try it, fall in love, and within the first hour, you'll purchase the standard app!
B007X4ECMI|4.0|This movie is what it was meant to be, fun.  Guy Pierce was excellent as was Maggie Grace.  The movie moved quickly and was filled with clever fun.  I really liked Lockout and I think you will too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I have it on my kindle fire and despite all the negative reviews, I've never had any problems. definitely worth a download!

B005LAIHPE|4.0|This movie was fun and filled with a lot of creative special effects and good acting, for the most part.  I feel Rihanna should not have been cast in this film.  Every scene she was in she either ruined or slowed down, a lot.  This however is my only complaint because, despite tanking at the box office, Battleship was a really good movie.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Angry birds, but catapoulting rocks, bombs, and potions into the castles of Vikings, Samurai, and Pirates instead of pigs. Oh my!  Easier to target precisely. Birds and pigs get tiresome after a while. Siege Hero is a nice change up with a better targeting system. Imo
0547569653|2.0|I admire Jurek's running achievements and the way he treats his body (I am not vegan or even vegetarian, but glad to see the proof that somebody can reach the very top of his sport without resorting to anything artificial, let alone illegal).<br /><br />What disappointed me was that he came across as a completely self-centered, self-aggrandizing, single minded person. It didn't feel like he had any fun running or purpose in life other than winning another race.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I laughed out loud several times!!! Such a great feel good movie. Rachel McAdams is adorable, and there was just enough romance with her love interest. Diane Keaton is so funny, and Harrison Ford is so grumpy and cute. See it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|installed this app at least a month ago and it works great.  no problems with overheating or not charging.  I like the app and use it several times a week.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I've read all the books, and especially loved the first one while having mixed feelings about the other two.  So I approached the movie with trepidation, as let's face it, movies are almost always never as good as the book.  And that holds true for this one, although I can deifnitely see how it would appeal to those that took no interest in the book itself.<br /><br />Katniss is a girl from the twelvth district of Panem, a country that has a shining Capitol city and twelve districts that are somewhat poorer and supply different necessities to the Capitol.  To keep her family alive, Katniss illegally hunts in the forest with her friend Gale to provide food and other things they need.  But this year, at the Reaping, in which a girl and boy from each district are picked to go to the Hunger Games ( a brutal contest that is a fight to the death, with only one left alive), her sister Primrose is picked to be a contestant.  In a selfless moment, Katniss offers herself up as a volunteer to save her sister.  As she and Peeta (the boy who was picked) head to the Capitol, she knows that she has a minimal chance of staying alive, but she has to do whatever is in her power to survive the games.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Jennifer Lawrence: Katniss Everdeen<br />Josh Hutcherson: Peeta Mellark<br />Liam Hemsworth: Gale Hawthorne<br />Woody Harrelson: Haymitch Abernathy<br />Elizabeth Banks:  Effie Trinket<br />Lenny Kravitz:  Cinna<br />Stanley Tucci:  Caesar Flickerman<br />Donald Sutherland:  President Snow[...]<br /><br />I think they did a great job at picked all the different actors and actresses for this moment.  Katniss is a little stoic as played by Jennifer Lawrence, but considering her character isn't very touchy feely anyway, it seems appropriate.  Peeta I found nice, certainly Hutcherson is easy on the eyes, but I just didn't get that shining personality from him like I do through the books.  Gale is also pretty to look at it, but again, the personality just doesn't shine through.  That being said there are several characters who do have a wonderful effect on screen.  Woody Harrelson as Haymitch I thought was perfectly done.  He really seemed just like the character from the books.  And Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, oh my, I have to say I didn't even realize it was him at first and I think I fell a little bit in love with him from his first few minutes on screen.  He was that appealing.  And when I discovered it was Kravitz later, I just couldn't believe it.<br /><br />The plot for the most part follows the book, and for those who haven't read the book it still is easy to tell what's going on.  Although there are a few things that only people who've read the book would understand.  And that's fine, as it adds a certain element for them.  But there are a lot of areas it strays from the book, and like usual, that's disappointing.  Like with the dogs, there are certain things about them in the book that didn't carry through to hear, and I think it would have been simple enough to make them stay the same that way without needing to take too much time to develop it.  So small things like that.  It will be interesting to see if the sequels to the movie follow the other two books though.  I would hope that they would for the most part as Collins wrote a good series, and there's a lot of detail that is important.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty good in this movie.  Especially those involving fire.  I did like that they tried to capture Collins vision with \\"The Girl on Fire\\" and incorporate it into the movie.  Other effects, like the dogs, weren't quite as well done but luckily they weren't in as much of the movie and the better special effects were more predominant.  I do need to point out that ultimately there is a lot of death in both the book and the novel, and it is captured to an extent on the screen itself.  So be prepared for violence, and blood, and tough subjects. The music was good, but nothing special and it actually wasn't until the ending credits that I really took the time to appreciate the music.  It was just filler during the movie itself.  But the songs played during the credits were nice.<br /><br />Good movie, just wish it had had more elements that make it true to the book.  I will eagerly wait to see the next one.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012he music.  It was just filler during the movie itself.  But the songs played during the credits were nice.

B007JNR4XW|5.0|This was received extremely quick, and was packaged very well. If you haven't seen the movie you need to, especially with Channing Tatum in it. He's worth watching if for no other reason. It really is a Great Movie. Check it out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh, how much I loved this book.  There really are not words to describe the way this book made me feel.  It was pretty much amazing.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus...what do you say about them?  They are fictional characters, but they are amazingly well penned out fictional characters.  I loved Hazel.  She was strong and funny and sarcastic.  I really enjoyed being inside her head.  She was so young but seemed so old, trying to just get through to the end without causing too much trouble.  Augustus was the opposite.  He was trying not to be forgotten.  I loved his character, his jokes, his way of looking at life.<br /><br />You know going it that this book is going to be a tear-jerker, and even though you've prepared yourself for it, it still hits you like you were living it...like you were living with them.  The characters were amazingly life-like.  You can't help falling in love with them, feeling joy and happiness for them, feeling pain and sadness for them.  I loved that the author was able to put so much depth and feeling into his book and open the reader's eyes to the ups and downs of other people's lives.  Is this book really realistic?  I have no clue.  But to me, it was close enough.

B006O2QNOU|4.0|I am not going to summarize the plot. The acting is reason alone to watch this. Kevin Spacey carries this film at the end. It's not overly exciting, but it is a good example of what actors can do with confined space and timeline. It's not boring like I thought it would be.

B00846REIS|1.0|I must admit that I am not a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey, although I read the first one. When I purchased this book, I had no idea that not only is it the same genre - it's the same book. The author has changed the names and places, etc., but it's the same story with the same \\"cast of characters\\". The only differences are that her roommate is now a gay man, instead of a woman; she stumbles into Mr. Rich and Handsome on the day she's scoping out her new office building instead of interviewing him (but she falls down on the ground just like in Grey); different city ... There's even the older woman lurking in the background causing much angst and jealousy. Don't waste your time on this one, folks. It's trash. I certainly didn't finish it. If I was the author of Fifty Shades, I might consider suing for plagiarism.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|This book is all a bit contrived for me and pretty much \\"floats around\\" for most of the time. The early Reacher novels were better than the current one and it looks like the writer has tired a bit and is just coasting. A great pity as the earlier books were full of interest and action and twists. Good enough read but just not the \\"zip\\" of the earlier ones<br /><br />mdf
0307951529|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think that this book compliments the Four Hour Work Week, which has more nuts and bolts. The many stories (I wouldn't quite say case studies, due to the lack of depth of detail), provided ideas and proof of other's success. I particularly liked the story of the Marketing consultant who, without formal/previous experience, was able to set up and run a successful marketing consultancy practice.<br />I can see why some reviewers called the book fluff due to its lack of specific techniques or practices (unlike 4HWW), and furthermore, the promised forum or other additional resources at the companion site were not there, except for 4 pdf templates.<br />Nonetheless, the book is an inspirational tome and prod to change your way of thinking which is what, I suspect, was the author's intention. There are other books that provide the nuts & Bolts such as 4HWW and Personal MBA, and of course, nothing substitutes talking to, and associating with real-life entrepreneurs.<br />Good luck to all you potential startups and if anyone knows where I can find that forum and other mentioned resources, please do let me know!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is very fin and mesmerizing at the same time. I am new to this game bit I still want to learn how to master the game  I just hope this rating on this game isn't too premature at this time because alawar games sometimes get hung  up and kicks you out of game play.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game! If I were to tell you people what I don't like about it would be that sometimes when you want to jump or slide it might not sense it. Other than that there is nothing wrong with this app. I recommend this app. Get this app!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I wasn't sure about whaT To expect.  I am pleasantly surprised with this film.  Cinematography was fabulous.  Dramatically different twists from the fairy tale, but they worked very well.  Don't try to compare to the fairy tale.  This is Snow White fro an alternate universe.  LOL.  I think it was very well done and will become a classic.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really do enjoy this game. I do not recommend the other Angry Bird versions (like the Seasons) for beginners because those need a lot of skills and even for a master (like me) it is too hard. The original Angry Birds is right in the middle&hellip; Anyway I really like this app and it works perfectly fine on the kindle fire.
0930289234|5.0|watchmen is fully compact and beautifully illustrated. I read two pages a day, its like sitting in a movie,like being part of the action. I call it my dessert. I read it when I want to relax and just enjoy reading. its just plain fun to read.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]<br /><br />Having read every single Jack Reacher book, I couldn't wait for this book to come out!  I started reading it as soon as I woke up on September 11th, but was sadly disappointed.  Page after page was BORING!  How much can you really say about the roads and gas stations in Iowa anyway?  And for the first time ever, I didn't even like the plot, if there really even was one.  I found the story line confusing and lacking, to say the least.  I really didn't even want to give this One Star.  A Big Fat Zero from a Dedicated Reacher Fan would be more like it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My family's first and best blu-ray disc set. This movie means everything to me and my dad. We have most of the original books, and saw the movie in theaters. It was the best movie I've seen this year, even up against Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises. It was fun and family-friendly without being too kiddie or simple.<br /><br />The graphics are incredible. All that 3d technology paid off because all the Green Martians and the stunts look perfect even when you look at them singularly. Taylor Kitsch has not been getting enough credit as an actor because this is his best performance so far and he probably isn't going to get nominated for anything.<br /><br />The main problem was marketing. Everyone knows that. Nobody really understood what they were watching because they haven't read the books or even knew it was based on a book. I understand that it seemed unrealistic to most people. But, to say they never explained anything is BS. Dejah Thoris, the babe of the movie and head scientist of her whole damn species, talked to John about why he was here after the Air-flyer fight scene that John cut in of. She commented on his bone density and how that could explain why he could jump so high. So, it did not happen for no reason. And at the end, John said himself that he didn't know why he stopped aging or started aging so slowly. Just because they didn't spell everything out or you doesn't mean it's not explained. Just like a good show by Steven Moffat (writer for Doctor Who and Sherlock), \\"If you can't understand it, then your probably just too stupid.\\"<br /><br />The makeup and costumes were better than anything I have seen in a long time. The tattoos on the Red Martians were tasteful without being gaudy. The characters were in fact as good as or better than they were in the book. John Carter was largely portrayed as a jarhead-type who fought or took orders more than he talked his way out of things. Stanton's John Carter is smart, witty-even. Dejah Thoris is a beautiful princess who shows her smarts and fighting skills more than her sexuality, but that doesn't mean she didn't look good in that Zodangan wedding dress. If we followed the book version of John Carter, then she actually would have outshined John in the movie. Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas worked out the best way it could have. It's Willem Dafoe after all. In my personal opinion, the best scenes were with James Purefoy as Kantos Kan (John Carter's future best friend).<br /><br />The blu-ray extra content ties everything together nicely. The bonus scenes are probably what should have been used in the movie if Disney hadn't demand clip cuts to fit the allotted movie time for 3d configuration. This is by far, the best-looking blu-ray I've seen. John Carter is a movie that really shows what blu-ray can do. Instead of looking so real that it scares you, it thrills you.<br /><br />Not only do I endorse the excessive renting or purchasing of this product, but I vote for a sequel (come on, John Carter has like 11 books written) and a re-release in theaters as a director's cut with all the bonus material. That'll show em'.<br /><br />SAVE WOOLA!

B005LAIHPY|3.0|These days I tend to rent from Amazon before I add to my limited shelf space.  I still find that Blu-ray gives a better experience than downloading off the net.  I knew the director's work and from the ads, I was pretty sure that this would be a movie I would watch from time to time if I put it on my self.  Now that I own it, I probably will watch it again with friends who haven't seen it.  It has the great special effects you would expect these days, and the Blu-ray is crystal clear with great sound, but, the story just didn't develop and move for me.  It's not terrible, but, not great.  Just a 3.  I should have rented it; I doubt I'll get the 5 plays to justify the purchase.
B004ZP37HE|3.0|I think the season wasn't as good as others, however, it definitely kept me entertained and interested in the story line. I don't understand how one can really complain? What more can you expect from a show? It's a great show, it's different than any other show out there. I'm very happy this show is still going and the story line, as complex as it may be, keeps you wanting more!!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|True Kristen stewart wasn't the best in this movie and yeah yeah movie was dark but what were you expecting the dwarfs and snow white to start singing and running around like complete idiots or what?

Overall it was a good movie good plot not the best cast but it was still a good movie.

068485743X|4.0|If you have limited time and treasure your freedom -- movement of hands -- this little book provides a trove of writing tools.<br />Each advice requires a book for elaborations and a life journey to master.<br />I encourage all writers; fiction, non-fiction, corporate, personal; to spend sometimes reading up this book and use it as the first sign post to master English writing; although the principles applied to writing in other languages.<br /><br />Some salient points:<br />1. There are no rules to assure great writing, but there are ways to avoid bad writing.<br /><br />2. Ultimately, the only person who can teach you about writing is yourself.<br /><br />3. There is a lot of advice in this book; some you might use, some you might disagree with.<br /><br />4. The art of writing cannot be taught, but the craft of writing can. No one can teach you how to tap inspiration, how to gain vision and sensibility, but you can be taught to write lucidly, to present what you say in the most articulate and forceful way.<br /><br />5. The better editors worry if entire sentences should be switched within paragraphs; great editors keep entire paragraph -- even pages -- in their head and worry if these might be switched.<br /><br />6. Your creativity should be expressed through your writing, not your font.<br /><br />7. The agents read a brand-name novelist's work with an eye for liking it, actively looks for reasons why it's good, and perhaps even blinds himself to its faults; the unknown writer's manuscript, however, will be ready by an angry, overworked editorial assistant, one hoping to be able to find the tines fault so he can get it out of the way and move on to the next five thousand manuscripts.<br /><br />8. Use your advance research and be specific. A better way of catching an agent's eye is to tell him right off that you noticed he agented a specific title and that your manuscript is similar. An agent will appreciate that you've gone to the trouble, that you care; hewill feel the submission is personalized and not part of a mass mailing,<br /><br />9. The point is not to advocate the spending of money but to advocate the greater expenditure of personalized care.<br /><br />On adjective and adverbs.<br /><br />10. An adjective is a word used to modify a noun and an adverb is a word used to modify a verb.<br /><br />11. The more specific you can be in writing, the better.<br /><br />12. In general, when you're torn as to which adjective to give up, scan the text to see if you might convey one of the ideas elsewhere.<br /><br />On Sound of the writing.<br /><br />13. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, to that he avoids all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. - William Strunk and E.B. White, the Elements of Style.<br /><br />Use of punctuation.<br /><br />14. The semicolon should be used to connect two (or more) sentences or ideas that are distinct but closely related. These two (or more) sentences should not be so similar that they warrant being merged (with, say a comma and a conjunction) and yet they should also not be distinct enough to be separated (by a full stop).<br /><br />15. The colon should be used then you want to offset a point clearly It can also be used to replace the phrase \\"that is\\".<br /><br />16. The dash denoted an afterthought. Parentheses serve almost the same purpose as pairs of dashes. They are more formal than dishes, and are often used to imply an afterthought.<br /><br />17. In general, a sound problem is difficult to fix yourself because, since you were the one who wrote the words, they will most likely \\"sound\\" fine when you read them back. Also, you already know your sentences by heart (or at least well) and so will not scrutinize then upon a further sad but, rather, mentally fill in the gaps.<br /><br />18. Aim for complexity of thoughts, not expression. Even if your sentence sounds great, always ask yourself if its meaning is clear for the reader.<br /><br />19. If you stay on this track you will eventually find yourself reading as much for sound as you do for content. It's like listening to a song: do you listen for the melody or the words?<br /><br />On comparison.<br /><br />20. A simile is the likening of two things, generally by using the words \\"like\\" or \\"as\\", which, however different, have some strong point of resemblances.<br /><br />21. A metaphor is a comparison which is implied but not formally expressed. A short simile. Thus, \\"That mean is like a fox\\" is a simile, but \\"that man is a fox\\" is a metaphor.<br /><br />22. If a writer doesn't care enough about his work to paint precisely the right picture, why should the reader wasted his time reading it?<br /><br />23. Comparison is a major tool, not to be used lightly or frequently.<br /><br />24. Just as there is a world of differences between a word that is right and a word that is perfect, there is likewise a world of difference between a comparison that works and a comparison the brings the reader to a new level of enlightenment.<br /><br />25. Specificity is what distinguishes poor from good from brilliant writing.<br /><br />26. We must remember that reading is as much about education as it is entertainment, and even small flourishes can help serve this function and add a whole new dimension to a text.<br /><br />27. \\"I'm not saying you should learn big words to impress readers; I'm saying you should learn big words to increase your arsenal as a writer.\\"<br /><br />28. When you begin to learn a foreign language, if you try thinking r tailing in that language, you'll find you can only construct limited sentences, using basic words. The same holds true for English. If you know only basic words, you can only construct basic sentences -- after all, what are sentences but compilations of words? Most of us stop actively trying to increase our vocabulary after secondary school or university. This is a huge mistake, particularly for writers.<br /><br />29. Never us a word in your writing you are not first intimately familiar with, that you do not use routinely in real life. Otherwise, it immediately ting false.<br /><br />30. The writer who holds the dictionary in his head will often opt for a word of sup rising brevity.<br /><br />31. To make your own, use it not only in speech, but in your thoughts. After several weeks of usage, it will be a word you can use fluently. Then, and only then may you use it in your writing.<br /><br />32. Don't let yourself use cliched comparisons, and make sure each one is truly enlightening.<br /><br />33. Dialogue is a powerful tool, to be used sparingly, effectively, and at the right moment.<br /><br />35. In writing, the journey is the destination.<br /><br />36. Evoke the mood by the description, not by telling us what the mood is.<br /><br />37. What's interesting to you may not be to someone else.<br /><br />38.Reread great works of literature, carefully observing how various writers handle characterisation and character description.<br /><br />39. Stamina, endurance, and concentration, which must be built into the writer.<br /><br />40. Usually how the writer views the reader is just a projection of how he views himself. The more confident he becomes about his own abilities, the more confident he become about the reader's, so aain the solution is to focus on building your own confidence as a writer.<br /><br />41. Will a reader want to read your book twice? Three or more times? If not, why not? If so, what will he gain from an additional reading?<br /><br />42. Sound has to do mainly with the basic construction of the sentence--its flow, its rhythm-- and is more of a technical issue; style also has to do with sentence construction, but has more toso with the intention behind the construction,and thus is as much an artistic issue as a grammatical one. Tone, has nothing whatsoever to do with construction or grammar -- rather, it as solely to do with intention. Sound, style, and tone are related in that they all work jointly to affect the overall melody of a piece,; but tone sits n the opposite end of the spectrum from sound, with style falling somewhere in between.<br /><br />43. One must remember that a book is about its characters, not the writer.<br /><br />44. The edit principle is this: no matter ow good the writing , if it does not further the intention or progression of the work, it must be cut.<br /><br />45. If your manuscript progresses too neatly, is too rigid, too perfect, then you've overdone the focusing and need to allow some room for spontaneity, digression.<br /><br />46. A setting will become more real if it unfolds slowly. Settings are also like characters, in that the reader can only make mental room for so many, and you do't want to press him to memorise more than needed be.<br /><br />47. Good settings are distinguished from great settings in that the former will name details, but the latter will go one step further and use these details to make an impression. An example of good setting:\\"It was a small, dark room, poorly lit and airless.\\" An example of a great setting:\\"It was oppressive, like a tomb\\".
0307744434|4.0|A game between two sides. It starts with a 6 year old girl. Sent to Prospero after her mother passes. Her father sees so much potential in her he calls the man in the grey suit. This is how the game begins. Celia knows she will be pitted against an opponent but she has no idea who that person might be or when the game shall begin.<br /><br />I rather enjoyed the story. I thought it was told wonderfully and it was just as magical listening to the events being played out as it would have been to be there. I could picture it as clear as day. That being said the narrator's female voices were terrible. I was cringing most of the time. His accents were good but he should just stop trying to do women voices. It also seemed as though most of the characters sounded the same as well as him slipping in and out of character.<br /><br />I rather felt like I missed something. When did they fall in love? How did they fall in love? What was Marco doing? I felt that even though everything came together that poor Isabelle was stuck in the middle.<br /><br />The game was likened to a chess game with the circus and the people being the pieces. I think this book will appeal to men and women. Who wouldn't want to visit this circus.<br /><br />Even though it appears as though there are characters that are not important or just taking up space, they all have a purpose in the story. All the way down the the ticket holder at the end. It was a wonderful tale beautifully told.

B000MCIBN4|3.0|I've always loved this album, even more than A Trick Of The Tail. I've only ever had it on vinyl, & being a fan of SACD I thought I'd like on that format. Well I'm afraid it's a disappointment. I'm a sound engineer (& musician) by trade so I'm particularly sensitive to how music sounds, frequency response etc. While the SACD layer of this hybrid disc sounds better than the cd, as you would expect, in a straight A/B comparison with the vinyl copy, both are inferior. The remastering job has simply turned up the high tops but most offendingly, the upper midrange, so it's unpleasant to listen to. The vinyl doesn't sound dull, it sounds spacious & right, whereas the digital remasterings just sound hard & bright.<br /><br />  Of course if you've never heard a good vinyl pressing or don't have a halfway decent turntable, you won't know the difference. But if you do, find a good copy of Wind & Wuthering on vinyl. It'll sound superior. Don't waste your money on the digital version is my advice. Some remaster jobs are great, this isn't.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's hard for me to put into words what Wool is like.<br /><br />The first two parts I had the image of a complex knot, slowly being picked at and unraveled. That's what the silo is like. You begin, like the characters, with a very small and dim view of reality.<br /><br />Slowly, more of the story unfolds, more characters come and go, and you become a part of the story.<br /><br />I truly believe that this series is one of the best reads I've had in years. I've been impressed, moved, and even inspired. It can be a dark read, but is utterly worth it.<br /><br />I would suggest ANYBODY read this book.
030758836X|5.0|I had read Gillian Flynn's previous novel \\"Dark Places\\" and enjoyed it quite a bit. But in her latest book \\"Gone Girl\\", she definitely takes her craft up a notch. It is simply one of the best books I've read in a while, certainly the best this year.<br /><br />It remains amazing how Flynn came make you care or at least be interested in what happens to her regularly unlikeable characters.  In short, make the unlikeable, likeable.  The novel contains the requisite great mystery and twists that make it a jaw dropping page-turner but what continues to set Flynn apart from other mystery-crime authors of the day is her wonderful prose and character introspection.  She delves into not only the how but also the why.  The book is as much a mystery as a study on relationships and society mores.  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone even if its not your usual genre.
B0090EIILU|4.0|Went in thinking this wouldn't be hood, maybe a few laughs. Usually a movie  like this all the funny things are on the commercials. Was I wrong! We watched on the plane ony fire and were laughing so hard the whole way, people were looking at us funny. Really a pretty good movie, the plot wasn't even that bad. If you like tosh or mencia type humor, watch this movie!

B0061S073A|5.0|With this app I don't have to worry about all the ads on my kids apps.  They cannot be activated.  The kids know how to find ALL of their apps, because they are collected in one place, and they can maneuver around from app to app without messing around with my own apps.  Great for them, great for me, and no interruptions from stupid ads.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|My review is about the blu-ray.  Other reviewers assume that there is no difference between the live performances, the HD simulcasts, and the blu-ray set.  As a  result, the question concerning technology in the production itself, the use of video projection, triggered by the singers rather than \\"pre-shot,\\" to use Lepage's word, and the cinematic nature of much of staging, not just the 43 plank \\"machine\\" Lepage invented, is entirely missed.  If you watch the blu-ray, you are watching a film of a production meant to be seen, eventually, on film.  I admire this production for thinking about cinema without entirely thinking it through.  I know that sounds ridiculous.  All I can say is read [[ASIN:1844673448 In Search of Wagner (Radical Thinkers)]] There you will find a trenchant analysis of Wagner's own interest in technology and phantasmagoria, or what were then the equivalent of special effects. (See, for example: \\"\\"And it is precisely the religious Parsifal that makes use of the film-like technique of scene-transformation that marks the climax of this dialectic: the magic work of art dreams its complete antithesis, the mechanical work of it.\\"<br />Theodor Adorno, In Search of Wagner, 109).\\" Lepage is a brilliant special effects filmmaker who nevertheless imagines that technology is something that exists apart from live performance, that one can use in the service of live performance rather than dictate what happens in live performance. As a technology that has invaded, as it were, Lepage's production from the start and to which it is also destined form the start, film is not secondary but primary.  It is much like Alberich's ring.  Lepage has made a Faustian bargain, if I may call up a different opera based on a different legend, with cinema. But the blu-ray is definitely worth the price of admission.  This blu-ray set is by far and way the most watchable of all filmed productions of the Ring.  The camerawork and editing are so good you don't even notice them. And this blu-ray is technically superior in terms of sound and image quality as well.  It has moved the bar up many, may steps.  Levine's Rheingold and Walkure is stunning.  So is the singing and the acting.  I have never seen a better filmed opera delivered to blu-ray, including other blu-ray releases of Met HD simulcasts.  If you are interested in the way Wagner's leitmotif method of composition became the template for Hollywood cinema soundtracks, many of them composed by German and Austrian emigres, you will be especially interested in the way this blu-ray ends up, no doubt unintentionally, turning the music into an incredibly amazing film soundtrack.  See  [[ASIN:0826499023 Composing for the Films (Continuum Impacts)]]  This blu-ray is an historic event.  By all means, see it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The layers of sound you can create make it so natural..... unlike simple white noise apps these sounds have an ebb and flow -- and layers of sound! -- more true to life,  making them sound so realistic &amp; relaxing.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|To think I looked forward to reading this dribble for over a month.  Lee Child's worse effort. A tremendous disappointment.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app is more than a convenience.  I can *do* more with my life than before because Calengoo allows me to keep it all organized. I'm spending more time with my kids, I've said \\"yes\\" to volunteer opportunities, and I'm much more peaceful and happy.  It's changing the way I manage and live my life. I've been dreaming wistfully of something like this for years!!!  This is my stand-alone everything app.... multiple calenders, reminders, lists, alarms all in one gorgeous, adaptable, do-whatever-you-want-with-it app!!!  Be sure you sync regularly because it did crash on me once and I had to uninstall and start again from scratch.... but I didn't lose any info because I just re-synced to Google Cal.  It took me a long time to configure colors, sizes, etc because it's a little tricky to figure out and has a gazillion options.  I can view multiple calendars (viewing at any time all, one, or some), and choose how to have it notify me: pop-up, alarm, speaking text, email, sms.  It can do all forms of the reminders at once (I don't have to choose between the options), with repeat and snooze options, and have as many reminders as I want it to send me.  I can  \\"check-off\\" both the to-do items and the calendar items, and have them become shaded, crossed out, or disappear altogether.  I can color-code calendars and individual entries so I can see at a glance what I'm looking for.  Be careful because some things appear not to work right, but it just requires adjustment under the many options which take some experimenting with.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|The story of Camille Preaker a journalist, who is urged by her Editor to return to her home town of Wind Gap to cover a series of child murders. Camille is reluctant to return to a home and town that she had fled from many years ago. Camille is to outward appearances a beautiful and successful woman. But Camille has her own secrets that she wishes to stay hidden from the world. Camille has no wish to return to her past and during the course of this story it quickly becomes apparent why.<br /><br />This book is a fast paced and well written psychological thriller. It deals with the subject of child abuse and the effects on family dynamics. The book also highlighted the closed, claustrophobic small town mentality where information is hard to come by and any outsider stands out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />I found the ending to be somewhat implausible regarding some of the characters and am unable to say anything further without giving the ending away. Still, it was a very good book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|ive looked for months for an app that would do what evernote does.... I use it for diary entries and its perfect

The layers of sound and the natural ebb-and-flow to the different sounds mean you can build yourself an endless variety of realistic, natural, relaxing ackground noises. Sooooo much better than other apps of it's kind!!!!!!

B004LQI0HE|5.0|The fictional state depicted in this film is as fascistic and cruel as the Third Reich. It angered me profoundly, and set me to wondering why the poor clones didn't rise up and destroy their heartless oppressors. I then got to wondering how an educated people could approve of a program that raised people as \\"organ-cattle\\". And finally, imagining myself a clone in such a society, I decided it would be preferable to destroy oneself than to passively accept a role as an involuntary walking organ bank. In any event, the clones were going to die at the hands of the ghoulish doctors and nurses who were taking the clones vital organs for the benefit of unknown recipients.<br />My heart went out to the clones. Who or what in hell gave such a society the power of life and death over these poor helpless creatures? And what Godless philosophy was it that decided that clones didn't have souls? Charlotte Rampling's performance as the truly heartless and souless mendacious head mistress of the boarding school was good. I hated her character.<br /><br />On another note, the cinematography was superb and truly evoked a mood of dark despair.<br /><br />I recommend this film as a thought provoking instrument on a topic that is timely.
B0072HDP9M|5.0|This is a wonderful, heartwarming novel about friendship, love and the trials of life. Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe has become one of my favourite reads! It was written beautifully and I loved each of the characters. This story took me on a journey and I found myself chuckling aloud and reading whole chapters to my mother, who likewise was enthralled.  I am sure that I will read it over and over again. Highly recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the whole Hunger Game Series; in Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins does a fantastic job giving all aspects of the story a good closing.  Highly recommend the book, can't wait for the next movie following the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  I'm on this all the time.  I agree with some of the other reviews, sometimes it does take a long time to load the pics., but I just thought it was my Internet...  Still love it though.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A movie with a consistent moral story of the importance of fathers in the lives of their children especially teaching by example.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Uploaded without a hitch, storyline is ok, you do need to leave a review to go on in the story but that is a small price to pay for free game. Don't you think?
B008Y2IU12|2.0|Charlize Theron was visually brilliant as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth was, well, Chris Hemsworth, wonderful visually and acting - the movie could have been about the two of them and been fantastic, but no, they had to have Kristin Stewart play Snow White... correct me if I am wrong, but I don't remember the character being a vacuous twit who appears to want to catch flies with her constantly opened-mouth expressionless face.  Gawd, she was awful.  It even feels as if the film has been cut to try to eliminate as many scenes with her as possible... they didn't eliminate enough.
B008LZYR0A|5.0|Yes, for all the Petheads out there, simply buy this single CD for some most wonderful B-Sides!  I'm utterly impressed with the touching, tender rendering of Bee Gee's \\"I Started a JOke,\\" and the experimental, beautifully haunting \\"The Way Through the Woods,\\" which again proves the Boys' astounding talent and consistently being ahead of time.  Bravo again to the Boys, for blessing us fans with these fabulous jewels!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put the books down. Many nights of little sleep because I lost track of time because the book is so wonderful. The story made me forget about everything else I was supposed to be doing. I read at night, breaks at work, waiting for something to start. I took my ereader everywhere so I could read it at any possible free moment. Love this book. The Author should keep going with the books or write ones similar.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|The album with mostly midtempo numbers may not be a dance album most of the PSB fans are used to (with the exception like \\"A Face Like That,\\" which in my opinion is trademark PSB dance number at their best), but a great one nonetheless.  The ambience and the moods just grow on you.  Another gem from their fabulous career.  Have been in love with their music since the beginning, and still am.  Long live the Boys~~

B004OBZMBS|4.0|Civilization has advanced to the point that Norway has decided to throw itself into the hand held camera, \\"it's real!\\" cinema. The film starts out with bear hunters claiming a man named \\"Hans\\" (Otto Jespersen) is poaching bears. Three college kids follow him around with a camera. Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud) is the leader. Johanna (Johanna Mørck) carries around the boom mike. Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen) is the little heard, less seen man behind the camera.<br /><br />Eventually the saga gets to the point where they find out Hans is a Troll Hunter. He allows them to film him as they travel the rainy countryside. What is different about this film as compared to its American counterparts is that you don't have to wait until the last two frames of the picture to see the monster/entity. The film has continuity to it and is presented in a simple chronological order. The English dubs are large white easy to read letters from a people of few words. I liked how they incorporated aspects of troll legend into the film. A good film for those who like the hand held camera cinema. I obtained my copy at Walmart for $7.50.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.
B008XG1X18|4.0|works most of the time. I have only had it force close a few times. love pinterest so I'm glad vere is an app. use it on my phone and kindle fire.
B0095T3H2U|4.0|This is an interesting hit and miss romantic comedy aka \\"chick flick.\\" Tom (Jason Segel) is a chef in San Francisco who is engaged to Violet (Emily Blunt) a Brit. They meet at a costume New Year Eves party and don't worry if you miss it, they replay it (definite chick flick giveaway).<br /><br />In a role reversal, he gives up his career so she can do her doctorate studies at the University of Michigan for a couple of years. They put off getting married while Michigan turns Tom into Grizzly Adams. Meanwhile Susan (Alison Brie) who is Violet's sister gets married to the somewhat crude Alex (Chris Pratt) a friend and co-worker of Tom.<br /><br />The humor moves from clever to awkward to bad. There is a doughnut metaphor that starts in the middle of the film, that has moments of cleverness. The extreme overreaction of the main characters due to minor difficulties is perhaps the downfall of the film. While the film needed to create conflict, it did so in an inane manner that was neither funny nor realistic. Emily Blunt gives us a good performance.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, male rear nudity (Jason Segel...another chick flick giveaway) 3 1/2 stars on the girl's film scale. Pale in comparison to \\"Bridesmaids.\\"

B0087HT36U|5.0|nice graphics nice aiming feature. sometimes it drags the scrren instead of shooting but very addictive game. Miniclip like allways delivers the goods.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|For anyone who loves history and is spellbound by the origins of places and people, this is the novel for you.  The book is written like a James Michner epilogue, starting with the beginnings of an island overrun by invaders and settles us into the building of the town of London.  We experience its growing pains, classes and traditions.  I give this novel four stars.
0425263908|1.0|This book was a major disappointment.  I read the Fifty Shades series and loved it.  This was like reading a copycat version, but one that couldn't hold a candle to Fifty Shades.  The guy is incredibly rich, good looking and hung like a horse, and she is beautiful and intelligent just like Fifty.  She falls in front of him and that is how they meet, in a building that he owns of course.  I kept thinking, can you come up with anything original?  Bared, just doesn't have the delicious tension that Fifty has. Bottom line, save your money and don't buy this cheap imitation of Fify Shades.
B0072KZ0Z6|3.0|Zooey Deschanel shines as bright as a thousand lightbulbs in this quirky freshman comedy about a weird bunch of roommates living in a loft in LA (yup, one of those) BUT she is the highlight of most of the episodes and completely outshines her counterparts. I may be alone in this but I don't find any of the male leads to be relatable or even truly likable. I do like Jess's (Deschanel) friend CeCe, and even though she doesn't always deliver on the acting front, she's got her looks going for her at all time (yup, she's pretty hot).<br /><br />The storylines are fresh and new and something that we haven't seen on other shows for the most part. While that is generally a good thing they don't always manage to be interesting and compelling. Some episodes therefore fail to entertain and come off as flat out boring.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'll admit it's cute and kinda charming and certainly worth checking out, but doesn't quite live up to the hype due to the lack of direction in its story lines and character development of the guys!
1844137864|5.0|It is impressive how prolific this collection of work is.  It is entertaining, humorous, rebellious, deeply moving and inspiring all at the same time.  I guess I could simply say this is art.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Well acted, good story, but the theme is a bit of a downer and you have to understand that when you watch this movie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|i read the book and the reviews. I have read all of  Childs books and sincerely believe this story and plot are as well written as any of his novels. He is a brilliant writer and kept me engrossed to the finale. Its very easy to criticize any book and easy to find flaws in them but I can only praise his originality. his plot structure, and his hard work.
B0085A9J18|4.0|Just finished watching the Raid, great flick. Decent swat team movements and gun play. Very strong, fast paced, acl tearing, neck breaking fight sequences. Happy to add to collection. Will watch several times.
B0087HT36U|4.0|nice but takes the idea of angry birds. Rovio might need to sue miniclip.com for sure. the only thing that sets it apart is the angle.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|This second volume was in many ways predictable but like the first book, although there was much repetition of ideas, scenarios and language it managed to keep enough new material coming to hold the reader's interest.<br /><br />Difficult to put down.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have the kindle fire and downloaded this app a couple of weeks ago. when it works, it is so awesome, and way faster than the mobile version. it is easier to repin things, and I love the way the search is set il on here. however, it doesn't always work the first time I try to load it. usually I get a message saying that the app isn't responding. I choose to close it and try again. then it usually works. overall, I love it, though.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|this app WAS my best app until the so called resent &quot;update &quot;. it asked me if I want an update I click&quot;yes&quot; and it takes me to the original place were I downloaded the app and it has no link no button or anything to give me the &quot;update&quot; it WAS working perfectly and all I ask is for the company to fix this small problem please do I'm sure everyone would appreciate it.
B00846REIS|5.0|After finishing the notorious Fifty, a friend brought Bared to my attention. I was ensnared from the start and finished it in a day.  I spent every free second I had with my kindle.  The story is naughty and will leave you squirming in your seat.  I loved Gideons rake like appearance and devil may care attitude.  It had the demeanor of a regency romance with all the filthy f***ery of our darling boy fifty. I cant wait to see how the story evolves between Gideon and Eva and learn more about their past, there is still so much more to find out about Gideon and oct cant come soon enough for me.  If you enjoyed fifty you cant help but be taken in by Bared. True they are similar in style but Day brings a different style of debauchery to the table.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|While admittedly I did not care for the first 20 minutes of the movie (it took that long for me to warm up to changes from the books) I was completely engaged by the end and eager for a sequel. I read and thoroughly enjoyed the entire Martian Chronicles series as a boy and have always been content with a limited collection of the books in paperback, but found myself in search of the missing volumes of my current collection with a renewed interest in reading the entire series again. Now my son is even interested in the books, even after knowing they were originally published nearly 100 years ago.<br /><br />Well done Disney.... First movie I have actually gone to the theater to see in over 10 years and was happy to pay the 3D price to see this classic. (Though I possibly would have been happier with the 2D movie experience.)
B00006AW2G|5.0|I recently purchased this CD (2002 Abcko Records). I'm not a sound expert, but if it sounds good to me on my car CD player I'm good. It plays nicely on my computer. I recently read Keith's autobiography \\"Life\\" and started reminiscing about that time period when I was 15 or so and a huge Stone's fan. I stopped listening to the Stones after Exile on Main Street (The Best). I did not care for Goat's Head Soup. Now I can't stop listening to the late 60s, early 70s Stones and remembering how great they really were/are including the contribution they made to music. Bringing American rhythm and blues back to Americans.
0062107062|5.0|This book was a great read and provides many insights not only into the American Sniper, but also into Navy Seals and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Definitely worth your while if you are interested in the topics listed above.
B004AQR24W|3.0|Full cast of all your favorite badass testosterone overloaded actors, plenty of graphic violence, explosions, unbelievable odds and good fight scenes.  And the ladies get to enjoy Jason Statham in all his goodness (this might be his best picture). What more could you ask for?  (Ok, perhaps a little better STORY).<br /><br />Stallone is a bit hard to look at in this one, and age takes it's toll on everyone - but while he's the \\"star\\" in this, he gets his butt handed to him a time or two in this one, so I appreciate that much realism to the story at least.<br /><br />Typical testosterone movie, but if you're in the mood for one, chances are good you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />What would it have taken to get me to give it a better rating? More personality and intelligence. They didn't win by being smarter/craftier - they won with a lot of balls, weapons and sheer luck. But if you just want action - this will provide.
B0087HT36U|3.0|I like this game except that it is a copy of. angry birds. its not worth a dollar. I do however like that that u just get to shoot your weapon in stead of sling shot.
0156027321|5.0|Read it !! It will take your breath away at the end , don't read to many reviews about the book as the last pages make the entire book worth it , not sure how they will make it into a movie but I'll be sure to see it

They dont have a free version yet but the full is way better!<br /><br />The game play is amazing but i do wish it had spawn eggs, paintings, signs, and fire. i know they took fire out because of a glitch but then there is no reason for TNT. Please add these things and i will be the happiest Minecrafter ever!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Mockingjay. My granddaughter got me started on the series and it gave us many things to talk about. The ending was a surprise to me and a little disappointing but for her the ending was perfect.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|Although I love this series and have gone on to watch season 2, one of the DVDs I bought through Amazon was defective. It skipped a huge part of both episodes that were on it from the first time I watched it. Unfortunate and annoying, but I figured I'd just return it and get a nondefective one, right? Except for the fact that it's now discontinued. So what I'm assuming is usually a great product, I guess I got a bad batch and now can't do anything about it =(
B001ANYDAO|2.0|Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is a tale about the causes of success. The book reads like a novel peppered with interesting tid-bits. The problem with many of his arguments is that they are too simplistic, often sensationalistic and unfounded. To economists or data analysts, \\"Outliers\\" feels like a case of literary curve fitting gone awry. Let me briefly outline point by point, how, many of the ideas of the book are simplistic.<br /><br />1. The book writes extensively about how successful people were successful because they happened to be in the right place at the right time. This argument is repeated over and over throughout the book. There is no real insight in saying that Bill Gates would not have created Microsoft if he was not a pioneer in the world of computer programming.<br /><br />2. The book emphasizes how successful people work very hard at perfecting their crafts. Yet again this argument is quite straightforward: effort is rewarded and there are no easy victories.<br /><br />3. Gladwell introduces a series of example on how arbitrary policies affect people's probability of success. For example he explains how the deadlines inherent in the selection process of junior hockey players create abnormal distributions of professional hockey player's birthday. In a mind numbing simplistic way, he then repeats over and over that hockey would have twice as many great players if the selection process was more equitable. That is a fallacy because changing the selection process would make one's birthday irrelevant to one's likelihood of being drafted but would not change the number of exceptional players because the overall number of selected players would not change, and the size of the pool from which they are selected would not change.<br /><br />4. The latter half of the book is disappointing. Gladwell makes a dubious and unconvincing case that Asians are better at math because they cultivated rice fields instead of wheat. The chapter is painful to read becauseit falls in many cultural stereotypes that have no basis whatsoever. Medieval europeans are depicted as lazy, unintelligent farmers with no ambitions. While Asian societies' particularities are exalted for being industrious and virtuous. What is bothersome with his arguments is its lack of any historical foundation. It is a poor act of curve shifting: making the data fit the narrative. Many economists have pointed out that yesterday's lazy people become virtuous and vice versa based on their contemporary economic performance (in \\"Free to Choose\\" Milton Friedman contrasts various depictions of asian cultures before and after the recent economic performance of various asian countries).<br /><br />5. All of the arguments of the book are support with very few credible sources. The few arguments that are supported by academic sources are lopsided (the one study that justifies a whole theory).<br /><br />Overall this is book is poorly written with very weak arguments.
B00005JMCN|4.0|What a great classic horse race movie that starts before the horse was born and shows the from the bottom start of the owner. Great faimly feel good movie!
0307913090|2.0|I loved this book. It is fascinating, enthralling and totally well-written.<br />It is a must-read book for those who appreciate great literature.<br />Being a Harry Potter fan, I recommend this book to like-minded bookworms.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love Angry Birds, but it is much better without the ads getting in the way.  Definitely get the ad - free version if you have a choice.
1594135851|4.0|Having enjoyed the first book in the trilogy I was eager to get these last two.  I'm about halfway through \\"Catching Fire\\" and it's no disappointment.  I can't help but note some similarities between the government here, the \\"Capitol\\", and what now passes for our own US government.  It's a little unnerving.  But for this book itself, it's enjoyable reading and goes quickly as you're kept interested.  If you read and liked \\"Hunger Games\\" you'll almost certainly enjoy this one as well. There was one surprise - it's a large-print edition and I must have missed that in the description.  But, hey, it means I can read it without my usual reading glasses!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I have more fun playing this game than Angry Birds.  Works great on my Toshiba Excite 10 inch tablet. Thanks for a fun game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love this series and love being able to download it off the intertnet rather than waiting.  nice price and convenient
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book right now i am working on atching fire and it is so hard to put these books down
030746363X|4.0|It is important to read the introduction and the first few chapters.  After that, it makes more sense to browse looking for specific areas of interest.  Overall, a very good book with ample instruction and advice.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This has been the first time in a LONG time I've gotten a game app (or ANY app, for that manner) without checking the Reviews first (there wasn't one review posted yet when I downloaded it).  I have THAT much faith in Big Fish Games. U TRULY feel like a detective - hell, it even had the \\"evidence wall\\" u c on many cop shows (usually seen on a wipe-off board).  I like how the map provided shows you places u need to go to next (it shows a red exclamation point on the place that has an \\"action available.\\"  -& when u finish that action, & there are no immediate actions left to choose from, (u also have a notebook to help with other things needed 2b done).  The book has 3 sections, I think?  And guess what?  The ending was just as good, & when it said, \\"to be continued...\\"  I was so happy that this format will be used again!<br />Whenever u're unsure of what to do next, hit 'Hint.'  There's no penalty, so use all the hints u want!  (There's also a harder level that gives u less info finding objects & locations & longer time between hints, so it's great to replay on that level- if u're up to it...).  By the 2nd half of the story, there will be so many actions available, u rarely need the hints for anything except if u need help with the hidden objects (which are great to play  because u can zoom in).<br />If u like Hidden Object games & detective games, U'll LOVE this!  oh, btw, there are some scary parts that jump out on you- not many, but just enough that when u finally feel comfortable enough checking out the town, BAM!  --And the video clips in the game?  Excellent graphics.<br />After playing mostly every HO game out for the Kindle Fire, this is rt up there with the Empress games.  Those may also be Big Fish HO games where u search diff. places in a certain location, but that's where the similarities end.  Hope u enjoy it as much as I am (I'm on my 2nd run-through now...
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very easy read. Moves quickly and story flows. One of my new favorite authors after<br />not liking earlier books about Camel Club.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|yeah, ok, once or twice it didn't guess characters from new TV shows, BUT compared to all the other ones guessed rt?  From TV, books, music.... he'll guess it!<br />What freaked me out was after trying 2 stump it for days with actors & TV/movie/book novel characters, along with sports stars,  I decided to try a singer (the home screen tells u to choose a character, real or fictional. I didn't consider musicians \\"characters\\" although they can act like them... :-/  So, after asking the first question (if my character was m or f), his second question was asking if he was a singer.  Are u KIDDING me?  The one time I \\"change it up,\\" I get a question I had NEVER gotten yet!  Why then?  THAT creeper me out!  I cant wait to show my friends & family this!<br />But Elokence,  there are 2 things I hope u can fix- well, not 'fix' but update:  the few rare times I DID stump the genie, u asked me to write who it was I had in mind, & after I typed the character's name, there was no 'enter' button (the arrow on the Kindle Fire wasn't there, so I couldn't 'tell' you)... the next part would be way to save certain \\"details\\" -I love how u can read over the q's & a's bet. u & the genie, but, once u begin a new round the prev. deets r gone!  And there are some I'd like to save to show people how fast genie guessed it w/the amt. (& type) of questions asked!<br />btw,  I'm calling him \\"genie\\" instead of the \\"Akinator\\" because it reminds me too much of Clay Aiken, & that is truly unsettling.  NOT a fan (sorry) , but I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS APP! It's so good it's creepy!<br />keep updating & adding!
B00011CZRE|1.0|Do NOT buy the 2004 [[ASIN:B00011CZRE Seven (Single Disc Edition)]], for several reasons.<br /><br />First, the disc is single layer, not dual layer like most DVDs. What this means is that half way through the film, the film will stop, and you will have to eject the disc, flip it over, and insert it back into the DVD player. Strike one.<br /><br />Next, the product description says it is anamorphic widescreen. It is NOT by any stretch of the imagination. The copy I received was letterbox. What this this means is that although you will receive the film in its original aspect ratio, the film had to be matted in order to fit your vintage 4:3 TV screen. So for those of us who own modern, 16:9 televisions, you will see those black bars along the top (which is normal), AND along the sides. Basically you'll be looking at a picture within a picture. It is NOT anamorphic. If any of this is confusing to you, please spend some time on wikipedia learning about it; it will pay off in the long run.<br /><br />Lastly, the transfer to DVD is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a poorer transfer than this. It looks like it was copied from a bad VHS version. There was a constant grainy distortion on the left side of the picture the entire time. The sound is old and muffled. The picture quality was awful.<br /><br />Despite all this, I did notice that there are several other DVD versions available aside from this cheap version I picked up. I like this film enough that I will need to pick it up eventually, so I'll try perhaps the 2 disc version, or just go straight for the Blu-ray, presuming the transfer from the analog went smoothly.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Been several years since I have seen this movie.  It did not disappoint.  Had my adult daughter watch it and she enjoyed it as well.  Wonderful movie and good acting.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|That is terrible that they need all of those permissions so I can take some notes... Most games don't  need that many permissions. Spyware!
0945001193|5.0|Actualy i did not read the book yet but for me as a son of holocost second genetion its very interesing to read how a person become a monster full of haterred to others but unfortunately is was extreme among all other people who hain power by deploying this dark and absurd thinking
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is really fun to play and I like it myself! I think it is so fun that everyone that has a kindle fire should get this!
0061692042|2.0|I kept waiting for the \\" hook \\" that would catapult my interest in the story and confirm my initial perception that this book would be intriguing. I had a nagging feeling to check the reviews and get some inspiration to continue. Alas some reviews mirrored my feelings so I put it down and saved myself some time and frustratrion.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I really like this app because I could download any video but now it wont let me watch it before I download it and it wont let me download anything now. I have Internet connection but it wont download.  Why?
0385344333|1.0|I agree with Reacher Creature. I kept waiting for the book to get better. I literally skipped pages, especially towards the end. And I couldn't get a picture of the Reacher that I loved into my head. I always pictured Jim Caviezel, who plays John Reese in the CBS crime thriller Person of Interest as Reacher,not little Tommy Cruise. That's it for me. Hope Reacher finds what he's looking for in Virginia. I sure didn't find what I was looking for in Wanted Man.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book caught my eye with the cover and the more I read the more I wanted to know what was going to happen. The suspense is great and I plan on reading all of them.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was an excellent season! Great writing, great acting. The end is so intense. And the fact that they play into a religious atmosphere is very intriguing.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|good game really has depth for ipod type game. lots of fun but tryst too hard for real money upgrades are to hard to get
B0086700CM|5.0|very addictive and fun! but it is making me stay up too late at night! Can not beat it for free.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I've been a Ken Follett fan for years, reading his later works.  I recently bought both \\"Triple\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle\\" for my Kindle and couldn't put it down!  Follett takes great care to provide historical background that makes his tales so plausible - and Triple in particular is a case in point.  The character development is well paced so you end up being emotionally engrossed in the story line.  Although Triple was written long ago its story line is so relevant today.  Enjoy!!
B00338QENI|5.0|I am absolutely amazed that it occurred and thank Rebecca Skloot for her time and energy in putting this story to paper.  Well done!  I had no idea that this had happened.  What a wonderful legacy Henrietta left her family and the world. The Lacks family should feel very good about how this book was written, and what it says about their family. This book is a MUST read!
0395645662|4.0|Pretty good! Needed It for school and ordered it used for cheap, Got sometime(s) later! Although the book its self was in Good condition, the shipping bag was TERRIBLE, It had looked like someone ran over it with an airplane! But Im not reviewing the bag Im reviewing the book! no pages ripped, No Writing, Scratches, Ok cover, Pretty Good indeed.
0618918248|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was well thought out and written. I was already atheist going into it but his eloquent arguments gave me more conviction to stand up for knowledge and rationality instead of tip toeing around religion in the name of respect.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wouldn't say it's every woman's dream.  I'm glad that Anastasia told him what she did and didn't like and I like the fact that he was willing to listen and be flexible.  The other woman never challenged him.  The fact that he's already see a psychiatrist is a good thing.
B000076CY6|4.0|For $39.99 the set was a good price. The inclusion of four mini-figures, more than 300 bricks, and several unique bricks made the purchase worth the price. If I have made the set the only thing I would have changed is that I would have excluded one of the Mordor Orcs and included Saruman.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|The life proof case is great! Does its job, considering I dropped my phone on asphalt and not a scratch- not even on the case! Durable!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Good quality and works great!! Plug and play. Noticeably quicker than the best 802.11n connection. Wish list: a link/activity LED
B0085776BG|4.0|While there were several historically inaccurate details, the special effects on blu-ray was incredible. The Tuskegee story is one that should be told but I wish Hollywood would be more authentic and leave out some of the fluff. But to just watch and enjoy the great cinematic panorama was a delightful break.
B0063GORYU|5.0|if you have a kindle fire, thisvis a great app to get. Its doesnt need internet and its easily addictive
B008XG1X18|4.0|Glad they created a mobile app. No issues so far. Would like to be able to search other users. I wish I could sort the boards I follow to hide dome of them when I am out in public.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it offers lists of fun and makes you work to accomplish everything you can do in this game. you will not be dissapointed if you download this game
B0012NVGHU|3.0|I purchased this movie because the Broadway play \\"Once the Musical\\" received 8 Tony awards.<br />I have tickets to see it and wanted some background. Let me say that I have always preferred live musicals as opposed to cinematic musicals.<br />That said it was just ok for me. Luckily the price was right.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fun read, a little over the top but captivated my interest. These 3 books are definitely out of the main stream of best sellers, can't wait to see what happens in the fourth book as the third book left the reader with many unanswered questions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Keeps you on your toes, you never know what is going to happen next.  What a page turner, I couldnt put it down. Read all Three in less than two weeks.
B0090X4J9G|5.0|The episode of Pretty Little Liars was great.  This was my first time using Amazon to watch a TV show and I loved it.  I had no clocking, it loaded up right away.  I would highly recommend.
B005HSL626|4.0|So would eliminating all the in-game offers to \\"connect\\" with friends.<br /><br />After dismissing all the full-screen ads, I thought the \\"dojo\\" was the place to go. Turns out it was \\"new game,\\" except I didn't realize you were supposed to avoid slashing bombs. After a few times failing to get the idea, I gave up.<br /><br />EDIT: I managed to find the instructions that talk about the bombs. Turns out this is a pretty good relaxation game, especially in Zen mode. The constant nagging about OpenFeint is annoying, but at least I don't have to turn it on to play the game. I must also say that the in-game ads aren't as random as in other games; rather, they are targeted to players of this specific game, which is refreshing.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|My husband and I watched season 1 on Netflix in just a few evenings. We were devastated that Season 2 was not available . . . until we realized that it was available from Amazon. We joined Amazon Prime expressly to watch the second season. Now we are eagerly anticipating Season 3.<br /><br />Downton Abby is a wonderful show to watch with your children. My daughter is studying 20th century history and DA has provided a very interesting perspective of WWI, not to mention class issues and women's rights.

B0015AARJI|1.0|So I purchased this ps3 controller back in May, it's now September.  I understand that ps3 controllers take some time to break in, and feel as comfortable in your hand as your old controller, since all controllers are a bit different and take some getting used to.  This one, has had 120 hours of playtime in Battlefield 3 alone, and is horrible.  L1 works about 80% of the time, and then when you're able to aim down the sights, even though you've got it pressed down it will zoom back out on you every other time.  The right thumbstick doesn't really work honestly.  There is no ability to fine tune your aim, you have to push the thumbstick all the way in the direction you want to go for it to be recognized, which tends to make your aim very sporadic and impossible to control.  I've adjusted the sensitivity level from very low to very high, and just about every place in between, in a variety of games to no avail.  Unbelievably disappointed with this sale, wish I could get my money back for it.  I waited 4 months to write this review to give this controller every shot at working, but no matter what game I play or what settings I try, when the L1 button and right thumbstick doesn't work, it's impossible to play again.  I've had three or four friends try it out on their systems with some similar games, and they have the same results.
B008XG1X18|1.0|i love pinterest but... this app sucks!! i hate that everytime i open the app it force closes itself &amp; i have to open it 2-4 additional times just to use it... PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
0316056863|1.0|I found this book very hard to read and lost interest quickly.  It uses a lot of vulgarity and is demeaning.  I really like tina fey on tv and talk shows but this book was dissapointing.  Glad i picked it up at the library instead of buying it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game!  It is so fun to play!  The secret files are cool and so are the hidden levels!  You should really get this app if you love Where's My Water!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|'Fifty Shades of Grey' is the female version of 'Letters to Penthouse.'  Sex is that threshold between intellect and instinct.  It is the age old delimma of how one coexists with your instinctual desires and your logical judgement.  'Fifty Shades of Grey' is an expression of ones instinctual sexual desires through voyeurism.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|awesome game! lots of fun and mentally stimulating. the hints option really helps as well! really worth the time and cost.
B0061S073A|4.0|I use this on my 8yo's tablet to keep her from downloading junk. It works great! but minus 1 star because the resolution doesn't look right on a Skypad Alpha 2.
B005L38QK2|2.0|I owned a Razer Imperator, but bought this because it purports to have the various keys already macroed to Diablo III skills.  It's a nice looking mouse and fit my hands (medium-sized woman) very well.  I returned it, however, because in the end it wasn't as comfortable as the Razer, especially in the thumb area, and I didn't find the thumb hotkeys to be as easy to use.  It did, as advertized, come with bindings to the Diablo III skills but is easy enough to bind them to other gaming mice.
0937381888|4.0|this should probably be your first book you get when you get into home brewing. it has all the nuts and bolts, and how to do pretty much everything. i even did my first all grain batches (both a brew in a bag and mash tun) based off info from this. it really is the bible of home brewing. i will give this a 4/5 as some of the instructions and such are a bit arcane and not very well explained. and, alot of the all grain chapter is predicated upon having your water analyzed, and adjusting for the style. i think that perhaps gordon strong's approach may be superior, to start with RO water and just add some salts from there. the formulas presented were helpful, and if you use online calculators based on these, you can calculate infusion and decoction amounts and temps to get your rests. but again, unless you have a degree in mathematics or are a programmer, not very user friendly. the recipes in the back were good examples, but i think that the author could have introduced some other recipes to give a representative beer of each style, and perhaps not give multiple pilsner recipes instead. but, i suppose you do have to cater to the masses. also, more discussion about yeast, and perhaps adding something about hopping and souring techniques would be a good addition to the bible of homebrewing. overall, a must have. my copy may even need replaced, as it has been splashed and fizzed upon and everything else.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Worked great at first then, an upgrade box would pop up and would take me to app store and now is a waste of space.
B0087HT36U|2.0|The app is good for 1-2 levels before crashing.<br /><br />The game play is similar to angry birds and enjoyable, when it works.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Michael Douglas is amazing in this film , It tells a powerful message about society in a twisted and funny way.I think everyone should see this movie at least once.Twenty years later I still rate it 5 stars.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|bought for my nephews birthday he loved the DVD an i LOVED the price, new DVD no scratches or marks wrapped in plastic it came with bonus things on the dvd (the other dvd he got didnt have) so it separated the two similar gifts. A+. SHipped super fast!
0345803485|1.0|Okay, so I get that this started out as Twilight Fan Fiction, and I seriously *TRIED* to overlook that, I did, and I read all of book one and two before coming to the conclusion:  THIS SUCKS!  I could literally parallel everything that happened in these books to the Twilight books.  Sexy hero who is unattainable?  Check.  Sexy hero who is \\"unable\\" to stay away from heroine?  Check.  Sexy hero saves said heroine repeatedly and usually from her clumsy self?  Check. Heroine has a low self-esteem and chews her bottom lip too much?  Check.  Sexy hero has sexy and rich family?  Check.  Even Alice is paralleled!  Seriously, I couldn't stomach the third book at all.  It all boils down to horrible, juvenile writing, and an author in serious need of a thesaurus.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I bought it. watched it. I love the movie. It's amazing. I bought it HD, but I guess my connection was low, because I only paid for the regular. But still. I'd recommend.
0307592731|5.0|Strayed writes from the heart - simply and elegantly, and without any fear. So starkly painful are some of the passages, that I found myself having to put \\"Wild\\" down and take a breather before continuing. But, like the author as she finishes her trek, the reader will feel better and stronger after reading this book. I'd say it could be today's \\"On the Road\\", but Strayed's memoir is in fact better than Kerouac's.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Awesome game. Would definitely reccomend to my friends. Hope they keep making games like this. Keep up the good work.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest so much! it serves as the perfect distraction as usual. The kindle version has a very nice, clean layout. definitely would recommend.

0307744434|4.0|I enjoyed Erin Morgenstern's debut novel, The Night Circus.  I asked for the book for Christmas because Erin wrote the first draft of her novel during NaNoWriMo several years ago, and I am a supporter of NaNoWriMo.  It took me a little while to get into the book simply because I had to keep going back to the chapter title page to see what year I was in.  However, after I firmly established what characters were in what timeline, the read became easier.  Erin did a wonderful job of creating realistic characters within a fantasy/supernatural context.  I loved that even though her characters were in control of so much surrounding them, they were still bound to the realities of human existence.  It's was a delightful read, and a good book to curl up with on a rainy day!
B00000K0E5|5.0|Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is bungee jumping off the top of a massive dam.  He fires a dart with a cable attached to it and it pulls him all the way down to the bottom so he can get free.  He uses a laser to cut through an access plate. He knocks out a guard and enters the kitchen storage area inside a Russian base.  He meets 006, Alec Trevelyan) there and they enter into a laboratory and a storage tanks and prep area for large scale production of chemical weapons.  Alex, 006, is captured and shot in the head.  James hides behind canisters of lethal chemical weapons gas.  James starts a conveyor belt and dumps hundreds of tanks of chemicals onto the soldiers.  James jumps after an empty rolling plane as it drives over a cliff.  He free falls into the plane without a parachute and recovers from the dive and escapes. The weapons plant explodes as he flies away.<br /><br /> Many years later, Bond is driving to Monte Carlo and racing a woman in a red sports car.  She is Xenia Onatop who is a criminal member of a crime syndicate.  They are side by side on very dangerous and curvy roads.  Xenia is playing cards in the casino and Bond and her get into a betting contest and James takes all of her money on the second bet.  Xenia is from Russia and she is an ex-Soviet fighter pilot.<br /><br />Xenia is in a relationship with a Canadian Admiral and she murders him that night.  General Ourumov takes the Admiral's place in order to gain access to a naval event held the next day.  It is a demonstration of a new helicopter that can withstand an EMP pulse and survive.  Xenia and Ourumov steal the helicopter at the event. They fly the new tiger stealth helicopter to Russia where they attack a satellite control bunker and steal the control for the Goldeneye satellite secret weapon.....<br /><br />This is a high tech action 007 movie and the first 007 movie done by Pierce Brosnan.  He breathed a breath of new life into the James bond movies again.  This movie features a good cast as have most James bond movies and the high tech special effects of the weapon make the movie seem realistic.  I liked this move a lot and Pierce makes a good Bond with a younger and newer style of action and storyline.  I recommend this movie to you as a good one.ost James bond movies and the high tech special effects of the weapon make the movie seem realistic.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm so glad I can finally I can play this game without having to look around the ads. Great game and very addicting.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Seriously, unintertained to the extent that I closed the browser. Honestly, though I've stopped watching a movie from lack of interest before, it's never been this bad. Also, the first forty minutes did not start up any comprehensible plot.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I think this book is well written albeit repetitive in it's subject.  I don't think I will be reading the 3rd in the series becuz I have gotten a sexual overload from the first two.  But I MIGHT read it just to see if the author makes more of a story and to see if \\"Fifty\\" turns into a \\"normal\\" person.
B0087HT36U|2.0|It would have been better if it wouldn't lock up every other level. A little more work on the program before releasing it would have been nice.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|In line with 61 Hours and Worth Dying For, A Wanted Man found Reacher not at his best. Like the others, this was a good read, just not what us Reacher fans have come to expect out of Lee Child. It started off slow and never really picked up speed until the very end, leaving me waiting for that classic Reacher action that I've come to love from these books. Following the casting disappointment for the upcoming movie, this was not a time to let the fans down with a mediocre story.<br /><br />All of that being said, I'll still be on the lookout for the next in this series, in hopes that this is just a build up to better things.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fantastic game! !! I have nplayed almost all the hidden object games on the kindle fire, and this is the best so far. you have an evidence wall, a map that shows you where the activity is and if you need it the hint button will show you where to go. I have played almost all of the Big Fish games and this is the best one yet, can't wait for # 2 !!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|excellent app easy to u derstand let's. you know battery charge time and what you can do with the power you have
B0083GQVOC|5.0|Good and disturbing movie. The actor who played the mother was outstanding. The direction made the movie disturbing but it matched the subject matter. This should have won an academy award.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|i calibrated the phone, but for some reason it thinks I have a HTC glacier instead of a myTouch 4G . after calibrating , it still shows as partially calibrated . and of course it does not show the usage for 4G since it's still thinks this phone is a glacier . Other than that , it gives me every breakdown for every app on the phone that uses battery life . graphics are good and you can also display battery percentage your notification bar . i may look into the paid version , if they can identify my my touch 4G phone .
B0086700CM|4.0|It lags on occasion but never bad enough to make me die. Overall I really like it and it can be very addicting.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like this book better than the first book.  I hope the third book continues to get better. Saw an elementary student wearing a gray tie the other day for a presentation and had to laugh.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|This speculative biopic of the controversial FBI director stars Leonardo DiCaprio. As the story opens, Hoover is dictating his history of the Bureau; in flashbacks we see his pivotal role the Lindburgh case and his battles with Communists, the Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Martin Luther King, Jr.  He was also obsessed with his doting mother (Judi Dench) and his long-time Assistant Director, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer).<br /><br />The story is, in turns, exciting and boring, heartfelt and cheesy and has two insurmountable flaws: DiCaprio is horribly miscast as Hoover (he still looks and sounds like boyish Jack Dawson, despite supposedly aging 53 years) and the old-age make-up used for Hoover, Tolson, and Hoover's secretary (Naomi Watts) is absolutely terrible.  Tolson, in particular, looks like Boris Karloff's Mummy and even though director Eastwood filmed the entire movie in dim, half-light, the make-up is distracting and never convincing.<br /><br />I found the story of Hoover's life interesting and came away feeling quite sorry for this sad, tortured man, but the casting and make-up ruined it for me.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does a great job for my Kindle Fire. The app is not too intrusive while the battery level info is readily available.  The voice notification is great. It's free too! !
B006FE83UE|5.0|The 50th Anniversary edition was such a wonderful surprise! Not only for the movie itself being one of the all time classiics but the extra bonus features were outstanding! Seeing cast members recall making the movie, interviews with Gregory Peck, details of the production are such a delight to watch! Highly recomend!
1936608898|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read! It makes you challenge everything you've ever been told about healthy diets. Melissa and Dallas explain the 'science-y' part so that anyone can understand. If you're open to reassign your relationship with food and are ready to feel amazing 100% of the time, read his book!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I actually love this game for one very good reason the gameplay is actually responsive compared to some other touch screen games I'm looking at you angry birds.
B000W1SSV0|5.0|I have several Stan Getz CD's and enjoy his work. I only recently heard a song from this CD while listening to Pandora and loved the piece; it was amazing. The CD is instrumental and soothing, but yet jazzy and energizing enough that it will not make you drowsy. After listening to Jazz Samba multiple times I knew that this was one of my all time favorites. Amazingly, Getz followed this work up with Jazz Samba Encore which is equally as good. If you enjoy jazz and want to add a little latin jazz this is a must have CD.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use my son's kindle for this app,  and its great.  The first time I used it,  I could not believe the many different choices I had in sounds. they all work so well, and they are all so soothing.  I recommend this app to anyone who needs a great  sleep. Goodnight!! :))
B007HGPBRC|4.0|This is an honest and raw journey of one man's knowledge that he has a short time to live. Nothing saccharine and no self-pity with quite a few good questions about religion and what happens after death. Dark humor, I smiled and laughed. It was amazing to me he could still see the humor ... first in the treatment with all the horrid side effects, and then accepting of how little time remained.<br /><br />Chris was well educated and respected in literary circles and that comes through as well. He kept up his book tour throughout the final months ... that is described in detail that might be tough. He kept up the writing of this book as well as he was not able to finish it prior to his death. His wife wrote the last chapter.<br /><br />The other thing that he didn't do (as opposed to Last Lecture) was try to say how people should live. There is no preaching, or self-righteousness, or discovered answers about life. Only questions, lots of them. And those will stay with me for some time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting premise for a novel.  The title readies you for a murder mystery and then things become more complicated.  The reader wants to believe in the husband's innocence but through the use of the wife's diary the reader is conflicted.  As the story unfolds the mystery is,made deeper through the description of the husband's Missouri home town and the hard times it has fallen on.  The denouement is interesting and surprising.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Great way to kill time. Makes very cool designs and the more contact you have on the screen the more points of gravity for even more variety. Great app!
030758836X|1.0|This book got great reviews and I made myself finish it. No one was believable. While the author was able to create tension, it got to the point where I didn't care because the characters were all so unlikable.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|I placed the order on 14 Sep 2012 and the shipment didnt send until today I want to know why
B00884GR0W|5.0|essentially like minecraft but In my opinion is better. it focuses on more magic and fighting instead of surviving.a few glitches but it has potential
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am enjoying this game a lot!!so many places to go and I love the zombie aspect. looks great on my fire.
B0087HT36U|3.0|this game is an okay game. its a lot like angry birds. very similar, but it is a little different.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Works great.  Just enough grip to be secure in hand yet slide in and out of packet easily.  Screen protector was easy to apply.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Nice graphics fluid controls for a touch screen and free.  So i say get it cause why not. Again free.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I ordered the series on DVD, of \\"Friends\\", on August 15th,and never got it!!!!  Now I have to wait for them to investigate, and then maybe get my money back.  It was supposed to be a birthday gift from my son to myself!!  Happy Birthday to me, huh?????
B004UID2LC|4.0|I really enjoyed this app; it is great. instead of wasting money u get to download videos for free! but when u watch online Hq if u play it to end ur device says that it is unresponsive. love it thought totaaly worth the 0.00! ha lol
B0087HT36U|5.0|It's a good game for all ages to play. My kids love this game, and the are ages 5 to 11. I love this game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|slow begining i liked mags a lot but its sad she has to die because of katniss peeta rocks! ya
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob's never been more haunting and telling. The years have not been kind to his voice and his outlook, but it all comes through like a breath of fresh air somehow. Maybe all the previous years were builting to this period where all caution is throw by the wayside and no target is beyond his reach. His anger clearly is geared to the one percenters and the pawns they use to enable them to maintain it.<br /><br />In a period of terrible music with the record companies in shambles, out comes a masterpiece from a 71 year old poet. How poetic!
B007UW9VWO|5.0|This documentary is about a master and his art, his sons and the other artists in training.  Its about what true artists do that makes them true artists, and what artists in training have to go through to become masters themselves.  The medium of choice for these artist is Sushi.<br /><br />This is a must watch especially for people who love passionate stories about passionate people and what they love.  I highly recommend it for the documentary lovers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was sad and amazing at the same time, I would have changed a couple things but other than that it was great and a great way to end the series.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Like going to see the Live version at the Pantages Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, I was left speechless!  There are no words in any language that can adequately describe how good this show was.  I absolutely LOVED the singing in this show, and the Emotion, the pure emotion... wow, I've never seen anything better.  If you can't get to a Live Theatre production, this is your next best thing, and better yet, you get the added aid of closeups!  The acting and singing in this is the best I've ever seen!  I was absolutely blown away!  This is a MUST buy for any Phantom of the Opera lover! =)
B0087HT36U|1.0|on my phone and my tablet Siege Hero force closes as soon as I launch. doesn't even try to load. both devices run jellybean.
0142001104|5.0|Rarely is there proposed a concept and insight that gives you wings.  The Zander's do that, I feel that someone attached wings to my body, as I read the book and taught me how to soar.  The book is not prescriptive, although some might say it is. The book is not pedagogy, although some would say it is.  The book is a heartfelt new way of seeing life and living a vision.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades Darker is more about his secrets.  I like that I got to know Christian better in this book.  Once I started the first book and got fished with that one, I just had to start the second book to see what happens.  These two books are very addicting but very poorly written.  Like in the first book, some of the stuff they say is very unbelievable, but also addicting.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|yes the graphics and animation are good and there is a decent storyline but it doesn't flow and it was more of a chore to finish it rather than fun.  perhaps it's just me since I just finished a 5 star game (the haunt) and the differences were fresh in my mind.  I probably won't do the sequel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What I thought of the book 50 Shades of Grey is that I liked it.  I wanted to see what all of the hype was about this book.  Once I started, I could not stop reading it.  I thought the writing was a little bad, but it was still a decent book.  Some of what Christian and Ana did in the book wasent my cup of tea, but it did make me curious.  Some of the things in the book wasent believable though but other than that it was a good book.  I would read it again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best pinterest app I ha e come across yet for my kindle. although it dies not tell u how many Pi s total u have.
6304401736|5.0|One of the top five best movies ever made! I love it! I love it so much!!! I have only seen it dubbed in norwegian because Im from Norway, and I like it better with the norwegian dubbing. This movie is one of the best.
0345803485|5.0|Im shocked at the bad reviews I am seeing here! I read these books and couldnt put them down! Ive sent these to all my friends and sisters and all of us agree, BEST BOOK EVER!!!! I had to see what all the hype was about and man was I excited to finish these books! Only sad thing I can say is I have no idea what to read now that can top these! Im so sad there isnt more!
B007MG360G|2.0|The app is fine; wasn't all that entertaining. My main issue was that after about 10 minutes it asked if I wanted to get the full version, which I dont.  And I couldn't get around it. Grr. Overall I didn't really like it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved it. I read the book in 12 hours and turned around the next day and read it again.<br />Wonderfully written it made all my emotions sing. Looking forward to reading Travis's side of the stories<br />When the book is realeased next year.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Really am pleased with this product.  It is absolutely perfect for when the power goes off during storms.  Bright enough you can read a book using this light.  Highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I like the game it is fun and challening. There are two BUTS when you just can't figure it out there are no hints to get you on the right track. There are still some of the games I can't figure out. I would like to solve them. The other thing as soon as you solve it the game gets blocked by a message to continue to the next game or quit. I would like a second or two to actually is the puzzle solved. Just to see how it all looks done. Thank you.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|A decent Gothic horror story.  It did drag a little but the ending wasn't that predictable.  Still, the plot \\"resolution\\" wasn't one though the characters tried.  This left a feeling I could only describe as pointless in that it made you wonder what the last half hour was good for if it didn't accomplish anything.  It was however nice to see a movie that didn't need to resort to blood and gore to get a rise out of the audience.  Some of the spooky reveals were masterfully done.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Blair Witch/Troll Hunter type movie. Found myself skipping ahead a lot to get to meaty parts. You might like it if you like that type movie. I really couldn't get into it. Last 20-30 minutes of the film tell the whole story. A lot of cornball acting, overacting, & not at all acting, makes this a pretty boring piece. Could have been a pretty good film if not for the found footage film. Wasted money & time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good app recommend it to anyone been using it very easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a calculator
B0087HT36U|5.0|I don't care what all these people are saying how it's \\"fake\\" or it won't work....it works amazing on my HTC Rezound.and the gameplay....awesome! MUCH BETTER than angry birds in my opinion!!!! Great game!
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|I don't feel compelled to write reviews very often. But I do tonight. Just turned my tablet off, having finished my kindle version of this book, got out of bed, it's close to midnight, but yes. That's how nice it was to read this book. OK, so you might say it's commercial. You might say he is just trying to milk the golden calf just a little longer. It might be true. Or not. I like to think not. I can hear a most authentic voice coming out of these pages - of a young man's rise to stardom and him getting totally lost. Oh so lost. The lovely part is this - there IS someone watching over us from above or perhaps it was Mom Jean's prayers that finally came through and helped him pull out of it all. This is a fantastic story how a lost soul finds peace. Despite of stardom. For those of us who has \\"followed\\" JT for many years, since he was plastered on our walls and up until now when we all have grey hairs and a few more wrinkles - well, it's been a blast to hear his voice coming through and getting to know him a little better in these pages. Well done John - that was a very good read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have been running this app for over a month now before reviewing. I started this on my Droid and now it is on my Kindle Fire. And as my title says; No problems at all.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I heard \\"Hold On\\" on the radio this morning and I instantly fell in love with the song.  I watched their Utube videos and read reviews here and took a chance and purchased the MP3...I havent stopped listening to it. The harmonies and the vocals are simply AMAZING.  Her voice is hypnotizing.  I called my friends and told them to check them out.  This is a great CD.  I absolutely love it!
0451208706|4.0|I recently read The Man from St. Petersburg, Ken Follett's fourth novel, which came out in1982. While I would not rank it among his best, it is nevertheless a solid outing that contains all the usual elements that makes Follett an author you can count on to keep you turning those pages. There is the clean, clear writing style; the well-drawn, vivid characters; liberal helpings of action, violence and sex; and a mounting sense of tension that builds throughout and leads to an exciting climax. There is, as usual, a strong woman character (arguably two strong women characters, depending upon your point of view) who is central to driving the story forward. As is typical with Follett, the book takes place during an interesting historical period. This time it is the days leading up to World War One, a choice that adds nicely to the story's tension. And while this is a work of fiction, there is an intriguing use of a young Winston Churchill as a relatively minor but important character.<br />But what singles out this novel from others of Follett and the genre in general is the internal struggle it creates in the mind of the reader. The central conflict of the story revolves around a plot by a Russian anarchist to assassinate a Russian diplomat, Prince Orlov, who is on a trip to England to negotiate an alliance between his own country and England against the mounting threat from Germany. The anarchist, Felix, is motivated by his desire to keep Russia out of the war and save the lives of the working class Russian soldiers who would be lost should Russia align itself with England. While he is ostensibly the story's villain, he seems more misguided than evil. And the character engenders sympathy from the genuine feelings of love he exhibits for the wife and daughter of the story's chief protagonist, Lord Walden. Walden is charged by Churchill with winning the alliance with Russia. So for both political and personal reasons (Orlov is his wife's nephew) he is pitted against Felix and must strive to keep Orlov alive.<br />As the plot's central tension mounts so too does the emotional entanglement of its characters. The result is a growing realization by the reader that when all of the forces of the story finally collide, it cannot result in a happy ending. It is this dynamic which distinguishes the book and which is perhaps its most affecting aspect.<br /><br />secretagentfanforum.blogspot.com

B008RV5K5E|5.0|For those who think the dark knight started a few years ago,<br /><br />Batman is a fictional character, a comic book superhero created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics. Originally referred to as \\"The Bat-Man\\" and still referred to at times as \\"The Batman\\", he is additionally known as \\"The Caped Crusader\\",[2] \\"The Dark Knight\\",[2] and \\"The World's Greatest Detective,\\"[2] among other titles.<br /><br />Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is a four-issue comic book limited series comprising The Dark Knight Returns, The Dark Knight Triumphant, Hunt The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Falls, written and drawn by Frank Miller, originally published by DC Comics under the title Batman: The Dark Knight in 1986. When the issues were released in a collected edition later that year, the story title for the first issue was applied to the series as a whole. The Dark Knight Returns tells the story of a 55-year-old Bruce Wayne who comes out of retirement to fight crime, only to face opposition from the Gotham City police force and the United States government.<br /><br />If you LOVE batman this is a must SEE!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game that has more than one hundred and one game plus twenty seven more.hint download this
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is well written, and allows the reader to explore themes of religion and spirituality in a smiple yet powerful way. I purchased this book because so many readers gave it excellent reviews, and I concur with them. The story takes the reader on a journey with a teenaged boy, Pi Patel from his early days in India through to a life altering period of survival at sea following a shipwreck. He survives a shipwreck and co-exists on a lifeboat for some 227 days with a 450lb Bengal tiger. There are moments of humor, and revulsion. There is also palpable fear and trepidation that Pi experiences. However, his faith and will to survive trump the physical trauma that besets him. All however is tied together in the ending, and the book leaves you wanting to re-read many sections. This book is thought provoking and will become a classic.<br />I strongly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Unbelievably Addictive!  I Love Pinterest! I have it on my Kindle Fire and it is the first place I go when I turn it on!  What are you waiting for............Get It!  You wont be sorry!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|one of the best apps I ever got get it now its also fun on kindel fire its the greatest. apps ever!!!!!!!!!
B005XE33FM|5.0|Vinyl is incredible.  Have a decent but not high-end two-channel sound system with a mid-level turntable.  This has now become my reference material to both show off my system and compare all other vinyl to.  Until the audience responds, it is like Chris Cornell is in the living room singing.  Even if you were not a huge Soundgarden fan, this is worth getting as the songs are stripped down and his vocals are fantastic.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|As one who saw the 1968 night of the living dead movie and the dawn of the dead in the 1970's and the day of the dead in the 1980's. The walking dead live's up to those movies and to Mr George A. Romaro. I have seen so many of these so call dead movies that just are so bad that they were dead before they made them, But the walking dead made me remmber how i felt when i first saw my first dead movie when i was ten yrs old at the drive-in, yes i said the drive-in. So i hope they contiue to make this better as it go along and thank you for staying true to the dead movies.
0670023329|2.0|I am skeptical about the story of this book. First he lied about his mother and then while the write was starting to write he decided to tell the truth about snitching his mother and brother out. Second his escape over the body of a friend and not also electroucuted himself. Third after coming to the USA he literally became lazy and a deatbeat.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|For some this was unecessary...  But for long time KISS fans, \\"especially musicians\\" and those who have been around from the beginning; this was necessary.  As some pointed out the differences may seem marginal, but actually the minor changes make a big difference on a quality audio system (no iPod docks worth anything here).  Ezrin explains in his liner notes what was involved in attempting to remix the masters with some things being set on the original 16 track recording and others variable.  My son and I compared each song from the original issue and if \\"Resurrected\\" was the first release and the \\"Original\\" the second, you would hear many holes in the \\"Original\\"...  You many even approach your audio system and wonder what just went wrong with it and try to adjust the sound.<br /><br />For example: By bringing Peter Criss's drums forward just a bit more, re-equalizing the bass on both drums and Simmons bass playing, Detriot Rock City has many aspects you could not detect well before.  For example, Criss's consistent shuffle on the down beat is amazing!  You really cannot hear that in the original very well, it just seemed to be an echo from the reverb; but no it was intential, virtuoso playing.  During the famous four beat solo at the end of the song, Simmons glides down the E string of his bass at the same time Criss plays, this was almost undetectable in the original recording.  That is just to mention two key aspects, but in vitually every song there is something unique throughout the entire song.  Another is the acoustic guitar work in Beth.<br /><br />Why is this important? Because these nuances and colors show Ace, Peter, Gene and Paul and the true musicians they really are.  For years people, especially non-KISS fans, have accused the original four of being more show than musicians. But clearly this is not the case.  While their \\"style\\" may not be progressive like ELP or Yes, as far as complexity, their skill and musicianship is clearly there.  One more subtle example: In todays Hip-Hop, Rap and Pop culture, many drummers use what is known as a \\"click track\\". This is a metronome clicking the rhythm of the song to keep the drummer in sync with the rest of the music. (Not to mention many times used in live performance, because of all the ditgial add-ons that the stage musicians cannot repoduce.) Rather to bring up Detriot Rock City again, Peter Criss is the supurb metronome! His definitive playing moves the song with such a pulse and all this without a click track, add the shuffle I mentioned earlier, it just wouldn't be the great piece of Rock N Roll that it is.  Even Eric Singer (a wonderful drummer in his own right), is pressed to play Detriot Rock City today with the ssame Criss flare because you just cannot improve on perfection.  Back on KISS ALIVE III where Singer tried to add a double bass kick to the song, it only muddied the movement of the piece.<br /><br />I would recommend this CD to anyone, it is a necessary album on the shelf of KISS fans and Rock fans alike.tle example: In todays Hip-Hop, Rap and Pop culture, many drummers use what is known as a \\"click track\\".

B004UID2LC|5.0|REVISION 9-30-2012  After now having the download and play problems with 2.2.9,  I saw on another review dated Sept 29 better instructions for a Fix:  \\"... 30 seconds later I had a fixed version. Go to the app, settings, share with friends, and press the website. search freedi, tap it, press download.Easy.\\"  Somehow, 2.2.9 works good when downloaded from the app's website, but 2.2.9 doesn't work when it comes from the Amazon App Store.  Go figure!!<br /><br />Sept 15, 2012 Review:  After allowing an upgrade for the free app to ver 2.2.7 on Sept 14, I could no longer play youtube videos (got error about needing to check connection).  When trying to download a video, it said searching... and nothing happened.  I worked on this for hours and found the same happening to a lot of users of this app.  I finally discovered the app's website that's found in the app by clicking on Setting, then Share With Friends.  After going to that webpage (which is for the pro app)  I found a link for the free app and clicked on it.  Then on the free app webpage, I noticed that there's now an upgrade to ver 2.2.8 for the free app dated Sept 14 to fix the download problem.  There is also a link to an installer app called SAMv4.5 on the page.  I downloaded the SAM installer app first and installed it on my Kindle Fire (this worked fine, even though my Kindle has not been rooted).  I did already have my Kindle set to allow installation of applications from unknown sources under More.. Device.  I used SAM to first uninstall the 2.2.7 Freedi Youtube Downloader, then to download and install ver 2.2.8.  It now works perfectly agan.  Please make ver 2.2.8 available on the Amazon Store before more people get angry with the 2.2.7 version.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an outstanding book. Its hard to put down once you get started. Very good would recommend it to anyone. Awesome book!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|amazon acts like google isnt out there and cut their customers off from many apps that amazon doesnt offer...this is one of MANY apps that you cant download on any of the kindle fires. it may be better to just to buy the google tablet.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As in the first two books, I liked that attention holding events (aside from the searing descriptive sexual encounters) continued to unfold thoughout the author's story telling.<br />I thought  some descriptive vocabulary (i.e. bemused, smirk, gazing, grazing, mutter, etc.)was a bit over used.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Not only was I excited about getting the Millennium Trilogy to read as a series, I was more excited once I found out that I could get all three books in a bundle for my kindle. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's nest is hands down the best book series I have ever read. The suspense, the action, the never ending plot twists! Out of 5 stars, I wish I could give it 100,000. I recommend this series to everyone I can, and if they have a kindle, I urge them to get the bundle. It's a lovely price and it's worth it. Going from one book to the next is magnificent, and makes the reading experience so much better. I encourage anyone and everyone to read this bundle, you won't be disappointed.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another engrossing story from Lee Child. I am quite hooked on his writing and the character of his alter-ego Jack Reacher. Aside from the obvious, Jack's tendency to seek out trouble - albeit accidently, most of the time - and his fundamental morality are commendable even though he manages to inflict violence on those who obstruct him in his quest to 'do the right thing' by those he finds in need. I am also attracted to his quirky fascination with number patterns, prime numbers and dates/places, even postcodes (sorry, zip codes). The prose is also extremely well written (not that I claim to be any expert in the matter of great writing), grammatically correct and well structured, such that Jack walks into the sunset waiting for another ride on his random walk throughout the USA.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I saw this movie three times in the theatres and couldn't wait for it on bluray. Its not as well known as it should be in my opinion so I feel privileged to be in the know.  If you've not seen this movie, check out the trailer on IMDB or youtube.  I stumbled across the title on my local theatre's FANDANGO page checked out the online trailor and wound up seeing it that day. The action caught my attention, Mike Shinoda of LP co-producing the soundrack sold me on going to see it.  I dragged other friends and family to catch it with me a second and third time.  Indonesian with English subtitles but Ive found some of the best cinematic treats to be foreign and/or independent films.  This is no exception.<br /><br />  (Incidentally, a bonus on the blu ray is the option for foreign dialogue with English subtitles or English dialogue voice over. -i recommend seeing it in its original dialogue first to capture the beauty and raw essence the way it was presented in the theatres first.  The english dialogue is great though for the visually impaired so that they wont have to struggle and read. But the english voice over at times makes me feel like the actors emotions were lost in trsnslation)<br /><br />One of my Most favorite movies to date.  It has a Scar Face live or die feel to it.  Plot line is engaging and the artististic life or death martial art scenes are captivating. Its almost hard to believe these guys were actors. (IF YOU'RE A LINKIN PARK FAN you have to experience what Shinoda did with this awesome soundtrack)  Catch this movie at least ONCE.  And 'PLEASE, ENJOY YOURSELVES...'
B005EWDA9M|4.0|The Author almost reminded me of Yuki Mishima in many ways and as with many Japanese writers (I think...) a little bit repeditive. Loved the characters and the story. Have already read 3, so look forward to more of his novels.
B004ZQBP3Q|3.0|So for some reason I didn't know this band was as vulgar as it is.. I'm no stranger to vulgarity in music being a Gen Xer  and all. These guys just caught me off guard. In the grand scheme of things it is a light hearted album obviously geared  towards today's generation but that wont stop me from bumpin it in my car and jammin to it in the gym.  It has its moments of hype head bobbin beats and comically somewhat clever lyrics. It's entertaining enough to invest a few workouts in and I like chillin with it during a frustrating stent during  rush hour traffic  on occasion.  I mean these guys are no LINKIN PARK but they'll do.  (FYI -I would not reccomend the first album)
B0087HT36U|5.0|good game to get you over angry birds... fun and entertaining ...would recommend to someone who needs something to keep their attention
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This movie is so funny and just as good as the first! Buy this movie and you wont be dissapointed!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love Reacher, I really do. I have all the books and have become the lending library for my friends- most of which claim Reacher as their new addiction. But I am putting this book in the bottom of the pile. I appreciate the effort but I think the effort was not up to usual standards, sorry Mr. Child. I would rather have only one really great Reacher book per year, than two that are not worth my anticipation. Slow down, Lee- give us something really great. (And PLEASE get Jack to Virginia in the next one).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW.....if there ever was a great trilogy, this one is it.... Thank you Ms. James!!  A real keep you guessing love story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and straight forward.  Perfect for kindle! Works just like it should. No hunting for buttons or sorting through multiple screens to operate.
B006O7XOOW|3.0|Overall, the toy is fun for the baby, but it's a bit of a pain for the adults.  The \\"walls\\" of the ball tracks aren't really high enough, so most of the time the balls eject from the intended chutes, and roll across the floor.  The toy itself is sturdy, and well made, and the baby can stand up while holding on to it.  The balls, oddly enough, are very cheap, and seem like they will be permanently destroyed the first time an adult steps on them - since the actual stand is so well engineered, the balls almost seem like they were added as an afterthought.  It certainly is not a bad toy, and the idea was good, but the execution was a bit lacking.<br /><br />I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|Pathetic, Ostentatious, Arrogant, Not Funny Swill.  As over the top as the whole stupid charade was, Samantha was the worst.  The audience is expected to believe that a savvy business woman would make the egregious errors in judgement that she did.  Such disrespect for a culture where SHE is the guest.  And really, a man like that would never have an interest in a woman in her 50's anyway.  It's not fun to admit but a wealthy, attractive man like that would never be with anyone less than 20 yrs his junior.<br /><br />And the Karoake scene, uhg, Samantha please shut up.  I feel bad that Kim Cattral even went along with any of this script.  She can't be that hard up.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Bad dialogue.  Bad plot line. Absurd \\"let's take off our helmets!\\" character actions.  Horrible acting. Retreaded plot from Alien(s), and The Thing. Terrible music, which had nothing to do with the scene it was supposed to be enhancing; instead sounded like someone had the radio on too loud next door.  Adris; what is that accent you are trying to fake? He has an English accent in real life, that apparently he can't cover up so we get some bizarre Houston-Luton speak.  If our DNA can be traced back to mollusks (it can), how could this thing have given us DNA?? Did it cut in line between early primates and humans?  Then how did the DNA from earlier creatures match perfectly? Why?  Even with DNA you don't know what species are going to develop or die out. I loved Alien, liked Blade Runner and Aliens, this plain stinks.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Assuming that if you're reading this, you're either a Circus Maximus fan, or a follower of the genre, so my remarks will be in that context<br /><br />Nine is their third album.  Most of us who are followers of this band, waited patiently for them to get this done, looking forward to another helping of their special brand of huge progressive metal.  Isolate is simply one of my favorite albums of all time, and I listened to it hundreds, maybe thousands of times over the past few years.  Both of the earlier albums from these guys, have incredible layering, virtuoso musicianship, high levels of technical perfection, and simply remarkable songwriting.<br /><br />Nine is an evolution, and indeed a culmination of many of the ideas they have been drawing on in their earlier works.  The melodic passages are bolder, the crunchy guitars even crunchier, the bass lines even more violent, the keyboards even more sweeping, and the drumming more hard hitting than ever.  But it is an album, a collection of ideas, songs, melodies, and lyrics and themes.<br /><br />This is not a heavy metal album, and those that are looking for 80s hair band heavy will not find it here.  This is a masterful creation of 5 remarkable musicians and composers and arrangers, who've made a seminal album representing their talent and vision.<br /><br />Each song is its own gigantic place in time, where you have to spend time listening over and over again to what they've constructed.  Its not as easily accessible to the discerning ear as was Isolate, where it was more glammy, more catchy, more rocky...  nope, Nine is HUGE in its vastness.  Where I had to listen to it a bunch of times in the first few days, get burnt out, then stop for a few days.<br /><br />Then I felt the inner urge to come back for another try at absorption, and this time, I simply CANNOT stop playing it over and over.  Now I understand where they were going.  This is simply some of the greatest composition and arranging of melodic symphonic metal I have ever heard.  It is a symphony of layers of instruments, delivering precise musical phrasing, surrounding a core song.<br /><br />Yes, Architect of Fortune are Burn After Reading are remarkable, but all the others are too. It took me a while to connect with everything on the album, and now I have bits of Game of Life in my head, as well as all the others on the album.  Indeed, I waited to write this, as I've been busy, plus to be fair to myself and others who may read this, I had to absorb and understand what our friends from Circus Maximus have created for us.<br /><br />In conclusion, I can understand why folks who were easily sucked in by Isolate's forward style, and the First Chapter's hard hits, could feel that Nine is foreign on first listen.  It took me some time to discover all the nooks and crannies on this record, and all I can say is...  remarkable!
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|Don't expect a faithful telling of Snow White.  This film is very dark.  Great to look at, but it goes on way too long.  Another problem is that Charlize Theron is much more attractive than the actress who plays Snow White!  The movie is so dragged out that this review was written while I was watching it!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|What a fun movie to watch. Action, Drama, Fantasy, all wrapped up in a great movie. You gotta see this one.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I'm not someone who has ever really played games much.  did play Oregon trail many years ago on our family computer with my kids and loved that game.  I'm really slow at learning all this tech stuff don't have a fancy phone etc. thought I would try this game on kindle fire I got for Christmas last year.  I was very slow figuring out how this game worked so my settlement is spaced goofy but I like playing it now a lot. will never ever spend real money.  wish more items that cost real money had been just play money.  thinking about deleting game and buying it again and setting up my settlement a little better.  could I do that?  I've added all the land I can add, and some of the little \\"quests or whatever they're called I will never do - like the mining, or fishing (can't figure that one out) or the ones that cost real money - wish I could delete them.  Some of them I have done though. I just now figured out there was an update I needed to add and that actually added a new house, a horse stable, and a totem pole that I definitely willl add to my space.  Wish I'd known to look for this sooner to have another house to add. did originally have timing problems like everyone else. And it seems the energy is now building up by itself over time, which is good.  glad it was fixed.@

1591844096|5.0|I just finished Linchpin in one 5 hour sprint during a flight from Washington Dulles to SFO.  The book is spellbinding. Maybe it's because I'm in the right \\"zone\\" for the ideal audience (early career, up and coming technical professional), or maybe it's just because I also read his Tribes book and it had the same effect. I'm not sure, but what I am sure about is that this book is a must read for anyone who is in a technical field, out of school, and working in a professional / competitive environment.<br /><br />Pros - makes an excellent case for the new habits professionals need to have to survive and advance in our new 21st century economy.<br /><br />Cons - the book is a bit repetitive at times. OK OK - I'm a genius. We're ALL geniuses... I get it. The ego stroking of the reader by Godin gets a bit excessive. Past that - the book rocks.<br /><br />I've dogged eared and marked up the hardcopy and passed it on to friends and coworkers - now it's making the rounds at my office.
0525953728|5.0|Unfortunately, I do not read books often, however I decided this one was important to me and that I needed to read it for myself for some semblance of closure to the Bin Laden Raid. This was an amazing read and I applaud Mr.\\"Owen\\" for writing this book and giving the first hand details of the events surrounding the Osama Bin Laden Raid.  Let me be perfectly clear,after reading this book there should be no question that what Mr. Owen has done is brave and noble.  Some have questioned his loyalty and patriotism for supposedly revealing how operations are performed with SEAL team 6.  Mr. Owen does not sell out any of his teammates and gives just enough detail and places a cap on anything to in depth.  As Mr. Owen stated, the goal of the book was not to make money but to raise money for at least 4-5 charities cited in his book as well as help fund September 11th, 2001 charities and bring closure to those involved in Sept. 11.  I do not question Mr. Owen's patrotism, and or his loyalty to the SEALS, he is a hero...plain...simple.<br /><br />  As I say the book gives great details where appropriate, and initially begins with a little background about Mr. Owen in a semi first person fashion.  It is not stricken with dates or is boring or hard to read like some Autobiography book critiques cite for other literature.  But, instead Mr. Owen provides everything from his view everything about the build up, the missions, the other team members he worked for.  How he learned everything he knew for the Bin Laden raid from past missions and flukes.  Mr. Owen cites several other missions and deployments to other areas of Afganistan, etc to illustrate what a SEAL does, and how every mission is performed, the mental and physical aspects that pertain to it as well.<br /><br />  I highly encourage you to read this book, take the time to understand the Acronyms and read about why our country is so safe; because men like these stand at her gates.  Thank You, Mr. Owen.  I plan on donated to fallen SEALS foundation after reading the book.<br /><br />\\"For God and country I pass Geronimo, Geronmino E.K.I.A\\"<br /><br />Five/Five from a very difficult critic.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|***Safe review, contains NO spoilers***<br /><br />If you're looking for a flashy, visually polished fantasy film with very little depth, this is the film for you. Overall, it's not un-entertaining, but it falls short of being anything great.<br /><br />Let's start with the pros:<br /><br />- It's a very pretty film with polished, stunning special effects, good costumes, and a relatively decent set<br />- The plot moves quickly with lot's of action; there are few slow moments<br />- Charlize Theron's character is interesting and relatively well-acted<br />- Lots of potential...undeveloped potential, but potential all the same!<br /><br />And the cons:<br /><br />- Kristen Steward's performance is abysmal. Her expression doesn't change for the first fifty minutes of the film. Her lines are delivered in a monotone...and her character makes no sense, which really isn't her fault<br />- The plot and characters wander aimlessly throughout the entire film. There's plenty of chances to develop characters, but these are never used effectively. Most of the characters have little to no backstory or motivation, and the things they do are often inexplicable<br />- Why is it Snow White? The Snow White story is scarcely used, and the story would have been stronger if it had stood on its own<br />- Contrived fantasy, at best. Most of the fantasy elements were clearly drawn from films like LOTR, Narnia, and Legend.<br /><br />Overall, its a movie to rent, not buy, and to watch with popcorn. Whatever you do, don't focus too much on it!

B0055TNSB4|4.0|Released in May 1978 (Capitol 11698), Stranger In Town was the 10th studio album from Bob Seger but just his second with The Silver Bullet Band. It reached # 4 on the Billboard album Top 200 charts, eventually reached platinum status 6 times over, and produced four hit singles, all billed as Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band.<br /><br />The first, Still The Same, peaked at # 4 Billboard Pop Hot 100 and # 27 Adult Contemporary (AC) in May/June 1978 on Capitol 4581 b/w Feel Like A Number, Hollywood Nights hit # 12 Hot 100 n August/September on Capitol 4618 b/w Brave Strangers, We've Got Tonight made it to # 13 Hot 100/# 29 AC in November/December on Capitol 4653 b/w Ain't Got No Money, and in April/May 1979, Old Time Rock And Roll would top out at # 28 Hot 100 on Capitol 4702 b/w Sunspot Baby, the only B-side not included in the album.<br /><br />Of course, Old Time Rock And Roll got new life in 1983 when it was re-released as Capitol 5276 and got to # 48 Hot 100 in September/October. This thanks to the film that launched the career of Tom Cruise. In Risky Business, his character Joel, left alone for the week-end, and in violation of his parent's admonishment NOT to touch the new stereo, raids the liquor cabinet, cranks up the stereo full blast, and cavorts around the room clad only in underwear, socks and pink dress shirt to Old Time Rock And Roll.<br /><br />On the tracks, Seger is backed approximately half and half by The Silver Bullet Band and The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.

B006YTTVHO|4.0|I'm a shy person, and I find myself getting very uncomfortable, even now as an adult, anytime I have to meet new people.  It's amazing to me how hard it can be to think of anything to say when I'm around people I don't know well.  That's why I liked this book.  It was a good reminder of how to make those situations less awkward and more comfortable.  I would recommend this book to others.  I don't think it's gonna be life-changing, but we can all use reminders every now and then of how to deal with situations in which we're not overly comfortable.
B008EQIA7W|2.0|I am a great fan of Greek mythology, but the second movie in this series, like the first, is not great.  Given the special effects and the writers available today, it's truly sad that the producers couldn't come up with a better story.
0385344333|1.0|I've read all the Reacher books. This by far is the most poorly written book. From beginning to end I kept wondering why I was reading this book. If you skip reading, you aren't missing a thing!
0307592731|3.0|It took me a while to get to this latest Oprah read. And there are aspects here that I enjoyed. I liked the voice here for the most part. And I was, at first, intrigued by the wreckage of her young life leading her to make an unusual decision to trek the Pacific Crest trail. While I was engaged in some sections, I couldn't help but be annoyed by the self-indulgent, self-absorbed excesses. Which seems to be the usual thing you get with so many memoirs and the like these days. While I believe there is something sincere in the author, I still couldn't see the idea of ditching everything to do this raw  and wild trek. Something just didn't seem real to me here. The author does admit that she wrote this book many years later and went through her journals of the time period, perhaps, this is what makes it seem as if the venture into wild nature itself is not nearly as important as her inner struggles and expressing this to an excessive degree. Her foray into the books in her life, her ruminations about her mother's death from cancer, her musings on her shattered life gets a bit repetitive, and I gave out. I know these kinds of reads are popular right now, but I found this one to be one of the lesser ones.I think THE GLASS CASTLE in some ways was a better book, simply because the actual telling the reader of this strange upbringing and where it got her parents and what she had to overcome made truly page-turning reading. In comparison, this isn't all that riveting.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen dealing with this subject matter. Others use actors to portray Navy Seals, however in this case the Seals were used to portray themselves. What a difference that makes. Note: NOT a movie for the squiemish ... very true to life. A Great and Fitting Tribute to our unsung  Heroes in the Navy Seals.

B0002O06N0|5.0|If you like the Black Keys, buy this album.  It still has their old extremely bluesy feel of the previous 2 albums (Thickfreakness/Big Come Up), but the song choruses and hooks become much more catchy and poppy (this is not a bad thing like some hipsters might argue).  Rubber Factory and Brothers are both must have Black Keys albums
B007X6SMD6|5.0|Amazon - I have to give you a Big High Five for this. I can't believe how easy you have made cloud computing. First off, you made it simple for everybody. Second off - you GOT the concept, that applications were the important part of the cloud, straight off. That is the part that I am amazed about. So many people get that part wrong. Or just pick a single niche, or application. You can do them ALL. BRAVO! I was literally speechless at your capabilities. For example, the steps it takes to start up a fully load balanced and redundant website is simply inspired. It is so easy. The Technology Gods must love you guys. Not only did you get the cloud right, not only did you get the technology right, on top of that, you made it simple. My God, I must be dreaming. Getting started with AWS is so simple, even my Mother could use it (and that is saying an awful lot, I'm telling you). I am an Amazon Affiliate, and if I could sell Cloud Services creatively, I feel that it would be like putting money in the bank, literally. The word AWESOME keeps coming to mind. I went to college for computer science / electrical engineering, and ended up in marketing and sales - go figure huh? With a technocrat background in software engineering and 20 years of marketing networking/middleware/IC & BI products + business experience, I find that I truly understand the underlayers of the Cloud, as well the higher layer applications, plus the business reasons why people would want and need this. Anyone thinking of using this UTILITY, should go straight to Amazon. Run, don't walk. These guys have it down. They know what they are doing. The other people in the market are either just starting out, or have one application - like web hosting, or distance learning that they rely on to build their business. Amazon can do all of that and quite simply do everything else. The Sky IS the LIMIT. The AWS Cloud, is the Ultimate Resource for Off Premise Computing. It Costs Less than having an IT Center and Personnel. It Saves Times and Money. Two good things everyone wants to do. You get One Bill, at the end of the month, for the resources that you've Actually Used. Technology-wise, they've made it So Simple, it's like falling off a log - or maybe falling out of bed, since there aren't many logs available in Silicon Valley. There are here though. I'm out in Texas, where we are swimming in logs. I have some in my back pasture for night time fires in our firepit. Anyway, I'd say, Get the Document - it's free. Watch the Accompanying Videos - they are amazing. You will definitely get a sense of this Overwhelmingly, Good Utility. AWESOME! SIMPLY AWESOME! Amazon, you've gone and done it again. First, it was online shopping malls with affiliate marketing, and now its Cloud Computing. Where will you go next? I Guess the Sky is Truly The Limit With Amazon! Five Stars All the Way.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|I agree with the two or three star reveiws of Kisses on the Bottom.  Some tracks have a nice vocal at his lower range. His voice only works on some of the songs. Some songs sound so weak and tired. The band never opens up and plays, justs walks along so slow with Pauls voice. One good note on this is he's giving jobs to musicians.

B008OB1QFK|5.0|Chris Knight, the patron songwriter of hard luck, uses this long-awaited release to focus on the brisk realities of a lethargic economy. Its lyrics contain heavy doses of skepticism about humanity and trust in guns over government: the only one who can actually help you is yourself. However, his pessimistic tone belies a sense of comfort in knowing that self-reliance coupled with ironclad inner strength will overcome even the direst of circumstances. Nothing is sugar-coated here; the rugged emotion in his lyrical delivery pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you have been on quite a ride.<br /><br />The star cuts include the title track, \\"Little Victories,\\" which features John Prine, one of Knight's primary songwriting influences. When times get hard, there is a certain resignation to celebrate even mundane accomplishments like making it to the store to buy junk food.<br /><br />\\"Nothing On Me\\" may be the best song on the album. It is an anthem of unyielding bullheadedness in the face of adversity featuring the tagline, \\"Times are tough, but they ain't got nothing on me.\\" He colorfully brings to life a three-legged dog that picks fights with bears as an allegory of the never-give-up spirit that defines so much of the America you don't see on TV. \\"Out Of This Hole\\" mirrors that spirit and adds a contrite decision to overcome poor life choices.<br /><br />He polishes \\"Hard Edges\\" from his Trailer Tapes release with some instrumentation. It inserts itself seamlessly into the theme of this album, but the rawness of the original is hard to beat.<br /><br />Chris Knight thrives as a singer-songwriter because his lyrics and their delivery are as authentic as it gets; you are convinced the characters he depicts in his songs are actually singing them. In other words, you believe him. That is the hardest thing for a songwriter to do and it is what separates a great songwriter from a good one.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|it was good but then it started not downloading after about a month. it keeps saying do u want to upgrade. when I click yes, it takes me to the appstore and there is nothing there
B008JTK9NW|4.0|The first couple times I listened to this I thought it was \\"ok\\".  The more I listen to it the more I like it. I would have given it 5 stars, but there are a couple songs that just don't seem to fit in (West Coast Rock Steady & Bad Boy).  No big deal, I usually just skip these songs.  I don't think I like it as much as their Satellite CD (my favorite), but that's a hard one to beat IMO.

B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah always astounds me with their albums, all distinct in their own way and yet all very much so Meshuggah.

Amazing work, highly recommended to any fans of metal that makes you think and headbang simultaneously.<br /><br />Thinkbanging?
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|What a bore this was.  Even ignoring the fact that a single .50 cal machine gun would take the Captain in about 3 seconds, his only defense is a trash can lid sized shield, the only thing super was the goofiness of the idea that this would be a good movie.<br />At the end they find him frozen in ice, he's been there for 60 year too, and they thaw him out.  The mistake was not placing this turkey film into the ice with him.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Sorry, didn't do it for me. Read about a third and it doesn't get better. Can't be bothered to finish. But one can't argue with millions of other people so don't listen to me.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie was actually better than I expected.  I kept my expectations low, I guess, but I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Not great, but good enough to rent.  Probably not worth a purchase unless you're an avid collector.

B007SUW24W|5.0|ED SHEERAN  is an amazing artist. His music is so good, and they are so catchy. I was a fan way before the olympic ceremony, and i am not even from the UK. I heard him on Pandora Radio and fell in love with his songs. He is definitely a very talented artist.<br /><3

B0085G0DH6|4.0|The sleeper is activated after lying low for 33 years in the ECM vault. At that time in Japan, the American quartet with Dewy Redman had much popularity than this European quartet. My Song had imprinted their play as pop-like music for Japanese listeners. A certain Japanese critic wrote his impression on this  Belonging Concert, so titled by a Japanese promotor at that time, as having good quality but personally not satisfactory in the liner notes of Mysteries. We thought the American quartet's play had much larger scale in their expression and thrilling tense in their performance. The Sleeper completely overruled our biased feeling to them.<br /><br />Jan Garbarek's sound here and there reminds me of the Charles Lloyd in the late sixties. New Dance has quite similar atmosphere with Lloyd's Sombrero Sam. Flute solo in the introduction part of Oasis make Japanese recall of KAGURA or sacred Shinto music and dance. Lloyd sometimes presents similar sounds to us. My best track is continuously played Personal Mountains and Innocence, which has various colors and shapes. It starts with yelling of Garbarek in the flood of rhythm and after nearly 15 minutes brilliant melody changes into ballad. Keith shows a gospel touch piano solo. After Keith's action to search suitable sound the group settles in Scandinavian landscape.<br /><br />Suddenly, I struck by a strange idea. If I only hear piano sound of this album, isn't it just like a Keith's solo concert. I heard his solo concert twice in this May. His music in here would be materialized with only his piano sound. It's quite similar with those concerts in the quality. Was this the reason why he disbanded this group, and never played with hones after that. Then, why he accepted to release this material again, notwithstanding the fact he nodded to a selected version of the same concert more than 20 years ago. What he thought enough is not enough in his current eye? Or, is he thinking of the reunion of this band? If so, I'll go to see and hear them this time.o see and hear them this time.

He most definitely stay in your mind  for a while.

0553381695|4.0|Once again the descriptions of all the pomp and circumstance of courtly/lordly/knightly dress, banners and manners slowed down the narrative. The most likeable characters so often suffer as much or more than the bad guys makes it and the story becomes exasperating in some cases.  Also, the narrative loops around in confusing timelines.  And more is revealed later than sooner about some characters and events.  Martin may actually believe that the heart of men/women is mostly dark and evil.  Or, there may be light at the end of the tunnel he has created.  Read on!<br />[[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY: 1969 - Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll, and Football]]

A bleak winter is coming, yet can it get bleaker?<br />The stories of many of the characters are captivating, although it becomes more difficult to believe that they will all be weaved together into a satisfying conclusion.

B007K196C0|5.0|I was very impressed and moved by Keith Richards \\"Life\\".  He recognizes and honors all the Rhythm and Blues founders and legacy carriers that shaped Rock and Roll and these  folks are definitely the GodFathers and GodMothers to The Rolling Stones.  He admits his shortcomings and triumphs and does the same for those instrumental people that make Keith who he is.  It's not all glammer and glitz and being a Rolling Stone does have it's dark side--but it is a marvelous journey.  Kudos on his insight to his Jamaican brothers and sisters.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its ok&hellip;but not for 7 bucks. I could play Pc demo version for FREE and have a better game play than this. Don't get me wrong , it really is better than block story, but it could be much better. I mean, really? 7 bucks for ALPHA?

0738702994|5.0|Everyone else seems to have covered things pretty well but I have to put my 2 cents in.  I love this deck.  It's my go to.  I bought one as a gift for my best friend and she loves hers as well.  The artwork is gorgeous and it's easy to understand what the cards mean just looking at the pictures.<br /><br />I've seen some people complain about quality or size but I really have nothing bad to say.  I suppose the edges of mine have gotten a little frayed from use but I wouldn't not but this deck because of that.  I mean, they're made of paper and I shuffle them several time a day.  Shit happens.  I think they are a good size.  Large enough to see the pictures but I can still shuffle them effectively.  The book that comes with the product is very informative and has a lot of cool stories.<br /><br />I think this will always be my everyday tarot deck. I can't even imagine changing.  I would recommend this to anyone, beginners to experts.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is the story of Osama Bin Laden`s last few moments on this earth as seen through the eyes of a Navy Seal. This book tells of the preparation that an elite Seal team went through to make sure that this mission went out as flawlessly as possible. It's the step-by-step story of  the compound from entry to exit, and the aftermath of the mission from the eyes of a Navy Seal. No Easy Day isn't only about this single assignment. Mark Owen has written a story about his time as a Seal, from the difficult testing to become an elite Seal Team Six member, through several missions, and up until his retirement.<br /><br />This is Mark Owen's story, written in first person, and I found the account of his days as a Navy Seal fascinating. I purchased the book for a couple of reasons, mainly because of some morbid curiosity I had about Osama Bin Laden's death. I wanted to know if a big gun battle took place, if there were followers at the compound fanatically dedicated to protecting him. I wanted to know if he hid with his family, and what sort of defenses he had around his compound. I wanted to know all that and more, and I wanted to hear it from someone who was there. This book answers the important questions - the ones I was most concerned about.<br /><br />This isn't just a story about the final minutes of Osama Bin Laden's life. It's the story of a Navy Seal, from a his perspective. It talks about earlier missions in Afghanistan, and a high profile job of rescuing a marine captain, Richard Phillips, from Somali pirates. He writes a bit about growing up in Alaska, and his obsession with becoming a Seal from a young age. On some Amazon reviews I've read people are complaining because the book isn't just about Osama Bin Laden, but I found the background intriguing, making the book as a whole more interesting because it shows what it took for Mark Owen to be a Seal. It showed the dedication required to be a Navy Seal, and if it weren't for that dedication and hard work the storming of Osama Bin Laden's compound might not have happened without a loss of life.<br /><br />As far as the writing goes...well, the story could have probably been told with a bit more flair. That's not to say that it was full of spelling or grammatical errors - I'm sure I probably have more of those in this review than existed in all of Mark Owen's book. (I call my own errors \\"Easter Eggs\\" just so it sounds better.) No, the writing style was a bit dry at times, though every chapter held my attention fully, but I was always left wanting a bit more. For instance, he describes his team mates, but I never got a true sense of who they were. I did get a good sense of Mr. Owen himself, and he is a character that the reader is drawn to. He's a man who deserves the title of hero, though he seems humble in his writing. Mark Owen tells of simply doing his job with the help of brave men like himself.<br /><br />I don't know about the eBook version, or the paperback copies, but the hardcover edition of No Easy Day has several pages of full color photographs of Afghanistan, and Mark's gear. As an added bonus there's detailed images of the Osama compound that lays out what took place during the mission.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to learn how a member of Seal Team Six lives this book is for you. If you simply want to know the details of how Osama Bin Laden died then this book's for you too, but you're going to need to start reading around page 150. If you're looking for a political agenda then I believe you're looking in the wrong place. Mark notes a few personal opinions of President Obama, but nothing that isn't obvious, and pretty typical running for all politicians. If you're looking for secrets that the government doesn't want you to know then this book isn't for you. Mr. Owen doesn't mention strategies, weapons, or technology that we don't already know about, and that might be what I feel is missing at times. Maybe he was holding back so that the Seals will still have a surprise or two for the bad guys?<br /><br />Was this the most exciting book I've read this year? Probably not, but considering that the majority of my reading is Fantasy and Science Fiction says a lot about it. I rarely read autobiographies, so the fact that I read though this one, and did it in just a couple of days, it quite a compliment. It even got me to visit Netflix and stream Black Hawk Down when I finished the story.<br /><br />So, if you haven't read it yet then get a copy. It's a pretty good read, and it answers a lot of questions about the final moments of the world's most renowned terrorist. There's a final plus side. According to Mr. Owen, most of the proceeds from the book will go to charities that help out Navy Seals and their families.ll have a surprise or two for the bad guys?<br /><br />Was this the most exciting book I've read this year?

B004UID2LC|1.0|okay, so I have had this app for more than 6 or 7 months on my Kindle Fire.... and well now, it doesn't want to download anything!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was very spellbinding. Even though you know almost from  the beginning who is going to be the main person to win. It then takes a completely different twist. You just have to keep reading to see how it ends. Can't wait to read the second book.
B005RUV0NY|4.0|Though the effects are less than would otherwise be afforded by larger budget offerings, this series has great story, and real and believable characters. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to season three.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better! I almost gave this product 4 stars because there were times the streaming lagged a little bit, which is frustrating when Walkers are attacking!! Since I'm not sure if that's because ofbthe prodcut or my internet connection I won't penalize them for it. I love the convenience of instant streaming!
B00992CF6W|5.0|when this game got on the kindle fire I was so happy. I got it as soon as I saw it. Its hard to figure out the co trope and it needs a few updates but its great. it needs a totorial but its still great.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i love this app. im a big music junkie so im constantly downloading music. i also use it to download music for my son as well as tv shows. the only small problem i have is that whem downloading multiple things at once it slows down the process. so you have to decrease your downloads to atleast 2 at a time. Other than that, i love it!!

B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Besides its deliberately controversial theme of kids engaged in a violent reality show, the movie does not catch one's attention in any other way. It has freely drawn elements from the Roman gladiator arena, 18th century european aristocracy (only the make-up), WWII jewish ghettos etc., without contributing any original idea in return (not even on the sci-fi front). Can one use the movie as the basis of a discussion with kids of the horrors in humanity's own past? Not really, because it handles the theme of societies gone wrong in a cartoonish manner that does not capture any of the complexity behind these events.

1932100660|3.0|It is a kind of book that I don't remember having read before. It is written for the public and it dumbs down a lot of things, but it retains some of the characteristics of scientific papers. I liked that Dr. Campbell explained most things, including study methodologies, instead of just stating his conclusions. I also appreciate the fact that he mentions the uncertainties about the studies that he cites in favour of his opinion; and while he still maintains his point with something like \\"still it's not unreasonable to assume that...\\", I felt that he was honest about what he assumed and what he drew, with a higher degree of certainty, from clearer data. He states his conclusions strongly, but I felt that I was given enough information to also reach my own.    I was also very interested to read about things that go on in the backstage of science, about the politics and the influence of industry, and also about the difficulties of scientific research. Many of the stories that Dr. Campbell writes fit with other things that I have read or heard elsewhere. He added more clarity and explanations to my previous ideas.    After having read The China Study I went on the Internet and started to look for opposing opinions. I tend to do that, especially after reading surprising information or extreme recommendations. Among others, I read Denise Minger's comment ([...]), some of the comments she got for it and Dr. Campbell's answer. In general, the debate only increased my trust in this book and it's authors. However, it also strengthened some doubts and questions that I was left with.    While my impression was generally positive, I feel that some things are missing. The book convinced me of the benefits of whole plants, but it was not entirely convincing regarding the necessity of completely giving up animal foods. Dr. Campbell shows evidence that low animal protein intake prevents several diseases and from there he seems to infer that no animal protein is even better. That isnot necessarily true and he writes himself that the biological mechanisms in our bodies are not that predictable. So one question that I was left with is whether a no animal protein diet is better than low animal protein one.    Another thing that is not mentioned, and that I would have liked to see covered, is how the quality of the animal products influences health. With \\"quality\\" I am thinking of industrially produced meat and milk vs. the more naturally produced ones. My belief is that the American animal food is much worse than the animal food in countries where farming means less hormones, antibiotics, poor food, constricted space, foul air for the animals. I think that eating moderate amounts of meat, fish and milk from animals raised in healthy conditions is a healthy thing to do. However, it's quite possible that I am wrong and this is why I would have liked to see the subject more thoroughly analyzed.    Before reading this book I thought that veganism was extreme and not particularly healthy. After reading it, plus some Internet articles, I realized that some of my beliefs were wrong. However, there seems to be data showing that vegans do have some specific health problems. Maybe these problems are from a diet that is not varied enough or maybe it really come from complete lack of animal food. Dr. Campbell's book doesn't talk enough about these vegan-related health issues and how to avoid them.    Anyway, with its good and bad parts, I recommend it for reading to anyone who likes to stay informed about health.

B008TRUDAS|3.0|I'd heard a lot of great things about Colleen Hoover's Slammed . And... I'd heard a lot of terrible things about it, as well. So when I had the opportunity to read a review copy through NetGalley, I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about. I didn't expect to have such a meh reaction to it, however.<br /><br />Layken's single mother has moved her and her brother from Texas to Ypsilanti, Michigan for a job. The first day she's there, she meets neighbor Will Cooper: handsome, mysterious, and really into slam poetry. They have an instant attraction that's quickly derailed when they discover something that will keep them apart: the big secret of the book.<br /><br />Slammed had a ton of potential, and its emotional resonance is definitely there at points, which is probably what led to its popularity. Still, it's an uneven roller coaster for a reader, with moments of poignant emotion and then moments of roll-your-eyes unbelievability that draw you right out of the story. The very idea that Layken and Will could have forged enough of a connection during their short time together to have sustained them through the rest of the book's drama was one of the biggest eye-rolls of them all: the insta-love trope is one of my least favorites and yet it's rolled out here with a red carpet entrance and VIP seating.<br /><br />Still, as I said, there are glimmers of what might have been a brilliant novel, which is frustrated time and again by such things as the pat ending, the too-convenient set-up once you see the pieces fall into place, and the over-the-top climactic moments, all of which overshadow subtle, quieter moments, which, left on their own, might have been enough to make this a really good, if not great read. As it stands, I was left with no impulse to read the book's sequel, which picks up a few months after Slammed 's epilogue; I know all I need to know about these characters and based on the short excerpt placed at the end of this book, the manufactured drama of the second book will be more than I can tolerate or believe.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on Goodreads.of the second book will be more than I can tolerate or believe.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on Goodreads.

1451626657|3.0|Maybe it was somewhat shocking in its day to take a critical and lampooning look at the military and contemporary society, but its somewhat status quo today.  The writing is decent, but not extraordinary.  The chapters focus on a separate character, weaving their interactions together with some flashbacks and a few other out-of-chronology accounts.  There are repeating themes about irony, deceiving appearances, contradictory motives, power-blind leaders, prostitutes, black markets, infirmaries, and borderline insanity. There are some interesting points made, but not nearly enough to fill up 450 pages. The list of characters is fairly impressive and engaging, but the narrative itself doesn't have a powerful arc, nor are there many philosophical insights or cathartic moments along the way. The characters are amusing, but one doesn't make an emotional connection.  Overall, the passages on prostitutes and black markets seemed cliche by modern standards, and deflating via ennui with their trite and vulgar presence.  In short, I was not blown-away (excuse the pun) or enthralled by this novel, skimming quickly over a large assortment of pages.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game.  Nice to find a game that lasted more than a couple of hours.  Well worth the $3.99 price tag.
0596805527|5.0|JavaScript: The Definite Guide does not, at least like my own [[ASIN:1849510342 Django JavaScript Integration: AJAX and jQuery]], treat a little bit of JavaScript among other topics. It is about JavaScript, both the core language and (briefly) the leading third-party offering to the JavaScript world, and it gives a comprehensive and authoritative treatment of the JavaScript language in its core and as applies to the web. It does not cover Dojo or Prototype, for instance, but jQuery, which it does cover, sees significantly more usage (or at least search queries) than all of the other libraries and frameworks put together.

030758836X|1.0|I have no idea why this execrable novel has garnered such great reviews. There must be more logrolling in publishing than in any other industry.<br /><br />Everyone knows the plot: Amy Elliott Dunne, who was immortalized by her writer parents in a series of children's books, one day goes missing.  Her husband, Nick, almost immediately falls under suspicion as being involved in her disappearance. Search parties are organized, the cops question Nick, clues indicating his guilt appear, Nick goes on talk shows, he is tried in the press, reporters camp outside his house and harass him, a diary of Amy's is found indicating he physically and verbally abused her. Etc. Etc. Etc. All this is related by Amy and Nick in alternating chapters.<br /><br />But guess what! Surprise, surprise--Amy hasn't really been abducted! She cleverly staged her disappearance by faking the crime scene and leaving clues--as well as a fake diary--the cops would find that would implicate Nick. (We know how clever she is because she reminds us ad nauseum throughout her part of the narrative.) Why did she do this? Well, it turns out she's a sociopath. A beautiful, albeit quite looney woman who is trapped in an unhappy marriage to a philandering cad of a husband.<br /><br />Sound interesting? It's not! It's boring! The characters are dull, one-dimensional, and completely unlikeable. You'd think a raving lunatic would spark a bit of interest--but Amy does not. Everyone she knows is beneath her contempt: Her chic New York friends, the salt-of-the-earth midwest types she meets when her husband forces her to relocate to Missouri prior to her \\"disappearance.\\" Her parents. Everyone. No one escapes a snarky remark. This gets old quickly. And the cops who interview Nick are just cardboard cutouts of real cops--as if the author watched one episode of Law and Order to get a feel for how the police would investigate a crime.<br /><br />And then there's Nick. The only thing he can do is fall victim to Amy's evil machinations, meanwhile complaining what a harridan he's married to.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the amateurish plot development. Example: After Amy frames Nick and disappears, she goes into hiding at an obscure camp with log cabins in the middle of nowhere. And then what happens to this clever woman who managed to frame her husband for her disappearance and faked her death by attending to every last detail she thought would help to cement his arrest? She allows a couple of two-bit hillbillies to steal her hoard of cash she managed to save up! Amy constantly reminds the reader how smart and clever she is, and how stupid is everyone else. So how does she allow this to happen?<br /><br />Amy then enlists the help of a high school beau (he also turns out to be a nut, by the way) who's always been infatuated with her. But to what end? To get back to Nick, whom she now decides has become the husband worthy of her. (She catches him mooning about her on various talk shows).<br /><br />Why did I keep reading? Well, despite the many flaws in the novel, I did want to find out what happened. I really was hoping for a killer ending--no pun intended. Yet another disappointment. The book just ends. Pointlessly. There's no AHA! moment, no one gets her comeuppance, there's no clever plot twist that made this whole ordeal worthwhile. Nothing. And I mean nothing!<br /><br />Gone Girl is a bad novel. It is not a thriller or a whodunit. It's an overlong dissection of a marriage between two uninteresting people, one of whom happens to be a sociopath--but a boring one. There is nothing to recommend about it. It is a complete waste of time and paper. I'm annoyed that I spent time reading it, and I'm annoyed at its publication. I am sure other, worthy books remain unpublished because this one managed to make it onto the shelves.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.

0345802934|5.0|I found this trilogy mesmerizing...the perfect escape. I couldn't put it down, and I didn't want it to end...for those who still like to hold an actual book in your hands, the boxed set is a must.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I had a issue a while back, I was using a laptop as a media server and one day it just stopped sending data but had no issues receiving, after several hours treating and trying every thing and nothing seemed to be the issue the only problem left was it must have some thing to do with the Internet after testing the modem and the router and all was well it must be a crowded network<br /><br />I ran accross this app on the google play store also after reading others I installed and ran and it turned out there was a lot more wireless networks in my area than I could have even imagined, turned out the side of the house I had it on there were 6 networks as I walked around the with the Ouse I realized there was 8 with some over lap on the other side and no matter were I went it was crowded, but no one was using channel 6 so I switched the router to that and have had no issues since and nearly doubled by speed.<br /><br />I have kept this app and randomly check the area to see if channel 6 starts to get crowded so far it's not, a very good with detailed information that even shows graphs in fluctuation of the wireless networks and also who is secure and who isn't which could be useful in detecting how protected you are also. Very highly recommended I have not had the issues most here claim
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|At first angry birds reminded me of suicide bombers. These cartoon characters are rocketing themselves into groups of pigs, only to disappear in a puff of feathers themselves ?! What was I suppose to think?! Maybe I had been watching too much news, because no one else I knew was making the weird connection. However after I got over the eerie coincidence, I found the game to be very entertaining and at times slightly addictive.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I loved the first book. It was a great story, however the other books failed to have the same power as the first. The story degraded into a typical scifi tale, with predictable turns and twists. If the author had been able to keep up the suspense and novelty of the first book through out, I think it would have been great. I for one, do not like to have all the details of a story laid out. I want to wonder about the story and ponder the what and whys of the story. I want a story that keeps me thinking about it long after I have finished reading. Unfortunately, this one fell short.
0385344333|2.0|This is a Jack Reacher novel.  If you have read Reacher novels in the past then you look for a certain level of action through-out the book.  What we are treated to is a little mystery and a very long drive through the night through corn fields and empty roads.  Drive drive talk talk.  By page 75-100 I'm ready to bale.  BUT. this is a Jack Reacher novel.  Have faith.  The suspense should be building....or not.  Finally, by page 350 Jack Reacher hears a gun shot!  Finally, our hero will be unleashed and he will go into action.  And he does. And then the book ends. And I'm left with egg on my face because I read a long torturous 400 pages.  Perhaps this is the story Tom Cruise will try on as the dwarf goes to war on film.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|The film was rather long and kept you watching, so 5 stars would probably be appropriate. Many have complained it didn't follow the book, but who cares - it is only fiction.  Some have commented on the \\"bread and circuses\\" atmosphere of the film, but it was more like \\"circuses\\" without the bread unless you happened to be one of the selected gladiators.  On the other hand it was a nice look into the future of American turning into a modern day Rome with the military made of professionals and not citizens, a broken economy with the rich getting richer and the poor becoming poorer, and sharp class distinction with the elite ruling. This could be the US in 2020 after almost 8 years of Romney rule engaging in foreign wars at the drop of a hat, securing the nation's economy for the top 1%, and bowing to the influence of every right wing wacko that gets his ear.  Of course, Donald Sutherland seemed a bit more reasonable and decisive as a leader and was certainly a much better actor. The sequel should be interesting - maybe it will all be a bad dream.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|We have a male who is open about having been in love with a man before. Yes, we have Adam Lambert, Elton John and the like, but it seems like no black guys want to admit to this (although I know there are tons in the industry who just don't admit it). I find it entirely refreshing how Frank presented his open letter to the world through his Tumblr page. I read the whole thing and thought it was awesome and then some.<br /><br />Now, that all is great and dandy but how is the music? It would do little good if Mr. Ocean presented all of that but had terrible music. Let me just say the album doesn't disappoint. It's not standard R&B fare and is eclectic in sound. It's not perfect and in a couple of spots the melodies aren't as catchy as they should be, but the content more than makes up for it in quality and weight. The lyrics aren't just thrown together and nonsensical. There is much thought put into them. There is a serious mid and downtempo feel to most of the songs so if you need uptempos galore this is not the album for you and maybe you should stick to the Beyonc&eacute;'s, Chris Brown's and the like. Now I love Beyonc&eacute; and have liked some of Chris's music, but these artists make music that is strictly for the charts. This album while definitely hyped, is anything but typical. It has a heart and goes out of its way to even include an audience that sometimes gets ignored (the gay community). While the album doesn't always cater to that audience it does take notice of it on more than one occasion. Ocean makes it evident that he was/is crazy about a guy in a couple of songs such as in \\"Thinkin' Bout You\\" and \\"Forest Gump\\". Those are far from the only highlights though. \\"Sweet Life\\" has its own unique midtempo groove and the vocal arrangements are inviting. \\"Super Rich Kids\\" is even more impressive with its view on the financially fortunate and their privileged lives. It's possibly my pick for best track on the album and definitely in my top 3 favorites if not.<br /><br />As you can see by the content of the review, I'm super psyched about this album even 2 months after its release. I'm elated to see that there's a guy out there that is representing someone like me and the other millions of guys that don't really have many male voices to express the same way they feel in music/art form. This album has a mix of off kilter R&B, I believe some electronic elements and some rap in it also. There are some lyrics that point to homosexuality but it's definitely not overwhelming and kept in decent taste. Obviously, there is also adult language on the version I'm reviewing but there is an alternate clean version available too. Again, while not a perfect release this album will probably go down as an album that was hyped in 2012 but for all the right reasons. I guarantee that some won't \\"get\\" this and that's somewhat understandable. But many will adore it. John Mayer, Andr&eacute; 3000 and Earl Sweatshirt are featured on the album's tracks. The latter two artists perform vocally while John Mayer only plays guitar on the short instrumental \\"White\\".<br /><br />4.6 stars.>As you can see by the content of the review, I'm super psyched about this album even 2 months after its release.

1451627297|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend, and after a few months I finally decided to read it. I do enjoy Steohen King's departures from what he's generally written, but I'm not a Kennedy/conspiracy theorist fan. This was way before my time, so while I knew the reviews on the book were great, I was hesitant. This book was awesome! It seemed slightly iffy that the diner proprietor picked the narrator-I didn't feel there was much build up to suggest much of a previous relationship, but that was easy to ignore, and when the narrator went back in time, you could clearly get the sense that King had enjoyed writing the narrator's POV from the 50's-60's. I thought the ending was unexpectedly sad, but the underlying message of the tiniest actions leading to who and where we are was good. You can't change the past, only your present, and it all affects the future. You don't have to be a Kennedy fan to enjoy this book. But I will say, while this book isn't scary, there's a certain creepiness to it, especially certain references that are made to a previous King book. I'll just say, Derry, Maine makes an appearance.

B00008OE4W|5.0|Robert Redford plays a guy who starts out as a hacker in the 1960's.  Twenty odd years later he heads a close-knit group for hire by banks and whatnot who want their security systems tested to the limit.  I knew guys like that in college, one of whom was hired by the university computer center after he hacked its Univac 1108 as a high school student.  Others guys I knew developed an algorithm that found the masters keys to virtually every university building.  Redford's character and cohorts, played by Dan Aykroyd (as an eccentric conspiracy kook) and Sydney Poitier (as a level-headed old hand who they have given the nickname \\"mother\\"), find more than just irate university administrators threatening to shut down their honors dorm!  A vast conspiracy is afoot and its aim is to break into every computer system in the world and suck out vast sums of money at its leisure--and only Redford and his buddies stand in its way!

1439102430|4.0|I still enjoyed this book, but after reading some of the reviews, I have to somewhat agree with them.  I am not a fan of the TV show \\"Bones\\".  I find it affected and the character that plays Tempe is not likeable and not believable.  And I have noticed since that show has been on TV, the novels are suffering somewhat.  I think Ms. Reich changed her writing style to be more like a screen writer than a novel writer, and the two are very different indeed.  Most television scripts are written for an average Grade 9 age group and maturity.  That is how they get the most people interested to watch.  Novels are not like that and nor should they be.  We expect detailed character development, a sophisticsted plot and superior writing skills.  We used to get that with Tempe Brennan books.  Now, maybe not so much.  Even so, I did enjoy the book because of the superior forensic details and I loved the setting.  I have lived near Edmonton Alberta for many years so it was wonderful to see it portrayed so well in this book.  We also got a close look at Yellowknife NWT and that was interesting as well.  And I didn't mind the information on gold and diamond mining,  I always find I learn things when I read a Kathy Reichs book.  I didn't care for the ending as it seemed rushed and contrived, but the rest of the book was acceptable.  I will continue to read this series, and continue not to watch \\"Bones\\".

1606995359|5.0|The difference between a Bugs Bunny cartoon and one with Huckleberry Hound is that the former can still be enjoyable to an adult viewer while the latter is strictly kids' stuff.  The target audience for Carl Barks's Uncle Scrooge comics is children, but even an adult first-time reader like myself can find them very fun.<br /><br />Unlike many classic Disney characters, Uncle Scrooge (also known as Scrooge McDuck) didn't really make a transition from comics to cartoons until relatively late, but he remains a familiar figure in the Disney universe.  Obviously based on Ebenezer Scrooge (but only loosely), Uncle Scrooge is wealth incarnate, the sort to make a Bill Gates or Warren Buffett seem like impoverished by comparison; on page one of this collection, he is described as having \\"umpteen-centrifugilillion\\" dollars.<br /><br />Being a miser, Scrooge keeps his money close at hand, the easier to swim in it.  It also makes him super-stingy and super-paranoid about theft, although this proves to be an appropriate feeling considering the many heist attempts by adversaries like the Beagle Boys.<br /><br />Typically, the stories within this edition are divided into two sorts:  one-page, one joke strips and longer (around 30 page) mini-epics with support by Donald, Huey, Dewey and Louie.  These sagas are where Barks truly shines, both with truly imaginative art and with equally clever stories.<br /><br />In short, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy Uncle Scrooge if Carl Barks is the one writing and illustrating it; this is fun stuff for people of all ages.

B009329ZF2|3.0|This movie is obviously aimed at a very young and completely unaware group of viewers, otherwise it's just an insult to the intelligence. While I can believe aliens would regard our species as a pest to be exterminated, the main character of this movie is not even acceptable. Navy, accept into the officer ranks a man as far out of control as this young man? Please. Then the final solution break out the floating museuum and use it to destroy the alien fleet. Please. Where does the fuel come from for those boilers, where did they find the munitions for those big 15 inch guns, and how in hell did they manage to float that massive vessel with so few men?

B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is a delightful story that will definitely appeal to anyone who feels<br />they would like to escape their boring daily retired life and be challenged to do so without too much<br />planning and finding excuses not to be adventurous.  The characers are well rounded and believable.<br />The story is also slightly allegorical without being too preachy. I loved it.
1416583408|2.0|The prose in this book is painful to read. VERY painful. Perhaps if it was written more clearly, it would have filled only a handful of pages. When one muddles through the tortured prose, there are some insights - most are not given much exposition, though. Some wonderful insights are just dropped inexplicably half way through exploration.<br /><br />While it has given me a new perspective on dogs, that insight was gained only by holding my nose to the disjointed writing style. The editor should be deeply ashamed of this work.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a psychology experiment conducted on the reader...
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Stop. Before you publish that next website, read this book. It's a quick read, only a few hours, but it'll save you days or weeks of headaches later on. It's way too easy to stop thinking as a user when you're designing a website, and Steve Krug's book kicks you right back into a user's point of view and explains how and why you should stay there when designing.

B0087HT36U|5.0|Angry Birds frustrates me because even if I get the physics of solving the puzzle, then the chance of me aiming and getting the bird to the right place is minimal.  These puzzles are eeringly similar, but the stone, bomb, oil, etc. go where you aim.  And I'm anti-violence but I don't mind going after these cartoons.  You won't miss the giggling, grunting pigs.  Well done.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|I had always heard alot of hype about this game but never really seen or played it.<br />I seen the ad-supported version but I find the ads on most things too annoying or distracting so I try to avoid them.<br />Then I lucked up on this ad-free version as \\"app of the day\\" and finally purchased/downloaded it.<br />Fun little game that definately lives up to the hype and is worth the purchase.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|great app with lots of good sounds. combo options. timers. and fun other options. eats battery like crazy but if u plug ur phone at night &amp; use it its awesome

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There are the rare books that pull you in and won't let you go. You're hooked from the first sentence, and after that you're well and truly caught. The first time for me, I think, was in fourth grade. I was on a rare trip to the bookstore with my mother and spotted a book called Stone Voice Rising. I sat down and read a few pages. Then I sat there for another two hours with my mom nagging at me and my sister tugging at my shirt and finished it. Ever since then, I've had on and off love affairs with books. The times I discovered The Hunger Games and yes, Twilight were sleepless nights for me. When I was sucked into a story, I would read that book everywhere-between periods at school, at lunch, at home, late at night in bed when I could barely keep my eyes open, and [once] riding on my bicycle on my way home from school. I won't be trying that again. I saw this book on the 25 exciting books list and wondered whether to take a look or not. The cover was kinda interesting but I had just been let down by seven other reviews before it. Buying it was one of my best decisions. I didn't even look at the price, though then again, it was my dad's account. I was pulled in from the first sentence. Do not hesitate to buy this book.
044655667X|5.0|I read my first Michael Connelly novel when The Lincoln Lawyer came out.  Everybody enjoys a book written about their own chosen profession, and I'm no exception.  As a criminal defense attorney, and a member of that much maligned and heavily despised group known as \\"bar advocates\\", I couldn't wait to get my hands on The Lincoln Lawyer, and I was not disappointed.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much I read all the Harry Bosch books as well!<br /><br />And then I read The Fifth Witness.  Anybody who gives it less than five stars can't possibly be a defense attorney, or a prosecutor, or a police officer, the victim of a foreclosure, or even, I imagine, a judge.  Michael Connelly is dead on in every detail of this mystery: the tactics of the defense and the prosecution in the courtroom, the behavior of the judge, the very nature of the lead detective in the case, the young associate from a second rate law school determined to prove her worth, and especially the obnoxious behavior of the defendant, who never really seems to grasp the trouble she's in.  Mickey Haller is the hero in this book, the one who is struggling to keep his client safe, at whatever cost to himself and despite her best (and entirely unconscious) efforts to thwart him. Andrea Freeman, the prosecutor, cold, ruthless, and an extraordinarily skilled attorney, is a formidable adversary.<br /><br />Sure, it's a great plot.  I never anticipated the outcome, not for a minute, but the plot was just part of what made this book so good. What made it great, for me anyway, was how entirely familiar it was, like sitting second chair in a courtroom not my own, and watching a fascinating murder case unfold.  There wasn't a single false note in the book that jarred me out of that fantasy of being there.  I loved it!<br /><br />Brockton, MA not Morocco, sigh...
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting and disturbing, especially if you have kids....I really liked it and will probably try another of his books.  I don't want to give anything away, but you never know....
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yes it $7 but trust me it is worth it. $7 is the same price for IOS, android, and amazon appstore so they will not lower it. It is hands down the best app there is so the price is definitely worth it!

B00931JMRE|2.0|I love ZZ Top, have all their albums on vinyl and digital (you can track down original versions of the first 6 albums online sans added drum echo), but something went far awry with this one.  I am really disappointed with this, particularly after all the hype and build up to release.  Besides the total lack of groove except for Chartreuse, the real bummer here is the production.  This album is the poster child for the Loudness Wars.  Everything is so compressed and limited that there are no dynamics left at all and everything is highly distorted.  The EQ scoping is ridiculous as well, basically a flat across the board boost all the way up.  The songs themselves are really uninspired too.  Flyin' High has been floating around on youtube for awhile now, and it was actually pretty good.  Unfortunately for this album, they completely gutted the track.  The only guitar left are some chunk chords ala AC/DC.  Rick Rubin should be ashamed of himself.

B000SEFM6K|4.0|The characters in the book are really brought to life by the detailed descriptions the author presents.<br />For this reason, it is a rather slow read. Once into the mystery that surrounds the characters, I<br />found myself fascinated and eager to learn more about what was driving them.

1423124111|5.0|I am a Disney fanatic so I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this book for a couple of years.  It certainly has lived up to my expectations and then some.  It has quickly become the favorite book in my extensive Disney library.  The quality of the printing is second to none.  The colors are bright and the images crystal clear.  It's as if they were able to print the book in HD!  I love this book so much I ordered a second copy to take apart so I can frame some of the images.  They are really that good.  Hopefully they will release a sequel someday with even more amazing poster art.

I have more room in my bunk now because I no longer have to make room for all my books.  I don't know who thought of the kindle, but he or she needs a gold star and a new party hat!

0375507256|4.0|If you ever had any writing aspirations, you might have finished reading certain books and thought \\"Hey, I could do that.\\" The stories are competently but not memorably told, the characters familiar. If someone saw fit to publish this book, there's hope for my manuscript too! Then there are the novels you marvel at, the epics (\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" springs to mind), the ones that leave you with a sinking feeling, two parts jealousy, one part depression. David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" falls into this latter category. The first section is written in the style of an eighteenth century Defoe-like journal. The writing is dense, but don't despair. This initial section gives way to others that are more user-friendly. The author gives us six different narratives, each leaping forward in time, each ending in medias res before Mitchell eventually doubles back to conclude the stories, so that the narrative's chronology is like a boomerang, eventually ending where it began, with the journal of an American notary aboard a ship sailing the South Pacific. Mitchell mixes different modes and styles. While the first section consists of journal entries, the book also includes an epistolary section, a section of memoir, an interview section. The author seems equally adept at each. Even when he's depicting hitmen and car chases (as in the bit about a journalist seeking to uncover a conspiracy at a nuclear power plant), Mitchell's prose is crisp and unpredictable; the higher aspirations are there. The risk of such a narrative, involving multiple characters, storylines, and time periods, is its disruption of the reader, who can never truly settle in and get comfortable. For the most part, Mitchell overcomes these inherent dangers by keeping the narratives lively. While in one section a native tribesman is pursued by savages bent on enslaving him, another depicts a replicant's (i.e. clone's) efforts to evade capture by the human authorities to whom she poses a threat. Even the selection about an elderly book editor's escape from a nursing home becomes a lively read. The various sections are only loosely tied together. Certain characters share a comet-shaped birthmark (hinting at themes of reincarnation). The young composer in 1930's Belgium stumbles onto the notary's journal; the sixties-era reporter tracks down the composer's \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\"; The elderly editor's memoir is made into a film viewed by the replicant, who in turn becomes deified by the tribesman living in a post-apocalyptic world. It sounds crazy, and is, but these linkages also make Mitchell's novel compulsively readable. The storylines are unified not just by the details that bleed from one narrative to the next but also by the overarching theme, which concerns itself with the abuses of power. The book is not a polemic or a curative. Mitchell appears to feel the abuses are inevitable. Still, the book ends on a hopeful note. Faced with the question of what any one man can do in the face of such oppression, the author compares the individual to a drop in a limitless ocean but states that an ocean is merely \\"a multitude of drops.\\"
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I must say that besides the fact that most of this cast was simply miscast (Charlize overacting could have been anyone), and as the storyline became more and more absurd, it was the fact that the dwarves were CGI heads that finally got me...really? You honestly couldn't find any real little people to act as the dwarves?<br /><br />Other than that the rest of the reviewers sum it up nicely although I think this was not a good role for Charlize.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Never was a fan of 'Angry Birds'.  I did enjoy this game.  Made it to &quot;The Age of the Cowboy&quot; without having to make ANY in-game purchases.  Some reviewers are saying that the game increases in difficulty and in-game purchases become needed.  I thought games were supposed to get harder as you progress.  Thank you to Amazon.com for making this a FAOTD, and thank you Miniclip.com for the game itself.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I enjoyed this book for some of the great compostional imagery and the ability to bring me to a new time and place.  The characters were likeable although not fully-developed.  Many of my book club members had a hard time getting into the book until half way through but the vibe was at least majority on the positive side.  Not a phenomenal storyline and sometimes the plot or storyline was confusing or difficult to understand where the author was going but in terms of being able to relax and enjoy a story the book was effective.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster consumed me. This is one of those books that pulls you in and doesn't release you until you have finished it. Have you ever read a book that's so good you can't wait to finish it? But when you finish it, you're sad because it's finished. I took my time a little bit with this book, because I know the second one isn't out yet or won't be out until next April. So as much as it consumed me, I just read it at bedtime. This book is so so good. I know this book has many mixed reviews but my review will be a raving one.<br /><br />  I'll start off with Travis. Travis has a bit of a obsessive personality. When he loves he loves hard. When he hates, he hates hard. So whatever he feels about something whether it being good or bad, he felt it strong. So needless to say when he fell in love with Abby, he loved her with every fiber of his being. Now that's where people consider this dysfunctional and I can totally understand that. And to some degree, I agree, but I also believe that some people just love hard. I love Travis. This character actually made me feel bad for him. I understood his past which made me understand why he is the way he is.<br /><br />  Abby took me by surprise. I liked that she was a strong minded girl and stood her ground with Travis. She wasn't at all what I expected. Most characters in most contemporary stories get all mushy and aren't strong at all. She knew how to handle Travis like no one else. She didn't cower to him at all. She held her own just about anywhere she went. And that's something you have to admire in a character.<br /><br />  I absolutely loved this book. But I have to say that I'm completely shocked at the ending. I didn't think it would end that way. The author really took the ending and ran with it. Though in Beautiful Disaster you do witness some obsessive and possessive behavior it doesn't take away from the story. The story is about two people with different lifestyles, who fell in love. I give this book 5 huge gold stars and a definite Good Choice for Reading!!<br /><br />[...]Good Choice for Reading!!    [...]
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I'll be honest. I was going to leave a 3 star review for Slammed when I finished it last night, but I left the actual reviewing until today when I could be more coherent. Then I came onto the Slammed page...and saw that there is a follow on book.<br /><br />I read the description and it dawned on me. Falling asleep last night, and then again as I rushed getting my kids off to paintball, did my errands, etc. I had been thinking back to moments from Slammed. Eddie's birthday party. Lake reorganizing everything, the very real, very human (by which I mean flawed and fabulous) characters that inhabit this world. And I clicked \\"Buy now on Kindle\\" even though I've already bought the next book on my To Be Read list.<br /><br />Any book strong enough to capture that reaction in me is automatically given my highest rank...4 stars (why I don't leave 5 star reviews is a story for another time.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this emotional roller coaster of a book that makes you laugh, cry, cheer, and sigh. Hell, sometimes I was laughing *as* I was crying. Lake's dealt a few really hard blows in the course of a few months and yes, she's a strong heroine and she battles through them...but she also breaks a little along the way. Those breaks, to me, made the story so much more real. Yes, I wanted to shake Lake at times... but that's the adult in me forgetting what 18 feels like.<br /><br />Well done and I can't wait for tonight when errands are done, family is settled, and I can settle in with my Kindle and re-enter this world to see what's in store for Lake and Will this time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|An enjoyable game. The help feature helped me learn the game and how to develop a strategy. Each time I play I get a little more savvy.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This game is the most epic pinball game i have ever played. It is fun to play in the car on the way to somewhere or when you need to kill some time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I think there are many books better than this one. It is very entertaining but sex content is too explicit. I think there should be a restriction on who buys this book, for I have heard 14 and 15 year old students that are reading it and I think they are not mature enough for some details. If you are a parent, read it first. This is not a romantic novel :(
B003B96AOW|5.0|I absolutely lover this figure. The detail is downright beautiful, and it's just as functional. Comes with plenty of weapons, as well as places to hold them! It moves pretty well, and pose-ability is just fine. The standee background is pretty cool as well. Honestly, the only thing that could make this better would be if he spoke. Otherwise, this is a top-notch action figure. I bought it originally as a decoration for a friend's birthday cake, but now I think I want one for myself!<br />Seriously, you won't be disappointed.
0307956350|4.0|Kate is a mess.  She has moments in which she is composed, shrewd, smart, and together.  But her frailties, both real and imagined, make her a bit of a mess.  She keeps the nature of her career from her husband and children, compartmentalizing her work from her marriage, and her past from her present.  Though she believes that her lies are the big ones, she is blind to the lies being told and lived around her.<br /><br />What I love about Kate as the protagonist in 'The Expats' is exactly that she is a flawed character, subject to very human errors.  Some others suggest that her flaws are representative of poor writing on Mr. Pavone's part, but I would argue that they portray a genuinely conflicted and imperfect woman.  She is indeed somewhat incapable of routine social interaction, never mind intimacy.<br /><br />But I think that 'The Expats' is a great read because Kate is worth rooting for as a protagonist.  Her success, or even survival, are not automatic; she is no James Bond spy who we all know will come out on top, no matter what.  The plot itself, which unfolds in interlacing scenes from the present and the recent past, is really the strength of the book: Here's an interesting character in a difficult situation, and I absolutely want to know how she's going to survive it.<br /><br />This is a compelling read.  Enjoy the ride, and let the layers unfold.  Forgive Kate her shortcomings, her foolishness, and her mistakes, and see if she'll be your friend, or if she'll prove too much the fool indeed....
B00005JKHP|2.0|This 1979 motion picture, based on the Star Trek television series, was intended to be the answer to the prayers of the heartbroken fans of the television series that was canceled in 1969 after three seasons on NBC.  The film has basically the same cast as the television series but was a high budget motion picture undertaking.  This is a very slow moving film which seems to last considerably longer than its 2:16  running time.  It shares certain similarities with earlier science-fiction theatrical films, notably Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968).<br /><br />To say that the acting is generally stiff in this film would be an understatement.  William Shatner embarrassingly overacts in this production to the extent that his character, Captain James Kirk, is thoroughly obnoxious through most of the film.  The story seems to be of a seemingly endless  journey through the Universe to reach a source of energy that is suspected to be a threat to the security of the earth.  The star ship Enterprise passes through strange formations and lights, reminding one of the psychedelic light-effects seen in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" but taking much more time and having none of the artistry and imagination of the earlier film.  The ship finally passes through what can only be described as a galactic sphincter into a cosmic colon which contains this alien energy force which turns out to be SPOILER COMING UP! the space probe Voyager Six originally launched by NASA some 300 years prior to the time setting of the film.<br /><br />This is apparently the \\"Director's Edition\\" running  slightly longer than the original release.  The film, in Blu-ray, looks and sounds very impressive but must be, with one exception, judged from the standpoint of direction and acting as being significantly inferior to the five films having the same cast that would follow it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game it is very fun. I think everyone should play this game. I can play this all day.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is a great series with a good cast of characters, and great story and i really nice ending.  However, I will say that it seemed like Wool 1 was just an absolutely amazing short story, that the author decided to build into a series of stories, in a novel like manner.  Wool 1 has every thing that a great short story needs, its short, it has a great central character and plot with enough depth for the reader to be pulled in, without all the extraneous backstory that muddies up the works.  If you read Wool 1 and don't love it, then you probably just don't dig dystopian science fiction.  So, thats Wool 1, but what about 2-5, well, thats where things get interesting.  Wool 2, in my opinion, is fluff, it doesn't push the story forward, and of the 3 central characters, only the least of them moves forward with the story.  Wool 2 introduces our new protagonist Juliette, and antagonist Bernard, that we will have to endure for the remainder of the series.  Wool 3, 4, and 5 are all good, getting better as the story processes.  Its here in 3-5 where we really get into the meat of this story, and where the book starts to shine again.  By the time I had reached book 5, I had already put the tedium of book 2 out of my mind and could enjoy this rich story.  If I had to put star ratings for each book, it would go:  Wool 1: 5 stars, 2: 2 stars, 3: 4 stars, 4: 5 stars, 5: 5 stars.<br /><br />Overall, I give it the series 4 stars, and now something just for my sheer curiosity.  The author says he reads every Amazon review for his book, if thats true then, hello Mr. Howley, I just wanted to say this was an amazing series, I really enjoyed it, and I hope you continue to expand on this story because I think you have a really great idea with this.  I don't think you have to live in a silo in a post apocalyptic wasteland to understand the kind of fear and isolation that the characters deal with.  Great job!

B0053O89KG|5.0|This season has got to be my favorite so far (I can say that since the fifth hasn't aired yet). It makes you want to laugh til you cry at Castle's jokes and mistakes and morn with Beckett when she meets more set backs with her recovery. I only saw each episode once before the season came out on DVD so each one is like a brand new episode and it is certainly keeping me busy until the premier!

B0098VYEYA|5.0|Spartacus: Vengeance opened up something for everyone, outside the arena and intrigues of a small group of men. It runs parallel to the legend of Spartacus, which grew from slave rebel to the epitome of the noble rebel in modern mindset.<br /><br />This episode introduction of Lucius is a master stroke and I hope they remember this for the final season. No all Romans are evil slaveowners or enfranchised elites. People like Lucius were part of the rebellion too, because they were forced from their homes, their families murdered by Roman politics, and they had nothing more to lose like the slaves.<br /><br />It's also a good lesson in modern politics, don't force people into the wall or else they might join the most extreme elements of your society.
B00992CF6W|3.0|in block story I can sit there for hours just mining for stone as you can do in minecraft. well Intel your pickaxes breaks. blockstory has more weapons better armor. better graphics. and a better plot. and for that reason I prefer block story. but at the same time mineceaft is easier to build on and mine with better fighting because its not turn based
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I was looking forward to a fun racing game, with the old school characters I remember from long ago. What I got was a game that is very frustrating just to try to control, along with one track!!! You have to buy the full version ($2.99!!!!!!) To get any other tracks!!The sensitivity of the accelerometer should be able to be adjusted.I would love to see an update, where the kart is easier to control, along with other weapons. you seem to get the drill way too much, please make this worth the three bux you got for it!! And I Will change my rating to the five stars it could actually earn!!

B007URVZJ6|1.0|If this is meant to be for a beginner, then it is far too complicated. I would not recommend it
B006YC74E8|5.0|Now I can have a nice camera on my favorite tablet (Kindle Fire HD)! The effects are easy to use and the frames look good. I would like a cropping tool in a future upgrade. Nice app!
0525953728|5.0|Here is my review of the book.  It's not Hemingway, no, but I didn't buy it for that reason. As a history buff and war veteran I have read several \\"on-the-ground\\" books, several about various special ops groups/missions.  This is one of the better ones that I have read.  The author(s) give you a lot of background and insight of how difficult it is to become a SEAL and that's its hard to move up the ranks once you become one.  I enjoyed reading of his personal experiences which I think added flavor to the book.<br /><br />The author made certain that terminology was understandable for the non-military or non-special ops reader.  He also shared the special camaraderie the men of these units have.  The book moved along well as I found myself finishing it in only a couple of nights.  Despite the erroneous hoopla spewed by the main stream media, there was NO \\"top secret\\" info contained in the book that endangered any members of our armed forces.  The intelligence information leaked by the Obama administration WAS information that NEVER should have been released and may well cause the lives of American troops.<br /><br />In my view, the book is a great read if you are interested in reading a first-hand account of what happened in the the events leading up, as well as the actual take-down of UBL.<br /><br />Okay, end of actual review of book, but read further for a little insight about some criticisms made by a few reviewers and some in the media.<br /><br />Here are few points about the \\"politics\\" not only concerning the book, but embedded in some of the so-called reviews.  As another reviewer mentioned, there was much less than 1% of anything dealing with Obama. If you are wondering about all the hoopla from the MSM as well as the DOD and the Obama administration, here a just a couple of facts to consider.  Yes, the author (and many other in the military) were not pleased that Obama and the DNC has used this for political purposes and Mark said as much in the book.  Also, the reason that Team Obama and the MSM are upset is that if you do read the book, you will find that Obama had very, very little to do with the taking down of UBL.  You wouldn't have gathered that watching the Democratic Convention.<br /><br />The book traces critical intelligence that was rooted in and grew from what was gathered from terrorists who were captured during the Bush administration. That information came via interrogation methods CONDEMNED by Obama. If he been president at that time, UBL may still be on the loose today.  Sure, Obama approved the mission, and though I give him credit for that, what president in their right mind WOULDN'T have given the go-ahead?  If the crucial new intel had come while Bush was President and he had given the orders, I wouldn't give him any more credit, either.  It was our intelligence agencies and methods that eventually found UBL, and it was the brave troops like the author who risked their lives to make it happen.<br /><br />Also, there lingers that \\"threat of potential prosecution\\" of the author by the DOD.  But, you might want to know who is the General Counsel of the Department of Defense who is suggesting any prosecution?  Why, it's Mr. Jeh Johnson.  And who is Jeh Johnson?  A search reveals:<br /><br />\\"Johnson is active in Democratic Party politics, as a fundraiser and adviser to presidential campaigns. Johnson served as special counsel to John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, and was active in Barack Obama's presidential campaign as a foreign policy adviser and as a member of his national finance committee...\\"  And guess who appointed him as General Counsel for the DOD?  Yep, BHO himself.<br /><br />Well, well, no politics in THAT suggestion to prosecute, eh?  Team Obama, with their many faults, know how to go after anyone who criticizes them and the media are willing water boys/girls eager to help make Obama's spin \\"FACTUAL\\".  Anyway, even if you are a ardent Obama supporter but are interested in the real story of how things went down, you still might enjoy the book.  And to the Obama staff members who are \\"reviewers\\" posting here - shame on you, but I'm sure it's nothing new for you!  And yeah, LONG review, but I warned you!  :-)tory of how things went down, you still might enjoy the book.
