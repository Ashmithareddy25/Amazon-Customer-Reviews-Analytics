B005LAIH2W|5.0|Finally! I have waited sixty years for someone to FINALLY bring John Carter to the big screen. Technology wasn't available when I was young, so it was the library and your own imagination, or nothing. I loved all the John Carter books, and reread them many times. Burroughs fed the imaginations of generations. Sadly, he is missing from most library shelves, replaced by Harry Potter and the Twilight gang.<br /><br />Thank you to Disney studios for doing a great job on an outstanding adventure. Sincerely hope The Gods of Mars and the Warlord of Mars are followups. Great story, great effects, and a great John Carter!

0312641893|5.0|It felt fresh. With all this dark, creepy dystopia on the market today, here's a lighter dystopian book with just as much adventure, romance, and all-around awesomeness! It really didn't feel dystopian at all. There were still the big problems of war and incurable disease, but the characters still had hope, which made the biggest difference.<br /><br />I LOVED all the characters! The good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and the stepmother remained in the middle of the two. I don't want to say that they felt unrealistic, but they weren't completely realistic either. Except for Cinder, all the characters felt like they were slight caricatures of their true selves. This wasn't a bad thing, though. It just made it kind of easier to point out \\"Oh, he's prince charming! And that's the evil person! Oh, and don't forget the fairy god-droid!\\"<br /><br />I know everyone's been talking about that really predictable plot twist. Yeah--it was predictable. And knowing beforehand that there was a predictable twist like that meant that the first time it was even mentioned I totally figured it out.<br />Luckily, that didn't take away from the story at all! The plot never lost excitement, and kept me on my toes throughout it all!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to ANYONE in a heartbeat! It's a fairy tale for the girly girls, with a strong willed cyborg heroine for the not-so-girly girls, and it's got robots and mind-controlling moon people for all the boys!
B00792EGES|4.0|This is a beautiful bluray.  All aspects including including sound, picture, camera angles all put together what a hi-def bluray should look like. It is much better quality than their first bluray, which was also excellent.<br /><br />I do have a complaint, however; which is Myles' unnecessary cursing and lack of finishing the vocals on some of the songs. I understand that its just a live thing, but i do not remember him doing this when seeing them live. Mark, Brian and Scott all get 5 stars for their performances.<br /><br />To this day, Alterbridge remains one of the most underrated bands in all of rock.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So - yes the book is poorly written. However for a totally guilty pleasure, I thoroughly enjoyed it. After all - sometimes we need totally pointless things to get us thru the day! Not everything has to be Jane Austin or Lewis Carroll.<br />And it is just naughty enough to tantalize the darker side that many of us have :-)
B006RUJST6|5.0|After reading the reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try (and also because I go through a lot of books and was looking for something inexpensive).  I'm really glad I did.  Even now that I have finished both, I can't stop thinking about them.  I read the first book in one day, and immediately considered re-reading it.  When I realized the next morning the second book was out already I purchased it immediately (I loved that book too, but this is a review for Slammed).<br /><br />The characters come to life almost immediately.  The story is not complex, but it provides real life challenges, emotions and decisions.  It left me wanting more, which is what I love about reading and why I love to read series books so much.<br /><br />I would not typically choose a Young Adult story to read since I am 40.  However, I loved my high school and college years and perhaps that is why I enjoyed this book so much.  It took me back to my \\"firsts\\" and the excitement and agonies of relationships, life and decisions made - right or wrong.  It reveals what I have come to learn the hard way, through my own experiences - that most things in life aren't easy.  Relationships are hard, life is hard and things usually don't go the way we want them to - but, through acceptance of these realities they can lead to happiness, and, of course, patience is a virtue.<br /><br />(I agree there were some publishing errors, but the content of this book is what I base my rating on)
0439023513|1.0|After reading the first 2 books in the series, I couldn't wait to start the final one. However, it was a total bust! I was beyond disappointed! I continue to ask myself how she could possibly do this to her characters and not to mention her readers... I just hope Hollywood will do a complete \\"re-do\\"! Maybe end it in a somewhat happy manner, rather than as a depressing eyesore...
B00756GKBA|2.0|But I will say this isn't up to par at all with her previous work. For the last 17 years Madonna has always took music to the next level. She always was a innovator and changed the game in many ways. This is nowhere close to even \\"Ray of Light\\". Her past works where more ambient and had a darker effortless sound to it. This album sounds like she is straining with ideas. Even the flow of the album is inconsistent in-cohesive and disoriented.<br /><br /> If you listen to her previous works every song flowed into the next one like a Painting or collage. \\"Gang Bang\\" to me was the closest thing I heard to innovation on this set. \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" is a good song but definitely shouldn't be the opening track. Not sure if Madonna is trying to go back to her 80's era ? Or if she is just running out of steam?  But honestly I like this album the least out of everything I have heard from her so since 1994.<br /><br />  My first album exposure to Madonna was \\"Bedtime Stories\\" every since then I have been a die hard follower. And to me each album showed progression , promise, advancement. I even loved \\"American Life\\" and many felt like \\"Hard Candy\\" was a step down . But I actually really thought the album was great and showed a different range for her and promise to hip hop genre. It was no different from \\"Bedtime Stories in my opinion just newer fresher. The production team on the album were familiar territory. But yet in still she brought her own ideas to their beats and made it hers.<br /><br />  There's nothing on here that can touch \\"Miles Away or \\"Heartbeat\\" Or \\"Devil wouldn't recognize you. Not sure what everyone else is hearing on MDNA but its got to be just a adrenaline rush. Just because she worked with William Orbit again. Doesn't mean this is \\"Ray of Light\\" or some masterpiece. \\"Ray of light\\" had a great ambiance about it and flow. The songs were beautiful and sculptured and timeless pieces art. These songs are poppy happy and sound forced for radio play. Better lucknext album I guess? This just isn't the Madonna I grew up with. Her voice is extremely high on this album and irritating on some of the tracks. And the songs are too light and playful and some are just plain silly. I listened to this album twice and felt it was better than average for sure. But still doesn't have the sophistication of her previous efforts. Honestly ... that isn't saying much for someone of her stature. \\"American LIFE\\" the style was so unique and original like something from another planet. She has really taken a large step down with this.<br /><br />Confessions on the Dance-floor or American Life is where she should return but better.

1400052181|5.0|I realised even after 10 years as a Scientist I had never really given enough thought to the patients behind the breakthroughs. This book offers an incredible insight into the life of Henrietta Lacks who unknowingly changed Science forever. Although her cells have been a source of great revenue for Biotech companies around the world, her family and descendants are unable to pay for basic healthcare in the USA. It opens the discussion and prompts ethical debate on when 'informed consent' is not properly gained in the 'name of science' and just who 'owns' your cells when they are removed? Highly recommend!
B001QOGYFY|3.0|This movie bombed with the critics and at the box office and I'm not sure why.  Well I get why critics panned the movie.  It's poorly written and not very well acted, but what did the audience expect?  Maybe they were thinking this was another remake of \\"The Thing\\", I don't know.  Frankly, once you get past the lame writing and lame premise the movie serves pretty well as a murder-mystery-thriller.  Granted I was able to identify the ultimate bad guy but for the usual reason, the other possibility was just too obvious.  Park your brain and just go for the ride; it won't hurt even if you chuckle when you shouldn't.<br /><br />The 1080p Blu ray conversion is presented in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The look is inconsistent at best.  Some scenes look very good, others murky.  Still, given the harsh outdoors scenes the video is pretty good.  The Dolby TruHD 5.1 on the other hand is excellent.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|I bough this book when I saw the Bro Code at the end of How I Met Your Mother and there are Bro Codes in it that were better than the ones they showed on TV. This is a must get book for any watcher of the show. ALWAYS follow the Bro Code...
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|All of Nolan's previous films are tangled messes (Memento, Insomnia, Inception). In seeking to create a slightly coherent film he has ruined all of the quirkiness and fantastically weird unorthodoxy of what has made Batman a loved and unique character in print and on screen. The irony is that if Nolan had used his prior directorial and writing techniques in creating this trio of Batman films, they would have been much more aesthetically and intellectually captivating: simply, better.<br />The best part of this film was the few seconds long scene when The Joker sticks his head out of the police car window. For that scene, and for that scene only, this film gets one star.
0307463745|5.0|This book is awesome. It's easy to read (anytime of your life) and full of common sense... and I deeply consider common sense :)<br />37signals and Jason Fried are worth knowing, whatever your passion is and whatever your current job is.<br />Since it may be the best book i've ever read, my only advice is: read it! :)
B006OV7S1I|3.0|Put newcomer Elizabeth Olsen on the list of brilliant young actresses filling the movie screen these days.  In this psychological thriller, twentyish Martha Marlene (Olsen) leaves home after her mother dies.  We don't know why, but she severs contact with her older sister, Lucy (excellent Sarah Paulson) who is married to Ted (Hugh Dancy).  Somehow she ends up at a commune of sorts, headed by one of those Charles Manson types, but without the visible menace.  Patrick (good as usual John Hawkes) clearly runs the show for his collective of young women and young men.  What happens to them when they get older?  We do know that occasionally children are born, but against all odds they are always boys.  Hmmm.<br /><br />After Martha (now renamed Marcy May by Patrick) is sexually abused, she decides to slip away into the woods.  She finds her way into town and calls her sister on a pay phone.  It's been 2 years but Martha doesn't know where she is.  She thinks it's in upstate New York.  Huh?  Lucy, at their vacation house in Connecticut, goes to pick up Martha and returns with her to their picture perfect house on a picture perfect lake.  Their primary residence is in New York City where they work.<br /><br />Martha drifts in and out of rational behavior, often reverting to scenes of her experience at the compound.  This gives us some insight of her plight, but we're never quite sure of her state of instability.  I found it unrealistic that she wouldn't remember basic manners or that skinny dipping in front of your just-met brother-in-law would be frowned upon.  After all she was only away for 2 years, but in this time it seems reality has left her.  This leads to paranoia as to whether Patrick and the gang would go after her.  This may be credible as one of her flashbacks involves a random and horrific home invasion perpetrated by Patrick and the girls (more Manson comparisons).<br /><br />While unusual endings are to be expected in film, this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  The fine performances are worth watching.  Technically the movie is excellent.  Great visuals, wonderful cinematography and a creepy score help add to the tension.  Ultimately however, the film leaves much to be desired.  There are too many unanswered questions and not enough clues to help the viewer formulate a hypothesis.  See it for the acting, see it for a remarkable performance by Elizabeth Olsen but don't expect satisfaction.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  I didn't see this film in the theater previously so I'm not sure how much of the post production work mimics the original, but I thought many of the scenes unusually soft with heightened greys and blacks.  I suspect this was the director's intent but it is noticeable.  Other scenes in brightly lit rooms are excellent including facial close-ups, kitchen appliances and the like.  Audio is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is generally solid.  The score opens up the rear speakers along with chirping crickets and other creatures adding to the creepy scenes.<br /><br />Extras include:  Mary Last Scene (1080p, 13:36): Spotlight on Elizabeth Olson (1080p, 2:46): The Story (1080p, 3:41): The Making of Martha Marcy May Marlene (1080p, 3:09):<br />A Conversation with the Filmmakers (1080p, 3:14): The Psyche of a Cult (1080p, 5:06): Marcy's Song Music Video by John Hawkes (1080p, 3:58): Theatrical Trailer (1080p, 2:25)<br />Sneak Peeks (1080p, 13:12)uth.

030788743X|4.0|What do you get if you took World of Warcraft, the Sims, and The Surrogates and mixed them in a blender for 80 seconds? If you said that you'd get a world where you could control your own `Sim' in a huge massively multiplayer online world, where you can go on quests, hang out with friends, and even go to school. And in this world, it allows players to be anything that they wanted to be. A hotter body, sure. An awesome warrior with cool weapons and has huge muscles, of course. A player, in both senses, whatever you want you can get. The world offers a better you, a better life, a better world, so much so that some people spend their entire time in the online world that they forget about the real world.<br /><br />If this was your answer, then you'd be correct. You'd also be correct if you said that you'd get the delightful debut novel, Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline.<br /><br />Ready Player One has a lot of great things going for it. As a gamer, I loved reading about the world that Cline created and seeing how it affected everyday life. Even though I didn't grow up in the 80s, I did get a lot of the pop culture references and what not. Just a note, there is a lot of 80s references. A lot.<br /><br />The story, as a whole, is fairly interesting. On one hand, it's exciting and seeing how Wade figures out the puzzles was fun to read. But on the other hand, the book did tend to tell you things instead of showing them to you. I think with this book it was a bit hard to not have an info dump here and there, because of the nature of the story. I just wish that the info dumps weren't so much. I wanted to read more about what Wade was doing and even learn more about his dystopian world.<br /><br />The characters are a bit hit and miss too. I found Wade annoying and stupid, but he was an interesting character. But I think the main problem is that the good guys are clearly labelled; and therefore, they don't have as much depth to them as I would have liked. The same goes with the bad guys. The Sixers, minus the head honcho, had no personality. The main villain was a touch over the top. You do get some development, but not as much as I'd like.<br /><br />I think my biggest con of this book is the first few pages. In the prologue, Wade tells us that he was the winner of the competition and is writing this book in order to set the record straight. I felt like this kind of took away from the climax of the story. Instead of wondering whether Wade makes it or not, I already knew that he got it. The sense of surprise was taken out.<br /><br />This may seem like I hated the novel, but I didn't. I actually liked the story and felt like Cline did a great job for his debut novel. There are problems, but I did like the premise and the gamer in me had fun reading this. I'll be looking forward to Cline's next novel. Definitely check this one out.
1451683405|5.0|Following in typical Sam-Harris fashion, 'Free Will' is a brilliant, concise treatise on the illusory nature of what he carefully regards as the popular conception of human free will. This is a necessary and meaningful distinction that Harris correctly never tires of making, considering some of the philosophical quagmire on offer of one struggles too long and mightily (and, Harris deftly but humbly shows, needlessly).<br /><br />One can safely lay down the accolades I have above but also not risk pressing the point to say this long essay (or mini-book? I've yet to settle on what exactly to call these non-fiction novellas) is brilliantly concise, which is to say Harris manages a pared-down articulation that includes impressive and pointed arguments against his own position--something he's never been gun-shy about--and manages to rebut them with what always felt like, at least to this reader, a respectful and appropriate amount of consideration while still avoiding the trappings of quicksand.<br /><br />Harris is also found to be keeping the emphasis chiefly on what holding his position dictates in a broad, complex, contentious arena of moral, intellectual, and biological quandaries. Harris' background as a neuroscientist is truly the gem of this essay; his insights specifically about the dual mechanism of the conscious and unconscious mind gave me frequent moments of pause and were occasionally nothing less than staggering. Harris illustrates that scientific proof as well as the evidence available to any honest, introspective person can reveal how beholden we are to our unconscious, which is to say to factors that are of course 'us' in any reasonable sense yet remain completely outside of our control. He shows that while we are able to some extent to control the frameworks and factors fed into both sides of our mind, the impact and result of those variables on what bubbles up from our unconscious--resulting in the apparently 'free' realm of choices available to us consciously--is, occasionally, frighteningly narrow. How free are we in the most mundane of choices? How free are we in a storm of the most important?<br /><br />Without ever succumbing to the pitfalls of guru-esque language or a right-back-where-we-started conclusion, Harris explores how limited we really are, particularly in a culture that so values individualism and freedom, and how the constraints that are realized after shrugging off the illusion of true free will can be legitimately liberating.<br /><br />Philosophers of many stripes will probably be able to satisfy themselves and easy fall-backs in the cradle of determinism, but Harris shows here that missing the broader conception of free will--missing the bigger picture--is an unnecessary and fruitless step in this particular discourse. More compelling (and, I feel, obviously, more legitimate at this stage) are the new questions this grasp of an illusory free will present: what does this conception then mean for an invidiual's sense of self, feelings of one's desires and goals, one's failures and successes? what does this conception mean for an American culture and justice system with often crudely-guised emphases on retribution rather than rehabilitation and protection of the innocent?<br /><br />The questions go on, and once again I feel satisfied that Harris has not concluded this bit of discourse with a restful, self-satisfied arrogance or closure--he's offering more questions than he's claimed to have answered, and that's always a good choice.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Using this on my Kindle Fire, I found it to be very informative and useful. I have not had the problem of crashes that others have had. I have been able to enter multiple locations with no problems. To add a location I went to the location list by clicking on the 3 dot icon on the opening page lower right. I clicked on Locations from the menu that came up. This took me to the list of current locations I had added. To add a location, I clicked on \\"add location\\" at the bottom left of screen. I typed in the new location in the town,state format and hit Go on the virtual keyboard. Once the location search was complete, the new location appeared at the top of the screen-below this location the screen was black and blank. This may be the reason some thought the search had failed, as I initially did. But, when I clicked on this location, it took me to the opening screen and gave me the weather for the new location.<br />I also figured out how to stop the app from running continuously. Hit the 3 dot icon on the opening screen, choose Settings from the menu. This takes you to a Settings menu. Choose Notifications. The two options are Home Location and Off. Choose Off and the app will only update when opened by you while connected to WiFi. If you choose Home Location, it will update at the interval that you have set. To set this interval, choose Notification Interval from this same Settings menu. Choose 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minute intervals. According to the note, by 60 minutes option, this is the best battery life option. I use this option only if severe weather is threatening and I want continuous updates.<br />I used this app during a recent severe weather outbreak and found it very useful. The weather alert, which appeared as a red exclamation point on the opening screen,took me to the National Weather Service bulletin when I clicked on it. The alerts coincided with the alerts on my weather radio as it sounded off with the warnings and watches. I compared the weather radaron the app to the radar on my local TV station and found it was accurate as well. Since I now have a Digital TV, I am often faced with a pixelated picture that breaks up or drops out when severe weather approaches. Not a time you want to loose signal. I felt this app will give me another option for weather alerts and radar.  It serves that purpose well. The weather news link on the settings menu also was very informative on weather news from around the country and the world.

B0029QRA1U|1.0|After processing one album, I did not use the software I had installed for two weeks, whilst I was busy ordering more vinyl to create MP3s.<br /><br />Fatal error.<br /><br />For some reason in my two weeks of non-use, the software crashed. Evidently I must have expressed the profound stupidity of having the gall to process something other than the Ion turntable and iTunes software through my PC in the past two weeks.(2009 Compaq, with Windows XP) How dare I use my PC for anything else?<br /><br />iTunes has not forgiven me.<br /><br />I have just given up after spending the last six hours trying to re-establish a connection with spontaneously \\"lost' and unresponsive iTunes software that comes with this turntable, including two hours to complete a simple \\"REMOVE PROGRAMS\\" task that obviously has not worked.<br /><br />I have now given up, stuck, hopelessly on an error message:<br /><br />\\"THE FOLDER PATH \\"PROGRAM FILES\\"  CONTAINS AN INVALID CHARACTER. THE INSTALLATION OF QUICKTIME DID NOT COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY. iTUNES REQUIRES QUICKTIME...<br /><br />...not to mention with fragments of iTunes apparantly now lurking about my PC.<br /><br />Of course, as, evidently, this error is common knowledge to everyone on the planet [except me?] iTunes does has not squandered their time including a suggestion of what to do if \\"Quicktime\\" will not load.  What do I do now. Seek out a hacker?<br /><br />The several times I kept trying to re-install and re-install and re-install the software I just got to the point of clicking \\"FINISH\\" and the installation died right in front of me. [It's not exactly a glowing review for iTune's \\"Quicktime\\" when it is appearing more difficult to acquire than a virus...]<br /><br />As for now?<br /><br />With no Suggestions...<br /><br />No software...<br /><br />No MP3s...<br /><br />And a number of vinyl records ordered.<br /><br />Ion, the manufacturer of what appears to be superior hardware, should be ashamed of themselves for linking it to suchunstable, defective, bargain basement software, if one would risk insulting responsibly and professionally designed programs by calling this wheezing iTunes \\"Pong\\" era fraud, \\"software.\\" It was insulting enough to have my disk chewed up with meaningless options, and commercial promotions, not to mention a media player I did not need and did not want, and \\"Quicktime\\" to boot.<br /><br />But to have the iTunes software's INTENDED FUNCTION now gridlocked to a point of requiring the negotiation of e-mails or 1-800 numbers, or \\"The geek Squad\\" to get it working is an unforgiveable slap in the face. Why Ion would risk bad reviews by marketing what appears to be a perfectly sound piece of hardware, with defective, useless software makes no sense to me.<br /><br />[NOTE TO APPLE: If you want to declare war on Bill Gates, and punish PC owners wth the burden of Apple software, would you please not use my PC, OR my nerves, as your battle ground?]<br /><br />As the saying goes, the only reason I am giving this disaster one star is because I don't have the option of giving it NO STARS.<br /><br />[Are there any other Ion-iTunes victims here that can recommend REAL MP3 conversion software? Or does this mean another donation to The Good Will?]<br /><br />As for any future association I might entertain with any future Ion product, that, as they say, is the end of that.
B00756GKBA|3.0|Love Madonna, but this is not her best work.  Yes, it is a fun, upbeat, happy album which she excels at, but the music is too juvenile.  This would work if it was for someone like Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera or Katy Perry.  But Madonna?  No.  She's an incredible artist who gave us exceptional work like Ray of Light, Music, Confessions on a Dance Floor, or even all that stuff she did in the 80's. It's almost like she's pandering to young people.  Music listeners are smarter than that.  You can't deceive them.  They can see right through someone trying too hard.  It doesn't work and she should know that.  Madonna is an incredible artist and I love her work and messages, but I'm critiquing the music on this and its below average standards for someone of her caliber.  It's also beneath what someone like Madonna should be cranking out at this point.  Hard Candy was similar as well, almost like she's trying too hard.  There are some strong tracks on this like Love Spent and Masterpiece, but ironically those weren't released as singles.  What a surprise.  The singles released were juvenile pandering garbage pop tracks to stay on the charts.  They predictably barely charted.  I want the Madonna that doesn't care about impressing and is more interesting in expressing.  Still love Madonna, but not crazy about this album.  She's always surprising the music world and I'm sure she will produce some amazing work in the future, but this was not it.  It's....just okay.

1439152799|5.0|I'm a fan of Kate Morton's work so I was happy to settle down and read The Distant Hours. At 670 pages, it isn't a book you can whizz through, nor is it an easy read. But if you're looking for an intriguing read with more threads than a spider's web, then you should definitely check it out.<br /><br />This is the story of Milderhurst Castle. It begins with a long lost letter, which results in Edie Burchill taking a trip from London to Kent in search of the grand old castle, and the three Blythe sisters that live within it. Edie is linked to the castle because her mother lived there when she was evacuated during World War II - and it was from here that the mysterious letter came.<br /><br />Soon after her arrival in Milderhurst village, Edie finds herself fascinated by the story of the three sisters and the decaying castle. This fascination only increases when she starts to find out more about them and their lives - particularly the fact that none of them ever married, and that the two older sisters spent most of their lives looking after their younger sister, due to her taking a funny turn when her fianc&eacute; jilted her in 1941.<br /><br />Edie's own mother's past is wrapped up in the castle, and as she sets about unravelling it, she discovers that there are more secrets than she could have ever imagined hidden within the old stones. Stories of love, loss, family, friendship... and some much more sinister tales, too.<br /><br />Kate Morton has turned out another fabulous book here. With books this long, there's a danger that it won't hold the reader's interest, or that there's superfluous information. This is definitely not the case with The Distant Hours. It's telling the story of a castle and its inhabitants across the span of many, many years and several generations of family. There's a lot to tell and it's all relevant to the plot. I, for one, was drawn in very quickly to the narrative, and found myself, just as Edie was, to find out more and more about the happenings at Milderhurst Castle. Morton has an enviable knack of telling a story in such a way that she gives you titbits of information that make you desperate to find out the full story. This happens throughout, giving you lots to think and wonder about, not least how it will all tie together at the end of the novel. But tie together it does, with a satisfactory if not tragic ending.<br /><br />I really enjoyed The Distant Hours and think Kate Morton's imagination and style of storytelling is incredible. I'll be looking forward to more of her books.ngs at Milderhurst Castle.

014312093X|5.0|The book is not for the anxious or impatient.  Le Carre builds the plot and the characters slowly, but deeply.  This is one of those books that, if you follow it through, you'll look back &#34;My God!&#34; and want to read it again.  Le Carre seems to know that the intelligence business isn't defined by action sequences and a resolving plot twist - it's truly a complicated and political business, but hairy none the less.  Well worth the journey.  My advice would be to stop looking for James Bond and sit back and enjoy how masterful Le Carre is with the pen.  ...Wondering if the next 2 installments in the Karla trilogy are as good.

069111966X|5.0|I'll be concise.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />Everything, essentially. He goes into REALLY, REALLY, REALLY deep explanations of methods of problem solving, when to use what techniques, how to use them, and how they work. Sometimes, the explanations go on for pages so you forget what you were originally reading about - but that's good!<br />He also provides examples of his problem solving techniques and how to use them.<br /><br />What I love was that he repeatedly goes back to a big list of problem solving techniques he has in the beginning of the book. He keeps asking the questions necessary to solve an example problem, referring back to the list, so you get a hang of when to ask yourself what.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that it's old. It's not as easy to follow as a modern book. I don't get why things were written in this weird English compared to now, but it's not exactly a simple read. Give yourself time, read it more than once, really study it.

1612130283|4.0|These books are not something I would normally read, but I am so glad I did. There are a lot of haters out there protesting all sorts of things about these books. Aside from being repetitive, I found them engaging and hard to put down. They are not literature by any stretch, but they are sexy and entertaining. If this really was fan fiction initially, that is okay, too. Folks are taking this too seriously and not finding the entertainment value in the books. I think they are fun, engaging, and kind of hot. Enjoy.

0307959856|2.0|I understand the impulse to write in Jane Austen's voice, I really do. So far, no one has managed to do it successfully, and this book is no exception.<br /><br />The book starts out well; James' development of Elizabeth and Darcy's characters is faithful to Austen's, and draws the reader in to the details of their life together.  As the story progresses, however, James' voice drowns out Austen's.  The characters come to resemble the more generic ones on the margins of James' previous works, without the well-developed personae of her own detectives.  Finally, I found the resolution of the mystery unsatisfactory and contrived.<br /><br />As a fan of both Jane Austen and P. D. James, I had high hopes for this novel.  Both writers craft settings and develop characters that are individual and memorable.  I hope that James will stick to writing her own, inimitable characters, and resist the temptation to borrow other writers'.

Even if you never pick up a pencil to actually DO a caricature, after readying this book you should have absorbed enough sterling information that you COULD.  You \\"just\\" need to screw on your courage hat and try. Tom is a perfect example of a person who wanted to do something bad enough to keep on trying and never give up the dream in the face of a \\"no\\". And the best thing about him is that he is comfortable enough with his success to be magnanimous and share what he's learned along the way. I have read the book through cover to cover, TWICE, and feel good enough about what I have learned at Tom's \\"elbow\\" to practice it quietly in private, improving enough to finally make myself smile. A big crooked, gap-toothed smile. What, me worry?  Thanks, Tom!

I for one, think that Eddie Vedder's genuine personality and honest ability make him one of the very few who can. He comes out on the stage looking like the guy setting up to play on some street corner, but then he ends up touching and connecting to his audience in a profound way. Yeah, he's the guy from Pearl Jam, but on this stage he's even more of the real deal. Nothing comes across as flashy or pretentious. What he does is genuine and it's from the heart.

B000001ZS3|5.0|Over the years serious aficionados of electronic music have made Jarre the butt of endless jokes. His music, it's been said, is too polished, too clean and, ultimately, too clinical. As David Toop observes in Oceans of Sound, his marvelous book about the evolution of ambient music, Jarre typifies a kind of \\"old-fashioned hard sci-fi\\" approach to electronic music, reveling in its attributes of \\"coldness, detachment [and] mechanisation.\\" Toop's criticism is, at least partially, a valid one, to be sure. In evaluating Jarre's oeuvre, it's tempting to say of him what Cezanne is reputed to have said of Monet's technique as a painter: \\"Monet [was] just an eye--but, God, what an eye!\\" By analogy, one might say that Jarre's music is nothing more than delicious ear candy--but what ear candy! So much electronic music has emerged in the 35 years since Jarre's first album that it's easy to forget how fresh and daring (at least in a bourgeois sort of way) Oxygene really was back in 1976. Jarre's particular talent was his not inconsiderable ability to narrow the Wagnerian scope of Klaus Schulze's Gotterdammerung cosmic epics to bite-sized portions and add the impressionistic seasoning of Debussy and Ravel, thereby making space music far more palatable and accessible than it had ever been in the hands of its Teutonic masters. There's an irresistible siren-like quality to the six-part song cycle that makes up Oxygene: the recognition that it's all surface beauty and very little depth, yet an accompanying inability to break free of its overwhelming magnetic force. Jarre's mastery of his craft is almost brazenly displayed on the first half of the \\"Oxygene\\" suite. His command of orchestration, his innate gift for melodic invention and harmonic resolution, and his intimate knowledge of the synthesizer and its astounding sound-generating capabilities all testify to his particular genius at sound design. In summation, the album's breathy synthetic string arrangements, surging pneumatic-pump rhythm machines, stratospheric noise sweeps and breezy pop melodies construct a sophisticated aural doppelganger of an element to which we are all native and imbued.mp rhythm machines, stratospheric noise sweeps and breezy pop melodies construct a sophisticated aural doppelganger of an element to which we are all native and imbued.

B005A1ER0I|5.0|Ran across Two Steps from Hell about two years ago and really like their premiere album.. When I say I listened to each song hundreds of times I kid you not. Their album is amazing... Seeing as I loved it so much I instantly bought their second album, and really enjoyed that as well.<br /><br />Somehow I managed to miss the release of this album and only got it a few months ago. But let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing! I would venture to say that it is easily better than Two Steps from Hell's Afterlife album. It just has such a nice diverse range of songs and the quality never lets up...<br /><br />Very worth getting for those who like epic music (everyone should).
B0000074QN|5.0|Depending on whom you ask, Vangelis' symphonic electronic extravaganzas are either the stuff of legend or just plain stuffy. But, on whatever side of the fence you choose to stand when evaluating Vangelis' oeuvre, there's no denying his considerable ability to weld romantic lyricism and baroque structures into towering cathedrals of sound. Vangelis' fussy ornateness and technical self-assurance make Albedo 0.39 the Brandenburg of cosmic music, which is perhaps one of the reasons why so many of its tracks were selected as thematic accompaniment to Carl Sagan's visionary Cosmos series. The throbbing sequencer that introduces the album's overture \\"Pulstar\\" quickly recedes into the background behind a cascading waterfall of electric piano and Vangelis' signature brass synthesizer which is responsible for carrying the piece's main melodic line. The crashing orchestral percussion that punctuates the rococo arrangement heightens its intensity as it approaches symphonic overload. The stirring coda, almost anthemic in phrasing, illustrates Vangelis' total mastery of achieving flawless shifts in lyrical mood. \\"Alpha\\" follows essentially the same pattern and is undeniably the single most beautiful composition on the album. Its simple melody belies the sophistication of its almost architectonic arrangement, a graceful dance of staccato synth chimes and singing siren-like flourishes that builds to a thunderous climax. More experimental pieces like \\"Nucleogenesis\\" and \\"Main Sequence\\" are clearly indebted to European neo-classical avant-garde techniques in their use of compound time signatures, dissonant sound effects and weighty compositional themes. Their overall appeal is perhaps as program music for some sweeping space opera yet to be filmed. The title track uses a detached voice to relay astronomical data about the earth perceived as a celestial object. Swirling in the background, Vangelis' battery of synthesizers evokes a sense of mystery and awe at the staggering mathematics of the sky. As a whole, Albedo 0.39, as its title implies, is an expression of classical proportion, fixed ratios and symmetrical precision--the calculus to orchestrate the invisible harmony of the spheres.s of the sky.

B007JOM0GC|4.0|The Good:<br /><br />For those of us who never purchased the original release, then this cd will be a true treat. This is the first Katy Perry cd I have bought. With this Definitive 18 track collection, you are getting 7 additional tracks including remixes of \\"ET\\" and \\"Last Friday Night\\" along with an acoustic version of \\"the One that Got away.\\" Even better than that is the inclusion of three new songs. \\"Wide Awake\\" and \\"Dressin' Up\\" (these two could easily become future singles) along with her current seventh #1 track the powerful balled, \\"Part of Me.\\"<br /><br />This album will now enter Music history as having the most singles and number one tracks by any artist (Male or female) from a single album. It is almost like a Greatest hits compilation.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />I can understand die-hard fans being upset at now having to buy the album twice for really three new tracks. I too do not like record-companies gouging people with many different versions of the same cd.  If you already have Teenage Dream  then just download the three singles and add them to your Katy Perry collection.<br /><br />Maybe what the record executives should have done was include a bonus DVD with the 7 videos alongside this release to make this worth the full price.

I've read all of Kinsella's books and have found each one to be entertaining.  In this one the main character, Poppy, shines as a woman who finds a phone in the trash after hers is stolen and uses it as she tries to locate her missing engagement ring and in the meantime also learns a few things about herself and her fiance.  She also finds a friend in the man who owns the phone which predictably turns to romance but not until the very end.  The only thing I could have done without were the footnotes which didn't seem to add much to the experience and I found myself skipping over most of the time.  But that aside it was still a wonderful read!
0800141660|5.0|This movie was my first taste of Jane Austen.  I have to admit, when it first came out I was a kid, so I wrote it off as boring and didn't bother to watch.  In my teens I realized that I actually liked period drama's, and this movie quickly became a favorite of mine!<br /><br /> The movie itself, as a period drama is first class!  Although it isn't completely faithful to the book, it is my favorite of the adaptations I've seen ('07, and '81).  The casting is superb (although 2 of the actors were a bit older than their book counterparts); and their acting leaps & bounds better than the '81!  The scenery, and stately homes are stunning!!  Also, the soundtrack fits the period, and compliments the storyline very well.<br /><br /> Most likely, if the viewer hasn't read the book, the alterations, and missing characters shouldn't affect their opinion much.<br />_______<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />As for the (most notable) missing scenes/parts:<br /><br />  - Willoughby's visit, and conversation with Elinor at Cleveland (during Marianne's sickness).  The movie tried to rectify it by way of Col. Brandon.  After his revealing Willoughby's seduction of his ward to Elinor, he proceeds to tell her he inquired, and has reason to believe that Willoughby's intentions were not entirely as dishonorable toward Marianne.<br />..It's not quite as satisfying as hearing it come from Willoughby himself though.<br /><br />  - Edward's week stay, not long after they arrived (on his way back from visiting Lucy in Plymouth).  The book scene conveyed the troubled mind of Edward, and his internal conflicting feelings as regards Elinor, and Lucy.<br />And provided a hint of what was to come, with the lock of hair seen by all in his ring (which he passed off as Fanny's, and the Dashwood sisters supposed he somehow obtained a lock of Elinor's without her knowing).<br /><br />- The dinner party with Mrs. Ferrars & Jennings, the Dashwood's, Steels', and Middleton's.  Not a major loss there, being that Fanny made it clear at the beginning that their mother expected Edward to marry a woman of means and fortune, otherwise suffer being disinherited.<br />  And before revealing her engagement, Lucy told Elinor she finally met Mrs. Ferrars (after being invited to stay with the J. Dashwood's in London).<br />______<br /><br />  The missing characters:<br /><br />  I personally don't mind the fact that Lady Middleton (& children) were left out (the movie stated Sir John was a widower).<br /><br />In the book, Miss Austen describes her as \\"(though perfectly well bred,) she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place enquiry or remark\\".<br /> With that said, it wasn't that much of a loss to leave her out being that she and Mrs. (John) Dashwood were so much alike (\\"there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathized with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanour, and a general want of understanding\\").<br />In the book, all she really did was dote on her children, and play hostess.<br /><br />  They also left out the other Miss Steel, which wasn't a big deal either.  The movie showed Lucy spilling her secret to Fanny instead.expected Edward to marry a woman of means and fortune, otherwise suffer being disinherited.    And before revealing her engagement, Lucy told Elinor she finally met Mrs. Ferrars (after being invited to stay with the J.

In the book, Miss Austen describes her as \\"(though perfectly well bred,) she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place enquiry or remark\\".   With that said, it wasn't that much of a loss to leave her out being that she and Mrs. (John) Dashwood were so much alike (\\"there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathized with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanour, and a general want of understanding\\").  In the book, all she really did was dote on her children, and play hostess.      They also left out the other Miss Steel, which wasn't a big deal either.  The movie showed Lucy spilling her secret to Fanny instead.

B006ZZANFG|5.0|A friend from out of town showed the video and live performance of Loreena Mckinnet. I thoroughly enjoyed the video, Moorish scenery, weird instruments ( a hurdy gurdy?) used to make the music and the mesmerizing voice of McKinnet. I kept humming the tunes and decided to get a copy for my self after my friend returned home. One of the best purchases I have made this year.
B00756GKBA|3.0|Expectations were high for MDNA, Madonna's first studio album in four years, and after several spins, this uneven and derivative record has left me a little disappointed. The irony is that back in 1983-84 when radio and clubs were discovering \\"Madonna\\", our lady was making melodic dance music using sexy vocals and catchy hooks (\\"Everybody\\" and \\"Physical Attraction\\") unlike the robotic, mechanical club fare by faceless artists like Debbie Deb (\\"Lookout Weekend\\", \\"When I Hear Music\\"). Flash-forward nearly 30 years and Madonna's vocals sound as detached and over-processed as Britney Spears on about three-quarters of this album. It was fresh and exciting back in 2000 when \\"Music\\" was released (and \\"Music\\" was a smorgasbord of lovely melodies and introspective lyrics), but in 2012 I was expecting something more innovative from \\"the Queen\\".<br /><br />There is very little about this album that separates it from the current crop of successful pop-tarts like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. Even worse, is that while Madonna has always borrowed from others but managed to successfully put her own spin on things, there is just too much here that is derivative and now she's even resorted to stealing from herself. Perhaps reteaming with Orbit wasn't the best idea after all.<br /><br />Borrowing from past glories, the opening voice-over on \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" is captivating, although sounds all-too-similar to \\"Sorry\\" and the song itself, while energized and catchy, is too frantic like those 2-Unlimited hits of the early '90s. The production on \\"Superstar\\" is good, the song itself is a mishmash of earlier triumphs. It borrows a guitar line from \\"Ray of Light\\", contains a role call of silver-screen legends (\\"Vogue\\") and bits of the rhythm track are stolen from Madonna's own favorite '80s dance group Lime. Right from the first note, the melody of \\"Best Friend\\" is ripped from J-Lo's \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\".<br /><br />Pandering to the lowest common denominator we have innocuous, juvenile club music with lazy lyrics (\\"Turn Up The Radio\\", \\"Some Girls\\") that you'd expect from Miley Cyrus or Britney Spears. However, if you love Martin Solveig's brain-dead \\"Hello\\", you'll probably love these.<br /><br />Kanye West's appearance on \\"Hard Candy\\" was bad enough, but here things get even worse when Nicky Minaj and MIA show up. \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" is just terrible--seriously, an attempted remake of the 1980s ZZ Top rocker would have been a better idea than this. Sounding more like a theme from a teenybopper sitcom on Nickelodeon than a Madonna record, the rap is cringe-worthy and while it's obvious Madonna is trying to appeal to the youth market, she doesn't need these potty-mouthed \\"celebrity\\" rappers to sell a song. Strangely, I found the Party Rock Remix slightly more tolerable. \\"I Don't Give A\\" is an annoying, defiant rap diatribe dedicated to Guy Ritchie, no doubt.<br /><br />Although I was hoping for something more organic, by the time we get to \\"Masterpiece\\" and \\"Falling Free\\", it's a case of 'too-little-too-late' (besides \\"Masterpiece\\" tries too hard in its analogies). \\"Falling Free\\" is a stark, beautiful closer but just seems to be missing that certain something. The incredibly simple \\"B-Day Song\\" is a harmless, fun mid-'60s British Invasion ditty but only really stands out because of it's technical simplicity compared with everything that's come before it. Upon repeated listening it becomes as annoying as Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\".<br /><br />MNDA is not a total loss, however. \\"Beautiful Killer\\" plugs along pleasantly but the lyrics are not that great. \\"I F***** Up\\", repulsive title aside, could have been single material had Madonna been smart enough to realize this beforehand and replace the offensive with a more radio-friendly lyric. I'm on the fence about \\"Love Spent\\", which had potential to be an epic fast love song but tries to be too musically adventurous for its' own good, with too many vocal key changes. It's like a 'Confessions'-megamix of\\"Hung Up\\"/\\"Isaac\\"/\\"Let It Will Be\\".<br /><br />The two stand-outs on this album are the wonderfully dark, hypnotic club thumper \\"Gang Bang\\" with a techno buzz reminiscent of Darude's \\"Sandstorm\\". It's a simple yet effective revenge tale on which Madonna doesn't even sound like herself which makes it all the more interesting. More songs using the 'less-is-more' motto could have saved the album. \\"I'm Addicted\\" is a mix of swirling electronica that recalls \\"Impressive Instant\\" with lots of stutter edits and chants of the album title \\"M-D-N-A\\". \\"I'm a Sinner\\" is another of the few winners here, the fusion of great late-'60s sound and religious imagery is like \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" meets \\"Like a Prayer\\". The most infectious song of the album--perfection!<br /><br />Considering Madonna's age and experience and the fact that her primary fanbase is now in their 40s, I was hoping for something a little deeper--not necessarily Joni Mitchell but not Katy Perry or Lady Gaga either.<br /><br />The album would have been better had \\"Beautiful Killer\\" and \\"I F***** Up\\" replaced \\"I Don't Give A\\" and \\"Gimme All Your Luvin\\". Worthwhile for \\"Gang Bang\\" and \\"I'm a Sinner\\", but you have to endure the cringe-worthy \\"Gimme All Your Luvin\\"' and horrible appearances of the vulgar Nicki Minaj. Unfortunately the outstanding numbers and weak ones cancel each other out so that I can't give this more than THREE-and-a-HALF STARS. 75% of it will make a good mind-numbing workout album, though.\\"Hung Up\\"/\\"Isaac\\"/\\"Let It Will Be\\".<br /><br />The two stand-outs on this album are the wonderfully dark, hypnotic club thumper \\"Gang Bang\\" with a techno buzz reminiscent of Darude's \\"Sandstorm\\".

B006MGC3VK|3.0|While some may like it, I was disappointed. I prefer their heavier sound from previous work, this was pretty light airy stuff, except for the first two tracks which at least include some of Jim's crunchy guitar.  I was severely hooked on \\"Blood\\" for 9 weeks, then got their first album, which is just as awesome if not more.  Cheers y'all.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is an excellent game.  The graphics are well done, the story is interesting and the clues are fun and challenging.  I highly recommend it!
B005A1ER0I|2.0|Loved Invincible and I found this album as one that other people bought/liked after it.  But I am disappointed with it.  It has all of the parts to make a music epic, strong latin chants, women with soaring voices, rise and fall in pace, Eastern notes, but it ended up being cliche.  It's too much to have all of those aspects in the same song.  I latched onto Invincible right way and could feel the story each song was telling but Illusions just felt like the epic equivalent of a lifetime movie...cliche.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was extremely disappointed that I wasted my money on this book. With all the hype that's been going around, I was expecting something of a much higher quality.<br /><br />The main character, Ana, annoyed me to no end. She's a 21 year old \\"woman\\" whose favorite expressions include \\"crap\\" and \\"double crap,\\" she's completely inexperienced with men, has not experimented with alcohol, and she has the intellectual capacity of a flea. This doesn't sound like any 21 year-old to me! And to top that off, she's okay with doing something completely insane without much more than a bat of an eyelash all to get a boyfriend.<br /><br />This book does read like Twilight, but I did not enjoy it at all even though I am a Twilight fan myself. The plot seems to borrow heavily from the Twilight books, and while I do understand the author started out as a fanfic writer, this seems borderline plagiarism.<br /><br />Bottom line - don't waste your money or precious days of your life.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I really enjoy these talks. In a world where much of the information we are inundated with is negative, most of these talks give something positive, or at least educational.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I didn't see this show when it originally aired, but am thoroughly enjoying it now. Lee Majors is a legend.  Our grandsons  are loving it and they are ages 8 and 12.

B0077ATSSQ|3.0|\\"My father died at 9-11. After he died I wouldn't go into his room for a year because it was too hard and it made me want to cry.\\" Oskar (Horn) is having a hard time dealing with the loss of his father (Hanks). On the morning of September 11th he is sent home early from school and is the first one home. He listens to the answering machine messages that he hides from his mother (Bullock). One year later he finds a key in his father's closer and finds one more way to be close to his dad. Going in I was looking forward to this one. Tom Hanks usually doesn't make a bad movie. While this is in no way a bad movie it was much slower then I expected. This was as depressing as I thought but there was something missing to really drive it home. Much like \\"In The Land Of Blood & Honey\\" it seemed to try to hard to make you feel bad when just the story alone has the power to do that. The one huge bright spot is the acting by the kid playing Oskar, he is in about 95% of the scenes and carries the movie extremely well. For a kid that young to steal a movie from Hanks is very impressive. Overall, a very good movie but I was expecting it to be better. I give it a B.

B007JUWM64|1.0|As a cinema lover who yearns to escape into castles, costumes, and adventure, I've been waiting for a good ol' fashioned musketeer remake for quite a number of years... Unfortunately, I'm still waiting.  This is a comic book-like adaptation which is poorly casted, heavy on computer generated imagery, and without the slightest regard for realism, sophistication, or historical accuracy. (17th century zeppelin ships...really?!)  Even though it had a few admirable moments, words simply cannot express the pure lunacy and absurdity of this picture.  At no point will you feel like you're living in the time and place of the story, and isn't that what watching movies is all about?<br /><br />I would only recommend this film for youngsters with short attention spans or people who love not films, but video games.<br /><br />If you really want to see a musketeer film achieving greatness in every category (casting, costuming, direction, cinematography, etc.) there's no doubt you need to see Richard Lester's \\"Three Musketeers\\" and \\"Four Musketeers\\" filmed back-to-back in 1973.  They are highly regarded as the best musketeer films ever made.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|\\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not.\\" Ted (Efron) is just like any boy. Rides around on his bike trying to impress the love of his life Audrey (Swift). Her dream is to see a real live tree. The city they live in is made of plastic and air is sold in bottles. When Ted's grandma (White) tells him of a man called the Once-ler (Helms) he risks everything to go and talk to him. I have to admit the only reason I really watched this is because my daughter wanted to see it. I am actually glad she forced me to go because I really enjoyed it. There is enough adult stuff mixed in to make it enjoyable for everyone and not just kids. Danny DeVito being cast as the Lorax is genius and actually makes it funnier. I expected this to be a total \\"Save the world from humans\\" type movie but while the message was there it didn't seem preachy and was more funny then anything. If you are looking for a good family movie this is one of the best ones to come out in a while. Overall, much, much better then I expected and one of the best family movies in the last few years. I give it an A, my daughter gives in an A+.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just had to put my one star in the reviews so that other amazon customers won't make the mistake I did and think this is a good book. How does it have so many stars? I got so tired of reading the same description over and over of the male character and his long fingers and copper hair. How many times can Ana say \\"Oh MY\\". I will never look at Amazon customer ratings again when choosing a book. Be Warned.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|[Updated 1 DEC 2012]<br /><br />Normally I am not a romantic retrospective kind of guy, but this was a brilliantly done movie.<br /><br />The premise is that a young upper crust man wants to work in the movies.  He runs away from his noble home to \\"join the circus\\" and ends up camping out at Sir Laurence's movie offices where he literally camps out until work becomes available.<br /><br />He is eventually given some small tasks that he excels at and is rewarded by being made the \\"third director\\" (basically the go-fer for everyone on the set).<br /><br />Enter the big name Hollywood starlet, MarIlyn Monroe.<br /><br />Normally I would add a spoiler alert, but you already know the plot.<br /><br />Ms. Monroe is a difficult person to work with.  She has particular needs, and she gets what she wants.<br /><br />I was a little worried that these fits of pique would all be explained away with psychobabble, and some of Marilyn's poor behavior is.  Still Director Simon Curtis does a good job at giving Ms. Monroe some empathy without making her a like able character.<br /><br />Our upper crust runaway has his heart broken by his three day tryst with the married Marilyn, roll the credits.<br /><br />I want to highlight one incredible performance.  Judi Dench, M from James Bond, steals the show.  She plays the grand dame of British film, and she plays the part perfectly.  The nobility radiates from her character in a positive way that enhances the characters around her.<br /><br />This is a great film to cuddle up with and watch with some one special.<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich

0143117009|5.0|Look no further! Everyone who cares about the future of the world economy, and the prospects for our planet in general, should read this book. Though it discusses complex issues, it offers really enjoyable reading if that is what you're looking for. I once saw one passenger reading it on a plane, it was a long-distance flight, and I found the title very appealing (probably because I come from a country that did not have an easy life). Though it was nearly 4 years ago, I remembered the title and bought the book only now. I received a revised edition which gives an insight into what happened after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Enjoy and use the ideas!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I haven't come close to playing all of the games on here yet but I can already say that there's something for everyone.

The games can be tricky and my husband has it too so we compete to see who can get the highest score.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|The typical lifespan of a contemporary musician in terms of creative output seems to follow a very predictable trajectory. What is the peak creative period for most musicians? Eight years? Perhaps ten?<br />Then there is Maynard James Keenan. After nearly three decades of making music Maynard shows absolutely no signs of burning out.  He has somehow figured out how to remain relevant, vibrant and extraordinarily creative over a very long period of time . With Puscifer, particularly this album, MJK has once again caught lightning in a bottle. His curious, playful, mischievous, and sometimes dark introspection are all on display here. And what a display it is.The opening track, Tiny Monsters, is absolutely stunning. Horizons (and the story behind it) is both inspiring and tragic at the same time. There is not a bad song on the album. Conditions of my Parole is clearly the playground for all the things Maynard would never record with Tool or APC. The musicians are all remarkably talented and play off each other so well that they really have heard (or better yet seen live) to be thoroughly appreciated. Carina Round, a rising star in her own right, adds a dimension that Puscifer's earlier work lacked. She is without a doubt the final key to a very beautiful puzzle. I can not imagine the band without her.  Go to Youtube and watch Puscifer's live performance of \\"Telling Ghosts\\" on Jimmy Kimmel and you will understand exactly what I mean. This is my nominee for album of the year.  This is the album your friends ask you about when its playing in the background. This is Maynard still in his prime, all grown up and apparently having one hell of a good time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I most appreciate this book for the way in which it is written. The story is told in first person present tense, so the events in the plot feel very immediate. Also there are many intense exchanges between the characters and the violence and tensions between them feel very palpable. Katniss, the protagonist of the story, explains this dystopian world and her conflicts as she experiences them in a very raw yet expressive manner. It never feels overworked or contrived. I thinks this really speaks to the talent of the author, Suzanne Collins.<br />The premise of the story leads the reader to ponder many of the moral and philosophical implications embedded in the book. When we root for the victory and survival of our protagonist, are we also not rooting for the death of these other teenage characters? How much of the decadence and frivolity of the Capital culture can we relate to in our contemporary one? How much would we be willing to sacrifice for a sense of security?<br />In a couple of ways this book falls short. I had difficulty really relating to and empathizing with the characters. Many were memorable, but I just couldn't bring myself to emotionally invest in them. The contrived romance between Katniss and her fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, is made into an interesting plot twist,  but it is clear that this will clearly devolve into the overdone love triangle. Overall, it's worth your time, and at the very least, if this book isn't your cup of tea, you'll manage to read it quickly.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I enjoy period pieces and so when I purchased the first season of Downtown Abbey, I had expectations of finding a good story but was not prepared for the wonderful masterpiece that has been created by Julian Fellowes. The story is compelling, set in the first part of the 20th century. The characters are splendid, there's rumors, heartbrake, love, war, scandal and blackmail so far. I couldn't wait to see second 2 and it's left me yearning for more, can't wait for season 3 and I don't want it to stop for years to come. Just wonderful and if you enjoy real British drama, this series has it all.

He starts out his promo video implicating whole wheat and then shows pictures of heavily calorie/fat laden sources of refined carbs.  What's up with that?  We all know those are bad.  Insulin resistance is related to weight, exercise, family history, belly fat, etc. etc.  Give me the data to implicate whole wheat (or is it cookies and donuts, I'm confused).  Those w/out a scientific backround can be easily convinced by testimonials, the oldest trick in the book to sell product.  Think critically when reading this book!

B007LB1O3I|5.0|\\"MDNA\\" by Madonna is a phenomenal assembly of energetic and catchy beats.  She creatively dabbles in various genres and touches on happy themes of life through hits such as \\"Masterpiece.\\"  There is something for everyone on this cd and even Madonna fans are obviously going to differ on what they like most on \\"MDNA\\".  This is because songs such as \\"Turn Up The Radio,\\" \\"B-Day Song\\", \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\", and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" experiment with varied life themes. However, my two current favorites are \\"Superstar\\" and \\"I Don't Give A\\" (featuring  Nicki Minaj). \\"Superstar\\" appears to be a song about seeing what is brilliant in someone.  \\"I Don't Give A\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) appears to send a powerful message of self-confidently taking control of one's destiny.  \\"MDNA\\" by Madonna is great for Madonna fans and/or anyone who enjoys music collections that span the pop, dance, and electronica genres.

There are lots of fine middle grade and YA books that work because of interesting characters or creative world building or engaging plots. or whatever. But there really aren't that many YA books that feature fine literate writing. There are beautiful phrases, wonderful insights, startlingly sharp lines in this book. Actual, \\"hey, honey, let me read this to you\\" paragraphs.<br /><br />  So, putting aside the characters, the intricate plot, the scene setting - this could be your young reader's introduction to fine, polished, restrained, compelling WRITING!.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|I am on listen 3 now, and the disc has grown on me.  Being a fan of all of the bands that the component members came from or have a history with and can say that its definatelty \\"a little bit of this and a little bit of that\\".  What is interesting however the musicality of Portnoy's drumming.  I was expecting his usual hard full on style, but here he blens and becomes part of the over all blend.  There are a few songs that certainly take a turn in the the \\"Spock's Beard\\" land for those that are fans of that style. However if your looking for a \\"Dream Theater\\" sound you will be dissappointed.<br /><br />This is disc is Prog rock from start to finish.<br /><br />Its a really great disc...I am off for listen #4.

B006ZNRD06|3.0|I tried Meridian, Avia and a slew of others and this app seems to the only one that can play AVI videos. (Both play mp4's though). I guess it is pricy since it is the only one that works for AVI vids and they know that.<br /><br />Also, why the heck can't the Fire play AVI vids natively? Isn't AVI one of the most commonly used formats? And where is the Windows Media Player App for Android? I'd pay for that!<br /><br />Guess Amazon wants you to only buy from them and not transfer your own content. Maybe I should get an ipad instead. At least there I have options to buy AND import my own stuff. (Having Flash isn't all that necessary anyway).

B00005Q4CS|4.0|I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\" The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.<br /><br />\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary \\"tough love.\\" Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.<br /><br />The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).<br /><br />The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.<br /><br />GRADE: B-entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.<br /><br />GRADE: B-

B007MNV5WU|4.0|this game is a lot of fun!!! but it dosent have mighty eagle like it does on ipads and stuff. it also dosent have many levels, but they will come soon. the thing I really like about it is the gravity fields on the planets! they really make this game feel different than the original, unlike Rio and seasons which were the same but different backgrounds. and why cant you buy the 99<br />cent version?  the game it a lot of fun but why does amazon decide to leave out parts of it? please respond!
B00004WG2F|5.0|this movie was shipped and recieved on time.  I bought as a gift for someone else so i hope all is well with it.  I didnt watch befor gave it to them.

B005G4TJUC|5.0|First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From \\"Bad Boys\\" to \\"The Island\\",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and \\"Transformers 3\\" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was \\"Revenge of the Fallen\\",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I bought 3 Michael Buble CD's at the same time. And this album is OUTSTANDING. He does the best rendition of Me & Mrs. Jones that I have ever heard. I could listen to this album 24/7 and don't think I would ever get tired of it. His voice is so magical and beautiful. This album would get 100 stars from me, if that option were available. I also purchased one for a cousin and had it sent to her as a surprise, and she feels the same way I do about this album. Simply AWESOME.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|Like many die-hard fans of this band, the anticipation of a new release from The Mars Volta is one of the most exciting experiences. With each album, it becomes a sort of game to predict what type of twist and turns Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala will take. So, we arrive at Noctourniquet, the 6th LP from the El Paso band. What do we get? Well, we get an extremely accomplished album, and for this fan, a massive sigh of relief and renewed excitement. See, The Mars Volta's last LP, Octahedron, was advertised to be a massive stripping down of their sound. For me, while it is certainly a decent record, it turned out to be rather hollow. The band wanted to slow down the in-your-face abrasive attack that quite frankly, peaked on The Bedlam in Goliath, but they did not have the songs to back it up. This record definitely succeeds where Octahedron somewhat failed. Not only does it have good songs, it has EXCELLENT songs. You also get a smorgasboard of past influences of the band, giving perhaps the most even album since Deloused in The Comatorium. Melody abounds everywhere, songs like Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound and In Absentia are major breakthroughs for this band, while songs like Aegis and Imago convey true heartbreaking emotion, something I haven't heard from this band in a long time. Restraint is the name of the game on this one, so if you need freak-out time signatures, constant key changes and the like, you may be disappointed. This album however does have the trademark quirkiness of the band and is certainly still a \\"progressive\\" album, songs like The Whip Hand and Dyslexicon will definitely bludgeon you with trademark Volta prog aggression. However, everything is condensed and somewhat user-friendly. I don't see this record havinng a major pop breakthrough, but the cohesion, flow and songwriting of this album is top notch. So, if you're a fan of the band, but perhaps thought their self-indulgence killed them for a while, try this one out.  Great, inventive stuff.
B004ZG5EYC|1.0|I've updated my firmware and software, but still this blu-ray won't play.  All my other blu-rays play fine.<br /><br />It's a shame because I was really hoping to appreciate the beautiful cinematography in high quality.  I got it on sale for $9, so it's not worth my time to return.  Very disappointed, though.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This free book belongs in everybody's library. I am impressed with the ease of using a Kindle for reading books. I also thank Amazon for making classics available to everyone.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|Maiden is the best band that ever existed! Let there be no doubt. There will never be another band like this. The artists and their music is legendary. So of course I pre-ordered this sucker, and saw it over the weekend.<br /><br />I love the fact that they release a lot of live dvds and albums these days, 'cause like it or not they're not getting younger. And it's great that the fans get to build a large archive we can enjoy long after the boys have retired. I would rather have seen them release more studio-albums with new music though, but as long as something is happening in the Maiden camp I'm happy.<br /><br />The documentary:<br />I think it's an awesome documentary, and makes you realize just how much work they put into their tours. It's quite insane, actually! I had no clue that the crew put SO much work into it!<br /><br />The concert:<br />As a die-hard Maiden fan who has seen everything they ever released hundreds of times, I think this is very good but maybe not the best. Waaay better than \\"Dance on the road\\" and \\"Live at Donington '92\\", but not as good as \\"Flight 666\\", \\"Beast over Hammersmith\\" and \\"Rock In Rio\\".<br /><br />It captures exactly what you get when you go to a modern Maiden show. I personally like the split-screen editing, 'cause it gives you even more the feeling of confusion you get at a real concert, where you constantly change focus between the backdrops, the effects and the people on stage.<br /><br />I personally think that the new songs are most interesting to see/hear. The ones that have never been played before. They sound exactly like they do on the album, and work even better live. The classics from the 80's... it's not the band's fault they are getting older, but the actual band doesn't really look as good/cool now as they did back in the days (except Steve Harris). And that kind of makes me wanna skip the classics on this one, and watch the \\"Live After Death\\" video instead. But the classics need to be there, basically because that's what the average Maiden-fan wants, so I won't complaint about it.<br /><br />The performance:<br />I might be over-critical, but I feel they are getting a little sloppy again. Like they were when they released \\"A Real Live/Dead One\\". I think it lacks the focus and perfection they had on \\"Rock in Rio\\" and \\"Beast over Hammersmith\\", which almost have studio quality playing. The guitars on this are just a wall of sound, and you basically don't hear what the guitars are playing, except on the solos. And I think the solos are a little sloppy too. It honestly sounds really messy at times. I did, for example, not recognize \\"2 minutes to midnight\\" until the riff had been played a couple of times. And this is a song that I've heard billions of times.<br /><br />The sound:<br />I have to admit that I'm getting a little tired of them using the same sound/production on everything they release. In the 80's, they changed their sound between every tour, but now it's getting pretty predictable. And that makes it even more tempting to skip songs like \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"Iron Maiden\\", and \\"Fear of the dark\\". Because you've heard it all before. More or less.<br /><br />They need to be there and they are perfect songs on an actual concert, 'cause then you sing along and just enjoy yourself, but it's REALLY boring to see at home. Unless you're a new fan, of course.<br /><br />All in all, another excellent release that gives us 5 new songs (The Final Frontier, El Dorado, The Talisman, Coming Home and When The Wild Wind Blows) and a cool new documentary. Keep 'em coming!
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63...I lived through it and the images of that fateful 72 hour stretch from noon Friday until after 6 on Sunday in the bottom of the Dallas Police Station are indelibly etched into my mind. At well over 8oo pp, the book is hefty but I ordered it before it became available on the Kindle. It took me a week to read and in retrospect is is a week that was filled with my own time travel into a world  Mr. King created and deliciously so. While I have not read many of his books, I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one I have. The pacing was excellent. The imagery was finely tuned and the outcome while perhaps a bit forseeable was satisfying nonetheless. I wonder what would happen if one of these time traveling people that he writes about would knock on his door in the middle of the night and would show him the errors of his ways.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It was a gallant effort that succeeds on almost every level. But the highlight for me was the ending. And if you haven't read it, you must experience it. If he only took all of those hundreds of pages to reach it, it was well worth the ride.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. King. Misson Accomplished.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. I was hesitant at first but it wasn't long until I was swept up in all of Christian's fifty shades. I just finished and plan to start reading it over. I didn't want it to end!!!
B007G5K066|2.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br />How I wanted to enjoy this movie. I love the character of George Smiley. Reviewers are disparaging the portrayal by Gary Oldman, but this alone is not what keeps this movie from succeeding. In my opinion, the screenwriting team of O'Connor and Straughan intentionally abandoned the slow, methodical style of the Carr&eacute; spy novel; instead attempting to recreate a \\"Mission Impossible-thriller\\" atmosphere. Unfortunately for the viewers, this doesn't work with the story. As a stage director myself, I often choose to have my shows play in updated, or simply different settings, but I never change the crux and core of the storyline as they have. For example, the character of Peter Guillam was not a homosexual in the book, Prideaux was---which is why he exacts revenge on Hayden. Control wasn't a decrepite alcoholic, he simply had a heart condition. Connie was a devoted and long-time analyst with the circus, who liked her drink, not a potty-mouthed wench. The serial-adulteress Ann Smiley is almost completely ignored, save for a really bad scene with Firth fumbling to get his shoes back on his feet. The Christmas party is still baffling me. Not only was there nothing of the sort in the book, it made absolutely no sense in the picture. It certainly didn't move the action forward.<br />I accept the fact that screenwriters face the challenge of taking, in this case, a very long and drawn-out story and condensing it into a 2 hour film. Not every book lends itself to screen adaptations. This book certainly does not. I recommend the BBC miniseries with Sir Alec Guiness [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]. This is a fantastic six-hour presentation that faithfully recreates the novel. Naturally, I recommend reading the book. In fact, read the entire Karla trilogy [[ASIN:0517146975 John Le Carr&eacute; : Three Complete Novels ( Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy / The Honourable Schoolboy / Smiley's People )]]. Spy novels at their best.
B000SOYEQY|5.0|I don't think I will ever tire of this movie.  The re-digitization of this film was outstanding.  A great value for the money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app every day, usually multiple times. It works great as a morning wake-up alarm with snooze and features for those of us who have a harder time waking up. The scheduling is helpful for people with variable wake-up times. It has a nice, flexible nap timer that can also work for cooking timing or anything else that needs an ad hoc alarm. Highly recommended.
B0064BWDRW|2.0|It had to come. This latest novel by Nesbo has missed the mark and I found myself skipping pages just to get through to the end. I'm not sure what Nesbo had in mind with this novel - apart from killing off dear old Harry - but whatever it was he failed to get the message across. I have been a Nesbo fan for years now and have devoured all his novels but will be wary in future. Nesbo has become a bit like Gerald Seymour in his writing, tired and lacking a decent plot.  A great pity.
0061564893|1.0|The color plates are nice, but the writing is completely amateurish.  I kept waiting for evidence, but found little more than endless, irrelevant, tedious verbiage, mere inferences based on speculation, with promises of future \\"tests\\" to be made. This isn't proof, or even close.  It's way too long, digressive, and INSUFFERABLY BORING!<br /><br />Embarrassing, too.  I pitied Menzies when he wrote of being wined and dined by the Chinese Communist hierarchy. He had no concept of being used by the skilled politicians of Beijing and China's academia. I could imagine the Chinese, taking in his silly theories via translator, thinking of how they could string him along and puff up their ancestors' \\"accomplishments\\" for propaganda.  All the while Menzies is so very, very happy.  The word I'd use is \\"naive.\\"  Unless, of course, none of this happened and \\"Gavin Menzies\\" is a fake, a ghost writer hired by the publisher, with a \\"Navy\\" background invented for plausibility?<br /><br />Let's assume he exists.  In the end I mentally labeled Menzies as the 21st century's equivalent of Ignatius Donnelly, who enthusiastically made up his own imaginative Atlantis to sell a book to the gullible of the 19th century. Both come across as self-deluded.  At least Donnelly could write well and was self-educated in many areas of the limited knowledge known in his century. If most of Donnelly's footnotes were from long-disproven theorists and cultists, at least he took the trouble to add them. I kept my high school copy of ATLANTIS: THE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD  It's filed with other cult books like Velikovsky's WORLDS IN COLLISION, but every few years I reread it for a nostalgic giggle. I treasure it in a way, since discovering the errors in Velikovsky's batty astronomy and Donnelly's ATLANTIS fakery taught me to become a skeptic at the early age of 15. At 76 I don't need to waste my time on Menzies' dottiness.<br /><br />No one is disputing the probability that Chinese ships were, now and then, blown off course and touched down across the ocean, and even traded as far as Africa. As for the maps, why not use the standard theory: that Columbus and the others bought them from booksellers who got them through a chain that led back to seagoing Arabs and European fishermen?  Deliberate voyages from China may have been made further south in Africa, but to the East Coast of America?  These claims are exaggerated beyond belief. Proof is lacking. Menzies' theories are like those in all cult books--extravagant, invented and without support.  He puts text inside quotation marks--without bothering to add footnotes so we can see whether it's outdated, made up, or from someone's Email.  Other telltale signs of cultishness are lack of knowledge and failure to use simple logic.  Menzies makes many of these glitches, repeating the old howlers about \\"white\\" Native Americans (speaking Chinese this time, not Welsh or Norse).  He drags in the colonial-built Newport Tower where I used to sit before going into church across the street. This and most of his purported \\"facts\\" require massive revision of agreed-upon history. An example of lacking logic would be his repeated phrase, \\"Maoris and Polynesians.\\"  That's like saying \\"Italians and Europeans\\" or \\"sparrows and birds\\", as if one were not a subset of the other.  Maoris ARE Polynesians in language, culture, history, and every other way. Doesn't every old sailor know that?<br /><br />Fortunately I got this book for 50 cents at a book sale. But I should have looked inside, then I'd have realized that Willam Morrow is now part of the Harper-Collins publishing monopoly. Morrow, a formerly reputable publisher, is now owned by Rupert Murdoch, the tabloidist of FOX News.  Need I say more?n off course and touched down across the ocean, and even traded as far as Africa.

0525478817|3.0|I have been a fan of Green's novels since I read Looking for Alaska when I was 19, and had just graduated from high school the year before. Then I read An Abundance of Katherines (my favorite novel of his) and have since watched his videos and read every book he has written, including short stories and collaborations with other authors. Of course I was excited for this book and preordered a copy so I could finally have a book signed by him. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I feel like the older I get (I am now 25), the less I can believe Green's writing. I used to love the dialogue in his books but it has progressively gotten more and more obscure and less realistic. I understand style, I am educated and have of course taken many lit classes when I was in college, but he took a few too many liberties in this novel. I just couldn't believe in much of any of the conversations between Hazel and Augustus, I really didn't like the smoking as a metaphor. There were just too many things that were unrealistic. It is unfortunate because I wanted to love this book for so many reasons: my own health battles with my thyroid, my experience in high school when I lived in the Netherlands and traveled many times to Amsterdamm with my friends...there were so many things that I should have been able to relate to, but unfortunately I could not.

Illustrations are well worth the price, if nothing else.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are very few books that I've read more than once. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one (I think the count is up to 7 on that one), and now The Hunger Games is another. The first time I read this book, it was love at first word. I was utterly blown away by the world that Suzanne Collins created. It is seriously such a unique take on the whole \\"the future looks pretty bleak\\" theme. It's savage and terrible softened by a teenage love story that instantly transports me back to 1999 and I become a giddy girl rooting for Gale...no, wait Peeta...no, wait Gale.<br /><br />Though it gets pretty cheesy at parts, I had to remind myself that this book was meant for a much younger audience than myself. Once you get past that and into the real meat of the story, it's truly unbelievable. Still one of the best book concepts I've ever come across.
B000002I27|5.0|The debut by the DOORS is one of the finest and greatest moments in music of all time...So, it´s  simply impossible to match this masterpiece?

8186336141|5.0|This book is a treasure of information about pranayama, mudra, and bandha. Any serious student or teacher will appreciate the rich detail presented about these subjects. It is as if you are getting the information directly from the source. If you are new to yoga be careful using the section on asana, as this part could use some updating to reflect modifications and suggestions for staying safe in postures. With that being said this is another great book from the folks in Bihar, India.

Details of he eruption from the perspective of a water engineer (an aquarius) I thought was an interesting perspective. I learned quite a bit about aquaduct construction and just life in general in this time-frame. The plot was interesting enough to keep me turning pages, and while the love story was kind of a side note, I liked it too. An Indiana Jones engineer!

B00337QJO8|5.0|This CD was everything I was expecting.  It was a used copy so the case was a little worn but the cd itself played well, no scratches.  It was perfect.  I enjoyed the Hal 9000 collage.  The extra track of the distorted \\"Adventures\\" that was not used in the film was a little strange but interesting.  I will probably not listen to that one much.  All of this music is strange but I've seen the movie so many times, I'm used to it and it sort of grows on you.  Abstract music is never very pleasant the first time you hear it although these pieces seemed to fit well with the images in the movie. I really like the ethereral sound of Lux Aeterna. It fits well with the moonscape footage.  Atmospheres has that feeling of moving faster than light.  The Requiem just sounds alien.  I've always loved the Gayane Ballet Suite.  It sounds so lonely and expansive, like a person walking through a totally deserted city. Of course, the Blue Danube is just perfect for the waltz of the spaceships. And what can I say about Zarathustra?  Inspired.  The music is a huge part of the ambience of this movie and it's hard to imagine what it would've been like without it or with different works.
B007ORU2BY|4.0|It clear that Mad Men have become the Sorpranos of the 21st century, and we had to wait almost as long for their return too. As with anything with this  series do not take anything on face value.There is more there than you might realize. The stage has been set, the players have return, and its the turbulent Sixties. Drama will unfold. Plus we have not even seen Betty Draper yet. Another thing Alison Brie. I just snapped who she is. I love her on Community and totally forgot she was part of this cast. Seeing her back on this show should be fun as Pete is becoming the dark horse of agency.

Unfortunately, Mr. Murakami doesn't seem to believe in reality...or in fiction.<br /><br />The little people, the two moons, an immaculate conception, and a romance that runs 900 pages before the lovers meet are just samplings of the 'non-real' elements in 1Q84. Fortunately, Murakami, a dazzling writer, gives us an endless (really....endless) supply of intriguing literary devices to keep us entertained. Our heroine reads In Search of Lost Time, paralleling our own reading experience. Should her never finishing it give us a hint of what we might do with 1Q84? Other parallels and layer upon layer of character/reader shared experiences help to keep us awake and some are fascinating. Many are simply repetitious.<br /><br />Murakami tells a story, but doesn't treat it as anything approaching a representation of reality. I understand that this is common in his other works. The two conceptions of reality in 1Q84 are both incomplete, cloudy, and false. This seems to be intentional...I love difficult books. I love David Mitchell, Lionel Shriver, Tom McCarthy, Jennifer Egan and other writers who challenge the shape and purpose of the novel. 1Q84 challenges the relationship between the writer and his reader and keeps his effort engaging, if not fulfilling.<br /><br />And the length.  Please, a novella would do, Haruki. This book is so long and develops so slowly it makes Proust's masterpiece (see above) read like the latest Jack Reacher novel.  To paraphrase the classic Alice Playten commercial, \\"I can't believe I read the whole thing.\\" And while much of 1Q84 is delicious, much is like certain Asian foods that leave you hungry no matter how much you eat.<br /><br />Good news, though. Lionel Shriver just published her new novel. Yeah! I need to cleanse my palette.new novel. Yeah! I need to cleanse my palette.

0439023521|5.0|Warning: spoilers ahead.<br /><br />The future society of the Hunger Games is in part a cruel boot in the face dictatorship with similarities to Orwell's 1984. The weather-manipulated, media-stage environment of the arena of the games has a similar feel to the Truman Show.<br /><br />Arguably too, many deeper themes and parallels could be read into the novel. The flowering of Rue's body after her death could be related to the flowering of the cross - an Easter Sunday tradition in many churches, symbolizing new resurrected life coming out of Christ's death and resurrection. Or it could be seen as a good coming out of the unjust evil of the games.<br /><br />Katniss has a desire to avoid bringing children into the world, where they could be subjected to the injustice of the games. This parallels Eve's desire at one point in Paradise Lost to want to avoid having children with Adam, because of the fallen world they would now be brought into.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is not without a bump in the road or two. Some parts could have been rewritten or omitted, such as the attack of the mutant gamers. All told though, the novel is well plotted and imagined. The love, loss, loneliness, and anxiety conveyed in the story is something readers of all ages can relate to. The novel is appealing to a wide readership for a reason.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I'm a long fan of the Muppets and this one really brought them back to life. For a very long time I believed that Kermit should have died with Jim Henson, but I can honestly say that that would simply have been compounding the tragedy of his death. Kermit was Kermit again, and my children loved him as much I did when I was a kid.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on Good Morning America.  They didn't really divulge what it was about, but said that it was HOT, HOT, HOT!  I am not a romance, erotic style book type, so for me to purchase this book was far reaching... but I did.  I am glad that I did.<br /><br />Christian is very domineering and wants this in ALL aspects of his life, including the bedroom (or playroom as he prefers).  Ana is naive in many ways, including the world of sex.  Their meeting is by chance and from there begins the story of Christian's pursuit of dominance of Ana in his playroom.  Ana just wants love... true love and she thinks that it is Christian.<br /><br />I don't think that this book would be appealing to everyone, but it definitely was an interesting read for me.  I love their love story and the changes that occur within Christian as he learns what love truly is.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|Unlike all who are stating they are HUGE  fans, I am not a fan of Mumbles but I did by this Album and after listening to it I come to find that it blows chunks!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is the second in a trilogy.  We are introduced to Christian and Ana, apart in the beginning, but soon brought back together.<br /><br />Christian is learning about love.  Learning about Ana.  And learning how to be a partner and not a domineering master.  Ana is learning about love.  Learning about Christian and his troubled past.  Learning to deal with Christian and his demands.  The two of them are inseparable and it is such a great love story.<br /><br />I love the way that Ana is working on the difficulties that Christian has and is slowly breaking down the barriers that he has created.  I enjoyed reading about Christian, as he learns to let Ana in and not shut her down.  I also enjoyed the story of Mrs. Robinson and how Christian realizes her true colors.<br /><br />Very quick read and it leads us to a point in their lives that is just blissful!
B0074EIQQU|4.0|This album does not sound as aggressive and complex as most of their previous works, though it does sound very melodic and has a lot of variety. Some fans may be turned off by this album at first, but after a few listens will come to enjoy it. Overall, the material is the most like Deloused than the other albums, but with some of their newer aspects thrown in. There are a lot of synths on this album which for some reason they decided to leave up loud in the mix. The overall mix is not as punchy and is more flat with a lot of reverb. I think much of this is due to Deantoni Parks drum style, which is very different from Thomas Pridgen's, but still sounds amazing and goes along well with these songs.<br /><br />To review each track:<br /><br />1) THE WHIP HAND - I have been listening to this song for over a year since they started playing it live. This song had a lot of potential and I had a preconceived notion of what the studio version would sound like; however they decided to make this song into an Industrial Rock version which sounds a lot like the band \\"Orgy\\". It does sound pretty awesome after a few listens when turned up loud. It would have been better if this version was a hidden remix track.<br /><br />2) AEGIS - This is another song that they had been playing in concert. I like this song, but is feels like the track placement that they decided on is all wrong. The placement of this song should have been switched with \\"Molochwalker\\". Aegis seems like it takes too long to get to the point and on the first few listens I became impatient.<br /><br />3)DYSLEXICON - Easily the most aggressive song on the album. This song sounds like it was pulled right out of \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" with a hint of Deantoni Parks drum style. This is where the album really starts to take off. The vocal melody in the bridge sounds like something off of Deloused in the Commetorium.<br /><br />4)EMPTY VESSELS MAKE THE LOUDEST SOUND - Another great song. This is probably one of their best ballads of all time. The drums on this one are very unconventional, even for a Volta album, but the fact that Deantoni decided to play the drums this way make it that much better.Very melodic, the structure is really good, and they didn't overdue this one by making it too long or adding minutes of noise to it.<br /><br />5)THE MALKIN JEWEL - I really like this song, but I don't know why they decided to use this one as the single. I think that this song makes for a great in between song but does not stand as well on its own.<br /><br />6)LAPACHKA - This song is just crap. I cannot force myself to listen to it all of the way through. The vocals are annoying, the synths are more annoying, and the quality of this song does not sound as good as the rest of the album. It sounds like they forgot to mix and master the song and then threw it in with the rest. I forget that there are 13 songs on this album and think there are 12..<br /><br />7) IN ABSENTIA - This song took me a few listens, but it is really good,It sounds like something right off of Omar's \\"Un Escorpión Perfumado\\" though I really wish that the vocals and drums didn't have that much delay on them and the song didn't sound this cluttered in the versus. I would love to hear this song recorded cleaner, played just the way it is, but with clean vocals and with the bass guitar turned up.<br /><br />8) IMAGO - really good slower tempo song. The drums sound programmed but I am pretty sure they are not. A lot of synths too, but they actually sound good with this song.<br /><br />9)MOLOCHWALKER - Classic sounding Volta song. I really wish that they placed this song on track 2 and Aegis on track 9. There is a lot of energy in this song and it would have carried well. Some weird synths in parts which are too loud in the mix and sound out of place.<br /><br />10) TRINKETS PALE OF MOON - really good slow song. Stripped down sound. Very melodic. Sounds like it could fit on anyone of their previous album until the drum machine comes in toward the middle.<br /><br />11)VEDAMALADY- Same as Trinkets, really good slow song. Stripped down sound. Very melodic, but then this song becomes kind of a dance song and sounds like something from the band \\"MUSE\\" or even \\"30 Seconds to Mars\\"<br /><br />12)NOCTOURNIQUET - One of my favorite songs on the album. Vocals are very melodic and emotional; the drums go from kind of a reggae beet in the verse to a spastic avant garde jazz beat in the choruses. The guitars have kind of an 80s Bowie sound which work really well. There is an arpeggiated synth played threw out the song which at first I thought ruined it, but now I don't even notice it.<br /><br />13)ZED AND TWO NAUGHTS - Another classic Volta sounding song with a lot of energy. Also sounds like something off of Deloused. A good ending for the album. I kind of listened to this one too much before the album came out and I cannot get into it anymore.<br /><br />This isn't the aggressive, complex, powerful Volta album that we are used to. I would say that it is more colorful. This album is to the Mars Volta what \\"IF NOT NOW WHEN?\\" was to Incubus.

B006P0FICE|4.0|I rented [[ASIN:B006P0FICE The Three Musketeers (Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]] from my local rental store this past weekend. Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good despite all the negative review. I was actually really interested to watch this in the theaters a few months back.<br /><br />This movie is pretty much like The A-Team (lots of \\"thoughtful planning\\"), Mission Impossible, The Matrix (slow motion action) and some Assassins Creed (Da Vinci's projects and technology) put together.<br /><br />This movie was entertainingly funny and great for the family and kids, nothing to worry about with \\"adult content\\"; just a few kissing scenes nothing more. You won't see any guts flying out from the swordplay/gun fights in this movie. If you're looking for action and [few] laughs then this movie would be the one to watch. I also liked how the storyline was unpredictably unfolded all the way to the end so all my guesses aren't always correct.<br /><br />My only complaint was that I was left confused on who is the antagonist(s) of this movie in the end and some (or maybe half of the) scene transitions were too subtle/confusing like things were left out. I guess I'll found out later if there is a sequel to this movie. :]<br /><br />Other than that, this is a pretty good movie and my mom actually wanted me to buy this movie now a week after we watched it. I actually preferred this movie more than Immortals, in my opinion.<br /><br />And another side note, I thought Aramis was played by Orlando Bloom this whole time... but he actually played the Duke of Buckingham (Luke Evans played Aramis) and I never noticed (a quick search online with their faces side by side is like 95% alike). Also, this movie didn't have to be 100% accurate because it's not a documentary.. some people might not mind that it isn't (like myself) and some people would mind that it doesn't add up right.

0385523912|5.0|An incredibly interesting book that takes the reader through several decades of North Korean history.  Following the stories of several individuals and families, there are portions of heart-warming and heart-breaking at the same time.  The factual tone allowed me to establish my own opinions on the happenings in a very secretive society.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is great entertainment.  Michelle Williams is excellent as Monroe but for me one of the best things about the movie was the who's who roster of English actors, Brannagh as Olivier, Judi Dench is also present, as it Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh (I believe she's French but she's appeared in many English productions and some American ones).  Michael Kitchen who is best known for the series \\"Foyle's War\\" is wonderful as is Zoe Wanamaker one of my all time favorite character actors, you'll recognize her from many, many BBC productions, in \\"Marilyn\\" she plays Paula Strasberg, Marilyn's acting coach and unofficial therapist.  Emma Watson who gained fame playing Hermione in the \\"Harry Potter\\" films also appears as Colin's would be girlfriend.  Eddie Redmayne is Colin Clark the young man who's diary the film was based on.  Redmayne is a face I didn't recognize but he's the epitome of a wide eyed, enthusiastic, fresh faced young man, the perfect foil for Marilyn's antics.  There was one scene when they return to Colin's alma mater, Eton, and as the two of them descend a staircase into a crowd of assorted Etonian students, teachers, cooks, and janitors, Marilyn turns to Colin and whispers in her vapory voice, \\"Shall I be her?\\"  With that she sways her hips, purses her lips and poses seductively for her audience.  Michelle Williams transforms herself into Marilyn.  She captures Marilyn's vulnerability, her mood changes, her drug and alcohol use as well as her dream of being recognized as a great actress.  There was a scene from the film they're supposedly filming \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" where Marilyn is all by herself in a scene, she's humming and prancing around, both the dance and the song performed sotto voce, that was magic.  Michelle Williams disappears almost completely in these scenes, her personality is wiped clean and all you see is Monroe.  This is a film well worth your time.
0385535139|4.0|I have never been disappointed with a John Grisham book and while I may not rank this the best, its certainly worth reading.  I really enjoyed this book.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I purchased an HDTV and Blu-Ray player specifically so I could watch the Blu-Ray version of this movie.  I loved the theatrical version on DVD, but I loved the extended cut version on Blu-Ray even more.  The extended cut answers some questions I had about the theatrical version.  For instance, how did the shot Baby Doll fired over her stepfather's head strike her sister?  As Senor Zoidbergo explained in his excellent review, Baby Doll fired a second shot that grazed her stepfather's arm, presumably passed through her sister, and then struck a steam pipe.  Baby Doll flashes back to the steam pipe being struck in her final moments of clear thought.  This movie has incredible graphics and action sequences, very likable characters, and an awesome soundtrack.  One of my all-time favorites.
0670022950|3.0|I have not read Steven Pinker's latest book, and probably will not do so, because I went to hear him speak about it; his 60 minute talk convinced me of his underlying thesis, that - contrary to ones's intuitive reaction - the level of human violence has declined throughout human history - whether you look at it over the centuries, the last 100 years (yes, even including the \\"awful\\" 20th century), or even the last two decades. I am satisfied that Pinker has done the research that supports his thesis, and I do not need to see all the statistics that the book contains. Having read many other of Pinker's books, I have no doubt that it is argued engagingly and authoritatively.<br /><br />What was far less satisfactory, from my point of view, was his answer to the question  \\"Why ?\\" He posits  four or five changing societal and cultural factors that have contributed over time to this secular decine in violence. What is disapointing - but probably not surprising - is his failure to include among these reasons changes in human nature itself. Quite the contrary, he explicitly dismisses it; his point of view is that, notwithstanding the continuing tendency to violence inherent in human nature, we have been increasingly deterred from expressing these in violent action because of such trends as the organisation of society into states and the expanding circle of mutually beneficial cooperation to which violence is inimical.<br /><br />Pinker's reason for dismissing the possible effect of a change in human nature, was that the violent tendencies in human nature still exist.  It is not hard to see why he departs here from an empirical argument to an a priori position.  If a contributing factor to the decline in violence was an evolution of human nature to be less prone to violence, then this would imply one of two things: either, that every human being is less prone to violence than their ancestors were, or that there are now more humans with a lower tendency toward violence than there were in the past. However the violence that does still occur in our time  - less widespread than in the past, but still as nasty as ever - clearly demonstrates that the first of these possibilities is not the case; if there has been an evolution of human nature toward lesser violence, it has not occurred at an even rate throughout all of humanity. This would leave Pinker in the uncomfortable position of acknowledging that human evolution is an ongoing phenomenon, and that evolutionary pressures act differentially on different human subpopulations. This is actually not a controvertial point of view; there are a number of instances where, because the evolutionary pressures were different, subpopulations have evolved differently. To mention just one such case; the gene present only in African populations, which if inherited just from one parent gives immunity to malaria, but if from both parents causes sickle-cell anemia. What Pinker cannot acknowledge is that there may well have been such differential evolution that has affected the human genotype above the level of the neck. He has gone on record as saying \\" People, including me, would rather believe (my italics) that significant human biological evolution stopped between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, before the races diverged, which would ensure that racial and ethnic groups are biologically equivalent.\\" (New Scientist, 11 March 2006). In other words, it is the fear of the accusation of racism that prevents Pinker - and he is not alone - from presenting an intellectually honest - or complete - argument.<br /><br />It ironic that, back in the 1980's when E.O Wilson first proposed the idea that human nature was a product of evolution just as surely as were other features of human biology, it was the political correctness of the time that caused him to be reviled both by fellow evolutionists and by other defenders of the conventional theory of human nature as  \\"a blank slate\\" on which societal norms are imprinted- a theory which Pinker himself has dismissed in a book of that name. Wilson's \\"biological determinism\\", as it was termed, fell foul of the fond liberal belief that everyone could be trained - or retrained - to avoid certain undesirable behavioral traits. Today, sociobiology - now known as evolutionary psychology, of which Steven Pinker is one of the most prolific and articulate exponents - is very much part of the mainstream of evolutionary thinking. But recent evolution is only \\"allowed\\" for finches and lesser mammals; for humans it has to have stopped  in the era of adaptive evolution, two million years ago. Presumably, when the flood of evidence of more recent human evolution - including that of human nature - becomes unstoppable, evolutionary scientists will embrace this idea too. They will take comfort from the knowledge that - contrary to popular use of the term - a more evolved state of an organism is not automatically \\"better\\"; it is merely an adaptation to a particular set of environmental conditions. Hopefully it will be someone like Pinker himself who will realize that positive thinking is about describing things as they are, not as they ought to be.- a theory which Pinker himself has dismissed in a book of that name.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|One can look at the average of reviews here to see that one either loves or hates this book, fewer falling in between. I am one of those in between. The first half of the book interested and angered me all at once. I could not put myself into Ana's shoes until somewhere in the middle. That being said, this book takes me out of my reading comfort zone, much in the same way Ana sees it. She does not want to oppose something because she is unfamiliar. This is why I am giving book two a chance. I want to see how the characters develop. The sum might be greater than the parts for this one. Only time will tell.

030788743X|5.0|So, our buddy Wade, is living in a pretty grim reality in 2044. The world has devolved to the extreme have's and have-not's (guess which one Wade is...) and almost everyone has retreated to a Utopian virtual world of their own design, OASIS. Wade is an OASIS fanatic and when the gazillionaire creator of OASIS dies and leaves his fortune up for grabs to anyone smart enough to get it, Wade is an unlikely but strong contender.<br /><br />Wade has to avoid death and destruction (literally and virtually) in his attempt to find every clue and solve the puzzle before anyone else. The Easter eggs and puzzles are all retro (from the 1980's) and are fun to read and solve along with Wade for anyone who might remember (and love) War Games, John Hughes, and old school video games.<br /><br />The stakes are high as an evil corporation is hell bent on solving the mystery before our beleaguered hero. Ready Player One is somewhat of a cross between Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Tron and Second Life with Eagle Eye thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The pace is brisk and at several points, the pages were turning so fast I thought I was going to get carpal tunnel. I could easily see Ready Player One becoming a great adventure/suspense movie. And guess what? It is! ...in 2014. Great, rollicking thrill ride through our past, present and future. I can't wait to see what Ernest Cline comes up with next!

0385534639|5.0|So, Celia and Marco are raised from childhood to be magicians. Not in the pulling-a-rabbit-out-of-a-hat magician (or illusionist), but the real-magic-shooting-from-the-fingers type. Due to their fathers' Machiavellian ways, they are also pitted against each other from childhood in a long, high-stakes contest to see who is the better magician.<br /><br />The arena for their years-long duel is the magical Night Circus. A curious, beautiful thing that suddenly appears and is only open at night. Morgenstern is such an artist with the written word that is could feel myself becoming more and more immersed in their beautiful, magical world with every turn of the page.<br /><br />Celia and Marco fall for each other eventually and now the race is on to discover a way out of their desperate duel. The characters are well-written, the fathers are cringe-inducingly evil and the supporting characters could be novels in their own right.<br /><br />With The Night Circus, Morgenstern has created a beautiful, ethereal, fragile and lovely world, inhabited with amazing characters that will linger with you for days.

0439023491|4.0|Anyone who was drawn in by Suzanne Collins' first book in the Hunger Games trilogy will enjoy the continuing battle between Katniss and the Capitol in this second installment of the series.<br /><br />All of your favorite characters are back and Katniss, who thought her life as a victor in the Hunger Games would be a more simple one, was very mistaken. Unrest from Katniss' defiance during the games which kept both her and Peeta alive has lit a fire (so to speak) of rebellion with the people from the districts.<br /><br />As Katniss and Peeta set off on a Victor's tour of each district, it becomes apparent that everything they say and do is construed as either a plug for the capitol or a rebellious action against the capitol.<br /><br />As the quarter quell reaping looms, a significant twist in the plot is presented and the reader is once again enveloped in the struggles for survival that made the original Hunger Games book such a page-turning read.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. I read it in about 8 hours. It was an easy read (about as easy a Twilight, sadly, but still more substance than THAT crap), and I find myself with more questions than I do satisfaction at finishing a decent book. This book well like a Cliff Notes book. Just honing in on key points of a MUCH larger picture than what is depicted. This saddened me. As the concept is wonderful! But I feel that having a prequel, and a long one at that, was in order.<br /><br />To enjoy this book you REALLY have to take it at face value, an easy read. If you think about the plot devices and the conflict and the motives of the characters too much you get very disappointed VERY fast.<br /><br />In the end, I give it a 4. ONLY because I was looking for an easy read. But I still find myself wishing for the length and the development I found in [[ASIN:0061862312 Wicked]] and [[ASIN:0618574948 The Lord of the Rings]]. There are MANY points to improve on (from character development, to the politics of the nation), but I'm still glad I read this.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|In spite of all the hype and Hollywood success, this is not a book for pre-teens. I recommend that all parents pre-read this trilogy before allowing a younger teen to read it. I personally find nothing entertaining, edifying, enjoyable, or enlightening in a book that glorifies cruelty and torture, in which adults sacrifice children to save themselves, fear and distrust are the prevailing emotions, and parents are weak and unable to care for their children, and the kick-ass heroine's best friend ultimately orchestrates the death of her sister and mother.<br />I wouldn't have like this trilogy as an adult book, as \\"young adult\\" fiction it's appalling.

This is not my main mixing board nor should it be anyone's unless you are a hobbyist just looking to have fun (that's cool too!).  The EQ's are decent, but I wouldn't really count on them for a main EQ or anything - it's just nice to have them there.<br /><br />My only complain with this mixer is that there is no power switch!  You have to unplug the board for it to turn off which is more of a pain that you I imagined.  Also, the light on this board is extremely bright.  Much brighter than any other light I have on any of my various instruments/electronics.  All this being said, for 50 bucks it does the job well.<br /><br />4/5

B0039PPW60|5.0|I use this board as a part of my daily gaming spot, let me tell you, it is excellent! The USB support is a little iffy, and from what I can tell defaults to the 3/4 sliders, I've gotten around this by sending my computer audio out in through one of the main channels using a RCA-1/4\\" adapter. The on board effects are stellar, but seem to all center around echos, so be ready on the software side! Some reviews I have seen for this board talk about excessive white noise in their recordings, The way I've solved this is using the 'Solo' feature for the channels I wish to use. The sliders all feel tight and responsive, my only complaint are the gain knobs, as they are slightly too tight, and you can easily miss the amount of gain you are aiming for. Overall, This is an excellent board, and I think it has gotten a bad rep due to early production issues.
0439023513|3.0|I was a late comer to the Hunger Games series, having just picked up the first book when all the hype over the movie started. I devoured the first two books, enjoying being emersed in a series.<br />  Then I began Mockingjay. I understand what Collins was trying to say. I understand she was trying to portray the cost of<br />war, the devastation of war, the impact it has on every one involved. That this kind of impact lasts a lifetime. However, I feel like so much was sacrificed to push this message in the readers face. The characters that I became so attached to in the first books, just become so flat in this book. So much of what made the first two books amazing was absent in this book.<br />  The love triangle is reduced to, honestly I don't really know what. The resolution is treated, literally, as an after thought. I get it. She was trying to show that nothing really matters when you are dealing with war. After everything Katniss had been through, the love triangle just didn't matter anymore. She had been stripped of so much, that she was never going to be same. But I just do not agree with that message. I really think that the love that Katniss had for both Peeta and was more important because of everything they were going through. While there is a happy ending (kinda) for Katniss, is just feels contrived and insincere.<br />  The death of her sister is done in such a matter of fact way. Katniss is already drugged and catontic that there really is not the impact you would expect. It just seems that Collins could have gotten her message across, with so much more emotion, then what she did in this novel.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I normally don't read crime/law novels but once I started reading this, I had to know what was going to happen. I thought the writing was phenomenal and the story was so well done. I told my best friend the whole plot because I couldn't stand not to talk to someone about it and even though I spoiled everything for her, she still can't wait to read it.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I rarely write reviews but just had to say I LOVE Leonard Cohen's \\"Old Ideas\\".  In fact, I'm afraid I'm going to wear out the CD!  I have most of his music and love them all but, like the late Johnny Cash, he gets better with age.  His voice is deeper and more gravelly.  His lyrics are those that only Cohen can produce.  The same wonderful backup singers are in place.  In short, this one is absolutely perfect!  So get yourself a good cup of coffee or a glass of wine, kick back and enjoy Leonard Cohen's \\"Old Ideas\\".<br /><br />My only criticism of the CD is that it's too short!

0446547654|5.0|OMG I laughed, I fell in love, I cried, this book was AMAZING!!!! I wouldn't be surprised if this was made into a movie as well. Dawson is the most amazing male character ever, I at first couldn't understand why he lived his life the way he did, until we met Amanda. Amanda the 'perfect' town girl who was feeling lonely in the crowd and found her perfect home with Dawson, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks. At first I was intrigued by the story, then I was captivated, Dawson's upbringing his determination to never be like the Coles and his need to prove to himself at least that he would never go back there.<br /><br />I read this book in one day that's how awesome it is. Mr. Sparks writes eloquently about love, whether lost, unrequainted, love in all it's glory, it's messiness and the even the ugly side of love.  I read this book and I became lost within the story, I was rooting for Amanda & Dawson, I wanted Dawson to get something beautiful in his life, something worth living for, and in the end he did.<br /><br />Amanda however, I both loved and hated her for her courage and her cowardice, as her mother told her, her decisions made the consequences of this book, if she made different choices years ago then the last few pages of the book would haven't been that way. But it wouldn't have been such a touching heartrending story. I raced to read the end of the book because I really needed to know was this going to be a happy ending, a messy ending, or what? When I got there I cried buckets because this ending wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />I'm in love with this book, and I will be adding this to the collection. This is a definite 5 star, burn rubber to add to your collection.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Like the others who have given this trilogy a 3 star rating, I loved the first two books but was seriously disappointed in the last one. She obviously wanted to hurry up and get it over with. (spoiler alert) So many good characters that I grew to love in the second book were killed for no reason in the third. It's like she just didn't want to have to write more about them so she got rid of them in the easiest way she could think of. It's really too bad. There was a lot of promise in what it could have been, but her heart wasn't in it, so it naturally failed as a result for me. I would give the first book a 4 and the second one a 4.5. But the last book's gruesome and depressing end ruined my love for the whole trilogy, putting them at a 3 for me.
B004EPZ03O|1.0|I think the next installment penned by Jason Segel  should be the virtues of the collective, and praise for a muppet \\"Dear Leader\\"<br /><br />No seriously, the villain of the movie should have been the FCC for destroying childrens programing.  I'm glad I grew up when you could enjoy Saturday programing like a kid should, relatively devoid of educational value.  If Laugh Olympics had a polictical point of view it was lost on me.  Or Pinelope Pit Stop had a feminist agenda (it might have, I was just a kid) I didn't know it.<br /><br />Of course the fact I don't enjoy musicals like I did when I was a kid could be another of the reasons I didn't get past the first 23 minutes. The lyrics and choreography where terrible.<br /><br />(Queue maniacal laughter)  Mwhaa hahahaha.

B004MC8CA2|2.0|This is basic. No parsing of Greek or Hebrew. No interlinear. No lectionaries. No scholarly lexicons. Commentaries are all the free and thus the weak ones that just give opinions without good research.

B005KXU83G|5.0|I was happy to add this remaster to my Kindle Fire.<br />I am a life long fan of his music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'll admit that I picked this up with high expectations after hearing about it from many of my friends. But within the first few pages, I had to put it down and decide if I really wanted to finish or not. Why? Because it was written in the present tense.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm a bit of a writing snob. I'm not afraid to depart from familiar genres or themes, but there are some stylistic points that I'm almost dead-set against. In particular, present tense and second person narration. I understand that present tense can lend a sense of the immediate to writing and I respect that. But it feels awkward to me (and, based on some reading I've done on the subject, to many others).<br /><br />That being said, I decided to finish the first two chapters and reevaluate at that point. I'm glad that I did because I found everything else about the book to be utterly captivating. The characterizations were strong. The plot was solid. It was written for a young adult audience, but the adults weren't written as morons. There was just the right amount of sweetness and humor to add poignancy.<br /><br />Yes, the concept of children killing each other at the whim of cruel overlords is horrible, but even ignoring the fact that it's fiction, I feel that it's leading up to more in the second and third books. The book isn't condoning violence, but rather (to use a cliche) holding a mirror up to reality and showing a slightly distorted reflection of how things are. The \\"Careers\\" are effective, but they're shown to be little more than animals in all of the important ways. The Tributes who I felt something for didn't glory in the killing. They were sacrifices and fought for survival. It's not a nice thing, but it's an important thing.<br /><br />Anyway, philosophy aside, I would definitely recommend this book to others. The tense might have kept me from becoming as enthralled as I would have liked, but I definitely think it is a worthwhile read. And it's nice to see authors treating youngadults as serious readers by confronting them with hard topics that they really need to think about.
0385751532|4.0|This book shocked me to no end.<br /><br />When I first started reading it, I was honestly getting a little annoyed at the childlike quality of it. And the deeper I got into it, the more I was expecting - but to a certain extent, I was getting nothing.<br /><br />Eventually, it dawned on me that this childlike style of writing only added to the shock and despair of the story, making it seem like John Boyne purposely used that tone in order to shock his readers. The innocence that comes with that tone, to read the thoughts of a nine-year-old, and go on this journey with him where you arrive at a fence. A fence unlike any other, where Bruno meets his only friend at \\"Out-With\\" - Shmuel, who was essentially the boy in the striped pyjamas. His naivete and simplicity lasted to the very end, where he holds his friend's hand and thinks how grateful he is to be with him. That moment killed me. How pure the mind of a child is.<br /><br />It was very easy to grasp what the story was about a few pages into it. A 'Holocaust' tale told in a completely different and unique way (with the exception of the Book Thief of course).<br /><br />I can guarantee that every person who reads this book will leave it with a feeling of shock and confusion. I don't want to give anything away, or go much more into the story, as it is quite short and to the point.<br /><br />But I definitely recommend this book, as it gives a completely fresh perspective of a story told, heard, and taught time and again. And as Independent says, this is a story that \\"stays just ahead of its readers before delivering its killer punch in the final pages.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not the normal genre I would read, but I asked a friend what all the hype was about.  She told me a little about the book and I thought I would give it a try.  I couldn't put it down.  I just bought the 2nd book for my kindle and can't wait to dive into it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid Romance reader and I did hear all the buff about this book and so I read all 3 and feel that it is one of the BEST escape from reality books I have ever read! Could not put them down and I feel you love to hate both the main characters!!! Please step out of the BOX and go on a true vacation ride!!!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I don't normally read fiction, let alone teen-fiction, but I made a trade with my wife to read it if she would read one of my books. I enjoyed the book and read in less than 2 days. I'm also not American so take the comments on America with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />The book sketched a post apocalyptic future of America after another massive civil war, and a communist style peasant uprising that was brutally crushed by the ruling powers. In part the story was a retelling of Ancient Rome's story with America as the new Roman Empire. Kinda hard to miss that with characters like Flavius, Octavius, and Caesar. The hunger games themselves are the Colosseum, with the live TV audience watching and hoping for blood. Certain parts of the games were mandatory to watch but perhaps the society had become so passe towards killing that it was just considered good TV?<br />There are so many political comments in the book that take stabs at current American politics. The poor education they receive in district 12 - read bad American public schools. And the anthem that continually plays and the law being read out? Star spangled banner and pledge of allegiance anyone? The huge divide between rich and poor districts - read Beverly hills vs Harlem or a small town in the heartland. There is also the huge emphasis on reality TV, media and cameras everywhere filming the entire thing. I don't like reality TV shows but is this where they will end up in the future after we're bored with the Kardashians?<br /><br />The novel was also hugely influence by two seminal works: Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave new world\\". In fact the society of 12 districts is kept in check by both prevailing metaphors. The Capitol and the richer districts are kept in check by their narcissism, entertainment and riches. They are so preoccupied with looking better, celebrities and the spotlight that they fail to see the horror of the games. People are killing others on live TV! I guess you give them what they want and they quickly sacrifice their freedom. Even those closest to Katniss in the Capitol (i.e. Cinna) hold their tongues and speak codedly when she wins. The lower and poorer districts are kept in check by force and coercion. I was impressed by the kind of subject matter the author tried to deliver to a teenage audience.<br /><br />But I have some reservations. Firstly the story if written in the present tense, which I found odd. It read like a screenplay with directions for actors as opposed to a real story, which would normally be in the past tense. It made it hard to get a sense of the time that had passed. Secondly, I think the book played right into the current teenage culture of suspicion, revenge, and anti-authority. And without offering it any sort of critique or alternative vision. The hero is overly suspicious of love, even when it stares her in the face. I understand how she came to be that way, but the author didn't hold out much hope for her changing. She is skeptical of marriage, and blatantly against bringing children into the world. Although scarred from a bad past, I felt it didn't fit with her character. The heroes are also dead set on showing the authorities that they are not under their control. That they are their own people, the captains of their own destinies. What teen isn't? But killing yourself to show them up? Come on. The author condones their actions as heroic, if they take our lives they can't take our freedom? There is no sense to their sacrifice, no hope that it will bring down the system. It's just ill-thought out teenage angst. Should all teens do this to stick it to the man? I'd rather see Teens stand up and say I'm going to fight to defend my right to freedom, rather than kill themselves to make a statement. Suicide is cowardly.<br /><br />With that in mind I gave the book 2 stars. It's OK, nothing ground-shaking, and would make a decent movie. I just hope teens are smart enough not to uncritically swallow the philosophy behindthe book.the book.

1577314808|5.0|funny that I am writing this review because I had this book a while and i read it but I was reading it with my ego. Ekhart should win something like a noble peace prize or something because this book is life changing. I dont even know where to begin so I can tell you personally what I have been doing. When he speaks off the ego, he means it comes in many diferent shapes and form. It can be a ego of pain, anger, desire, basically anything. basically the ego something you have developed your sense of self around. and it can get really worse if you keep feeding it. By meditating and prayer for an answer I found the root cause of my problem and birth of my ego and I relize I been feeding for 22 years. I dont really want to get into much detail about it because It really is indescrible. I been praticing to disolve the pain body, which can become bigger the more you feed it(ego) making it harder to disolve it. Sometimes I slip back into the pain from the past, but i am soooo much more close to Essense, GOD or spirit just by now knowing.<br /><br />So I defently reccomend this book
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is amazing the ads are fine for the people that don't like the ads and uninstall the game you should reinstall it
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I felt the book had the right amont of intrigue to keep me rolling along. I think the characters could have developed a little more, but we must remember, no one knew who they were or where they are from,this would be the reason for the second book, a little more character development tied in with the story. This book is targeted to a younger population, people who may not be as interested in the characters developing, the background and story development. These younger people and others just want a good story that has good action. No one knows what the maze is, no one remembers who they are or where they came from, but (minor spoiler) when the boys who get caught by the grieves go though the changing, their memories offered me enough of a glimpse into the future to continue my interest into reading the next book in the series. The book accomplished the main goal; lead him in with just enough information to keep me interested. I don't finish books if I do to like them, no matter what page I am on.  I did think the end was tied up a little faster then I could have thought to have done, but these things happen. I would definitely recommend this book for people seeking something along the lines of the Hunger Games. Sure it's not as violent, developed as the fore mentioned book, but I feel the series has great potential.

0684865130|5.0|The reviews are interesting, because no two people see 'Catch-22' in the same way. There are those who don't get it, of course, as there always are with any ground-breaking book, particularly one as unconventional as this. However, even those who like it don't always like the same things. Many people fall into what I regard as a trap, trying to pigeonhole it. It's a war book, a comedy, a satire.... yes, it is, but it's also many other things. The genius of 'Catch-22' is that it defies categorisation.<br /><br />Almost any kind of human interaction you can think of, with the possible exception of sport which only gets a minor mention, 'Catch-22' takes on. Capitalism, communism, religion, sex, courage, loss, medicine, discrimination, authority, man's inhumanity to, well, just about anything really; they all get a good working over. The form of the book is bewildering, with multiple storylines weaved together in non-chronological sequence. It's best not to try and sort them out, but to let yourself be tossed and turned in the sea of images Heller creates. Gradually, as the book winds towards its conclusion, the incidents and people sort themselves out; the final section contains despair and hope in about equal measures.<br /><br />The more you read the book, the more you realize how much of it is relevant to everyday life. Some of you might remember reading Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' for the first time and noticing that it's full of what are now cliches. They weren't cliches when Shakespeare wrote the play, of course, they were brilliant examples of phraseology which passed into the language after Shakespeare coined them. So it is with 'Catch-22', which identifies truths that we all know but just couldn't put into words before Heller did it for us.<br /><br />'Catch-22' isn't a comfortable book. It will make you squirm, unless you are so blind to human frailty that you fail to identify with the travails of the characters. The fact that at the same time as you are feeling their pain you are laughing at them only makes it more disconcerting. Ultimately, though, it will perform the service of all great literature- it will make you think.

B007K3JFUQ|3.0|In the first film made in 2009, Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes used his brain and brawn. Now in the sequel \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\" he is seen using only the latter. What was once a refreshing take on the well-known fictional character now becomes a kind of superhero trying to save the world from the archvillain. The second Holmes movies is a more action-packed, if derivative, sequel, for better or worse.<br /><br />In \\"A Game of Shadows\\" Holmes and newly-wed Watson must confront Professor James Moriarty, the mastermind of crime. Unfortunately, the writers team Michele Mulroney Kieran Mulroney, it seems, could not come up with a better idea than throwing references to the source material - several character names like Colonel Sebastian Moran (yes, from \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\") and lines from the book (\\"Come at once if convenient; if inconvenient come all the same\\") - into a typical storyline for Hollywood action movies.<br /><br />Had the story been more interesting, this could be still OK. Or had Professor Moriarty been more charismatic than the one played here by Jared Harris, all these things might be excused. As it is, the thin plot devoid of creativity and imagination hardly deserves the name of Moriarty.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace plays a fortune teller Simza, who may hold a key to Moriarty's latest grand criminal plan. Even the talented player, whose electrifying performance gave life to the character of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" cannot save the one-dimensional heroine from becoming a stereotype.  Stephen Fry's portrayal as Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes serves only as comic relief, which I think is a misguided idea.<br /><br />After all, this is a movie directed by Guy Ritchie, whose style has not changed much since \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" - lots of stylized visuals in action scenes, often with smoking guns and flying bullets. \\"A Game of Shadows\\" has a lot of actionscenes, together with Holmes as a martial artist predicting the opponents' next moves, frequently shot in slow motion. Now I start to think it is too much this time.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|I have enjoyed a lot of Iron Maiden live releases, and this one didn't dissapointed me. It has songs from all Maiden eras. I like the fact that they included the classics we all love and songs from BNW, DOD and TFF.

B007JCP8FE|3.0|Disappointing.  9 tracks in I was growing frustrated over hearing the same rehashed sound over and over, and frankly I was bored. The sound was stale, and each track sounded the same as the one before it -- generic and uninspired.<br /><br />I would have given the album only 1 star.<br /><br />But then comes track 10 -- \\"For My Sake.\\" It's amazing. That's followed with \\"My Name\\" -- another great song (though it doesn't compare to FMS).  And then the album ends solidly with \\"Through the Ghost.\\"<br /><br />I don't know why they buried the album's three best songs at the end, and frankly I'm kinda pissed at Shinedown for making me suffer through nine painfully boring tracks -- and almost making me give up on the album -- before I could hear them.  I'm glad to know Shinedown is still capable of producing great music; but I'm disappointed that they can't do it more consistently.
0887307280|2.0|First things first: this book in nothing more than an extended promotional pamphlet for Gerber's consulting firm.  You are even given friendly reminders of the company's name and URL between nearly every chapter!<br /><br />The presumptively narrative, poorly formated, offensively styled prose could be summaraized in 1/10th the space.  Gerber is convinced that small businesses cannot be both successful and sustainable.  He flat-out asserts that the only path forward from initial success requires rapid growth towards a franchise operation and a fully hands-off approach to actual customers.  The prognostication: turn your restaurant into McD's and your cafe into Starbucks or perish.  For a consulting fee, his company will be happy to tell you how to do just this!<br /><br />The book barely earns a half a star for being such a shining sample of customer-ignorant, grow-or-bust corporate groupthink that it opens up a world of thought exercises about why the modern market is flooded with such low-quality, poorly-serviced, consistent crap.  Case studies abound within on how to destroy any sense of humanity in business and replace it with a semi-conscious (ab)use of human psychology to make money in an unsustainable way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a ride! Both romantic and erotic. Was sucked in from the first page and bought all three one right after another.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have found this app easy to use and reliable.  It is convenient to use while I travel .  I can read my daily study both on my Kindle Fire and my smart phone.  I would like to see a &quot;search&quot; option though.  All in all, I would highly recommend this app to everyone!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The Lorax is based on the Dr. Suess book. As the mom of 14 and grandmother of 7, I have read this story many, many times. The movie is visually stunning, the colours are wonderful and the characters are well done, although a bit different than the originals. I enjoyed the music and the added dialogue was funny.<br /><br />I took my youngest 5 children, ages 9 to 13, and they enjoyed it as well but it certainly wasn't one of their favourites and there were times my attention wondered from the movie.<br /><br />It's worth seeing, but might be okay to wait and see the DVD.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app!  Tells me everything I want to know and also gives severe weather alerts.  Really like the map because it shows the counties.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter is a man suffering from grief and loss who gets transported to Mars. Once there, he finds battles, love, meaning, and by the end, he once again has a life worth living.<br /><br />I saw the movie with my 5 youngest kids, ages 9 to 13, and we all enjoyed it. We saw it in an IMAX version - perfect setting for the great special effects. The plot is rather thin and basic, but this is an Edgar Rice Burroughs story and that's how he wrote his adventures. I didn't mind the lack of plot, the inconsistencies, or even some of the editing mistakes, because I went to have a fun time and I got that. If you want meaning and depth, this movie isn't for you, but if you just want to enjoy a night out with your kids, this will do it.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I thought confessions was sicking...the whole album was amazing. BUT MDNA IS POP AT ITS BEST!  no one can denied she's The Queen Of Pop for a reason...MDNA is that reason. Deluxe Versions has more music WORTH getting it.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I've been a Springsteen fan for 30+ years now, and I consider most of his stuff to be of pretty high quality. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is no exception - good writing, good playing, good singing (none of his affected \\"drawl\\", which I always found a bit forced), and the production is good, as is the sound. Most of the songs are top-notch, even the much maligned \\"Rocky Ground\\", in which the short rap actually seems to add to the song, at least in my opinion (and I'm certainly no fan of rap). To my ears, the only weak link here is \\"Jack Of All Trades\\", which is simply just not up to par, lyrically or musically. Overall, though, another strong addition to Bruce's catalog.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game but it crashed after a week so I have to start over. but I'm doing it better this time. I wont spend real money so it takes more time to reach some goals.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|When the stereo and mono box sets came out on 9/9/09 I listened to both sets over and over and over again for several months and concluded that the mono box set has the best overall sound.<br />A few months ago I purchased this catalog on usb and listened to it over and over and over again in both FLAC and mp3. Then I went back and spent more time with the original box sets from 2009.<br /><br />When all was done my ears told me that this usb set on 24 bit FLAC blows everything else out of the water. The mp3 set was right up there with the stereo cd set. FLAC is in a league all by itself. If you're playing it in the background at home you wont notice any difference. If you're paying close attention it will knock your socks off. The only downside is finding a way to play FLAC.  (24 bit FLAC is not user friendly at this time.) But the time will come in the not so distant future when it will be easy to get it played and the wait will have been  well worth it.  Hopefully, some people with knowledge about electronics reading this can offer up insight as to when playing FLAC will be routine for us all. Any advice about 24bit players would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Being that this set is out of print/production with no indication of more to come I would recommend buying it because the price has nowhere to go but up. We were lied to when told that the mono box set would be very limited, but it appears we were told the truth about this set being limited. And if they ever did decide to flood the market in the future this will still be a rarity that will hold value.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is just great! it allows you to download any youtube and watch it even when not in Internet connections. you can also download just media making it so you can use music off of youtube and turn it into a song you your divice!
142314189X|5.0|The entire Percy Jackson series is educational, phenomenal, side-splittingly hilarious, and so much fun.<br /><br />If you want your child (or yourself) to learn about Greek Mythology, this is an excellent place to start. It's always more fun, and easier, to learn while reading a great book. And these are GREAT books.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a demi-god, the son of Poseidon. He and his friends go on action-packed and hysterical journeys to save a planet that usually has no idea it's in mortal danger.<br /><br />I'm not one to give away a 5 star rating to just any old book. I literally read all 5 books back to back.<br />I got no sleep. That's how good these are.<br /><br />I was upset to find that the series was over after book 5 and still want more. (I have not yet read his next series, The Heroes of Olympus, which are said to include both Percy and his friends), but I WILL. Soon.<br /><br />You can bet on that.
0312641893|5.0|This is a wonderful debut YA novel by Marissa Meyer that captured me right from the start. She was able to add science fiction and magical elements to a classical fairy tale that many of us grew up with.<br /><br />Loosely based on the Cinderella fairy tale, the novel introduces us to Cinder as she's looking for a foot to replace the one that she's outgrown. As a cyborg, she is made up of many inhuman parts. Her leg, her arms. Even her central nervous system has been modified.<br /><br />I really admire the author's way of making her main character so different from other teenagers of this futuristic world. Not only is she a cyborg, but she's also forced to be the breadwinner of her adoptive mother and sisters. She works as a mechanic in the town square instead of doing what other teenage girls might enjoy. I believe many young adults can associate with the all the restrictions and rules her adoptive mother places on Cinder. All she truly wants is to be independent and be seen as a normal girl, despite all her physical flaws.<br /><br />\\"Cinder. How fitting. Ashes. Dirt. Filth.\\" I really like this quote where someone is describing Cinder's name. Her name literally means ashes, but I think the author is trying to make us see past the literal sense and witness her eventual rise from the ashes. Cinder is learning who she is and what she can do, and I think this transformation will be monumental in the books to come.<br /><br />It's interesting that Cinder meets Prince Kai right at the beginning of the book. As he enlists her help to fix his android, they engage in an odd relationship. Cinder feels attracted to him but remains distant. Prince Kai is intrigued by this unique girl. When he invites her to be his personal guest at a grand ball, he still doesn't know that she's a cyborg since Cinder is hesitant to reveal herself. The dialogue between these two characters feels strenuous at times, but overall I believe they make a nice and believable couple.<br /><br />Just for fun, I wanted to make a short list of the similarities/differences between Cinderella and Cinder.Of course, both books have Princes: Cinderella has her Prince Charming and Cinder has Prince Kai. As for the Fairy God-mother, she is replaced by Iko, Cinder's android and helpful friend. Cinderella works as a maid for her step mother, while Cinder works as a mechanic for her adoptive mother. Instead of losing a glass slipper, Cinder loses her new Cyborg foot. Cinder also makes a grand entrance and arrives at the ball in a fixed-up old car instead of a pumpkin. And, obviously, Cinderella finishes with a happy ending but in Cinder's case, the end will follow in the next books of the saga.<br /><br />Despite the similarities, one of the reasons I like this novel so much is because the author didn't necessarily concentrate on the original fairy tale story line. It's not all about finding the perfect prince. Yes, there were many similarities, but the author is also telling us the story of a futuristic Earth that is being threatened by the special and magical race of human beings living on the moon. There is also the other problem where many humans are dying from the infectious disease of letumosis.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for a fairy tale with a good ending, but even if this one doesn't end like normal one, I think it's a great beginning to an entertaining saga. The merging of a fairy tale within a science fiction realm is original and refreshing. I can think of a few modern film adaption of Cinderella but nothing comes close to Cinder.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rodgers books back in the '70's but this takes \\"romance novels\\" to a whole new level. The Steve and Ginny (Sweet Savage Love)of the 21st century are Ana and Christian.  The writing lacks a bit, I suggest you don't read anything written in italics; Ana's thoughts, which are very redundant, \\"Holy crap\\" etc. You'd think someone working for a publisher would have some variety to her thoughts. But I have to admit, I couldn't put it down and quickly downloaded the next one in the trilogy to my Kindle. Can only imagine how Ms. James did the research for these books.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for the one star rating, this maybe the first and last time I object by posting a one star for price and content.  Those of you, who are willing to waste your time telling me this is about reviewing the movies, tell me something I don't know. I will not be following this discussion, so save your time and energy with your abject criticisms. The blu-ray transfer will probably be great. The first three movies were spectacular. I agree with anyone who believes in the rip off factor.  Give me the first three movies, keep the POS crystal skull and price it so I could buy it for a reasonable $45.00 and I will delete this review and give it 5 stars.  If there are more of you who agree, give it one star...moviemakers listened when LOTR was given poor ratings, for what I call the \\"rip off factor\\"!
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I saw this movie on it's opening day release at a local theater.<br />To be quite honest, based on what I had previously heard from other people & a few reviews, I was not expecting much from this movie.<br /><br />Once the movie started, I was totally glued to the big screen & awaiting every scene like I was in the movie myself. I was Very Pleasantly Surprised with this movie!<br /><br />For starters, though the movie was very long, with it's steady pace and believable story, I never noticed the length of the movie until it was over!<br />The people watching in the theater all had their eyes glued to the screen. You could actually hear a pin drop. This movie will keep your attention!!!<br /><br />The action was fierce at times and somewhat graphic at times, but it isn't over the top & the drama, character personalities & storyline, all were very evident in the movie as well.<br /><br />This movie also Depicts the Human Will to Survive, Human Heart, the belief to fight for what you believe in no matter what the situation!!!<br /><br />Finally, what makes the movie for me for me, is THE ACTING!!!!<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence was PHENOMINAL!!!!!!!! What a performance!!! PERFECT!!!!<br />She never Flinched in her Masterful Performance!!!<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson played a very good supporting actor & did quite well in his role as well...<br /><br />This movie was a very, very good start to what hopes to be several more Lionsgate Movie Releases based on the book series...<br /><br />I would highly recommend going to see this movie on the big screen! You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />I will be reading the books soon!!!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review...
B006UTJ6DM|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorite film scores, and I am a tremendous film score buff. As a maritime historian with a particular interest in the \\"Titanic,\\" the score for this movie has captivated me from day one. I bought the original CD in November of 1997, before I ever saw the movie, and all these years later, it remains my favorite James Horner score. So it was with great anticipation that I picked this re-release up.<br /><br />The pros: CD's 1 - 3. Discs 1 and 2 of this 4-CD set are exact track and content match re-releases of \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Back to Titanic.\\" That said, the two discs have been digitally re-mastered, and they sound absolutely fantastic - better than the originals. Incredible. These two discs alone are worth the price of the set, even if you have the originals to compare them to. Disc 3 contains much of the music that would have been played aboard the ship, as recorded by I Salonisti - the musical ensemble who starred in the film. Very nice selections, and the quality is great.<br /><br />The cons: CD 4. Much of the music on this disc is simply unbearable. They are antique recordings, but many of them were recorded long after \\"Titanic\\" sank in 1912, and bear a distinctly '20's and '30's feel. They would feel right at home in a score for \\"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\\" but strike no chords to Titanic's era. The earliest recording comes from 1914, and the last was actually recorded in 1946! Even worse, not only are the recordings made in a much later, much \\"jazzier\\" style than would have been heard aboard the \\"Titanic,\\" but the actual pieces playing don't bear any resemblance to the instruments used aboard the liner. A far better choice would have been to bring in a string ensemble, such as I Salonisti, to record those same pieces - or others - in a style that would have been heard in 1912.<br /><br />Also, the much-touted quartet of baggage tags are not faithful reproductions, and bear the likeness of a ship from a much later era; finally, the \\"historical\\" commentary called \\"Ship of Dreams\\" running from pgs. 30-33 of the booklet contains numerous historical errors, perpetuates a number of popular misconceptions, and is a general mess.<br /><br />On the whole, this should have been given a bit better attention, but it's well worth the price for CD's 1-3.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Rated &#34;PG-13&#34;. Running Time: 2 hours, 03 mins.   It is the 1940's. Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) have just arrived in Paris, France. They are deeply in love. He has a job at the embassy. She decides she wants to learn how to cook professionally at Le Cordon Bleu.   In 2002, Julie (Amy Adams) and her husband, Eric Powell (Chris Messina) move into their new residence in New York City. It is above a pizzeria and next to a factory.   By day, she is a government employee who takes phone calls of complaints and problems. Her hobby is cooking and her husband likes what she cooks.   As the movie follows the life of Julia Child, we also follow the story of Julie who has decided to cook her way through Julia Child's &#34;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&#34; cookbook and write a blog about her experience for a full year.   Look quick and read backwards for a Pepsi-Cola sign.   Option of Languages: English, French, English Descriptive Services.  Option of Subtitles: English, French.   Audio Commentary with Nora Ephron.   Special Features: Special Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia.   Delightful film!  Meryl Streep makes this film fun to watch.   If you are in the baby boomer generation, you probably remember seeing Julia Child on the PBS cable stations in her cooking show, The French Chef (1963-73). It was also shown for many years in re-runs and currently on the Cooking Channel.  Did you know Julia Child was actually born in Pasadena, California, USA?   Julia Child passed away August 13, 2004 at the age of 91.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|Dusk is an amazing CD.  It should be in every collection, and how it was made makes it even more amazing.  As webmaster for Racer X (where Jeff is the lead singer), I had Jeff write about Dusk to explain it as he told me.  From this point forward, it's all Jeff. Enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Dusk, or the tunes put on the album, were intended as demos for the next Badlands album after VooDoo Hwy. We had worked up that group of tunes at rehearsals at Mates in North Hollywood two months before recording them at Good Night L.A by a friend of Ray's, Shea Baby. It's all 24 track full studio recording, but we did it all in less than 6 to 8 hours. We put the Mic's up, made sure they worked and Go! We recorded them primarily for Atlantic Records to hear and give us a budget for the full recording of the same tunes, if they liked what we had. They did not like the direction of the songs, for what ever the reason. Some months later we were dropped from Atlantic. At the time we were happy with that outcome and so was the Management, being that Atlantic was not doing anything for us anyway. We shopped new prospects. Almost every song was one-take recordings. I remember having floor Tom mic problems where we stopped to fix it, then restarted a song. But all in all, one takes. Even some endings were a little funky on my end, but Jake just flagged it off and we go to the next tune. I think Jake is the only one who did not make one mistake...if he did I did not hear it. Ray had about 50% of his lyrics together. The rest were what he called Jib-A-Jab. He would put a word or two on the front of a line and rest were all vowels. He was amazing at it, and most folks never could tell the difference. He would come up with his melody line by Jib-A-Jabbing. I think he had a harder time finding lyrics that fit his Jabbing, due to the timing and the percussive hooks he would come up with while scatting along.  Nothing on Dusk was fixed, that Ray did, obviously due to his passing before the putting together of the tracks. For him to sound like what you hear on the album one take each tune, still amazes me to no end. He was one you could say had true talent, pitch and tone. One thing I must comment about Dusk is a vision I see in my mind every time some brings up the project or I listen to it myself.  During the beginning of the song Sun Red Sun, while Jake was doing the intro, I could see Ray in the Vocal booth through a glass partition sitting on a stool giving me that charismatic smile of his. His arm held out in front of him and running his index finger back and forth across ten or twelve thin silver Indian bracelets he always wore. That's the chimes you hear in the track.\\"
B006C45MRE|5.0|I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or the features of the dvd, but I wanted to make a few comments on the movie.<br /><br />A movie that is truly just plain, mindless fun. The juxtaposition of futuristic aliens with the Old West creates one of the odder but most interesting settings of any sci-fi movie ever done. I'm surprised no one did it before--before it was such a good idea considering how well this one turned out. No doubt the movie snobs will pan it, but come on, this is a movie to just watch over beer and popcorn on a lazy weekend night. The acting was good, the script is decent, and the special effects competent and enjoyable to watch. The aliens are appropriately creepy and scary, and a worthy successor to the original Alien and Predator. Be advised there's a lot of violence and gore and so it may not be appropriate for younger viewers.<br /><br />Sci fi movie fans will recognize the homage to previous S-F movie greats such as Star Wars (advanced alien technology that looks used and old, etc.) As another reviewer here noted, Craig and Harrison play well off each other and they're the perfect choice for this duo. Olivia Wilde is also good as the alien woman but all the actors turn in decent performances. Overall, the most fun movie of the season, the most creative idea in a sci-fi movie in a long time, and please make more!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I got this game as FAOTD about a week ago. I just finished it today. I found it very entertaining when I played it online (so if you're not sure you want to get it, look it up to see if you'll like it; I'm certain you will), and was happy to see it available on my Kindle Fire. The added bonus episodes are also quite fun, and add a good value to this great app.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|This is a really decent showing by Joe Bonamossa. I don't enjoy it as much as Black Country Communion Two, but then this is a blues album (mostly) and I prefer hard rock. If I had to pick a couple tracks that I feel are the standouts, they would have to be Black Lung Heartache and Dust Bowl. The former appeals the most strongly to my hard-rock leanings: Black Lung Heartache leads in with a really cool strummed Baglama hook, and when the heavy guitar finally kicks in it it feels so... epic! Dust Bowl is my personal favorite track and I'm pretty sure this is almost entirely due to the groove JB lays down with his 4-note hook (with, I believe, a Leslie effect of some sort). This track is just one of those \\"kick back and chill\\" type of grooves that you don't really need to be in a particular mood to listen to, it's just... perfect!<br /><br />Of other note is The Last Matador of Bayonne. Really, it would be easy to overlook this track when listening to the first couple minutes because it's so mellow and understated. But at about the 2:30 mark, JB belts out an awesomely dramatic and soulful solo, making this a track worth taking a closer look at.<br /><br />There are a few tracks on this album I don't care for: Tennessee Plates and You Better Watch Yourself are probably my top picks for \\"didn't really like\\" category. With that said, they're well done tracks and from a quality perspective I can say \\"Good show!\\" but (1) I don't really care for country at all (Tennessee Plates), and (2) You Better Watch Yourself sounds a little too \\"formulaic rock-blues\\" for me and just doesn't bring much to the table. I do rather enjoy the Heartbreaker track with Glenn Hughes, but don't feel the energy I do when listing to them go at it in Black Country Communion.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a good album, with a couple really memorable songs (I get Dust Bowl stuck in my head for hours, and am quite happy for it to be there). However, there are some relatively weak tracks and I'm not sure that the album is altogether something I would give to someone if they were listing to him for the very first time and I wanted them to become an instant fan. I really feel THAT album is probably Black Country Communion 2. Now there's some smokin' hot music!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and its FREE there are a ton of different games. to play its sooooo much fun
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Recently, listening to KCSM and KSDS, going about my business, I kept being brought up short by a certain vocalist.  Over and over.  Finally ordered this CD.<br /><br />Well it's obvious Mr Porter has got it all goin' on.  Been listening to jazz for 40 years, never heard anyone quite like him.  What strikes me is that the sum of the parts convey a terrific emotional depth, moving really, that is hard to describe.  Credit must be shared with his sidemen -- the arrangements are wonderful.<br />A truly fresh talent.  Love this recording.<br /><br />And to think he went to college on a football scholarship !! ??
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is easy to navigate, great for quik reference of weather when you're in a hurry and is accurate for our very rural valley area. I like this better than other weather apps.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|As a Floyd Fan this is the best way to continue \\"The Wall\\" expirience in my life. I have the many versions of this work: cassette, the original CD print, and many others and I do love this Box Set...the demos were great and just for that is worth every cent. Of course I'd love to have a full live concert video in Blu - Ray or a remaster of the movie; but all the extras were great. I'm planning to get the other 2 box set of DSOTM and WYWH.<br /><br />Great for anyone that has not listened this masterpiece in a while.

0385535139|1.0|I am about 1/3 of the way in, and I am having a hard time 1) Staying awake, 2) Staying focused, 3)Staying interested.<br />Not one lovable character, not one compelling arc! I am going to finish it, because there has to be more to this book!<br />Okay, update - finished the book a long time ago, and have decided it turned out to be pretty good once we finally got to<br />the court room scenes. Grisham really should just stick to the courtroom / law stuff, because that is what works for him.<br />The first 1/3 of the book was just so painful. I wouldn't say it necessarily redeemed itself after that, but I did get a little payoff from finishing it.
1594202842|4.0|I recently selected this book for my book club (which is part of the mom's group I'm part of).  I figured it would be an entertaining read, and probably create some spirited discussion.  I found that to be true in both cases.  I didn't agree with the degree to which she pushed both her children.  Mastering an instrument was a requirement not to be questioned.  Reading about how she got up at the crack of dawn to learn the piano and violin beside her daughters, in addition to overseeing their studies, write numerous books, and teach law classes at Ivy League colleges, made me exhausted.  She seemed pretty honest about herself, revealing how she was an extremely critical, and often times hurtful, person.  Although she remained critical of \\"Western parenting\\", she did end up coming around when she realized she could be permanently damaging the relationship with her younger daughter. This is not a book that you read for parenting advice, although the author does have at least a few good points, believe it or not.  I think the biggest takeaway was that it's ok, and actually necessary, to have high expectations of your child.  I don't aspire to be a Tiger Mother, but don't want to be a totally laid back \\"Western\\" parent either.  Hopefully I'll be able to find a happy medium.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|very fun and challenging game! had no issues playing, I think the force close was fixed. game is long took me about a week and half to finish, there are also three bonus levels I haven't played yet. definately worth the price, I got it free but still would pay the full price.
0062082353|4.0|If you turn to the pictures section, look on the second page, right hand side, on the bottom. It says, \\"General Peter Pace, the head of the JCOS, hands me.....\\" BUT, that's not General Pace, that's General Norton Schwartz, the USAF Chief of Staff. He has pilot wings, and AF-only ribbons. Also, I looked up General Pace and Norty. They look similar, but it is obvious that the man presenting the award is General Schwartz. I wonder what else is incorrect? Either way, AWESOME book.
B006ISJQ3K|4.0|a wonderful cd Diana brings her clasic sound with a few new ones a cd that every colllector must have  we just love it
B006OCM0G0|5.0|awesome I think that the game should get five stars at minimum parents should buy this app for there children
B003O86FMW|4.0|This review is not just about Catching Fire, but the trilogy as a whole, which presumably most will finish. I posted this review under the first book as well.  To put this in perspective, I'm a 40 year old male who generally enjoys Michael Connelly and Harlan Coben. I read the trilolgy due to all the hype and at the recommendation of others. When I was on vacation recently, about 7 people were reading it by the pool, and not one person was under 45! It's about a dystopian, futuristic North America, now called Panem, divided into 12 districts and run by the opressive Capitol. Each year, a boy and girl from each district must fight to the death in an arena in a competition known as the Hunger Games. It also deals with the struggle between the people and the government. It's a mix of Lord of the Flies, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Mad Max, and The Running Man.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1. A great, fun adventure/sci fi story. It's worth reading for this alone.<br /><br />2. Good character development.<br /><br />3. The first-person-present-tense delivery is an effective literary device that works well for this story.<br /><br />The Bad (which are really \\"nitpicks\\" for adult readers):<br /><br />1. It's somewhat of a Harry Potter rip off with terms like Quarter Quell and characters named Plutarch Heavensbee.<br /><br />2.

Just kick back and enjoy it.
B003NTSBUG|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie to watch until the end changed the whole story line.  Didn't like the ending.  It's hard to accept the ending.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This review is not just about HG, but the trilogy as a whole, which presumably most will finish.  To put this in perspective, I'm a 40 year old male who generally enjoys Michael Connelly and Harlan Coben.  I read the trilolgy due to all the hype and at the recommendation of others.  When I was on vacation recently, about 7 people were reading it by the pool, and not one person was under 45!  It's about a dystopian, futuristic North America, now called Panem, divided into 12 districts and run by the opressive Capitol.  Each year, a boy and girl from each district must fight to the death in an arena in a competition known as the Hunger Games.  It also deals with the struggle between the people and the government.  It's a mix of Lord of the Flies, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Mad Max, and The Running Man.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1. A great, fun adventure/sci fi story.  It's worth reading for this alone.<br /><br />2. Good character development.<br /><br />3. The first-person-present-tense delivery is an effective literary device that works well for this story.<br /><br />The Bad (which are really \\"nitpicks\\" for adult readers):<br /><br />1. It's somewhat of a Harry Potter rip off with terms like Quarter Quell and characters named Plutarch Heavesnbee.<br /><br />2. Prose/syntax: Ms. Collins overuses fragmented sentences (perhaps to add to the whole dark, dystopian setting) throughout the trilogy, which makes the prose very choppy at times.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great series and I think many of the negative reviewers are over-analyzing.  Just kick back and enjoy it.
B002UEW31I|3.0|Rewrite of history is OK, but not great.  It's a fun movie to watch.  Was disappointed I purchased instead of rented.  Couldn't find a link to rent.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like this game. It s not like Cate World in that you can't save your neighbors dishes but it s still entertaining.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love angry birds and this is by far the best one yet but I wish that it would let me get the other worlds I heat it in one day and I want another challenge. please send an update.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Got the app because of the reviews of Amazon. Everyone was right. The game is entertaining and lots of fun. Thanks for being free.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so much fun and super addicting! I wake up @ 6am just to play this game! This game is one of those things you just have 2 have in life
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great read, especially if you're a fan of the 80's, I couldn't put it down once I started.  There are a lot of references to a lot of childhood memories in this book and that was part of the appeal.  Although I felt that the ending was a little typical and expected, it didn't take anything away from the story.  I really hope that this does indeed become a movie, I'll be in line for that ticket for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game...it seems a little difficult to unlock other games but I like the concept a lot. definitely worth it
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I looked for the longest for a collage maker app to try to make my own colleges. I never have before, but this apps collage feature works great and very easily. I'm not very tecchie. but ive already made 2 gorgeous collages. This app lets you crop easily, lets you blur, sharpen, adjust saturation, etc. all the basics and most importantly, lets you get pictures from a variety of great sources as well as send them to a variety of great sources like Picasso, Google and Flickr just to name a few. Easy Peasy to use., a child could do it. High quality/resolution.  Download Now! And extra bonus: its free, so what have you got to lose :)
0738727326|5.0|This deck is amazingly beautiful! When learning about Tarot reading, many guides tell you to look at each card and imagine yourself entering the world in the card and interacting with it. I had always thought this was a bit silly, but this deck didn't just allow me to do that, it sucked me in! I was in awe as I looked through this deck for the first time. I don't own many tarot decks, but that's largely because I feel confident that I'll never be as happy with another deck as I am with this deck. The readings done with this deck so far have been very good as well; relevant and meaningful. Great buy!
1582701709|5.0|It was the best price I found online, it came right when it said it was and it was a New book.  Very Happy
B005I2YL4G|4.0|This processor does \\"just enough\\" to make the basic user happy. I built a machine for a friend who only wanted to browse in the internet, watch the occasional video, and have their kids use the machine for homework and it's been more than enough power for it. Runs Windows 7 like a breeze (although the system does have 8GB of RAM installed). I wouldn't recommend it for heavy gamers or heavy multitaskers, but for casual use you don't need much more. Not having to spend the money for extra graphics helps keep costs down and this thing seems to sip on power.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|I understood where the author was planning to take this series with the third book, but I was very disappointed in it. The main character became annoying and had me so frustrated that I almost did not bother to finish reading the last novel. The idea for this book was great, and it had lots of potential, but fell short on delivery. I would definitely recommend the first two books in the series as a must read, however the third one is an optional read in my mind.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is a must have if you download PDF digital content.  I highly recommend it.  Very worth it.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Great second book in the Hunger Games series. I was not sure how the author was going to be able to keep the series going, but it had some good twists and was definitely worth the read. The author managed to make it different enough from the first novel to still be entertaining while continuing to build the story line. If you have read Hunger Games, then make sure you continue with this one.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|i think this was a decent book but more faced towards the younger croud. Personally i think Enders Game is one of my all time faavorites.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Now video playback is smooth for video.  They really stepped it up in fixing issues without waiting for an OS rev.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Everyone knows the music so I'm focusing on how it's presented.  Cool trinkets and memorabilia are here but I think most of us are interested in hearing this music in the most amazing way possible.  The Amazon site fails to identify that the bluray disc includes a high resolution original Quad mix.  It's delivered in uncompressed 24/96 and it's wonderful.  This is for DSOTM and Floyd diehards.  If you are just looking for a superb high resolution stereo or 5.1 mix you can buy the SACD far cheaper than this set.  But if you want to hear what Quad of the '70s sounded like when implemented without the low fidelity of an 8-track or the technical problems of delivering it via vinyl then get this.  Back then the only way to properly deliver Quad was via open reel.  This mix is the biggest reason to buy this set.  If you like it then don't hesitate to buy the Wish You Were Here Immersion set too.  It also has a high res Quad mix on the bluray.  If you have a serious multi-channel system you need to experience this.  The Quad version is a substantially different experience than the 5.1 mix.  Which one is better?  Whichever is playing!<br /><br />Amazon correctly identifies that there is an original stereo mix also in 24/96 uncompressed.  This is the original Alan Parsons mix from the '70s.  It's excellent and this is the only place to get it as far as I know.  The Guthrie remaster is also here in high res.  To my knowledge, this is the only place to get the Quad mix and the original stereo mix in high resolution.  The improvement in sound quality over CD isn't subtle.  Enjoy!
0307592731|5.0|Torn between savoring slowly or inhaling at warp speed, I could not put this one down. Warmly human, yes. Insightful and honest, yes. Captivatingly well written, without a doubt. There's value here if you appreciate courageous personalities or just enjoy a good adventure. It's both and so much more.  Strayed writes with a rare clarity of heart that resonates on every page. Just flipping awesome!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great ..I love how there are so many games for one free app ...definitely whole downland this app
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I really hated the ending. What happened to katniss? She lost all control - it was just like before the hunger games. What a shame..<br /><br />Disappointing ending to a series.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is a bomb to me I mean I don't think any of my friend ever played this game. So my friends should really play it.
0767830555|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  The symbolism behind DeNiro's character Travis Bickle, is a true reflection of countless personalities. A must see.
B002BWP49C|1.0|Of all the Twillight Movies so far this is the most boring one of the lot . I Just hope part 2 the final one of the series is a lot better.
B004AOECUG|3.0|Boring.  Why this movie was nominated for numerous academy awards is baffling.  It is a disjointed story of a boxer who leads a deviant lifestyle outside the ring.  Not worth the money, pass on it.
1423101499|4.0|My son has read every Rick Riordan book published. He is always waiting for the next book. If your child loves fantasy. These are great books for them to read.
098478280X|5.0|I have not finished but a very good book for learning, refreshing and seeing what areas you are lacking in CS knowledge.<br />Just from what I have read so far it has enlightened by brain again.<br />I definitely saw some concepts I was cold on when I went to a company(yahoo)  interview recently.
B000000OUJ|5.0|If you're on the fence with getting this, get off it and just do it.  Obviously all the Wu fans know and love Liquid Swords.<br />But for those who don't listen to hip hop or were born after or were too young to appreciate it, Liquid Swords is the pinnacle of 90's hip hop.  When I first listened to this on CD, it blew me away.  Much the same way Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, and Demanufacture did.  Obviously, I'm a big thrash metal fan.  But Liquid Swords transcends genres and is a musical masterpiece, worthy of any collection, regardless of the genre you normally enjoy.
B00756GKBA|1.0|Gotta hand it to Madonna she knows how to be original!...I mean who else could play an April Fools Joke of this scale???....Great idea releasing a truly horrible album for april fools but enough already where is the real album??? COZ THIS CANT BE IT!!!
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I'm sure you've read enough reviews telling you how awesome the movie is, so I am focusing on people's complaints.<br /><br />Anything that is missing from the books was because it wasn't that important to the movie, I believe. The mockingjay pin does have a different back story than the book, but it's not that big of a problem; the cornucopia was strange looking, but it was easier to see the struggle on top actually taking place; I do agree Haymitch should have been in it more, but Katniss's struggle in the arena wasn't fully shown and I can understand that it really wasn't necessary to show every little thing that happened.<br /><br />Overall I believe it was a faithful adaption from one of my favorite series. The use of no music was totally unexpected and it's truly genius because you still feel the tension, the heartache, and the love. Another genius idea was to show what was happening outside of the arena. Jennifer Lawrance is Katniss and I'm looking forward to Catching Fire!
0439023513|5.0|The end its beautiful, painful and real.  It goes beyond what I was expecting from a Young Adult series.  Pick it up, dont doubt about it.
0823095223|5.0|I really enjoyed this book about the ins and outs of producing pop sculpture and action figures. The sections on mold making answered a lot of questions I had and helped me make better molds and castings from them. I highly recommend this book to all aspiring pop sculptors out there or anyone curious about the process involved in creating collectible figures.
0452273331|4.0|Set in the world of architecture and the arts, 'The Fountainhead' tells the roles and lives of four influential people.<br /> Peter Keating. An ambitious but mediocre architect who rises to the top through patronage and plagiarism.<br /> Ellsworth Toohey,an Iago like figure, who manipulates and grooms public opinion.An advocate of alturism and collectivism which he uses to exploit others for his own political ambitions.<br /> Gail Wynand, the born poor, made good (but unfullfilled) ruthless newspaper baron who shamelessly courts and creates popular public opinion which gives him vast wealth and associated power.<br /> Howard Roark, a maligned genius who lives for the pure joy of creating and existing.<br /> And intertwined is the beautiful Dominique Francon....<br /> Rand uses their stories to illustrate her philosophy of 'Objectivism';the individual spirit and freedom of man against collectivism;that mankinds advances are made by individual freethinkers who are always hated by mob man,who only benefits-ultimately-from these advances. The mob man who cannot invent and lives of the backs of those that do.<br /> When Rand wrote this (1943) the world was very much dominated by collectives-from communism on the left to fascism on the right with laissez faire to dogmatic socialism in between. It was an age where freedom of the individual was much under threat, and Rand wasn't alone in this idea or feeling. George Orwell-no less-recreates Rands distopian collectivism oppressing the freedom of man in '1984' and 'Animal Farm'(With 'Keep the Aspidistra Flying' as a prequel where Gordon Comstock is forced into conformity)<br /> As a novel, 'The Fountainhead' -for me who has read both authors;I know fans of either will be up in arms!-is very much like the works of Upton Sinclair ('Oil!' for eg) as both use very stylised characactures (pantomime ?)to illustrate their philosophies and ideologies,albeit from different sides of the fence.Realism isn't what its really about. Initially, it was difficult to see who were Rand's heroes and villans, and Dominiques relations to Roark are quite bizarre. But it all adds up by the end of the novel and it is a good read for all that.<br />  Rand seems to provoke violent reactions, but having actually read this work and understood her philosophy, it definately does have a place in modern debate, and I seriously doubt-now- that her fiercest critics have actually read beyond a precis,second hand opinions,or a few chapters.(And the same goes for some of her most ardent fanatics!)<br /> Rands philosophy is observable. From the damning of Galileo and Da Vinci (would we have been flying way before the Wright brothers if his ideas were pursued?) to the religious 'collectives' of Iran and Pakistan today-all of whom rely on a free thinking inventive west for any technology they have. They are Rand's 'Second Handers' without a doubt. And where free West Germany made the BMW and Mercedes, collective East Germany gave the world the Trabant! But the problem-as with all ideologies- is that they want to be absolute, and its more this 'absolutism' that destroys freedoms.Man exists somewhere inbetween all of them. And not to forget, probably mankinds greatest ever achievement came about through collective thought and invention; the Apollo mission.<br />  An unlikely legacy of Rand ? When Roark built Monadnock, the developers thought it would be a sure fire failure and sold 200% worth of stock in it. It was a success and they went to jail. Was Mel Brookes inspired by this to write 'The Producers'?! And a billboard advertising 'Romeo and Juliet' as a simple love story; 'A boy from the Bronx meets a girl from Brooklyn'.....'West Side Story'??<br /> To keep ahead of all angles of every debate,'The Fountainhead' is a very good read.lly, it was difficult to see who were Rand's heroes and villans, and Dominiques relations to Roark are quite bizarre.

B001E45XT4|1.0|Really wished I had listened to the harsh reviews here, they were certainly spot on! I just got this today, after paying almost $9 for shipping and waiting 5 days, only to discover the darn mic doesn't work. Never buying another headset again. Was really depending on this for gaming/casual voice chat.<br /><br />Thanks a lot, Platronics. I'll be taking my money back now. You can keep your plastic piece of crap.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|West Wing is one of the best shows ever produced and is as relevant today as it was a decade ago! This package is amazing, you have all the seasons together, plus some extra goodies and it looks great. Anyone that likes politics will love this package.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I always wondered if anyone would be able to successfully make an entertaining film adaptation of Marvel's Captain America, Considering that the first attempt was pretty lame but this movie was great. Though i feel its lacking some of the qualities that \\"Iron-Man\\" had in terms of how entertaining the story is, this movie still delivers and the improvements on Cap's costume are awesome, which i always felt would be particularly difficult to do considering the character was created quite a long time ago (and the costume hadn't changed much since then). Great movie, can't wait to see the Avengers,
B000PDYVVG|4.0|She's a wonderful writer, great story teller, God bless her. But as a similarly aged woman who traveled on her own around the world, everyone naturally now compares me to her story and assumes I \\"had a romp around the world.\\"  Can we just clear up the fact that not all women are in search of love and men while traveling?  Thank you. There are many reasons people/women go traveling, maybe meeting men is one of them. And perhaps \\"finding yourself\\" is another -- but most women are going to discover how the world ticks and stretch their own comfort zones.  Thank you for the entertaining story, Elizabeth.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Forget about those silly \\"90210\\" characters! Who cares about the latest fashion trends of Kim Kardashian? Step aside, Paris Hilton!<br /><br />Welcome Emily Thorne! Here's an admirable socialite who really knows how to spend her time and money wisely!<br /><br />If you are a victim of heinous crime or know someone who is, you need to watch and learn from this inspirational series! Emily's actions are justified and narrated through a series of flashbacks that are well crafted into each episode and \\"take down\\" of an enemy. Look at how all those evil people plotted to destroy her when she was just a cute, little child! First, they took away her daddy and murdered him through the \\"legal system\\", locked the little Emily (aka. Amanda Clarke) away, then brainwashed her into believing that her daddy was a bad guy. These cruel and unusual actions show that just because something is processed through the \\"legal system\\" or criminal justice system isn't always legal even though the process might APPEAR to be. Appearance can be illusionary as this series will prove. You will feel for Emily's character! Far from being \\"revenge\\", Emily teaches us what true justice is.<br /><br />Plot, plan, exact justice when the corrupt System doesn't work for innocent people! There's nothing better than taking justice in your own hands when everyone and everything has been taken away from you!<br /><br />What an inspiration, Emily Thorne! You go, girl!

B007JCP8FE|4.0|I've been a Shinedown fan since Fly From the Inside hit the airwaves.  I've enjoyed watching them progress as a band, each CD bringing some more polish and something new to the equation.  Us and Them was Leave a Whisper on steroids with a nice coat of paint over the top.  They made a huge jump musically with \\"The Sound of Madness\\" into an ... well, I wouldn't call it Arena rock, but it was a sound that alternated between frenetic and polished pop-rock and did both REALLY well.<br /><br />Looking at it like that, Amaryllis is to The Sound of Madness what Us and Them was to Leave a Whisper.  It continues the trajectory they outlined in Sound of Madness while throwing in a few tricks that are largely just flourishes (more orchestral and electronic sounds) on the tried and true Shinedown sound.<br /><br />To put it more concisely, if you liked where they went with Sound of Madness you'll like Amaryllis.  It's not a reinvention, but would you really want that?  It's just more of that awesome Shinedown Rock, and I'll certainly lay down my nine bucks for that!
0385534639|5.0|I think this is the most visual-invoking book I have ever read and I can't wait for the inevitable movie to follow. I just hope it's not Tim Burton.

B0070DOHQS|4.0|Great App. Very lite and easy to setup. You do not have install their Jump client app on you PC if you do not want to as it uses RDP which is already built into Windows.. Just turn it on under your Computer properties and your good to go!!<br /><br />Also when in windows everything is very responsive.  I like their circle/pointer setup as well. It lets you use the mouse pointer and it keeps you fingers out of the way.

B005J2UM9S|1.0|Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't usually write reviews, but this was so horrible, that I felt the need to warn others. This has lots of good reviews - maybe they were paid off like the landscape guy in the film.
B007JRU2UK|2.0|I loved Sideways, thought it was one of the best movies in recent years, was even more amazed when I read the novel and found it was crude and dumb, and had been transmuted into something deep and true by Alexander Payne. So I was hopeful when I streamed this. But it ain't the same. A promising story is somehow manacled rather than liberated. There are several problems. First, Payne labors mightily to try to make the story be about Hawaii. But it isn't. Sideways was about wine and the wine country, because the two most important characters (played by Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen) had the love and lore of wine in their DNA, found each other through wine -- the Giamatti character was even symbolized by Pinot Noir. Wine is more than a character in the movie: it's the very language of the movie. It's also a litmus test of every character, and the wine country as mission (for Giamatti) and escape (for Haden Church) exposes their souls. But this time you could pull the main story out of Hawaii and it would be the same. It's about how a physical accident can expose the fault lines in a family - anywhere. The endless travelogue scenery is poured over the story like a bad Hollandaise over an underdone egg. Then there's Clooney. For my money this guy has elevated \\"bad casting\\" to a career path. What I mean is, even when he gives a fairly good performance he is always miscast, because there's something about him that defies our \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\". I mean, you can just never really think he's going through the events depicted. In Sideways I never thought for a moment I was seeing any acting. With Clooney you always think, \\"Oh, George is pretending to be _____.\\" In most of his roles he has consistently looked like a man who knows he's on camera and feels smug about it. In this film he almost slips out of both those nooses, but there's just something about that face - especially the mouth - that makes us unable to take him seriously. Maybe it's vulnerability that doesn't work... think of Cary Grant at his most suave, and there's still this quality of the vulnerable - this uncertainty about the outcome, will he be okay or not? Anyway it's a fair story, and Clooney does an excellent job, as do many other cast members, but like I said, he is miscast, because once again, he's in a movie.

B00008973A|3.0|I saw this when it came out and was utterly riveted by it, in characters, acting, singing, dance.  It stuck with me for over 35 years, in my imagination.  So I got this for my daughter, who loves show musicals.  Alas, it simply did not translate well into cinema.  There are many problems with the production.  The singing, acting, and - in the way that hollywood makes things so stupidly explicit - the plot.  Instead of a glimpse, with many things implied but never completely spelled out in spite of the rawness of the bway script, the film turns it into a lousy melodrama and takes the characters just that little bit too far as a way of implying depth.  For that, it was nearly terrible.  What the production did convey extremely well - hence 3 and not 2 stars - was the dance.  It made me want to dance and I was in awe of the talent there, which may be one reason why the actors were largely unknowns and, frankly, so bad at everything else.  I did enjoy talking about it with my daughter and it is toned down somewhat.<br /><br />If you want to re-experience the bway show, don't get this.  It can't really stand on its own either, but isn't a total bomb.

B005GVA2L0|3.0|I'll be honest, this is nowhere as good as their debut album. It sounds like there's no true feeling or effort in the music. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it was a present for my wife and she loves it. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I would personally not add it to my own collection. Amy Lee, it's sad to see you go the way of Metallica and sell out.
0439023513|4.0|I am very sad to see the end of this series, but it has definitely been an amazing ride. Suzanne Collins is an amazing author who deserves to win awards over this series and i cannot wait for the movies, but i know she will definitely see some awards there. Maybe not personal awards, but the actors will definitely win something because of her. I was obsessed with Mockingjay from page one and had to force myself to put it down. The ending was positive, but i thought it was going to be a little more frilly and happy go-lucky instead of being a worse than reality like it was. I think Collins wanted to keep it as realistic as possible.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Not an instant classic but it has some very interesting songs that make the album special, I like the new sounds and the new beats, this is one of the things that Madonna has always done best
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I'd have to say I am pleased with this cpu, I am somewhat of a power user and this processor was a bit more powerful than I currently needed, however, I think it was still a good investment and will give me a little future proofing. Note: My second choice was the 2500K which is a good alternative if you do not need hyperthreading.
1596680199|5.0|If you are going to buy a book on Polymer Clay Beads, get this one. This has EVERYTHING!! I have several other books on the subject and none are as complete as this one. Very easy to understand and the best information. [[ASIN:1596680199 Making Polymer Clay Beads]]
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This book is exceptional!  The numbers do not lie.  117- 5 star reviews on Amazon means something. Make no mistake this is the best book in the series by far.  So when you want to read on the books are good but are not even in the same league as this one.  Don't bother with True Colors.  Super short novella that is not worth the money it should be free.
0689835604|4.0|The way the flaps are set up, its hard to lift even as an adult.  My 18mth old has a hard time finding where to lift and to get the tabs to lift.  That is my biggest complaint.  Otherwise its a great book for learning parts of the body.  I read the book and point to the characters in the book, ie see the babies toes?!  And then touch/wiggle his toes so he starts relating what we are talking about.  Cute book, just wish it was easier to lift the tabs on.  You better have nails!  I might have to rig the book so its easier for him to lift, since he likes to lift them up himself.

141694737X|5.0|I don't normally do reviews, that is how much I love this book.  I was looking for some new books as my lil guy is just now showing an interest in being read to.  I got this book since he loves animals.  He LOVES lifting the flaps to reveal the animals and caught on to the concept immediately and he laughs every time he gets to lift the flap to show the animal.  He starts giggling the moment he sees the book and always wants me to read it.  Its now the grand finale at night time and the last book we read.<br /><br />Its short enough to keep his attention and he is starting to learn the animals and the sounds they make since when we lift the flap I say the animal and then I make the sound and say what color it is.  So if you read it like that, its also educational.  We have read it every night for a week and he is all boy and so far it has held up and proven to be tough.  I hope to find more books like this!<br /><br />He loves this book so much that I plan on buying some for his daycare and babyshower gifts.
B00751KMYQ|3.0|Amazon needs to do better on the pricing for single episodes. I purchased this by accident, as I would never pay 2.00 for 20 mins of entertainment. But, I was indeed entertained.
B00783NWB6|1.0|Ultra violet is worthless!  I have yet to read a review where anyone has stated that they are sure glad that digital copy is gone and replaced by a inconsistent, inaccessible, frustrating sea of sign-in's.  You are loosing me as a customer.
0143038583|5.0|Fascinating book on the state of food consumption in the United States. The book is presented in 4 sections and I will not do them justice here with my simple summaries. In section one he follows corn through the production cycle as it involves food. This chapter is a shocker and will really open your eyes to how integrated corn is within the American diet, plus it will show how much corn you are eating. It makes me rethink the corn is responsible for obesity rather than dismiss it as extremism. Understand that isn't necessarily Pollan's position.<br /><br />In part two he buys a baby cow and then follows him through his entire life cycle to the slaughterhouse. While not judging, he does present a fairly stark and accurate picture of factory animal production. In part three he travels to an alternative farm and spends a week working the land with the owners. It demonstrates the value of small scale responsible farming while at the same time showing a nice slam on the bunk that is the current \\"Organic\\" policy in the US, especially people who shop at Whole foods or the specialty section of their local grocery store.<br /><br />Finally he goes hunting, both for feral pig and mushrooms. He had never been hunting before (and I can empathize with that) but he states he is ashamed to say how exciting and empowering it was. Ultimately his goal was to prepare a full meal for the people he met in the book utilizing only food he found, killed, or grew. Anotherwords he wanted to use \\"non barcoded food\\". Not as easy as you would think.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a very interesting book which will motivate you to look at your food choices more closely. It even made me want to farm a little. But given I work in the food industry, maybe you won't find it as good as I did.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I lived near Bowling Green, Ohio when the real incident took place. I can remember the excitement generated as we followed the developments on TV. The real event, though worrysome, was not nearly as dramatic as the movie which relocates it to Pennsylvania rather than rural Ohio. I thought the acting, special effects and story-line were all well done. Watching it on Blue Ray with a Bose surround system was fantastic. It is a great family movie, though in places it may be a little intense for very young children.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|Doesn't include the level danger zone like the 99 cent one three bucks and two levels I would recommend to wait till a 99 cent one comes out but it still is fun just not as fun as the 99 cent one that comes with the mighty eagle for free
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read this book the first time right after it was published.<br />And I wasn't a fan. I thought it was needlessly grim and depressing.<br />Catastrophic loss after catastrophic loss, it almost hurt to read.<br />I mean no character in the history of literature has experienced as much pain and suffering on more levels than even our nightmares could comprehend as our beloved Katniss.<br /><br />I was irritated and annoyed that Suzanne Collins ended on such a bloody awful note.<br /><br />But, after seeing the movie I decided to reread the whole series, see if reading it as one long run on experience made some sense of what I felt was a stinky ending.<br /><br />And that is why I'm bothering to write a review, when thousands have already reviewed it.<br /><br />It's not that I've changed my mind about the negatives, it's just that I feel that his book, in all it's brutality, deserves a second chance.<br /><br />Because maybe, like me you'll realize that beneath the unbelievable carnage, deep loss and the multiple messages about society.<br />This is probably the most realistic ending to a story of an extraordinary girl who goes through hell, somehow survives it...and the boy who loves her.<br />Always.
1400069289|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim, and then I couldn't put it down! As much as habits are part of daily life, I had never stopped to consider how important they are and how they can be changed/improved. I am recommending this book to everyone I know!
B002QW7ALM|2.0|A couple of space farers wake out of \\"hypersleep\\" (most of us would use the term \\"cryogenic\\" but given that the author clearly failed highschool science class, this is nit picking). It is shortly established that they are brain damaged from their long hibernation.... and the plot and writing go rapidly down hill from there.<br /><br />There are carnivorous monsters on board and shortly after you see them, you pretty much know where they came from, long before the \\"shocking\\" expostulation.<br />Upon hearing it, you are left with the choice of blaming the exedition planners or the screenplay writer for smoking way too much crack.<br /><br />The ship (the primary antagonist for too much of the film) is designed with such a breath-taking lack of common sense that it must have been designed by a congressional committee. Note that the bulkhead doors trap you if the power goes out (unless a monster wants to get through one, then it just pushes open). Preciesly what you want in an emergency, everyone trapped behind a bulkhead so they can't fix the problem, unless there's a hull breach on the other side and then the doors just open.<br />On the fun side you can run your computer systems for hours with a few spins of a hand crank (makes you wonder why you even need a nuclear reactor to run the ship when hand cranks work so well - better to peddle your way to the stars).<br /><br />At one point you get to see the exterior of the ship itself and then the reason for the design issues become clear... the architechts were clearly vetrans of \\"hypersleep\\"..... way too much hypersleep.<br /><br />And All of this is forgivable if the plot hangs together.... not really.<br />Cliced mistakes that make you wince over and over and wonder whether you should care if anyone survives this poorly concieved flight. And then they make sure that you don't just near the end.<br /><br />Great Actors and direction. Great special effects and hence two stars.<br />(Note - no subtractions for wasting talents like Dennis Quaid and the others who actually contributed here.... and there were many, more's the pity.)<br /><br />The producer and screenwriter, however, shouldn't be allowed near a budget larger than a handicam and luch money if for no better reason than to protect the viewing public.<br /><br />They took a marvelously talented crew and made a lousy movie.
B0036T32LQ|1.0|Drawn out..... one does not need to see the same thing over and over and over (albeit 'different' scenes being replayed) in order to get the \\"concept\\".<br />a good 40mins of wasted effort waiting for some 'development' to occur. Finally get's around to 'summarizing' the concept/plot in the last 20mins. BUT again, relies on 'repetition' to carry the point.  Nice/interesting concept, but could use a more creative method; instead of  'delivery' by repetition.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|so I bot this game cause I love angry birds.so I started playing it and it was fun.it has great graghics and the new birds are cool because its just different have new things on the game.the gravity feilds help a lot and the diffrent planets is cool. most createtive angry birds yet.most fun angry birds yet!!!!!!!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|As I browsed books in this genre, I came across The Forever Girl and read its blurb. I was a little skeptical at first (I'm a very picky reader) but decided to purchase the book regardless. I must say I am very glad I did! The story is beautifully written to engage the reader as well as an emotional overall tone with descriptive imagery. Rebecca Hamilton did an amazing job creating the foundation for what it sure to be an exciting and fresh series!! Definitely on the look out for the next one and am absolutely looking forward to Sophia's growth!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and its sequels.I found that she captured the essence of the moral ambiguity that life offers.Her characters,while engaging, live in shades of grey.Unlike Harry Potter- while extremely engaging- the morally expected outcome is not cast in stone.Characters are flawed- seriously so- and the hook is complex: her characters are both compelling and flawed.And isn't that life? While directed at a teen audience I found these books to be not just palatable but riveting to an older audience- we are engaged because we have ( many of us) observed,first hand, the complexities and ambiguities of our lives and decisions.I heartily recommend these books- these are not Twilight- (porno bland) but these serve I believe to challenge us with important question couched in a drama palatable to all: why are we here? what is true? and what,fundamentally,do I stand for?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know that I should not of done this but, I went and saw the movie but I didn't read the book. But after the movie I really want to read the trilogy!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Okay, I admit I'm a late comer to the whole Hunger Game thing.  I didn't really know anything about it before last week, when I kept seeing the title and the movie info pop up all over my Facebook feed.  I ignored it until I heard an interview with the movie actors in NPR, and there was discussion regarding how wonderful the books were, that they had caused a stir with adults as well as the young adults they were geared for, and so on.  Since I love books, I figured I could throw down the $5 for the Kindle version and check it out myself.  And, believe me, I was not disappointed.  I was immediately drawn to the complexity and guarded honesty of Katniss, the main character, and the ordeal she was about to face.  I appreciate the nuances of the horror of this story, but the bravery in which the author doesn't sugar coat it.  I love that Katniss is not some superhuman that does amazing superhuman things, but rather a girl who is smart and gets lucky, too.  I love the tacit questions this books raises as it relates to society, the focuses and power struggles that exist, and our part in it.  I think this is a well written book with a real story that goes beyond the characters - a story with such depth I am still discovering it even after finishing the last sentence.  I look forward to the other two books in the trilogy.
B00756GKBA|2.0|This CD is a very poor effort. The songwriting and instrumentation on nearly all of the tunes sounds cliche/amateur in nature. The Music and American Life releases were professionally executed and contained some tunes that were unique, well-crafted and generally consumable. I want a refund.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I have purchased this watch about 4 months ago and it just died on me after 2 months. Ever since then I'm trying to replace it with Garmin and they are giving me the hardest time. They made me ship it on my expense to the UK and now they want me to pay for the shipment back which together cost more than the watch itself. I have never seen such bad customer service in my life. bottom line almost 2 months after I sent it and I still don't have the watch back.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|AMAZING!! One of the best book series I have ever read. I do think that parents should not be allowing their children to be reading it however. I work in an elementary school and 3rd graders are reading them. The books are meant for young adult readers, which means ages 13-18!!! Let's keep it that way.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have read four of the novels so far and enjoyed them.  I was curious as to how this epic could be converted to a film considering the wealth of characters and numerous subplots.  As I do not get HBO I invested in the DVD set and was not disappointed one iota.  The casting was marvelous - the cinematography is superb - and it is actually easier to follow than the book.  I am usually disappointed when books are made into video presentations, be it in theaters or on TV.  I can honestly say it is marvelous in it's scope and delivery. Yes, it is gory and there is frequent nudity and sexuality but it is not done tastelessly. To me it was excellent start to finish and I can not wait to see the second season. The set is well worth the price and I hope to be able to continue purchasing the series.  It will be interesting to see how many books they end up doing.  Hopefully, there will not be a six year wait as there was between several of the books.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished the last book today. I do not feel like the author rushed the last book as someone mentioned. Collins took her time, weaving her story and completely capturing my attention. Once I finished the first book I bought on a whim at the grocery store, I had to buy the next two on my Kindle so I didn't have to wait!! When I was finally done with the trilogy I didn't know whether to cry from happiness, sadness, or a mixture of both. Few books have moved my emotions, and this set really did.
1451627289|3.0|If you are looking for a book for your summer vacation reading and are considering this one, here's the good news, it's a page-turner, and it's 850 pages long - plenty of heft there for a week on the beach or by the pool.<br /><br />The problem is that it's really not that interesting. Certainly, if you are attracted by the book because you like alternate histories and are eager to see what a talented and well-researched writer can do with a \\"what would have happened if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated\\" exploration (like I was), then this is definitely NOT the book for you. There is a minute fraction (overall) of this, but if you read the first 50 pages (for setup) and the last 50 pages you will have read all it has to offer on that - seriously, that's it. The other 700 pages are not exactly boring, Stephen King is not successful because he writes boring novels, and there is an interesting sub-plot of the psychology and life of Lee Harvey Oswald leading up to the assassination. But other than that, well, it's essentially it devolves into a rather mawkish love story of two lanky high-school teachers set in a small U.S. country town in the early 1960's. Sound like a snooze? Yes. It is. They are brilliant teachers that can bring out the best in nascent adolescent actors, some of whom are rugged footballing athletes, and they have lots of brilliant sex (the teachers, not the athletes, none of that going on) that they call \\"pound cake\\" and, yes, they are very much in love... zzzz. Worse, the small (fictional) country town is supposedly in Texas, close to Dallas (yes, that's right) somewhere near Waco, presumably, but yet is miraculously populated almost exclusively by persons of the the sort of softy, liberal, lefty sensibilities you be hard pressed to find even in modern-day New England, never mind in the 1960's red-neck heartland. Stretches credulity, to put it mildly. This is the first Stephen King book I've finished since \\"The Shining\\". I started \\"Cujo\\" but gave up.I remember why now.
B004DNWPY4|2.0|Having money is not an end, it's a means to an end.  Yes, you can collect more and more money by not spending any, and it's certainly a good idea to avoid borrowing money that you're charged interest for, but the point of having money is not merely to *have* money...it's to be able to *spend* (and yes, sometimes *enjoy*) the money you have.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|The opening of this movie is pretty much impossible to resist: many miles offshore, fishermen drag a man out of the Mediterranean Sea, unconscious and riddled with bullet wounds. There's nothing to identify the stranger, but the doctor on board finds a small microfilm while surgically removing the bullets.<br /><br />When the man regains consciousness, he can't remember who or where he is and what happened to him. His only solid connection to his past is the microfilm, which contains a long string of numbers that sucks him into a whirlwind intrigue of black ops assassinations, government coverups, and corrupt politicians...and he's the epicenter of it all.<br /><br />First, I think they did an awesome job translating the first half of the book into a movie. I think it would've been VERY hard to pare down the entire book into one screenplay, unless the movie was going to be 3 hours long.<br /><br />The premise of this story is just plain fun. Since the beginning of civilization, Man has wondered if he has lived before and if so, why he can't remember. The Bourne Identity takes that ancient mystery and makes a great spy thriller out of it.<br /><br />The plot is structured very well and the pacing is impeccable. It speeds up and slows down in the perfect spots and really builds the tension and mystery as you move through it. It was also intricate enough to follow and make you try to actively figure it out, but not so complex as to overwhelm you with details.<br /><br />The acting is superb across the board. It's hard to imagine someone playing Bourne better than Damon. He completely steals the show.<br /><br />If you're a guy, it's only a matter of time before you wish you were Jason Bourne. He's tough, smart, and incredibly resourceful, but not invincible enough to make you roll your eyes. Although the prime antagonist clashes with Bourne indirectly, through the proxy of other assassins and government agents dispatched to eliminate Bourne, he's capable and intelligent, and makes for a good protagonist vs. antagonist battle.<br /><br />I'd be remiss to not mention the fight scenes, as they are some of the best I've ever seen. The choreography and editing is perfect--you really feel like you're watching highly trained, brutal killers just explode on each other with precision and speed. If you end up skipping back to rewatch them--especially the fight in the apartment--you're not alone. :)<br /><br />If you like a fast-paced, realistic spy mystery/thrillers, then you'll love this movie.

Marie had a little bit of depth, but most of the supporting cast only existed to forward the plot, which was all about Bourne. His plight is so enthralling, however, that you will hardly care.<br /><br />If you like a fast-paced thriller with an intellectual flair to it, then you'll love this book.<br /><br />P.S. The movie was awesome too. They did a great job taking the first half of the book and making a tight, entertaining movie out of it.
0470901071|4.0|I have read this book cover to cover, twice. Chapters on subnetting three times. This book and a good router simulator will give you a good foundation for the CCNA exam. Yes there errors in this book, show me one doesn't have any and I will show you a dead technology. That's what the internet is for. When something didn't work, did the research, learned from it and moved on. I am now a CCNA.

1407130293|5.0|A friend told me how compelling these books were, so I decided to read them for myself.  I was not disappointed.  They grip you right from the start.  The characters are forced to make very tough choices, and you find yourself wanting them to win, but not wanting them to lose themselves in the process.  The books are very enjoyable and entertaining, but don't take the easy way out of the tough situations.<br /><br />Well worth the read!
B006QANR5I|1.0|It would have been nice to see that this DVD would not play on US plyers when I purchsed it!<br /><br />I cannot rate it because it will not play - I want a REFUND!!
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|The newer songs(especially Where The Wild Wind Blows) come across much heavier in a live arena. Bruce's voice live seems to get better with age and the sound quality of the recording is excellent. The set list is from the 2011 tour so of course you're going to have songs included that have been on other live albums, this shouldn't be a concern for any Maiden fan. The energy in the recording can't match what you see in an actual concert (it would be impossible) and I recommend you try to catch a Maiden live show on the 2012 North American tour. A good time will be had by all!!<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!
B003B2H3MC|3.0|Prince Valiant is hokum pure and simple, but it's superior hokum thanks to lavish production values, sterling smooth villainy from James Mason and the odd moment of directorial panache from the undervalued Henry Hathaway. Infamous for Robert Wagner's tragic hairstyle - though if you think his Louis Brooks wig is bad, wait until you see Victor McLaglen's pigtails - the star's athleticism is more impressive than his acting as the exiled Viking prince trying to win his spurs in Camelot, the hand of Janet Leigh's Princess and win back his father's kingdom while he's at it. Sterling Hayden's Sir Gawain may be even more miscast than Wagner but he's clearly enjoying himself far too much for that ever to be a problem, which is pretty much the order of the day here. It may tread a familiar path but it ends up being great fun and exactly what it sets out to be - a colourful comic strip movie in glorious CinemaScope, with all he broad strokes and colourful silliness that implies (the Vikings must have used Texas Longhorns brought back by Leif Ericson for their helmets!), mounted with a big enough budget to enable Hathaway to stage a few big action scenes and throw in a few simple but impressive stunts inbetween while Franz Waxman's vividly exuberant score lifts the picture to another level.<br /><br />Eureka's UK Masters of Cinema Blu-ray is wildly inconsistent: some shots are wonderfully vivid and pin-sharp, others short on detail and subject to colour fluctuation and pulsing, with the grading inconsistently moving from overcast to clear from shot-to-shot in some scenes (most notably the exteriors). This is down in large part to the limitations of the early CinemaScope lenses, which required more light and often lost detail (the lap-dissolves from scene-to-scene show massive deterioration in quality as was commonplace with optical printer work in the 50s and 60s), and partially down to the film not going through any kind of serious restoration, but it's still a massive improvement on the previous DVD issue from Fox themselves, though it's a shame the only extra is the wonderfully over the top trailer pushing the miracle of CinemaScope - `You see it without special glasses' - almost as much as the film itself. Fox's 2.55:1 NTSC DVD releae does a bit better in the extras department with a Movietone newsreel extract, original theatrical trailer and trailers for The Black Swan, A High Wind in Jamaica, Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World and Pirates of Tortuga, but has inferior picture quality.
B0054N73EY|2.0|I am a big fan of RHCP, but this album is the most boring thing I have in my entire collection. Guaranteed: anyone who listens to the entire CD will at the end of it try to remember one thing about it and will come up blank. No great catchy riffs or lyrics or anything, the best thing is pretty much the title of the songs...I think there was a song about some girl named Maggie who did raindances, but I don't quite remember...
B00406UK5A|4.0|Despite being the most overtly commercial of his films, The Descent director Neil Marshal's Centurion ended up doing the worst of any of them. One of that curious post-Gladiator subgenre of films inspired by the legend of the lost Ninth Legion (The Last Legion, The Eagle), it had the misfortune in the UK to open the same day as Agora in a rather limited release to much the same indifference from critics and paying audiences alike before going to cable TV in the US after a brief release on a dozen screens. Which is a pity, because it's a more historically savvy and satisfying film that Alejandro Amenabar's dreary polemic, and also a much more dramatic and entertaining one.<br /><br />Not that it's another I Claudius or especially ambitious: this is a testosterone-driven manly action movie set in a convincingly rendered Roman Britain, a graveyard of ambition where mutual cruelty is the rule in the ongoing stalemate between the stalled invaders and the unyieldingly savage Picts. Yet it sets its gritty adventure in a credible environment and doesn't idealise its characters, limiting itself to the military side of the Empire, its soldiers a convincingly multicultural lot of hard cases. Characterisation is simple at best but effective enough for the film's needs - just enough to differentiate between its dirty half dozen legionaries being hunted down by vengeful Picts after being lured into a massacre while saving most of best writing for Michael Fassbender's occasional narration. Unfortunately Olga Kurylenko lacks the screen presence to really carry off her role as their mute nemesis relentlessly tracking them down: while the character may well be described as being an empty vessel that can only be filled by the blood of her enemies, she probably wasn't intended as quite such a blank slate. It's not a fatal flaw, but a stronger villain could have raised the stakes.<br /><br />As with The Eagle, most of the spectacle is in the film's fist hour but it has a good sense of scale, with a particularly strong use of a harsh landscape that's as much an enemy as the Picts. Where his earlier Scottish-set Dog Soldiers was filmed almost entirely in Luxembourg, this time Marshall filmed on location in Scotland in some impressively inhospitable and grandiose locations with no greenscreen, and it pays dividends. The action scenes are convincingly brutal, making the most of the kind of damage steel does to bone and flesh without getting too silly about it, throwing in the odd memorable moment like a survivor being buried under the mounting number of dead bodies. There are a couple of lapses in logic - surely it would have made more sense for a traitor to have allowed the assassination of the roman governor of Britain than to have gained his trust by saving his life merely to lure a legion into a trap? - though thankfully most of the film's missteps, such as Rachel Stirling's duplicitous governor's wife, have been relegated to the deleted scenes bin of the DVD/Blu-ray. It's best viewed as a decent hard-edged Saturday night adventure film rather than an epic, but despite its almost under the radar theatrical release thanks to Marshal's strong direction and good visual sense it's one that works better than many a bigger budgeted epic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers a good 2.40:1 transfer with audio commentary by Neil Marshall, Simon Bowles, Paul Hyett and Sam McCurdy, 6 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Marshall, outtakes, cast and crew interviews, a 28-minute making of documentary split into four parts, a short HDNet featurette, and production design gallery.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old girl from district 12 who took her<br /> Sister place for the 74th annual Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen<br />Is fighting for survival against many other teenagers from different<br />Districts she won't stop fighting until she gets back home to her<br />Family. She meets loves and hatred.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins the author of The Hunger Games makes her book Suspenseful, clever and interesting by making her characters unique. There are unexpected things happening and it will leave you shocked. In The Hunger Games there is many unexpected things occur and left me very surprised. It's exciting to wonder what is going to happen next. The main characters of this novel are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark they are very complex characters.  Coming from the same Capitol Katniss never knew about Peeta until The Hunger Games. Through out the novel they slowly reveal their true feelings and different layers of their personality, which I found very interesting.<br />There are changes throughout this story that no one can see coming<br />Which is what kept me wanting to keep reading and know more about them.<br />From the beginning of the book Katniss and Peeta showed no interest towards each other. Katniss and Peeta unleash their friendship into star-crossed lovers and makes you predicting and wondering about whether Katniss and Peeta are going to kill each other or help each other and who's going to be the last one to survive.<br /><br />When The Hunger Games began the first day was violent and sad on how different districts kill each other to stay alive. I found The Hunger Games very interesting it everything I like a book to have; suspense, romance, sadness and the satisfaction of worthy risks. Once you start you won't even stop reading the book. Collins uses good imagery through out the novel on how different districts look and the types of weapons they used.<br />Suzanne Collins purpose is for her readers to learn how teenagers risktheir life for so little.

B005F3XV62|3.0|So once in a while you have to sit back and pop in a movie you think is safe for the kids...when suddenly you find yourself laughing and enjoying the movie more than they are. They're at that age when it's just not cool to laugh at something your parents like as well so they stifle their guffaws as much as possible while you smile and laugh out loud. Too bad because they miss out on some fun movies that way. Movies like ZOOKEEPER.<br /><br />The movie opens with Kevin James as Griffin proposing on a sandy beach at sunset while riding a horse to the woman he loves, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Unfortunately unlike most youtube videos, she turns him down explaining how she thought he'd change and leave behind life working in a zoo. She wants someone more upwardly mobile.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years and Griffin is still working in the Franklin Park Zoo. He loves his work and he loves the animals he cares for. While taking care of them all, he pays particular attention to Bernie the gorilla. Bernie has kind of sequestered himself from contact with anyone who comes his way including Griffin who tries his best to cheer him up.<br /><br />Griffin's brother is about to get married and they hold the engagement party at the zoo thanks to Griffin. But as he begins to make a speech about the new couple he notices Stephanie in the background and stumbles on every word out of his mouth. It turns up that Stephanie is back in town and was invited by the bride. Could she and Griffin reunite? As the animals listen in to their conversation it appears a possibility.<br /><br />That night the animals call a meeting and discuss how to make Griffin more attractive to Stephanie and reunite the pair. If not one of the overheard discussions was Griffin talking about leaving and they want him to stay. Somehow they have to unite the pair and at the same time not let Griffin know they can speak. But of course things go wrong and the main animal, Joe the lion (Sylvester Stallone) lets lose scaring Griffin.<br /><br />The animals come together and let Griffin know they can talk now and do their best to school him on how to get Stephanie back. The problem is while their intentions are good the ideas they offer him work more in the animal kingdom than in the land of humans.<br /><br />While all this is going on Griffin helps one of the zoo doctors, Kate (Rosario Dawson). They pair work well together, especially in the case of helping save Janet the lioness (voice of Cher). It was due to Griffin's saving her from choking to death that the animals decided to help.<br /><br />Taking the advice of the animals Griffin does his best to win Stephanie back. But this time around he not only has to convince her he can be the man she longs for but he must also compete with a Neanderthal of a new boyfriend Gale (Joe Rogan). In an attempt to face off against this jerk, Griffin has Kate go with him to the wedding in an attempt to make Stephanie jealous. But something else begins to happen.<br />The film offers a back and forth from the world of Griffin's romance to his love of the animals he cares for. Can he leave behind all that he holds dear in an attempt at love with a woman who wants him to be something else? And what about Kate, is something going on there?<br /><br />The answer is simple if you ever seen a romantic comedy made since say 1925. It's also a staple of the romantic comedy that the main protagonist not realize who he really loves or what he wants to do until the last moments of the film. But knowing this is what will happen or not doesn't matter, it's the journey to that moment that makes this movie such fun.<br /><br />A huge cast of big names offer voice talent here along with the others mentioned. Adam Sandler plays a monkey Judd Apatow an elephant, Donald Faizon and Jon Favreau a pair of bears and more. All of them have some hilarious lines and moments that are a joy to watch, especially Nick Nolte as Bernie the gorilla. The scenes this charactershares with James are a hoot, especially a trip in the outside world to TGIFridays. If you go there you'll be looking for an ape next time.<br /><br />The movie is fairly predictable but it doesn't matter. It has plenty of laughs, a touching story and holds your interest throughout. James does a great job doing plenty of physical comedy and adds a nice touch to the romantic side he offers, especially not appearing as the normal hunk of the month. All in all this movie offers a good time at any price and is actually one worth adding to your collection. Check it out.shares with James are a hoot, especially a trip in the outside world to TGIFridays.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|Growing up in the sixties I was always a fan of the PLANET OF THE APES movies. Not so much the later TV or cartoon series, but the films yes. Not only did it feature some of the best science fiction stories around but also some of the most amazing special effects make up ever seen. The semi-human apes were made plausible by the make up and that gave the movies something to hold on to. So when I heard they were remaking the series I was skeptical to say the least. I shouldn't have been.<br /><br />Rather than begin this film with the landing of a spacecraft we begin in the near future. Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist working for a major drug company searching for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Testing on animals and in particular chimpanzees, he thinks he's found a cure, a drug that has helped the brain recreate cells. This has led to increased mental activity in the apes and shown them to think more. When he goes to demonstrate before the board of directors, his star subject goes mad and attacks everyone from her handlers to the staff at the research center. They are forced to kill her and the project is put on hold.<br /><br />Unknown to Will and her handlers at the time, the ape was merely protecting the baby she gave birth to beforehand. Ordered to destroy all of the test subjects, will secrets this one away and names him Caesar, raising him at home. Caesar is smarter than most apes having had the formula Will developed in his bloodstream via his mother since birth. Will also illegally uses this formula on his father (John Lithgow) who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, with remarkable success.<br /><br />Will and Caesar continue to grow together. Will carries on his experiments and research hoping that the drug he's found will be the answer. Caesar continues to expand his mental abilities and ability to converse via sign language with will and later with Will's girlfriend Caroline (Freida Pinto), a veterinarian. Will takes Caesar on occasional outings to a local national forest but never lets him run free on his own without his being there.<br /><br />The drug Will developed doesn't have long term success though. As Will's father begins to lose his mental abilities several years down the road (and as Caesar has grown), he accidentally wrecks a neighbor's car and while being shoved by him, Caesar escapes the house and attacks the man to defend Lithgow. Animal control is called in and Caesar is locked up that appears fine. But unknown to Will the center is run by men who just want a paycheck and who taunt and torture the monkeys being held.<br /><br />While Will tries to go the legal route and get Caesar back at the same time the drug company is expanding his research and hoping to go public, Caesar becomes resentful of being caged and treated as an animal by his jailers. Using his intelligence and escaping, Caesar goes home and steals several canisters of the now aerosol drug, releasing it among his fellow captive apes. Soon they escape and set out to rectify the treatment they have received at the hands of man.<br /><br />This new take on how the apes evolved replaces the time travel questions raised in the original films but still has several loopholes in logic. But not enough that you can't enjoy the film or marvel at the story being told.<br /><br />Best of all the film features some of the most amazing special effects ever seen. Using motion capture technology you will actually believe you are seeing an ape perform rather than a man in a suit. But there actually IS no man in a suit at all, just computer generated motion captured images on screen. Caesar shows emotions on his face and body language that make you feel for him, care for him. It's an amazing piece of technology that brings not just the film but the character to life. By the end of the film you find yourself rooting for the apes!<br /><br />RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES doesn't just tell a science fiction story. It tells a human story as well, ofmistreatment of animals and how humans are tossed aside as well. It takes on the question of animal testing without being preachy or slamming one side or the other as well. But most of all it tells a solid story from beginning to end and entertains in the process. This is not just a movie that you will want to see but you will want to see more than once. It should definitely be added to any film fans collection.mistreatment of animals and how humans are tossed aside as well.

B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|I love action films. I've always been a sucker for those movies that featured larger than life heroes taking on all odds to beat the bad guys. When those movies changed to feature heroes that were not always quite pure I still loved seeing them. When THE EXPENDABLES was released featuring not one but a number of action heroes on screen together I thought it was fantastic. This hadn't been done since the sixties when films like THE GREAT ESCAPE or THE DIRTY DOZEN were made.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie it tells the story of Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), the leader of a crew of for hire mercenaries that take on almost any job. The film opens with them rescuing a group of people taken hostage by pirates. Barney and his crew offer them the option to leave peacefully once and when they refuse they are all taken out with \\"extreme prejudice\\", graphically so. But when one of his team goes too far, even Barney sets him aside and refuses to use him on their next mission until he cleans himself up mentally.<br /><br />Getting that next mission is fun in itself. Barney meets with a mysterious stranger played by Bruce Willis in a church. Willis has also called in someone else to offer them the job played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Seeing these three icons of action films on the screen at the same time is a rare treat. Arnold turns the job down but Ross decides to recon the situation and see if it's possible to achieve.<br /><br />Taking his right hand man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) with him, they scope out the small South American island that's run by a small time dictator being propped up by an ex-CIA agent (Eric Roberts) whose using the people and the island for his drug operation. The people on the island, led by the dictator's daughter Sandra, are hoping to revolt. Ross figures out that his contractor is probably CIA and wants to control the island for the company. But something about the woman's resolve to stay on the island and try to make it better touches him. He and Christmas escape from the island after nearly being caught and he makes the decision to take on the job.<br /><br />The team of the Expendables includes Toll Road (Randy Coutre), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Yin Yang (Jet Li) along with Ross and Christmas. Each has their own specialty in fighting technique and all will come in handy as they face off against Roberts men on the island which include WWE star Stone Cold Steve Austin and martial arts star Gary Daniels. These include some of the best fight scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />The movie is filled with explosions, fight scenes and heroic turns of events that make these mercs more human than most that shows a caring side to them as well as the hire for money side. You also witness a camaraderie and loyalty among the group that is rare in films these days. But most of all you have one of the best most high octane action films made in years.<br /><br />Having been a while since I saw the film originally I wasn't sure at first what made this extended cut different. In retrospect I realized that there was more background and involvement with the entire crew, including part time member Mickey Rourke, than there was in the original release. This fills out the team better than at first and makes them more interesting as well.<br /><br />Work on the sequel has already begun and more testosterone has been added by including both Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme as well. The only action hero that seems to be missing is Steven Segal and Danny Trejo but maybe they'll be around for a third film, who knows?es him.

B0055V6EZE|3.0|Being a Hugh Laurie fan and knowing of his considerable talent, I looked forward to hearing this CD.  Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing.  It is wonderful that Mr. Laurie pursued his obvious love of the blues, and his musical ability comes through.  And the second song, You Don't Know My Mind, is just wonderful.  The CD would have been better had someone advised Mr. Laurie to sing less or at least sing in a more nuanced way. His fingers might express the soul of the blues, but his voice surely does not.<br />In any event, he must have had a wonderful time doing this.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I know it's been out for a while now but the fact is I didn't have the chance to see the film THE BLIND SIDE until this past weekend. All I can say to those who are following in my footsteps on this movie, you'll regret waiting once you have the chance. This movie far outweighed THE HURT LOCKER when it comes to what should have won for Best Picture at this year's Oscars. Understandable, though, as the film features no political motivation which seems to be how you win any more.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen it, the film is the true life story of football star Michael Oher and how a series of fortunate events led him from what could have been the most miserable of lives to one of fame and fortune. But more important than those qualities is that Oher was led by some unseen force to find a family and a home.<br /><br />Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a young black man, big for his age, who gets a chance to go to a private school with the hope of playing sports. Unfortunately his grades disqualify him from participating. With low test levels and a low level learning ability, it seems as if Michael isn't long destined for this school. Few of the kids take an interest in being friendly to him with the exception of young S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head).<br /><br />One cold and rainy day after being picked up from school, S.J.'s mother Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) watches as Michael walks in the rain. When asked where he is heading, he says the gym because it's warm there. Realizing the boy has no home, Leigh Anne invites him to stay the night at their house.<br /><br />A one night invitation turns into a long term situation as Leigh Anne decides to take on the responsibility of helping this young man. Husband Sean (Tim McGraw), daughter Collin (Lily Collins) and S.J. all welcome Michael into their home. Leigh Anne takes Michael shopping for clothes and helps him with studies as well. The teachers at the school help too as they realize Michael isn't stupid, he's just never been in a learning environment that encouraged him to study. Michael's life begins to change immediately.<br /><br />The help of the teachers and Leigh Anne pays off when Michael's grades raise enough for him to join the football team. But this huge player isn't what the coach expected as he tends to be non-aggressive on the field. Recognizing the coach just doesn't understand how to reach Michael, Leigh Anne walks onto the practice field and tells Michael that the team is his family and that since he has said he'd do anything to protect his family, he should apply that to the field. In so doing, he becomes the lynch pin to the success of the team.<br /><br />A twist in fate appears towards the end of the film as Michael's decision to go to Ole Miss for college is questioned by the NCAA. They feel that perhaps the entire incident of Michael's mentoring and guardianship by the Tuohys was nothing more than their using him to help their alma mater. The answer as to the truth in this can only be found within Michael's heart.<br /><br />The success Oher was able to sustain thanks to the help of one woman who made the decision to see to it that a human being wasn't just dumped one more time is what makes up the center of this film.  The football, the fact that Michael Oher is black, the rise in education and status are all planets that circle the sun here.  And that sun is the story of a person who was willing to ignore mindless comments, ignorant claims and the world around her in an attempt to simply help someone get a step up.<br /><br />Some have claimed that this is just another example of white people helping out blacks in an attempt to make themselves feel better. They miss the point of the film entirely. That's because while Bullock may be the star, the real story isn't about Leigh Anne Tuohy. The real story is about Michael Oher and his taking hold of the opportunity provided to him and making the best of his life.<br /><br />Rare today is it that we are presented with a film that contains as much heart as this one does. Even God is given a center piece in the film as it takes place at a Christian school. Too often films are mired in the nasty sides of life, the worst the world has to offer. Even in the scenes in this film that involve Michael's old neighborhood we get the chance to see him rise above and move forward.<br /><br />This movie offers all you could ask for. It offers plenty of laughs at the oddest of times. It offers portions that will touch your heart and bring a tear to your eye. But more than anything it offers you heart and the possibility of a bright future for anyone.

B005BDZN62|4.0|It hardly seems possible that the movie WEST SIDE STORY is actually 50 years old. When you read those words the first thing that pops into mind is...am I really that old? The answer is yes and would be far better if I thought I had survived as well as this film.<br /><br />For the few who aren't aware (or for the younger generation that seems to think the only movies made were those since they were born) here is the gist of the story in this film. Think Romeo and Juliet transported to the 50s gang era in New York. Then again if you don't know movies from 50 years ago who's to say you know Romeo and Juliet?<br /><br />Gangs seemed to spring up everywhere in the 50s media. They were feared by the establishment and hailed by teens. The teen gangs became to subject of numerous investigations and arrests and then spawned a number of films. The first to treat them a little different was WEST SIDE STORY.<br /><br />The Jets are the premier gang in their neighborhood. But with the influx of Puerto Rican's moving in the rival gang the Sharks are poised to take over. A confrontation is inevitable; it's just a matter of when. Leading the Jets is Riff (Russ Tamblyn) who views his turf as a home for the gang bereft of a regular family. The Jest ARE their family. And no one is going to take away their \\"home\\",<br /><br />In charge of the Sharks is Bernardo (George Charkiris). While many Puerto Rican immigrants view America as an opportunity, Bernardo just sees the degradation and put downs for his people, including his sister Maria (Natalie Wood). And the Jets treatment of Bernardo and his friends is just the culmination of how he views the world in America.<br /><br />Both gangs are ready to explode and the final straw happens at the high school dance. Along with the Jets is ex-member Tony (Richard Beymer) who wants to move on with his life working and away from the gangs. He sees the downfall it leads to. With Bernardo comes Maria to her first dance. The two see one another and its love at first sight. But Bernardo steps in between them.<br /><br />The two love birds still find a way to see one another and share their hopes and dreams of finding a world where they can be themselves and not worry about others. At the same time the Jets and Sharks have a war council and are planning a rumble to fight one another.<br /><br />During the fight Riff is killed by Bernardo, Bernardo by Tony and suddenly the advice everyone has to offer the two lovers nearly wrecks their chances at happiness. Can they make it out of their world of hate? Can two people from two different backgrounds work through their differences and resolve their problems? Those are just some of the themes at work here.<br /><br />So now that you have the story you might wonder what makes this one so special. Perhaps I failed to mention that this isn't just a movie but a musical. Yes here we have a group of tough teens dancing and leaping and singing about how much they love their gangs. Unusual? Sure but it works and works well.<br /><br />Initially this story ran on Broadway but never to huge box office success. The movie changed all of that. It did big at the box office and even won the Oscar for best picture, best director (Robert Wise), supporting actor (Chakiris), supporting actress (Rita Moreno as Bernardo's girlfriend), cinematography and more. When that happened the play became a world wide sensation as well.<br /><br />But back to the movie. It has been called one of the greatest movie musicals of all times. It has been hailed as the best of the best. But while it is good, I've never quite found it to be among my most favorite. There are sequences that will stick with me forever when it comes to film history and my own enjoyment (the entire sequence of the song \\"Cool\\" is amazing to this day and I love the song \\"When You're A Jet\\") but on the whole I was never quite in love with the movie.<br /><br />That being said, the new blu-ray transfer of the film is amazing. This film is being seen as it should be, in glorious color with a transfer and restoration from what was previously available done right. It is one of the best examples of why film restoration is something people should take seriously and consider. Many of the films from our past, from when we were growing up, are deteriorating in cans around the world. One day those movies may be gone and forgotten but not if they can be saved.<br /><br />The movie seen here is better than a number of films released since. The dance numbers, choreographed by the late great Jerome Robbins is fantastic. It's a combination of ballet, jazz dance and improv that combines to become something unique. Robbins was in on this play from the start and co-directed with Wise. Their work together here is remarkable.<br /><br />The music sticks with you in some songs and falls into the memory bank with others. If you don't walk away with at least one in your head for days, one that you find yourself humming later in the week, I would be surprised. That's something to be said for a movie that's 50 years old. And the quality of this production and restoration is something to treasure as much as the songs offered.

If you've never seen WEST SIDE STORY you now have a chance. Not just any chance, but one that offers it in the best possible way ever.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Update: 5 stars for certain sure.<br /><br />Great app, love it, use it all the time. Had to download again due to phone problem, and looked more closely at the Permissions. Had some major questions, so wrote the developer.  Got an almost instant and fully informative response that answered all my questions. See below. Huge kudos for the quality of their customer service/support and major props for the neat app. Good job, Angle Labs.<br /><br />Here are the answers to my permissions questions:<br /><br />.........<br /><br />(From Angle Labs)<br />As for permissions, here's a brief explanation:<br /><br />The alarm needs to read the phone state so Alarm Clock Xtreme can change its behavior during a phone call. The application allows you to choose a quiet alarm, vibrating alarm, or silent alarm during a phone call so if the alarm goes off while you're in a call you are not startled with your music choice blasting into your ear.<br /><br />We don't use your phone state information for any other reason.<br /><br />As for keylock, some folks want their alarms to unlock their phones when the alarm sounds, so that they can readily press snooze or solve math problems.<br /><br />The global system settings is so that alarms will sound in Android OS.<br /><br />You can check out our privacy policy, as well as a longer explanation for what permissions Alarm Clock Xtreme requires here:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Please let us know if this answers your questions.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Angle Labs<br /><br />------------------<br />(Earlier I wrote:)<br /><br />First I gave a very positive review. Now I've paid closer attention to the requested permissions, and one of them is to read phone state. I cannot imagine a legitimate use for that, and have written the developer to inquire. If I don't get a satisfactory answer, I will uninstall it. I'm just learning to watch the permissions very closely, to inquire when they don't seem consistent with the nature of the app, and torefuse the app accordingly.<br /><br />I still love the app, but I want to know first about the phone state, also why it needs to modify my system settings and why it wants permission to disable my keylock. So buyer beware, I guess. If these things don't bother you, it's still a great app. But since they almost certainly do not need to read my phone logs and contacts and have precise information on all my calls, I would sure warn against buying it.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|It seems these days that young people tend to ignore history or to relate to it only in the amount of time they've had on Earth. Anything beyond that is unimportant to them. At the same time they tend to focus more on social and media material than on things as simple as books, limiting themselves to the intake of knowledge. With the release of THE HELP, one can only hope that it inspires them to look deeper, to find out the real story of what happened with the civil rights questions of the sixties.<br /><br />Set in the early sixties in Jackson, Mississippi, the story revolves around the black maids of this racially segregated town. These are the days when separate entrances and water fountains were considered normal. And while they are called on to use separate areas, the maids are considered good enough to basically raise white children and take care of white houses.<br /><br />The main character in question is Aibileen (Viola Davis), a maid who works for a respectable family, taking care of their child Mae Mobley and teaching and taking care of her as well as cooking and cleaning the house. The friction in her world has been buried beneath years of racial prejudice but comes to a head when the leader of the Junior League, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) tells the girls in the club everyone should have a separate bathroom for their hired help because they carry germs. She's so convinced she's written an initiative and sent it to the governor in hopes that it can be turned into a law.<br /><br />Aibileen knows she can not react but it doesn't set well with her either. Neither does it set well with Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan (Emma Stone). Just back from college and hoping to find a job as a writer, Skeeter has just taken a job as a writer taking on letters concerning cleaning which she knows nothing about. Seeking advice and help, she turns to Aibileen who knows all sorts of cleaning secrets. When Hilly makes her bathroom initiative know, Skeeter doesn't think much of it and pushes back mentioning it in the Junior League's newsletter indefinitely.<br /><br />As Skeeter and Aibileen get to know one another, Skeeter asks her if she'd be interested in talking to her about what its like to be a maid in Mississippi, what it's like to raise white people's children only to see them grow and become more like their parents. While she turns her down at first, eventually Aibileen realizes that she needs to find the courage it takes to let the truth be known. Once she does, the two begin putting together the book that will become known as THE HELP.<br /><br />Skeeter does have an ulterior motive but she's up front with Aibileen from the start. Skeeter wants to be a serious writer and a publisher in New York would be interested in the stories she's seeking. As they progress she finds that the publisher wants more than just one or two maid's tales, they need more. Aibileen first recruits her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer), a brash and at times abrasive maid who's having problems finding new employment as Hilly has recently fired her. Eventually due to other circumstances more maids join in.<br /><br />But this is just the story of the maids that is the main focus. What also comes into play here is the story of Hilly and her controlling nature as well as her racist attitudes. Hilly rules the Junior League with an iron fist and the girls that belong follow her lead to the letter. This is the social atmosphere of Jackson at this time, a world where social stature is the most important thing. All women desire to be added to their midst and fear being shunned by the League and Hilly. But Hilly's actions eventually have consequences.<br /><br />The story reveals itself as the world is changing. Medgar Evers is shot at one point and JFK's funeral is mentioned. Not only do these items bring the historical aspect of the time into play but they set the tone for what the world was like during this period. This is the most important thing thatyoung people can gain from watching this. My guess is none of them would believe that anyone could be so backwards as is seen here but it did happen.<br /><br />The revelations of the stories the maids have to tell and how they are treated by their white employers brings the tale of racism to a personal level, especially those of Aibileen and Minny. And Skeeter, who was raised in this atmosphere, has her eyes opened as well as each story is told to her. It's as if she's seeing the world around her for the first time.<br /><br />THE HELP is not a movie that will give details and specific incidents to young people who see it concerning the civil rights movement. But as I stated earlier, it will be a nice jumping on point for them to begin looking into it. Many would be stunned to learn that there are still areas of the country that continue on this way.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is that it's not a slap in the face. It's not an attack that paints one group as superior to the other or sets one race against another. Instead it uses Hilly to represent that vocal minority that leads others by the nose and forces them to do these things they know they shouldn't, sitting back and accepting things as they are in the hopes of being part of the in crowd. It uses Skeeter to represent the people who have stood by silent but are waking up to the realities around them. And it uses Aibileen and Minny to represent those who have been oppressed and have hope for a different future.  This is a movie that needs to be seen by youngsters who don't know what it was like. Perhaps in so doing they can realize that change was needed and needs to carry on.young people can gain from watching this.

B006MGC3VK|5.0|If you're a fan of melodic rock that leans ever so slightly towards the prog-metal camp, you simply can't go wrong with this disc. Loved it on first listen and am sure it will be something I go back to frequently & fondly. It may not be quite as heavy as some of their earlier stuff but it is no less engaging/entertaining...And this is the first time I've heard any OSI that reminded me of KM's other band, Chroma Key. But that isn't a negative in any way since I'm a huge fan of everything he has done under that name...even the mostly instrumental Graveyard Mountain Home. Buy this one without reservation.
B005OOSPZO|3.0|For years Hollywood has made movies that boosted morale rather than portrayed the truth (more or less) of what happened during historical events. Recently TV series have taken to correcting that but perhaps gone overboard. So where, other than through diligent research, can one find out information about these events? Sorry but that is the only way. But on occasion film makers do attempt to give you as much truth as possible. TORA TORA TORA is one of those films.<br /><br />The movie recreates not just the day that Pearl Harbor was attacked but the events that led up to it days prior. It also presents the events from both sides of the Pacific, what the Japanese were thinking and planning and how the U.S. bumbled things with its bureaucratic red tape. Could things have played out differently? According to this film, yes.<br /><br />The film shows a peacetime Pacific where preparations were being made on the chance the Japanese might start something. New island commander Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) does things his way. His biggest concern at the time was sabotage and spies on the island. This led to numerous errors on his part that involved things like placing the planes close together so they could be watched easier instead of further apart where they could take off if the island was attacked. No one believed that could happen.<br /><br />Adm. Husband Kimmel (Martin Balsam) does his best to stay on top of things but communications between the island and the mainland were not top priority it seems. Messages he sends along to the mainland are passed from hand to hand without priority. The same is true of information passed along from office to office in Washington. A note of a decrypted message between the Japanese would have given those on the island ample time to prepare for the attack. It sat in a going out tray at a telegraph office because the military communication system was down at the time.<br /><br />The Japanese were no better off. While the military command was all ready to go to war, they were being blocked by government officials on their end. These same officials bungled their own jobs as well. The biggest example is when the ambassador in Washington is supposed to deliver a declaration of war to the U.S. at a predetermined time. It doesn't happen because the typist is taking too long to type the declaration and then their meeting gets pushed back. Had it happened on schedule the sneak part of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor wouldn't have happened.<br /><br />The movie focuses on many of these points but to simply have bureaucrats walk down hallways and pass messages along would result in one boring film. It moves back and forth between the planning on the side of the Japanese and the red tape functions of the military on our side. But the film makers spared little expense when it came to depicting the attack. A combination of archive footage, models, miniatures and more were used to recreate the devastation of that day and you feel pure terror along with those onboard the ships that sank. It never lingers on gruesomeness but does make you realize what happened that day.<br /><br />The movie has just been released in blu-ray format and the picture offered is clean, sharp and well done. Extras include looking back at what it took to make this film behind the scenes and historical pieces as well.<br /><br />Made during the last days of the Vietnam War and during when anti-war protests were the rage, it was a bold thing for a studio to do in 1970. But the movie doesn't encourage or defend war; it just shows what happened on that day in 1941. Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, this one doesn't focus on fictional characters to present what happened but instead focuses on the story of Pearl Harbor itself. And with a generation of children growing up who have no idea what it meant, this is a movie that they should make a point of viewing.itary command was all ready to go to war, they were being blocked by government officials on their end.

B006JD48NM|5.0|I have to admit having little knowledge of AS.  I am a big fan of Jim Clark and several modern drivers like Alonso.  But this was a fascinating look at the world of F1 drivers as it existed at that time, the last of an era of death defying racing, and the arrogance of FIA (and Bernie) as it exists even today.  The in-car sounds and views are outstanding, hair raising.  The candid shots and interviews are even more remarkable.  It's great sadness to see such talent blunted by the world's bureaucracy, true in all art and sports.  I hope Ayrton is looking down with greatest pride in the fact that there have been no deaths in F1 since his.  A truly remarkable, enjoyable and fascinating movie.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) is an American journalist with a new newsmagazine that finds herself involved in a story that connects to her present day life and husband's family. The story moves comfortably back and forth between the past and present as it unfolds telling a dramatic and tragic story.<br /><br />Sarah Starzynski was a young French Jew during WWII. As the Jews in Paris are being rounded up, she tells her brother to hide in the secret closet and not to let anyone know he is there, locking the door behind her. What she doesn't realize is that this is not a few hours away trip but a transport of Jews to the camps. Unable to leave to release her brother, she searches for a way out.<br /><br />Relocated to a velodrome with no bathrooms and horror inducing conditions, the family is finally taken to trains and unable to rescue their son. But Sarah never gives up hope, holding tightly to the key in her possession.<br /><br />Each step of her trip is followed by Julia in the present as she searches for answers of what happened to the young girl. It becomes even more personal when she finds that the new building she and her husband are renovating is one that's been owned by the family since as far back as the war. Could they have known what became of the boy? Or of Sarah? Julia continues to search for answers, feeling a connection by being in the same apartment.<br /><br />The story follows Sarah as she and her family are separated in the camps. Few people realize that the Germans were not the only ones to have taken unkindly to the Jews during the war. In an attempt to placate the Germans, many French involved themselves in these roundups as well. It is only in recent years their involvement has been made more public.<br /><br />In the camp Sarah continues to hold on to hope (and her key) that her brother is still out there and safe. If only she could reach him. With nothing to lose, she plans an escape and a way back to Paris. This would be an incredible task for anyone but even more so for Sarah who is only around 10 years old.<br /><br />Julia continues to learn more about the apartment and about Sarah. And the more she learns the more she yearns to know what happened. Things between her and her husband become strained. She questions his family about what they knew. And by the end of the film we too will learn what became of Sarah and her brother.<br /><br />While the movie is about a horrifying experience and piece of history, it never plays it for the cheap thrill. The suicide of one woman in the velodrome is the worst it gets, but you know what's going to happen to these people. The interweaving of the two stories is well handled and the acting makes you feel that these people are truly going through the ordeals they find themselves in past and present.<br /><br />SARAH'S KEY is a timely story, especially when one witnesses the anti-Semitic remarks hurled during the latest Occupy Wall Street protests. It is a lesson we should have learned by now but apparently haven't. And perhaps that makes this movie one that should be seen today. A touching drama, a superb story and well made film that is worth the rental price.le task for anyone but even more so for Sarah who is only around 10 years old.<br /><br />Julia continues to learn more about the apartment and about Sarah.

B007JRU2UK|1.0|I don't understand why this movie got so much hype.  The characters are all despicable people, the wife cheats (not a spoiler), the daughters are brats and the part about the land is irrelevant.  There are no really good shots of how beautiful Hawaii really is and the history they want to preserve is poorly shown.  Everything in this movie is horrible.  It was horribly written and I hope for \\"my generation\\" of writers that this crap doesn't set a new [low] standard seen as the new high standard.  I went to see this in theaters with my mom and god mother and they sat there at the end and laughed so hard they cried.  Not because it was a good ending.  Not because it was funny.  But because it was so terrible and we spent $30 between the 3 of us to WATCH it and we didn't walk out (although we all admitted thinking about it several times and asking for our money back).  If I met the screen writers I would tell them they need to quit their day jobs.  It isn't that I don't love an amazingly well written bad person or person with a bad character trait or they do something that isn't terribly nice, but these characters weren't well written.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  And proof that people pay off reviewers (of newspapers and magazines; not Amazon) or people pay for the brand.  Sorry Clooney, you sucked.  Pure and Simple.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Last year at the film festival in Cannes, all the talk seemed to be about Terrence Malick's new film THE TREE OF LIFE. In part this was due to the critics taking note of the movie and reviews ranged from one end of the scale to the other. But no one wanted to miss it. Perhaps that's because Malick is something different in Hollywood.<br /><br />Since 1973 Malick has only released 5 films as a director and almost all of them have been critically acclaimed if not a huge financial success. And yet he continues to direct films and find studios to back him. Where some films that claim to be \\"art films\\" never deserve the attention they receive, Malick's films are more often than not something to witness. They are a visual and storytelling treat. Those films have included BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE, THE NEW WORLD and now THE TREE OF LIFE. I usually find myself appreciating films like these but rarely enjoy them enough to watch again. This film changes that.<br /><br />The story begins with the death of a brother to Jack (Sean Penn). Its effect on him isn't quite visible. Surely he is shaken but it makes him think back to other things, other days and growing up in the 1950s.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays Mr. O'Brien, Jack's father. Pitt's character is a strict disciplinarian but not without reason. He wants his children to grow up and be successful. This becomes even more important later in the film when he is forced to take on a different job. He feels its better to be your own boss than to work at the whim of someone else. His battles with life, his struggles, are imposed upon his three sons, especially Jack.<br /><br />Jack's mother is the opposite of his father, a free spirit who sees joy in the world around her, who offers her children a sense of freedom in simply playing. Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is a tender woman who loves her husband and her children with equal measure, but who wants her boys to experience life as opposed to just making a living and not experiencing things as simple as sunsets.<br /><br />One would think that these two differing people would be hard pressed to find common ground. But the fact is that they are the yin and yang of these boys lives, the balance between reality and fantasy that should exist to make a person complete, to make them whole. And as the life Jack remembers fills the screen we see the three brothers in various forms through his eyes; his love of his brothers and at times his jealousy of them. We witness his admiration for his father but his fear of him as well. And we see his love for his mother that comes through at all times.<br /><br />This is a coming of age story that shows a young boy grow up to be a man but without a major plot issue that makes it happen. It's not like someone dies or does drugs but a simple story of a boy. You recognize so much of what Jack goes through and experiences if you grew up during this time period or even the one after. Fireflies, bb guns and tying frogs to model rockets are just some of the crazy things kids do or did. And Jack and his brothers do it all.<br /><br />But Malick wasn't content to leave it at that. We also have the story of Pitt's character, a man who struggles to do his best and yet considers himself a failure. In reality he hasn't failed he's just placed in a position where he can't achieve the goals he's set for himself. That day might come, but not as this story takes place. He is a man with wealth in the love of his wife and children who feels he is poor. And it is through his disappointment in himself that we see the bad side of family.<br /><br />Malick is amazing in the images he turns up on film. What for most would be a humdrum neighborhood with little to see, Malick turns it into a feast for the eyes. You can almost feel the warm summer days when kids would play or do yard work here. And a sunset is rarely captured so brilliantly on film.<br /><br />Added to this is a sequence that involves the creation ofthe world. It's an amazing thing to watch that would fit home in Epcot let alone in any film concerning the beginnings of life. The effects used and the footage that comes out is breathtakingly beautiful.<br /><br />At just over 2 hours the movie may seem a tad long for some. While I watched though it passed the personal test I have for all movies: when it's really bad and if it moves to slow I just hang tight to the remote and move past the slow parts. Sorry but that's the truth. I never once felt the need to do so here.<br /><br />THE TREE OF LIFE is a fantastic movie. It's one that I will keep on hand because I know I'll want to experience it again, finding new things to witness with each viewing. It's a movie that I think anyone with children will enjoy. And it's a treat for the eyes, the ears and the mind. In short, this is a great movie and deserving of all the credit and hype that surrounded its initial release. It deserves better than the short time it was on screens and needs to be discovered. With its release on DVD, now is the chance.the world.

B0051T47NQ|4.0|There have been a ton of movies released since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT that have supposedly been \\"lost film\\" movies. These are movies that present a story using hand held camera footage that was supposed to have been lost but then rediscovered and can now be shown to the public. Some work (like THE LAST EXORCISM) and others don't (too many). TROLL HUNTER works and works well.<br /><br />This Norwegian film begins with a group of students shooting a film that's supposed to be about poachers and hunters killing bears in the nearby forest. The problem is that once they arrive and see the bear that's been killed, they know this wasn't normal nor was it done by hunters. Seeing a man off to himself, they begin to follow him. Rumor has it that he is a troll hunter, those fabled creatures found in fairy tales.<br /><br />The group follows him around and pesters him until he finally allows them to go with him in his travels. He drops hints to them that there are indeed trolls roaming the various forests but that the government does all it can to keep this fact unknown to the world. Of course the kids think he's full of it but play along thinking they can get an interesting movie out of it. They get more than they bargained for.<br /><br />One night after he leaves them behind to set a series of troll traps, he suddenly comes back and tells them to sit still and be quiet. He continues to ask them if any of them are Christians to which they always respond no. It seems that trolls have an aversion to Christians and can smell them out.<br /><br />As the group sits and jokes, oblivious to his warnings to be quiet, they see something shaking the trees in the distance. Soon they can see what it is when they come face to face with a giant troll breaking through the branches. Running for their lives with the troll in pursuit, it is the troll hunter who rescues them when they reach his vehicle, equipped with lights that freeze the troll until morning when the sunlight turns him to stone.<br /><br />Here is where the film changes, becoming a quest for the group to document the reality that trolls do indeed exist and the cover up being initiated by the government to keep people unaware. It seems that the trolls have been given a substantial piece of land where they are to remain but recently have begun to cross over. One can only imagine if an army of these giants were to cross their border. Only the troll hunter keeps them in line.<br /><br />This movie works on so many levels. As a \\"lost footage\\" true story film that turns once we glimpse the trolls (not that I would believe in them to being with). When the trolls make an appearance we find ourselves in another world where fairy tale creatures exist and few can hold them back. Rather than a movie about someone whose mind is lost that believes in trolls, we find ourselves believing as well.<br /><br />The acting involved (don't expect names because I'm nearly certain no one would recognize them anyway) is well played with each actor making us believe they are this group of youngsters who find themselves in way over their heads. And the actor portraying the grizzled troll hunter does a remarkable job as the worn out man who must see to it they're contained.<br /><br />The special effects are remarkable with stony giants come to life on the big screen. These aren't the lumbering creatures that perhaps a Harryhausen might have made 40 years ago, these are fast moving creations that would rush after you with little hope of escape.<br /><br />The movie is vastly entertaining, taking its time to unwind and allow the story to unfold. Its not the normal jump into the creature 5 minutes into the film. We get to know the characters first, to witness their motivations and beliefs before we get to the trolls. But once we do it's a non-stop ride of imagination and combination of fear and fun you will enjoy.ne.<br /><br />Here is where the film changes, becoming a quest for the group to document the reality that trolls do indeed exist and the cover up being initiated by the government to keep people unaware.

But once we do it's a non-stop ride of imagination and combination of fear and fun you will enjoy.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I loved this book. The whole time, I kept thinking \\"Finally, someone gets it, someone is writing all the things I've been saying to myself for years!\\"<br /><br />The corporate and academic worlds usually cater (too much, in my opinion) to extroverts - and so much of what I ready here really resonates with me. Big mouths who don't have any ideas often get shoved to the front of leadership roles. For those of us who don't crave the spotlight, there's a way for us to get ahead and work with those who are more outgoing and outspoken.<br /><br />But even more important than that, it gives us some insight on what we can do to work with (I don't want to say tolerate) extroverts or push ourselves out of our comfort zones. It reminds us that replenishing our need for peace and quiet before and/or after is essential. I'll be referring to it a lot going forward.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Comic fans were thrilled to death when they heard that the X-Men comics they had loved for years were going to hit the motion picture screen. That movie and it's two sequels pleased most but not all of the fans and brought new people into the world of the X-Men who had never heard of them. By the time the third film came out, fans were slowly dwindling away. It was time to start the franchise up with something fresh, something new. And that happens with X-MEN: FIRST CLASS.<br /><br />It may be new but its old as well, deciding to go into the past of the X-Men instead of the present or future. This time around we see the beginnings of the X-Men, how Magneto and Charles Xavier started out as friends and then took to opposite sides of their life long battle to gain acceptance of mutants, one through peaceful means the other through force.<br /><br />We witness the two as children when the film opens, one held in a concentration camp, the other in a mansion. Erik Lensherr's (later Magneto) magnetic abilities are noticed and brought to the attention of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who kills his mother to force Erik to let his abilities flow. A tragic mistake on Shaw's part as this sets in motion a years long search by Erik to find him and take his life.<br /><br />Xavier on the other hand lives in the lap of luxury. He discovers someone in his home one night only to find his mother in the kitchen. A few questions later and its revealed this is not his mother but a shape shifting mutant known as Raven whom Xavier's family adopts.<br /><br />Years later the world is a different place. It's the sixties and the cold war is in full bloom. CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) is trying to find evidence that Shaw is involved with the Russians in a plot to overthrow the world. Her search yields the discovery that mutants are being employed by Shaw and she seeks out an expert on mutants to understand the possible problems, a newly appointed Professor named Xavier (James McAvoy).<br /><br />The CIA isn't convinced that mutants exist or that they can be trusted with the exception of one known as the man in black (Oliver Platt). He takes Charles, Raven and Moira to a secret base he's established. With the help of fellow mutant and scientific genius Hank McCoy and an enhancer he's made to assist Xavier with his psychic abilities, they begin tracking down a group of other mutants to form a team that will face the challenges of Shaw.<br /><br />Included in this group is Erik (Michael Fassbender), now trying to track down Shaw as an adult. He nearly finds him but once again Shaw evades him. With the help of Xavier's group, he now has a chance. He joins and he and Xavier strike up a friendship but with opposing views as to how the world perceives mutants.<br /><br />Shaw puts things in motion, manipulating the Russians and the Americans. His movements result in the Bay of Pigs face off. Can he begin a world war that will leave mutants alone remaining? Or will Charles Xavier and his X-Men put an end to his madness?<br /><br />The film does a wonderful job on so many levels. For one, rather than continue the story from the previous films, it takes us back to the beginning where we witness how this team came to be. It also presents us with the back story of why Magneto and Charles both view the world from separate sets of eyes. Both have a point but they're methods of dealing with the world are completely different.<br /><br />The film also presents a great way to learn the lesson of acceptance and of bigotry, the basis for the whole series of comics when it began. The metaphor in use then was of a world that wouldn't accept those who were different (at the time the Civil Rights movement was just making headway) and it's something we need to be aware of even now. The story of the X-Men was just another way to make us consider that though different in some ways, we are all at our core the same.<br /><br />The special effects here are well done. Theynever go over the top or try to make the viewer jump up screaming WOW, but are toned down to give us what we need to see and know without taking center stage. In so doing, we remain focused on the story with that added touch along for the ride.<br /><br />It's nice to see that they've taken this story and set the stage for more to be told. With this fresh take one can only hope that more will be made. Oh, and one small mention. This film contains one of the funniest best done cameos since ZOMBIELAND. Just be aware that it uses the F bomb if you have small children. X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is a great example of a comic come to life on film and would be well worth adding to your collection.never go over the top or try to make the viewer jump up screaming WOW, but are toned down to give us what we need to see and know without taking center stage.

B005HI4LLY|5.0|I can't begin to state how much I love this movie. Since coming in I've watched it three times and feel like I could watch it again and still find myself laughing all the way. That's rare these days and for me was a special treat as the same week I first watched it I fell in love with ATTACK THE BLOCK as well. To find one movie that can be rewatched over and over again is rare but two the same week?<br /><br />While not an outright parody, the movie takes set ups for horror movies that have become rather routine and turns them upside down to make one funny movie. Having recently sat through WRONG TURN 4, this movie was a perfect match for that with the exception that this one was so much better.<br /><br />A stereotypical group of college students are on their way to a camping trip in the back woods of West Virginia. On the road they are passed by two stereotypically looking redneck hillbillies in their battered old truck. Of course the students conjure up images of killer hillbillies when they see them.<br /><br />On the other hand we get to meet the pair from their perspective. Tucker and Dale are just two friends on their way to a cabin that Tucker has just purchased. This will be their summer getaway retreat where they can fish and drink beer and have a good old time. Their interest in college kids is for the most part non-existent.<br /><br />They encounter the same duo when they stop at a general store to buy beer and ice. There Dale tells Tucker that the one girl is really good looking. Tucker encourages him to go talk to them girls and show confidence when he does so by smiling and laughing. Of course when Dale chooses to walk over while holding a scythe and then giggling maniacally the kids think he's a psycho ready to kill them.<br /><br />Each group reaches their destination and the lead guy with the kids sits at the campfire telling them about a killer who once roamed the woods they are now in. Descriptions of hillbilly killers who hunted down a group of campers set the teens on edge which they break by deciding to go skinny dipping. One of them, Allison, falls and hits her head. Who comes to her rescue but Tucker and Dale, out on the lake drinking beer and fishing. When they call to the kids for help, the kids think they've captured their friend and are eating her face (as opposed to giving her mouth to mouth).<br /><br />The next morning Allison wakes to discover the two men aren't crazy at all and begins to get to know them. At the same time the students have formed their own opinion. Having seen movies about killer hillbillies, they've decided that Allison has been kidnapped and set out to rescue her. What follows is a comedy of errors where teens view every action as an attack and where Tucker and Dale see each failed attack as being done by crazy college kids who they assume have joined for a suicide pact.<br /><br />The humor in this film is so over the top that just as you finish laughing at one event another pops up and you start laughing again. One example I can share (since it's in the trailer for the movie) is when Tucker is tossing wood into a wood chipper. One of the kids plans on jumping him. Tucker can't hear a thing over the noise of the chipper and when the kid goes to jump him, Tucker bends down to pick up another piece of wood which results in the kid jumping head first into the chipper. Yes, it's gory but the absurdity of the whole situation makes the entire episode hilarious.<br /><br />The movie is extremely well made, everything from the sets to the directing to the special effects works perfect. The acting is stupendous, especially from Tyler Dabine as Dale and Alan Tudyk as Tucker. It seems as if they were born for these roles.<br /><br />As I said at the beginning this movie had me laughing from start to finish. Fans of horror films will no doubt recognize the source material for many of the scenes in the film. Non-horror fans will laugh at the mishaps over and over again. If you're a fanof humor or a fan of horror or a fan of them combined, then by all means you need to have this film in your collection. I'm looking forward to my fourth viewing with my nephew, a fan of both genres. My guess is I'll have to keep my finger on the remote to pause until he can catch a breath while laughing so hard.of humor or a fan of horror or a fan of them combined, then by all means you need to have this film in your collection.

B007JOM0GC|5.0|I love Katy Perry's re-release of her 2010 album, Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection. I like The One That Got Away (Acoustic), Part of Me, Wide Awake, Dressing Up, E.T. (feat. Kanye West), and Tommie Sunshine's Megasix Smash up. Teenage Dream is a legacy album by Katy Perry. I did enjoy it very much.

1455865192|1.0|I got the audiobook version of this from the library, and it's just atrocious. The folks they've selected to read the book are way too old, and the man is AWFUL at expressive reading. And so far, at least, the story's not all that compelling, either. I'm 10 Chapters in, and I don't think I'm going to read any farther. I can't make myself care about the characters and their stupid drama, and if the author name drops the designer brands Brittany is wearing one more time, I'm going to scream. Maybe I'd enjoy the book more if I was reading it rather than listening to this terrible version, but ugh!

B003TML0VO|2.0|When I purchased this cd, I was expecting some great music. What I got were some remakes of great songs. Some of the songs are ok. Photograph is actually done pretty well, but on the whole, this cd is a huge letdown. A lot of the guitar parts don't even sound like Santana's signature sound. It left me wondering how much he actually contributed to this cd. Other than his name.<br /><br />I'd pass on this one and get some classic Santana music.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|This is the kind of album that you buy several of to give to friends as gifts.  I hear the inspiration of many different styles.  There's pop, rock, prog, fusion, and folk.  My personal favorite track is \\"The Storm\\".  Every single track has grown on me with each listen.  Casey was the wild card for me as a listener and fan, but he nailed every vocal moment.  It turns out that Casey, Neal, and Mike sound amazing together with their vocal harmony and how their voices blend.  I've never heard much of Neal in a backing vocals setting, but I've always thought Mike's voice sounds really good in harmony.<br /><br />If any band can claim it, Flying Colors is the modern-day Beatles.  I only hope that they receive airplay and the marketing that this amazing album deserves.<br /><br />4/11/12 EDIT: The more I listen, the more I like.  It's not prog, but it grows on me as a listener like prog.  I've read a few reviews that say FC isn't anything new.  Personally, I've never heard anything like it.  Maybe my musical horizons are too narrow, but thankfully they're not too narrow to enjoy this album immensely.  Furthermore, while I tried to approach the album with little or no expectations initially, the finished product is far superior to what I could have imagined.  On paper it didn't really make sense, with the collection of musicians.  How would they all work together?  I've come to the conclusion that Bill Evans is a genius or very, very lucky.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|Great game, I can check in whenever I want and still progress. Only thing is there are so many popups, and while I have never accidentally bought anything, they slow the game loading and are ridiculous to get rid of every time. Otherwise, good simple concept, the best of the Story series in my opinion. Add me! suziemidnight

B007FH9GT2|2.0|After sitting for over two hours trying hard to have an open mind, I just ended asking myself \\"Why did Hollywood even bother making this movie?\\".  \\"Were they trying to prove that Hollywood could do it better than Swedish Cinema?\\".  \\"Did they want to reach the audience that simply refuses to read subtitles?\\".<br /><br />If they wanted to make an Americanized version, they should have at least changed the story and characters to take place in the US of A.  The Swedish \\"accents\\" were annoying and everything felt out of place.<br /><br />Yes, I know I feel this way because I watched the original trilogy first, and I would probably feel the same if I watched an Italian version of \\"Gone with the Wind\\", it just would not feel right.  (With all due respect to Italian Cinema, one of my favorites).<br /><br />If you liked this version and have not watched the original Swedish version, I recommend that you do, then judge for yourself.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|I am a big fan of zombie and vampire movies that are done well. Not the corny badly made movies where its just random killing, the movies where there is more to it, and the zombies or vamps are well portrayed, and in this movie they mixed vampires and zombies very well. I also understand how many people say this movie is like the road in the fact it has the same mood to it, but this movie is much more entertaining. It has a great mix of action and story as it follows the survivors trying to get to New Eden. Just overall this movie stood out, definitely worth a watch.

B006SV2LWA|2.0|If you think this movie is going to be some kind of thriller, action, or apocalypse film you will be very disappointed. I understand that they tried to take a realistic point of view, and make it into a clever plague movie, but they did not have to make it so boring. It is not a typical plague movie, I thought it would be more entertaining.  I can't even remember that much about it and I watched it a week ago it was that boring and I typically never say this about a film.
0060873027|1.0|This book is a really poor testament to Mr. Crichton's literary career - possibly it is more a reflection of the writer brought in to finish it than it is of Crichton.  His previous books were much more believable.<br /><br />The book is poorly written in that it does not flow well. It conveniently jumps ahead anytime there is a difficult situation to overcome.  While it is science fiction it show a rather scary lack of knowledge about basic science (again probably more of a reflection of the other writer).<br /><br />The way the ending was written it appears to leave room for a sequel - I hope that does not happen.<br /><br />Do not waste your time reading this.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I thought I would hate this movie for two reasons, It was foreign and it was about trolls, but after seeing the good reviews and being very bored I decided to try it out. At first I didn't know what to think, it started a bit slow, but I kept with it, and I am glad I did it was a very good and interesting movie.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The book is a must read for persons interested in trying to understand the social structure of the south in the 60's. While entertaining and well written, the book also causes one to pause and reflect on his own biases in society.
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|The Blu-ray disc that I received worked just fine. I don't know about the DVD< but it was shrink wrapped like brand new, so I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />The issue I have is that the music box is broken and messed up. The box itself was broken and the music doesn't play properly. It sounds as though it was installed backwards, so it plays the song backwards. I considered purchasing this as a gift for someone as well...glad I didn't!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is wonderful. people complaining about the price are ridiculous. If you cant afford 3 bucks for such a well crafted game, you should probably be spending your time doing something productive. Awesome twist. on the original.
B0031RS4WU|3.0|The book is a wonderful story, is moving and well told. A really good example of comics. HOWEVER...  This kindle version is poorly produced. The frames appear to be simply scanned in and rendered in low resolution jpegs which are spoiled by a high rate of articles. You want to view full screen and immerse in the book, but doing so makes it harder to read because of the degradation. You are forced to keep the page at a smaller size and strain a little to see the detail. This is true both of the new iPad with its hi-def screen, and on my PC. I sincerely suggest ordering the book instead if you don't need to read it like yesterday. Below are imgur links to two iPad screenshots to demonstrate this issue. The first is \\"as-is\\" without zooming, and the second with the comic filling the screen. The jpeg artifacting is entirely as it appears on screen, not a result of a poor quality screenshot.<br /><br />Normal view: [...]<br />Zoomed view: [...]
B006XBSAP2|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of the original 2010 release of \\"Teenage Dream,\\" so I won't rehash all that has been said.  But I will point out that the album spawned an incredible SIX number one singles.  And whether you ultimately like Katy Perry or not, there is no denying that power of numbers like that.  Teenage Dream is a benchmark album for pop music. Period.<br /><br />Yet if you somehow missed out buying the album, here's a chance to not only rectify that oversight, but receive a nice reward for your latter-day conversion to Camp Katy.  In addition to the 12 original tracks--at least 9 of which are great tunes (sorry, Katy, I'm never gonna like \\"Peacock\\"), here are 7 new reasons to pick this one up:<br /><br />\\"The One That Got Away (acoustic)\\": After 5 upbeat, danceable number ones in a row, the album cooled down with this bittersweet mid-tempo number.  The acoustic version doesn't necessarily better the original, but it's still very cool.  If you bought Katy's [[ASIN:B002QEXNDO MTV Unplugged (CD & DVD)]] a few years back, you know that she can really make a sparse arrangement shine with her unique voice.<br /><br />\\"Part of Me\\": The newest single, and record-breaking SEVENTH number one single from the album.  It's great upbeat Katy, in the same vein as \\"Hot N Cold.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wide Awake\\": Hypnotic club number that moves along the same speed as \\"E.T.\\"  Probably the least of the 3 all-new studio tracks, but still very good.<br /><br />\\"Dressin' Up\\": A sexy little bit of fantasy indulgence in which Katy actually makes lines like \\"You wanna pet my kitty/You're such a dirty doggie\\" work.  Yeah, really.  The grinding music in the verses gives way to a raving dancefloor chorus.  Possibly a future classic?<br /><br />\\"E.T. feat. Kanye West\\": OK, I have to tell you I'm no fan of insane racist West.  But this is the version of the song that accompanied the music video, so it's nice for completists to have it on the album proper.<br /><br />\\"Last Friday Night feat. Missy Elliott\\": Now, this is what a remix should be.  Rapper Elliott's intro and mid-song breakdown fit rather organically with the stomping rhythm of this classic tune.<br /><br />\\"Tommie Sunshine's Megasix Smash-up\\": An agreeable mixing of the first six singles from the album is a fitting closer.  Just try to sit still as the beat moves you effortlessly from hit to hit.<br /><br />There you have it.  \\"The Complete Confection\\" is exactly what a deluxe re-release should be.  It's also probably one of THE best pop albums in years.  Even if you already have the original disc, it's definitely worth an upgrade.issy Elliott\\": Now, this is what a remix should be.

145162445X|5.0|Reading the reviews, it's obvious that a lot of theists are blaming Krauss for the scientific implication that no god was necessary to create the universe, and are punishing him with low ratings.<br /><br />In fact the book is an enlightening, witty and highly accessible book about a complex and counter-intuitive subject. If you are truly interested in understanding how the universe came to exist, this is the best book you will find on the subject, and I've read most of them.  If you're just interested in confirming your religious biases, you'll find what you're looking for Stephen Barr's book, Modern Physics and Ancient Faith.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Well, after 30 years in the freaking fickle-minded pop biz, what's there that Madonna needs to prove? From early days where detractors slagged her off to the glorious and critical moments she's had in every decade since the 80s, she's done and seen it all. With MDNA, she does what she does best, pop music. Though employing Nicki Minaj and, to a lesser extent, MIA, is an attempt to be hip and current, MDNA is still a piece of da*mn fine pop music. It may not be her best but certainly not her worst. Critics enjoy their moments of slagging her off once more, complaining everything from the lack of lyrical depth to her not pushing the envelope, but the reality is far from true. While Goldfrapp sings a song titled Ooh La La, when Madonna uses the same three words on the infectious Superstar, it becomes cliched suddenly to critics. I'm a Sinner, Girl Gone wild and Love Spent are some of the finest moments on the album. Some silly reviewer likened Gang Bang to something Britney Spears would do, but hell freezes over if Britney was half as brilliant and sophisticated. The trippy urban I Don't Give a featuring Minaj could do without the guest but it is so instantly catchy and infectious. Downtempo moments on Love Spent, Masterpiece, I F*** Up and Falling Free are gorgeous balladry.  Listen to the album and enjoy the 4-year break. If the current crop of whoever makes their career 30 odd illustrious years into the future, we will proclaim a new Queen. For now, the real Queen is back, age- and gravity-defying. Her DNA remains.
B000HT3P7E|2.0|I know that a lot of people enjoy (and it is good for them!) this tv show. In my case, truth to be told, I am not into this kind of humour/jokes.<br /><br />The actors/actresses are ok, I guess.<br /><br />The jokes are funny if you are into this type of humour. Not my case, unfortunately.<br /><br />And after several seasons, there is a \\"sense of deja vu\\" that it is not very good.<br /><br />But like I said, if people enjoy this show... excellent! It certainly is a tv show that is good and nice for the fans.<br /><br />Just not my type. That is all.
B00756GKBA|1.0|I won't spend a lot of time on this one.  This album is simply an embarrassment, and I've been a fan of Madonna since I was 11 in 1983.  Please, Madonna:  Go back to the \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" days.  Oh, wait...\\"Bedtime Stories\\" was good.  After \\"Ray of Light,\\" it's been downhill.  Where's Jellybean when we need him??!<br /><br />Additionally, the one of the most disturbing things I've found while reading these reviews is this:  Check out the reviews where people have left something negative about this horrible album.  You'll find some seemingly crazed fan-person commenting back, as if we can't have our own opinion.  You'd think this woman has some of these queens under a spell or something.  I'm sorry, people, but crap is crap, even if you put it in a nice little package with a bow on top.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Movie has a great story. Would recommend it to others. My viewing experience was very poor, however. The movie kept stopping and starting, so it was very distracting. When it would reload, the picture was blurry for a while making it frustrating to watch. But the movie itself was great.

0439023521|3.0|I am not totally sold on this book.  It really does control the reader, while other books give you time to think about other solutions to problems or what might happen next.  This book is just too controlling, which is the way the games are played.  The actual games are exciting but what comes before and what comes right at the end is a big cop out by the author IMHO.  I can't tell the end results but I do still feel manipulated.  And I am going to try to see the movie ASAP, just to see how close it comes to the book. No, I enjoyed the book, but do not see all the great reviews and reaction it has obtained.

B006ISJQ3K|5.0|so many fans have awaited this complete album release and finally it's here. some fans may not appreciate the early takes and unreleased songs that did not make it on the 'diana ross' album but i, for one, just love it to pieces. i love hearing all of the alternate versions of hits like 'theme from mahogany' and 'love hangover' just to name a few. thanks hip-o-select and keep'em coming.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I knew at minimum this would be worth getting for the musicianship alone, but its surpassed my expectations!  This is some killer music period.
B005U3V7MC|1.0|don't waste your money on this book.  i have never been so disappointed in an author.  it seemed like just an easy way to rip people off and take their money.  boring, boring, boring.  just a rehash all the way from start to finish of \\"pride and prejudice\\" as if we needed reminding.  nothing really happens!!<br />p.s. this is written by vicki henry, not ted, he doesn't read! lol
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just what I expected perfect for all including my kids<br />it is fun to unlock the games. It is also nice that it is free.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I can not believe I spent $10 on uneditted Twilight fan fiction! There are actually places in the \\"story\\" that still have names and references to Twilight characters.  I wish I had read the numerous bad reviews before I bought this book.  Not worth the money or time spent on it.  It is clearly poorly written fan fiction from Twilight series.  If you haven't already bought it, save your money for something else.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have read most all of Sophie Kinsella's books to date and this is the best one to date.  If you are considering purchasing it and like her style of writing, this is a must-read!  It has several twists that you do not expect.  I read the book start to finish in one day.  And when I came to \\"The End\\" I said No! Not because of how it ended but because I didn't want to be done!  I really loved it and found it so entertaining.  Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the purchase of this book!  You will not be disappointed!
B00756GKBA|5.0|Finally! Madonna is back after the lackluster \\"Hard Candy\\". Love all the tracks especially \\"Falling Free\\" and \\"Turn Up The Radio\\". This album is like the lovechild of Confessions and Ray of Light. I don't know what else to say because this album is overwhelmingly great! Buy.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've owned my headset for quite awhile now.  My previous Logitech headset was crap, some foam-padded, low-level-mic, POS that barely worked correctly for me.  I tossed that piece of junk years ago and opted instead for just headphones.  After years of using just headphones, I felt it would be best to finally get back into using headsets to communicate--I skype a lot more, I'm a better gamer because of it (TF2, BF3, L4D2, SCII (to a lesser degree)) and I won't be changing headsets.<br /><br />The set feels very well built.  Unless you like to take your rage out on devices, this is going to last you a long time.  Yes, it is bulky, so if you don't like massive things covering your head, then I wouldn't recommend sticking with this device.  Volume is easy to control, function buttons are nice (although I rarely use them), and the bar mic is actually bendable.<br /><br />However, there are some slight frustrations with this.  First off, if you have an external set of speakers, there's no pass-thru if you have the USB receiver plugged in.  I have my receiver wire plugged into the back and it's a pain just unplugging it if I want to hear things through my speakers.  Luckily, my desktop speakers are crap, so I only play things on them if I want others to hear.<br /><br />Secondly, there seems to be some mystery as to how long one must depress the power button for this thing to actually turn off.  I'll hold it for two seconds, release, and it'll remain on.  Sometimes I hold it for less, other times I hold it for five seconds and it finally disengages.  It would have been nice if Logitech just put an 'on-off' switch instead of a power button, so I don't have to hold the thing in and hope that it turns on/off when I release it.<br /><br />As for other reviews that I've read on here, I doubt that this thing will ever break with normal, continued use.  Also, I've never experienced a buzzing or interference when I enable the mic on it.  I've read just to drop the mic gain and seeif that works, but as far as this unit goes, it's not a problem.<br /><br />Pros:  AWESOME AUDIO, comfortable, wireless and it's LOGITECH!<br />Cons:  Difficult buttons, no pass-thru for external speakers
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Normally I do not for fiction reads but there was all this hype around the book! It surprised me in how well written it was and had an interesting plot. I'd say it is worth reading.
1451627289|5.0|I haven't read many Stephen King novels, but prior to this book, I have always thought his stories to be very engaging, but the endings fall flat. 11/22/63 is definitely different from his standard fair though. I very much enjoyed this book, I thought the idea of it was really cool-what if JFK had not been assassinated.<br /><br />In this creative novel Jake Epping is shown a \\"rabbit hole\\" that takes him back to a specific date in 1958 each time it is entered. A man who has been using the portal for years talks him in to living in the past long enough to prevent JFK's assassination, but we soon learn that the past will do whatever it must to prevent alteration of what is already written.<br /><br />I feel, like many others, that he was a little long winded in places and could have cut out 100-200 pages. That aside, this is a really fun read worthy of your attention, so you must not let its size scare you.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this book when I first started reading it. As I got farther into the book, I could NOT put it down. This is one of the rare books that actually provides a history of the main character without leaving you to wonder.  I don't like to give away details of a book but I will say I was surprised at some of the turns that it took with the characters, especially Ivory. The writer had me engrossed by the end to the point I even gasped a couple times as I read.<br /><br />It was different than the normal \\"vampire/werewolf/fantasy\\" books that are so popular which is what I liked most.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what direction the author takes the sequel!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever had.  They are so light that I hardly know that I'm wearing them.  I bought an extra set in case these break, as I've read they do after about a year.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoy this game, the sound effects are so so, but the game is great. It  reminds me of the arcade original.
B000683VI4|5.0|I did not expect this to be good. In fact I wanted this to be obnoxious and sappy just because I was certain that Hollywood couldn't make a good love story anymore. Well I was proved wrong. I'm not really into love stories and the like but this movie was both touching and pure in a way that we as humans all strive to be. I would gladly recommend it to anyone who thinks they have a heart of stone and they won't cry at these movies. I know I did.
B006UKC566|4.0|I just bought this movie today. I've been waiting for what seems like forever to see this movie, and let me tell you, I was not dissapointed. This movie's bad-ass!! Don't listen to the idiots that give this movie negative reviews, they don't know what their talking about. 1. They criticize the violence, how bloody the fight sequences are, especially between the gods and the titans. Last time I checked when you're in a battle and stab, slice or crush someones skull in, flowers and candy don't spill out. 2. They criticize how dark the movie is, by dark I mean lighting. Some people said they had to squint their eyes to watch it. If that's the case then maybe you should look into buying glasses for yourself. I saw it just fine and I don't even own a hi-def tv at this time! Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and I respect that, but sometimes some peoples opinions are so stupid that you just have step up and say something. Of course this is just one mans opinion, and in my opinion this movie kicks major butt!! Hope they make a sequel, I would definatly buy it when it came out!
B006ZJJ70O|5.0|I completely agree with Discophage that this a welcome reissue of the 14 CD box. BUT, unlike the original release...<br /><br />- There is a complete abscence of documentation. In the first set, each CD had its own text leaflet containing 8 pages (including 4-5 pages with text).<br /><br />- More than half of the recordings in the original set were available in Dolby Surround (fully compatible with CD), so it was possible to have surround sound with an external 5.1 receiver.<br /><br />These differences may be of less importance to some buyers. On the other hand it MAY be that the newer release is redigitalized. A 24-bit icon on the back of the box suggests that it is so, but you can't take anything for granted with the music industry of today!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well what can I say? It surpised me, in that I really liked this book. Lots of action and angst and really a wonderful romance is starting to take place but one of the main characters is fighting it. And really I can't blame her. Who knows whose to live or die. That makes it hard to hang on to someone. Anyway I'm digressing. I just wanted to say that I was putting off reading this book because of what the excerpts say and what I thought the premise of the book was. I felt it was just not my type of book. Boy was I wrong and I loved every minute of this book. The author told a really good story and drew me in. For those hold outs like me run and grab this book and read it. It is not what you'll expect. You will be very pleasantly surprised and in a good way. I definitely recomend this book. Now I'm going to have to see the movie!!(less)
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Great movie! If you like Southpark, you will like this movie.  It's satire is comical in a sense, just keep an open mind. I was pleased with the ease of renting through Amazon.  I was able to rent it through my tv and watch it at my leisure.

1906147639|3.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is told through the narrative of a lawyer, John Utterson that hears a tale from a friend of a mysterious Mr. Hyde that tramples a girl.  To Mr. Utterson, the most disturbing part of the story is that the girl is paid off through a cheque signed by Dr. Jekyll, a friend of Mr. Utterson.  Mr. Utterson seeks to understand the strange connection between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The later part of the story is narrated through letters by Dr.  Lanyon and Dr. Jekyll explaining the mystery.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. I had forgotten a lot of the details of the story so it was very interesting to listen to it again.  I like how Dr. Jekyll reveled in being able to separate his dark side and to enjoy living without moral obligations as Mr. Hyde.  But he soon finds his Hyde self was out of control in his way of living, and in control of Dr. Jekyll.  At first he had to take a potion to become Hyde, but soon he had to take a potion to not become Hyde.  It was very interesting how the dark side ultimately took him over.  SPOILER END.<br /><br />Sadly I think Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have become so commonplace in our society that it really takes away from the story to read or listen to it now.  It must have been quite shocking to read it for the first time, not knowing the truth. Now it takes away from the entire climax of the story to already know the ending.  I didn't particularly like the narrative structure of the story either, having it narrated by Mr. Utterson and then concluded by a couple of longish letters.<br /><br />The version I listened to by CSA Word was very hard to listen too.  It was recorded so low that even when turned up all of the way, I could hardly hear what was going on.  This was very distracting and made it hard to focus on the story.<br /><br />Overall, Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a very inventive and compelling story.  The only flaw is that it is so compelling that everyone knows what Jekyll and Hyde are and it ruins the climax of the story.<br /><br />This review was originally published on my blog, Laura's Reviews.uins the climax of the story.<br /><br />This review was originally published on my blog, Laura's Reviews.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Being a fan of Gary Oldman and suspense films, I hoped I was in for a treat.  Sadly, this film didn't have a pulse and I turned it off mid-way.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|PREPARE TO BE WOWED:<br />Well to answer the title, I'll get into that later. But let me start off by saying that The Dark Knight was a cinematic adventure. It was a movie in which after you watched it, you talked about it. Yes, there's Heath Ledger--and he did a phenomenal job; and yes, he died and that beefed up the box-office numbers.<br /><br />But, people are forgetting something. The Dark Knight had a great script, a great cast, AWE-INSPIRING CINEMATOGRAPHY, a great score; it was emotional, entertaining, thought provoking, DARK, funny, sad, scary; it felt like Michael Mann's Heat mixed with The Godfather mixed with Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />TWO COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:<br />1. Heath Ledger made the film.<br />Response: no, Christopher Nolan made the film (no pun intended). Have you seen his track record lately?<br />2. Heath Ledger only won an oscar because he died.<br />Response: no, Heath Ledger won an oscar because it was one of the greatest performaces in history, period, and the Academy Awards would have been stoned to death for ignoring his performance whether dead or alive. Heck, they were almost stoned to death for not giving the film and Nolan an oscar nomination as it was.<br /><br />HOW COULD IT NOT BE A 5/5:<br />Well, some people don't like to think. My Aunt didn't like the movie because it was too confusing. (This is the director of Memento, must I remind you.) People who don't like to think may not like this movie. It's as simple as that.<br /><br />Also . . . people might lie and just give this a bad score because The Dark Knight is considered one of the greatest films of ALL TIME. Check the IMDB top 250. Thousands and thousands of voters must share a common feelings, that TDK is a pretty fricken awesome film.<br /><br />BLU-RAY:<br />Surprisingly I think the Batman Begins Blu-Ray has more features than The Dark Knight Blu-Ray, but seriously, does it matter? All that matters is that you can watch one of the greatest, most thought-provoking, most entertaining films ever.<br /><br />P.S. This is one of the shortest reviews I've ever written because The Dark Knight is such an overwhelming force that it's hard to dissect it in a way that millions of other fanboys hadn't already., most entertaining films ever.<br /><br />P.S.

0307888908|5.0|\\"The Start Up of You\\" by Reid Hoffman (co-founder and chairman of LinkedIn) and Ben Casnocha is a wonderful, positive and empowering book and tailored for the Internet generation.<br /><br />While reading this book, I was very thrilled because it's a book that relates to me and I have similar beliefs and I absolutely agree with his use of GM and the city of Detroit during its heyday and how America had become complacent in recognizing competition and also adapting to change.<br /><br />Back in 2000, when I worked I left Silicon Valley to open the eyes of Newspapers transitioning to the Internet, no one wanted change.  Everyone in corporate believed the almighty newspaper would not be hurt by the Internet back then and in meetings, I would go about \\"adapting to change\\", prepare for the future and I realized at the end of the day, all that mattered to the corporation was how many people can make more money in \\"banner\\" advertising.<br /><br />You go back and read a lot of similar-related books and while the principles are good, the mentality is outdated.  There has to be a new approach to business, a new approach for those of today for those who want to apply the entrepreneurial skill set to their career.<br /><br />In the words of Reid Hoffman/Ben Casnocha, this book - \\"It's about keeping Detroit from happening to you\\".<br /><br />From companies such as LinkedIn, Netflix, Groupon, Pandora, PayPal to name a few...these are the companies you will be reading about.  How they adapted to change, how useful it is to use social media in promotion but also meeting people to creating beneficial and important networks.<br /><br />This is not the type of book that is so different from books of the past few decades.  The times have changed and there are opportunities to make things happen for people using the Internet, social media and working on yourself and adapting to the future.<br /><br />A fantastic book,enjoyable and insightful and well-written.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ed!
0930289234|5.0|FIRST BOOK I'VE EVER READ:<br />In high school, I didn't read because I thought all the books we were assigned were boring or childish, and at home my parents weren't readers, and hey, I had an X-Box 360. And then one of my favorite film directors, Zach Snyder (aside from Sucker Punch), was going to make this movie called Watchmen. So, of course I looked it up and learned it was based on a graphic novel of the same name. It was one of TIME's magazine's greatest 100 books of ALL TIME--books, not \\"comic books\\" (and Watchmen IS NOT a comic book: that needs to be put out on the table right here and now in case that's a turn off). And then when my family was going to take out yearly trip to Daytona Beach, Florida, I told my mom I wanted to get a book. She was shocked that I would even ask (even though she considered Watchmen a comic book, but hey, it had words), so she bought it on the spot even though at the time it was twenty dollars or so.<br /><br />Watchmen was the first book I've ever read. It was a gateway book to George Orwell's 1984, and then from there on . . . I became a chronic reader. So, first and foremost, there's a great respect for Watchmen. It didn't get me into other graphic novels, per se, it got me into real literature! But here's the thing: I don't consider comic books/graphic novels having real substance, but I don't consider Watchmen a comic book and certainly not an average picture oriented graphic novel. Watchmen is all about the words! And there are lots. And to be honest, that COULD be a turn off for someone having to read so much. So, in a sense, Watchmen is more or less between a hard and soft spot in terms of its audience. But only because it's risky art.<br /><br />THE WORLD OF WATCHMEN:<br />\\"One of us died tonight . . . somebody knows why.\\" And that's the thesis to the entire novel and I believe the first line, if not one of the first lines in the book. Watchmen takes place in a alternate history where Nixon was president for many terms and people dressed up and faught. Not necessarily crime, but they faught against what they believed in. And that is what separates this superhero bunch from others; their motives differ. It's a big political analogy in a way. Rorschach represents Conservatism, Ozymandias represents Liberalism, The Comedian represents war, Dr. Manhattan represents coldhearted, unbias logic, whereas Silk Spectre and Nite Owl represent the common, everyday American citizen that cares more about love and worries more about paying the bills or taking care of mother than to get into this murder mystery full of political angst. Knowing these characters was the first time I understood American politics. And Alan Moore (known to be anti-government) did not entirely make it a rigged message, per se, for instance the characters each have their beliefs and I had always been on Rorschach's side, even though there was a piece of information in which following Rorschach's plan would have cost the world billions of deaths. Alan doesn't make the reader like characters; instead the reader has the choice to like whom they will, and usually they'll like characters according to their own politics.<br /><br />In a way, Watchmen is a \\"what political affiliation are you?\\" test--I only say that half-jokingly.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I'll get around to rereading Watchmen every now and then. It's a book full of political tension and it doesn't matter if you're Liberal, Conservative, Independent, Libertarian, or just don't care at all, because simply there's a character for everyone, and the message is never preachy; the message is simply: if sellout your morality and humanity, you'll save the world--it's a bitter cup to swallow. Do you kill a few to save many or do the right thing and kill many? It's an ethical question and there is hard to find the right answer; but that's what Watchmen deals with. Identity.<br /><br />In other words, if you're a comic book reader, Watchmen will be wordy, but worth theread; if you're a \\"I will never read comic books\\" person, well, Watchmen honestly is not going to be a backslide in your intellect. It takes effort and time to read it, unlike your typical graphic novel that you could read in a day. (Of course everybody has their reading speeds, and speaking of which, I recommending reading this book slower as opposed to quickly because there it a poetic quality about the words, almost like reading Cormac McCarthy.)read; if you're a \\"I will never read comic books\\" person, well, Watchmen honestly is not going to be a backslide in your intellect.

145162445X|5.0|In just a couple hundred pages, Lawrence Krauss makes accessible to the layman, the complexity of how physics is able to explain the existence of the universe. Thousands upon thousands of brilliant minds have labored, reviewed, revised, and held one another to rigorous standards, to get us where we are today in our understanding of the origin of the universe. It is an amazing time to exist in human history, as knowledge expands exponentially and we are better able to understand the vast universe that spawned us. We are the universe becoming self aware.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This is among the best books I have read for some years. I came upon it in The Economist's Books of the Year, 2011, which contains a number of noteworthy recent books.<br /><br />Pinker in my view successfully argues for the slightly counter-intuitive trend of declining violence throughout history, at least since biblical times. Not only does he demonstrate the trend convincingly, he offers some explanations of why this might be so (hence the \\"better angels of our nature\\"). I found that the explanations make this work a masterpiece, and the 800 page truly worthwhile.<br /><br />I happened to read this book almost right after finishing Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, and found that the two works go well in parallel (it is interesting to ponder if Kahneman's System 2 has been gaining the upper hand over System 1 throughout history). Also after reading The Better Angels of Our Nature, I had to rethink my attitude of the importance of moral philosophy and of  Immanuel Kant's work in particular. To be clear though - the book is not about moral philosophy, so don't let this aspect keep you from reading the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well worth the investment of time.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I have just finished reading this book which was presented to me as an insight into the mind of autistic children.  While it was enjoyable, I have to say that this was more about a gifted, highly functional austic child, and while it was an intristing insight, I have to say it was not the norm.<br /><br />I think what I fear most, is that people will consider this to be the norm, that the autistic child will have some exception skill, in this case in math and science.  This was proved to me as a middle school teacher, who reportedly had taught austic students felt that yes, most of them excel in math and sciences.  The reality of it is that there is a wide band of what qualifies as autistic.  It seems she had the very special ones, teaching at a competitive magnet school.  There was no basis in reality.  The reality, less than ONE PERCENT are gifted in any field.  They are lucky to be able to talk and write their name.<br /><br />It was an intersting read, just PLEASE do not mistake this as being the 'norm'.

B0041B785Y|5.0|so many evocative and significant moments within Koloss... which magically seem to have multiplied, in some ratio, to the amount of times I've listened. It only gets better! From the destroy-the-Earth ferocity of \\"Demiurge\\", to the other-worldly emotion that peaks at 4:42 of \\"Behind The Sun\\" and 3:00 of \\"Do Not Look Down\\", to the broken-thrash-grind of \\"Marrow\\", this is perhaps Meshugga's most complete album. It's Metalgasmic. For any unfamiliar - you DON'T KNOW what you've been missing.<br /><br />It's a far cry from \\"Chaosphere\\" but it's far more inclusive than any other Meshuggah album to date IMO, I think many would agree. As for me, life will be complete until I wear this album out.

B0077ATSSQ|1.0|Considering it was based on the novel of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer, the young writer whose success has polarized a portion of the literary community, it's not surprising that Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close has had nearly the same effect on most people. The only film nominated for this year's Best Picture Oscar that I would give 1 star, Extremely Loud stars former Kids Jeopardy! winner-turned-actor Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, son of a 9/11 victim, who must learn to cope with life in the wake of his father's death. A year after the tragedy, when Oskar discovers a mysterious key among his father's belongings, he sets out to discover what it unlocks. Extremely Loud is a worthy story to tell, but director Stephen Daldry tells it in such a pretentious and shamelessly sentimental fashion as to make it distasteful.

B004EPZ034|1.0|The Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise isn't exactly held up as a paragon of contemporary cinema, but even for its low standards, its latest installment, Chipwrecked, failed on pretty much every level. In this third animated/live-action romp, the titular trio and their female counterparts are stranded on a deserted island when a parasailing mishap leads them astray; caretaker Dave and his old boss Ian work together to locate and rescue their furry friends. I found the film forgettable, with recycled humor and lazy writing that made for an obnoxious and unfunny moviegoing experience. But, as with so many movies of this nature, I must keep in mind that I am not the target audience here, and must concede that if you're just looking for something mindless to keep your very young children at bay for a couple of hours, this might do the trick.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|George R.R. Martin goes for another pay check with this interminable narrative. Nothing has really happened in this series since book two. There are so many characters, many of which are not seen often, that the whole mess is confusing and boring. Where are the white walkers? What ever happened to the rest of the Stark clan? Where is the black dragon? On and on. I am trying to finish this book in the hope that something interesting happens. The book does a decent job describing this world but the fun in the first book has long since gone away. I will not read a book six.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|For his third collaboration with director David Cronenberg, Viggo Mortensen took on the role of famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, playing opposite Michael Fassbender as his younger colleague Carl Jung and Keira Knightley as Sabina Spielrein, the woman who came between them. With that kind of pedigree and its provocative subject matter, A Dangerous Method picked up some early awards buzz that unfortunately burned off by the time the Oscars came around, though Mortensen did pick up a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Golden Globes. The performances from its distinguished three leads are amazing. If historical drama and psychosexual tension are your thing, this one's definitely worth a look.
1400069289|5.0|Quick: What did you do this morning? Chances are that you did the same thing you did yesterday. We are creatures of routine. \\"All of our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,\\" wrote William James in 1892. In many ways, we are the product of the habits we've created.<br /><br />The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business has a central argument: \\"Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.\\" The rest of the book shows how habits work, how to create new habits, and how to change habits. It then applies these lessons to individuals, organizations, and societies in general.<br /><br />I'll say one thing about this book: it's a fun read. I read this book on vacation last week, and it was anything but a chore to read. The stories and insights are fascinating. You can tell a book is good when you want to talk about it with others. A book on habits could be boring; this one isn't.<br /><br />In short, habits consist of a cue, a routine, and a reward. Habits never really disappear, but, with work, the routine can be changed. Changing habits is relatively simple, but often very hard as well. It begins with understanding how habits work, and applying that knowledge to the habits that you want to change.<br /><br />This book reminded me a lot of the teachings of BJ Fogg. If you're only looking for information on how to change personal habits, that's all you need. The Power of Habit gave me some new information on individual habits, and a lot of great stories, but the framework is basically the same.<br /><br />It really was helpful to learn how habits apply to organizations and even societies. I noticed this on the long drive home from our vacation: even fast food establishments have habits, consistent throughout the chain. Some of the habits are a lot nicer than others. If you lead an organization, this part of the book provides valuable and unique insights.<br /><br />The book uses Saddleback Church as an example of spreading habits throughout a society. In this case, it sees Saddleback as a movement. At first I bristled, but I came around. There are elements of a movement in what Saddleback has created. It was interesting to see a megachurch through the lens of a book like this one.<br /><br />While this is a useful book, I think it's important to think not only of habits but of what Jonathan Edwards called affections. The problem is not just our habits. The problem is that our desires are disordered. We want the wrong things. A book like this isn't meant to deal with these deeper issues, but if you're interested in really seeing someone change, you have to go there.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. Along with the work of BJ Fogg, I now have a greater understanding of habits and how to change them. I've read a lot of boring books on interesting topics. I was glad to read an interesting book on what could be a boring topic. Habits shape us; understanding how habits work is an important part of changing the habits we live with every day of our lives.g habits throughout a society.

B0031RSA24|5.0|What a great read. If any thinking person had their doubts before reading this book, Dawkins has blown the age old fairy tale out of the water. Every religious person I have ever met has a totally closed mind because they have been indoctrinated from birth & refuse to think outside the square. How could anyone read his book and still believe the collection of fables written by imaginative scribes from the dark ages.
B000002GYN|4.0|The Eagles got on the road to superstardom in early '72 with their self-titled, Glyn Johns-produced debut album.  I didn't become a real fan of theirs until I was in college, although I liked the Eagles' music.  Along with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, they were part of the Southern California music sound, which is a country-rock sound.  Fans of the Eagles also ought to know that three of the guys(Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner) were backup musicians for Linda Ronstadt before the Eagles became a musical entity, and Randy also was an original member of the country-rock band Poco.  The Eagles' debut isn't perfect, but it's a solid first record.<br /><br />Of course, one of the highlights is the debut single \\"Take It Easy\\", which Glenn Frey co-wrote with Jackson Browne.  \\"Take It Easy\\" has some great guitar work, and Bernie Leadon plays solid banjo in the background.  \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", the second hit off this record, is a romantic nod to the band's Southern California home:  \\"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay/Against your skin so brown/And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight/With a billion stars all around.\\"  \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" was composed by Jack Tempchin, who also wrote the Eagles' rocking hit \\"Already Gone\\" and co-wrote a lot of Glenn Frey's solo hits.  Glenn Frey's fiery rocker \\"Chug All Night\\" features some of the funky \\"talk box\\" guitar playing that was popularized by Joe Walsh--who, ironically, would replace Bernie as an Eagle when the band recorded Hotel California in '76.  Another Jackson Browne composition, \\"Nightingale\\", is a rocking ode to a blooming romance:  \\"Here comes my baby/Singin' like a nightingale.\\"  Considering that Jackson Browne's major hits--\\"Doctor My Eyes\\", \\"Rock Me On The Water\\", \\"Here Come Those Tears Again\\", \\"The Pretender\\", \\"Tender Is The Night\\" and \\"Running On Empty\\"--were serious songs, \\"Nightingale\\" is one of those rare Jackson Browne-composed songs that is fun to listen to.  \\"Nightingale\\" is also one of only two songs on this record where Don Henley sings the lead vocal; the other is \\"Witchy Woman\\", the third of this album's hits.  Besides Don's vocal, the song has some of Bernie's strongest guitar work.<br />  Throughout his career as an Eagle, besides being a solid musician, Bernie composed great songs, and this record has a couple of Bernie's best tunes.  \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\", which Bernie co-wrote with founding Byrd Gene Clark, is perhaps the most \\"country\\" song the Eagles ever recorded--after \\"Hollywood Waltz\\", \\"Midnight Flyer\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", and the majority of the songs from Desperado.  \\"Earlybird\\" is a peppy, bluegrassy number that features some of Bernie's best banjo picking and also has some solid guitar playing by Glenn Frey.<br /><br />I'm split on the songs sung by Randy Meisner.  Randy didn't write \\"Most Of Us Are Sad\\"--it was written by Randy's fellow Eagle Glenn Frey.  However, Randy has a strong voice which more than overcomes the song's gloomy lyrics:  \\"Most of us are sad/No one lets it show/I've been shadows of myself/How was I to know.\\"  Randy's own composition \\"Take The Devil\\" comes close to his Eagles-era masterpieces:  \\"Certain Kind Of Fool\\", \\"Too Many Hands\\", and the big hit \\"Take It To The Limit\\".  Listening to the lyrics, \\"Open up your eyes, take the devil from your mind/He's been holding on to you/And you're so hard to find\\", you get a real sense of desperation.  Is the singer literally fleeing demons, or is the Devil merely a reflection of one's own fears?  However, Randy also composed this record's weakest song.  The closing number \\"Tryin'\\", another Meisner composition, is a formulaic rocker that to me is practically a rip-off of the Rolling Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\".  The lyrics about an aspiring musician--or in the Eagles' case in '72, an up-and-coming group-- don't help the song much:  \\"I'm just arrivin' in the city and there's music on my mind.\\"  In my opinion, not only does Randy rip off another popular group's song, but he also writes about a theme--chasing musical success--that almost every singer has come up with a song about.  Listening to \\"Tryin'\\", I couldn't understand how Randy could write a song like that.  Having heard some of the Eagles' post-Meisner work, I was almost relieved when Randy left the Eagles in '77 and was replaced by Timothy Schmit.  Tim, like Randy an alum of the group Poco, has consistently come out with excellent numbers since joining the Eagles, among them the hits \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\".  And although Randy didn't have many solo hits, his own hit songs \\"Deep Inside My Heart\\" and \\"Hearts On Fire\\" are better than \\"Tryin'\\", the Rolling Stones copycat song the Eagles closed this album with.<br /><br />In summary, the Eagles' debut album isn't perfect, but it is a solid first effort.  They were a genuine team back in '72; all the group members shared songwriting duties, and they also each sang lead on at least one song on this album.  Although I think Desperado, the follow-up to this record, is better, this one is definitely a classic.y rip off another popular group's song, but he also writes about a theme--chasing musical success--that almost every singer has come up with a song about.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The premise of The Hunger Games is not entirely original.  It's evocative of The Lottery, The Running Man, and our nation's lifelong identification with Rome.  It's a well worn premise, but one that is well worn because it can be so very effective.  And in Collins's hands it is just that.<br /><br />The Hunger Games takes place in a dystopian future in Panem, a country consisting of a metropolitan Capitol and twelve outlying districts in what used to be the U.S.  In retribution for a previous rebellion, once a year one boy and girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district is selected by lottery to compete in a televised, possibly weeks-long battle to the death while the nation is forced to watch.  District 12, coal mining country, is the poorest of the districts and has historically performed poorly in the games (I can't help but think of the Battle of King's Mountain and the Battle of Matewan, but I guess they don't cover those in Panem history).<br /><br />The Hunger Games is never preachy.  Collins paints us a picture of life in Panem and the Games and leaves us to draw our own conclusions.  It's a welcome respect for the reader; we shouldn't need to be told anymore than we are to recognize the brutality and cruelty of the Capitol; the psychological torture of the Games, not just on the participants but on the residents of each District; and the prurient voyeurism of the Games.  Collins slowly peels back the layers on Katniss's world as the story progresses, each time showing another ugly side to it and exposing another lie.<br /><br />Collins accomplishes the difficult task of making Katniss feel like a real teenager without turning her into a whiny brat or something akin to a personality-less, bland, pair of pants we can comfortably slip into.  The romance angle of the book works not because it examines rich, fully realized adult love, but because it does not.  Rather, it examines the awkward, half-formed adolescent version of love.  Which is probably harder to pull off than the former, but I think Collins pulls it off quite well; especially considering it's a subject in which I have no particular interest.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is written entirely in the first person.  I found it a bit off-putting at first, and there is little you can do with first person you can't do with a single POV third person limited.  But it works.  In particular, the first person makes Katniss telling us the nuts and bolts of the games in a very clinical fashion less boring than terrifying.  Katniss doesn't think about the broader implications of the society she lives in anymore than any other teenager would, allowing the reader to connect the lines himself.  It does have the disadvantage that we don't see what is happening back in District 12 or outside the arena in general (which I understand the movie remedies).<br /><br />The Hunger Games is marketed as a YA book, and it is an extremely quick and easy read, but it is also an example of speculative fiction at its best, delving into the recesses of human nature.r to pull off than the former, but I think Collins pulls it off quite well; especially considering it's a subject in which I have no particular interest.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is written entirely in the first person.

B007KQXB2G|5.0|Love the show, but the first episode of Season 5 is free on the AMC sites Mad Men page.  I am sure I will be buying the rest here just as I did for Season 2 of The Walking Dead.

At least I'm not missing it all together.

B004132HZS|5.0|Being a lifelong dedicated Sherlock Holmes fan, I was extremely skeptical when introduced to this new series. I hated that insulting new movie that came out a couple of years ago, so I wasnt expecting much when I first started watching this series but was intrigued within the first five minutes, and within ten minutes had declared that I loved it.  By the end of the very first episode I was convinced that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have heartily approved of the way this Sherlock was brought into the modern day, and his techniques were so faithfully applied to everyday concepts and gadgets.<br />The Doctor Watson, is keeping well within the original concept by Doyle, and is not the bumbling fool as portrayed in so many other versions. The two characters are well balanced and complement each other nicely,  even Lestrade is a modernized version of the original concept.<br /> The entire show is a worthy homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, it is witty, fast paced, has some very funny  and elegant one-liners delivered in the same dry style as Doyle originally conceived. The original story lines are very skilfully adapted to the twenty first century without losing the flavour of the original holmes..something that up until now I would have thought impossible. The writers were obviously well versed in the subtle nuances of Doyle's original stories, and stuck as faithfully as possible to the overall concept of the stories whilst updating them into believable modern stories..<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to any dedicated \\"holmesians\\" out there. I believe you will  NOT be disappointed.<br />I am very pleased.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|one of the reasons I love. this app is that it gives. the option. of being read to you the thing I don't like is I cant get into it to leave my own notes when I followed all the instructions but even with that I think its one of the best Bible apps.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I've been an apple fan since 1983. It was quite interesting to learn how all these great products came into being and what it was about them that made them so much fun.  For years I thought it would be cool to meet Steve sometime. After reading the book I'm kind of glad I never had the chance. He was not a nice man, just a gifted genius who changed the world.<br /><br />But this is a great book that makes me want to read more by this author.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big fan of biographies but this is really worth the time.  It's a long book but I read it in less than a week, on my kindle.  Now I sort of wish I had bought the hardcover since the pictures are not that great on the kindle.

0553386794|4.0|I became interested in this book series after watching the television series on HBO.  After watching season 1, I bought the books.  I have always enjoyed the medieval and fantasy genre, and loved the television.  I was amazed by some of the things done on the show, and when I went to the HBO website to gain more information on the series, all the viewers were highly recommending getting the books.  And thus I did.<br /><br />  I was not disappointed by \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" in the least bit.  I believe it was beneficial to me, to have watched the television series first, as it allowed me to vividly bring up these characters as I was reading the book.  And as I continued reading, I must say what a fantastic job that the series did in casting the characters.  Tyrion, Jaime, Joffrey, Jon Snow, and all the others defeinitely came to life.  One thing that was interesting was that many of the characters in the book were \\"aged\\" for the television series.  I was confused many times during the HBO series with all of the characters, the Houses they came from, and how everyone was interrelated.  However, after reading the novel, everything was so much clearer, including the back stories of many of the characters, and the inner thoughts of them.  Some of the scenes that I enjoyed in the book better than the television series was where Bran was assaulted by the rogues in the forest, the dialogue between King Robert and Ned after the boar attack, Tyrion on the battleground by the river, and the scene declaring Robb, \\"King of the North\\".<br /><br />  The book is over 800 pages, and a relatively quick read.  I can see spots where readers will get slowed down, but the long list of characters do need to be elaborated on.  And of course, the ending of the book is absolutely fantastic, as it leads into the second novel.  The second season starts on HBO this Sunday, and I plan on reading the second book just behind watching each episode.  I will let you know how it goes.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a polished, smooth application which delivers what it claims - the ability to remotely take control of your computer, running the required (free) server.<br />There are clear limitations given the client side form factor.  Keyboard responses can lag slightly, and scrolling the window vs a screen vs rescaling can sometimes be difficult to do, you try to do one and another occurs. With some practice however this gets easier.  The program also has alternate mouse controls and scroll controls which can make this easier if you switch to them.<br /><br />Connection setup is easy, and while apparently not encrypted, it is at least password protected.  Both local area and remote via Internet connections are easily accessed and work identically except local connections, not surprisingly, show slightly faster responses.<br />When I want to trade mobility for ease of use, this is a great tool and allows me to just carry my Kindle Fire, but access (almost) any application on my office computer. (The exception are certain programs which don't run in well behaved windows, including ImageJ, and oddly enough, windows built in photo slideshow.)  Otherwise it works well, meaning for example you can remotely access Word and be able to edit and create documents using all of the full program features, not the reduced functions of QuickOffice or Docs to Go.<br />Highly recommended.  I don't use it every day, but when I do, it's extremely useful and well worth the cost.

Excremental acting matched slightly by the usual directing-by-numbers from Soderburgh, which followed a daft screenplay exhibiting the usual Hollywood cliches and stereotypical characters.<br />Why waste money on this claptrap when you can commute by train or bus and spend an idle hour or so watching those morons who insist on yawning or coughing without covering their mouths?

It's amazing and original.

B004LDLI2Q|2.0|Mein Kampf gets the mandatory first star for existing, and the second star for being of historical value.<br /><br />After doing a great deal of reading on World War II, and having known all my life that Adolf Hitler wrote this book before / on his way to taking the reins of Germany, I figured it would be worth it to see just what it was that gained him so many followers and such a bottomless fund of royalties to fund his political ambitions.<br /><br />Even Hitler's Minister of Armaments Production Albert Speer said he couldn't bother to finish the book...  I guess that says something.<br /><br />The book is not a horrible read in terms of style...  And make no mistake, Hitler pretty much lays out what he is going to do when he comes to power.  So it's pretty difficult to imagine how Mein Kampf could have existed for years and yet the mass of the German Reich was shocked upon the discovery of the ultimate treatment of 'the Jewish Question.'<br /><br />Anyway, Hitler's logic is completely untenable.  But it is also presented in a way that I could see as very convincing upon a weak mind.<br /><br />For the first 50 pages or so, Hitler only makes one glancing reference to Jewry.  But right after that point in the book, as if it had been painful to hold it in for even that long, he explodes in a nonstop tyrade against Jews in a way that is so over the top that it almost makes for comedy now.<br /><br />Hitler provides premise A, then presents fact B, distracts the reader for a minute or two and then proudly exclaims conclusion Z.<br /><br />That said, several of his observations on the nature and structure of politics are on point and the book serves to flesh out the social climate of Germany in the early 20th Century quite colorfully.<br /><br />I certainly don't want to be on record as recommending that anybody read Mein Kampf, but it makes for an interesting study in how an enormous number of people were politically seduced in an era before modern human rights.  I guess it's kind of like reading Von Clausewitz or Sun Tzu...if they had rabies.
0061906220|5.0|James Dean is an artist who has been painting Pete the Cat in Atlanta, Georgia (and around the country) for a decade. Eric Litwin is a former classroom teacher who is now winning awards for his special combination of music and storytelling.<br />Together, they created this incredible book.<br />In it, Pete the Cat has shoes he loves. These shoes get abused. Does Pete cry about this, though? Goodness no! He keeps walking along, and singing his song.<br /><br />The story uses repetitive phrasing, simple words and call and response to make a wonderful experience for both reader and listener, along with lush and unique artwork. Concepts conveyed are very basic colors (white, red, blue, brown), listening skills (the listener has to pay attention to know when to answer the color that Pete's shoes turn and when to say \\"goodness no!\\") and that little things aren't catastrophes.<br /><br />For me? I love this book. I get bored reading the same book again and again to my children. I rarely get bored reading Pete. I'm always discovering new little bits that James Dead added into the illustrations, and singing along with the story can be quite joyous.<br /><br />My kids? My [3 year old] daughter loves this story. She gets excited for the call and response portions, and she pays attention to the (admittedly very simple) story because of this.<br />My [3 year old] son is a whole other level, though. He has special needs, and this book speaks loudly and comfortingly to him. He will sit and reread it by himself for an hour or more. I don't know if it's the repetition, the music, the illustrations, the concepts, or just a beautiful combination that engages him, but engage it does.<br />His preschool teacher also reports that his entire classroom of special needs children feel exactly the same.<br /><br />We can't get enough of Pete the Cat in this house, and have spread the love to many others.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are definitely the successor to the old faithful Sony MDR-V6.  Those who assume the MDR-V600's are the successor are definitely making a mistake if they go that route.<br /><br />The only difference between the MDR-V6 and the MDR-7506 is the frequency response spec.  The V6 range was claimed to be 5Hz - 30kHz.  The range of the 7506 is listed as 10Hz - 20kHz.  However, since the human ear cannot hear sounds below 27Hz nor above about 18kHz, this difference is moot.<br /><br />The MDR-V6 and this successor, the MDR-7506, are easily the best headphones I've ever used (and I've used many), and they are both the professional standard by which all others are measured, especially when considering the price.  If you're looking for headphones, don't hesitate to buy these.  You will not be disappointed in the least.

They desecrated the movie with some really lame new content and comic book art. The killed the great flow this movie originally had. If you are a fan of the movie, do yourself a favor and stay very clear of this new version of the movie. I would have been satisfied if it came with the original AND the new version, but it does not. I wish I could get my money back. It's just like Lucas adding new bad elements to his Star Wars movie.

B00012L786|5.0|I first saw this movie on tv sometime in the 1970's. I'd previously seen several Sam Fuller films, MERRILL'S MAURADERS in the theater; STEEL HELMET, FIXED BAYONETS, BARON OF ARIZONA and 40 GUNS on tv. I liked them all, very much. So when the magazines FILM COMMENT and SIGHT AND SOUND began running articles on \\"Film Noir\\" at this time I started scanning the TV GUIDE for such films, catching D.O.A., THE BIG COMBO, and, of course, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET.<br /><br />Now maybe my hopes were too high based on my viewing of past Sam Fuller films but, hyped up as I was, I found this film to be somewhat average, better than most, but nothing really great. I thought the \\"commie\\" stuff rather dated. I thought this a lesser Fuller film and filed it away in the backlog of my memory.<br /><br />Flash forward into the 2000's. Film Noir has gained a reputation and lots of attention. It has a big following and many films of the \\"genre?\\" are seeing pristine dvd releases. I've been buying them up and enjoying them, bathing in the fatalism that reflects my own life...and yet, always putting off the CRITERION dvd of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET. After all, I've seen it before and know it's some dated commie movie of no great shakes.<br />Then the local BORDERS announced that it was closing it's doors and I went in and couldn't leave PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET on the shelf at 60% off. So I bought it, took it home and let it sit in a stack for months. Then I got the Film Noir urge, and what the heck, popped it into the dvd player...<br /><br />WOW!!!<br />It was like I had never seen this film before! The image was so crystal clear with such great depth range! Better than it probably appeared in theaters. I sat rivited. I was mesmerized. This was indeed Sam Fuller's greatest film. Widmark was in top form, matching NIGHT AND THE CITY. Thelma Ritter should have won an Oscar. The film should have won several Oscars. Everything was flawless; direction, acting, cinematography, music score.<br />What happened?<br />Was this the same film that I saw on tv 40 years ago?<br />Back then I saw something a little above average.<br />Today I saw a visionary work of art.<br />Maybe I've changed, but most of what I liked or disliked 40 years ago pretty much holds true today, and yet...<br />Maybe it's CRITERION's flawless print of this film that has me seeing this film really for the first time ever, seeing it as it was meant to be seen and experienced.<br />...all in all, this is the perfect example of a truly talented director taking pulp fiction material and turning it into a work of art.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is that this CRITERION dvd presentation looks better than the day the film was released. If you've seen this noir classic in the distant past then you've never really seen it at all. Buy this dvd and experience PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET again, for the first time ever...<br /><br />Super-Highly recommended!
B007JRU2UK|4.0|I wanted to see The Descendants from the second I knew it was directed by Alexander Payne. Sideways and Election are two of my favorite comedies.

There are several subplots in the beginning, but Payne is competent at tying them together in the end. I really liked this movie.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|Marrying the worst of 30s depression a la shacks and backwoods poverty to post-apocalyptic reality TV is the major premise of this film.Set in a dystopian post-America known as Panem,where an elite preside over a starving working class,and annually forces each of its 12 districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games,a brutalised televised tournament,where they all battle to the death for the enjoyment of their oppressors.This franchise based on the 3 Collins' novels is destined to fill the gap left by the Twilight series.<br /><br />The reason it will do this is because of Jennifer Lawrence.Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen volunteers as a tribute to spare her younger sister Prim. Katniss has developed prodigious hunting skills while faring for her family.This character is not far from her role as Ree in Winter's Bone,both characters dragged into adulthood prematurely, having developed survivalist instincts to cope.Lawrence conveys strength,moral intensity and yet compassion.A face that launches a 1000 films or Joan of Arc?Katniss is plucked from Appalachian poverty and made over as a TV star.<br /><br />The film recalls Battle Royale,Rollerball and Running Man,though Ross takes the central conceit and plays it straight.Like a bird's wings the main elements open up and fly.It suggests only the lotteried contestants can briefly savour the delights of the elite before most of them die,while they are prepared in-house for the savagery that awaits them. Katniss realises she must play a game of charm to win sponsors as well as survive the battle for the fittest,even play a love game with Petaa,which becomes real.Her mentor is Haymich(Harrelson) an ex-winner alcoholic who also mentors Petaa,from District 12.Tucci is a foppish grotesque,the pre-bloodbath interviewer.<br /><br />The 1st part of the film(1 hour) builds the contestants up,coaches and primes them giving us bits of back-story for the 2nd part which is the fight to the death in the televisedarena.The film is impressively cast with many cameo parts for successful mature actors like Harrelson, Tucci(blue bouffant hairdo),Sutherland and Banks,who all play their parts with professional seriousness. But the spotlight is on the younger actors,who have acted in only one or two films up to now.The cinematography captures the agitated nature of the bloodsport in the sylvan forest with hand-held cameras,the blood is downplayed to 12 A, to reach a mass audience,so the gore is often soft-pedalled,off camera or hazy.This is a blockbuster and it works.
B004EPYZXK|5.0|i think most reviewers kind of missed the real selling point of this movie. the selling point is not some 'Blair Witch' contrivance, but space exploration and NASA itself. i was suprised at how many people didn't even note how accurate and realistic it's portrayl of NASA in the 1970's is. oh but i forgot. it seems that viewers these days are more enamored with the catoonish, comic book portrayls of space technology in overgrandized kiddie fare like 'Avatar' or 'Star Trek'. personally i prefer realism in my science fiction.<br />  realistic science fiction is often overlooked in favor of fantasy. i prefer movies like '2001' or the original 'Andromeda Strain'. at least those films are plausible and don't make you giddy with a over active imagination.<br />  'Apollo 18' was somewhat predictable in it's soryline, but not in it's art direction and concept. instead of being about the future like the 'Alien' film, this film is about the past and therefore a period piece. it even has photography that sucessfully duplicates a lot of NASA footage. George Lucas acheived a very similar effect with his award winning film 'American Graffiti when he purposely used cheap film stock to duplicate the effect of low budget, drive-in movies of the early sixties. photography in 'Apollo 18' is used to similar effect, and with stunning result.<br />  this was a very impressive work of current cinema. unfortunately people these days don't want realism in Sci Fi. Sci Fi author Ray Bradbury once took serious note of that sad fact. i was actaully kind of alarmed at how many people failed to understand the realism and the attempt to educate in this compelling and interesting homage to America's space program. even if this does incite goverment paranoia somewhat.

0439023483|4.0|I had recognized Collins from a previous series, \\"Gregor the Overlander,\\" and was frankly expecting more of the same. Well, nah, that impression was banished when I read the book. She had improved, streamlining her writing and nuancing her 'teenager' archetype to a more believable... teenager. She kept the themes of stress and protection in times of war, but rearranged it to a somehow more fantastic but less cartoony portrayal of a dystopian world.<br /><br />I don't think Hunger Games is a social commentary, or focused on violence. It's a story about revolution. Interestingly, it does not tell you what to think about this. The writing is called 'compelling' because it rockets you through the book, easy to read but not really that impressive prose-wise. Keeping nicely within the confines of the rough character Katniss, you discover the world of Panem and it's glamorous, cruel Capitol from a biased viewpoint that seems authentic even if it's sometimes annoying.<br /><br />Katniss, as a character, is cynical. Katniss will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means pandering to the Capitol's wishes. If she fails, or protests, she will die, her family will die, her entire district will suffer in her place. Panem is a totalitarian trap. Good enough premise.<br /><br />The Hunger Games narrative style makes no effort to explain itself and bluntly moves on without reflection. It was nice to have the author not spelling out the morals of her story, and it allowed me free reign to picture every scenario and build my curiosity of the world as opposed to, having the author shove his/her ideological lessons down my throat.<br /><br />The subplot of romance between Peeta and Katniss is awkwardly and painfully executed, though I can see the idea she was trying to execute. She pulls through on pure plot desperation and guts alone to be honest. Luckily, romance is subplot and subplot only.<br /><br />The buildup and execution of the Revolution is one of the most efficient I've ever seen in a book series. The buildup is slow enough to not seem convenient, it takes on an ambitious project of showing (not telling) what it takes to start and end a war, and that includes nixing some happy endings.<br /><br />Hunger Games is a pretty neat story with cool characters and decent writing. It is very compelling! What's not to like?<br /><br />Well, actually, the prose wasn't all that engaging, but it was a mature, developed style though simplistic. I also have issues with how some Arena rules aren't really explored or how Katniss doesn't have to face the dilemma of killing Rue, for example. But besides that, I mean, it's way better than the usual fare and completely immersed me in her world. The book set out what it wanted to do, and I'm not going to nitpick about pandering to my interests.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. I recommend  this book because it is a page turner and once you start reading it you won't want to put it down.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I promised myself I'd give this album a full 3 listens before I review it. That's because I didn't like the choice of singles. And in the span of two days, it's happened. This seems to be quite a grandiose welcome back for Madge. She wasn't kidding when she tweeted that she wanted to sweat during the recording process. Perfect album to work out to. The beats are bass-pounding, sounds are all over the place, intimacy is thrown in too. Unlike 2008's Hard Candy, it's like \\"Madonnas just want to have fun,\\" done right.<br /><br />My standouts:<br />Girl Gone Wild: Benny Benassi. I could tell because the opening bass sounds kinda like his remix for Celebration. But, it gets the job done as the opener, and does set a middle-ground tone for the first 5/6ths of the album.<br />Gang Bang: I was very surprised the first time I heard the outro to this song. But after quite a few listens, this is one powerful song, and I adore those deep vocals she contributes, eventually increasing towards the end. The emotion and darkness-filled desire fills up this song. I'd be very interested in seeing this done live.<br />I'm Addicted: I'm addicted to this song. This one is in your face and almost completely techno, and while that can mean unoriginality, somehow Madge manages to bring some fresh tunes to the simple bass thump here. I simply can't stop playing this song. Plus who can get that MDNA climax out of their head? Not me!<br />Turn Up the Radio: Should be a third single, and if she wants to continue with the high energy stuff as singles. Feel-good lyrics, feel good synths, this one just screams \\"sunroof open, highway driving, I need to feel good NOW.\\"<br />Some Girls: I was afraid with the previews on youtube that lyrics and some of the depth that Madge sometimes brings might be lost in the sounds of the album. This song kind of exemplifies that for me. Hard hitting sounds, and lots of layers, but this song works it. I think this is the song that made me start to like the electronicsonund.<br />Love Spent: Fabulous, a love ballad waiting to happen, but transformed into the electronica sound. And wait for the breakdown in the middle of the song when it goes down an octave: sends my emotions up every single time.<br /><br />Oh, but wait, it's tracks 11 and 12 that steal the show for me. Like I said, this album is very electronic. So it's hard to hear Madge herself when she's under so many layers. But she tones it down for the end, thankfully. So, the Golden Globe winning \\"Masterpiece\\" and subtle and longing ballad \\"Falling Free,\\" shine with Madge's vocals being the forefront and very simple, intimate production. I dare say they're the best part of the standard edition and provide a very nice step back from the overflowing energy of the earlier portion of the disc. Good choice putting them at the end, since they drag the energy down, but trust me, it's worth it.<br /><br />Okay, now for the deluxe edition: Beautiful Killer seems standard to me, it has grown on a bit as time goes on, but I F---ed Up is brilliant. Nice production, sing-a-long lyrics (not for the kids obviously) for when the time is right, short run time, YES. B-Day song is one of those novelties (like I'm Going Bananas from I'm Breathless). Best Friend, too much production though I love the concept of the song. I am not a Party Rocker although I am a college student, so the remix of GMAYL did nothing for me. I don't even think she'd use it on her tour (and she LOVES remixes of her songs on tour). Ugh. Anyway, lucky me, I bought the iTunes special edition (the one on sale for 3 days only), and so I get an absolute takeaway song: the Acoustic Version of Love Spent. Remember I said it was a love ballad waiting to happen? Here, it shines. Stripped down production, acoustic guitars, some extra vocals, and the emotion of wanting that love to be spent on you: ALL HERE. I hope y'all caught that deal (it was 9.99 for 18 tracks), because this song is worth the entire Deluxe Edition price initself.<br /><br />So this is my first taste of catching Madge when she puts out something new after finally catching on to her after Hard Candy. She's forced me to acquire a taste for electronica now, and I am liking it. The bass is good for studying, good for partying or good to lose yourself in. The lyrics aren't something to die for, but it's a feel-good album. And I can go to Jill Scott in the soul section for that. The production is superb, if not at times a bit too much for my tastes, but I'll get over it. The fact is, I'm enjoying getting to know the intricacies in every song, like the whispered vocals in Gang Bang or the prayer-like bridge in I'm a Sinner. And when I like to go that in-depth to every song, I deem an album a worthy purchase. I need a few more listens before I fall in love with this album, but for now: four stars. A solid effort and a welcome return for Madge. I fully expect a lot of these songs to get rotations in clubs without being released as singles. But everyone knows where these songs will absolutely shine: her upcoming tour.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. It didn't even take me a day to finish.<br />At first I wasn't sure it was a book I'd enjoy since it's more for young adults, however once I started reading I couldn't stop. The story catches you from page one and just keeps you going because you have to find out what happens next.<br />Loved the characters, the setting, the whole story. A great read for anyone of any age.
B006L4MX0Y|1.0|I really can't say much more except that this movie completely sucks.  I watched it because Quentin Tarantino endorsed it and I have literally lost some of the respect I had for him.  I honestly can't say one good thing about the movie.  It wasn't even good in a cheesy, cult way.  If that is what you are looking for then watch \\"Hobo With A Shotgun.\\". It is 100 times better than this movie.
0439023491|5.0|Loved it! Just like the first book of the series, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire grabs you from page one and you just can't put it down. It's exactly what I hoped it would be after reading the first book. Amazing!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just discovered the *Wool Omnibus* (books 1-5) and now I can't wait for *Wool 6*!<br /><br />I have to say right off the bat that I am a very picky reader.  I always want to give indie authors a chance, but have too often been disappointed when I have done so:  either the storyline is weak, the exposition is poor, the writing is average at best, the grammar and/or punctuation errors are distracting, or all of the above.  Hugh Howey's *Wool* is a WHOLE other indie animal.<br /><br />Howey's premise borders on brilliant--the kind of premise you wish you had thought of yourself and wonder how anyone did--but what's even better is that the writing is good enough to explain and describe that fascinating premise in a way that allows the reader to imagine it with ease.  A writer's inability to help the reader move into his or her \\"brave new world\\" and inhabit it is all too common in indie science fiction/dystopian literature in my experience.  Not so here.  Howey's silo world comes alive for the reader and I was sucked in to the point of dreaming about it two nights running and staying up the last night until 11:30 p.m. (and I have to get up at 4:45 a.m., so that's saying a lot!).<br /><br />Howey's writing is clear and to the point, advancing the plot with ease, but it is also descriptive and, when necessary, even poetic.  His characters are real people and--without giving too much away!--I felt a real sense of loss when some of them met their demise.  Juliette's various ordeals had my heart rate going up because I knew (from earlier in the book) that Howey was willing to sacrifice his characters.  Plot-wise, it was almost impossible to get ahead of the author--I would imagine what might happen next and was almost always wrong!<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful read.  I'm delighted that there will be more volumes of *Wool*, and can assure the author that I will be right there reading them as he produces them. Now off to read the rest of his books!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is most definitely my favorite book in the trilogy.  We see so much character development in Christian and Ana. The plot truly thickens.<br /><br />I started the book already wanting more, after the way book 1 ended, and that feeling did not let up through the entire book.  It was one exciting thing after the other. It's hard to write about without giving anything away, but if you were hooked on the first book, you most definitely want to move on and read book 2.
0140120416|5.0|I have been learning Russian for almost 2 years, and during this time I have tried several books. Moreover, I have worked with tutors, I have attended courses, I have worked on my own etc.<br /><br />Many books I have tried were either books for tourists which were too simple to teach essentials of Russian or they were too complicated and assumed that you already know much about Russian. Finally I have bought this book as a last try and I have found out that this was the book I have been looking for.<br /><br />Firstly, this book is written by a British (not a Russian native) professor who teaches Russian and the author is well aware of the hard points for Russian learning English speakers (well, he already walked on this way). I noticed that many books written by Russian natives keep a high level and for a non-Russian speaker it is very easy to get lost and finally the inevitable end: to give up. Nicholas Brown starts from the basics, and makes everything clear. It is nice to see that whenever a question arises in your mind, you find the answer just in the next paragraph.<br />Moreover, the structure of the book is very well planned. One of the hardest things in Russian is padezhs, and this book spends one or more chapter on each padezh. Examples are very well selected.<br /><br />Finally, I would suggest to pair this book with Brian Kemple's Essential Russian Grammar, which is a very good supplementary book. Russian is a very hard language indeed but if you have these two books, you will surely have less difficulties.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was hard for me to get in to Book 3 at the beginning.  There were some weird flashbacks and I had a bit of trouble keeping track.  Wanting to know how it would all end up though, I plugged on, and soon enough I was as wrapped up in the story as I had been previously.<br /><br />I didn't necessarily agree with some of the twists and turns; I didn't think they fit in as well with the original story.  I did enjoy it though right up until the end, as well as the epilogue and the bonus content that was featured.  The trilogy tied up nicely, and I will miss it now that I'm done.
0439023513|5.0|I think that all the other people who reviewed this last book and gave it a poor review were expecting a fairytale or some kind of love story just like another reviewer said. Well, lets face it, war is not pretty. It doesn't usually lead to happy endings and there are always casualties (mentally and phisically). So to expect katniss to walk away without any scars was not realistic. I think thats what the author wanted to portray. People now adays are so distanced from war that they dont know what it is really like. People and machines will be used as pawns to achieve the end desired. We have seen people and kids sacrificed in war before. It is horrible but true. In the end of this story, i grieved and cried with Katniss but i read on and got through it just as she did. I think it was a powerful ending to this story and a happy ending considering all that had happened. I'm not sure how they are going to portray it all in a PG-13 movie though. We shall see!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say that I was a little bit nervous about starting this book, not sure that a BDSM story line was for me, but I am so glad I did.  My heart was in my throat the entire time I was reading, and I could hardly put the book down to go to work.  This isn't just a story about kinky sex and whips and chains.  It's a story of two people falling in love even though they are vastly different.  The sex is steamy, but it was more about their attraction to each other, how one couldn't get the other out of their head.  I read through the series fairly quickly, and am now reading it for a second time, slower, and enjoying their relationship development.<br /><br />Just a note, you will tire quickly of Ana's inner goddess and subconscious duking it out, and swooning, and doing laps, and whatever else the author has them doing.  This was a part of the story I could have done without.  Other repetitive things: \\"Holy Crap!\\"  \\"Holy Cow!\\" **burning grey eyes*, and the opening of telltale \\"foil packets'.<br /><br />The story itself is worth it though, and I recommend it highly.
0439023521|5.0|It has been a while since i have found a series that was so engaging. I read all three books in less than 4 days! They are well written and even thouh i wanted to skip through sections just to know what would happen next, I wanted to read every word of the books. The underlying message, morality and humanity issues confronted are compelling. I have recommended this book to everyone i know. A must read. It's got a little bit of everything.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is just as good as the others in this series.  The characters are well described and \\"real\\".  Continuing to discover what happens to the characters and the addition of new characters keeps this book flowing.  Knowing that the timelines of this book and the previous book are overlapped helps to enable you to follow the action.  I can't wait for the new installment!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I highly recommend this trilogy. It is very easy to get totally enthralled in the characters.  I read the entire trilogy in less than a week. I just couldn't put it down.  The BDSM was really a back seat the development of the characters.  Don't judge this book based on that.  It is worth the read.

1402766785|2.0|I purchased this book for the reference library at an art school where I teach.<br />I should have looked over an actual copy of the book before ordering it online based  on reputation alone.<br />I was significantly disappointed in the visual content and presentation. Perhaps the drawing examples are meant to look like pencil or charcoal drawings on paper with some \\"tooth\\". The execution, however, results in page after page of weak illustrations containing, in many cases, little discernable line variety or emphasis. I find myself wondering if the digital reproduction process over-simplified the original drawings. Or if a sheet of cheese cloth was placed over the drawings prior to scanning them. Many of the drawings have little \\"presence\\" on the page and students found them difficult to work from. Examples of suggesting form and dimensions contain shading marks of the same \\"weight\\" as the other marks in the drawing. This proved too unclear and confusing to teach with (I'd use the examples to supplement classroom drawing demonstrations).<br />The basic ideas represented here are  comprehensive and quite sound. However, the layout is uninspired and the quality of the illustrations does no justice to the strength of the text. I tried using it, and asked students and other instructors for their feedback. The final conclusion was- NOT RECOMMENDED.

B006MQRLSA|5.0|This movie is well put together with strong acting from both its leading actor and its supporting actor.

One of the best films of the year.

0312641893|4.0|I was torn about whether to rate this book 3 or 4 stars, but settled on 4 because it was a very addictive read and I blew through Cinder in two days (and I'm a slow reader).<br /><br />What I enjoyed about Cinder was the characterization of the protagonist. Meyer built upon the situation of Charles Perrault's Cinderella, but Cinder isn't just an unappreciated servant to her stepmother and stepsisters, as she is in the original fairytale. Cinder has personality and specific interests--she's a mechanic, the best in New Beijing, and a cyborg to boot. Particularly endearing is Cinder's android, Iko, who has a \\"faulty\\" personality chip that makes her sassy and opinionated. Iko had some of the best lines in the book and added comic relief to scenes that might have otherwise been too sad. She kind of reminded me of Robin Williams' character in Bicentennial Man.<br /><br />On the downside, I found Cinder to be quite a predictable book, but not because it's a retelling of the classic fairytale. Meyer adds and changes many of the story's elements so that it's mainly the themes that link it to Cinderella. What made Cinder so predictable was that by page 130, it was obvious where the plot would go, what secrets each character was hiding, and how it would come together at the climax. If things had been just a little more carefully veiled, it could have taken the reader longer to foresee the trajectory of the plot and elevated the novel. It always is a bit disappointing when things feel so obvious after reading just a quarter of the book. Nevertheless, Cinder is an addictive read. Meyer writes at a fast but even pace that keeps the reader interested (even if they only want to see if their early predictions were correct).<br /><br />I also found some aspects of the setting confusing. Cinder is set in New Beijing, 126 years after the end of World War IV. Because it's set in China I pictured Cinder as a young Chinese woman, only to find out that she is actually European, and then that she isn't European either. I'm still not entirely sure what Cinder looks like, except that her hair is brown and doesn't hold a curl. The writing suggests that the disruption caused by the war resulted in this global cultural melting pot, and Cinder is a hodgepodge of Asian, European, and African customs/names/symbols/etc. It's an interesting thought, but in Cinder it was a bit disorienting and hard to picture.<br /><br />Cinder ends with a cliffhanger that will definitely motivate readers to pick up the second book in the series. It's a fun ride, as long as you don't mind a bit of cultural ambiguity and a predictable plot.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I got the case with my fire and it is the best Accessory I have ever purchased for an electronic device. My only suggestion is do not get the white one. The white gets so dirty and I have only had it for less than two months. The stand works well, never had a problem with it. The fold over cover removes most of the finger prints. I suggest this case to anyone I know with a Kindle Fire. Definitely a must have!!

B0076NAWWA|5.0|Wow, what an album. I haven't been this impressed with a Mike Portnoy offering since Scenes From A Memory, the album that forever changed the way I look at music. This album is so much more than the sum of its parts...a great singer, a great drummer, a great bass player, etc. The point is that these people are great songWRITERS, aside from their individual abilities on their respective instruments. This album runs the gamut from metal to sugar-pop, and sounds great at each step along the way. Steve Morse's guitar solos are ethereal, particularly on the track \\"Kayla\\". I was walking home from work and when that solo kicked in, I had a grin on my face that lasted till the end of the song. Portnoy is somewhat restrained but classy, adding amazing grooves and never once \\"overplaying\\" or showing off on this album. This is the side project I always hoped he'd be a part of. Adrenaline Mob didn't do anything for me, as in my opinion it was really just decent nu-metal with an amazing singer. This however is the sum of many influences, and this album has something for absolutely everyone who is a fan of music. Congrats Mike and co, and thank you for the best release yet in 2012.
B003YBUSMW|3.0|May 2012 Update:<br /><br />Having logged hundreds of hours on this wheel, I have to express disappointment in the flimpsy plastic pedals. Both are broken now in the corners where it hits the bottom stop. I stomped on them too hard when I hadn't yet learned to finese the gas and braking. However, it should be sturdy enough for a novice like me, especially in view of the fact that I was not wearing shoes. Fortunately, the pedals still hang on and work.<br /><br />Pros: Accurate Steering/Solid Feel Steering Wheel/Good Response from Pedal Travel.<br /><br />Cons: Flimpsy pedals/No Force Feeback.<br /><br />I am reducing the rating from 4 to 3.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a decent wheel and pedal set out there for XBox 360? Is there anything in the works?<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I have used this now for about three months. Everything works as advertised. Steering wheel is sturdy and the pedals are reasonable (more on that later). Used it with Forza 3 and 4 mostly. It is a definitely improvement from using the controller.<br /><br />The Wheel:<br />It has table clamps and a lap rest. I use the latter because the coffee table I have is too low for the table mount. Surprisingly, once I get used to it, the lap rest works fine. It's a good size, heavy enough to stay put, and not so heavy that it bothers me.<br />Steering is accurate and I learned to finese it so that I can stay on the racing lines accurately (when I do it well), something that I just could not do with the controller. It centers nicely so that during long straights, the car tracks true with no steering input at 200 mph.<br />The peddle shifters work well, responding quickly. I have not tried the stick shifter.<br /><br />The Pedals<br />There are only two; so clutching is impossible. Besides, the gas and brake pedals are not positioned well for heel-toe; it wouldn't work for the diehard fan anyway. Other than that, the long travel is great, especially for the go pedal. After getting used to it, I can manage those long curves and make fine adjustments to achieve optimal speed, passing the AI opponents even on \\"hard\\" setting. The brake pedal also works fine, except I must have broken something when I stomped on it too hard. It now feel loose at the bottom of the travel. It stills works well but feels a bit insecure at the bottom stop. I guess it should be more sturdy to withstand abuse.<br /><br />Overall, the only con I can think of is no feedback. It does not affect driving accuracy but I heard that the best feedback wheels tell you when the front wheels are nearing its limit. Without feedback, the only way I know whether I'm too fast in a corner is visually. It'd be great if I can *feel* the front starting to lose traction before I *see* it. But then this is academic because the acclaimed Logitech wheel and pedal set does not work with XBox 360 -- sigh ...<br /><br />I searched high and low and found no other comparable product available for new.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Review:<br />In the Hunger Games, the rules are very simple. One boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts, a total of twenty-four tributes, produces one winner. But last year's games ended quite differently, due to a handful of berries? So now, despite all odds both district twelve tributes, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are alive! Katniss should be overjoyed, right? She gets to return to her family and her very close friend, Gale! What is there to worry about? A lot. Ever since the train, Peeta has completely abandoned her, and it seems like she has lost him forever! Then there is Gale. He has been distant and just plain weird since her return home from the games. But Katniss has much bigger things to worry about because those meager handful of berries may have saved Peeta and herself, but tf may have also had the complete opposite effect on the Capitol. With whispers of a rebellion in the air, Katniss seems to have much bigger issues than boy troubles!<br /><br />To her displeasure, Katniss seems to have added kindling to a big flame that she didn't mean to start! But what's even scarier than the fact that this fire may be too big for her to put out, is the feeling she has that she shouldn't extinguish the flame of rebellion! Now, it's critical for her and Peeta to prove that they are \\"madly in love\\" on their victory tour, or their whole world could be turned upside down! Can Katniss and Peeta handle it?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has done something many authors have failed to do! She has written a sequel to the amazing Hunger Games, which not only does it justice, but is just as thrilling and addictive as the first! Katniss may be \\"Catching Fire\\" for a Capitol Rebellion, but Suzanne Collins may have started an even bigger \\"Hunger Games\\" flame!<br /><br />I was a major Twilight fan, and some could say a little obsessive, I'm sure. I mean, I did read the series about eight times! But these books have completely changed my opinion! I am no longer Team Edward, but Team Peeta now! Sorry Stephanie Meyers, but I think Collins' Hunger Games may be even bigger than Twilight!<br /><br />Educational Value:  5 out of 5 - This book is probably a book that is more  an entertainment read than an educational one, but there are two things that I have learned. One wasn't from the book's context, but the author's way of writing! Suzanne Collins is officially my role model as an author! She did an amazing job  adding just the right amount of suspense, love triangles, and action. She has a gift for writing that I would dream of having! The other is that with these novels, Collins has brought not only entertainment, but love for reading as well!<br /><br />Entertainment Value: 5 out of 5 - This book was amazing! It was so well written, I could picture everything that was happening! Suzanne Collins has a way with words that just has them leaping off the page, that leaves you wondering and wanting more! I am in love with this series! Collins deserves renowned praise for not only The Hunger Games but for Catching Fire as well! Finding a sequel that is as good as the first novel is hard to do! Only an amazing author can capture a reader with similar features more than once! I not only praise the book itself, nor just the series itself, but Suzanne Collins as well!<br /><br />This review was first published on Kid's Corner @Kindle Nation Daily.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />@EbookBelleEdward, but Team Peeta now!

B007N6NGYG|5.0|Downloaded cause I saw great graphics and when started to play it I was amazed at how fun it was.  Some are super easy, most of them are about right with a couple at the end that takes time trying to get.  Well worth the money and can't wait for them to install other tracks to complete.  So far it only has two sections to play but still a lot of play time.  Would recommend this to anyone of any age.
1451673442|5.0|I haven't usually been someone to go for new age philosophies and \\"the power of positive thinking\\" but this book makes me think, why not?<br /><br />Certainly remembering to be grateful for all the good things in one's life is a wonderful way to live. Whether it's bringing more good things or not, at the very least it is reminding me of all the good around me and making me happier and more cheerful throughout my day.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the book is that there are exercises for every day to increase your joy and gratitude (and, according to the book, even increase money and make wishes come true). I'm doing an exercise each day, as the book outlines, and I'm really enjoying it.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|There was a time when I thought this album was cool because it was heavy like the Ozzy albums but then to call the Dio albums soft would be a huge insult.  Over the years, my love for this album has never swayed but my understanding of why I liked it so much has.  I think it is just because it's a good slab of rock music.  I personally never understood people's problems with the sound.  I think it sounds great.  Its metal, its Black Sabbath...when were they ever the kings of production.  In fact almost every Sabbath album had a different sound to it.  Do we really want a band like Sabbath to be overproduced...have you heard The Seventh Star album.  Thats over-producing and they still messed up the sound on that too.  I love the way this album sounds, its very raw, but very powerful.  The heavy loud songs punch you in the face and the lighter songs play out beautifully.  Don't ask me my favorite songs, for that I'm partial to all of them.  I did always wish this album had less intros and a couple more songs.  But other then that, I love it.  The deluxe edition does almost nothing to the sound quality of the Born Again album.  It does however alter the live tracks, I used to have the bootleg.  If you've heard of the tracks from the often bootlegged show they have on here, you know the bootleg version was extremely bass heavy.  I loved it.  It worked.  It still sounded great and you had a pounding bass track and Geezer can play.  Unfortunately for me, this version lowers the bass to almost inaudable levels.  Much like many Sabbath/metal albums, Geezers bass becomes a background instrument.  It is cool to hear the songs this way now, if you never heard the bootleg before.  Then the sound is totally proper and you won't have a problem with it.  But don't expect an improvement in the live performances.  It really just sounds like the bootleg version with the bass lowered, it doesn't sound any clearer.  They cut out some live parts too, there was a long intro to zero the hero, that is gone.  The Fallen and Stonehenge bonus tracks were good, I would have liked if they tried to fit the Trashed/Zero The Hero radio edit on there, there is a vinyl promo out there with a radio edit of Trashed/Zero The Hero, would have been cool to have that on there.  Overall, I think if you wanted Born Again, Deluxe Edition is perfectly acceptable.  Audio wise something tells me this album isn't fixable, if it was, they would have fixed it.  I think Iommi and Gillan and the rest of them are just talking for the sake of talking.  Have you heard Ian Gillan's redo of \\"trashed\\" on his solo album \\"Gillan's Inn\\" from 2006.  That sounds no better production wise.  I'm no sound expert but if all the calls for a remix and remaster go unheeded and a 2006 re-recording sounds no better (I actually thought it sounded worse) maybe it isn't the production.  Maybe its the music, maybe it just doesn't want to mix.  I don't know, I don't really care.  Born Again is a fantastic album for metal and for Sabbath.

0547258305|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book I couldn't wait to get home to read. And when I say that, I don't mean it as a quick thought of wanting. I was literally itching to stretch out and finish it, rushing through my daily routine, trying to get everything done so my easily distracted thoughts could focus solely on this book.<br /><br />The story takes place in a land of seven kingdoms, including massive fairy tale castles, princes and princesses, kings and queens, secrets and magic. Every so often, a child is born; this child grows into eyes of two different colors ~ they possess, or more accurately, are graced with  an extraordinary quality that sets them apart from the norm. In Katsa's case, she can kill any man that crosses her path, maim him with a flick of her wrist, and is used to do so by her king. Until she meets Po, who allows her to see that her strength isn't only held in her physical abilities.<br /><br />Of course, the plot drives the story, and does so well. Every action the characters take is based on one certainty: words dipped in lies will kill them and those they love if they don't destroy the speaker of those words first. However, I've always believed the characters create the plot, and as a character-driven reader, I couldn't have been more satisfied.<br /><br />The credibility of the characters is astounding. As you read, you can see their facial expressions, hear the tone in their voice, and experience their emotions. Katsa is everything I could want in a heroine. She's strong, determined, and fiercely independent, qualities which, in her case, could be seen as both strengths and weaknesses. She refuses to rely on anyone or anything but her own sharp senses, afraid that dependence would cause her to lose herself. Katsa's relationship with Po arouses this deep conflict within her, the desire of her heart battling with her need to belong only to herself. What makes Katsa so admirable in my eyes is that she refuses to give up on herself in order to love. Her flaw, at first, is that she believes you can't have one without the other, but she soon learns that love does not mean losing yourself ~ in fact, she discovers that it makes her whole, gives her even more strength, and reveals honorable truths about herself she was blind to and never could have imagined.<br /><br />The pace of Graceling is quick but not rushed. From the first chapter, the reader is immersed in action and mystery as the book begs for questions and leaves the reader plowing forward for answers. Nothing is ever simple. The characters face obstacles not easily overcome, whether it is from outside sources or within themselves, giving readers constant reasons to ponder.<br /><br />As a reader, I was never left wanting as I turned page after page, unable to stop.<br /><br />Verdict ~ *Highly Recommend*<br /><br />Happy Reading Everyone :)<br /><br />~ Keely ~o love.

1612130283|5.0|This may not be great literature, but it is a really good read. It gets to the emotion behind things and presents the characters in a way that absorbs you into it. I found myself at work thinking about the characters, their personalities, etc. I highly recommend the entire trilogy.

B007IQX1G4|5.0|If you don't like watching movies with main characters you don't like, watch something else.<br />It starts off boring, and seemed to be a boring comedy that simply made fun of every day life being messy.  But then it kicks in with the alcoholism and craziness and gets more entertaining.  Then it becomes moving.  It basically goes from funny (at least tries) to sad and then to moving.  All in all, this movie was a few bucks and I was compelled to watch it.  I would have been upset if it was ten bucks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, I downloaded the free sample and was hooked. I've read this one and the second one so far, and neither of them has once disappointed me. It's one of those books that you can barely put down because you don't want the story to continue without you. The characters are so deep and you can't help but feel for them. I found myself jumping out of my seat, yelling at the book, and crying all at the same time. Amazing.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i dont want to give anything away...so i will sum it up like this....days after finishing this last in the series it continues to haunt my thoughts. and to those who say they dont like it i wonder how you expected a book with this subject matter to end. this book makes you think .... even the ending that so many have complained about. there is no higher compliment for a book really. and if youve read the other two.. is any bad review going to make you skip this one? its a great book! dont miss it...dont hesitate to read the trilogy
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love angry birds I wasn't very pleased that you have to pay 2.99 for it but it's worth it
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|All of the books are incredibly easy to read, sometimes a little too simplistic. The first book (The Hunger Games) is by far the best read. It's engaging, the characters are interesting, and the story moves at the perfect pace. The second book (Mockingjay) felt lazy; its the same story repeated. The third (Catching Fire) book took too long to develop and the characters were disconnected, and at times infuriating. Katniss, the protagonist, while previously brave and endearing is now annoying and perpetually complaining. I would still recommend buying the trilogy, it would hurt too much to not continue the story after the first book. Just be aware that the fury and pace of the third book dwindles as you read the other two.
B00756GKBA|1.0|The MacDonald of music just put out another MacMadonna. CD full of bad weak electronic sounds, poor lyrics and the weak voice of Madonna helped by studio sound effects. This woman is thinking more about making money. She is not worrying about the quality of her music. She is out there for easy cash. If you have a brain you don't buy or listen to her music. I don't know why she is refusing to MATURE HERSELF like her contemporaries have done. Madonna trying to be another Lady Gaga or another Britney Spears will not work for you (they are falling themselves). You are a mature women with kids. So do like Cyndi Lauper and others: GROW UP and starts making serious good MUSIC. Nothing more to say!
B003Y5H5B0|1.0|if they had titles it anything but 21 jump street maybe I could give it a better rating. However the casting was poor as well as the writing. Jonah hill is not a lead, he was fine in small roles like Grandmas Boy, 40 yr old virgin etc... But he can not carry a film, even one as bad as this. Waste of time. Dont buy a ticket or copy of the dvd.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok...but not great.  A little tedious in navigation and some of the games are just boring.  Giving it a 3 because it does pass the time.

B000HF0IIC|1.0|I began watching the Batman series starting with Tim Burton's 1989 film. The first two films were excellent, full of layered characters, surprisingly good dialogue, and satisfying action sequences. Even the city of Gotham looked good. This film, however, features groan-inducing dialogue, a completely incoherent plot, offensively fluorescent sets, and just generally bad acting. I would rather have watched Batman Returns a second time.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|Flying Colors is the self-titled debut album by the Prog Rock super group by the same name. Genre giants Neal Morse (keyboards, vocals), Mike Portnoy (drums, vocals), Dave LaRue (bass), Casey McPherson (vocals, guitar), and Steve Morse (guitar) joined together to, as their press release says, \\"to make new-fashioned music the old fashioned way . . . together, they create a unique fusion of vintage craftsmanship, contemporary music and blistering live performances\\".<br /><br />Boomerocity couldn't agree more with that statement.<br /><br />Wow!  This disc grabs you by the ears and takes you on a sonic roller coaster ride that leaves you blissfully exhausted when the final notes are played.  The opening bass riff on the first cut, Blue Ocean, immediate made me think of the great Jerry Scheff bass lines at the beginning of the Doors' L.A. Woman. The similarities are soon set aside as the incredibly lush, rich sounds that are distinctly Flying Colors can crashing through.  This tune gives you a very good idea of what you're in store for on this album.<br /><br />Following Blue Ocean is a great rocker entitled Shoulda Coulda Woulda and, in our opinion, is what you would get if you merged Queen and Deep Purple into one band.  This song definitely earns a place on the Boomerocity short list of favorites from this album.<br /><br />Another favorite is the complex, tightly written Kayla. Beautiful harmonies, addictive melodies, and soaring instrument lines gives the listener something different to focus on with each listen.<br /><br />One of the mellower and more thought provoking songs of the album is the beautiful Better Than Walking Away that deals with the complications that come from close relationships and how to deal with them. This one is definitely worth listening to closely multiple times.<br /><br />By far the most epic (and lengthy) song of the album is the last one, Infinite Fire, clocking in at exactly twelve minutes.  This song will definitely be a prog rockers delight. Intricate, variable in \\"speed\\", and very \\"Yes-meets-Mister Mister\\"-ish, this tune is the perfect end to a perfect album.<br /><br />If you're a prog rock fan or just wanting to broaden your listening horizons, Flying Colors is the perfect addition to your listening library.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comdelight.

B0076NAW48|5.0|Most people, when the think of the blues artists, will think of blues guitarists or vocalists.  Leave it to Rolling Stones keyboardist, Chuck Leavell, to broaden our knowledge of the genre by turning us all on to great and often little known blues piano gems from the past.<br /><br />And turn us on he does!<br /><br />This album came about in large part because of a suggestion made by Leavell's son-in-law, Steve Bransford, and we should be darn glad that he did because this disc is fun to listen to.  The CD pays homage and a thank you to early piano blues pioneers like Leroy Carr, Memphis Slim, Barrelhouse Buck McFarland, Otis Spann, Little Brother Montgomery, Charlie Spand, Charles Calhoun, Ray Charles, Skip James, Leola Manning, and Jesse James.  To paraphrase Leavell's intentions shared in the album's notes, this is his interpretation and treatment of these great blues tunes and not a replication of them.<br /><br />Listening to this album, the listener can almost smell the liquor, smoke and food that would waft from the honky-tonks, juke joints and barrel houses that was home to piano blues players.  Leavell's signature sound permeates the album.  His light touch on the keys - a tickling, if you will - has a way of bringing sounds and feelings out of 88 keys like no one else can.  While Chuck has help from well known and incredibly talented people, I'd pay extra to have this CD of just his piano work sans the other instruments, it's that great.<br /><br />Speaking of the help Chuck brought in on Back To The Woods, it will come as no surprise to hear that band mate, Keith Richards, plays acoustic guitar on Evening Train and electric guitar on Boots and Shoes along with John Mayer.  John Mayer also plays electric guitar on Wish Me Well.  Incidentally, both of these tunes are flagged as the top two Boomerocity favorites and have been worn out by continuous slaps of the repeat button.<br /><br />Other guests who might sound familiar to you are Randall Bramblett, Candi Staton, Col. Bruce Hampton, Davis Causey, and Danny Barnes.  Rounding out the band are Tom Ryan on baritone sax, Neal Fountain on guitar and bass, Chris Enghauser on stand-up bass and Louis Romanos on drums.<br /><br />I said at the beginning of this review that Leavell broadens our knowledge of the blues.  When I say that, I don't just mean by giving us his interpretation of the 15 songs he selected for this project.  He also gives the listener a great, brief written history and background on the genre and the songs.  Just as he does with his playing, Leavell's love and appreciation for the songs and the artists originally responsible for them comes through in the booklet.  Heck, the booklet is worth the price of the CD by itself!<br /><br />Not only will Chuck Leavell fans want to snatch up this CD but musicologists, blues enthusiasts, pianists, just plain lovers of great music will most definitely want this album in their listening library.<br /><br />Hey, Steve, got any more great ideas to nudge your father-in-law with?  If you do, don't be shy about it.di Staton, Col. Bruce Hampton, Davis Causey, and Danny Barnes.

0307949508|5.0|This has been the best book I've read in a LONG time. (note: I've read 5 books in the past two weeks). Larsson's writing just draws you into the characters.

I am half way through and unfortunately I can only read at night but I can't wait to see what happens to Lisbeth and move onto the next book.

By reading this book, I learned that I may be establishing the improper mindsets in my children, employees, and myself.  The concepts presented also showed the issues that are observed in people who have the limiting mindsets and the approaches to working with these people.  The concepts presented are very important to developing a more improvement focused approach to life and the development of people, stopping to limit ourselves of inappropriate and limiting mindsets.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|L.A. Confidential is one incredible piece of film work. It recreates Los Angeles of the early to mid 1950's in such a way I would want to be there.<br /><br />The story line is complex and multi-faceted,dealing with Los Angeles after the demise of Mickey Cohen and what could have happened to his crime empire.<br /><br />Is all this truly fictional? I wonder. Check with Sid Hudgens to find out. The film is great, loaded with Oscar winners (future ones such as Russell Crowe, and including Kim Basinger who got Best Supporting Actress for this)and Oscar nominees.<br /><br />Wow! You have to buy this. I got the DVD in the lock case, used-like new which the DVD indeed is-like new.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I'd never heard of Arcade fire until last summer.  I was on the fence about this CD and would have given it 3 stars based on my initial impressions.  Months later, I am convinced that this is among the best efforts I've heard in some time.  There are some very dark themes here combined with many genre's of music including punk.<br />I went back to the earlier CDs and feel that this is their best effort by far.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Been a Leonard Cohen fan since the 80's. In my humble opinion, this album has some of the strongest songs he has ever written. \\"Show Me the Place\\" is an instant classic., as well is \\"Going Home\\".  \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Come Healing\\" are remarkable in every way, and this album has an overall sound that is richer, more tasteful, and more sparse than anything I can remember him doing. Mr. Cohen is even more the master of melody and verse, and his \\"Golden Voice\\" is even more magical and mysterious in its depth of tone, timing, and expression than I can remember as well. I hope he makes records for many more years to come. keith

B00756GKBA|4.0|The expectations I had for this record since it was announced were really high considering that she was going to work with William Orbit, the man who made \\"Ray of light\\" (1998) what it became then. Madonna has always been aware of the music she makes and to whom this is send to. She's a business woman first of all and a true musician as well so, after all her years in the music industry to support her desicions, she has always known how to manage her career. Why is this important to remember and to point out? Because of the nature of this new record MDNA (2012).<br /><br />The music on MDNA takes Madonna back to her roots going from synth-pop sounding like the 80's (Give me all your luvin, Superstar) to those pop ballads that made her huge in the 90's (Masterpiece and even Falling apart). But, fortunely these songs are not the real appealing of this record. The rough techno shown in \\"Gang bang\\" and \\"I'm addicted\\" place Madonna back where she belongs indeed (as someone else posted here before). These songs are perhaps the most well-done tracks done by her since \\"Hung up\\" or \\"Get together\\" (COADF-2005). Now, the regular pop songs that are in the list of my favorites now (Turn up the radio, Some girls and Love spent) are by far really catchy and addictive that you just can't get enough of them. On the other hand, I have an issue with a couple of tracks not because they're bad but because of the rappers going in (I'm a sinner and Give me all your luvin). Don't get me wrong but the parts where these ladies sing don't fit right if you ask me. I've heard songs from Gorillaz for example, where Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz) find the right way to include a rap set in the songs with the proper words, in the proper time with the proper vocals but, this is not found here with these Madonna's tracks. I just think that she's way too good to have people on her records if they are just going to blast out a bunch of words that sound silly instead of clever. Let's be honest, Madonna doesn't need anybody to sell her music out but she's clever enough to understand that having famous people in her songs will open a path for non-fans to listen to her and to get a chance to be accepted by youngsters as well. There's a saying that goes, \\"keep your friends close and your enemies even closer\\";).<br /><br />Madonna maybe didn't deliver a masterpiece with MDNA but for sure, she confirms once again that she's not planning on leaving any time now. Now, to all those haters that argue how poor this record is or how lame the lyrics are, let's just go straight to the point. Madonna has never been recognized for her lyrics nor for her creation in the music itself. She has always been recognized as a great entertainer, as a huge pop star who has always made fun, addictive records to listen to for almost 30 years already. I mean, don't try to put her on the spot where you're trying to compare her work with Bjork or Radiohead. I mean, she does her thing the way she knows how to do it and, if you allow me to say this, she might be one of the very few pop stars who actually knows how to work with longevity and popularity without losing anything at all.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|\\"I need to add this upfront; there are no separate books in the Game of Thrones series. Each book ends just like any other chapter. No one would read this book by itself. Start with book one, or watch the HBO series. This book does not stand alone.\\"<br /><br />I will eagerly await the next book, so I must be a fan. At times I throw down my book in disgust and walk away, not literally it would damage the Kindle. Still once I started the series I just kept ordering the next book.<br />I was going to take Amtrak to meet my wife in Chicago for a weekend. I decided to download a book to the Kindle. I was introduced to the series through the HBO production and my sons who had read the books. I decided to start with [[ASIN:B000FC1HBY A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two]] every time I finished a book I immediately ordered the next.  The HBO series was a  good introduction and I had no problem following the multitude of characters. Martin seems intent to prove there is only injustice in his complex medieval like world. Undoubtably a more accurate portrayal of our own human history, than most literary portrayals e.g. Robin Hood or King Arthur.  A character can be ignored for an entire book before learning their fate, but eventually they work back into the telling of Westeros and the War of the Five Kings. Martin must harbor an especially vindictive streak for his characters with the most integrity, still I trust in the Old Gods. I will hope that when Winter is finally over I will feel like this story has come to an end. Each book simply flows to the next, there are no resolutions. Complex characters, intricate descriptions of a world both mundane and magical make this series rewarding through it's many pages. An adult fantasy not to be undertaken by the faint of heart, but a pleasure for those who enjoy the strategic feint. I will now wait as have all the other fans of the series for the next episode. I like history so maybe another history before more Sci Fi or Fantasy.  My last book before living and dying with the Starks was Six Frigates [[ASIN:039333032X Six Frigates: The Epic History of the Founding of the U.S. Navy]] a good book on our early navy.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|It's a temptation to review this project from a musical perspective, analyzing and comparing each of these outstanding musicians to their previous successes and to other musicians efforts. However, since many other reviewers have already done that and I'd to keep this on the brief side, I will contribute this:from a purely emotional response perspective, listening through the first time, I was reminded of how I felt when I first heard Toy Matinee [[ASIN:B000058TDD Toy Matinee Special Edition]], Yes: Fragile [[ASIN:B00007KWHP Fragile]], Jellyfish: Bellybutton [[ASIN:B000002URU Bellybutton]], Ambrosia [[ASIN:B00003TKGH Ambrosia]] & occasionally Muse. Not saying it sounds 'like' any of those, but (as with each of those), it's definitely one of the most fresh, unique, truly musical and melodic sounding projects I've heard in many years. The musicianship is extraordinarily tasteful on each players part and production is exceptional. As much as I really enjoy Jeff Beck and Joe Bonamassa, the solo guitar work on this recording consistently brings the word 'soaring' to my mind...not showing off chops, but real musical note selection and passion in the playing that actually \\"moves\\" me. The engineering and production of the drums is amazingly real and present (minimal use of effects/eq on what already sounds like a great sounding kit), not to mention the playing, of course. Vocals are above and beyond, bass and keys are very tasty and the lyrics are wonderfully meaningful, as well. Every part played is essential to the sound, no filler and no unnecessary flailing. Indeed, there are brief moments one could label as derivative of these musicians individual influences however, the sum of the individual contributions makes this a unique, non-derivative work. This is one of those recordings that I'd be excited to use to to show off a great pair of speakers.  I am reminded of the video of Leonard Bernstein conducting \\"hands off\\" toward the end of this wonderful talk by Itay Talgam(absolutely worth the 15 minute investment in your time [...]), Bernstein is so confident in his individual players that his implicit direction is no longer necessary and he leaves them to soar on their own. Because of the mastery of each individual, and their choices to be tasteful rather than flailing, Flying Colors very much soars  Thank you to everyone involved for sharing your passion with us.  BTW, I purchased both the CD and the vinyl here at amazon and have ALWAYS been pleased with their service.
B007OUFESC|2.0|I love the actors - but this film was short of keeping me awake.  The plot creeps up on your like a shadow and it is slow in getting to the point.  Keira Knightly is beautiful, but I am sure she will find other scripts to delight her mind and talent.  As for the portrayal of Freund and Jung, the casting was superb.  If you choose to see this film, and you can manage to keep your eyelids apart for moments at a time, you can find the actors' craft quite remarkable.  I gave this film 2 stars for the casting quality only.

B003VANOFY|4.0|Update: 08/20/2015 After owning this product for a few years, I have to say i still quite like the headset itself and the way it functions, however there is one big flaw. The thing breaks easily. I'm not talking about the Mic or the Headphones themselves, but rather the structure. Sure, you can use it still, but the pieces on the side seem to have very flimbsy interior plastic. Where the screws on the side go in had a habit of breaking, causing one of the headphones to hang, usually the one with the mic (The left). Because of this, over the years I had this I had to, on average, use the warranty 4 times. This was over 3 years. It seems to be a known flaw as I had no issue returning and getting a new one, which was nice, but filling out the paperwork and shipping it can be tedious. Because of this I am reducing the product from 5 to 4 star.  Beautiful product, works amazingly, but because of this little infrastructure flaw it can become tedious. And once the warranty is over you may be SOL on the product, so be warned it could have a limited life just because of that.  Old Review: This product is a dream. It is comfortable to wear for hours on end, you can actually USE the surround sound for games that support it, and it is good for about 8-9 hours when fully charged. And when not charged? You can plug it in directly and charge while you're glued to a game without problems! It is clear, no static, only problem is with distance. If you leave the broadcast device and go behind a wall it has a bit of trouble identifying. So while you go and grab something to eat or get a drink away from your computer it may blink out for a few seconds, but always reconfigures easily.  Overall, no complaints, as I didn't get it to go further than one-room away while talking on skype. MUST HAVE for anyone who can fit the bill. This review is after one month of use.

B006IDG2T6|1.0|I just finished Sam Harris' book and must say that I have not stopped laughing since.<br /><br />His neuroscience-based evidence can be summed up as two concepts:<br />  1.  We have a subconscious which cannot be directly controlled, and<br />  2.  Before exterior actions can occur, some brain activity must occur.<br /><br />Really, did anyone fail to understand these two concepts without reading this book.  Yet based on these two observations, Mr. Harris draws the conclusion that we have no control over our lives, though much of his follow-on chapters seem to undermine this conclusion.  For instance, he continues to offer suggestions to how we can make use of the fact that we have no free will in running society.<br /><br />This leads me to my most obvious criticism: his suggestions on how to handle violent criminals.  He uses this \\"no free will\\" position to decry \\"punitive\\" reactions but insists that we have a right to incarcerate them.  If they have no choice in their behaviors -- as he claims -- then how can we criticize their behavior, much less punish them.  It is their nature and can have no moral inferiority to his behavior which is no less compelled as theirs.  If they are behaving as they must behave, then we have no basis to restrain them.  In fact, they could declare our refusal to rape and kill as inferior.  After all, we can claim no moral superiority, since we don't do these things because we are compelled not to them.  My guess is that if a man shows up in Mr. Harris' office, he will appeal to the man's capacity to make a decision other than to kill him.<br /><br />Free will must be presumed prior to any intelligent discussion to anything else.  Lacking free will, we lack humanity.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|I love finding a surprisingly good film among the rubble, but how did I miss this one?<br /><br />I'd recorded 'The Prestige' from IFC. Wow. Nominated for two Academy Awards a few years back, the film features a great cast, a good story based on the magician trade, and a couple of really fun twists, although the final surprise didn't come through as strongly as the director may have wanted. Michael Caine is great, and Piper Perabo plays a small, but an endearing role. Very enjoyable, and now I know all about the draw, the turn, and the prestige. Ta da!

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I usually don't like the majority of these kid's CGI movies but I loved Puss In Boots.It has action,comedy and even a little bit of romance.I guess it helps that I'm a cat lover.This movie kept my attention all the way through.Antonio Banderas is great as the voice for Puss.I thought the jokes were funny and I liked that they showed Puss as a kitten.I liked all the dancing.Puss would be great on Dancing With The Stars,better than alot of the celebrities on there.lol.This movie is just as good as Shrek if not better.I hope there will be many sequels.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|HOW I USE IT:<br />I wanted an upgrade for my crappy Nike+ shoe pedometer that was giving me VERY inaccurate distances. Purchased this after reading several reviews online and listening to many people complain about all their watches, this seemed like it was the least complained about.  I live in Hawaii. I use this watch for long distance running, trail running through rainforest jungles, and for hiking up mountains. It has been in extremely hot blazing-sun-type environments, as well as monsoons. I have used it at least twice a week at a minimum when my schedule has been tight and almost every day when it hasn't. I use the heart rate monitor when I do my runs, but not my hikes (personal preference).  The only thing I have not done with it is take it underwater, or in very cold environments.<br /><br />WHAT I THINK:<br />I love it.<br />I have never had any issue with its functionality. It has never had problems with the bezel that many others complain about. the tracking is almost perfect (no GPS will be 100% all the time); but after reviewing my runs and plotting it on the map, I am very satisfied with the tracking.  I use the Garmin Connect which is a free software interface they have on their website and is 1000x better than the software provided.  I mainly really only use my watch for tracking distance and time. I sometimes use the handy \\"virtual partner\\" feature of the watch, which actually really helps improve my runs.  The watch comes with two wrist straps: one rubber and the second a Velcro strap. It comes with a USB dongle that has a good enough range that when I arrive back home after running it usually tries to connect to my computer upstairs when I am in the process of unlocking the front door.  A nice thing about this watch is the charger. It clips onto the watch. There is no fiddling with a charger adaptor plug, no taking the battery out to charge it, no trying to place the watch in the exact stupid position the docking base wants it in...just a littleclip on. There are several Dozen features on this watch haven't used yet (just not what I need or just haven't played with it). The virtual trainer seems as if it would come in very handy... You can program it so if your heart rate drops below a certain rate, it will tell you to speed up.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />If you want a good gps watch that tracks well and stands up to a Navy guy taking it over all the trails in Hawaii, this watches for you.<br />Feature wise, there's little that this WON'T do. 5-stars.
0618154043|3.0|\\"Unfinished Tales\\" now represents something of a publishing problem, since the centrepiece of the book, the broken sequence of fragments and drafts of the projected 'great tale' of the children of Húrin (told only in abbreviated form in \\"The Silmarillion\\"), has recently been superseded by \\"The Children of Húrin\\" (see [[ASIN:0618894640 Narn I Chin Hurin: The Tale of the Children of Hurin]]). With new manuscript discoveries and a reconsideration of the relationship between the fragments it was possible to form a complete narrative, and one which differs in many details from that in \\"Unfinished Tales\\". The rest of the book contains much that is fascinating, but it is just too thin in quality, or too 'technical', to sustain the book on its own. There is only one piece that matches 'The Children of Húrin' in stature, and that is the fragment 'Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin', being what survives of a final, mature attempt to tell this story in a full form - another of the three 'great tales' Tolkien planned to produce. (As a narrative it is perhaps rather static; but for me it is the most haunting work in the book, even if the 'Narn' is greater.)    For a new reader it could hardly be recommended to ignore the new book and just read 'The Children of Húrin' in its \\"Unfinished Tales\\" form (the cat's out of the bag). But the other material in the book still needs to be preserved, and shown off to best advantage, as it was originally by association with the 'great tales'. Perhaps there is more high quality material that could be rescued from the massive \\"History of Middle Earth\\" and promoted to \\"Unfinished Tales\\"? After all, this book is by default a kind of highlights volume.    Or maybe there IS still a place for a REVISED version of the more technical style of presentation of 'The Children of Húrin' used in \\"Unfinished Tales\\", to complement the new book - with the new fragments added, as well as the new ideas for how they fit together. Certainly it's hard to imagine the book without this work at its heart. (And I must say that on balance I prefer the story in its more 'honest' \\"Unfinished Tales\\" presentation. Maybe because that's how I first read it! But in the new book the illusion of a finished work sometimes clashes with passages that lack final polish.)    A new edition would also be handy for some of the technical pieces in the book. The 'Hunt for the Ring' chapter, in particular, seems to need heavy revision in the light of new discoveries.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|The great special effects aside, the plot is just a mishmash of 2 older movies and a propoganda tv show. The movie is preachy, insisting that corporations are evil that activly try to pollute. It preaches that the millitary are a bunch of wanton killers that will slaughter innocents for minerals. The \\"Hero\\" teaches the poor innocents how to defend themselves. A bunch of flashey crap.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|This album is certainly one of the more abstract sounding ones.  At times you won't even know what instrument is being played (or if it's an instrument at all), but nonetheless, it's great and you can't help but love it.  Imagine if Led Zeppelin were sent forward in time to the year 2050: That is this album.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|First of all, I did not like the ULTRAVIOLET either like most reviewers commented, so they are giving this item a low rating. I tried this so-called ultraviolet digital copy it but it was too much of a hassle so my digital copy is of no use to me.  I am basing my five star rating on the movie itself because I loved it and I intend to watch this over and over.  Of course, there are the sad parts with too many characters losing their life fighting evil (but if you read the book, then you already know that this was coming).  The ending more than compensates for the sadness, you will feel the triumph when you get to the end.  The actors are superb although most of them are still young -- just very believable!  You feel their pain, their joy and their love. This was just the perfect ending to an epic story!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I rented this from Amazon Instant Video and it was such an easy process and the movie was great.  I can't wait to rent some more!

B0052UZIFA|2.0|SYSTEM: Asus Transformer<br />OS: Android<br />Version: Ice Cream Sandwich (v4.0.1)<br />I paid $2.99 from the App Store sometime in Jan 2012 and it worked great. Then I upgraded to the new Android OS and it NEVER evens opens :(<br />It's a real shame because I spent quite a lot of time on it (finished it once and unlocked mini games) and the interface and game play was perfectly acceptable.<br />They really need to address what is causing the constant crashes/ incompatibility with the new OS and launch a patch fix.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Background:<br /><br />I used a first GEN ipod shuffle for years because it fits tucked up in the back pocket of my motorcycle helmet. As the ipod wore out and I grew tired of itunes, I have moved to a sanza zip. It is a much more intuitive player than the ipod. but it really isn't the quality of the ipod. The Ipod really does crank, and really needs no amplification on the motorcycle, but like I said I just cannot like ITunes. So I decided to get an itunes less player.<br /><br />Now:<br />I really like my new player, but as I said it is not near as loud as the Ipod, so I decided to try this amplifier because it clips on my helmet right next to my Sanza Clip zip. BTW this set up works great on the helmet especially if you embed the speakers in the helmet.Then it is all self contained.<br /><br />I read reviews where people say there is buzzing. I haven't noticed that on mine. But that being said it really doesn't amplify that much. Even with the amplifier, it isn't as loud as the ipod. It is barely loud enough so it works, but this does not turn your cheaper player into an Ipod or some other quality player. It is worth the money at least for me, but it is not outstanding. I would be willing to pay double for something that amplifies a little more, but this will do for now.<br /><br />One last thing to add: The battery life isn't that long, but for motorcycle rides it seems to be fine. I have to charge it every two-three days to keep it going riding back and forth to work. Once the battery dies the music stops. I mean it doesn't play at a lower volume it stops playing till you charge it back up. If you are considering this, I suggest buying two so you have one always charged.
0812416317|4.0|Of Mice and Men, one of the best novels I've read before. But, before you read it, you should have at least a slight background about what happened on the great depression. Also, The author conceptualize many characters inside this novel and as more you read as more the story gets exciting. I highly recommend to read Of Mice and Men.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this for 2 reasons. 1 because it was purple. 2 because it had a leather look about it but, not the price of leather. I also like the way I can adjust the angle of my kindle while playing some games. It's great and stylish.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|This was just bad.  Poorly written, could care less about the characters.  Would have been better as a children's cartoon on a Saturday morning.  Mr. Crichton most likely never intended this to be published as it is.  Don't waste even a day reading this.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|This is a great collection. Some of the tracks feature other artists without the benefit of Dinah's vocals, a little weird i thought, but Most of the songs, She's Amazing! This set arrived sooner than estimated, fully shrink-wrapped. And the cds play beautifully. My only issue is that the cd case seems to have been built to hold 8 cds, not 4. And so I'm left with this big bulky cd case, small issue, but still...
0439023521|1.0|The Hunger Games would be much more palatable if this story were original.  It is not.  I read Battle Royale a few years ago and greatly enjoyed the entire experience.  I'm a high school teacher, and my students have been raving about The Hunger Games.  While I was aware of the comparison to Battle Royale I thought I'd give the story a try, wanting to judge it on its own merits.  I came away sorely disappointed.<br /><br />The storyline is virtually identical to that of Battle Royale.  This is concerning for two reasons.  First, it is glaringly unoriginal.  Throughout the story, I kept hoping for the plots of the two books to diverge onto separate paths.  This did not happen in any sustained way.  The political environment, the setup in the arena, the writing about the Games, the love story, they have all been written before and given much more articulate and compelling treatment.  Second, it is written in an inferior manner to Royale.  I could forgive the \\"plot inspiration\\" were the author to exhibit exceptional literary skill.  Unfortunately, Ms. Collins disappoints.  In fairness, the one element that I appreciated from Games was the preparation process.  This diverged to a significant degree from Royale's plot, and made me quite hopeful for the arena.  I sped through those pages hoping for more originality, yet, found none.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the arena scene, virtually two-thirds of the book, fails to offer the main character any moral dilemma.  This frustrated me to a great degree.  The author constructed a story arc with which she could really play with morality and emotion.  Instead she included a contrived, poorly written, and uninspired love story.  The main character feels, in this reviewer's opinion, almost a bystander to the main conflict.<br /><br />Now, I'm not a young adult, but as a teacher of young adults I find the acclaim of such a one dimensional work truly frightening.  While I'm excited to see young people reading anything (anything is better than no reading), I feel that their age group is missing out on something more.  For those young people discovering reading, the premise of the story is irresistible.  Sadly, the conclusion of the story leaves me wishing that I had reread Battle Royale.  This could have been a novel headed for the English cannon.  Instead, it will go the way of the Twilight series, fading into irrelevance, as its readers mature.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is an ok game.. easy to earn money when you don't watch it bit investment monies are harder to come by. need to get expansions and keep your environmental impact down in order to keep your score up
B007BVOF8E|4.0|The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story.  You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series.  I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage.  Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|First and foremost I would like to say The Hunger Games Trilogy was the first book I bought for my Amazon Kindle Fire. I dread any type of book that is going to be a teen craze, but as always I got dragged into the books. After seeing a preview of the movie I bought the book hoping it will be good. And sure enough it was. The Hunger Games: I really liked the story line between Peeta and Katniss. And the sisterly connection between her and Prim. I was surprised though, when the games started how brutal the book was. Not that it was gruesome to the extent that it was vivid. It gets to the point and then moves on.<br /><br />Catching Fire: I was mad at the fact they (Katniss and Peeta) go back to the Hunger Games for the Quarter Quell, but was enticing to read how to it will work out. This book brings you more characters and puts you through a bit of confusion on who's on who's team.<br /><br />Mockingjay: This book and I am sorry to say was my least favorite. It was a bit drawn out with the war uprising. Katniss was very confusing and torn in different directions (she pissed me off really lol) but what hurt the most is what had happened to Peeta. I actually teared up! lol But all in all, the books were enjoyable, and as I have just saw the movie the other night, I hope they make a second movie (with a better director/screen writer). Thanks for reading my review.
B00756GKBA|2.0|I got what I expected, but not what I hoped for. I actually loved it on a quick first listen, but then my thoughts changed. This is a woman whom I've admired my entire life, and a woman I'll credit my success to one day. I felt the songwriting was lacking, there's nothing inspiring to me here. It seems like it was forced and written really quickly. The music outshines her voice and I also felt that she's not using her voice to its max. Remember songs like Deeper & Deeper, Ray of Light, and the great b-side, Your Honesty...what happened to those vocals? For ballads, remember the voice on Rain, In This Life and Mer Girl? That's what I was hoping for and instead, I felt like I was listening to Britney Spears. 2 stars for Gang Bang, Love Spent, Free Falling and Beautiful Killer. I _ Up and Turn up the Radio are bearable, the rest can go. Masterpiece was a huge disappointment for me as well, why the THUMP THUMP THUMP on a beautiful ballad?<br /><br />I still love Madonna...I just feel that at her age and with all of wisdom she's gained over the years, she could share something a bit more deep with the world.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. This series has sucked me in and held me to the end. I could not put the books down and when I did I couldn't stop thinking about them. The first time I read this book, I was confused.  I did not understand a lot of what was going on, even though I had read the previous two books.  I was not even sure if I liked this book.  After reading the series a second time, I understand and appreciate MJ more.  Yes, it does show how horrible war can be and how no one is immune to the effects of it, but it also shows hope rising from the ashes.  Collins shows that in the last chapter and epilogue with her references to spring, rebirth, and new life.  I think this is a beautiful story.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Excellent Book, this is book 1 of the trilogy, Im 30% through reading the second book and not getting any housework done, I can't put it down. Peter May takes me to places I have never been but feel like I know them well. Great characters and places, fantastic story line.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Holy crap! It turns out that my Inner Goddess got as bored with the repetitive language in this novel as I did. By the end of chapter two it's crystal clear that Ana often bites her lip, blushes, and rolls her eyes. It's also clear that Christian's eyes are grey. Really really grey. Um, did I mention that Christian's eyes are grey? Nevertheless I found this to be a fairly interesting read. Steamy<br /> sex scenes even though I'm not into BDSM. Even found myself wondering near the end of the story what happened in Fifty's life that turned him into such a train wreck. The answer will probably turn out to be predictable if I can make it through book two in the trilogy. I'm a little hesitant about starting the second book. If the language is as repetitive as this first novel I may find myself rolling my eyes like Ana and wanting to spank someone like Christian.
1595826971|5.0|This book was great.  It's printed on nice, glossy paper, and full of lots of amazing conept art for this game (one of the best this gen).<br /><br />My non-gamer mother looked through it, and she really enjoyed it.  She felt the need to point out all the \\"gross\\" pictures and let me know how unpleasant they were, but when she finished the book, she was really enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />It made me kind of sad, though.  There was a lot of awesome content in here that didn't make it to the game... anyway, if you liked the game, think of this as the bonus content that comes with most movies, the deleted scenes and director's commentary you usually get.
0756655730|5.0|First, a warning: this book is heavy. It claims to be around 6 lbs, but feels like 10+ lbs.  This is also the best advanced dinosaur and early creature book ever.  It has everything. Plate tectonics, fossils, extinction theory, timelines, etc. AND a great creature encyclopedia. No matter that this is a grown up book, do not think it is too much (except perhaps in weight) for a true dinosaur enthusiast of any age. It is chock full of great glossy color photos and illustrations. The information, though thorough, is presented in very accessible language. We bought it for our small child, and his 10 year old cousin is clambering for one too.  But there is enough here to keep teenagers and adults both entertained and informed.  As this is replacing 6-10 smaller, inferior books, its size is not too onerous. However, it does need a table or pillow for support for reading. Money well spent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This a great game.. takes a bit to unlock most of the games... but otherwise lots of fun<br />especially for free.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are several games to play on here. Yes, you have to win some games to get to the other games, but its worth it. The games are fun and make you want to keep aiming for higher points. Definitely a must have for all ages!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The microshell cover is pretty good.  A little flimsy, but helps protect the Kindle Fire.  I like it.
0307959856|1.0|As a Pride and Prejudice enthusiast I was excited to read this book... and then soon completely disappointed.  The plot goes through way too many boring patches, and then has an anticlimactic ending.  Never mind the fact that I did not like how P.D. James depicted Darcy and Elizabeth to be dull.  I definitely do not agree with reviews that state James provides an \\"exploration\\" of the characters.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Nightwish and Epica were my favorite bands.  We all know what happened to NW and Epica's new one has too much growling and grunting to enjoy Simone's voice.  This new effort from Xandria is better than anything I've heard.  Manuela has the most mazing Mezzo Soprano Voice I've heard.  I've listened to it a bunch of times already and plan to for quite some time.

0307956350|5.0|The almost universal appeal of Chris Pavone's debut novel slowly becomes evident as the reader is gently tugged and prodded and then gradually catapulted through its plot, word by word and page by page. It's a thriller in the same way that Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT is a courtroom drama; while both at their surface are easily classified as genre fiction, the truth goes deeper. At heart, THE EXPATS is about the depth of the secrets that are kept by and between husband and wife, together and from each other.<br /><br />At first, it seems that it's Kate Moore who's the holder of all the trick cards in her marriage with her husband, Dexter. To the world, Kate is a working mother whose job concerns something vague and intangible, having to do with writing position papers for the U.S. State Department.  In reality, she works for the federal government, but her job is far more interesting than shuffling papers across a desk.<br /><br />Dexter, an expert in computer system security, is a smart guy and a dependable husband but is somewhat lacking in ambition. He could have made millions during the computer software bubble but for poor timing (\\"missed it by that much,\\" as Maxwell Smart used to say), though he is content to more or less dawdle along. Furthermore, he is not especially good looking; he is one of those guys who you see with his wife and wonder How did he land her? All in all, Kate and Dexter's lives aren't bad, even though they have difficulty making ends meet. And, of course, there are Kate's job-related secrets, which she fears will come back to haunt her one day.<br /><br />Everything changes when Dexter is offered a lucrative job in Luxembourg, giving the Moores a chance to live in a new and exotic place and for Kate to quit her job --- her real one --- and reinvent herself. Unfortunately, the perfect life that she envisions never materializes. Dexter is working longer and longer hours for a secretive employer whose identity cannot be revealed due to what he refers to as \\"confidential issues.\\" Meanwhile, Kate is bored with being a full-time mother. Truth be told, she misses her old job. The exotic, cosmopolitan locale of their new home and their side trips to other destinations in Europe cannot make up for the drudgery of day-to-day housekeeping and the almost daily coffee klatches with the other ex-pat wives. Additionally, there is an incident from Kate's past that  haunts her on a daily basis and threatens to turn her world upside down<br /><br />That threat soon manifests itself in the form of another American couple who almost aggressively seeks Kate and Dexter's friendship. Utilizing a skillset that is rusty but still reliable, Kate begins to do some investigating, not only of her new friends, but also of her own husband, whose behavior becomes more secretive by the day. She discovers fake offices, false records, and secret bank accounts containing staggering sums of money. As she slowly unravels the truth about Dexter, she finds that what she initially thought was a deception or two involves a long-range scheme that runs wider and deeper than she ever could have imagined and that she fears will swallow her family whole. She begins taking steps to avoid that, but her own past may well impede her efforts.<br /><br />THE EXPATS is one of those (relatively) rare thriller novels that will appeal to men and women in equal measure. Everyone has secrets, many of which are kept for good reasons and differ from person to person, situation to situation. Anyone who has ever been in a personal relationship and kept a secret (or a carload of them) from their significant other will see themselves in Kate and Dexter, no matter how ordinary or mundane they might see their lives as being. The fact that it is set against the backdrop of several of Europe's more sophisticated locales doesn't hurt the story one bit, either. Look for THE EXPATS to be a spring and summer travel companion for vacationers everywhere.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Looks great but does not update the temp even when set to hourly updates. No option to manually update. Does not always show time of last update.
0553801473|2.0|I will keep this review short, and defer to other reviews for more detail on why this book turned a, otherwise, good novel series into a waste of my time and money.  It's CRAP!

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I read the whole trilogy in a few days and, like everyone else has said, I loved the first two books. But with Mockingjay, I kept thinking to myself, \\"Is this even the same author?\\" If, in the future, it's revealed that this last book was ghostwritten, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Just a completely different feel than the others. It almost felt like Collins was just trying to get this all over with in a hurry. When I finished Mockingjay, I put it down and just sat there for a while, stunned. \\"That's it? That's how she's going to end all this?\\" Felt kinda cheated. After this finale I almost wish I had never picked up the books to start with. Depressing. Hopeless. But maybe that's the reaction Collins was trying to elicit.
030788743X|4.0|Fun story, well told, lots of nice callbacks to pop culture of my generation (80's & early 90's). Even more callbacks to the video games of that era. In fact, if I was a gamer myself, this probably would have been a 5-star book, but as a non-gamer a few things kind of went over my head. Still highly recommended to gamers and non-gamers alike.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|well i thik this is a good game to play my cousin will love it so yea that is way i chooes this game.
B006XF5BTG|3.0|I saw some glowing reviews for this and also noticed it was on the Kindle Lending Library, so I figured I'd take a look.<br /><br />Most of it seems like stuff you can find by searching on the internet.<br /><br />It felt like the entire first half of the book was just the author saying \\"Wow, you'll never believe how easy it is to get the body you want.  Seriously!  You'll never believe it!  You'll see how it easy it is in the next few pages, but, MAN! You seriously won't believe how easy it is.  Let me tell you how easy it can be.  Because it really is easy!  I mean, seriously, any person can do this.\\"  x 50% of the book.<br /><br />Once he gets past all this filler, it is actually somewhat interesting.  I can see this being really helpful for a beginner to weight training.  It's written in a very conversational style and it's easy to follow.<br /><br />If you are a beginner, I highly recommend reading [[ASIN:0982522738 Starting Strength, 3rd edition]]
B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought this headset for $20 about two years ago. It was a good value back then, but I'm not sure I would buy it at the current price.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Extremely comfortable. I have worn these for 12 hours straight and not had any problems. The padding and the soft felt material are fantastic.<br />-The headphones have decent sound quality.<br />-Pretty durable. I have used these for two years and the headphones and cords are still in one piece.<br />-The volume adjuster on the cord is really useful, and it's in the perfect spot.<br />-The microphone is really cool and convenient. Microphone quality isn't great, but it isn't terrible either.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-The microphone broke after about six months. It's not broken physically, but it doesn't pick up sound anymore.<br />-The headset is huge and looks kinda ridiculous.<br />-No adjustable bass or surround sound, but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />It's very comfortable and well-built, but still just a mid-range headset.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. This book was great with amazing details. I love action books so this fit me perfectly. This book is very groosing but also one really good book and I cant wait to see how the movie is. This may not be a good book for really young kids because there are some parts in the book very sad and groosing.

B004LROMQG|5.0|When is season 4 coming out?!!!!  I love this series!  It gets better each season!  I love the storyline -- it is somewhat different than other stories of Merlin and King Arthur -- but they bring all the characters in -- and the storyline is great.  Just love it!  Watch it to see!
1612130283|1.0|Go read something else- this isn't worth your time.  If you're looking for erotic or romantic fiction, find just about ANY other book written in that genre, and it will be better than this book.  The writing is juvenile, the plot so ham-fisted that you could practically hear the cogs grinding as you read.  Fantastically over-hyped book which should never have been published.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome story! I was thoroughly engrossed in this story, it was that addicting! I have to say, Suzanne Collins writes in the first person with a memorizing flow. I loved it! I am definitely continuing this series. The contrast between the districts and the Capitol were drastic but they were painted out beautifully by the author. It was fast paced, well narrated and just overall amazing! Hands down, one the best books I've read this year.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The acting in this portrayal of Jane Eyre is the best you will ever see. Toby Stephens is his exceptional self but Ruth Wilson's ability to express emotion is phenomenal. Her facial expressions communicate the string that runs from his chest to hers, the unbreakable tie that combines their hearts. Charlotte Bronte must look down from the heavens on this portrayal of her beautiful work with a smile in her own heart.
B0063IH60K|3.0|this WAS an awesome app until they started running video ads.  If it wasn't  for that I'd give it five stars.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Ok, so let me start off by saying that I agree with those who rated this story with 1 star.  Yes Travis is possessive.  Yes there are some grammar/spelling mistakes (not enough to distract the reader though), and yes the relationship is far from perfect.  With that being said, I couldn't help but secretly hope they would get it together and work it out.  The first half or so of the book is all about the tension that is building between the two main characters.  And each time Abby goes out with someone other than Travis I found myself waiting for her to realize how much Travis cared about her.  When she finally realizes how much she cares about them, they still aren't anywhere near perfect.  They go through more fighting, and changing, and growing.  This book does not have the typical fairy tale plot of most books, it is a very real, almost frightening book of what a relationship is.  Work.  Patience.  And trust.<br /><br />I personally was relieved to read a book that wasn't perfect, that was realistic and represented a real relationship.  Those who complain about the over usage of bad language, and over dramatization of sex and fighting, clearly didn't read the warning that says for mature readers only right in the product description.  If you don't want to read a book that has fighting, sex, and strong language, stay away from this book and please keep your 1 star ratings to yourself for something that was warned to you before you even purchased the book.  If that is why you are giving it a one star then you clearly can't read very well anyways.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This review is of the Standard DVD version of the film.<br /><br />While this film by Alexander Payne (\\"Sideways\\", \\"About Schmidt\\") garnered LOTS of Academy Awards nomination - and some Oscars too - I wouldn't consider it in a class with the other nominees like \\"Hugo\\" or \\"The Artist\\". This is a \\"family relationship\\" drama, pure and simple. And we have the dying, cheating wife to add some emotion to the story. (No, I'm not doing a spoiler alert here. The trailer tells you she was having an affair and she goes into a non-reversible coma in the film's first five minutes.).<br /><br />The star of the movie is George Clooney, plain and simple. And he gives a great performance - though you'll still see him as \\"handsome actor George Clooney playing a role\\". Young actress Amara Miller, as the nine-year old Scottie nearly upstages Clooney in some scenes. The film is a great promotional ad for visiting Hawaii (and a geography - and history - lesson) as Clooney and his two daughters hop the islands searching out his wife's lover.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the film - and so will you. Just don't expect to have a life-changing experience. And, oh yes, bring tissues. You'll need them.<br /><br />There are well over 100 reviews here already - nearly all about the theater version of the film so you can read as many as you want. This review is focusing on the Standard DVD.<br /><br />There are four bonuses on the Standard DVD: \\"Everybody Loves George\\" (7 min) where the cast talks about working with Clooney, \\"Working with Alexander Payne\\" (13 min) where everyone - including Clooney - talks about the director, \\"Hawaiian Style\\" (16 minutes) which covers modern Hawaiian culture and the films \\"theatrical Trailer\\"<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
0091940737|5.0|This was a fantastic read!  The most scholarly book written on modern feminism, it is not.  However, Ms. Moran did a wonderful job of presenting an important and serious topic in an approachable, relatable, and hilarious way.  I laughed out loud heartily at least once per chapter.  I will definitely be sharing this book with all of my favorite women and am looking forward to the conversations that follow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian Grey is hot.  That will become evident to most readers (women, anyway) pretty early on in the story.  He and Ana Steele embark on a passionate, extremely sexual affair.  Here's the catch - Ana is a virgin and very innocent and unsophisticated and Christian is...not.  He has predilections towards S&M and an intense need to control.  Sounds like a trashy romance novel, right?  Well, it's not.  Yes, this book has a sex scene on practically every other page.  But, at the same time, the story is deeply romantic.  Two people are finding a way to love each other while confronting their own demons.  Also, neither character is a stereotype.  Christian is hot and successful and talented, but he has some deep dark issues that manifest themselves in an unconventional way in relationships with women.  He is definitely a romantic hero, but not the stereotypical Fabio type in most trashy romance novels.  Ana's character flies in the face of feminist conventions.  She is strong and independent, but she is willing to be in a relationship with Christian and accommodate his control issues and his dark past.  I would definitely recommend!
B00756GKBA|2.0|I mean really? Why is she doing this to her career? As a die hard Madonna fan I cannot get behind this record at all. There is absolutely no flow, most of these tracks sound like fillers and if she says 'boys and girls' one more time on this cd I will throw it out the window.<br />This is a 50 something year old woman who has made some of the best dance pop music the world will ever know. She is a living legend but she is making a mockery of herself. On the few tracks where she acts her age, you hear a woman with a very pretty voice and some very stellar production but unfortunately that is not the norm on this record.<br />I figured after Hard Candy (which I also disliked but now realize at least had some type of flow to it) she would ditch these 'rappers' and the need to attempt to appeal to tweens. We are her fans, we are in our 30's and older now. Most of us don't like the garbage on the radio and most of us thought Madonna was not only above this but beyond it. I feel as if she has dumbed her talent down to try to get news fans but in turn all she is doing is alienating her old ones.<br />At her age she should be singing about meaningful things (and no trashing your ex husband in 1 track does not count), at least on American Life she had a point and a purpose and the production was sick. Same with Music and don't even get me started on Confessions, why she did not keep with that formula, I will never know.

B00004YM0D|4.0|A Timeless Classic<br />By Dylan Pan<br /><br /> Few movies can paint such an inspirational illustration of black and white struggle for integration like Remember the Titans. Although it was \\"based on a true story,\\" this film exaggerates some aspects of the story to emphasize the significance of racial unity.<br /> The period in which the film (Directed by Boaz Yakin) took place was in 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia. The story begins with a Supreme Court rule that integrated blacks and whites into public schools. Tension was escalated within the white community. White parents protested, and white students complained. The football players also feared for the security of their playing position. Furthermore, T.C William High School's renowned football coach, Bill Yoast (Played by Will Patton) was asked to step down, and to be replaced by African American coach, Herman Boone (Played by Denzel Washington). Controversy arose within the white football team on whether or not they should quit the team in support of their coach. By the end of the dilemma, Coach Yoast agrees to take position as Herman's assistant coach/ defensive coach in effort to secure the success of the team.<br /> At first, most people thought Coach Boone would be bias and prioritize black football players in terms of game time and playing positions. However, during his first day coaching in the gym, it was apparent that Coach Boone's ambition strived towards team building and winning. During his 2-week intensive training camp to recruit football players, he prioritized respect between teammates of different races and discipline. If a player lacked either one of those traits, he did not get game time. It did not matter if he was the team's best player.<br />Throughout the beginning of integration within the football team, black player Julius Campbell (Played by Wood Harris) and white player Gerry Bertier (Played by Ryan Hurst) caused most of the controversy within camp. On the first day of camp, they fought over who came first in line for a cup of water. It was not until Coach Boone forced the white and black players to interact with each other that they finally began to unite and know one other better. He did not ask them to be friends, but rather just respect one another. In one scene in the locker rooms, the angle of the camera expresses the growing tension between a newly recruited quarterback \\"Sunshine\\" (Played by Kip Pardue) with other black players on the team. Suddenly, the boys break into laughter and shake hands. Rather than being so sensitive, all the boys embraced one another and laughed till the night ended.<br /> Overall, this movie leaves a big impact to their audience's perspective on racial integration and the benefits of unity. The songs played such as Marvin Gaye's \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" represented how the Titans could overcome any obstacles as long as they were a team. Although many statistics and facts were distorted from the true story, the use of fiction was used to intensify the audiences' feeling towards the film. Many of the brawls between black and white football players never happened. In fact, many of the game scores were also altered to convey the \\"underdog\\" experience.<br />Although football may not be everyone's favorite topic, the message of racial equality and unity that this film brings across will always be remembered.
0439023491|5.0|I HATED the ending to Hunger Games. I really wanted to know what happened next so I immediately bought this book. I read the book in a day and it did not disappoint. I find the characters very addicting. I want to know more about them. I want to understand if Katniss will end up with Peeta or Gale. I want to know if the districts finally decide to rebel against the evil capitol. Well I got glimpses of answers in this book. I can't wait to read the third one.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|beautiful graphics! challenging! I love that it comes with its own walkthrough in case you get stuck. I played from start to finish in one setting. I couldn't put it down! I hope they make another.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|novel in the series when the author is plainly and painfully setting the stage for the next two books in this series.  An evolution takes place in this a basically 3-book novel and it's quite interesting and totally semi-erotic in it's content.  The first book could be considered very disturbing by most romance fans.  And that is the point.  If you can get thru the first novel you will be rewarded with a very intriguing and original, at least to me, story.  I'm was pleased with the whole series although it might shock at times at least there were no vampires/witches/werewolves, thank goodness or should I say badness.  There is a very good reason Christian, the male protagonist, is the way he is and if you keep with the series I guaranty you will not be disappointed.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Okay, so I hear on the radio that VH is heading into my town on tour.  I think to myself \\"Cool, I should check them out this time around, who knows when I will get a chance to see them with DLR again.\\"  So I jump online and see that they are touring because they are pushing a new album.  At this point I was a little hesitant to get my tickets because I wasn't sure how the new album was going to sound.  It couldn't be any good- but worse case scenario, they play five or six new songs and then we get to the good stuff anyway.  The website was letting you hear the new single Tattoo, so I thought that I would check it out.  I wasn't very impressed at first listen.  I thought maybe it was because the speakers on my computer made it sound worse than it really was.  The show would be cool anyway, even if they played some new material.  Fast forward a couple of weeks and I decided I would go ahead and buy this album.  It would be a good idea to be familiar with some of the new stuff for the concert.  Needless to say, after listening to the album I was kicking myself.  Kicking myself for not picking it up earlier and losing my faith in the band.  This album far exceeded my expectations and it isn't just good because it wasn't a train wreck.  It would be good if this was any band pulling off this kind of sound in this day and age.  It is that good and it took me a while to figure out why it was good and why I didn't like Tattoo the first time I heard it.  It was because I had not heard this kind of rock music in years.  They just didn't play it on the radio anymore.  The second thing I realized was this music was different than most hard rock today because it didn't take itself too seriously.  There isn't a depressed lead singer singing about how awful his life is.  The last thing that makes this album so good is because it is just plain fun.  Fun is something that is missing in a lot of music these days and these guys brought it back like it was 1978. No review on specific songs, I actually like them all.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|This may be the most literal film adaptation of a print property we'll ever see, but that alone can't make it half as successful as it could have been. Having grown up with the trade paperback by my bedside, a holy grail of sorts for comic book fanatics, it's almost a religious experience to see these themes, characters and visuals represented so loyally on the big screen. As he did with 300, Zac Snyder has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the comics, breathtakingly, but underneath that dazzling surface is a terrible lack of soul, conviction and character. With the exception of Jackie Earl Haley, who is absolutely magnificent as the mentally teetering vigilante Rorschach, this is a large collection of miscast characters which never really seem to buy into what they're saying or doing. The words are right, ripped line-for-line from the bubbles and narrative boxes of the comics, and of course everyone looks great, but bland inflections, bad interpretations and a hectic, compressed timeframe strip away the power of the plot's weightiest moments. In a way it's TOO loyal, as it's surprisingly the one major moment that steps away from the guiding hands of the source material - a significant tweak to the story's conclusion - that works the best. Snyder was ambitious to tackle such a booby-trapped property, and to do so with such a passionate love for its roots is admirable, but there's a reason it was dubbed unfilmable for so many years. There's so much going on at any given moment that even the most familiar reader runs the risk of being bucked, and even at three hours, a large portion of the story is left on the cutting room floor. And for Watchmen, those seemingly-dispensible character moments are every bit as important as the heaviest plot developments. A valiant effort, but ultimately a failed one.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Excellent movie, I was not disappointed and was quite pleased with their handling of the film. I was thoroughly engrossed in this film and does justice to ERB. Don't know what movie the critics saw but this is definately the best film I've seen in a very long time. I've read all the novels and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Disney should have done a better job marketing this film. This film ended up being my favorite film of 2012 and the best since Avatar which is loosely based on the novels. Some of the best films are not money makers whereas some of the worst films are.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been looking for a good bible app that would allow me to choose the version that I'm used to. This app not only has my version but let's me quickly compare verses from many different versions. The reading plans are an unexpected bonus. They are easy to follow and vary in length, theme and seasonal applications. I have this app on my Driod X and Samsung Galaxy tablet. I even use the web version on my PC. I love the bookmark feature too. It has been many years since I have sat down to read the Scriptures. Now I can't imagine a day where I don't dedicate some time to reflecting on the Word and strengthening my relationship with God.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found the last half of the book a little cheeky -- like lame, predictable, action movie cheeky:    ***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT***    The kidnap, the ransom, the face-to-face pivtotal moment when she shoots the villain -- blah, blah, blah.    MAYBE if they did it a little differently. Maybe a bank robbery that didn't necessarily just focus on Ana and Mia. They just had TOO MUCH drama -- stalkers, kidnappers, break-ins, car accidents. Like REALLY? Hahahaha!    I created a fan page:  [...]
B006OT03BM|5.0|As a big fan of transformers I had to order one of these. When I received iti was very happy it looks absolutely fantastic. I will say anyone who buys it be aware when you pull the tape holding the discs down do it very slowly as mine took some of the colour off the disc amazon were extremely helpful with this though. I would hilly recommend this to anyone who enjoys transformers or just wants a really cool collectors piece. Well worth the money. I may even buy another.<br /><br />The whole box is shipped exceptionally by amazon probably the best packaging I have ever seen by them rest assured there will be no damage during shipping. The item itself is very strong and the discs are held very securely. It is presented wonderfully and the signature and film cell just add that much more to it making it a must have for any collector. There are also spare screws for the film cell which from what I understand can be used to remove the film cell from the box and be shown as a separate piece.<br /><br />Overall a great product I am very impressed and happy with what has been done. Great job by Michael Bay and all involved

B004LWZW8I|1.0|What this movie needs more than anything is a light bulb. At least then you could see the movie and hate it more intelligently. Even in the dark it's obvious this screenplay makes very little sense. The \\"Hellenics\\" (re: Greeks) live in homes cut out of cliffs that the Anasazi would have regarded as remote and uninhabitable. They apparently survive on rocks since there is no visible food or water source. Here's a thought;<br />There's not a tree in the entire movie.<br />The color green does not exist.<br />This movie didn't need to.
B006470HZ6|5.0|This season started off a bit slowish (though still intriguing), but culminated with a bang and left me hanging on with anticipation for Season 3.

B005FITIK0|4.0|Charlize Theron is a young adult fiction writer. In the first few minutes of the movie, her character is ingeniously established by showing us glimpses of her morning routine. She has an idea to return to her small hometown in Mercury, Minn. to rekindle a romance with a man who is happily married with a baby. Theron was fantastic in her role. She meets an old friend Matt (Patton Oswalt) who she remembers as \\"the hate crime kid\\" because a group of jocks beat him up believing he was gay. The only thing that was hit harder was Theron's liver who is an excessive drinker.<br /><br />The irony of the film is that Theron is trapped by her own life, but doesn't realize it. She in turn believes ex-bf Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) is the one who is trapped because he is married and is saddled with a kid. Theron projects herself into the main character of her current novel. She has been influenced by the romance authors where the two people who were meant for each other come together in the end although such is not the case in life.<br /><br />The script is as predictable as a low budget Indie. My biggest problem is that the film drops off too much after the climax scene. It needed about 5-10 more minutes to have given it proper closure. I will say it again. Theron was great.<br /><br />F-bomb, implied sex, no real nudity. Patton Oswalt without his shirt.
1601253788|4.0|Like the first and second books in the bestiaries the third book in the series features great art and a slew of monsters that populate Paizo created worlds with some old favorites from the former best selling adventure publisher TSR repackaged and face lifted. It is excellent overall, but to me there is not much in it one could not live without, but many people will find the creatures from other real world mythologies interesting. A lot of the creatures are simply elemental or environmental variations like giant rabbit, giant fanged magma rabbit, giant fanged snow rabbit, giant fanged desert rabbit, giant fanged cave rabbit. Just kidding about the rabbit, but you will find this in actuality with dragons and trolls at least. This book would be very helpful for gamers who like high levels of play. Glad to add it to my collection, but a lot of the monsters here are in their other supplements.

B005LAIGZU|2.0|There is a reason people like movies and TV shows with actors in them. It because you get really engaged in the characters because actors bring them to life. When u have really navy SEALs in the movie the execution of all of the tactical stuff is all accurate but the plot line and the horrible acting at every no actions sequence makes is almost painful to watch. The movie feels like a really long add to join the US NAVY, only you paid to watch the movie instead of it interrupting a TV show. While it was a good idea and possibly a fresh approach to war movies it didnt turn out well and is certainly not going to be known in the future as one of the better war movies.

Palacio was a remarkable read. I must say Ms. Palacio that I have never read a novel that was simply unique, wonderful and very exceptionalall rolled up on one. Simply the novel was all of that and more! It was one of a kind! This book is for all.... children, teenagers and adults will enjoy this wonderful read. The author told this story beautifully. It was a read that I could not put down until I had finished.<br /><br />August (Auggie) was born with an unknown birth defect, having over twenty-five surgeries... was now ten years old and never had been to school. Auggie had been home schooled by his Mom. Now, his parents decided it was time for him to go to school ... so as a fifth grader he is now attending his first year of middle school at Beecher Prep. What will he encounter in the school and how Auggie handles situations are only left for you to read this wonderful read. I really liked the way the author was able to present Augie who was prepared to take on life and not feel sorry for himself.<br /><br />The characters.... all of them were great in their deliverance of the story.... especially August (Auggie) sister, Via, Summer, Jack, Mr. Browne, and Mr. Tushman (only to name a few).... Truly, I would brought to tears at some of the emotions that were played out in this read. There was one sentence that I liked and it was ...a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary.... in our everyday life do we do this? Definitely our world would be a much better place if we were more kinder to each other!<br /><br />With the love his Auggie's family, friends support and all the goodness that can be really found in people, one can clearly see Auggie for who he is and not for just what he looks like. Truly Auggie deserved to win the Henry Ward Beecher medal. WoW! and the saying... \\"I'm just me. An ordinary Kid.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wonder\\" was a amazing novel and I would like to recommend this read to all.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I truly enjoyed all three books, and was happy to read the trilogy as one continuous story.  I won't rehash the other reviews and only will add that I found the books to be very well written with a good amount of time spent on character development.  The reader truly gets to know the characters on a more emotional level than you can in the movie.  While the movie was decent, it provides yet another example of why books are superior in their ability to engage the audience.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I missed out on these two games when i had a ps2. Now that they are on the ps3 i definitely wanted to check this collection out I was a disappointed in Ico as the game hasn't really aged well the A.I is extremely clunky and the controls and fighting is terrible, but the game's story, environment is truly a marvel. For Shadow of the Colossus, this game is FANTASTIC. The game is miles better than Ico, the fighting is much improved on and the open world is a perfect setting for the story. The boss battles blew my mind when i fought the first colossus for the first time. I recommend this collection for any PS3 gamer and those who had missed out on them like me

B00014X8KO|4.0|I did not know when I purchased this that there were no dubs included.  As an Anime viewer, I am not a fan of subtitles.  I know for hardcore extremists dubs are sacrilege.  But I hate reading when I am watching a movie.<br /><br />That being said I still enjoyed this 3 movie series.  Each one is radically different from the next.  I especially enjoyed the one about the city that is constantly launching bombs at another city.  Forgive me the names are all excluding me at this time...<br /><br />There was a message in the bombing movie.  The message was that people can be sweapt up by their governments.  That they can be performing functions and not really know why.  It showed that children are sometimes the only ones with patriotism, that adults all lose this empty feeling.  That if no one asks questions and just plays their role, governments will continue to use them.<br /><br />The other two movies were good.  One is about a guy who after an accident becomes a walking toxic nightmare.  The other is a disaster in space drama.<br /><br />All three were pretty good and as long as you don't mind subtitles, I would with reservation say you would like \\"Memories.\\"<br /><br />-Hope this helps.
0307719219|2.0|I am an avid reader of economics, politics, and history. this book is plainly extremely boring!!!!! i wouldn't advise anyone to read it.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|As soon as I got my DVD, I suspected it as being a fake, and the first disc was scratched beyond use. I returned the disc to Amazon (no problems with the return). I bought a new copy at Best Buy - and it's completely different! The inside disc holders should be dark blue, there is no insert, printing should be very crisp and on glossy cardstock. Discs should have very clear printing as well. The fake was a VERY good fake, hard to tell, but my suspicions were correct.<br /><br />As for the show - it's brilliant. I love it. The actors are great, and although I was sad to see David Tennant go, Matt Smith is doing a smashingly amazing job at being the Doctor. And I don't think I've like any companions so far as much as I like Amy Pond and Rory Williams.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Best movie, the whole movie is awesome mind bending, along with amazing graphics<br />The experience blow my mind<br /> wake up world, ur turn.

B00729GQ0A|1.0|The free chapters posted online were quite good.  So I bought the book.<br /><br />I have no idea what happened.  Shortly after the free chapters the tone of the book changes.  Okay, I thought, keep reading.  Maybe it is just a temporary lapse.<br /><br />It just got worse and worse.  Sophia is ineffectual and kind of pointless in the beginning of the book, but she is young and one expects the character to progress as the book continues.  (I, for one, assumed she could not get any more asinine and the only way was up.)  But for some reason Sophia did not grow and mature.  Instead she became steadily more and more annoying.  And stupid - every decision she made was more stupid than the last.  And the whining - the endless, monotonous whining as she created more and more problems for herself.  Charles is obviously a masochist, desparately searching for more pain and pointless stupidity in his life.  And he found it in Sophia.<br /><br />I could not finish reading the book.  It got that bad.  And it was not just Sophia.  The plot became more and more idiotic.  SPOILERS (in case you are silly enough to want to read this book after being warned.)<br /><br />Did you know that if you are asleep in your house, and the lunatic that has been harrassing you sets the house on fire, then collapses outside - YOU will be arrested?  Yes, apparently the police in this book are as stupid as Sophia.  Oh, and after it is sorted out and you are set free by the police, nothing happens to the person who tried to kill you in your sleep, and that will not bother you.  That's how it works in Stupidville - arsonist does not go to prison, does not get arrested - nothing.  Oh, and when your house is burned down, and you have no insurance, and you sell the land for a fraction of the value of the house, it is no big deal.  Not if you are a vapid twit named Sophia.<br /><br />This was the point at which I gave up in disgust.  It was so bad it set my teeth on edge.<br /><br />This is probably tolerable if you are very young and don't know any better.  Fourteen, maybe?<br /><br />The writer is young.  Maybe she will join a writing group and somebody will help her come up with a plot that is not an endless plothole, and a protagonist who is not a whining self-involved waste of space.  Stranger things have happened.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|Guess this means I can delete the sideloaded version on my Fire now that an official version is available from Amazon.<br /><br />This music player is essential if you use the iSyncer app to synch your android device with iTunes. It is the only one I've found the supports updating plays and ratings thus allowing you to take full advantage of smart playlists without having to buy an iThing. This app was the reason I learned how to sideload apps onto my recently purchased Kindle Fire and now it is officially supported.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This was a great follow up to an amazing first book.  A seamless transition of the story.  I thought the author did a great job keeping our interest the whole way through.  I plan to read the third book for sure.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|First of all I don't understand why some people are so upset about having 2 worlds For you people who did not notice it says in the description that there will be regular free updates that means that there should probably be new worlds.because that is what ROVIO did in the other angry birds games. Otherwise this is a good game I bought it the day it came out because on the original angry birds it was about 1 dollar without updates now it is 5 dollars with 6 or 7 worlds. I gave it 5 stars because it is a fun app and it is cool that you can mess with the gravity I also highly recommend the other angry birds apps.
B005LAJ23A|3.0|Or in another words: \\"why is this still an issue?\\" Is how I would explain this Blu-Ray release.<br />I'm sure the HD quality of Blu-Ray is the best way to watch the only prime time show about the Zombie Apocalypse, but it comes at a very slow narrative price. The first season of The Walking Dead was perfect. I will not waste time saying that because I had an absolute blast watching it the first two or three times. I was okay with the differences from the comic vs TV show in the short 7 episode season.<br /><br />So naturally I was excited that season 2 was going to be longer with 13 episodes. Let's just say the confusion of Frank Darabont and other writers leaving didn't help the narrative situation. What they left before the mid season break was an absolute boring narrative that could be explained in 5 seconds, literally. I hate to be the reviewer that thinks this, but \\"This show does have zombies, right?\\" And yes, as a fan of the comics, I understand that it's not just about that, it's about how the main characters survive. It's neat to see the integration of Hershel, Maggie, and the farm come into the story, but that was it. After the mid season break, new writers and directors came into play allowing the story to progress a bit faster this time. However, after the drudgery of \\"Where's Sofia!?\\" God, it was hard to recover from that because the Walking Dead was becoming a chore to watch. And it should never be that! Jon Bernthal's acting was starting to get redundant with the constant head bobbing while talking approach. I'm from the south and I guarantee that not all of us talk to you like we have serious ADD problems. I had 0 issues with the 7 episodes of Shane in the first season. But the entirety of the second season of Head-bobbing dialogue? siiiiigh. My wife and I were yelling at the TV \\"WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD YET?!\\" Even Andrew Lincoln didn't help with his acting method.<br /><br />However, the final 6 episodes did start moving in a better direction. Even though it was in a meandering path having the same issues of moving the narrative forward, it did get better. So Walking Dead or zombie horror fans, by all means, add this to your collection. You are still viewing probably the best if not only way the Zombie Apocalypse can be shown on Prime Time Television. Just expect this to be a boring chapter compared to Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore/Charlie Adlard's version. By the end of season two, just hope the show moves the narrative forward at an entertaining pace, not a stagnant one.gh it was in a meandering path having the same issues of moving the narrative forward, it did get better.

B0055SWM08|4.0|not what I thought if was, but still super fun and addictive. it reminds me of angry birds in a way.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Was really easy to follow and kept my attention. Read all three books in a few days would recommend them to anyone.
B002ZG9800|4.0|Ewan McGregor kept me watching this film. An enjoyable account of a true story. The story of two fraudsters in Texas and their stints in and out of prison. The film is quite funny in places and it passed an hour and a half away. Not the best film I've ever seen and not the worst either.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love the new planets!!! Can't wait for the update!!! I wish I had been able to use the egg bird at least once, but I love the game and can't wait to play more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|You just can't beat the classics. Uses your brain and reasoning. App works smoothly without hesitation.  Recommend to and for all ages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I like the fact that when I don't understand the wording, I have the option of changing the translation :)
B005OHSNMG|5.0|I find myself laughing uncontrollably at every episode of this show.  The cast chemistry is fantastic and the writers are really on point in capturing the conversations and personalities of these single thirty-somethings.  I cannot WAIT to buy this on DVD.
0446571415|1.0|I read about 100 pages and got real bored. Same stuff about the ALPHABET agencies tripping over and stabbing each other in the backs. Sorry, David and his fans, but no more Camel Club books for me.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is fun. I enjoy it very much. It has an interesting dynamic, one minute its frustratingly difficult the next its as easy as field dressing a rabbit without a knife. Regardless, its a great time killer when you're on the crapper.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|I downloaded Doodle God first and then someone told me if I liked Doodle.God, I would love alchemy. not quite TRUE! this game is much more frustrating. no hints to help you get unstuck and impossible to keep track of what combinations you. have already TRIED!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have mixed feelings about this book, about this series. Seeds from the earlier books sprout wishful images of satisfying revenge in the third. Yet author Suzanne Collins takes a different route.  Maybe a smart move as her choice certainly aligns with a real world. But this does undermine the goal that builds up in the reader's mind. Now, for a minute just forget that most of this book is beautifully visual and imaginative because I'm going to nitpick it.<br /><br />Author Collins also spends a good part of this third book debasing Katniss, making her selfish, unmotivated, and lacking insight. Even when the author kicks her protagonist into gear, she can't for some reason pen her girl to really unleash the warrior within. Despite the supporting cast of characters belief in Katniss, the would be heroine wallows in self doubt and mis-directed anger, sometimes sparked by the most innocuous comment by Gale or Peeta or Haymitch. Because the would be heroine never truly believes in herself, the author makes Katniss' belief the book's outcome. While this flawed character is really the way we humans are, it flew against my thespian need for satisfaction.<br /><br />There are also a few very jarring editorial jumps, one in particular pulled me out of the book and caused me to reread for fifteen minutes prior pages, trying to locate where I'd missed an ultra important part of the narrative. I hadn't missed anything, it transpired. It was just an awful, throwaway reveal.  I don't want to put SPOILERS here on something so incredibly important. I'll only say that's it's to do with firebombing.<br /><br />Now that I've consumed all three books, even though overall I've been spellbound, I honestly feel this might have been better as a single volume, without the extra padding and fluff that drove into a trilogy. Still, I read all 3 books in 4 consecutive days. That must tell you something. Color and imagination trump nitpicking.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|This book is not ground breaking rocket science, but definitely an intimate look into the pressures that young actresses in Hollywood must face on a daily basis. Even though Rossi is gorgeous and talented, she suffers from some of the lowest self-esteem you can imagine.  She writes beautifully and extremely candidly, bringing you into a world that you have always heard about, but never really knew the true story.  Great book and interesting read.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I was really excited on the day I got the bug in my ear that I should be running my own engineering firm.  Then I heard the suggestion that I read The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber, and I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />The book puts in simple, conversational terms the mindset you need to run a successful business AND the process you need to go through to create it. The tone is respectful of people who have valuable technical skills that want to see that value realized, but the book very quickly warns the reader that doing the work is very different from owning a business that does the work, and there are a number of problems the technical person often never sees coming until it's too late.<br /><br />Far from deterring me from entering the business world, this book has me more excited than ever about asking the questions and setting up the systems that allow a great business to function.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The most recent update ruined the app on my smartphone, it now forces itself to close before I can even start reading.  Used to love and use the app daily. This SUCKS!  PLEASE FIX!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I typically have problems finishing books. I start one and never finish it. This wasn't the case with this book though, after I finished the first book in this edition, I didn't want to carry on. Then I just forced myself to start the second book and didn't want to put it down afterwards. The book continually gripped me by the balls and forced me to read. I actually lost a hour of sleep a few days ago due to a cliff hanger. I finished the book in less than a week and am glad I did. The end of the book left on a semi-cliff hanger though and can't wait till the 6th book is published. Not anything all that important but that one detail would be nice to know. Well I will be buying the 6th book as soon as it comes out.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this case it's very slim form fitting, doesn't add any extra  bulk. The thing I really like about this case is that the front flap will easily fold over flush with the back, so that its not cumbersome to hold when the case is open. Also the stand part  of the case works very well, surprisingly i use that more than i thought i would.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The front cover is kind of thin, however plenty of protection. Unless you plan on throwing the device around.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|My English is not good, but it makes me sad that the story has used the name of God or Jesus Christ to humiliate, defile, kill. In Mexico, too, the Spanish and Inqusicion, killed thousands, as many Jews as Mexican Indian, also burned books. Just as Alexandria, happened in Mexico and in many other cities in America.
0439023521|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book! The idea of being able to purchase all three instantly over kindle for just over $15 is quite amazing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Despite being an avid sci-fi reader, I rarely offer reviews.<br /><br />The bad: isn't very bad, but I feel obligated to mention it. The first book felt slow and overly detailed, causing me to speed-read, yet I would have still given it a four. It was the first of the author's work I had read.<br /><br />The good: When I read the rest of the books, I finished reading them in two work days (evening and night) and I no longer felt lost. There was more action in the remaining books (the pace only increases as you read through the series, which I think was intentional), and I subconsciously became accustomed to the writer's style. When I reached the end of the latest publication, I felt like I was coming up for air. The world seemed a bit strange. This is a sure sign that I was drawn into the story to a great degree. Very few books accomplish this for me anymore, much less series. I currently read roughly 200 books a year (an increase now that I no longer have to worry about what to do with roomfuls of paperbacks), am about 40 years old, have two decades of sci-fi reading succeeding a decade of western and a decade of fantasy reading. I still enjoy the occasional \\"spy\\", fantasy or alternative reading, and consume roughly 5 research or textbooks a year. For me to get lost in a story requires an exceptionally fresh approach and a depth of reasonable, unusual and intriguing philosophy... and this series is amazing.<br /><br />Whether on purpose or not, I forsee this style of writing becoming the new standard in self-published eBooks. A short, well-written story for the first, then progressively longer stories as the series progresses. This is an effective approach because it lets the author write in an informed loop based on reader feedback. It is similar to a movie trailer, yet is a story unto itself rather than just a single chapter.<br /><br />I wish to express heartfelt appreciation for such quality writing... and the grammar was impeccable. Grammar is an absolute must for a reader to get absorbed in the story- a lesson that *most* of the self-publishers (and even several paper-published authors) have yet to learn. I believe the greatest contribution this author will have made in the years to come is the feedback loop of shorter to longer stories in a series (new writers better learn it... or else). Yet, I also have to say that the story itself is truely a classic. My children can read this story 10 and 20 years from now and it will still be thought-provoking and absorbing, no matter what new fads come into play.<br /><br />Kudos.for a reader to get absorbed in the story- a lesson that *most* of the self-publishers (and even several paper-published authors) have yet to learn.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy the challenge, you can't just move ahead you have to master and meet requirements. It feels good when I am able to move on. I can't wait to unlock the other games. Great app to kill time in a line or if your on hold. Quick games.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|So, not only do you get the joy of pointing the item at random doors and pretending you've sonicly unlocked it, there is something very very special about being able to scrawl \\"BAD WOLF\\" on your arm and reveal it only through the UV light at the top.<br /><br />I do think that the 11th doctor's screwdriver is more substantial as this one really feels like you're holding a plastic toy rather than a real sonic screwdriver (what more can you expect, though.) The UV pen nib makes up for the low quality materials, though.
B007N6EUHI|3.0|Its a good app for looking at the body but no quiz or test options. If it had a way to do that it would be worth the price and worth 5 stars.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I maybe late in getting my two-cents in but I'm putting them in. The book is definitely misplaced as a Young Adult genre since children killing children as a government mandate entails a lot of explanations to young adults. As a cautionary tale this is just a retelling of events in the past and maybe the present times where the lessons in bureaucracy and hierarchy are never learned. Individual independence is probably a sign of self-possession but living in a collective is a worst state because it always tends to become a pyramid with all the levels and weak points.<br /><br />\\"We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.\\"---Plutarch

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The most state-of-the-art Beatles recording ever presents George Martin as crucial collaborator at his most pristine. Though they work purely as sound, Martin can't fully redeem \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" from their own triviality. But those are the only low points and the Beatles performances from start to finish can claim to stand equal to Martin's production techniques.<br /><br />The double A-sided single, \\"Come Together\\", is John at his idiosyncratic best with a funky groove and \\"Something\\" is George's most mature view at romance. As commanding as they are, marginally tastier treats await. John's \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" displays his lyrically minimalist approach built on a repetitive proto-metal blues riff. His ardent vocal spells out his obsession and the band pays its debt to progressive rock with hypnotic flair. George's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" evokes warmth with its vibrant melody and those exquisite three-part harmonies. It's probably my favorite cut on the album. Score one for George! Paul's standout, \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", exhibits his rarely-used tone at satire in which he faces financial anxiety. Melt to those gorgeous harmonies.<br /><br />But it's up to those two closing medleys of mostly quirky fragments that give this record its identity. Highlights include the aggressive rock of \\"Polythene Pam\\" and the fun-ridden blast of Ringo's drum solo with the triple-guitar heaven that slides into the philosophical equation of \\"The End\\". There's nothing that could be a more organic conclusion to their partnership.<br /><br />It's really amazing that a group knowingly splitting up could care enough to band one last time to create something unique to their legacy. But the Beatles have always been on the cutting edge as evidenced here by some of the earliest uses of the Moog synthesizer. What leaders!
1577314808|1.0|The quotation at the front of the book says it all.  How many serious authors quote themselves?  And the body of the book is just as ridiculous.  I have read many translations and commentaries on Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian philosophy, including the Dhammapada, Bhagavad Gita, and The Cloud of Unknowing.  This guy's philosophy is essentially a mash-up of everything that has come before, but his writing style is so pedantic and self-congratulatory, it's a slog to get through it.  Read the original thinkers and skip this pretender.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great to pass the time! the games are some what<br />challenging as well. I recommend this to everyone! fast and fun
B002BWP49C|5.0|I totally loved this movie--have seen it many times, as well as all of the other Twilight movies.  The wedding scene was just beautiful, the birth scene was just exactly how I pictured it from the book.<br /><br />For those of you who were disappointed, please remember that all movies based on a novel are just adaptations, not the entire novel.  Reading the books just fills in the background info.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Is it word for word Edgar Rice Burroughs? No. But if anyone has read the books they would know that it probably would not transfer directly to the screen as is. What we get is a thrilling epic with creatures, warriors, battles, a princess, ships and everything that in between. Everything came from this. This was the original source for almost all sci-fi adventure. Bow before the master of adventure.... Edgar Rice Burroughs!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|there is an update available that can't be downloaded thru the Android Market.  I enjoy this game and it's similar to Alchemy.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've enjoyed contemporary fiction this much!  Thanks Hugh Howie!<br /><br />This is a well written, engaging, thought provoking, \\"page-turner\\" about a post-apocalyptic world.  You can read the description yourself and saying anything more would give too much away.  I happen to love stories set in a post-apocalyptic world - was SUPER DISAPPOINTED in the Hunger Games and haven't really found/read anything else that I could even compare with Wool in contemporary fiction.  (As an aside, I really liked the wool/knitting theme subtly worked into the first few books.)  Characters and diaglogue are believeable and relate-able - I'm fairly impressed with Howie's success at writing female characters (despite not being one himself) as it can be a tricky thing to do.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to a future of reading Hugh Howie books (I've already started reading his Molly Fyde series and am thoroughly enjoying that too - even though I've never read books in that genre - I'm glad I started reading Molly Fyde).  So check that out when you're done with Wool.<br /><br />Don't overthink it, their cheap (or free with Prime) - just give Wool a try, you'll be hooked after the first book.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|This is a decent game but it doesn't handle opening and closing the game well and is plagued by game save resets. Any notification on your phone or any time the screen is turned off the game will stop and have to reload.  Hopefully the developer does something to fix the horrible game reset as well. I would get a refund if I still could.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|One of the funniest new sitcoms to come along since the heyday of Seinfeld and Friends. With an amazing cast of characters who play off each other like they are actually the friends and nerdy companions they portray, it's the perfect combination of silliness, sincerity, and emotional satisfaction that makes a TV show worth watching over and over. I don't buy too many DVDs of TV shows since they play endlessly in syndication, but The Big Bang Theory holds a permanent place in my heart and on my bookshelf where I can enjoy it anytime I want to get my geek on. Two thumbs up from this fan.

Especially Christian, who has believed throughout this entire adventure that he is not worthy of Ana!<br /><br />Undeniably, the title of this book is truly apropos for the conclusion in the fact that both characters come full circle and eventually free themselves from all deficiencies and inadequacies in their relationship and recognize wholeheartedly that they truly love one another unconditionally. In fact, in this story, they've matured to the point that Christian shares all his innermost darkest feelings and secrets of his past with Ana. And in return, Ana has relinquished her insecurities about not being able to fulfill all of Christian's needs.<br /><br />Essentially, it feels like the relationship they were developing from the previous two books (you know, that intense feeling in the honeymoon phase of a relationship that consists of jealousy, control, lust, unknown, and abandonment), has blossomed into one the most passionate unions two people could ever possess...the kind of unconditional love that is immeasurable and for eternity!<br /><br />Undeniably, this happily-ever-after will leave the reader totally breathless. It is one of the most beautifully written, sexually erogenous love stories ever read. Take the journey yourself and feel the emotions...truly an unbelievable experience! Highly recommend!
B007K7K3TO|3.0|FYI everyone, the song When the Wild Wind Blows is not 16:35 in length - it's 10:37. At first I figured they did an extra 5-minute solo in it!<br /><br />At the same time, did they really have to make that track - the best on the album - an 'album only' purchase? Certainly a non-consumer friendly business decision for those who only wanted the newer songs from this live album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second installment of the Fifty Shades Trilogy continues the relationship development of Christian and Anastasia (Ana). While the first book ended with Ana breaking up with Christian, this Part 2 of the series have them reuniting with more intensity and love than one could ever imagine. In fact, they both profoundly profess their love for each other. But this time around, it is more alarmingly intensified because now neither one will be able to live without the other; it would be mass destruction on both their existence if they ever parted again.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Christian and Ana have grown to unconditionally love each other with their entire being --body, mind and soul. The love is so breathtakingly forceful that the reader will not be able to turn the pages fast enough. And with each page turned, there is even more suspenseful intensity that will leave you awe-stricken. For you see, in this narrative, Ana will face every single dark corner of Christian's wicked past, and she will endure it with so much strength, passion, and love.<br /><br />This is truly an out-of-this-world erotic love story; one that will be imbedded in the mind for some time. With the erogenous synchronization both Ana and Christian execute throughout this second act, coupled with the intense drama and suspense, it just makes for one absolutely fabulous journey into the depths of their stimulating sexually desirous feelings of love. What is more, this love will unite both beings into one whole existence with that happily-ever-after sensation. Extraordinarily delicious read! Highly Recommend!<br /><br />Essentially, this could be the conclusion to the trilogy if it were not for the fact that there is one remaining installment. And if you're addicted as I, you will want to experience what could possibly occur next with the conclusion of the trilogy in \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\". So, off to read the conclusion...

B001UV4XFG|4.0|Whether you are thirteen or ninety-five, there's no doubt you have heard of Twilight. And if you have bothered to read the books or see the films, you have already decided whether or not you love or loathe the franchise. Eclipse is the latest in the film series...<br /><br />If it is the last thing she ever does, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is going to make Bella (Kristen Stewart) pay for the death of her mate. The spirited, fiery-haired vampire is no match for the local band of werewolves and vampires who protect Bella, so she takes matters into her own hands and recruits Riley (Xavier Samuel) to assist her in raising an army. In the meantime, unaware of the danger, Bella is caught between her immortal potential lovers -- the physically cold but romantic vampire, Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the warm-blooded, spirited shape-shifting werewolf, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). While she is devoted to Edward, the rift that it has caused with Jacob leaves a hole in her life, an emotional gulf at the fact that the two young men cannot come to terms. Torn between her intention to leave everything she knows behind and become an immortal, but knowing that will separate her from Jacob forever, Bella faces a new series of choices and situations when it becomes apparent that her life is in peril.<br /><br />Considered one of the most popular franchises of our time, Eclipse is the best film in the Twilight series. With a new director comes a much larger scale outlook on the production, with picturesque settings and breathtaking views. There are a few more battle scenes this time around and subtle attempts at humor. The acting still suffers from occasional stiffness, but many of the sequences have an additional charm and it's nice to see some of the back stories and histories of individual characters. Here, we visit Rosalie, Jasper, and the first shape-shifter's past, as well as encounter more of the Italian vampires that made such an impression in the second film. Bryce is aworthy replacement for the previous Victoria and lends a bit of sass to the film, which still relies heavily on the romantic triangle but does branch out into some good arguments for why Bella should be cautious in her decision. No doubt these will not sway devoted fans from one opinion to the other, but for a undecided like me it tended to send me in a shall we say, wolfier direction.<br /><br />The flashbacks are done well, and the musical score is great. The only real complaint in terms of filmmaking that I have is early action scenes are so rapidly shot and cut that it is difficult to tell what is happening. There's also an extraordinary amount of close-ups. For long time fans it is solid improvement on the success of the previous two films. I was sorry not to have seen more of the Cullens as individuals, but their limited screen time did provide some further insight into their characters, and the audience is introduced to some of the names and faces that become important in later incidents. While I might take issue with some of the underlining messages (more prominent in literature than on film), I do have to applaud this series for its stance on abstinence and its decision to respect the \\"outdated\\" notion of marriage. At one point, Edward says the divorce rate between vampires is far less than humans. It's a life-long commitment (or in this case, eternity) that is taken with the utmost seriousness.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|I was surprised when I turned on this movie to see a spaceship hurtling through the atmosphere, for glancing at the summary for the film on my online rental queue, it seemed like a costume drama. I almost turned it off after ten minutes but decided to stick with it a little longer and am glad I did. I'm not sure why Outlander didn't have a wide release and generate a substantial following, since it has all the elements needed for a great action film.<br /><br />During the reign of the Vikings, a stranger from a distant land crashes in the middle of the lake. Kainan (James Caviezel) is haunted by the past but disconcerted to discover that his arrival coincides with the appearance of a new creature in the wood, a fire-breathing dragon-like lizard known as a Moorwen. At first he is believed to have had something to do with the murder of a neighboring village, but when he reveals knowledge of the dragon, he is taken before King Rothgar (John Hurt). Born of a dominating space race of super-advanced humans, Kainan inadvertently released the Moorwen from his ship when it went down. Now charged with the responsibility of helping hunt down and kill the monster he has unleashed on the Vikings, he finds an unlikely friendship with the future king, the courageous but somewhat rash Wulfric (Jack Hudson).<br /><br />Rothgar's daughter Freya (Sophia Myles) is intrigued by this newcomer but as their first encounter included him knocking her unconscious, is not entirely convinced of his goodness, but as she comes to know him better, a flicker of romance ignites that might be threatened by the seemingly impossible task of destroying the Moorwen before it wipes them out. I confess that the first few minutes were rather strange and you would think sci-fi would not blend well in a middle ages setting, but I was surprised not only how quickly it convinced me of it, but what a fun movie it turned out to be. The characters are all interesting and likable in their own way. I was impressed with Wulfric in particular, since he could have easily been a \\"villainous\\" sort of character, but he is quick to accept Kainan and they even become friends. Their rivalry extends no further than a particularly amusing dinner scene in which they attempt to outdo one another's antics through various depictions of their battle skills.<br /><br />Another thing I liked was that the romance was never too much or overstated -- it is there, and the audience appreciates it, but it's not overly important to the story so much as assists in building background. There's also a young boy that Kainan befriends whose cute, dirt-covered face made me smile. The acting is all very good, the special effects are tremendous, and the Moorwen is more than simply a blundering beast. One gets the impression that it is not a \\"dumb animal\\" but knows what it is doing, and is intentionally paying back Kainan for previous sins. In that respect, I must confess to experiencing some sadness for it, since essentially it is making a bid for survival as much as revenge. This may weaken the driving impulse of the film for some, but made it a multi-layered experience for me. The costumes and the music are also quite good, and I cannot stress enough how much I loved our introduction to Freya -- engaging in a practice swordfight with her father, while arguing about whether or not she will marry Wulfric.<br /><br />Overall, I was surprised how good the movie was. It was thoroughly enjoyable with moments of adventure, humor, and just enough mushiness to satisfy both genres, but I suspect that the violence might be a bit off-putting. Excellent for fans of an unusual genre, but not for everyone.

B001HN697M|3.0|Humans live under the protection of vampire warlords who have managed to keep the surrounding territory's murderous werewolves at bay through sheer brutality. Once bitten, mortals transform into mindless beasts without the ability to return to their former form... until Lucian is born, a powerful hybrid who can control his shape-shifting at will. Using his genetics, Viktor (Bill Nighy) creates a new breed of werewolf known as Lycans, who serve the vampires as daylight guardians. Enslaved and heavily guarded, the Lycans dream of freedom and a privileged few are trusted intimately by their masters. Among them is Lucian (Michael Sheen), whose loyalty is proven and whose love belongs to Viktor's beautiful daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). Spirited and rebellious against her father's authority, Sonja constantly bends the rules and places herself in peril.<br /><br />In order to prevent her from being killed, Lucian commits the cardinal rule of his race -- he removes his slave collar, transforms into a beast, and defends her. Viktor is infuriated with this obvious contempt for the rules and condemns him to be punished and his privileges revoked. This prompts Lucian to make a bid for freedom, little realizing what -- and who -- is at stake. Audiences familiar with the original films and characters will know various plot twists before they transpire on-screen, but it's also a reasonable introduction to the franchise for new fans, as it establishes all the main threads and individuals who become important later on. I love that we were allowed to see into an earlier era before the Lycans obtained freedom from the vampires. Lucian has never been a favorite but watching his story unfold gave me greater compassion for him. It was also a pleasure to see Viktor in his element, since he makes only brief but impacting appearances in earlier productions. My only disappointment was that while Marcus' storyline was fleshed out in the second film, the other Elder has not been fully explored. Amelia does not even make an appearance, which is a shame.<br /><br />The purpose of the franchise is to create a surreal existence in which two immortal forces are locked in eternal warfare. This film is the origins of that notorious rivalry and while there are moments of inconsistency with the sequels, it is arguably the best of the franchise. Its setting in the middle ages is more compelling and epic than the modern day interpretation where vampires run around with silver bullets. The costume design is somewhat overlooked but if you care to watch for details you will see some exquisite examples of period work in the luxurious coats and rich fabrics. One friend commented that in some respects, it is the werewolf version of Bravheart and there is a mild resemblance in Lucian's stirring speeches and underdog battle against the establishment ... but the vampires are not one-sided either. Everyone has motivations and reasons for their actions and so it's very difficult to completely choose a side. The look of the film in particular is magnificent -- very gothic and ghostly, from pale vampires to darkened forest lanes. There are no automatic weapons here, just broadswords and a few mean fighting sequences.<br /><br />This film has the strongest script of the three and the most memorable performances. The true gem is Bill Nighy, whose steely, blue-eyed performance never wavers in the role of a ruthless warlord who would sacrifice anything to maintain power. He might make light of his \\"hissing\\" scenes in recent interviews, but it fantastic on-screen. Whatever you think of the franchise in general, you have to admit that overall it's just plain cool.
B004FHCH9Q|4.0|I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing, irritating, bothersome, etc.  I don't get it.  It's easy, just click on \\"Work\\" and it goes, there are other things you can do leading to other screens and more, which I think makes it a far more interesting \\"play me screen\\" than the standard stuff. The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's \\"The Information\\" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the \\"backward-drawkcab\\" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end.  More of a psychological movie with a little action now and then.  It's not exactly breaking new ground, so I give it four out of five stars.  But it is, as my title indicates, a Fun movie.
0800141601|4.0|The story of King Arthur and his beautiful Lady Guinevere is the stuff legends are made of. This pair of lovers and the knight who managed to come between them have long been speculation for storytelling... but rarely does a film show them as honorable and likable icons. First Knight dares to do as much, proving displeasing to many lovers of the original legend.<br /><br />It is a time of tribulation and warfare in England when one must live by the sword or die by it. Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), Arthur's former First Knight and head of the Round Table, has betrayed his honor and left to follow his own destiny. His lands border the estate of Leanesse, governed over by the beautiful Lady Guinevere (Julia Ormond), but his true quarry is Camelot. Burning, pillaging, and murdering at will, Malagant inflicts terror upon the peasantry who turn to their lady for help... but there is little she can do without accepting an alliance with Camelot. Torn between her freedom and a love for her people, she decides that the best manner in which to protect her tenants is to accept the offer of marriage by King Arthur of Camelot. But while on her journey to the golden city, Guinevere's caravan is attacked by Malagant's men. Arthur's knights are slaughtered and herself, along with her handmaidens, taken prisoner.<br /><br />In a daring escape and only after aiding her ladies to safety, Guinevere flees into the wood and is rescued by the wandering swordsman Lancelot (Richard Gere). A magnificent and fearless fighter but also a notorious womanizer, he attempts to seduce her but she refuses his advances and goes into the welcoming arms of King Arthur (Sean Connery), expecting never to see Lancelot again. However, an ill wind blows no good and Lancelot arrives in Camelot the day of her public engagement. Braving the gauntlet to win a kiss from the would-be queen, Lancelot is praised by Arthur for bravery (and stupidity); admiring the man's courage, the king invites him to join the Knightsof the Round Table in Malagant's place. Their arch-enemy in the meantime is determined to have Leanesse and will stop at nothing to seize control of her kingdom. And when a challenge upon Camelot herself leaves Guinevere in enemy hands, Arthur may loose everything to save her.<br /><br />The love affair that brought an end to Camelot has been speculation for generations. This story covers the basics, ignores the myths surrounding Arthur, and turns him into a true living breathing person of integrity, honor, and Christian compassion. Never has the story been so poignantly realistic, or the characters so memorable. I strayed away from this film when it premiered in the early 1990's because a film about the fated love affair that sent Camelot into ruin was bound to be adulterous. When I did hesitantly give the film a chance, I was immediately impressed with the restraint showed by the producers and scriptwriters. The love affair was merely a sideline to a wonderful story of bravery, honor, and self-sacrifice. What's more, Guinevere was faithful to Arthur save in one instance upon Lancelot's departure, when she gave him a farewell kiss. King Arthur is portrayed as devout, asking for God's mercy and wisdom in dealing with Malagant, his knights, and even Guinevere. \\"I take the good with the bad,\\" he says to Lancelot early on. \\"I can't love people in slices.\\" What a praiseworthy ambition! Yet he doesn't hesitate to punish sin where it's due. Christianity is cast in a respectable light; there is no Merlin, magic, or witchcraft here.<br /><br />Gorgeous scenery, compelling dialogue, magnificent costumes and the sheer magnitude of the Camelot that lives on in myth draws together a film that, despite its very few flaws, will touch your heart. The most moral and compelling Camelot story of all time, First Knight is a film that teaches good ideals and the value of honor. An afternoon well-spent for lovers of the Arthurian legend.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm enjoying this game. Although It's been difficult to make the population happy, it's a good way to burn a bit of time.
B001LF347E|3.0|British television series can be hit or miss with American audiences but some of them become immensely popular and a decision was made to test out programming on the general public on a non-cable network to see if the latest family fare from England would stick. Merlin takes all the legends of the knights of the round table and turns them on their head but for the most part is solid entertainment and certainly better than some of the alternatives. It's also less campy than its precursor, Robin Hood.<br /><br />Magic has been outlawed in the kingdom of Camelot due to \\"grave offenses\\" by wizards and warlocks and so anyone with extraordinary gifts must remain hidden for fear of persecution and death. Young sorcerer Merlin (Colin Morgan) has come to Camelot at the insistence of his mother, who believes he will have a better life outside their impoverished village, but has difficulty not revealing his telekinetic abilities when faced with the bullies of the city, among them the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James). Immediately getting off on the wrong foot with the heir to the throne does him no favors when the king's physician (and a former user of magic) Gaius (Richard Wilson) agrees to mentor him in the hope of further training his abilities. But his unique talent might be revealed when a resentful sorceress visits Camelot intending to have revenge for her mother's death.<br /><br />While learning much from the old dragon that imprisoned beneath the castle until the \\"old ways\\" are reinstated, Merlin hones his skills, attempts to be a good valet to the noble Arthur, and is of interest to the two women in his life -- the hard-working servant girl Guinevere (Angel Coulby) and her mistress, the secretive and beautiful Morgana (McGrath). Woven throughout the first season are encounters with other characters that will become important in Arthur lore -- including a visit from a young peasant who wishes to become a knight (Lancelot), and a child with abnormal magical abilities (Mordred). I was not too impressed with the first couple of episodes. I didn't like their casting decisions all that much and thought Arthur was depicted as too much of a jerk, but after awhile he calmed down and made leaps toward becoming the noble majesty we know so well from various films and legends.<br /><br />The cast are all very good but I do question their judgment in certain areas. The actress playing Gwen is likable enough but she doesn't seem to live up to the reputation Guinevere has of being the most beautiful woman in the kingdom... not to mention the fact that she is a servant. I'm not sure I like how much the legends have been changed to modernize and rejuvenate the material but on the flip side, Morgana is a stroke of brilliance. She is much under-used in the first half of the season but really comes into her own as the series continues and by the end is one of the most interesting characters. The costuming is not accurate but is so gorgeous and unique in kind of a \\"punk medieval\\" style that I don't mind. Certain of Morgana's gowns in particular are exquisite. My only real complaint is that the CGI leaves much to be desired and shows a limited budget, but since it is infrequent that fault can be overlooked.<br /><br />It might not be everyone's cup of tea and is aimed at a younger age group, but the writing is decent enough and the cast good enough that it is easy to sit back and enjoy it as something you will not have to fast-forward your way through. If you can stomach some changes to the legend in favor of a new approach, I think you will enjoy Merlin.

B006PTL1GC|3.0|Following the progression of thought in the minds of three psychologists in the Edwardian era, A Dangerous Method is an intriguing film about not entirely likable individuals that raises some interesting thoughts on morality and repression.<br /><br />No one quite knows what to do with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley). Her keen mind has been overcome with sporadic fits and hallucinations, which lands her in the mental hospital where Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is employed. She proves a fascinating subject, and one that prompts him to consult well-known psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortenson) for his opinion. Over the years, as Sabina improves under sexual therapy, Jung finds his idealistic views of morality challenged through another associate, who believes that monogamy is unnatural and nothing should ever be repressed. But his eventual relationship with Sabina will do more than threaten his reputation... it will also begin to dismantle his precarious relationship with Freud.<br /><br />This is a fascinating movie on many levels, as it explores the hypocritical nature of humankind and at times impresses us with its psychological conclusions and at others makes us smile a bit in their far-reaching explanations. The obsession that Jung has with dreams reveals a lot about his inner motivations and fears, but quite early on we understand that while common interests bring them together, elements of pride will keep Jung and Freud apart. Jung is offended to be the mentored, and Freud cannot confide in them, leaving an unequal friendship certain to implode. In the midst of this sits Sabina, who when we first meet her is contorting her face inside a carriage and then much later, becomes a successful psychologist in the field.<br /><br />Casting on this is utterly delightful. Keira in particular turns in an exquisite performance that requires a large amount of physical manipulation. It is both fascinating and painful for an audience to watch, as a woman struggleswith expressing her internal emotions. Fassbender is an adequate Jung, and if his intention was to make me dislike the man, he did it perfectly. It's unusual to enter a movie about Jung and come out liking Freud more, but that is what happened. Viggo is brilliant in the role, vanishing into it so completely that at times I forgot he was acting. You can see the richness of the Edwardian period in the lush costumes and settings, some of which are particularly exquisite. It also has a beautiful musical score and real intelligence in its screenplay.<br /><br />I did not see most of the harsher content, but the film does earn its R-rating for sexual material and nudity. I was left to enjoy the richness of the production and the intellectual scope of the script, one that combines social prejudices and our desire to know what alters our behavior, but also the emptiness of Jung's life.

B0011NVC98|3.0|Beowulf is the oldest known legend in the English language, adapted from a series of what we can only presume was the Norse mythology of the hero that inspired such figures as King Arthur. The original poem is somewhat tedious and disjointed, and this recent film is only partially like it, filling in the story and making some major changes in order to promote it toward modern audiences.<br /><br />The kingdom belonging to King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is being terrorized by a violent half-demon by the name of Grendel (Crispin Glover), whose sensitivity to noise makes him particularly wrathful against the shouting and carrying on that transpires in the local mead house. Leaving devastation and rampant bodies in his wake, he threatens the lives and livelihoods of all, and Hrothgar desires to find a man capable of defeating him. His hero comes in the form of Beowulf (Ray Winstone), known for his acts of astounding courage and the defeat of numerous sea monsters and other devils of the northern world. Respected by his men and feared by his enemies, it does not take him long to cast his eye on Hrothgar's beautiful but emotionally distant wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).<br /><br />In a climactic battle that leaves carnage rampant in its wake, Beowulf wounds Grendel enough that he is forced to crawl back into his cave and perish in the arms of his mother, a water demon (Angelina Jolie). Her rage is absolute and only hours after Beowulf has been claimed as a hero, honored by the people and given the gift of a magnificent golden horn, she returns to extract vengeance for her son's murder, leaving him no choice but to hunt her down and defeat her as well. But once in her cave of wonders, Beowulf comes to discover that the lure of absolute can be stronger than anything he has before encountered.<br /><br />When I first saw images from the film, I wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me, because it was not immediately apparent that this was a live-action animated feature. This may be a trend that takes off in future years, since computer technology has come so far that they are now capable of making realistic human images, and in that sense Beowulf is an absolute masterpiece. There are moments when the computer animation is not fully rendered (the horses look the most fake, but all of the humans, dragons, and other CGI creatures are absolutely astounding) but most of it left me with my mouth open, because visually it is magnificent. Sometimes the characters look almost human, their facial expressions are so real. Other reviewers have remarked that it's impossible for a cold 3D image to convey true emotion, and to a degree, this is true, but Beowulf is not meant to invoke any magnificent response in its audience other than excitement, so it's ultimately forgivable.<br /><br />The film I rented was the director's cut, which I have since learned does not differ much from the theatrical release other than in terms of blood spatter. It was fun -- and it looks incredible in HD.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|Picking up immediately where the first season left off, the second installment in the Legend of the Seeker series is an action packed adventure that pits our favorite sword-wielding hero against a far more formidable enemy than he might have ever imagined.<br /><br />Freedom has come to the Midlands with the death of its tyrannical leader, the sorcerer Darken Rahl, at the hands of the Seeker, a young man prophesied to defeat great evil wherever he finds it. But in using an ancient and powerful magic to bring about his adversary's death, Richard (Craig Horner) has accidentally torn a rift in the barrier between the Midlands and the Underworld. The ruler of the Underworld is a vicious harbinger of death determined to conquer the world of the living. Known only as the Keeper, he uses the tear in the rift to send forth hellish minions to prey on the souls of the living. The invincible immortal beings begin a trail of slaughter that Richard must find some way to halt, little realizing the Keeper has another follower willing to do his bidding -- the spirit of Darken Rahl (Craig Parker) is to act as an intermediary between the Keeper and Seeker.<br /><br />When the Mord'Sith storm a neighboring village and kidnap seven little girls they intend to \\"train\\" to join their order, Cara (Tabrett Bethall) and the Mother Confessor, Kahlan (Bridget Regan), must unite to rescue the children. But worse perils and revealed secrets lie ahead that will threaten their lives and test the boundaries of friendship. Richard's grandfather and wizard Zedd (Bruce Spence) has learned of another prophecy that claims Richard will widen the rift and allow the Keeper out of the Underworld. Soon, the Seeker might become his own greatest enemy in the battle between good and evil.<br /><br />This series fills the fantasy void while being exceptionally well written and entertaining. Loosely based on a book series but much more streamlined, the episodes are more formidable this season. The villain is infinitely more powerful, the romance is kicked up a notch, and there are new characters thrown into the mix, but that doesn't mean it has lost its charm. Fans worried the introduction of Mord'Sith might throw off the balance but instead it breathes new life into the group. Cara is on a journey of self-discovery, cold and unfeeling at first but progressively more selfless and compassionate (to a certain extent) as the show continues. There is a fantastic cast of guest characters that range from the return of Darken Rahl in human form to a visit from what appears to be the Creator. There are reanimated corpses (mummies and zombies), time reversals, split personalities, courtroom trials, and trips to the underworld. It's all-around a much more creative and intense season and an improvement if possible on the first. It provides our opportunity to meet Kahlan's father, learn the truth of Darken Rahl's existence, encounter Zedd as a young man, meet the last of the Confessors, encounter new sorceresses, and much more. Craig Parker is even given a chance to show a comedic side in playing a Darken Rahl look-alike. The acting really is tremendous this time around, particularly from Regan when she is asked to play the two sides of Kahlan -- one a cold Mother Confessor and the other a lovesick sap.<br /><br />I loved seeing the characters develop. It was fun watching Cara and Kahlan start out as enemies and become friends, as well as Richard learning more about his past and parentage and even exploring a bit of Zedd's youth. There are a lot of episodes that are just plain fun to watch -- the comedy is ever-present in spite of some serious themes and the season ends on a high note after putting us through thrills, chills, and an anticipated amount of romance.

The don't fall out, the band that fits around my head is very comfortable, I don't even notice that they are touching my head, they are that light.  Well worth the money. The sound, now this is what really sold me...the sound is; very good; stereo, full, bright, plenty of bass, not what I expected out of something so small.  There doesn't appear to be a driver, which I love in my UE earbuds, at $200 though.  I don't think you will be disappointed in these, and at such a low price you can't go wrong.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|There is a natural human curiosity toward death. Christians have nothing to fear, but most of the rest of the world is concerned with what lies beyond death. Perhaps this is why so many centuries ago, the notion of vampires were created, a creature able to cheat death and remain immortal, but at often a terrible price. Legends of vampires date back to ancient Rome, but modern depictions are somewhat more interesting. Underworld: Evolution is the second installment in a film series about a Death Dealer and her battle against Lycans, or werewolves.<br /><br />In the early ages of time, two sons were born to the mighty warrior Alexander. One was bitten by wolf, the other by bat, and from them came two opposing races. Lycans are incapable of channeling their rage, remaining in werewolf form indefinitely, engaging in the slaughter of innocents. In order to prevent his brother from wiping out the human race, Marcus (Tony Curran) enlists the assistance of the treacherous Viktor (Bill Nighy) to halt him. Rather than relinquish the captured werewolf into Marcus' keeping, Viktor has him locked away for centuries. Thousands of years later, Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) hopes to reawaken Marcus in order to stop the evil traitor Kraven (Shane Brolly) from ruling the vampire coven. Responsible for Viktor's death and marked as an enemy of her race, Selene's only companion is Michael (Scott Speedman), the half-vampire, half-Lycan hybrid.<br /><br />So much death and destruction among the vampires has commanded the attention of Corvinus (Derek Jacobi), who has a profound interest in both races. His concerns are furthered when Marcus awakens and destroys the coven. The ancient vampire now seeks Selene, which ultimately leads them to torturous discoveries surrounding the death of her family centuries earlier, and engages all those who remain in a battle for ultimate power. The story picks up where the original left off but gives viewers reminders through flashbacks to help speed the process along. It is ultimately more complex this time around and has better emotional impact. Audiences will be wowed with the combination of high sci-fi action and cool gadgets. I very much enjoy Derek Jacobi's acting and it was a joy to see him in this production. There's just something too cool about his domineering and mysterious presence, and he plays well off Kate Beckinsale in their too-few scenes together. I also appreciated that they brought back Amelia, a vampire queen from the first film.<br /><br />There are so many questions left unanswered that the film series could go on indefinitely with careful planning. It was well filmed, beautifully scored, and had some fantastic action sequences. I loved the new character of Corvinus and enjoyed the fast-paced nature of the storytelling. If they intend to film further adventures in the series, their rapt audience awaits, because we cannot get enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've heard about The Hunger Games over the last few years and resisted reading it for two reasons.  First, I hate depressing books.  I mean, they depress me for days, so generally I avoid this.  (This is the reason I'm not in my mother's book club.lol) Given the premise of the book I couldn't see ho it could be anything but totally depressing.  Second,  I was sure it could not live up to the hype.  So many people were waiting anxiously for the third book and talking about how good it was, I was sure that would be sorely disappointed when I finally setteled down to ready. I finally decided to read it because of the movie release.  Wanting to see the movie but knowing films never do complete justice to the written word, I decided I had to read it first.<br /><br />Thankfully, all of my resons for resistance were completely wrong.  This book lived of to the hype, and then some.  While there were moments that almost had me in tears, the story was so fast paced that you as a reader couldn't wallow but had to keep up with Katniss.<br /><br />The character development is amazing. Katniss was such a complex character, but you as a reader never have a hard time reconciling her complexity. To me that is the work of a wonderful author.  Katniss is smart, resourceful, caring, pragmatic,hopeful and practical. She manages as a survivor not to worry about things down the road, but focuses on the moment, while keeping the bigger picture in mind.  And all of the characters surrounding Katniss help to give us the full picture of the girl. In fact, all of the characters in this book are multi-dimensional.<br /><br />Ms. Collins has created a 3-D futuristic world that any reader would love to dive into.  I can only hope that the movie does a good job of recreating it.<br /><br />Stats:<br />Ebook pages: 267<br />Genre: YA, Action Adventure<br />Re-Readability (1=Low;5=High): 5
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Legend of the Seeker is based on the Sword of Truth book series by Terry Goodkind. Fans of the series may or may not love the television adaptation but for a newcomer like me, it was twenty-two hours of solid entertainment, unique plot twists, and fantastic character development. If you are into this genre you will love this series.<br /><br />Two horses cross the woodlands, their female riders low over their necks as they are pursued by a half-dozen soldiers. One of them is struck in the back by an arrow and plunges down an incline, her sister scrambling after her. Tear stricken, Kahlan (Bridget Regan) is forced to grasp the book her sister hands her and flee toward the magical boundary that separates the Midlands from D'Hara. Using the light of a night wisp to penetrate the barrier and pass through it, Kahlan is chased into the woods by several men on foot. There, she encounters young Richard Cypher (Craig Horner). He comes to her defense and is astonished that she seems to possess unusual magical powers. Threatening to harm him if he follows her, Kahlan goes in search of a great wizard known to be in the far lands by the name of Zeddicus (Bruce Spence).<br /><br />Recounting his adventure to his father and complaining of a bite from a venomous magical plant he has never seen before, Richard is astonished when his father tells him to go to Zeddicus at once -- \\"He will explain everything,\\" he says, before shoving him out the side door. Suffering greatly and nearly perishing from the fatal bite, Zed heals him through magic and informs an astonished Kahlan that this is the man she is searching for. Kahlan is a member of an ancient order known as Confessors, whose primary role in life is to defend, protect, and guide the Seeker. Born every century or so, the Seeker is destined to take up the sword of truth and defeat evil with it. The greatest evil in the midlands is Darken Rahl (Craig Parker), who was foretold of the Seeker's birth and attempted to kill him at infancy by wiping out all the children of his village. Richard at first does not want to accept his destiny but when the soldiers kill his father, knows someone must defend the innocent.<br /><br />Throughout the first season Richard comes to terms with his newfound gifts and abilities, protects those in need of assistance, and comes ever nearer to doing battle with his enemy. Zed accompanies him as a teacher and Kahlan becomes more than a friend -- but their love cannot be consummated without the possibility of Richard losing his soul. You can tell this is based on a book series because the plot twists and scripts are too good to be otherwise. The character development has been carefully planned and seeds of information are planted all along the way that contribute to the viewer feeling as if they know a lot about all the characters. I loved the glimpses into the different pasts of the characters, all of whom are fascinating and complex. The acting is tremendous and the costume design and scenery gorgeous. The series was filmed in New Zealand and it looks like another world -- surreal and distant from civilization. There was not a single weak actor or actress involved, and the finale is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />While the author has been criticized for his heavy-handed violence and other inappropriate themes in the books, it has been significantly toned down for the series. Still, some of the underlining symbolism and messages remain. Richard is a very noble hero willing to fight against evil and do what is right regardless of the personal consequences. He goes out of his way to help even people who have betrayed him and stands as a symbol of hope in the Midlands. His iconic birth reflects ancient and religious history -- a baby foretold to defeat a great evil. Moral themes bleed through, along with messages about good and evil, honesty, and sacrifice. Legend of the Seeker is a moving and magical journey that I wanted never to end.
1594744769|5.0|I failed to read the description of the book, only buying it based upon the unique cover and title. It was book five out of my eight books I bought for spring break reading, and is by far the best one I've read. I wasn't expecting it to be a great book, as I often pick random books and they either enrapture me or disappoint me. I was quite enraptured with this book. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a poignant, peculiar tale. I highly recommend the read, especially for those who like a blend of a vintage setting, bildungsroman, and a little bit of \\"fantasy.\\" I didn't mind reading it on a Kindle format, as I have good eyes. Others who have complained about the Kindle version may, perhaps, be rather lazy or strain their eyes to distinguish things.<br /> The book reminds me of a read that would appeal to fans of such books as A Great and Terrible Beauty. Regardless, it's a great book and I'm forcing all of my friends to read it. I think there could easily be a sequel, but that's too much to hope for, and could end up being a disappointing end. Miss Peregrine's may be best left alone. [[ASIN:B004FGMDOQ Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]
B004QOB8SO|3.0|I love these modern interpretations of the classic character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1880's. This is the same Sherlock Holmes that stalked those foggy London streets, albeit a bit ruder, but now he has a cell phone!<br /><br />Leave it to a madman to give up far too easily. When last we saw Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch), he was a bit tied up with Moriarty waiting for a bomb to go off in his face, but one phone call and his arch-nemesis calls the whole thing off, since he has better things to do. Sherlock returns to his flat with his best friend John Watson (Martin Freeman) and proceeds to be bored... with a lot of things. With his newfound popularity, with the fact that John's blog is a big hit, with the photographers following him around, and the lackluster cases brought to him concerning missing ashes and dead grandfathers and so forth. He wants something better, something to capture his interest... and he's about to get it.<br /><br />One morning bright and early, Sherlock is plucked from the flat and taken to Buckingham Palace for a little chat with his elder brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). It seems that a professional dominatrix named Irene Adler has some photographs of a member of the royal family that they would really rather not got out to the press. One would assume it was for purpose of blackmail, but other than informing them of the incriminating images, Irene has not asked for anything else. This peaks his interest and alleviates his boredom and somewhat reluctantly he agrees to investigate and manipulate her out of the contents of her phone, little realizing that Irene intends to be one step ahead of him the entire way.<br /><br />Where through subsequent viewings of this episode, I managed to untangle my initial horrified reaction from my ability to be impartial, I must say that my first time through the season premiere was a bit... uncomfortable. Not only has series creator and head writer Steven Moffat taken one of the more remarkable women in Doyle's stories and regressed her feminism and intelligence back a couple of centuries, he has also made that first hour and a half a bit rough going if you plan on having your family in the room. Irene is a bisexual dominatrix that spends an entire scene in the buff (the camera is careful, but we still get an eyefull).<br /><br />My feelings about this season are varied. It has some truly wonderful moments but I'm a bit torn by the Irene Adler fiasco. Moffat, who is usually known for his tight plots, goes out on a limb with a complicated and confusing episode that is not quite up to par with the second episode, in which Mark Gatiss modernizes the most famous of all Holmes mysteries, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Now that is a brilliant hour and a half of television, with enough references to the original to please fans but an independent conclusion all its own, so do not anticipate things turning out the same way after all.<br /><br />The third episode is also the most emotional and if you have not read the original stories, you may want to prepare for a horrific twist toward the end. I'm not quite certain where as a fan I stand on their interpretation of Moriarty as a pure madman but I must say that among other things (such as not having Watson be a dolt, as many adaptations fumble in that area) their interpretation of Mycroft Holmes is inspired. He has the right amount of sheer humanity and genius, a touch of arrogance and insult that makes him identifiable as a Holmes but a bit more distance than his brother. Each of the three episodes has its allure in clever writing and memorable moments, throwing in humorous antics as well as more serious and life-threatening situations. I'm a bit sorry that the premiere had so many issues in it because near-nudity aside, it's actually an intriguing installment. Many viewers may find the constant references to homosexuality tiring as I do, but overall Sherlock is still one of the finest things on television and at the end of its short season, leaves us wanting more.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|For a long time now, Captain America has been my favorite Marvel comics character. He's just awesome. He's been a little on the dark side, particularly during the 80's, when it was required that EVERY superhero comic went through a dark phase, and with some of the recent Brubaker era work, Steve Rogers has seen some serious stuff go down. What Joe Johnston did with this film, and how it not only differentiates itself from all of the other Marvel films (not just the Marvel Studios films, but all films based on Marvel characters), but also how well it works, is how unapologetically sincere and earnest it is.<br /><br />Without exception, all of the other Marvel-based films have had their fill of post-modern cynicism and self-referential humor, and I'm not really knocking it. For the most part, it's suited the films well, particularly X2 and SPIDER-MAN 2. But this is a film set in the 1940's, and it's about a young man who believes so much in the ideals of his country and who so badly wants to make a difference, he's willing to put his own life on the line to potentially change it.<br /><br />Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss \\"God\\" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either. There is great fun to be had with this film, and you gotta love the little RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK references in it. Also the cast in and of itself is quite good, particularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine. I honestly get choked up in the scene Erskine and Rogers share in the barracks the night before the experiment. It's my favorite scene of the film, because it gives you time to connect with the characters on an emotional level without any flash or gimmicks. This is pretty easily my favorite of the Marvel Studios films thus far...ticularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine.

B002BWP49C|3.0|Reviewing a Twilight movie is rather subjective because it is a simple fact that fans are going to love it no matter what and no one else cares. That being said, I liked this film about as much as I liked the book.<br /><br />The time has come for Bella (Kristen Stewart) to give up her humanity and become the vampire wife of Edward (Robert Pattinson). Pre-wedding jitters combined with the absence and noticeable disapproval of her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) cast a slight shadow over the day, which unfolds just as her future sister in law Alice has planned -- beautifully, even though her father Charlie is a tad disgruntled at her marriage at eighteen, her mother has had a little too much to drink, and her friends suspect she must be pregnant to be tying the knot so young. But it isn't long before the couple is pronounced man and wife and find themselves on a gorgeous island for their honeymoon -- one Bella insists on spending as a human, much to the consternation of anyone who knows. Their passionate night of lovemaking leaves her a little bruised and her husband too intimidated that he might hurt her again to revisit the experience, but Bella manages to convince him to give it another try and the next day wakes up feeling a little bit odd.<br /><br />Within hours, she is convinced that she might be pregnant -- but is such a thing even possible? Apparently it is, and the debate over whether or not to let the \\"demon spawn\\" live in spite of its seeming intent to kill her from the inside out overshadows all that follows -- which I must admit, is not enough to make a dull book into a four-hour two part film. It's a given that this movie is only for the diehard fans, because for anyone else it will feel melodramatic and slow, without much going for its second half. The first twenty minutes are great (albeit, drug out with internal anxiety over marriage and the wedding night) but once Bella starts bloating like a balloon while simultaneously becoming emaciated, the filmfollows the same trend that plagued the book -- it abandons all former consistency within the series, all the fun and humor and romance, and turns into a B-grade horror plot. There simply is not enough plot to keep any sort of momentum going and the actors are not solid enough to let it stand purely on emotion alone. Granted, it is not all bad, there are some nice moments here of decent characterization and the acting is much better than when this gang first hit the big screen. There's even a lovely short scene midway through the closing credits with the Italian vampires that are going to present problems in part two. The cinematography is lovely and I particularly enjoyed some of the sweeter moments between Edward and Bella on their Honeymoon.<br /><br />Opinions are going to be varied when it comes to this movie -- if you are a die-hard fan of the book, you will enjoy it, because it is faithful to the source material (though certain compelling things, such as Edward's doubt about his ability to be a parent, are omitted). If, like me, you did not care for the book, there is a very good chance you will have the same feelings about the film. I enjoyed the first half hour but as it progressed felt the same annoyance and frustration that I did in reading the book and realizing it was not what I wanted it to be or how I hoped Bella and Edward's story would end. Granted, the filmmakers have a hard task ahead of them in adapting a book that was extremely violent and just plain weird to the big screen -- and they have done a nice job, even if it feels (to me, at least) that turning it into two films was a bit pretentious given the limited subject material. In remaining sincere to the source material and exploring the nuances of Bella's trepidation about marriage, they have done well.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I can remember as a kid watching THE MUPPET SHOW with my family, and we all liked it for various reasons, but no matter the age difference, we all laughed and loved the creations of the dear departed Jim Henson and Frank Oz. During the late 70's and into the early 80's, The Muppets were heavily ingrained in pop culture, with the show and with the feature films THE MUPPET MOVIE, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN, where Oz made his directing debut. But in the years following, something happened. The further away from the lovable characters we were, the less we thought of them. After a few attempts to bring the Muppets to the big screen again after the passing of Jim Henson, with films like A MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, nothing really became of them. The Muppets went from being universally beloved to \\"Out of sight; out of mind\\" in just one generation.<br /><br />But leave it to the creative minds of co-writer/co-star Jason Segel, and THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS Bret McKenzie and director James Bobit to not only reintroduce The Muppets to a whole new generation, but to also remind those of us who had forgotten the great wonder and joy that we experienced watching The Muppets. Like some of the greatest of the Disney/Pixar films, they transplant the ideology of that company which is to always aim for the smartest person in the audience and allow the rest to be taken in by the joy of the spectacle.<br /><br />But in their genius, Bobit, Segel and McKenzie actually engage us with these characters again, but not with a reboot or a reimagining or a sequel. They actually recognize, as does the film itself, that The Muppets haven't been a thing for quite some time, and their efforts to save their studio from demolishing by the diabolical villain of the piece, oil baron Tex Richman (played with tongue firmly planted in cheek by Chris Cooper) are shot down at nearly every turn by television executives who find they can get more mileage out of lowest-denomiator abusive reality TV than a program that is intelligent and charming (the film works on several levels; one of them being biting satire). As a writer, Segel sells his humor well, as well as the director Bobit, who directs the film with great verve and smarts. The songs by McKenzie are outrageous (the Oscar-Winning \\"Man or Muppet\\"), infectious (\\"Life's a Happy Song\\"), and surprisingly poignant (\\"Pictures in My Head\\"). Also working her many charms here is Amy Adams, the perfect girl-next-door schoolteacher who can also fix a V-12 engine and is Segel's character's girlfriend of 10 years.<br /><br />Also along side the many fuzzy characters (obvious returns by Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rolf, Animal, Beaker, and the indomitable Miss Piggy among many many others) is the new character of Walter, Segel's younger brother, who, along with Segel, finds his destiny with the help of The Muppets.<br /><br />What could literally be the most telling moment of the whole film is as members of the Muppet cast sing an abridged and incredibly amusing version of Nirvana's eponymous classic, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in the presence of an angry Jack Black, calling them out as ruining one of the greatest songs of all time. This would probably be lost on most audience members the first time around, but when I rewatched it again just a few days ago, I saw there was something more going on. The song itself is considered the ultimate song of teen angst and volatile cynicism, but the way that the song is performed is outrageous, filled with lively humor and vacant of the vitriol of the original song. This is essentially the message of the film, and I'm paraphrasing Joss Whedon here: \\"The ultimate expression of defiance is joy.\\" The film basically tells us all to deny what the societal norms are of cynicism, derision and snark and embrace the things that give us the greatest happiness; the things that are free of all of what our culture has become. For this reason above all, THE MUPPETS is a film for the ages, young and old.HE MUPPETS is a film for the ages, young and old.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|There's nothing I love more than a big-budget blockbuster. I did not go in expecting much and when I came out, had decided Prince of Persia is worthy of the legacy Disney's last epic-scale franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean, left behind.<br /><br />Orphaned and left to fend for himself, young Dastan never realized when he risked his life for another child that he would draw the attention of royalty, but when King Sharaman witnesses the boy's courage and fortitude, it is decided that Dastan will be raised as his own along with his sons. Fifteen years later, the royal princes are formidable in warfare and fond of one another. The eldest (Richard Coyle) is in training to become the future king of Persia, while his dutiful uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) guides his responses and assists him in making wise decisions. When it becomes known that one of their holy cities is supplying their enemies with weapons, it is decided that the city must be taken by force -- a feat that proves successful but not without cost. In defeating an adversary, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) comes into possession of a fine dagger with a glass hilt. What he does not realize is this special dagger will give him the power to turn back time... and that it is worth killing for.<br /><br />One of the guardians of the magical dagger is Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), who becomes a fugitive along with Dastan when something unthinkable happens. Soon they are running from their lives with a ransom on their heads -- and the full force of the dagger has yet to be revealed. While this script is inspired by a popular video game, and the movie does play homage to the game in various fun and smart ways, it can stand alone as a decent piece of cinematic material. Most adaptations cannot claim that much -- this has a first-rate plot, some fun twists and turns, and enough adventure to satisfy even the most ADD audience. I can count on one hand the number of times an audience has applauded at the end of a film, and thisis one of them. It's a romantic, dangerous, mystical adventure into a fantasy version of history, complete with gorgeous costumes and a solid cast. Gyllenhaal and Arterton have great chemistry and their romance does not feel rushed or forced, since it starts off on the wrong foot, continues into constant arguments, and then at the end begins to soften.<br /><br />Many of the escape methods and fighting techniques are straight out of the game -- leaping rooftops, sliding around on ropes, dangling from wooden pegs halfway up sheer walls, climbing with the assistance of arrows embedded into stone. There are a few modern jokes thrown in for the audience's enjoyment (one man Dastan runs into evades Persian taxes by spreading lies about the notorious thieves in a particular valley, whereas there is nothing more terrifying than ostrich races going on) and problematic material is kept to a minimum. If you're fond of the fantasy genre or were not concerned with the supernatural aspect in the Pirates films, this is no more pervasive and in some ways, less sinister since it doesn't involve the walking dead. It surprised me with the fact that it was simply fun to watch -- it doesn't require much emotional involvement but still manages to include a few wonderful moments and they were careful to keep the action scenes from becoming too repetitive. Overall, it's one of the more enjoyable experiences I have had in the cinema.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app and it works great on Kindle Fire! I love to shop ebay! No problems whatsoever! THANKS!! APP ROCKS!!!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|Life isn't easy when you are so weighted down with bulging muscles and sheer enthusiasm that it's hard to find your place in the world. But it helps when you have vengeance driving you.<br /><br />Even though they are Barbarians, they are not untouchable. That is the hard lesson that young Conan learns when a foreign army invades his village, slaughters the people, and leaves him to die right alongside his father. Up until then he had a decent life. It was hard and full of bloodshed and loss, but his dad was teaching him the finer points of swordsmanship and how to be a decent warrior. But in that moment everything changed. Khalar (Stephen Lang) is after only one thing: the missing pieces to a mythical mask that gives its wearer the power of necromancy. It seems that the local do-gooders killed his sorceress wife and he wants her back again, so she can bring an underworld army with her and make him the most powerful thug on the face of the earth. But in order to activate the mask, he needs the blood of someone from one of the original necromancer bloodlines.<br /><br />Twenty years later, he is still seeking her out, along with his sorceress daughter Marique (Rose McGowen). But Conan (Jason Momoa) has grown up in the meantime with a grudge nearly as big as his muscles. He wants revenge for the death of his father and the destruction of his village. And if he has to kidnap the beautiful Tamara (Rachel Nichols), the last of the ancient bloodline, to do it, he will. This leads to a confrontation of sorcery and necromancy as the two enemies are pitted against one another in a battle that is both personal and otherwise. Overall, the movie isn't awful but it isn't magnificent either. It falls somewhere in the middle, hampered by the frequent gore and absurd departures from rational characterization. (Why would a pure little \\"monk\\" like Tamara get down and dirty for a night with Conan, and then return to her chaste monastery as if nothing had happened? And why would Marique take her on in a closed space and not use magic?) But the music is stirring and the performances are good. It is even a halfway decent plot with good visuals to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />But that's when we get to the real problems here -- for me, maybe as a woman and maybe merely as a viewer, the film dragged in places, particularly when it was just Conan doing battle with sandmen, or a giant octopus-like creature, or simply a bad guy in the dungeons. It picked up the pace whenever Tamara was around but the downside is that in showcasing how cool Conan is, they kind of ignored the much more interesting characters -- like Marique, the stuff of Barbarian nightmares. This film is also simply beautiful to look at, with lush, rich surroundings that range from panoramic daylight to the dank underground. And I loved the costuming; it isn't much to look at for the first half, but when we get into the female priestesses and ceremonial robes, it's gorgeous.<br /><br />Inspired by the earlier film in the same vein, one does not expect epic writing brilliance from Conan the Barbarian. One expects gorgeous women in distress, oiled muscles glinting in the sunlight, blood spraying in all directions, and some good old fashioned sorcery -- and that is pretty much what one gets. There were moments I really enjoyed, moments where I was bored, moments that disgusted me, and moments in which I wished it had simply been better. Because the potential was there, it just got kind of sidetracked in its desire to be a formulaic success.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I really do appreciate the physics and math behind this app, and it is indeed pretty, so I gave it four stars for creativity. But really, this app is entirely useless. Sure, once in a while a cool pattern develops, but that is not nearly enough to sustain my interest or justify its taking up space on my phone. I certainly was not \\"overcome with sense of peace and serenity\\", as it says in the description section for this app. So, it will be uninstalled soon. But it was worth playing around with for a few minutes. I would have given it five stars (and kept it) if it included a live wallpaper. Then it would have had at least some purpose.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Fairy tales have captured our imaginations for generations. This reimagining of a classic fairy tale will appeal to older audiences but I would not recommend it to younger ones.<br /><br />Everything about Valarie (Amanda Seyfried) has always set her apart from the rest of the villagers. Promised in marriage to the respectable Henry (Max Irons), her heart yearns instead for a local woodcutter, Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), who returns her affections and asks her to run away with him into the mountains. Their plans are thwarted when the bell is rung, signifying that a wolf has slain one of the villagers. For over twenty years they have lived in fear, bartering for their lives by sacrificing up their best livestock in exchange for the wolf not entering the village. But now Valarie's sister has been slain, devastating her parents (Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen) and Grandmother (Julie Christie). The men of the community are angry enough to go out and hunt down the beast, led by the resident blacksmith (Michael Shanks), but the village reverend pleads with them to await the arrival of a priest with experience in hunting wolves.<br /><br />Rather than heed his advice, the men take up their swords and torches and go into the wilds. Disaster transpires as a result and confusion, suspicion, and betrayal enter the village at the arrival of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who informs them their legends are a lie. The wolf does not live in the distant mountains but among them, a human with the ability to transform....<br /><br />Adapting a fairy tale for the big screen is tricky and many films have tried it, but few can find that delicate balance between the underlining romanticism and horror of the original. This succeeds, at least in the sense that it is both engaging and interesting. Visually, it is stunning, full of haunting woods and a soft, often warm color scheme (in spite of it being winter). The costuming is striking but never overwhelms the actors, all of whom are adequate and in some instances very good. Oldman in particular seems to be enjoying this role, and Christie is quite ominous as the strange and slightly sinister Grandmother. The romantic triangle is a tad contrived but most of the rest of the script is good, if not intentionally misleading as it takes us in different directions with the intention of obscuring who the werewolf really is. It does a masterful job and while some of the plot twists are predictable, I appreciated that the two young men vying for Valarie's attention avoid most of the usual stereotypes.<br /><br />One cannot recommend this too easily because it does approach a fairy tale with a more mature, sensual outlook and at times the acting is painfully wooden, but I really enjoyed it. From beginning to end it was beautiful to look at and held my attention. It may not be for everyone but if you love fantasy and fairy tales stories as I do, if nothing else it will be a diverting way to spend a couple of hours.
0446672653|5.0|As a recently widowed woman of 51, and losing my neice (who was 25 years young) 14 months later, this book shook me to the core. Let me be HONEST, I am a TRUE Sceptic. Yes, I do believe that our souls continue on....I cannot imagine that when we die, its lights out, and game over...Yet, in saying that...do I believe that our souls relive many lifetimes? I don't KNOW...What I do know, is that this book has shifted my thought process. I am a very fast avid reader. I eat books. What would have been a couple hour read, ended up taking me two weeks to finish. I shed more tears throughout this book, than I have ever cried with any other book. (fiction or not)....<br /><br />I must, in all good faith, regardless if I am or WAS a non-believer, I recommend this book FULLY and whole heartedly.<br />I will only say, as a fair warning, bring tissues. You can literally FEEL your heart crack just a bit.....<br />Thank you Dr Weiss for sharing this journey with us. Its one that will stay with me for a very very long time.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Mythology dates legends of vampires all the way back into ancient Rome, when the goddess Lamia was believed to punish those unfaithful to her by robbing them of their children in the night, and draining their blood. In the centuries since, vampires have both been hated and feared, but in recent times, also featured as empathetic heroes in comic books and film franchises. Underworld is the most successful.<br /><br />A war has been raging for centuries between the lycans (a particular set of werewolves) and Vampires. Among the black-clad vampire warriors known as Death Dealers trained to defeat the enemy is Selene (Kate Beckinsale). Driven by an intense hatred for the werewolves that slaughtered her family in the middle ages, and a desire to please Viktor (Bill Nighy), her mentor and one of the three remaining elders, currently in a century-long hibernation, she relentlessly tracks and slays the enemy one by one. The lycans have taken a recent interest in a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), and the vampires desire to know why. Soon it will be the eve of the Awakening, when the vampires will gather to awaken Marcus, the next chosen elder meant to rule. The current leader of the coven is power driven Kraven (Shane Brolly), who seeks to pursue Selene as his future queen, but is jealously guarded by the equally determined Erika (Sophia Myles).<br /><br />Lucian (Michael Sheen), ruler of the Lyrons, has been rumored to be dead for centuries, slain at Kraven's hand, but Selene becomes convinced he still lives. Michael is forced to be taken into confidence when he is repetitively hunted by werewolves, unraveling a dangerous train of events that lead to slaughter, destruction, betrayal, and torment as the coven is split apart through mistrust and rivalry. What results is an exciting two hours spent delving into the underground and the rivalry between feuding clans. If nothing else, the film is original and exciting. It features strong leading women, as well as memorable male counterparts, which makes it appeal to female audiences. It also doesn't overdo the gore factor, and is light on profane language. There are currently two versions of this film released to the general public. The R-rated edition is twenty minutes shy of the Unrated's full length, but the longer version gives a much more dynamic structure to the subplot involving Kraven and Erika. Because of this, and because the content isn't spiked too much, I am fonder of the longer version.<br /><br />The brilliance on the part of the filmmakers is not the open ending, but the obscure references to the past history of the characters. It could easily fuel a pre-Underworld film series for its cluster of bloodthirsty fans.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Breaking Dawn in Blue Ray is an excellent experience! The scenery is wonderful as is.. but, the dimensions add even more mystery and romance to the story.<br />The Twilight series is for all romantics!

B004LROMSO|2.0|I have never really found a version of the King Arthur legend that I preferred to any other. I had semi high hopes for this series but it never quite worked for me.<br /><br />Banished in the wake of her father's marriage to a new queen, Morgan le Fay (Eva Green) is determined to reclaim the throne. Hoping her father will take her back after their estrangement, she gives him one last chance to redeem his previous bad behavior and return her to the line of his succession. At his adamant refusal, she brings about his death and casts his wife, Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani), from the castle. With the kingdom at peril and concerns high over whether or not a woman can lead, she knows her first responsibility must be to form an alliance with her father's mortal enemy, Lord Lot (James Purefoy). Intrigued at her proposition that they rule side by side, he agrees to help her defend Camelot against potential usurpers, not realizing there is another claimant to the throne.<br /><br />Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower) has no knowledge of his royal ancestry and lives a simple life in the country, constantly teasing his elder brother by stealing all the best women right out from under his nose and pleasantly troubled by dreams of a beautiful woman (Tamsin Egerton). Then a mysterious and slightly sinister man appears on the doorstep of the family hovel and informs him that he is the illegitimate heir of King Uthur. Since the day he helped bring Arthur into the world, Merlin (Joseph Fienness) has not touched magic again. But he will need to learn to master it if it he is to defeat Morgan, assist Arthur in climbing a mountain to draw the sword from the stone, and make certain Camelot rises again...<br /><br />This cable station has a history of putting controversial content ahead of scripting and while Camelot does suffer from being pointlessly gratuitous, the script is surprisingly solid and the characters are interesting, Merlin most of all as we attempt to discern his motivations andunderstand his reservations about magic. Fiennes has an excellent grasp on him that makes him likable but also a little sinister and his scenes are among the finest, but it is Eva Green who wins the day with her empathetic but dark Morgan. I know she's supposed to be the villain but I liked her, far more than I probably should. The real problem here is Arthur. I had  hard time liking him and when you're actually rooting for his sister to take the kingdom that shows something is wrong. The writing struggles from being a tad formulaic at times but there are some excellent twists and turns, as well as unusual takes on various legends. (How Merlin comes by Excalibur is chilling and haunting both, as well as their approach to the Lady of the Lake.) The costuming is adequate and imaginative and the setting and backdrop breathtaking (it was filmed in Ireland).<br /><br />In some regards this series is quite good and in others it fails miserably, mostly because a lot of people dislike the actor who plays Arthur. I never minded him so much as I disliked the figure of Arthur -- he is something of a hypocrite and completely selfish, but does gradually begin to mature as the series unfolds. The manner in which the audience comes to know Morgan is a good one (we never know from one episode to the next whether to hate her or have pity for her) and Merlin is perhaps one of the greatest, most ambiguous depictions of the character in recent film. Alas, Starz' emphasis on turning the story into a soft-core porn romp leaves much to be desired.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|In the early nineties, a book series by L. J. Smith became popular that featured a young woman caught between two immortal brothers. The series introduced witches, vampires, and werewolves onto bookstore shelves and inspired some of the plot twists in the Buffy series, as well as the Twilight saga. While many changes have been made from the source material in bringing the series to the small screen, it maintains the creepiness and romantic edge of the books.<br /><br />It has been six months since the Gilberts' car plunged through the railing of a bridge outside town and the parents drowned in the river. Elena (Nina Dobrev) was pulled free of the wreckage and managed to survive, but has been left orphaned along with her brother Jeremy (Stephen R. McQueen). Living with their aunt Jenna (Sara Canning) and struggling to keep her brother out of trouble, Elena soon encounters the handsome and mysterious Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Tall, dark and charming, it doesn't take long for romantic sparks to ignite between them, much to the envy of her friends Caroline (Candice Accola) and Bonnie (Katerina Graham). What Elena does not realize is that Stefan is a vampire who abandoned the region years earlier and has returned to watch over her since Elena reminds him profoundly of Katherine, a woman he loved and lost during the Civil War. But her presence and his attentiveness have brought another immortal to town: his older and far more ruthless brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Having feuded over Katherine more than a century earlier, Damon has sworn to make Stefan \\"suffer for all eternity,\\" and to do that he intends to corrupt Elena. Seducing Caroline into a relationship and injecting himself into Stefan's world, Damon is a growing threat and his brutal behavior around town sets off warning bells to those old enough to remember the last time the local vampires were out of control. In the meantime, Bonnie is dealing with the realization that she has magical powers, and all herinstincts are warning her that Elena is not safe - especially around Stefan.<br /><br />When I first heard about this series I was not impressed, but the strength of the season as it gained momentum convinced me it is one of the most well thought out and paced shows on television. The writing is tremendous, full of constant twists and turns and minor revelations that build toward an intense finale. Fans of the book series should be forewarned, however, that only minor similarities to the novel remain. The characters are much altered in significant ways and other individuals are simply excluded altogether. Most of the history of the Salvatore brothers remains somewhat intact but the differences are noticeable. However, it does maintain the strength of the book in the fact that it accurately represents the creepiness of the original works. Everyone is great in their respective roles, but Somerhalder is particularly good as Damon. We are never quite certain if he is trustworthy but at the same time our interest in him continues to expand. Later on, two notable regulars join the cast -- Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis) as a professor with a dark secret, and Elena's sinister uncle (David Anders).<br /><br />There are several underlining mysteries that surround the town and its unusual heritage, and flashbacks provide an excuse to show off lovely Civil War costumes. It promises a twist ending every week and more than delivers. It features wonderful performances, a terrific soundtrack that includes a lot of popular songs, and immense creativity in its characters. It pays homage to the original books but strikes out in a new direction that leaves its audience hanging.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Although this product has protected my Kindle Fire from damage I am dissatisfied with the material used in the product. There is a non-slip coating on the back side of the product that at 2 weeks was already beginning to separate from the cover. Now at a little over 3 months it's much worse. This case is always in its own pocket in my backpack and the coating was unable to stand up to the rigors of a daily commute. Also the cutout for the Fire to stand is not deep enough. It slips all the time, I have to hold it with my free hand thus eliminating my free hand. I don't hate this product I just believe small modifications would have made this an \\"Outstanding Product\\" instead of just something else that needs to be replaced.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|Based on the recent memoirs of a filmmaker and producer, My Week With Marilyn follows a budding romance surrounding one of the most difficult film shoots of Marilyn Monroe's career.<br /><br />Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) has always wanted to be involved in movies, and he is determined enough to stick around the executive studios until he is hired as a 3rd assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The world-renowned stage actor is preparing to direct and star in a movie opposite the beautiful Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), but has little idea of what he is in for. Marilyn proves deeply insecure, temperamental, is frequently late to the sound stage, and fusses at the drop of a hat. Laurence is at the end of his rope, but Colin has more compassion for the American diva, who is newly married and in spite of her global success, deeply unhappy.<br /><br />Circumstances throw them together and a friendship sparks that threatens Colin's attempts to woo one of the costume girls (Emma Watson). But as the shoot continues, he finds in Marilyn a young woman in a gilded cage, longing for freedom but without the courage to reach out and take it with both hands.<br /><br />This film relies on impersonations of actors that everyone is familiar with -- from Laurence Olivier to his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormand). It seems strange to me then that none of the actors involved bear any resemblance to their cinematic counterparts, much less attempt in any way to impersonate them. I've heard glowing reviews of everyone involved but there was never a moment when I was convinced Branagh was Olivier, Ormand was Leigh, or Williams was Marilyn. None of them even bothered to alter their voice that much, which meant that element of the film was sorely missing. That aside, it is quite a wonderful period piece, full of gorgeous costumes and a cast that doesn't go ten minutes without introducing someone well known to costume drama fans. From Derek Jacobi to Michael Kitchen, it is not short on talent.<br /><br />What the movie meant to convey and what it wound up revealing are two different things, but I often found myself frustrated with Marilyn and I'm not sure that is the emotion I was meant to have. The musical score is lovely and the script is fluid. Even though the lack of impersonations was disappointing for me, I quite enjoyed this film, not so much as its exploration of a certain week in time as for the heart that the actors put into it. Maybe they aren't carbon copies of their famous counterparts, but for the most part, they are trying their best. It's not perfect, but it is memorable and for that reason alone, I may return to it from time to time.
B007LEC7CC|1.0|I did not buy the album but I did hear the clips thinking at least a few of them would catch me. Come to find out none of them got me at all. Every clip sounds like something from an old archive she had stashed away of rejected songs from the 80's. Most of the clips I did not let finish.  I'm just saying... its awful. Madonna, I love you but I am not in love with you right now.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Though book fans may not care for the direction in which this show is headed, most of us tuned in for each new episode knowing we were in for quite an experience. Becoming stronger and more mature in its second season, The Vampire Diaries is not for the faint of heart... and we wouldn't want it to be.<br /><br />Katherine has returned. The charming, beautiful vampire who first turned Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) in the aftermath of the Civil War has arrived in Mystic Falls, much to the horror of her doppelganger and Stefan's current girlfriend, Elena (Nina Dobrev). And she's out to have some, well, fun. The intensely jealous vampire has no interest in allowing the lovers peace and threatens to harm Elena's brother Jeremy (??) and her aunt Jenny (??) if they don't break up. But her actions toward the unhappy duo are just a smokescreen - she has something much more exciting planned that involves an ancient curse and a precious moonstone. Unfortunately for all of them, Caroline (Candice Accola) is caught up in the mix. Near death after a car accident, she is visited by Katherine and given a dose of vampire blood and a broken neck. She awakens with a hunger for blood and uncertainty as to where this new twist of fate will lead her. Bonnie (Katerina Graham) is struggling with her powers as a witch, and holds a growing hatred for vampires that may unleash a tide of violence.<br /><br />But Caroline is not the only one questioning her existence... as it seems the werewolf gene in the Lockwood family has been activated. Mason intends on ending Damon (if Damon doesn't end him first) but his nephew Tyler is about to experience the real traumas of the family curse. And that doesn't even cover the new vampires in town, the arrival of the warlocks, or the re-emergence of an ancient evil even Katherine is terrified of...<br /><br />Creating quite a stir due to its daring and sometimes scandalous ad campaigns, those unfamiliar with the material wouldbe surprised to learn that this series is tamer than the previews might suggest. It has a solid cast that is ever expanding, continuity in its ongoing arcs, and never fails to stretch out in new and exciting directions. Fans of the love triangle in particular will like certain scenes and implications this season, as we find out how Damon truly feels about Elena. The first half is a lot of fun with the return of Katharine and the transformation of Caroline into a vampire, the next batch of episodes deals with the werewolf problems, and finally the season ends by returning to the beginning and the implications of both curses. In terms of storytelling it's solid and week to week breaks out surprises, which is one of the reasons it is so popular. It is a smart show and that is not often found in programming aimed at young adults.<br /><br />It goes without saying that this series is edgy and controversial. It contains all the elements your grandmother would hate -- vampires, werewolves, and witches, which may be why it is so popular among young adults. It's that touch of forbidden attraction that we all harbor deep inside. If the description put you ill at ease, it's a safe bet you won't want to try it out.

0062119044|5.0|\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is intimate, violent, honest, and frightening -- a reasing experience that has left me feeling weak with astonishment -- what a story.<br /><br />I need to address two of the criticisms mentioned in the reviews:<br />First of all, the reason \\"they don't get help for Kevin\\" is because the father, Franklin, does not think his child needs help. That is one of the major problems with the family -- Franklin never believes Eva's concerns, and always sides with Kevin over his wife. (Although mom-ambivalance is part of the story it is Franklin who is actually the more annoying parent).<br /><br />It also beautifully raises the issue of nuture versus nature. Eva gives birth to Kevin, so she is in fact his \\"nature,\\" but he lacks nothing by way of nurturing, since his father worships him. On the other hand, Eva's loving \\"nature\\" is present with the birth of Celia, who turns out to be an angel -- despite the fact that in her case, Franklin provides zero nurturing. That whole question of the two \\"n\\"s is raised in a very interesting way.<br /><br />The \\"big words\\" criticism disturbs me, because honestly, there was nothing in this book that I didn't understand the first time through, and I don't consider myself the most brilliant person on earth. I am astounded that anyone would think this author has used words that are \\"too big.\\" There is nothing in this novel that is pretentious or overdone -- the words percfectly create the mood and tone.<br /><br />I think this book is incredible, though certainly difficult. It is not for everyone, but if you find it and love it, you will be catapulted into a frightening words where little boys are terrifying, and having children is not all sunlight and roses.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|There are two reasons why I love this product. First, because of the content itself, and second the amazing job they did in this Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />The Muppet movie is surprisingly (and consistently throughout) hilarious. Just like the old Muppets, it is full of subtle, unhighlighted in-jokes, references, and celebrity cameos. In fact, I am not sure what percentage of people who saw the movie understood all the references. I'm sure although I caught a bunch I didn't catch them all. All the jokes are funny for all ages, and had me thinking of silly moments and chuckling for weeks after (Such as \\"Why does everybody forget about Hobo Joe!?\\")<br /><br />From a moral message standpoint, the Muppets shines out like many good Disney movies with a story about following your dreams, growing up, and never giving up. I don't have kids yet, but years from now I can't wait to sit with them and watch The Muppets together.<br /><br />This is also one of the best formatted Blu-Rays I've ever watched, and I really appreciate the extra work they put into it.<br /><br />From the start, there is a message saying which button to press to skip the ads. It's a little touch that makes me not mind the fact there are a bunch of trailers that auto play. Although, some of the trails were pretty nice, I do like being able to watch the new Brave trailer in high definition. the extra features are totally worth watching as well. Such as the mini-documentary (edited in such a way to reference the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy British miniseries) that is full of behind the scene footage featuring the \\"off-screen Muppets\\" that supposedly helped film the movie.<br /><br />There a tons of little secrets and quirks as well. I recommend at some point during the movie when you feel like taking a break to pause the movie for a while, and enjoy the \\"Intermission\\" show that comes on. I mean, on what other Blu-Ray can you say that you can sit down and watch the pause screen for 10+ minutes?<br /><br />On top of all that, for one price you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital versions of the movie, in addition to the full Soundtrack. That's a pretty good value, I specifically really enjoy getting the Soundtrack for free as the music in the movie is so good/funny I was planning on purchasing it anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend all Blu-Ray owners, or potential future Blu-Ray owners buy this three disc combo pack.s?<br /><br />On top of all that, for one price you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital versions of the movie, in addition to the full Soundtrack.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Everything that can be said has been said, the level of customization is amazing but the navigation is intuitive enough that anyone can setup the simplest routine or a very elaborate alarm schedule without getting a headache. Awesome app! The timer is a nice added bonus, although I have used it only once. Maybe a chronometer would be more useful, then again, so would be so many other things, the best thing about this app is its focus on the alarm task, and that's how I like it

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book hooked me from the first chapter.  It was engaging and a very scary portrait of a potential post-apocalyptic America.  However, when I borrowed the Kindle edition of The Hunger Games from the Amazon Kindle lending library, I didn't realize it was the first book in a trilogy.  You can only borrow one book a month from the library so I have to wait until April to read the second book and May to read the third!!  I don't want to give away any spoilers but the trailer for the movie (out today...3/23/2012) gives away one tiny part of the first part of the book.  I would highly recommend that you read the book before seeing the movie because, in my opinion, the movies are never as good as the books are, and this book is marvelous!!  Good job Ms. Collins!!

B004QOB8SY|5.0|A brilliant series. I don't know how anyone can dislike this show. Sherlock Season 1 was awesome. Benedict and Freeman performed amazingly, while the supporting cast(especially the woman playing Mrs. Hudson and Andrew Scott's Moriarty)rocked as well. Season Two is even better. The acting is ramped up a notch, the scripts are better for the most part, the overarching story is defined, and Benedict and Freeman really develop with their characters.<br />Episode One is entitled \\"A Scandal in Belgravia.\\" When I saw this episode, I felt that it was the best and most cinematic episode till date. Sherlock has to crack the code of Irene Adler's camera phone. The case is awesome and the episode has a very espionage feel to it. The sequence in the airport is beautiful. Needless to say, the solution is pretty mind blowing. 10/10<br />The second episode, \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" isn't as good as the previous episodes, but still better than \\"The Blind Banker\\"(still a good episode). Being the worst episode of the season still means it is a very solid episode. The first and third acts are very good. It's just the middle part that drags a bit, lessening the experience. 8.8/10 i guess<br />The last episode of this season is absolutely frigging stupendous. I was clapping and near tears at the end of this 90 minute episode. Moriarty attempts to tear apart Sherlock's life in every way. Sherlock isn't a loser though. After an awesome heist scene, trial, and conversation between our hero and villain, the episode is a fantastic sequence of mystery, chases, and character revelations. 10/10<br />This season as well as the first deserve a standing ovation.

0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins, the award winning author of Hunger Games, continues Katniss' story in this, the second book in the trilogy, Catching Fire.  \\"A mokingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist.

They hadn't anticipated its will to live.\\"<br /><br />As wedding plans move forward for the most popular tribunes in Panem, big changes take place in district 12 . Though the Capital strives to keep it secret, it becomes apparent to Katniss that there is unrest, even rebellion, in many of the  districts. The Capital strikes out to quell the rebellion at the same time that the special Hunger Games known as the Quell, which occur every 75 years, takes place. Even with the Capital's power and plans, they cannot control and anticipate everything. They are faced, so to speak, with another mockingjay. You might even say there is a chink in their armor.<br /><br />The well thought out plotting, the thrilling suspense, and strong, realistic characterizations are all as brilliant as they were in Hunger Games. If you've read Hunger Games, then Catching Fire is a must read. Both books are on my shelf as keepers. I highly recommend Catching Fire.

B005OYKI1I|4.0|Thanks for sending me an email to review a film I seen 4 months ago! Reviewed on 3/27/12. It was a great movie for what I can remember. Alot of action scenes and stunts! The film was entertaining throughout. The stunts were thought out extremely well and executed perfectly. I recommend this film
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I work with kids with Asperger's and this kid did a perfect job. One reviewer thought he wasn't enough like a real kid. Well, Asperger's kids are different. They're often exactly like this kid.<br />A perfect movie. I can't imagine a better one being made about 911. Incredibly moving and extremely sad. Very, very well-written. Amazing....
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Ok I ordered this movie expecting a professional DVD. What I got was a cheap looking remake that is handwritten on a cheap DVD.<br />What's the deal? This is not the quality I have come to expect from Amazon.<br />Please tell me this is a promotional thing and we are not paying people to dub films and copy them onto cheap materials. May be my last order for a while.

B005G4TJUC|5.0|To each his own but let's get something straight. Don't try and sound like you're more intelligent than you really are. Anyone that doesn't like this movie, fine. I love it! So don't try and be super philosophical and deep about the movie and tell me and others we shouldn't like it. Every movie has it's own appeal and goal. The one thing all movies should be trying to do is ENTERTAIN. It's a movie, not a commentary on life and history. This movie is called Transformers. What I expect is giant robots going to war with one side good vs the evil side. In this movie, I got giant robots going to war with one side good vs one side evil. This is not Shakespeare, people. I was not disappointed, especially following the letdown of the 2nd one. I loved the little plot twists too like Sentinel betraying the autobots and the humans siding with Decepticon deal. The jokes were not over the top like Revenge and the action was STELLAR. Michael Bay knows how to do action and he amped it up to 1000. And who needs Megan Fox?

I used to use Splash ID but had endless problems syncing with my Mac so switched to this app and like it so much better, especially now that my Android phone and Apple computer autosync through DropBox.

B006Z21ZEM|5.0|First off, don't listen to the whiners with their ridiculous one star reviews - Maiden is by far the greatest metal band on the planet, known not only for their innovative approach to creating great music, but for the sheer power of their spectacular live shows!<br />So what are the \\"whiners\\" sniveling about? Oh, a lot of the songs are the same as on previous live albums - really????<br />Of course a lot of songs are the same! - They are the definitive Maiden songs that everyone wants (and expects) the band to play when they see them live! In addition, the band adds the new material from the lastest release,(The Final Frontier), that is being performend for the first time live.<br />THIS IS WHAT A LIVE SHOW IS ALL ABOUT - a document of the bands live performance at a particular time/tour. Thus, the glory of listening to the band evolve during every new tour - some of the songs WILL stay the same (Can you even imagine a Maiden show without Number of the Beast being played? Then people would whine!!!)<br />It's an incredible feat that Iron Maiden is still able to do what they do so well, after all these years - absolutely immpecable musicianship and stellar vocals that never cease to amaze! Very few bands that began in the 1970's can come close to achieving that!<br />This live album is a document of The Final Frontier tour, and marks another point in the history of the band. That is the purpose of a live record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you feel the songs are \\"the same\\", then I am sure you don't go to any Maiden shows, since God forbid, they might play songs you've heard before! I've seen Maiden 7 times so far (with number 8 coming this July), and of course they play a lot of the same (older) material - that's why I go to the show! I want to hear the older classics and the new material!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Point being, this is an incredible live show, and a must own for any true Maiden fan. I own every live album the band has ever released, and LOVE them ALL!!!!!!! Why? Each is different in it's own way, whether they are playing classics or new material, since it provides a \\"snapshot\\" of the bands sound/live performance at that time (in this case 2010!) Yes, they do sound different than they did in 1983, 1993 or 2003 - that's the point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Don't listen to the \\"same old songs whiners\\" who don't appreciate a current live document of the world's greatest heavy metal band. If you are a true Maiden fan, you'll love this latest installment of the Iron Maiden live catalog!<br /><br />Up The Irons & Maiden On The Charge 2012!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I purchased this game when it first came out and my kids (6 & 3 yrs old) had a lot of fun with it. Recently I bought it again for a friend's kid as a birthday present but when the product arrived, it was actually my kids who first 'detected' the difference of the game's box(including the graphics and the material). Upon close observation(which you don't even need to) it turned out that the game is a counterfeit version which didn't even have the official Mattel logo.<br />The box was made of cheap thin cardboard and the graphics resemble the original version but some of the lettering was different, and the print quality was inferior. I could even tell the game pieces as seen through the clear plastic cover was lacking the vibrant colors and detailed paint job the original had.<br />To my surprise, the item was sold by Amazon and when I contacted them they sent me a replacement game(have to say they are always helpful!) unfortunately it was the same fake version. I had to head down to a local Target store and get the original at a slightly higher price but at least I would have no concerns about missing pieces or inferior quality parts.<br />Check your box first to see if you have the Mattel logo or not. Lack of the logo is the first sign of a fake product.

1409115372|2.0|I really wanted to love this book after all the positive reviews. I was hopeful it would be a legal thriller along the lines of \\"Presumed Innocent\\". Not even close. It started out ok, but became tedious and predictable. The characters weren't sufficiently developed. It had great potential, but just didn't deliver.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions is one of Madonna's best albums period. Every song on here flows well, and they are all catchy. While songs like Hung Up, Sorry, and Future Lovers are just great pop songs like she usually does, she is able to make some emotional dance songs like How High and Push. Not many dance albums have introspective lyrics, but they're here, and it's still lots of fun. The album still sounds fresh in 2012, and not all music from this time has aged as well. If you like pop and/or dance music, Confessions is an absolute must have.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Stenzgy's 1 Star rating is a joke. I have been using an Ipaq running Windows Mobile 2003 since the Fall of 2002 and it had a great, simple to use calculator.

B00000HZFH|5.0|the rare occasions i've found it imperative to write a review myself:<br />ok computer/the bends - radiohead<br />animals - pink floyd<br />jar of flies - alice in chains<br />violent femmes - violent femmes<br />come on pilgrim - pixies<br />iii - led zeppelin<br />sister - sonic youth<br />locust abortion technician - butthole surfers<br />songs fro the deaf - queens of the stone age*<br /><br />so i heard about the band through a cable show called Tim and Eric, and bored i looked them up, decided to get a copy of \\"perfect from now on\\" and wow, i hadn't heard anything that resonated with me like that album had in at least 4 years, i had inadvertently stumbled upon one of those albums that i'll be driving down the street, 10 years from now and be listening to, still completely immersed in the power of the genius of the music...<br />beyond that let me digress, this review is about \\"keep it like a secret\\"... what can i say, i didn't like it when i first heard it, well, lets not go that far, i first thought, hmm, this is no \\"perfect, etc...\\" but there seems to be some pretty well compiled tracks, i put it down and went back to my new black keys record.<br />what happened next, you may be asking? i got bored of the new black keys and my over-listened to, arcade fire and decided to give that old, scratched up cppy of \\"keep it like a secret\\" another try. so i threw it in, and throught the course fo what i would call a 24 hour period of interrupted play... I GOT IT!<br />so here it is:<br />coming, fresh out of \\"perfect from now on\\", you might be a bit taken aback by the, \\"simplicity\\" of this album, but rest assured, upon applied ear, you see that they sacrifice sprawling solo for a more focused song delivery. that being said, \\"the plan\\" flies at you full throttle, giving you an impression of the tempo of the rest of the album, quick, sweeping and beautiful. next comes \\"center of the universe\\" now for me, this song stuck, a great, catchy, powerful track that i can continue listening to and not get tired of. pretty much, the first half of the album is flawless. engaging, strong and incredibly focused. then after the halfway mark comes \\"time trap\\", and wow, an absolute epic, if there were to be an epic of the album (something that \\"perfect from now on\\" compiled a complete library of). the next song \\"else\\" starts out with a strumming guitar, then Martsch, the lead singer and  main songwriter begins the vocals, and its a mix between a beautifully atmospheric track and an anthem, next of course come the unforgettable \\"you were right\\" which includes quotes for the great music, and its an absolute joy of a song.<br />the album closes with \\"broken chairs\\", the second \\"epic\\" of the album, complete, beautiful, uncompromising, sad, inspiring, it can really sweep emotion to your heart upon substantial listening, screw that, i was impressed the first time i heard it. a truly beautiful closer to a genius album!<br />now, before i close, i never thought i would be able to find such connection to music that has so many hooks, such great, popular, grabbing riffs as \\"keep it like a secret\\", thankfully, the mainstream radio bigwigs listened to the albums name and 'kept it like a secret', i ain't complaining, because when i finally got the album, it blew me away, as it will you too, as will all of you, but it, it is well worth it!<br /><br />*if you don't like these bands it don't matter, \\"bts: is still its own band, very original

B00756GKBA|5.0|It's been 4 years since Madonna has released an album, and Hard Candy wasn't the greatest. However, she is back in the new decade with MDNA. I love the album so far. Standout tracks for me include I'm Addicted, Turn Up the Radio, Masterpiece, Gang Bang, and Love Spent. People may say that Madonna is old and should retire, but MDNA proves that she can still make great pop music with the best of them. The songs can be fun, but they can also be deeply personal, and few artists do this like Madonna. Forget Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj, Madonna is still the Queen!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|An astonishingly good ap for getting the things swirling around in your head organized. Love this! Changing my life in the best ways.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|I was unfortunate enough to watch Quarantine in theaters first, and while it's not a bad movie on it's own, it's representation of one year later remakes is a baffaling and stupid idea that Quarantine represents. If you haven't seen either really just watch the original if you can find it somewhere.<br /><br />Anyways the story is pretty simple and has probably been explained countless times already on this site so I'll just skip that, but the plot and setting set up a stifling sense of claustrophobia and dread, similar to John Carpenter's The Thing. Lots of zombie movies like to squeeze the survivors between the zombie theat and the trigger happy military threat, however [REC] kept the military aspect nice and simple instead of trying to make some political point. The zombies themselves looked great too, they were drenched in blood, twitched around, and had a stark-raving mad look in their eyes while making wheezing noises. The scares themselves were good because they weren't cheap. What most American horror filmmakers seem to misunderstand is that startling the audience isn't the same as scaring them, just because your movie goes \\"BOO! HAHA MADE YOU JUMP YOU MUST BE SCARED NOW\\" doesn't mean it's scary. [REC] instead sets up it's atmosphere to great effect, and the zombies don't just jump out behind someone like in the Talking Dumb (a great lesson in how NOT to do zombies).<br /><br />Overall [REC] is very effective because it's simplicity and it knows how to set up and maintain a great atmosphere. The ending itself is especially effective when you imagine being thrust into a blackout. A must for any zombie fan.
B002BWP49C|5.0|So I love Twilight and I don't care if you think that's lame...  Well I kind of do, but I'm still going to defend my right to get all giddy when Rob Pattinson hits the screen - tweens be damned.<br /><br />The movie arrived quickly, in one piece and played in the DVD player.  I'm pretty sure that's all you can ask for in this situation.<br /><br />If we were doing movie reviews I would give this 4 stars or two thumbs WAY up.  It's an awful movie if you really break it down into the normal movie reviewing categories, but IF you consider the fact that this is NO ordinary movie and shouldn't be judged on superficial things like \\"cinematography\\" or \\"acting then you have yourself a timeless piece of movie history.<br /><br />In all seriousness, I love the shiz out of these movies in spite of their awfulness.

B00004Z459|5.0|POST-HYBRID THEORY:<br />Ever since Minutes to Midnight, the fans drifted apart, kind of like when CAPCOM released Resident Evil 4. Similar to Resident Evil 4, Minutes to Midnight got better reviews (from critics, like Rolling Stone), but whenever there's a great change or shift in artistic direction, there will be a drifting apart of a fan base. This happened to Linkin Park because the \\"OLD\\" fans (who unrightfully consider themselves \\"TRUE\\" fans, sorry to say) hold Hybrid Theory to such a dang high standard. But here's the thing: Linkin Park is Linkin Park is Linkin Park; they changed their genre, but not their \\"vibe,\\" if that makes any sense; their music is still moody and atmospheric, and if you listen to a Minutes to Midnight or A Thousand Suns sound on the radio for the first time, you'll know right away, \\"Hey, that's Linkin Park.\\" They still got it and they still are making music that other bands cannot match in style or talent or tone.<br /><br />PRE-HYBRID THEORY:<br />Nu Metal was blowing up because of Korn, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed and System of a Down. And here comes the new guys, the Linkin Park dudes, the band that I honestly didn't give a chance because they came out of nowhere and blew up the music scene. They were too popular for my taste, so I wouldn't have nunna that, no sir. But here they were, each song a juggernaut of some sort of catchiness.<br /><br />AND THEN I LISTENED TO IT:<br />And I was blown away by the emotional impact that listening to the album from beginning to end had on me. It's been many years, and I've listened to the album way too many times, but I can remember each song as if they were a child of mine.<br /><br />PAPERCUT: 5/5<br />Okay, here's a song that I think every twelve to sixteen year old boy or girl can relate to; that everyone's out to get your. That people are talking about you people your back. The song has the fastest tempo on the entire album and it's a smart idea to start it off with a bang. The the word \\"papercut\\" is never in the song, but I think it represents that the song will give you a mental papercut; it'll make you suck your thumb while you listen to the other songs.<br /><br />ONE STEP CLOSER: 4/5<br />Immediately after the fastest song on the album, it's followed up by the hardest one. One Step Closer was never one of my favorite songs. But I respected the fact that even in Hybrid Theory (foreshadowing their career in general), they could shift music styles like snapping fingers. Also, I didn't like the anger in this song. But, trust me, there were days when this was my favorite song . . .<br /><br />WITH YOU: 5/5<br />I think this is my favorite song on the album. In a lot of ways it captures the emotions that I had going through a couple of my middle school/high school break ups.<br /><br />POINTS OF AUTHORITY: 3/5<br />One of my old friends who hated Linkin Park came up to me and asked me what my least favorite song was. I said Points of Authority. Funny thing is that was their favorite song. I think it's because this song tries a little too hard to be commercially successful and hip. It always seemed a little to repetitious for me.<br /><br />CRAWLING: 4/5<br />The music video always helped me swallow this song a little easier for some reason. It was a weird mixture between a hard song and a ballad, and I think it was unsettling. But it also made the song unique. And it's one of the songs that defines Hybrid Theory, so what's not to love?<br /><br />RUNAWAY: 5/5<br />To me it seems like Runaway is always the song that just . . . runs away. I had a friend that listened to EVERY LINKIN PARK song via radio or ipod, but had never listened to Runaway. He didn't know it. But this song is great based on the fact that the verses are so great and moody and really captures the sound and concept of the album as a whole.<br /><br />BY MYSELF: 5/5<br />By Myself is the equivalent of Meteora's Hit the Floor; it's got a little too much rapping for the rock fans and a little too much singing for the rap fans; a little too much guitar for the fans of their more melodic stuff. But, I've always connected to the song because for a lot of my youth I felt like I was by myself . . .<br /><br />IN THE END: 5/5<br />Everyone and their mothers can know a couple of lyrics in this song. This song was probably one of the nails in the Nu Metal genre's coffin. It is the best song on Hybrid Theory and because of it, it was played over and over and over and over and over again . . .<br /><br />A PLACE FOR MY HEAD: 5/5<br />Perhaps it's this song that really personifies the entire album. It fuses the rap in rock in such ways that it's really quite impressive. It's this kind of song that Linkin Park has strayed from. And, if they go back to making these kind of songs, would they still be good? I don't know to be honest.<br /><br />FORGOTTEN: 5/5<br />It's the equivalent to Nobody's Listen (Meteora), Hands Held High (Minutes to Midnight) and When They Come For Me (A Thousand Suns). In other words, this is perhaps Mike's strongest rapping on the album.<br /><br />CURE FOR THE ITCH: 3/5<br />Instrumental. I don't care for it. But it does have its moments I must admit.<br /><br />PUSHING ME AWAY: 5/5<br />This song is certainly the song that every adolescent knows about; every kid has felt this way. It's because of how it relates to the listener and how the listener feels and how the song sounds that makes it so DANG good.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />It's a great album; it's not as tasteful as A Thousand Suns, but it certainly strums a chord in each listener's heart. It makes you feel something, whereas Minutes and Suns make you think. That's the biggest difference in their change of direction, but still, it seems as though Hybrid Theory is one of the most acclaimed albums of all time. And for good reason: it was the apoheosis and the extinction-catalyst of the Nu Metal genre.oo much singing for the rap fans; a little too much guitar for the fans of their more melodic stuff.

0525478817|5.0|There are plenty of reviews outlining the story, but I loved this book so much that I had to say so.  The main characters, Hazel and Gus, are smart and witty; perhaps they know too much for being teenagers, but if you can overlook that, you will be treated to not just their story, but their amazing outlook on life. They want their lives to count for something, to be remembered after they are gone, and to leave as few scars as they can. I laughed out loud at their humor, enjoyed their romance, contemplated life and the universe, and cried my eyes out while being unable to set the book down. The Fault in Our Stars is easy to read while being intelligent and full of truth.  Two thumbs up!

0439023521|5.0|I picked up the first Hunger Games book on Tuesday, read all night, and downloaded the second book at 2am. Excellent series of books. It reminded me of some of the later works of Ayn Rand. I am usually not a fan of books written in the first person, but this book did it well. I was expecting a Twilightish read and was pleasently surprised at the depth of the charcters and development of the plot.
0439023521|5.0|I started The Hunger Games in the evening. Eight hours later, I finally summoned one small spark of the courage of its heroine and stopped with a quarter of the book left! As soon as I awoke a few hours later, I checked the condition of my burns and cuts and was surprised to find that they had healed. No, that wasn't it; those things had only happened to characters in a book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games film-release buzz intrigued me enough to dive into the book before visiting the theater. I had previously only heard superficial mentions of a dark, brutal story and did not become interested until some of the advance film reviews suggested that the story might actually convey significant and thoughtful content in an action package. It does.<br /><br />This is a fresh addition to the list of classic dystopian dramatic critiques of the state that work by showing what the state does to society and human beings in a magnified, allegorical form. The author's choice of a close first-person voice and sympathetic main character transform the central state's artificial battle game show into a very human landscape in the context of a post-apocalyptic North America. The nature of zero-sum game-making is revealed through a specific set of living eyes.<br /><br />Katniss has been a part-time hunter and gatherer from early childhood. In a starving coal district, she became the sole provider for her unstable mother and younger sister after her father's death in a mine explosion. She supports her family by recalling her father's lessons and becoming an illegal hunter in the forest outside the dilapidated District-12 security fence. Officials avoid arresting or shooting her or Gale, her hunting partner, because the officials themselves enjoy buying wild game, vegetables, berries, and herbal products from them.<br /><br />Katniss and Gale find a small frontier of liberty in the forest outside the state's fence and a thriving black market inside it. Outside the fence is also the only place they can speak their true thoughts about their district's poverty and the injustice of the center's rule. The relative ease of honesty and authenticity in private and the necessity of being fake and false under surveillance is a recurring theme.<br /><br />She inevitably ends up in the games. Why do players in the Hunger Games not just join together and refuse to fight? The state's experienced \\"Game Makers\\" have carefully considered and adjusted for this over the years. For example, they build into the vast land reserve selected as each year's \\"arena\\" certain prepared unnatural disasters they can trigger if things get too boring for the viewing audience. Players are also uncertain just how much of the arena environment is really natural. What they do know is that too long a stalemate or too much productive cooperation will lead the Game Makers to cause elements of this environment to start injuring or killing players, ruling out long-term survival for more than one.<br />Suzanne Collins<br /><br />I found in this a telling allegory. The state's Game Makers are working not to solve the zero-sum dilemma of game theory, but to make sure that win/win cooperation is sufficiently forbidden that a zero-sum game remains the only option. The game is carefully rigged to stifle natural human cooperation and maintain artificial conflict. Thus, the people, both in the game and in their home districts, are left with less time, energy, or opportunity to turn their attention to standing side-by-side and perceiving their true common enemies -- those who set them up to play their life roles under constructed zero-sum terms.<br /><br />This book succeeds stunningly in its dramatic structure, brevity, and execution. Perhaps the \\"young adult\\" rubric has even aided in omitting the unnecessary and focusing squarely on story. As it turns out, though, these are the hallmarks of any good book and here we find a level of content, theme, and execution that should by no means be considered suitable only for a teen audience. To be precise, I think the book is easily interesting enough for adults, even those with only slight sci-fi leanings, though unsuitable for younger children who lack the tools needed for healthy digestion of such complex and intense material.<br /><br />Futuristic technical and biotech science-fiction elements, including a range of bioweapon species called \\"muttations\\" still living decades after their use in the war, are generally believably rendered and add texture without upstaging human drama. The socio-political situation presented is on the simplistic side, but seems sufficient to do its core job of supporting the story. Besides, we are only seeing first-person through the young character's eyes based on her limited information about the wider world she inhabits. This makes the amount of socio-political detail that readers see realistic from her viewpoint.<br /><br />This story encourages questioning and acts of humanity even in the face of the zero-sum games the state tries to limit us to on various kinds of battlefields, both metaphorical and real. Few more important core messages can be smuggled to young people -- or anyone else. This book can encourage us to look beyond artificial win/lose and lose/lose games and create cooperative win/win person-to-person relationships that reestablish islands of truth and rightness within whatever enclaves we might manage to construct against dystopian backdrops.d suitable only for a teen audience.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, 3D was still in its infancy but I was hooked.  Never would I have imagined that years later I could watch it again in 3D at home.  When it came out on Blu Ray with the cheesy colored glasses included I snatched up a copy.  That was quite disappointing.  However, now we have a genuine 3D Blu Ray and I have to say they did a really good job with it.  The transfer was excellent and the 3D really pops at times.  Regular \\"not in your face\\" scenes looked great as well.  I watched it with several friends and I heard \\"Whoa!!\\" quite a few times.  They enjoyed it as much as I did :-)  The story is not complex but its very entertaining and a great family movie.  If you have the 3D equipment this movie is a must have.

There are times when it seems slow, but the encounters will the trolls definitely break up the monotony.  Ending was kinda strange.  But the biggest thing that made this movies premise unrealistic, is that the government is able to keep the existense of these huge trolls a secret from the general public all by the ONE troll-hunter in the whole country.  But this movie isnt meant to be taken THAT seriously.

Sometimes when I try to get the eggs that are very high in the air, and I have to use the yellow bird, the ads come up, and I can't see the egg!

Sometimes there's times without the ads, and I don't know how that's possible, because they always come up, but I am more focused at that time, so it's almost 100% for me but it's not.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is one of the best show on tv ever! Even if your not into zombies you will no doubt love it.Sometimes it is alil slow but you can't have zombies all the time there would be no built up to the show and it would get stale. Yes there are some useless characters on the show but you can't love all of them.season 2 final episode was amazing. if their was constant zombie attacks evey minute of every episode the final episode wouldn't have been as great. AMC must be doing something right season 2 last episode had 9 million viewers not to shaby!
0439023513|5.0|There are a few twists and turns in this book. I couldn't put it down, just like the first 2 books.  Also, I liked the ending.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|First off I'll admit that I am a Zombie lover, always have been, and may be biased however, that being said this is still a great book.  Even if you're a not a Zombie fan this is still a great read because of the characters.  The stories themselves really wrap you up; similar to the way The Walking Dead on AMC wraps you up if you've seen that.  Once you realize that Max Brooks could be talking about any large scale tragedy it really gets you thinking.  Take the Zombies out and add a race war or nuclear holocaust, or pandemic and the story sticks.  Much of the book is based on real life issues and scenarios, which I thought was excellent and thought provoking.<br /><br />The story is that of a reporter some 12 years (don't quote me) after the start of \\"World War Z\\".  He travels the world interviewing survivors from many different countries and walks of life.  The book itself is basically broken down into three parts: the begining of the plague, the fight, and the recovery processes.  The reader gets a great account of nearly every major country in the world and how they have handled the whole ordeal.  The human aspect of these stories is what really digs in with the reader.  How we, as humans, delt with loss, tragedy, fear, and uncertainty allows us to \\"feel\\" what the characters felt.<br /><br />The writer addresses the technology of the day (early part of the year 2000s, again don't quote me), what worked and what didn't.  You get to see of technology advanced to the threat, and in one particular case how ancient technology made a comeback.  How governments re-structured, made mistakes, saved nations and affected the people that depended on them.<br /><br />I recommend this to a friend that doesn't care for Zombies or reading.  He read the whole book in two nights, and called the next day to talk about it and speculate on the upcoming movie.  I highly recommend this book and will most likely read it again myself.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|Starring a child or adolescent in any kind of action movie is a gamble, but to place them in an outspokenly serious one is a decisively dangerous risk. The best we've done so far is [[ASIN:B0008JIJ2E Ralph Macchio]], of whom there is one for every half-dozen [[ASIN:B00009QG6G Frankie Munizes]]. However, \\"Hanna\\" - the fourth film and action debut of director Joe Wright ([[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement]]) - strikes preciously rare ground in making teenager Saoirse Ronan believable as well as entertaining to a mature audience. It's definitely not everyman's action flick - a great deal of its strength relies on its genre-bending structure of thriller and bildungs motifs - but as someone who looks at all action fare with a skeptical eye, I can wholeheartedly recommend this one to whomever can approach it with an open mind.<br /><br />The story: Hanna (Ronan), a 16-year-old raised by her father (Eric Bana, [[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich]]) in isolation to be the perfect assassin, is dispatched on a mission across Europe to kill a ruthless intelligence agent deadset on her capture (Cate Blanchett, [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]).<br /><br />I admit, I had to watch this film more than once to begin appreciating it. The story (written by first-timer Seth Lochhead) thrives on ambiguity - the ambiguity of Hanna's true origin and that of the strange triangle between her, her father, and Cate Blanchett's character. Additionally, the globetrotting nature of the plot confused me, as the film goes from Finland to Morocco to Spain and finally Germany with the utmost nonchalance; the first transition is particularly jarring, making it feel as though we're entering a dream scene when Hanna suddenly enters a palm resort amidst camels and folks in robe and turbans. To counter potential discomfort with these aspects, you just need to remain alert and not expect the locations to pop up in text on the screen. The payoff of this is that you get to better enjoy a cast of surprisingly interesting characters: Hanna of course is always nice to watch in her ongoing introduction to society, and Cate Blanchett's deceptively complicated CIA-witch is more intriguing every time you watch her; additionally, Hanna tags along with a quirky bohemian family for some weirdly sweet scenes, and all the while she's pursued by a trio of German enforcers led by Tom Hollander ([[ASIN:B00005JP0F Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]) who for all the world could have jumped out of a Luc Besson or Quentin Tarantino picture.<br /><br />The action isn't overly abundant, but when it occurs, it's just the way I like it: up close & personal, with a good deal of martial arts but no explosions or car chases. Normally, I'd take account of the fact that none of the performers here are legitimate martial artists, but instead, I consider the movie an accomplishment for fight choreographer Jeff Imada ([[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum]]), who's got a knack for making non-fighters look legitimate without the need of stunt doubles. It helps that the fights are all pretty realistic: the five exchanges are relatively few and far between, but they stand out for their convincing design, full of counter-strikes and a few judo maneuvers. My personal favorite (the subway brawl) doesn't include Saoirse Ronan at all, but she's still a highlight when you see her taking on opponents larger than herself and overcoming them without needing them to feint blows or over-sell a strike. I'll admit, the fights aren't mind-blowing, but I honestly couldn't believe that I was watching the skinny shrimp from [[ASIN:B001QOGYAO The Lovely Bones]] the first time I saw her tussle. I have no reason to believe that Ronan will remain a regular of the action genre, and darnit I'm disappointed - this girl could outdo Cynthia Rothrock, given time and opportunity.<br /><br />My major qualm with the film is its ending: it doesn't so much sneak up on you as just end - it's like if [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW StarWars]] had gone to the credits right after everyone had escaped the Death Star for the first time. Maybe this is to set up a sequel, but it's still pretty disappointing if you've gotten as involved in the movie as I have. With that said, I'd be the first in line to see this hypothetical sequel, if I knew it were anything as good as this. \\"Hanna\\" isn't a film I'd use to introduce a complete newcomer to the action genre, but it'd definitely be on my list to demonstrate how diverse of stars and vehicles you can expect to find.Wars]] had gone to the credits right after everyone had escaped the Death Star for the first time.

B00008S2VG|5.0|From the moment she first burst onto the pop music scene at the beginning of the 1980's Madonna has represented two things. She's been a visually quotable cultural barometer as well as one of the few people who has participated in the evolution of 80's post disco up through modern dance music. She's continued to stick to what she is. And even if she hit's people different each time,can't say she's every exactly boring. Ever since her 1997 release [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]] her musical focus had moved decidedly away from her in your face sexual imagery and lustful atmosphere toward more of a personal dialog. After all she was now a wife and a mother as well. Of course one thing Madonna had not got out of her system was her ability at dealing with controversy. During the final year of  GW Bush's culturally difficult first presidential term Madonna decided to only address some possible concerns of the post 9/11 but,as usual in relation to herself. That being as self possessed as she always has been. Musically,things went in a direction I'm not sure anyone expected.<br /><br />  Madonna's first post millennial album finds her directly tackling the modern spirit of celebrities-as-news and war-as-entertainment social ethic. Produced and written with Mirwais Ahmadzai the title track of this album is a very modern 2-step tyle dance track. While the style went beyond overused (still is in my opinion),the lyrics are spot on when it comes to the all surface and no substance attitude of the modern age. It seems to anger and annoy Madonna,especially as celebrities of her generation are often major targets for creating the cultural standard she's railing against here. \\"Hollywood\\",\\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Love Profusion\\" blend in a lot of acoustic guitar based folk/rock in with milder dance rhythms,taking her earlier hybrids in this vein from her previous release [[ASIN:B00004X01U Music]] to the next level. The folk-rock sound takes further presidents on \\"Nothing Fails\\",\\"X-Static Process\\" and \\"Intervention\\" on which she's questioning everything from religion to her own celebrity. Only on the \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother And Father\\" do anything heavily resembling her earlier post disco dance music emerges as \\"Die Another Die\\",leaning more toward contemporary electropop and \\"Easy Ride\\" returns to the folkier sound from the middle of the album.<br /><br />  I don't think a lot of longtime Madonna fans regard this album very highly. It's not nearly as pop oriented as much of her previous music. While it presents her as someone with some genuine creative integrity it also gives one a look into what might just be a highly dysfunctional psyche,often more from without than from within. I think most people already knew Madonna had that side of her. But as long as she was making racy music videos and strong dance music,who cared? This album,with it's direct and often harsh lyrical stance even including some raps rather than singing, might have even altered some people's thoughts on Madonna. Not longer was she the \\"material girl\\" chameleon who could adapt to whatever color the pop world happened to have at any given time. She was now on a more defined musical and conceptual mission. But explorations of cultural politics and sociological dysfunction aren't exactly something that was all that associated with Madonna. Now the 90's decade that she was very successful in was defined by angst. But now there was genuine angst in society. One of a much more adult nature that Madonna,as she journeyed through middle aged decided to address. It's a sonically adventurous album. And part of a period of her musical output I'd describe as very creative.

1416955070|2.0|This story is a fast solution for boredom but falls flat in terms of plot originality and depth. It has a basic premise that conforms to a lot of traits of the archetypal hero cycle. As it is incredibly difficult to invent or create any original ideas these days, that is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel, at times, that the novel doesn't expand on any of these points or attempt to explore any deeper into the supernatural material that creates the setting, and that the author does not have a unique style to engender engagement in the reader. Often the addition of more creative details to a simple idea can present it as interesting. In addition, many of the major plot points utilize cliches: the love triangle that surrounds the protagonist, her childhood friend, and her &#34;bad boy&#34; love interest seems forced, and it created a false sense of drama that did not have any sort of suspense (I could easily tell that the &#34;bad boy&#34; came out victorious in the end), overall, diminishing the general plot of the story and diluting aspects (such as three-dimensional characterization, setting establishment, and major themes) that can give me a better impression that the story is truly unique.  On to the characters. The main character seemed bland and dull to me, because she doesn't appear to have any distinct, defining traits that could give me cause to support her journey - there are no establishing character moments that give me a full sense of her as a person. I do not consider her to be a &#34;Mary Sue&#34;, but the faults and imperfections she has in her personality are never mentioned, called out, or recognized. I feel her love interest is your typical bad boy: handsome, arrogant, prone to banter, and has heavily romanticized internal conflicts that are prone to being laughably over-dramatized. His personality faults never appear to be genuinely recognized either, causing the attempts to induce sympathy in the reader to fail. There are a couple of characters I actually am fond of in this novel because one is a female minor character that is still interesting to read about through the (sort of biased) eyes of the main character and has an established personality that has the potential for great development.. Magnus Bane is one of the real highlights of the novel despite his very short appearance. He is flamboyant, flirtatious, but has a serious side that serves as a counterbalance to some of his crazier traits. But even so, characters seem to be plugged and shaped to fit a single &#34;role&#34; (rather than the plot being shaped to fit the characters), and the author does not bother to expand on those roles or add depth and dimension - if the characters themselves do not appeal to me, I cannot get truly engaged in even the linear plot.  The City of Bones is a read for a dull, hot summer day, though I do not feel it is &#34;good literature&#34;. It is not so terrible that it needs a one star, but it is certainly not something intended for detailed literary analysis.jealous to Clary throughout the novel (and that could actually be used comically), but as it's revealed (minor spoiler) he's gay, a lot of his earlier actions suddenly snap into place. He's serious, thoughtful, and has never killed a demon, preferring to stay in a support-role and protect the others. Again, Cassandra Clare could really do better developing his personality. He's also one of the other characters I'm fond of.<br /><br />There are a couple of funny moments in the novel that give me something to laugh at, and it's moderately interesting, but Cassandra Clare doesn't really give anything original or imaginative to the supernatural society. Vampires, lycanthropes, etc. are nothing really creative. Magnus Bane, though, is one of the highlights of the novel despite his very short appearance. He's flamboyant, flirtatious, but has a serious side that serves as a counterbalance to some of his crazier traits. The City of Bones is a read that'll sate your boredom some hot summer day, though it's not exactly fine literature.

B0001GMIOE|1.0|I bought this battery as a backup for my Canon EOS 50 D. Do not buy this battery! It barely fits into the space designed for the battery and taking it our again becomes a major operation as the built in spring mechanism is not strong enough to push the battery up again.  I doubt that is is an original Canon battery.  Unfortunately I discovered this only after the return deadline had expired.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|To be totally truthful, the production levels of the music make this album stand alone without the vocals. It's hip hop to the point where if any artist realist vocals to these tracks it would have been a hit. However, add Madonna to this mix and it adds another level of epicness (spell check) to it. It's impossible not to like this album. The funniest part about it is every other song on the track is better than the lead single. Classic album loved it years ago and I still do.

It has the songs straight from the movie including the instrumental from the end credits - sweet!, and then just to be thorough they included some of the original artists versions. If you like the movie then buy it.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I picked up this book at my local library's used book sale with a bunch of other books because I had had my eye on it for a couple years but was never quite sure.  The summery on the back of the book interested me, but did not grab me to the point where I felt that I had to read it right now.  That said, I needed something to read as kind of a buffer to take me from my Hunger Games trilogy high into my next great read.  I didn't expect The Thirteenth Tale to be that next great read!<br /><br />This is the first book in a long time that has moved me to this extent.  There are stories inside stories and they are all told very well.  The characters are rich, bold, intriguing, and sometimes crazy.  The Thirteenth Tale pulled me in from the beginning and even though I've finished the book, it still has not let me go.<br /><br />There are so many puzzles and twists and turns throughout that will keep you guessing!  I didn't think any of it was disappointing at all.  I wasn't let down by any of the answers to the questions raised.  I will admit that sometimes you catch on to certain answers before the main character does, but there were other times where I thought I knew the answer to a puzzle and was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong.<br /><br />As for the main character, I really related with her.  This really is a novel for lovers of literature, people who have read their whole lives and cannot imagine a world without books.  She has an interesting relationship with her mother that hit home for me.  The bonds she forms with other characters she meets are very touching.<br /><br />Overall, this book is excellant.  I think if you are a lover of books who has experienced any kind of loneliness and/or loss in your life, this read will grow as close to your heart as it did mine.

0061992860|5.0|This is a great book, put together rather well in my opinion, I did not find it difficult to find information or to read the small print that comes in a small book. As I read the description first. This guy must have been a hoot to go backpacking or camping with let alone tromping thru the jungle with! Note- It's a survival book, not a hiking book. I read it from cover to cover the first day and found it quite informative and do not regret the purchase at all. $7 bucks for an interesting read and to have on hand in my pack, sweet. One book cannot cover everything, in every area, in every situation, even if it says it can- as things are always changing, but this guy comes pretty darn close. I actually like his old methods of doing things before the plugged-in age we live in now. And if any major catastrophe happens, we will all be back to the stone age anyway.<br /><br />A great companion along with Wilderness & travel medicine by Eric Weiss, both always in my pack. As a hiker it's good to be prepared, as many of us spur of the moment, fly by the seat of your pants, hell yes- let's go types, things happen.<br /><br />Bottom Line: read full description to know just what your getting, great inexpensive to have on hand!
B00756GKBA|1.0|This album is a huge disappointment.  The only standout tracks are Gang Bang and I *Bleeped* Up.  The rest is just a bunch of dated techno songs AutoTuned to death.

Here's a sample of the pathetic lyrics:<br /><br />SUPERSTAR - \\"You're a hotshot/You're my super-duper star\\" and \\"You can have the keys to my car/I'll play you a song on my guitar\\"<br /><br />I DON'T GIVE A - \\"Gotta call the babysitter/tweeting on the elevator\\"<br /><br />MASTERPIECE - \\"If you were Mona Lisa/You'd be hanging in the Louvre\\"<br /><br />B-DAY SONG - \\"And the beat goes on/I'm a happy girl/It's my birthday song/In my happy world\\"<br /><br />Just terrible that someone who used to be so great in the 80's and 90's is now singing garbage like this in her 50's.  Oh, and the William Orbit tracks sound completely dated, like he never left the late 90's.<br /><br />EDIT: Another comment - the mixing and mastering on this album are TERRIBLE!  I have to change my equalizer settings on whatever I play the songs on just so I can hear her vocals, which are burried by all the muddy bass.  Ugh!
B003ES61EE|5.0|I like having this on my bags for when a quick brushing is needed on the field. I don't use it to clean my lenses but to quickly remove any particle I see before attaching the lens.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Such a great read...takes you back to your childhood, as if you are the one visiting the circus!  Definately worth buying if you enjoy the lighter side of life with a little bit of fantasy on the side.
B007BLUD30|5.0|Loved this movie.  It was exciting and very funny.  Hubby and I really enjoyed it.  We didn't expect to enjoy it as much as we did.  A very pleasant surprise.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|I've been a fan of Spartacus since the first episode of the show.  Once you are introduced to the characters in the Ludus you get to see just how deep and fleshed out each character is.  Spartacus goes from a hot headed Thracian, to obedient champion of Capua, to the leader of a renegade group of warriors fierce enough to go against the roman empire.<br /><br />Andy Whitfield's illness and eventual death put the show on hiatus.  While they were waiting for his recovery they already had Liam McIntyre picked out with Andy's approval to continue on with the show if he was unable.  They also released a prequel to the first season called Gods of the Arena which introduced us to even more characters and further developed the history of the Ludus we see so much of in the first season.  The first seasons were fantastic and this continues the trend.<br /><br />Andy left some Titan sized shoes to fill but Liam has stepped up so far and delivered a great performance.  So much has changed since the fall of the house of Batiatus and sworn enemies are now true brothers, and visa versa.  Spartacus is now fighting for more than just his own life as he becomes a paragon for the enslaved populace of Rome.<br /><br />He vows to free all slaves, he vows to fight against Praetor Claudius Glaber, and he vows to have his vengeance.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|This movie just plain stunk . Everything they did just was wrong and never would have happened. Very very disappointing. Unbelievable and then the ending was the kicker which made it 10 x worse everyone in the theater even went you have got to be kidding me. The biggest waste of time and money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Tons of simple little games that take up a lot of time. I really like the concept of playing one to unlock the next. I'm a completionist when it comes to gaming so I guarantee I'll be putting hours into this. I was really surprised at how high of a quality the games are though, sure they are simple but pretty well done.
B000002VMD|5.0|What is there to say? Everybody loves this soundtrack. It is a classic. If you love Whitney's voice (and who doesn't) you will love this. What a shame that \\"the voice\\" is gone. What a gift she had (beautiful and talented) only to be destroyed by drugs. WHY!!!!  So many would have loved to have had that voice and those looks and she threw it away for a snort.
B007BLUD30|4.0|I really enjoyed this light hearted & fun movie, and it was good to see Alan Alda again even though he was the bad guy.
B005D51JQQ|5.0|Sobra decir que Sting es uno de los mejores músicos...<br />Esta recopilación es excelente...aunque hubiera disfrutado más la versión<br />estudio de Russians y la versión original de Send your love...<br />Me parece que faltó incluir la canción Let your soul be your pilot...sin embargo le doy<br />las cinco estrellas...y lo he disfrutado tanto...<br />El libro es de muy buena calidad al igual que las fotos.<br />Si eres fan de Sting no dudes en comprarlo
