B00GD7M6AG|5|This hat fit my sons big head really well. He hated it a lot less then other hats we've tried because the fit is nice and loose.
B00LBCY5H0|5|Love it...very pleased with the quality and the speed I got it in.
B008FCYSF8|4|Had to remove the elastic band in back was to tight but good now
B005HV76SQ|5|I like the tall shirts. The length is long enough for a tall person to be able to tuck in comfortably. The shipping was quick.
B0096WDNKM|5|I'm 5'7 and can wear sizes small to large in sweatshirts but after reading other comments I decided on the small and it fits great. Its soft, warm and looks just as pictured. It shipped super fast too!  I've already washed it a few times and still looks good as new.  highly recommend.
B00LL6QE7U|3|it's ok
B00EVH4VS0|3|I'd have to admit it's my fault because I tried to use it with a messenger bag and the strap must have rubbed it too much even though it was a steady 10 minute walk.<br /><br />It fit a little large for my taste, but it depends on what you like. If it wasn't for it coming apart in 7 different places after 10 minutes of use, it may have been a good shirt.  Just use it for working out without any other material on too and it should be fine, and gentle wash.
B005SICKK2|1|First the good: the design is super cute and the fabric feels nice.<br />The bad: it arrived with a big hole in the finger so I returned it. I didn't get a replacement because although it says one size fits all, the gloves were humongous and my fingers didn't fit to the end of the finger parts. Also, it looked like there were other spots that would soon be ripped. Poor quality.
B00BA07TJE|5|I was given the opportunity to review these pants as a blogger and I have to say I absolutely love them! They are the most comfortable workout pats I have ever worn. The lightweight material is very conforming to the skin and breathes very well to make even the most advanced workout more comfortable. I would love to see these in more colors to add to my wardrobe!
B00KH66DYO|4|all of them are cute!!
B004HG1EYE|5|He loves them
B004FPYLPQ|1|These are really crappy socks.  I wore them with my Halloween costume and had them on less than an hour before they sank down to my ankles.  Very disappointed with this purchase.
B00J2S401Q|2|Quality is poor compared to how it's shown in photo.
B007TWRFAA|4|These are adorable and stay on nicely. I only wish they made them in larger sizes. They lasted until my daughters were 17 months old.
B00BB06S0E|5|These undershirts are awesome. Comfy and soft. I have bought them for my husband and 3 sons and they all love them. They wash great too. A new favorite.
B007TJIZ8Y|2|Too baggy in seat/legs. I thought these were the same style I previously purchased but my son won't wear them.
B00F2VX8T2|5|Great for Halloween
B00DANSU7E|4|Love the toes on these socks but wish they were a little tighter.  I wear a size 7 and ordered the S/M but they are a little loose.
B00LERVI0Y|1|Some stitching came undone after 1 wash
B00JV80CZU|1|I need to return the dress its small and very thin
B002NPCJ5E|4|A bit small, but it is good overall.
B005SJKO7M|5|I hate hats but it's been sooo cold this year.  This hat is fun to wear and VERY warm.  I've gotten so many compliments.
B002GCHZ6M|1|This item was really poor quality.  The cufflinks were like a plastic and were chipped when they arrived.  I sent it back the same day.
B00L57JO7M|3|The top was somewhat small for the size. Other than that, it is wonderful!
B00GOMS18Q|5|Love them! I will be buying these in black very soon!
B00DRD065Q|5|Absolutely beautiful!!!This dress is amazing!
B001L0XCK8|3|The only bad thing I can say is it kind of fit a little snug to be a size 5
B008EZ5DUK|5|Super cute bows.. 2.5&#34; bow fits my 6 year old daughter perfectly. Doesn't look too big or too small! Great Quality product!
B0003YDZG4|1|This hat is really small.  Too small for my melon, to be sure.  I have a fairly big head (7 1/2) but I don't usually experience too many problems with fit when it relates to stocking caps. Received this one, pulled it out of the box, tried it on and started laughing.  Great hat for a lady or a little kid, but if you're  bloke with a good sized head, spend a couple more bucks and get a carhartt, which is what I should have done.
B00E815VV0|5|I wore these for st. Patty's day and everyone loved it! Suspenders easy to put on and bow tie was easy to adjust!
B0007CKOKM|2|Obviously cut for the serious cowhand, not for a city slicker. ..
B00Q9DUOIA|4|Great hat. Fit is a bit small
B004M5DGA0|3|The T-shirt is just as advertised and looks just like the picture! It's awesome. The material is thick. I ordered a Men's Small hoping it would fit (I'm a small 5, 2\\" female) and it does. It's big, but that's ok.    Then tin is awful, however. It's scratched and has peeling tape and labels.. it does not look new. Thank goodness I didn't get this as a gift!
B004M6XUI2|4|There is plenty of room for all the cards I carry, and two pockets for cash.  Just the type of wallet I like.  The finish seems to be soft but durable, and should hold up well for a long time.  The extra case for my driver's license is a good feature as well.  Not a great wallet, but certainly functional and well made.
B000RWF4MA|5|We are very pleased with these pajamas.  They arrived as advertised.  The are comfortable and have held up to many washings.  They have never bled red dye onto other items.  We'd buy again.
B00A9HMKEI|5|My husband had a big ole smile when I pulled this out of the box. But as suspected he said he wished that it had a chest pocket. Lol.<br /><br />It's a very nice 100% cotton and so it's comfortable. Mind did shrink very slightly when I washed it but it didn't fade at all.<br /><br />Hubby won't wear it unless it's a special occasion but I suppose that's ok. He just doesn't want to wear it out too quickly I guess.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest / unbiased opinion. All stated in this review are my own thoughts and experiences with this item!
B0002LIASG|1|I used to love Hanes stockings years ago.  This pair snagged upon removal from package everywhere it was touched.  Tried it on one leg and with more snags it then tore.
B00BC9W9QQ|4|Very pretty and soft. Colors are bright. Just wish it was a bit longer is all. Overall very satisfied with it.
B00DGX1SC2|3|Nice
B00IS080AQ|3|Fit larger in the chest than anticipated, should have ordered in a small size. They say asian sizes run very small but in this case I should have gone with my normal sizing (small).
B005441RFO|2|too small
B007BLNMK6|4|Love these shirts!  Very good quality.
B006HSD0YM|5|Like the shirt.
B00IMIAEVW|5|This arrived today and I am very pleased with my purchase, it fits beautifully and is soft and flowing. I will be ordering another in a different color.
B004COA1TA|2|too small - poor fit
B000KNCMLC|5|my husband loves these, could not ask for a better fit
B000LNE9O4|4|These are very durable shorts at a fair price. I have worn them before.
B00IGI7ISA|5|I love the shirt.
B00BG2UG9Q|4|Although my husband doesn't have cuffed dress shirts he loved the gift.  So now, we have to go shopping!  Very cool and compact.  Have yet to test the USB drive
B00UKNRQDQ|3|Product is great but does seem to stretch with use. If you are looking to waist train, you need something stronger.
B006VOV38C|5|It is so nice to wear Levis again.  The jeans are long in length but that won't be a problem because of their comfort!
B00I0J0VW0|4|The dead is the perfect length. I was a bit worried about the size but it fits good. The padding for the bust is absolutely perfect! Love the dress. I would definitely recommend it!!!
B00E0OQTAC|4|I tried this on as soon as I received it and it fit perfectly. One wash on cold and one dry on medium heat and it shrunk too much to be flattering. The collar is also stubborn. I hope I fit into it this coming summer again. haha
B0085JHW2W|5|Awesome product.  Booties that stay on an infant's feet?  Small buttons on a strap around the ankle?  GENIUS, GENIUS, GENIUS.
B00APXNC66|5|These pants are fantastic for a work environment, just make sure to double check the sixes because they do run a little bit small.
B00FWEGZLM|5|Awesome good looking shirt
B000I6M3AG|4|I find that the pants blouse out a bit more that i would like.  I am sure if I lose a bit of weight theses will turn into clown pants quickly - the front pockets really open when you sit - which allows then to catch on the arms of some chairs and rip
B00C8Q3FZ6|1|Big on top & small in trunk. haven't worn it yet
B003TFE5HW|5|awesome product! totally does the job
B00AA6KCUW|4|One size fits a little small however they will hold up nicely for cosplay. The lacy is pretty and manufactured well.
B00BQ6LPGK|5|Extremely happy with my purchase. The color was beautiful and the bathing suit was as expected. Planning on buying more!
B00EQ2U9MM|3|My daughter wears a junior's size 2 and this sweater is not big on her. Fits her fine. Keep that in mind when ordering. It is Asian-fit. Quality is so-so, but not bad for the price. She liked it.
B00OQW0ZXK|5|Just received my hat in the mail and it's perfect! So glad I ordered it! Fits great and it's really thick and warm! Great quality for the price!!
B00I1AGEJM|4|I've been looking for reasonably sturdy, reasonably priced, weekend pants for a while. These fit the bill well and are comfortable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the front pockets are small, like they saved a little by shorting the material a bit. My normal, bifold, wallet *barely* fits in the front pocket, where as with other pants there's room for the wallet and my hands.<br /><br />The second issue is with the 'cell phone pocket'. This is a feature I've been hunting far and wide, and I found quite attractive. This pocket is, though probably fine for a flip phone, not deep enough for any normal smart phone from the past year or two.<br /><br />Both of these are manageable disappointments, and I think these pants will work, but it did take some of the excitement out of getting new pants.
B00FLNAKOM|5|I looked everywhere for this hat for my husband.  It looks really good and came much quicker than they said it would.  Good job!
B00PH8Q8QU|4|I received the swimsuit today. I ordered an XL, since i am normally a size 8 or large in bottoms. The bottoms fit perfect! I was afraid it would be too small and that my hips would be pressimg through the slits on the side. But, to my surprise they were perfect! The top didnt support and busted when trying it on (but Amazons customer  service is awesome and already assisted with that.) I already have another top to match the bottoms.  By the way, Im 165lbs and 5'3, if that helps.
B003XFT4MY|5|I just can't say enough good things about Jockey.  I saw these in catalog and orderd a pair to try.  The fit me perfectly, super soft, and sexy.  I own many different thongs and these are about the best I have worn.  Cute colors, have recommended to friends.
B00LWYYD2Y|5|These socks won't leave a ring around your baby's little ankles, they are very soft, easy to put on.
B00H3QM4HQ|5|I ordered two of these and I LOVE them. Very nice, good quality tshirts. The print on the front is great. Very good quality shirts, I received two of these and one had a small hole (could've happened in shipping) the seller got back to me within 24 hours and just sent a new one, no need to return other. An absolute pleasure to do business with!
B00O7MRJR4|1|These were WAY too small. I had to ship them back!
B00I7M9PYK|1|Sizing is off. Got a large and fits as if it was a small.
B009VNFH6E|5|These pants are sooooo comfortable!!
B00F928FVA|1|Got a large and it fits like an XL. Also the ivory is see through. Guess I thought they would be thicker and less shiny with a tighter fit.
B001EVX9DE|5|Excellent !
B000M9N9R0|4|My 11yo son loved it and instead of giving it as a gift, he kept it for himself. <br />
B003KVUPR4|5|Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.
B001BXY13C|3|Not a bad hat for the very cheap price. Feels like decent quality. Nice deep black color. It's one size fits  most and is a little small on my husband average not big head. Oh well.
B000MR1A6Y|4|Let your freak flag fly man.  Long live the Dead!  This is the perfect riding accessory for my bike which is already Dead themed; I love it.<br /><br />Fits snugs and it is really one size fits all.  I have a big head (literally & figuratively!) so if this fits me, it will fit you.  Comfortable, light weight and looks good.
B004KZQR6C|5|Yes yes yes.  Just what I wanted.  Takes me back to my youth.  Definitely by at least one size up in the waist and as long as you can in the legs....
B0051U18L4|5|Excellent
B00KQ1LRFA|3|It's a lay that mask can lights at dark. I expected better one.
B00CIPJV4Q|3|This bracelet was cheap and isn't the best but is okay.
B003HC92LG|5|Received a pair of these socks as a free sample promotion. My husband who is an avid runner really seemed to like them, but I wanted to wait to purchase to see if they would wear out in the first month as many others have. It has been almost a year now and even though I've purchased more the original pair are still going strong even after several washes and daily runs. He particularly likes the elastic banding that hugs the arch of the foot. Very supportive.
B002G9UEFY|5|Fab price. Cheaper than in store.
B00AOCW7O6|4|I love this blouse..... But again, runs pretty small. I got the x-L where I'd usually wear M/L. It's a little more snug than I'd usually like, but I love the blouse-fabric, length of sleeves & style.
B005LCNK86|4|it feels very soft and fits perfect...got a lot of compliments.<br />the fabric and the details are superb. sizes are very exact and giving it's jeans like style, i wind up wearing all the time,alwyas my first choice as soon as it's washed and dried
B00MEB6Y6M|5|Love it
B0078YYLUG|4|Super cute super short  great with leggings or something under for a glow run or Halloween  go for it !
B00GB7FY48|4|I bought these on the reviews advising of men's sizing. Aren't as big as I was hoping for. Afraid of shrinkage.<br />Love the fabric and design tho.
B000LY2JFY|1|It wasn't as big as it said it was, the design wasn't the same as the pictures.
B00ACIGVJE|5|Fits good
B00DBMTQPY|2|vibrant colors! great color combination! medium weight fabric that is not see-through. looks like the pictures. however, it is doubtful that a 6 year old girl could wear this skirt. approximately 12 inch waist when elastic is fully stretched. stiff elastic that does not easily fold over on itself. way wrong sizing. such a shame as this is a beautiful skirt that looks fun to wear.
B00JN3CIU0|5|Nice solid shirt!
B00A7TEV54|5|LOVE THE FIT, SUPER COMFORTABLE!
B00PDHTUV0|5|Perfect fit, great packaging.
B0083QLQ0G|4|This is a good set of extenders considering you are receiving 3 colours. The extender fits well on my Olga bras. It is not too noticeable on your back that you are using an extender unless your shirt is extremely tight.<br /><br />This is a money-saving purchase for me since these will allow for continued to use of a few bras that would otherwise be too tight in the band (weight gain/pregnancy). Much cheaper than buying new bras.<br /><br />Given 4 stars due to the stiffness of the material that they are made of, which, since they cannot be machine washed (I think that is what the packaging indicated) it will not go away any time soon.
B00ID1Q5PW|5|the materiel doesn't seem like it'll hold up for as long as most shirts like these and the threads tend to get caught on the buttons from time to time HOWEVER as they say you get what you pay for and for what i paid it was worth it can't wait to buy more!
B00MVL95E8|3|Fit well enough but not all sizes are shaped the same.  I like it even with the fit.
B00DZPCXWA|5|I had purchased these briefs at Kohl's and knew they were extremely comfortable.  Being able to get exactly what I wanted through Amazon makes this an easy purchase.  The Briefs are cotton with light control and do not ride up.  They wash/dry easily and are a great buy.
B00KFXAP2K|1|This dress is tiny and really poorly made, I wouldn't suggest it
B00GFZOX9I|5|Good fit, good quality, and nice colours, hope to purchase more in the near future, as long as they dont get lost
B00AHAH0ZG|5|On time fit good love it
B00DEXBO9G|3|I don't recommend this to anyone over 5' 2&#34; unless you want your business shown to the world. The physical fit of the dress was great and true-to-size, but it is VERY short. I thought I might be able to wear it with tights and get away with it, but no dice. It it much too short. Still, super cute, but I did have to give it to my friend who is about Five even, and it looks charming on her.
B000VZQYZE|5|Like this item, although I had to order a size larger. I also found washing by hand was a good idea. Always satisfied with service from Amazon.
B00I4VAO0S|5|This product is awesome!
B0073E590C|4|It looks great for my husband. No issue with outfit. The mask is little large but its acceptable.  The belt needs Velcro instead of tie in the back.
B00131T0BK|4|Very comfortable tee that fits really well. The elastic on the sleeves is a little strange, but the design is very nice.
B002HWRZQ6|5|OMG, I cant tell you how happy I am with this jeans. First of all they dont even feel like jeans, they are luxuriuos, to the touch and they fit like a glove. A very satified consumer. THANKS. L
B00MX3G5MY|3|Variety of socks was great ! The quality is ok  They are comfortable quality material but there is no way a man with size 12 or 13 size foot could fit into these socks!  i have a 11.5 size foot and the socks a very snug.
B000OTTI2S|2|This item ran very small and was cheaply made.
B00J58TE2S|5|Love item.  Everyone thought it was great in my Zumba Class.
B000W18VB2|2|Just noticed this is no longer available. Figures. Expected more from VanHeusen. Fit fine, color was fine, buttons lasted but everything else wore badly in less than 2 years
B00J6FBRJI|5|I bought 5 tops for my Puerto Vallarta trip and this one is my favorite! Fits perfectly, nice and long! Pretty color fits great!
B00PNZUQDI|4|Joggers are ankle length not knee length
B00EYGE7X2|4|VERY CUTE but it runs small. If you are an XS, get a medium.
B009NUC6I2|5|I knew the sizes were going to be a bit snug as it's a juniors size hoodie, so no complaints here as far as fit goes. I absolutely love it, and I haven't had the floppy ear problem a few other reviewers have had.
B00974AZD2|1|Ordered the wrong size, could not refind the right size, so did not get to try the product.  Take care when ordering.
B00XQWYF1Y|5|Simple cotton blanket
B00P0ZKQWM|5|Great shirt.  Kiddo loves it!
B001IYFKVG|5|Excelent
B00KZY5L96|2|Not flattering, returned the dress. looked cheap for the price.
B00OZM8S8A|5|cute
B00A00DDHM|3|got it as a gift for someone, it was huge!
B00LD14BEG|5|Love this coat!
B005D7E3N0|3|Nice material, I like the side pocket. Don't like the fit so much. Legs are huge in these pants.
B001JBH16A|1|Awful.  XL is not XL. Thin and made lousy,  I hate them and will never buy Fruit of the Loom again.  I should have bought Dockers .
B00850S6EY|5|love it, just too long
B00BDV9GG4|5|I bought the shirts and they were shipped and arrived  promptly.  They fit well and are pure white,  with no imperfections that I have found yet.  I've had an opportunity to wear all the shirts. I would definitely recommend these shirts.
B007SNZPPM|5|Perfect for the child that loves Elmo.
B00QH7N06G|5|Perfect size for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She and I are very happy with this outfit. Package arrived right on time and in excellent condition. We are very pleased, thank you!!!
B00F3Y6HN2|5|Thank you! Beautiful!
B00821XNPS|5|My favorite. These are the most comfortable scrubs ever. Very soft.
B00AKP3YGC|5|Very pleased. The dress is perfect. The material is soft and the red flower makes the dress. I would like more Color choices in this dress.
B00B1GY74C|5|perfect fit
B002LSI2XQ|3|They were more snug than I expected and had only one normal sized cargo pocket. They have a smaller pocket on the other side. I ordered a size 8 when I normally where a size 5/6. Not super happy with these.
B00KG3VDZM|1|Hi how is this dress light gray it looks tan
B00KH9IWMC|5|Shipping was almost as much as the product . . That part made me sad. But it was still a good deal and perfect for the little tutu's I was making for the Grandbabies &#60;3
B00846Y7T2|5|These socks are so soft and fit really well. The fabric is high quality.  I highly recommend - wish they came in other colors and styles
B001HQLADW|3|so so
B006IJOEH2|5|Everything was fine.  It arrived on time.  Perhaps I should quit shopping on line as I'm tired of being hounded to review everything.  If I go to a store they don't follow me home and ask for a rating.  This is just too much hassle!
B00PW004WC|5|Loved it , fits great
B007VO3352|4|I'd been looking for some cute t shirts for my girl to wear. Even though it's winter, it gets quite warm in our apartment so I wanted something lighter for her. These were some of the very few cute shirts I could find, and in her size.<br /><br />My girl is 2 months old, 22 1/2 inches long and 10.7lbs and she is almost swimming in these shirts. The length is perfect, going to just below her belly button, but they are so wide and the neck hole is so big that I'm torn about letting her wear these or not.<br /><br />My girl is a bit small for her age though so that probably has something to do with it. I imagine if she was chunkier, or older at least, that these will fit better. I'll definitely hang onto them for awhile longer.
B001EVX9DE|5|Actually I use this clip as a book mark.  It holds the page down and doesn't fall out of the book.
B00JY6N81O|4|perfect size perfect color
B009AM9OKG|3|Size Medium was too small for me.  I am 5' 7&#34; and 152 lbs, and wear a size 10.  The coat was not snug; it was too small.  It was a good fit for my 5'4&#34; 107 lb daughter who wears a size 2.
B000LWJ3CI|1|Oh...My....God....    Chillblockers...They have nerve calling them that.  I live in Washington and go fishing during the winter.  Tempertures average around 32 to 40 degrees in the morning.  I head out around 6:00 am twice a week during this time.  Within 15 minutes to 30 minutes my hands are cold, not freezing, but cold (barable).  After about 2 hours of fishing my hands are now freezing.  I have not stuck my hands in the water, since they are waterproof, which might affect how warm the gloves remain, I am just standing there casting.      Now, if I need to remove the gloves to change lures, in order to avoid puncturing the gloves with a hook, then putting them back on, my hands seem to warm up a bit since they were exposed to the elements.  However, within 10 minutes or so they are back to freezing again.      It is windy sometime that makes the 'chill' worse.  The fact that the gloves have fleece seem pointless.  I think it's due to the fact that they are form fitting for dexterity so they are not bulky which would typically provide way, way, more warmth.    If you want a waterproof glove for not-so-cold weather, then these may work for you. Though I had a leak in my first pair and they had to replace them.  If you want warm toasty happy fingers, keep lookin.
B00I8RYM4C|3|Big fan of Andrew Christian. My first pair of almost naked underwear changed my life a couple years ago. I thought &#34;why haven't we been wearing this kind of underwear forever? &#34;<br />I ordered the medium based on the chart and the reviews. I'm 5'10&#34;, 175. I thought the medium was too small. Showing too much butt cleavage. Like the underwear, but I'll get large next time.
B00Q8C9UEG|5|ok
B00BXQTGGY|5|I LOVE The Mountain Tees. They are great colors and prints and last forever! This site had great prices and the shirt arrived in a timely manner. Would definitely shop here again.
B007O3T7N2|5|works/look awesome no problems,. easy to use and wing span looks amazing and sooo easy to customize. Didn't use the mask since already had one but the wings were great addition to costume.
B00DMRDECE|5|I bought this because I am a cancer patient and needed a good hat that had some style. Love this hat, looks good on, very comfortable!
B00K0DOGSY|5|Really sexy. Nice fabric
B00GQVC2XU|1|Bleck.  It is possible I will find something to wear this with, but I almost hate the muddy camo-esque color of it.  It's not at all happy or pretty.  it is NOT the green (or the purple) that is pictured.  UGLY!<br /><br />I anticipated cheap fabric (which it is, thought, light and certainly wearable).  However, I did not anticipate the cheap stitching.<br /><br />I deducted all four stars for the poor color quality.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY.
B00DH9U9TS|5|Love my new jeans! 1st time purchasing jeans online as different brands size differently. I'm 5'2&#34; with waist and hips 33&#34; and 43&#34; resp.  The size 10 fit perfectly! I had to place several darts in the waist to reduce the band by about 3 inches, but this is usual for me.  I like the funky style and that they appear well worn, though new - the way jeans are supposed to look! I would certainly be looking into purchasing other CK styles.
B0076R6L58|5|The jacket has many pockets and is soft, but it is a lint and hair magnet. It fits great, is very warm, and the price was outstanding!
B00CRW9GOA|5|got these for my teenage son.  He likes them.  They fit well.  Good value and very stylish for a teenage boy.
B00E8KD70I|1|Too small for adult male will not be using them for wedding as hoped. I was disappointed in the size.
B002QRCMTW|5|I like this belt. Its stretchable and can be adjusted according to tummy. I have lil bulging tummy and any other leather belt oes not fit me well but this belt is awesome.
B00DZKXETG|3|Very stiff.  The pic is hard to see.  Still can't tell that color behind the silver lines.  I prefer the feel of the Haggars I had.
B00144JOBM|5|I purchased 4 of these dresses in black. One extra small for my 12 yr old daughter(12/14 in girls), a small for my 14 yr old daughter (1/2 in ladies) and 2 larges for other bridal party members (8-10 in ladies). The dresses pretty much fit everyone perfectly. I am having all hemmed, but my 14yr old who is 5'5\\" and the dress falls right below the knee on her, the other ladies are shorter and the dress fell mid-calf. We were very pleased with the dresses. Quality was consistent throughout all the dresses, material a little thin, but for the cost of the dress it was acceptable. I was very pleased and everyone looks great!! Getting married October 2nd, 2010 - can't wait. I was a little nervous with all the reviews being all over the place regarding sizing, quality, etc. I recommend these dresses. Also, they came very fast!
B009FVA8RU|5|My daughter loves it
B006Q1G27W|5|as advertised
B003XSWAKE|5|Looks just like the picture, very pretty and super cute comfy sundress. Reminds me of the dresses I wore as a kid before becoming an adult and realizing they just don't make comfortable dresses for women anymore. Top is stretchy but snug enough to stay up. However, it arrived with a very strange almost chemical-like feel on the fabric, not sure how to describe it. Washed it immediately and seems fine now. Still highly recommended.
B00EYT7S6C|5|My husband says these pajamas are very comfortable and he is happy with this gift. I intentionally bought a size larger than usual because he likes the top to be plenty roomy. The material is soft and washes well. No complaints; would purchase again.
B003P2VPUY|5|Perfect bra for me... Could never find one in stores that made me feel great in them...
B00VLDK6ZE|5|My daughter loved it!
B00WTCM7U8|5|Love this top!  This is a nice medium weight, well put together, and very nice looking. I'm a size 12 and I got the Large. It fit perfectly and the material is very stretchy so I can say that it would be fine for a 14 as well.  I can wear this to work and out on the weekends, so I appreciate the versatility and possibilities of the top :)
B007EEX0BG|3|Bought this raincoat for my daughter & the blue one for my son. It does the job but the zipper catches in the little strip of material by the zipper. In having twins, I like to zip and go. With these I have to take a little more time to make sure it doesn't catch in the zipper which my daughter has done.
B0020ML3EI|3|These are nice basic socks, but compared to past pairs that I have bought they feel a little flimsy. The top especially is very thin and fits a tad loose around my ankle. I have extremely slim ankles, so these might fit better on regular size people.
B00LIS03E6|4|Purchased this coat for a trip to Washington DC in late February when the temperature ranged from the low 30's to low 40's. Overall, the coat did a great job of keeping me warm with just a thin sweater underneath. While the outer shell of the coat is not made of natural fiber, it wore well and looked very comparable to other mid-tier brands (e.g. Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, etc.). For the price, it was definitely above average and should hold up for a few trips.
B002GU7C8K|3|It`s okay
B006U9Q1AI|5|Great tie will be purchasing a few more.
B000NZW3IY|5|After missing several shifts at BK (do NOT tell my boss!) while waiting, camping really, near my P.O. box, it FINALLY arrived.  Ripping into the packaging I pulled out my SWEET, brand NEW, XXXL 3 Wolf T in black.  I could barely get to the bus stop, ride to my stop, and then walk to my d-wide fast enough.  After peeling off my old 2 wolf shirt, I put on my new threads.  I'll tell you what, when I walked into my D&D group that night, the fellas were PUMPED.  I was not just Gorgon, a level 5 druid with a seeing stone and invisibility cloak.  I was Gorgon, a level 5 druid with a seeing stone and invisibility cloak AND a 3 Wolf T.  That night I was unstoppable, winning several head to head challenges with Azim (Borofir, a Half Orc with flaming wand) and Jon (Gimlik, a Dwarf with mind control ring).  The next day I couldn't wait to head to work and show off my awesome wolf laden T.  The guys loved it, but the ladies, frankly, went [...] crazy.  Yes, they pretended to turn away in disgust, but I could tell that they really loved it.  Get one for yourself and LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!
B00A4MSBWI|5|These are by far the most comfortable pants I own. I wish I could buy 7 pairs and wear them every day of the week, that is literally how much I love them. Unfortunately there was only two left in my size! I'm 5'8 135lbs and the size large fit perfectly. The waist has a bit of room, so I'm considering trying the size medium, cuz I seriously want more of these pants.
B00MQRNXPY|5|I ordered this top to taken on vacation with me, this top is very well made and fit perfectly , while it is inexpensive it is not cheaply put together. I like that even though it is a light weight sheer fabric it is not too see through as to make one feel too exposed. This is exactly what I wanted in a cover up!
B00K6NALL4|5|Great!  Fast shipping,  and better quality than expected.  Thanks
B00AEJQAOW|3|pants were the right waist size but way too long I had to get them hemmed 6 inches lol just to wear them
B005GYL9C8|5|My wife loves It! Holds a lot and has a nifty design. Her sewing circle of hags are very jealous...
B00AMTXMZY|5|These shorts can be worn to the beach or, just around town like another shorts. You can dress them up with a nice shirt and shoes. You can even just go beach bum with them and wear them solo.  Fits the waist just right so pick your size wisely.
B00KXHNWLO|5|My baby is on the bigger side (7 months and 22 lbs), but these always fit perfectly with a little stretch room.
B0014EBRIU|5|I was extremely impressed with this product.<br /><br />This vest is very well made (as is the tie). It was shipped to us very quickly (which was important as this vest will be worn to a prom!) and was identical to the photograph, so it was the color we were looking for!<br /><br />Highly recommend this product and vendor.
B0076QV4MY|5|Shiny and expensive looking.  Very comfortable and warm.  Will be good on those cool winter mornings.
B00IA73Y7Q|1|runs small
B000JLM10W|3|This product hasn't preformed as I hoped it would.  The top has seems to peel down when it's supposed to stay against my skin.
B00MN9904I|5|Great!
B00EOIEA5U|2|not made for a baby with some chunk
B001QGT7EC|1|This wig has no center line. It is just a hot mess. Save your money.  It is not worth the low price.
B00H1BSU6C|4|excellent product looks good
B00A65Z4W8|5|I have worn this shirt to work and gotten compliments each time.  It's good quality, good fit, and long enough for long torsos and arms.  Great buy!
B00KYAAR1I|5|Very pretty
B00HY57ED0|1|came stained, trying to get stains out
B00GHGH1B2|5|I LOVE this sweatshirt. It's so soft and comfy and perfect. Definitely recommend for any BMTH fan.
B0011FPG0M|3|Jacket is very nice but too small so back it goes
B00X53XM0E|1|i don't know who this bottom fits, the ties are about 6 inches long and its really just a rectangle, i mean i definitely expected it to be cheap and awful but its worse than i could have imagined
B000VB2P06|5|Scrubs were very nice and roomy - have recently lost weight and am so used to these things running small that I was surprised at how big they were. Should have ordered a small. Quality very nice.
B00IFQVEKQ|5|Great socks!
B002EAHQ38|2|Cheap, cheap cheap. Rubber belt not well painted, looks cheap. Fabric too thin. Didn't use it.<br />Ok this is an update. I ended up using it one year later. I had to use an undergarment so it wouldn't be see through. The wig was useless so I did my own hair, and used my own white boots since it didn't come with any. The belt is still awful but it looked acceptable. In the end, it worked out and I looked great. Just be warned the only thing that is good in this costume, as long as you wear an undergarment, is the dress!
B00MCX9AVS|4|the colour is exactly as shown, the material is snug.
B00K19DNPY|5|I brought this shirt for my 2 year old. The shirt fits perfectly. I haven't washed it yet so I do not know if it will shrink but it does exactly what it is suppose to do. I will be buying more.
B00CXY31XY|5|Absolutely gorgeous gown and hat.  My granddaughter looked precious and it is MUCH nicer in person even than in the pictures.  I highly recommend this item and the seller.
B00NLZ9T7Q|4|Short for perfect but the pants are much too long. My daughter small to be her age.
B0047N10ZA|5|I bought the Dockers in black, khaki, and stone colors to wear with my uniform as a volunteer at the National World War II Museum.  They fit just right and feel good...like the soft touch.  I do tours at the museum and need to look sharp.  The Dockers always look neat but are comfortable doing it.
B005VDR1XU|5|bought this for a work coat for fall and spring, however it also works great for a under coat in mid winter also.....great jacket
B00CBESA7I|4|a bit thin in fabric but looks good and feels good
B00X3CRTAG|5|Thank you so much I was looking for a party dress for my daughters birthday and came across this vendor it goes great with her theme witch is going to be lady bug. Great quality it looks just as they show you on the picture but the only thing the shirt is not a onesie but over all I give them a five for the quality of there clothes. I will order again.
B00BFNNX2S|3|There are not of the quality of cotton I expected. There are so thin, my skin is showing thru them. I don't expect them to last as long as my other brands.
B00S7ECP7M|3|Really  confusing to figure out how to put on
B00FR8TPQ0|5|It fits nice, it's just that the zipper at the back is a lil metal so on a winter or cold weather it's really uncomfty to wear. But all in all it's okay.
B0088FT3G6|4|All cards fit proprly clip is good too leather quality is not that good but for this price its awesome Over all its good
B0009MZV76|5|Great sox.  A little pricey but my husband has a problem with fat pads on his feet and these are well made.
B00JOERT66|5|A little snug, but very well made and attractive.
B00E2PM3U4|5|I was looking for something that runs small because I am small.  I usually stay away from one-size items since they almost never fit me.  This fits me perfect, and it's great quality for the price.  It arrived within a few days of ordering as well.  I can't wait to see the look on his face when I wear it ;)
B006C9GO6C|5|awesome
B002ZGJ65W|5|Perfect
B009LHFK7Q|4|I usually wear a size 8, so I ordered a size 29, but they were too small in the waist.  I returned them for a size 30, which fit perfectly. These shorts are fitted, but roomy through the legs. Very pleased with the ease of the return process.
B00VFU05IQ|4|These shirts fit like a glove. I am a mom, just turned thirty this year, and have been looking for solid clothing staples that are simple and make me feel good about my body. I do workout and these shirts show off my figure well. I don't have to worry about parts of my bra poking through. I recommend wearing a cross-strap bra (works great with this shirt). I like the cotton polyester blend because I like my shirts to last more than a year. I can use these year-round to layer up in the fall and winter and for working out.<br /><br />The only qualms I have are the tightness of the shirt and I got sent the wrong color. I ordered two shirts: Indie Pink and Light Bronze. Instead of Light Bronze, I received Rust (one of the currently unavailable colors). Both colors look great, but I think the stock on these shirts needs updated.
B00UI4QENK|5|Love these, great price, order a size up and HANG DRY.
B00TWW2I3E|3|Good
B0002UCES4|5|soft washable breathable and best of all the velcro is on point, doesnt get loose!not bulky either. just what i need!
B00FF58MPU|3|Measured my head and ordered based on the size chart but was much too small for me.  Otherwise, nice hat.
B009UZAE7U|5|Luv it. Great fit
B00TZBQFHM|5|These are so cute, very well made, and just awesome all around! Well worth the price, for effectiveness and adorableness. The fleece backing is awesome because it really keeps moisture off the baby's chest.
B00B4SMXUW|5|Joe jeans are have some stretch and are very comfortable.  The unusual Atlantic blue/green color gets noticed and receives compliments.
B00L2SHTVM|1|returned for credit.  garment was way, way too small.  can't understand why anyone would ship this item knowing how small they are.  was very disappointed with it.
B0081HJF96|5|Got this for our son for Christmas.  Looks great on him.  It is paper thin but he insists it is really warm.
B0095FE0E8|5|Great gift!
B002XXRW58|5|This was a really nice fabric.
B00DYQFMQY|5|not good as I expect
B007YHA7UK|2|You need to have the figure of the model in the picture in order for it to fit.<br />Heaven forbid they make garments in proper sizes so we can order the size we need.
B0063JN9XM|4|They are OK for the price
B00HHSN3PW|5|Fit great!
B00VWNL9EA|3|Attractive, runs small.  Not fond of the sheer fabric.  Overpriced for the quality of fabric.
B00C2S5IL4|1|I just received just One leg warmer, what about the other?<br />in 3 days is Halloween and my costume is incomplete.<br />I pay for a complete costume. Something has to be done.
B009NRJTPS|5|I love this top it runs a little big but there is plenty of support if you are heavy chested.  My only problem is finding the perfect bottom to wear with this top.  Other than that this is a sexy corset and I can't wait to wear it to my big event next month!
B00KD79WKO|5|Fits great, fast delivery
B008X1JJ2I|3|I actually like the product. what I DON'T like is the fact that I ordered a Large and twice, was sent a medium. So beware, even though it says Large in the description, they will send a medium.
B003HC8S0C|3|Not quite what I expected.
B00856U6HI|5|I am pleased with this t-shirt. The weight of the fabric is nice and the graphics are crisp. Since other reviewers thought the shirt runs small I ordered a larger size. I got a medium 10-12 for a 7 year old. It's a little long on him but otherwise fits just fine.
B00FOU277K|3|It was a tad smaller than I had expected. I got a small for my 5'1&#34; niece and it is maxed out. She can grow one more inch max before she no longer fits, width wise she fits but she is a twig.<br /><br />It keeps falling apart. the seams are poorly done. Two of her spikes came undone, and so did the seam in the back.
B00SOY4186|5|I have switched my wardrobe to all tribal pants.  There is never a muffin top.  They are very slenderizing.  Very comfortable.
B00I2C4D0G|5|I love this suite! It is just like it was pictured . I find it to be very sexy, and it covers my stomach. I highly recommend this suite to others who are looking for a one piece because they want to hide some flaws. The swimdress is very flirty. Plus you can still get a great tan in this suite.
B00MYB7LT6|4|Only four stars because I pulled them up and a couple seems popped.
B009FBXIPE|3|We found the size to be a bit smaller than expected, but the quality of the product to be pretty decent.<br />Unfortunately it was packed sideways in a square box which left the brim in a terrible shape. Still trying to flatten it out without damaging it.
B00281ZLL2|5|High quality, reusable, they come in a nice storage packet. Easy to put on and sticky though I would imagine that you would need to re coat w glue if you wear them a lot. Cant be seen under a Clothes so they make a great little surprise.
B00L1HQMRG|5|I strongly recomend it. The dress was a perfect size and the color was awesome!
B00GNTZTZ8|5|love it!
B00NI30P42|5|This a perfect wallet  The design is attractive and the wallet fits everything that needs to fit in
B00JEYWZN8|4|I'm a 9-10 size...so I bought a 9....beautiful dress but a little tight on bust area....but very nice though!!
B00DL8BI5O|1|Very cute and soft but after we had it for just over a month (with the baby only wearing it a couple of times) the fabric pulled away from the snap. The seller does not do returns or exchanges after 30 days. Not the quality I would expect for the price.
B00RW1C3SM|2|This looked super cute in the pictures, but the dress was cut in a really weird way. Instead of having normal shoulders with seams around the arm like a t-shirt, it was almost like the dress was cut out of two pieces of fabric (front and back) and sown together. As a result, the shoulders puffed out in a weird way, and made my shoulders look rounded in an unflattering way. I don't think it would be comfortable in hot weather. Otherwise fit fine, and the blocked pattern is very fun. Maybe for someone more petite? Sent it back.
B00JA2VSDW|5|bellisima
B00RDFEQS2|5|Very good!!
B00574M7MS|5|Great socks! True to size. Have held up after washing.
B00GSQJDK8|5|They fit perfect and my girlfriend loves it!!
B00G4JNBIY|4|Beautiful dress for a little girl who loves wearing dresses. The description was correct. Love the dress.
B004OZG5V0|5|Fit got shipped fast great price
B007WA0B3C|2|So it finally got here after 3 weeks. Its very soft and silky. It fits well but the look is not what I expected. I guess it just seems like something an older women would wear. Its more detailed animal print then something I had pictured. It looks different on the picture. I guess u can where it sometimes I just have to get used to it. Otherwise its ok..
B003OQTYBI|4|Somewhat large but love the quality and looks very nice on the guys.
B001D0604Q|5|Muy bonita la Billetera, Comprenla Con Seguridad, El Estuche es Muy Resistente<br /><br />Si la piendan Regalar, es un Muy Buen Regalo<br /><br />Excelent
B00G0JDU9S|5|I love it! Fits perfect and it arrived on time.
B0058SWSJK|2|I should have ordered one size smaller than I normally wear. These run larger and I definitely don't get the &#34;seamless&#34; experience from this underwear.
B00M3O3KD0|1|REALLY CUTE SHIRT BUT RUNS SUPER SUPER SMALL!
B00LX3SS84|5|The size is right on target.  It is made well and also has a little tie belt in the back on the dress.  It's adorable.
B00D4K1VTW|5|loved
B008D94QN2|3|Lasted a year, the red looks more like pink but still a decent buy.
B003OQTS46|4|It is nice. Wish it came in black. The tan color shows dirt.
B00SA2GJRS|5|Love the shirt seems to be made of good quality and soft knit fabric. Bought it for a fathers day gift and i know hes going to be very pleased 😀
B00IGY7Q5O|5|Thank you!! We got it the day after I ordered and my husband LOVES IT!!!!! We took pictures and put it on facebook!
B00VNOW00A|3|Dress looked a lot better in the picture, but for those of us with a large chest area (I'm 34H) this dress does not flatter, but the fabric was decent, and looked beautiful, just not on me.
B00INI1FE6|5|I get so many compliments. I love it
B00CC7ERHG|2|This dress looks beautiful online and upon first glance when I opened it. I was very disappointed that the flower on the front of the dress wasn't sewn on correctly and is falling off. I'm exchanging it for the same dress and hope the second one I receive isn't falling apart...
B00BGCS35U|5|Fabulous bra!!!
B00J9QAU2Y|5|Love it!<br />Fits really well. Expected a great t shirt, got what I expected and more. A great buy! Tremendous!
B00JQPBK4U|5|Cute
B000RUJJAU|4|I got a lot of good use out of these fangs this past Halloween, and startled quite a few people when I smiled and they saw the fangs.  I have pointed canine teeth, so they wouldn't fit well there, but I used them on my incisors, &#34;Tru Blood&#34; style.  I'll tell you what, they looked really cool.<br /><br />A lot of people left comments about the adhesive mixture, how it was smelly and they couldn't stand wearing them with that stuff. To be honest, I don't think those people read the instructions on how to fit the fangs. It's not like you mix up the adhesive, smear it on the fangs and slap them on your teeth. This is something that has to be done a day in advance. Sure the stuff stinks when you mix it up, but the next day the smell is gone and you get nice tight-fitting fangs.<br /><br />The only con that I could find is that they are intended to fit teeth of all sizes. When I fit the fangs against the front of my teeth, the back side of the fangs had a large gap to the back of my teeth.  I guess that's what you get with one size fits all.
B009TM8MP0|1|I loved the look of this dress when I saw it and bought it to wear to a wedding. I was so disappointed when I got it and it looked like something that the 70's probably should have kept. The stripes looked solid in the picture but they are actually all different textures ad are weirdly interwoven. This dress is awful. I didn't even try it on when I received.I opened the box, saw the dress and said, yep, gotta return that. If you liked the 70s go for it. If you didn't don't even bother buying this dress. It is ugly, the fabric is super thick, and it's all around not a very cute piece.
B00CTJYKWY|2|I wish I would have been able to see this product before I bought it. The only redeeming feature is that it came with a lunchbox that I probably will use. The material was paper thin and will probably only last a couple of uses before it will get thrown away.
B00KF6AT9G|5|Very pretty, fit just as expected.  Comfortable, well made, and a good price.
B00HGRGW7K|5|quality
B00DC9M9LO|2|This should not be one size. I'm in the B range, and this doesn't fit well. I added a star for comfort, but this top is basically useless due to poor fit.
B004M6UDF0|5|fits in pocket nicely. Holds a good number of bills. Nice slot to store credit card and transparent slot for id.
B00849WZCU|5|This little onsie is great and got quite a few laughs and some blushed faces at the baby shower :)
B00ELJT5ZC|5|Adjustable! Totally in love with this, no need to worry about if it'll get too small or too big!
B003TJ9EYC|5|Bought it to match his Dickies work boots, great match, just what I expected.
B00GTV04SW|2|too small for size 3t
B00JDEABBM|3|Its a good sash.. more on the beige side of color, NOT WHITE!<br />and couple of rhinestones fell off as soon as I opened it.. a bit heavy on the waist-<br />I wanted it for my white wedding gown, and good thing I ordered two of them,<br />ended up not wearing it, but also couldn't return it.. so i have it in my closet.....<br />maybe on  a later occasion... not going to lie, it is great product and its Beautiful!
B007JX5GM8|5|These are great tank tops. I am 5'3&#34;, 118 lbs and a 32D. The medium fits with a little bit of room. Not tight, not too loose. I will definitely not dry them so they don't shrink. The material is thin but nice quality and they don't look like the cookie cutter ribbed tanks you can get anywhere. I'll definitely get these again when more colors are Prime eligible.
B00FB51FL2|4|I love this wallet. Everything is perfectly organized and the compartments are the right size. I'm so happy I bought this wallet. I kind of feel like a new woman. I'm much more organized, and may consider running for office or solving world peace.<br /><br />I do like this wallet so much, I'll get one for my daughter, she hates everything but loves this wallet.
B00856YNZE|5|It's great! the size is perfect finishes and appearance are given by the manufacturer. It was an excellent purchase. the recommend
B00JKY5KJ8|5|I'm 5'1 , 17 female and weigh about 130 lbs, I got a medium and when it came in the mail I was excited to wear it and It fits alright it's very loose but comfortable, I couldn't complain, honestly it's great for the early winter season, overall a great product i suggest buying if your a pete rose fan
B0006NMQDA|5|My 15yr old son loves this hat. I also like that he will wear it and keep his head warm when he is out side in 0 degree temps. So it is a win win for me and my son.
B008KBEMOQ|5|I adore this bra. I was doubtful of the shoulder straps. When I imagine the contraption that can control my boobs with the kind of exercise I do I always picture something with a clutch. Not any more! This bra did the job, and the shoulder straps are much stronger than they look. No bounce, no jiggle, and I am a 36 DDD gal who is used to wearing at least two sports bras anytime I want to do anything strenuous. These bras even come in pretty colors - hooray! I did buy a size 36 DD because I like the girls to be strapped in nice and tight. I would highly recommend this product, and will be buying more for myself in the future.
B008BHE1Q8|5|Good for Halloween!
B00CEIMGFS|5|Thank you but I would like more colors
B0007OVKHG|4|I've searched long and hard and have a collection of bad strapless bras...<br />This is the best one I've found so far and the one I use under halter or racerback tops as well as under tops where a regular bra actually would work.<br />A very comfortable everyday as well as dressy bra which eliminate shoulder strain and pain while making sure \\"the girls\\" look good.<br />It stays up,no need for embarrassing adjustments and is invisible under even paper-thin cottons and knits. Living in a hot,humid and tropical climate give this strapless a lot of use.<br />I dislike excessive padding and found this bra to be well within my comfort zone.<br />I'm still looking for the perfect strapless with features such as contour seaming on the sides for added shaping,but to my knowledge such a bra might not even exist..<br />I am a fairly critical shopper,preferring high quality materials and workmanship,but I also love bargains and a good deal and found this product to be both;good quality and a great price.<br />It came with clear straps which is a nice extra.<br />I would probably suffer through the wear of a less comfortable,\\"stiffer\\",push-up type strapless for a very special event (ball/gala/wedding) but I expect to get a lot of use out of this one and I'm actually going to purchase another in case they discontinue or change the design of this one. I got it in my regular size of 34C and sizing is perfect.<br />The only reason it gets \\"only\\" 4 stars is because it is not a (for me) 100% perfect product,although I would definitely recommend buying this product.
B009T9TJ78|5|This really is a great purchase because it has every size. I find that for shirts from places like jcrew, banana republic and h and m the smallest size fits the best. In the future, I will most likely only purchase a set of the smallest sized ones.
B00MQRK10Y|4|great price, fast response
B004F1VHT8|1|this bandana really helps me find them in a crowd so i can stay the hell away from them - perfect!
B006L8MNUA|3|It runs a little bigger than I would have liked, but still wearable. Otherwise this is a BEAUTIFUL dress!
B0078P35MA|5|Bought these for dad for Christmas, he works outside regardless of the weather. These lined pants are perfect for keeping him toasty on cold winter days!
B001I8H6LE|5|Nice scrubs.  Fits well and is sturdy and wrinkle free from the dryer.
B00LLKJHPC|2|Ran way small. Pockets and zipper-look front are weird and useless.<br />Decent enough for the $$$
B00IIJ6HAW|3|I like this product but it came with a hole along the thigh seam
B005IYRWZO|5|For the price and fit, these are my go to chino style pants.  Comfortable.  Soft fabric.  Roomy pockets.  I am not a &#34;Dockers&#34; sized person.  They look good.  Good price. Long lasting...what more do you need?
B00CBQCUUY|5|great quality and fits comfortable
B00569J5NS|5|Perfect costume for a great price! My son loved it and so did everyone that saw him. I highly recommend!
B00IXCYNPU|4|Good quality material and fit perfectly.
B00AKWBILS|1|Not a great fit<br />Have to keep pulling up<br />Too bad thoe<br />They r cute but doesn't fit right<br />Hopefully they will work for u
B0059FRP9U|4|It's more of a butterscotch color, not a light blonde. It would work if I didn't need a very specific color for my outfit. Otherwise very nice~
B00R11Q4VK|2|too big for me
B0034G65W4|5|very very nice
B00DAMYYTI|1|Both sleeves are too tight, but one is way tighter.  I measured them and one is nearly an inch smaller.  Lots of women like myself who need a XXL also need the sleeves to be in proportion to the body size.  My advice is don't order this shirt unless you have thin upper arms.
B00CIA0IP2|5|This sweater was beyond expectations.  It is very high quality and fit very well.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Will definitely buy more products.
B00331D1YA|2|It looked nice, I thought it would fit and it was just a tiny bit small. When I saw it in real life I decided it wasn't the jacket for me and did not like the way it felt on my skin. Back it went
B000UJE7AA|5|Excellent product, I love the fabric that was manufactured
B00BSEW1SG|5|This was very cute although I think a little over priced.  Looked a bit small but when I tried it on it fit fine.
B007PFOMS4|1|I wear a size 14, i ordered an xl tshirt, it is the size of a childs xl shirt. This shirt will be useless to me. Typcally xl are to fit 12/14, this does not.
B003WT0O5M|5|I've always been hesitant to buy clothing online because you really never know what you're going to get. Even with the new zooming graphics you see on most sites, until you can touch the fabric, you have no clue as to whether or not it's a quality item.    So, going on the other reviews, I bought this pair of pants and couldn't be happier. The fabric, the fit, the color, etc are all perfect. Do not hesitate to buy this if your size is available.
B00HVH25RG|1|I would not order this brand again, It was too small, I could not use it at all... It fit a friend who is medium
B00FD2OHQ8|4|I knew this was a junior size shirt so a large fits pretty good. I'm typically a medium and I prefer my shirts to be a little loose so this is a little snug but again I knew when I ordered it that it might not fit perfectly. I was pleased with the fit considering all of this.
B00J4IBKH6|5|Excellent product, fit as expected,
B0049Q76FS|5|great shirt.............got lotta nice comments
B0068MA7OS|4|It is a little big.  However, the quality is very high and it is very comfortable.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  I am also considering buying another one only a different style.
B0048FZQDO|5|Gloves were really well made and really nice.  Would recommend them to friends and family.  The colors are very bright and they are very well made.
B0006U9NXE|5|I'm a huge leg warmer freak and these are some of my favorites.  They're large enough to wear comfortably and the tassels are really cute.
B00AFTO3P4|5|These socks are perfect for what we were looking for. I ended up purchasing another 6 pairs (one package) after we received the first 6 pairs. We have laminate flooring and the socks are thick, breathable, durable and the non-skid actually works for our very mobile 18 month old. He takes corners like he's on rails. I even looked for sizes for my 3 year old. Will buy for him if I can find them. These are DEFINITELY worth the money.
B008982B8Y|5|Excellent product good afternoon, I think inremplasable is beautiful and I never tire of using it is the maximum quality, I love to have all the colors I love my jacket.
B00KT8XHW6|3|I applied a decent product.
B007NG789A|5|Lightweight and very comfortable. I bought this to wear over tanks and sleeveless dresses. Perfect for summer nights! Fit is great. I usually wear a 1X(40-42 bust) but got a 2X based on the reviews. I will be purchasing it in white also.
B00B5H9MRO|3|I still like the way they fit.  They are long enough and they fit snug.  The material feels sturdy but one of the jewels popped out of the zipper while trying it on. Will crazy glue it back in but it's only a matter of time before they all fall out.  For reference I'm 5'5\\" 125 lbs.
B00LPRY4M2|5|great
B004XM5JNO|5|Some may look alike but they don't act or feel alike.  There is no polyblend non terry crap robe that feels as luxurious as the real deal.  Those robes are itchy and non-absorbent.  This robe feels like the comfort of a friend.  It is like a warm hug and I am in love with this robe.
B00EV5Z6S6|4|Just wash it once and it will be fine!
B00N5FI4AA|4|Love the bottoms and such a good price too! Living in Hawaii bathing suits are soo $$$! Only problem for me is that I have a small upper body and larger butt! The top is just a little bigger than I would have liked.. If only they had xs available! I got white and yellow and those are a tad see thru, maybe better for a hotel stay but for $14 I can't complain!
B00973HM5C|5|It's very nice
B00NWYO55W|5|👍
B0044WWFO4|5|Great scarf. Soft,warm and stylish. This is the second one I bought. Service was fast too. Looks like it will last a long time.
B000I7OV9G|5|People used to walk past me and think UGH, now that I haven't taken this shirt off for a month they think YEEEEAAAAAAH! I am the coolest person at walmart in this shirt! I even beat that bearded dude! whooohooo!
B0018OHISE|4|fits as expected.
B00EICKUVU|5|Great suit! Fun to wear; in fact, no one knows I'm not really Deadpool! Only downside is that you can't eat tacos or chimichangas through it.
B008EQ0DAY|1|it is awful! on a photo looks excellent any rag moreover and the size came less. I am disappointed. It doesn't cost such money
B00NNKEB68|5|This is super cute and good quality. Great for rainy season and it matches with every outfit.
B002MBJKHO|5|This jacket is a staple in my house.  I believe this is the 4th one I have ordered.  Worn constantly, never seems to wear out, it is warm, soft and can be thrown in the washer and drier. Colors do not fade and they maintain their shape.  Sizable pockets in the front and the zipper works smoothly, always.  I only buy  new ones to get a different color!  Will buy again!
B00B8UEFGG|3|Este pantalón era para el colegio y cuando llego era demasiado grande
B007AMG640|5|I gambled a little bit, because I normally buy small (I'm a skinny guy), but in pajama pants, that usually equates to 'a couple of inches too short' (because I'm also a tall guy).  Went with a medium for length, the waistband is still snug enough that I don't feel like I'm in danger of losing my drawers, and they're a really nice weight for summertime sleepwear.  Basically, I got everything I was hoping to get when I bought them.
B00KOP6ZJQ|4|My daughter likes it
B001307UG8|5|Perfect for my wall display, good for those in uniform.
B0002MFPCO|3|it works fornow
B005KSV894|5|Great Catsuit for Halloween...Best Costume at the Halloween Party, earned me a $100 cash prize and free drink for myself and friends!!
B00KH4GNKU|5|So very conmfortable
B00M6QD8QO|3|sticks up off my head too much-Other than that a great hat
B008617ROC|4|Save from my son giving me the &#34;fountain shot&#34; for a couple of times.  Realistically, this is more a fun toy, as you can also block the pee from a towel
B00SVE2U0A|5|This was a gift for my great nephew who's dad has full sleeve tats...everyone says the baby looks just like his dad...well now he does...with his own full &#34;sleeves&#34;<br />My niece is thrilled! And so am I!
B00HA0SYRO|5|Very light and sheer , the perfect spring/summer scarf
B00Y85T3YW|4|Great price fits well came earlier than expected.
B00FKAAIUM|3|Although the product was nice, it certainly was not the color I ordered.  I ordered it in grey and received a purrple.
B006I9OQXE|5|I wear a medium and I don't like my clothes to fit tight so I order an xl. And I love it.
B008AHJ1NM|4|My husband likes them, fit well, good quality.
B003P0XRVG|5|I bought this coat for my 5-year-old daughter. I absolutely loved it when I saw it online, and I absolutely loved it when I saw it in person. It is beautiful. My daughter wore the coat along with the hat to a wedding a few weeks ago and she got tons of compliments on it. It is light in weight, which is perfect for our weather (we live in Alabama). She looks so adorable in it people just wanted to take pictures of her with the whole ensemble on. The coat and hat is perfect for holiday pictures! To say the least I am very pleased with the purchase.
B00KTMBSM8|5|LOVE these Curious Designs tunics, I have them in four different colors. The fabric is super soft with a beautiful drape, the colors are bright and rich, and they don't fade. I love the shape of the shirt...very feminine without being clingy. I didn't know whether I'd take a large or extra-large, so I bought both....the large is 46-47&#34; chest and 27&#34; length, the extra-large is 49&#34; chest and 29&#34; length. One caveat: the description says machine wash and I would advise against it. The fabric is delicate. If you put them in the washing machine, even on the &#34;hand washables&#34; cycle, in cold water, in a machine without an agitator, they will get little frays which eventually turn into holes.
B00EB11A6M|5|These are my favorite jeans ever. They look like expensive 80 dollar jeans. They are comfortable and stylish.
B003VVSL2E|5|I really love this bra and am buying a couple more today.  I feel very supported but also very comfortable - I hadn't realized a bra could be both! Usually I take off my bra as soon as possible, but I find myself taking naps with this one still on and I'm eager to put it on in the morning hours before I expect to see another person. It just feels like good on.<br /><br />I realize this review is a bit inane; I wish I had the words to describe how much I love this bra. All I can say is I'm so happy with the one I bought, I'm going to buy at least two more today.
B005CSOHAY|4|Perfect for the gym and hanging out. Fit was accurate and they were not too short. This was a first time buying sweatpants online and was happy with the purchase.
B000EBPAMS|4|I gave this product a 4 star and not a 5 star because the pockets are made of bathing suit mesh. For this type of item I expected at least some pockets of better material. I did not buy this item for swiming but for everyday use. I do understand the use of mesh for pockets; however, with so many pockets, I think mesh is not the way to go.<br /><br />Have received many compliments concerning the look of these shorts (I bought 3 pair and will buy again).
B00BTKX41M|5|I purchased  Kirkland signature briefs for my husband last year, for the first time. This year they were a request!  His comment...too bad these weren't around 20 years Go!  Comfort is everything g to him and he finds these very comfortable.
B00062NHDE|5|100% cotton very comfortable and color never fade..Great Buy
B00GFZP7DE|1|Coat looked like just what I wanted but when I put it on (and I always wear a medium} it didn't even come close to fitting over my sweatshirt. The worst part was that it cost me over $20 dollars to send it back. The postage is one thing but I was charged a restocking fee. Will not buy clothes through amazon again.
B00E6R0COM|5|I love the cute and cheery colors on the eye glass case. I will give this one to my friend.
B00BVBH7KS|5|Love them
B00J7KWY1M|5|My husband just loved this bolo tie.
B004JVBLSG|5|Good quality n just the thing I was looking for!!! I would purchase another pair as my baby gets older
B001PU9A9Q|5|These are great. Thinner than any other I have tried but still give coverage. So light they don't feel heavy and the adhesive is strong. Definitely happy.
B0027X168S|5|What can I say? They're boxers. They fit well. They're comfortable and durable. This was a repeat purchase, so they must be good.
B00BYBZDBU|3|The locking clamps hold on nice and tight, which is great. However, the long part of the strap that goes against your leg gradually loosens over the course of a few hours. This requires some jerry-rigging to keep in place.
B000QGBUY8|2|Not a good item .. I already opened it or I would return it...
B00Y9JH2MW|5|I love cotton shirts. this is good quality and very sweet.
B00TKIY1E4|2|the material seams are scratchy, no matter what softener I used or amount of washing.
B001E50CEO|5|I am petite (5'0, 102 lbs.) and ordered it in x-small. It fits great! The shoulders aren't too wide, the end hits my hips, and it's very feminine. I am very happy with this lab coat.
B00LX05YJS|3|Pretty cool ordered xl.still to tight..nice detail thou..
B00JRDKPY2|4|I'm 5'0, 110 lbs, and this dress is a bit baggy on me.  Would have to wear a camisole underneath as the armholes show my bra.  The material is nice and would probably resist wrinkles but since I haven't worn it out yet I do not know for sure.
B00ACIHDT6|1|The sizing chart says that Medium is 34&#34; - 36&#34;. I wear a 35&#34; so I thought these would be perfect. Nope the medium is actually 32&#34;-34&#34;.
B0024ECNTQ|4|These fit as I hoped they would! Very comfortable. I almost don't know I have them on! If I could change anything about these, it would be to make the pouch more contoured! Having said that, I bought a pair in every color that was available in my size! I will buy the rest when I see them available in large. Love 'em!
B005DDO0TG|1|I am 5'2 & 110lbs as the bag says is displayed on model... NOT ACCURATE! The top was sooo long the skirt fell just below my hips... Also the fits is very wide!  I ended up tailoring the outfit & ended up taking 12&#34; off the waist of the skirt & 8 inches from the sides of the top. Very disappointed in the sizing & shape but accessories are cute.
B002NHLGLA|3|We bought this shirt and really liked it the only thing is that it runs REALLY small so make sure you order large as we just got a refund and no exchange...
B00BFRZI04|3|Decent hat, but the stitching is off on the brim. It looks almost like it might come apart, but I'm not going to mess with the hassle of returning it. It's just to cut grass on the tractor anyhow, so a little imperfection will not bother him.
B00EM7KJZI|5|Nice quality sweater/dress.
B00D56692Y|4|I love the shirt. I wear it here and there. It fits as expected since its a youth size. So it's pretty good. And color hasn't faded yet in wash. So that's good.
B0037U2BPC|5|Not sure why this asking me about shoe sizes?  Anyway, the wallet is perfect!  I love it.
B00C2YV1VE|5|I owned the same jacket in black and liked it but I totally wore it out. I decided to order another one but in a different color. The olive green is attractive and the jacket is very warm.
B001H0FQGK|5|Can't go wrong
B001G7R0I6|5|Belt looks great.  Nobody but the wearer knows that it stretches.  I'd advise buying 2 sizes larger than needed.
B006P5SZ7Y|5|Item was exactly as described and arrived quickly.
B00EWC0G10|5|Best  queen brief ever all cotton keeps you cooler all day I have wore for years.
B001HTQ6LA|5|I love this Beret. It is light, stylish, comfortable and can be worn for warmth or just to cover your hair when you are having a bad hair day. Have bought a black color Beret too, which can be worn with any outfit. Definitely, a \\"good buy.\\"
B00BMRGL9O|5|I've been wanting to start wearing overalls again, since I enjoyed them so much as a teenager in the 90's. They come in handy for doing artwork and for bike commuting in a refreshing drizzly climate. I know Carhartt makes a quality product, and I am completely overjoyed with these! I previously tried on a men's version but just got my new pair in the mail today and it fits way better, and was like 1/4 of the price.<br /><br />I would say these overalls are true to size. I am 5'9, almost 150 lb., and usually wear size 8. That's the size overall I bought, and although it fits in a tailored manner, there's still plenty of breathing/working/wiggle room in the waist area. The men's size I tried on before was a 32 waist and it was fine, but this one is better. I like that there isn't a real fly; that eliminates about 4 thick layers of unnecessary fabric around the belly area. I will wear these for years!
B00NGIIEUG|3|Small was too big & too long on me (size 0). The color is also weird, not as pretty mauve but more of worn out pink. The material is not see through but you can see garment lines & it is not very thick in general, kind of too much give.
B00GLQ2XHU|4|Loved it!
B005GXAZ6A|5|Great product, seller, and transaction. Very pleased thank you!!😀👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
B00YHDU9WK|5|Adorable!
B00PVUP1NU|4|Very sheer, you'd definitely have to wear a tank top under it. It's super brightly colored, which I love, and fits fine, just a little short. I'm 5'8, so it could just be that it's made to fit that way. If you're any taller than that though, wouldn't recommend.
B0009MZYEQ|5|the socks fit my husband, they were not to tight in the calves. They wash up great. Will buy more. Bon
B0017IUN8I|5|I have 10 bridesmaids for my upcoming wedding October 9th, 2010.  They each ordered this dress in pink, like a baby pink.  It is SOOOO beautiful on each of them.  They came quickly for each order.  They fit well according to the measurements of each girl using the size chart that is available.  No one had to return them for a different size.  I have a train on my wedding dress and I wanted my girls to look and feel beautiful and also have a small train.  The girls love them and feel so special in them.  I would TOTALLY recommend this dress for a wedding party or for any special occasion.  Just wanted to help out anyone thinking about this dress.  I would sincerely go for it!!
B0003DKT3M|5|Finally!  Suspenders that will NEVER pop loose.  Many people do not wear a belt when they wear suspenders.  These are not for you because you must wear a belt with these.  I use them only when playing golf.  All the other suspenders I've tried eventually pop loose during my golf swing.  These will NOT come loose no matter what.  So for me they're a perfect decision.  And the reviewer who recommended reversing them to avoid being a walking advertisement for Perry was 100% correct.  They work equally well when reversed.  I'm now officially done with researching suspenders!
B008CXLJDY|4|I purchased these to cover all of my lower leg - I am 5'11&#34; and have a hard time finding clothing long enough. These are definitely long enough and I love that. The fabric is nice and soft, not itchy like other leg warmers I've tried. They do tend to creep down a little during my warm up but I just bunch them up more over my knee to begin with. Price point is a little high but for the quality I considered it worth it.
B00H9558VA|4|The gold is not too bright to be tacky against the black lace, however I'm questioning the quality of this item. Have not washed it yet but the gold threads look very delicate and may be easy to unravel if there is any little pull. Left to be seen with regular wearing. Otherwise, it's a beautiful mantilla.
B00L9VRI9U|4|thought it was something different.......I liked it though... thank you
B0055E27AC|5|I bought this last Christmas and I use it ALL the time. Its still in new condition after all the use its been through and it keeps me warm and kept its softness. Awesome and worth it!
B00M47DSDS|5|I wish it came in my size!  I love it!
B00JWSHH5C|2|Not really what I wxpected. You are better off getting the picture from google and printing it on a better quality tshirt yourself.<br />Stay away...
B00KC3DF52|5|was here fast and fit my boyfriend perfectly: )
B00GTR9LEY|3|I wanted &#34;hybrid&#34; gloves for my kids and these are the best I could find. I was kind of excited to have my kids try them out after our first snow in November 2014.  A lot of people commented on the sizes and it is confusing but after contacting the seller for advice, I ordered 2 sets of size &#34;Medium/Large&#34; and they fit my kids (ages 9 and 11) just right .<br /><br />PROS: They are good quality and keep the hands warm. These would probably be good for skiing or just walking around outside, riding in the car or to and from school BUT<br /><br />CONS:  they are NOT good for snow play (like throwing snowballs, sledding or building snowmen) because the &#34;mitten flap&#34; flips open way too easily at the wrong moment, exposing the fingers and allowing snow to get in.  There is Velcro to keep the flap open but not to keep it closed. Too bad because otherwise I like these gloves, but my kids will not wear them for playing in the snow.
B00G9CP2YM|1|They sell like a brand name but it's not.
B008SHZTOO|5|This is better than expected. I bought this as a liner for a sheer summer dress.  It gives light shaping and actually fits my ample chest (40DDD)! I am very pleased.<br /> I have used it twice. So far it has held up to washing on normal cycle and I line dry it. Does not ride up on me while walking. (Or ride down) It stays put.
B00BT0KJ88|3|Nice wallet if you don't put it in your pants pockets, it's big and makes a crinkling sound that makes it sound cheap.  That's a strange thing to say about a wallet but it sounds like there is cellophane in between the leather.  But it's still a nice wallet.
B00NNBVE6W|5|My daughter flipped out in the best of ways!
B00LFWNAKE|3|I thin it would have been great but it was just a little too snug for me.
B00GBIZTDI|4|nice sweater for the price ($12).  well made (even stitching, finished edges, etc) and studs are sewn on.<br /><br />it looks just like the photo, long length, and generous size.  I got the medium and for someone slim it might fit more like a large.<br /><br />the fabric is a thin gauzy knit, more for style than warmth.  it is somewhat sheer, so would be good as a layering piece for warmer spring and fall days.
B00A2F0ZH6|4|So far so good i bought these for my boyfriend and other than them being a little tight to put on he loves them they look great once they are on and seem that they'll last
B006T52XXM|2|While the product looks nice, it causes sweating (material doesn't breathe at all). As such, they are too hot to wear.
B00DCN2WPS|5|I love these headbands, they come in different colors, materials and patterns. 10 headbands for a great price. They have a wire in them so it is easy to get them where and how you want them. You don't have to tie them, just twist. They don't always stay in place on me very well (not too bad), but it isn't because of how they're made, it's my head shape.. I recommend to anyone who loves to add accessories, color, loves headbands/scarves...they're so fun. I wear lots of neutral colors, or solid colored shirts and these make it fun :). They go with pretty much anything plus you have a variety.
B00290F1VC|1|The handkerchiefs looked soft and sweet in the picture, but they are so stiff, even after washing you might as well use a cracker. Seriously. Not sweet at all.
B00HHOXV7Q|5|Worm, ligjt, stylish
B00K5AKI02|5|Love it<br />extremely compact
B005OMV210|5|Beautiful!!
B0058EDGEU|5|Very nice material! Its what i payed for and more. Im dressing as the joker for halloween on friday and i cant wait!:)
B00CJ3YXM2|5|I have tried a few different brands of sports bras without success. Other bras seemed unable to stop bounce and were unattractive<br /><br /> I love this bra but definitely buy a size larger. It will be a great esteem boost!
B0052T0KT0|4|You can wear this belt with any choice of pants or jeans.  It is true to size and I would order another one.
B002UP3A2S|4|This shirt fit great and the fit just right. Great buy at a great price.
B001BJT2T4|4|As others have mentioned, this tank is very long, but otherwise sizing fits as indicated
B00CDZUZRS|5|Nice belt but I should have ordered on size instead of going by other reviewers suggestion to go 1-2 size up; its not necessary as the belt I received was sized correctly per my order (which is 1 size bigger than I should have ordered). The zippered section is only the 13in length that starts about 2.5 inches after the buckle pivot/hinge (so its not the complete length of the belt but that is not what I expected anyway - its a good finish but a little tacky from the coating still). The two snap rivets allowed me to change out the belt clasp to another buckle when I want to change appearance.
B00AYVBUKY|5|I absolutely fell in love with this hat.  However, I may have a &#34;Barry Bonds&#34; head which caused this hat not to fit properly.  I now will never find the pot of gold.  They are all still after my lucky charms.
B00E3EKBQM|3|Not the correct size! Way to small/ had to have mislabeled
B00B17OY9Y|5|Cotton and spandex blend is a nice combo for sleep/lounge wear. Not tight, just stretchy. I have a 34\\" inseam and these are a great length for me; nothing goofier than pajama bottoms that are too short. Elastic ankles; THANK YOU, NAUTICA. More colors, please.
B000N8RXWC|5|uno de los mejores pantalones cortos de trabajo, sumamente c&oacute;modos, fuertes, duraderos y de muy alta calidad excelentes para cualquier cosa hasta para salir a molestar de vez en cuando.
B000DZA4KI|4|This hat is warm and comfortable,it's a hat. The brim is good for keeping snow off your neck if you wear it backwards.  Fast shipping and good price made this one a winner
B00N3213RG|5|Cute!!!
B00OY6KVS2|4|The fit of this dress is somewhat generous, however it is pretty true to a size 16W.  The dresses material is of a good quality.
B0047UV95Y|5|Thinkgeek....no finer place in the vers to fech yourself a Firefly T-shirt. They know their shiny. Each item is of the upmost quality. Even makes Jayne happy, and that ain\\"t easy ta do....
B00FT9Z3IG|5|We got a ton of compliments on our S****er's Full t-shirt.  Fit as expected, very happy with purchase.  Would recommend.
B002ATSGPK|3|I was expecting a regular khaki colored pant. On the contrary I got a grrenish khaki colored pant, so, it's just OK.
B007IRM204|5|My XLT husband had a brand he purchased for years, but it is no longer available.  Dockers T-shirts will now be our new forever shirts.  They are soft, not heavy, not too thin.  Launder nicely.
B003BRQXM8|4|The hat is comfortable and warm. It has held up<br />well in the woods. Being crushable, you can't<br />really shape the brim the way I would have in the<br />rear of the brim. I would have liked it turned up<br />in the rear brim. All in all I like it.<br />Would have gotten 5 stars if it had come in individual<br />hat sizes instead of just small, medium, large and x-large.<br />But that would have made it tough to keep down the cost.<br />Worth the money. I haven't warn it in the rain yet so I<br />can't speak to that challenge.<br />I wear a 7 1/4-7 3/8 hat size and bought the large.<br />It is just a little big on me but very comfortable.
B00AER95ZU|5|It's a pretty standard hat, fits normally.
B009IAETUA|5|For the price, I was a little wary of the condition, but I was pleasantly surprised to see just how full and silky the wig that I received was!
B0056ZAQYY|4|I ordered the ear warmer for my 12 year old who refuses to wear a hat because he doesn't want to mess up his hair. He loves it. It is adjustable and it really keeps his ear warm when he waits for his school bus early morning.
B003BR9PL4|2|Size is probably for 0-9 adult won't fit over that
B00ESUDWHQ|5|Color and jumpsuit look exactly as pictured. Length is perfect for me! Will recomend it to my friend. She loves this kind of jumpsuit, too.
B009T9TJ78|5|If you've ever heard the saying, \\"There's plenty of fish in the sea\\" then good for you. It's an old saying, we've all heard it. Get off of your high horse. That being said, Shark Teeth metal collar stays are bad-ass.<br />  Before I purchased Shark Teeth collar stays, I was a nobody. And nobody cared. My collars used to flip up all wildly nilly, at weird angles, at weird times. Nobody took me seriously.<br />  I tried adding dark mascara to my eyes and dying my hair black to get people to stop laughing at me, but it didn't work. I tried being more assertive, not taking any BS from anyone, and standing my ground. That didn't work either. Maybe I shouldn't have started that one with a cop that apparently is scared of clowns, or anyone wearing make-up. I spent 48 hours in jail. None of the other inmates would play cards with me.<br />  I didn't know what else to do. I wasn't getting any of the ladies. Even prisoners ignored me. I was depressed and sad. I tried eating workout drinks to bulk up and look tough and manly, but all the protein just made me gassy. I was at a loss for what to do.<br />  Finally one day I noticed myself in the mirror. I looked past my red eyes, and the mascara streaming down my face. I looked deeper. All the way down to my neck. And that's when I saw the renegade shirt collar. It was terrible. I knew immediately I had to fix it. I jumped on Amazon and ordered the Shark Teeth collar stays.<br />  As soon as they arrived, I put them into my shirt collar. The smooth metal felt cool in my hands. They slid into my collar effortlessly. I checked the mirror. My collar was perfect. I was in control. I immediately noticed how bad my makeup looked with a perfect collar. I washed my face, and I went out.<br />  As soon as I hit the sidewalk and started walking, a taxi pulled up. A woman jumped out of the car. \\"You look amazing!\\" She said. \\"You're collar is perfect!\\"<br />\\"I know.\\" I said back. Now we're married. I didn't make it to the first stop light before a man ran out of a shop and stopped me.<br />\\"Your collar is amazing!\\" He said.<br />\\"I know.\\" I replied. He hired me on the spot. Now I'm the general manager for his shop.<br />If you want a job, and you want to get women, then you need to get Shark Teeth collar stays. But not makeup. That didn't help me at all.
B007X49ZP2|5|I'm very happy with these shirts-they're comfortable, wash nicely and the tails are long enough to provide full coverage when bending over.
B00DS4RYCC|5|It is very warm. My 11 year old son thinks it is cozy. He really likes it. It fits him perfectly. It is a great coat
B00GBJGSF0|5|I love it! It's adorable and fluffy and warm! So worth it
B00FKNPG7Y|3|Cute and fits well, be sure to have a tank or camisole for underneath as its low cut in front
B007XD6PVU|4|Very nice perfect fit I wear small or medium only complaint is it has a horrible odor to it I have to wash it first
B008H4DQBQ|5|Perfect for NY Winters.
B00EKH4W4E|4|Could have taken a size smaller but I like them
B00K4VF7GC|4|The belt is great I just ordered a size too big.
B005CSNVS8|4|A little long, however it's OK.
B00JRKEKDM|5|comfortable and great fit! I generally wear a size 4 - 6.
B00JDTILAU|5|Great, comfy sweats and they look nice...love that they have pockets!
B00QIYBJSY|4|Tight across the bust. I also didn't like the feel of the fabric. Did like the style but will return it.
B00M4D4Z2U|5|Not too cool and not too hot!  Perfect!
B00EAZA4M0|3|If your a small person this will look great if you larger itt will make you feel like you are larger.  Somewhat like a moo moo style.  The colors and die are beautiful.
B00GJASUL6|3|Not my favorite
B00KCXQBQ2|5|I love this swimsuit cover. It's the perfect length and fit
B00T5V8R7S|3|Took too long to arrive but was cute. Came in wrong size and color but the size fit better
B00K8LX120|5|It was perfect.  My grandson looked so handsome in it!
B00AFJTUEI|4|Cool shirt, especially for us Matrix heads. I ordered my normal size, but the fit is a bit snug, but I intend on keeping it. I think it's worth it.
B0018OZEK8|1|Verified That the Levi waist was 2&#34; smaller then advertised. Why? The customer is just supposed to &#34;know&#34; this fact?
B009KYIMVQ|4|It's beautiful but too small. Large is more like a smaller medium. Sleeves are long enough and I have long arms, but very narrow. Go up a size or two.
B0096KVL4Y|2|The blouse was too small in the hips
B001JT3P9E|2|Just wearing these around the house has brought them close to being worn out.
B002HEX1F8|5|These pants are great! Very comfortable, durable material, great look for casual wear. The pants are cut a little long though; I normally wear a 36&#34; inseam but the 34&#34; inseam works fine. I got mine on clearing at Kohl's for $10 and having used them for a few months now, I'm definitely willing to pay much more than that to get more pairs in different colors.
B00NU8UBNU|1|The skirt came and while its adorable and well made it is way too small! It fit my friend who is 14/16 perfectly. Very disappointing.
B007MRQDQ4|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. He is a huge Avengers fan and he loved it!
B00TJXN61E|5|My son is very happy with these. They are super comfortable for him, and they come clean easily so far.
B0087C5UIU|5|Not much to say, they fit perfect, feel great, and are pretty durable.
B00FLTF65E|4|I found this product to be just as I had anticipated and the service was excellent! I would definitely recommend these capris.
B00PKHIB3Q|5|These socks have a lot more knit detail in person which I really like.The color in person is more vibrant and blue than it appears online which is another pleasant surprise.
B00J9WIMX2|5|Fast delivery and quality fabric the design is printed well on the shirt very happy with the shirt.
B0085K34BO|5|The bra is very comfortable.  I love the way it fits and the price is exceptional.  I would recommend this bra to anyone.  You will love it
B009PN6FRA|4|I was looking for a nice soft, warm and lint free scarf for my husband and this scarf had it all. He seems to like it very much. I didn't give it a 5 star only b/c he hasn't had it very long and I still can't tell if it'll develope any fuzzies but so far a very good purchase at very reasonable price.
B00AKBXP24|5|I liked the socks but did have to stretch them at the top before wearing. They do look cute with my shoes.
B0041DBDEE|5|I love my shoes they look GREAT exactly as seen in the picture, color and everything, very comfortable and airy. highly recommended
B00FZRSQQI|5|Super cute swimsuit made of good material.
B002FOQHR4|5|The sweater was just as expected, nice soft feel to the yarn, nice del V for Spring/Fall wear, and the cost was modest.  We'll be ordering from WoolOvers again.
B004G09IGM|4|simple ones, nothing fancy about, didnt try it yet with sports , but fits perfect, though no mesh inside which i wondered why  ! ....will see how it reacts with moister
B00JQW63WW|5|My son loves theseI  They are a step up from the mesh shorts of lesser kids brands.  A staple in our house year round in FL!
B000P55S98|5|I love these.  Not too long and very soft.  Wash well.  Don't ride up.
B00DSRN9YG|3|They are ok for the price<br />They are comfortable.
B00C00AF6W|3|Nice Bow Tie, but CLIP is very fragile and doesnt have a GOOD enough HOLD.  Was afraid to apply pressure in case it snapped off
B005U87096|5|Good-bye itchy, bulky, or binding sweaters.  I will be able to enjoy future cool days in style and comfort in these fantastic wool tunic tops.  They are light, stretchy, generous in length, and perfect for layering; in short, my dream sweaters.<br /><br />If you want the tunic to fit snugly (look at the sleeve on the model), then order your regular size.  Otherwise try ordering one size up.
B00E006410|5|Represent with this great T-shirt. The fit was perfect. Good qualirt for a low price.
B003UYUZH6|5|The quality is pretty good. It has a foam insert where the forehead would be to keep the mask off of the face. It also has an adjustable strap, they must have read the reviews and added it. I haven't had this for long but I really like it so far. It doesn't fit my face totally but I am about 6'8\\" so if you are smaller than me this mask will probably fit your face just fine. I have noticed that the seams on one of the straps is coming undone. I haven't used it much so I'm a bit perplexed. I'm not sure if it came that way or what. Hopefully I won't have to do any sowing.
B00P08XL94|5|Love thee gloves. The perfect accessory to a very cold office. I can type and answer the phone wearing these gloves. I do wish the material was a bit thicker.
B00R824Y50|3|I thought the wallet would have a little bit more of a construction to it.  The design is perhaps too simple for me.
B00PUY9WJQ|5|These pants are great, soft and good quality. They do shrink considerably upon first wash!
B009L6IRLS|5|ok
B0036FD9DG|5|T-shirt exactly as ordered with quick delivery.  &#34;The Mountain&#34; t-shirts are of good quality and beautifully designed. I have several different t-shirts designed by &#34;The Mountain&#34; because they are long lasting.
B00K5VXG1O|5|My son got this shirt on his 7th birthday ,He is a huge minecraft fan and loves it.Don't always trust reviews as I read some critic review that says it fits small ,size is not ok and will shrink after wash so I ordered one size bigger but nothing was true after wash the color,print and size all are as good as new .
B00FYWOPT6|5|These are very comfortable and flattering. They do stretch out a little as the day wears on and I really like the color. It is a great neutral.
B00BFRSRDY|4|This looks great for casual or semi-formal summer occasions.  I recommend ordering in the next larger size, but I like a loose fit.  The price was very nice, and the style looks great.
B006VMROZU|2|These pants are very light in weight and quality, there is no way to adjust the waist. We work hard and long days, these scrub pants are just not durable enough. Even in the \\"tall\\" section they are still not long enough for me.
B00K1BDE56|5|Soft and cute
B006WITP1E|5|This is a beautiful blouse. I love the way it looks with my jeans or white pants. This blouse is a must have!!!
B007CEHM0S|5|This Blazer fitted like a glove.  Exactly to size and the cut was great.  It is of great quality with a very nice finish.  Incredibly affordable as well.
B00EU64452|5|Great fit, semi warm, but then again I bought it for weight lifting not running,  feels amazing,  now I know how girls in yoga pants feel.
B00I0XXRIQ|5|Liked it but had to give it away!
B00MOT5SB6|5|Loved the look of this dress. Fit was great! Wore to a formal wedding
B0018SUBJI|5|Fits my slender boy better than any other jean on the market. Levi's quality just can't be beat. I wish they made 501's for kids. I have been buying Levi's since 1981!
B00IH6WYSU|5|Runs small; order a size up.
B00EZRY7RG|5|Very cute! My little 5 year old Ninja Turtle fan loves his new gloves and hat and will actually keep them on.;)
B009T9TJDW|5|Great item in varying sizes to make your collar appearance crisp and neat. It really is a great price for all the stays they provide.
B00DY1FD2M|5|they fit my daughter. she wore them. you should buy them. i really don't like being forced to write a review just because my child wanted a pair of knee high socks to wear in a play.
B00F3U6FGK|5|This is my favorite Sweater to wear!
B00LMKEFD0|5|as pictured, look great and fit great
B004ARZKJA|5|Great product
B00J041AM4|5|Great quality. Much better than expected for the price
B004KSOYCI|5|I got this shirt as a gift for my husband.  The Eat, Sleep, Fish theme was the same one that I had given him when we got engaged years ago.  I was glad to see this and it took both of us back to simpler time in our lives.  Thanks so much for the memories...love the man; love the shirt!
B0081TULQK|3|i returned it it was to big, the material was very nice,
B0014K27WE|5|I love these pants, they are so light, soft, and comfortable. They look very flattering. They are long on me but I'm a 5'2 so that's expected.
B000KK2O5Y|2|Very thick and rough material. Did not soften up after a wash.  Can't recommen as something to attempt to sleep in. I wouldn't really want to work out in these either - too thick and hot.<br />Inexpensive and not quite worth the cost.  Goodwill gets a donation
B0046BRKHA|5|I gave a couple of these robes as gifts to my kids, and they are thrilled with them. They are very plush and comfortable. My daughter (age 12) practically lives in hers during the cold weather.  For the price, you can't go wrong. Highly recommended.<br /><br />FYI on sizing: my daughter is five feet, and the women's S/M was just right. Long enough to keep her warm, but not so long that it is touching the floor. My son is 5-9 and slim, and he's wearing the men's Large/XL. Roomier seems to be better when it comes to robes like this.
B008H54Y4S|3|Great price. Bib material is stiff and rough. Not sure I like it at all. Hoping it will soften up with washings.
B006W4UPQW|5|I purchased this for my little 4 year old super hero and he loves it.  I would recommend to others
B00BGIQPSG|1|This case easily pops on and off the kindle fire hd 7&#34; tablet. It does not fit snug. My 3 year old can remove it. I didn't read the description well enough to realize that it also does not have a cover. It looks like it was made for a different tablet, almost, with spots for controls on the kindle that don't exist.<br /><br />Returned the product and searching for something else.
B001KYH74W|4|These are not amazing. But for the price, you can't beat it.
B004X7TVUQ|3|Nice comfortable shirt, except top button broke off right when I put it on...
B00AF4CN7O|5|Beautiful and Wow what a deal!!! Fast fast deliver.
B004Z30NKU|5|perfect
B00CLV8FDU|5|I bought this for my wife, because she loves purple and our dachshund Brinkley. She loves it.
B0088MDL4O|5|Its cool
B002ECK80O|3|Was not as sturdy as I thought it would be.  Other than that, it's ok. It is leather. It will work for awhile.
B00BXZEC6Y|5|If you are on the chubbier side, long line is a great way to go! These type of bras get rid of back fat rolls or at least hide them! The only problem I ran into was that the under wiring under my boobs were flipping up. Take out the boning in the front and it fits fine then! I'm so glad I could wear sexy bras with an I cup! At 38I(US), I am so happy to have finally found cute bras!
B0065MUP48|5|My granddaughter loved the nightgown. She said she felt like a princess init.
B00SKPXO1E|5|Great fit, but the pink is a bit more vibrant than shown in the photos.
B00QMEUJ0Y|2|This jacket looked and felt as expected I was happy with that. However, it simply smells awful. I can hardly describe it, somewhere between<br />diesel fumes and dead skunk. I'm not sure if attempting to air it out would help or not. It was just to over powering to make the effort. I would like to believe that not ALL of these jackets have the same problem but who knows. I would have kept the jacket and happily worn it if it had not had this problem. Too bad.
B000RFYZJA|1|I just tried mine on. The little plastic buckle will not hold. The part of the buckle that is supposed to lock is nothing but a folded piece of plastic which is supposed to act like a spring and lock into the mating piece. The mating piece is so poorly made that it just doesn't lock. A money belt that will not lock aroud the waist isn't really a money belt at all. One star is an over rating. Buy this one only if you want to carry your money belt in your pocket.
B00LM9MOOI|4|shirt is a little stiff, good fit, nice cut for a woman, its a little shorter than I normally like but very cute indeed!
B004YKSCX4|5|Cute dress!  This is the second one I have bought from this brand.  The top has padding in it so no see-thru and helps keep the shape up top.  The fabric is a bit thin but the dress will be perfect for the beach or a night out!
B007V6R8JC|4|It looked more sheer in the pic. Was hoping it would look like that on my wife but it fits her and she can wear it to work.
B007BLNJFY|5|Worked great for my waiter job. Short sleeves allow everyone free admission to the gun show. Definitely improved tips.
B00TQ6JPV4|5|What great PJ's! They are so soft and better quality than I expected!! The pockets are a nice touch. My daughter loves to be like mommy and asks for them at night!!
B001OWFLCK|5|Couldn't be more pleased with how well made this tie is for the money. Won't hesitate to purchase additional ones.
B00KCX266G|5|Cute.
B00IN8XDC8|5|Good
B006V76FUU|2|don't like the material either.
B00FXLJLH4|2|These pants are adorable to look at, but as soon as they're touched the studs fall off! Very disappointed.  We lost one stud right out of the package and two more as soon as they were put on.  Cheaply made.
B0035DG9WC|5|No reason to give anything less than a 5. I mean, it's underwear. The only reason I said they were somewhat large is because my son has always been skinny and most items that are his size are a little big. But he likes them because they have the Pixar characters, and they should last us a while since he can grow into them. Would definitely buy again since the price was so reasonable.
B00B1VB6Z0|2|These fit much larger than any medium I've ever bought. They are longer than I'd like boxer briefs to be, a few inches above my knees... I'm slightly disappointed. Don't expect the colors shown in the photo either, which was one of the reasons I picked this pack.
B00H94VVA8|5|Loved the shirt. Arrived on time.
B002DUVY64|5|Look and fit great!!!!!!
B00AXGXZXU|5|This wig was well worth it. They are much better than Party City wigs. Love it.
B007G0TXDC|5|Bought it for good price, was delivered on time and packaging was perfect. Good quality Fruit of the Loom Women's 6 Pack Cotton Low Rise Bikini Panties, Assorted 7.
B00FBD2G0I|5|Just As Promised
B004K3YTG4|5|This costume is PERFECT. I'm 5'6&#34;, 145 lbs and I ordered the large. It fit wonderfully, and was flattering in all of the right places. It's very skin tight and very sexy without showing too much skin. Only open part is your chest, but it looks good. It hugs curves beautifully. The tail was longer than I thought, which I'm actually happy with because it's bendable and it gives you more room to bend it any direction you want. I didn't find any problems with the neck piece at all. One problem I have with the costume is the belt. It was way too big, which is unfortunate. I'll see if I can work magic to make it fit right. If not, I might suggest just getting another belt. Another negative is that it seems that this is a very popular costume this year -- I've already seen multiple girls wearing it. But the key is to make it your own, and that's what I plan on doing. Add intense makeup, different accessories, whatever, so that you stand out from everyone else, if you care about that anyway. Also, I bought some sexy, chic, over-the-knee faux leather heeled boot to wear with it. Adds so much more to the costume. I can't wait to wear it at the Halloween party I'm hosting!
B0007USPJG|5|I love this wallet, after having my purse stolen I now keep all my credit cards and drivers license on my person at all times. This is the perfect size for me, this is my second one.
B00FAX6GXW|2|Don't know how it fits as I was unable to even have my granddaughter try it on because there was a large piece of clear packing tape on the dress. The dress label/size tag had been taped to the outside left shoulder of the dress over the sequins. When I tried to gently loosen the tape, the sequins were coming off of the dress because the sequins were totally stuck to the tape.  I returned the dress the same day it arrived. I did not want to damage this dress by removing the tape.
B001U2V5VU|4|I like this body suit
B00IFQVA4Q|4|love the socks just a little small and I bought the larges and have average size feet
B00O1M9J50|5|I love this pair of pants one of my new favorites I am definitely going to order more in various colors the material is strong, and very comfortable !! 10/10
B0087EJ0CK|4|It fits really well, but it is a lot sheerer than I expected, can't wear it as a bra under thin shirts.  Somehow missed that in the title, but it is still really comfortable and can wear it around the house.
B0072QWOYA|5|This tank top is very comfortable. This fabric is VERY light; which is just right for the hot, sticky weather of the gulf coast.
B00CC6ZOX8|5|Great quality, great value. I am really happy with the quality, style and fit. I will be buying more of this brand!
B00BGJA3II|5|Nice shorts for the money, plus they look great. It's getting harder and harder just to find a nice pair of shorts to wear to the gym and these do it just fine!<br /><br />You will not be disappointed
B00JC2UZ6G|5|This dress fits me like a glove.  I usually wear a size 10, but when I saw the video of the model I saw that it was a tad loose, so I decided to try an 8.  It fits just a bit tight on the chest area, but fits super nice.  The fabric is rather thick, so I would recommend to wear this dress in cooler weather.  Loving Taylor dresses!
B001SERWPS|5|A very cool shirt
B003PV8FI0|5|Great!
B0045MA4SC|5|This one came in good condition and worked well. wish it would have came with some kind of instruction for it. I had to figure out how  work it, It's pretty cool!! Not sure if it can be washed
B009VKT1LE|5|I wore this today and its very fashionable and soft. I was expecting this to be a deeper richer red but its kinda just a little darker than fire engine red. Not a problem at all just a side note.
B008YD96KA|4|the band is a little small but other than that it's ok. it does amazing things for my breasts, and I'm a 34DD so to find something for su pport is very hard. the lace is a little itchy, but I'm hoping after a few washings it won't be so bad.
B00HR0EKVQ|4|Organic! Keep making organic socks and I'll keep buying them.  These are great and in a lot of colors, too!!!
B004DTS52Y|4|I think this is a nice vest and if money is not an object then you'll keep it. After thinking about it I decided a vest I wouldn't wear very often wasn't worth keeping at this price.
B00JBVYU4Q|3|good
B000YVUZDW|4|This item was discounted to single digits or close to it when I purchased it. I've had it for a few months and the color is still holding up and it's very comfortable. It feels good when I wear it, a very light and soft garment.  It was a great bargain deal!  I'm not sure where they got the color \\"Army\\" from, because I'm in the Army and couldn't figure that one out. But why squabble when the price is right. I think I might get another one in a different color.
B001PTGB2Q|5|The best - worth every penny.
B00F929IGG|4|I like these, but they could have been a little warmer
B001CVHU9K|5|I absolutely love this lingerie....I don't think I'll be shopping at Victoria Secrets any more.
B00FPP59VA|5|LOVE Hue tights! They're sized well for taller folks so they last longer as I'm not stretching holes into them. Plus- the blue is really dark and pretty
B00TC549YC|2|Beautiful dress. Quality of the dress was so-so. I returned it. Fast refund. It fit as expected.
B007O18G22|5|It was great!!! The fit was perfect!! I got a lot of compliments on it!!!
B00QSFGKTG|5|Good quality. Fit is as expected. Recommend.
B0098P5CQA|5|Ordered this for my granddaughter and it looked too cute on her.
B000T9KGKG|1|This product is very hard to apply , impossible to remove air bubbles.  It does not even cover the the whole screen ! When I finally had it positioned with most of the air bubbles removed , the little applicator tabs that are used to position iy on to the camera would not release !  SAVE YOUR MONEY !
B000BNZBAK|5|I loved this item. It was perfect for what I needed and it arrived super fast. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
B0017VX6FC|5|just had breast reduction surgery and have tried many bras. This bra by far is the best, great support, comfort, and price. I had to use a size smaller, not sure if its the actual bra, or that it is from surgery. I highly recommend this bra post surgical. its great!
B00ET4W3X0|5|This vest is a go-to with every outfit for my baby. It's to-die-for cute.
B00J16TMWQ|5|Good quality materials. Lots of compliments from people.
B007R1Z942|4|The bathing suit fit as expected. The only thing that threw me off about the suit was the net material underneath.
B011O38I3W|5|I love the dress, it was just to small for me.  I am a 20/22 and normally a XXL will fit. This dress just runs really small. All of my cloths that are not a numbered size are XXL and they are plenty big. BUT the dress is beautiful and I love it in the other colors that it comes in as well.
B00ENZ63O0|4|I don't see why so many people have complained about the sizes, that just means as a female you went by your bra size and not an actual measurement. Not to mention 90 percent of the female population doesn't actually know their true bra size. You cannot measure your own because it requires your arms and hands to be down. This means you complained about the sizing but you obviously did not follow the size chart as directed or you thought you knew your size but you didn't. I ordered a Medium seeing as I am directly between a small and a medium and it fits wonderfully. Another complain I see often is you don't get completely flat. First off men have pecks for the most part you do NOT want to be flat. When I see that on people I can immediately know they are trying to pass and don't actually pass in fact. SO I am happy I am not completely flat with this on its comfortable for the most part too. You should not wear this for more than 8 to 10 hours at a time, if you are a first timer you could panic so I would say only 6 hours. Never sleep with it on but other than that its perfect.<br /><br />I only gave this a 4 out of 5 stars because the hooks aren't best placed on the garment.
B00G25EUL2|5|i personally would like it a little larger but it fits me perfectly, the material is soft and it came really fast i was surprised,.
B00MYJZUR8|5|Great
B003FST5UK|3|The shirt fits fine, but it isn't the best quality shirt. After a couple washes the colors did fade but my son still loves it so I can't complain too much.
B00ED3W5YO|4|I gave this shirt as a gift and the recipient has enjoyed wearing it.
B000KYOL4C|5|My grandson was scheduled for open heart surgery & these pj's looked promising, especially with the little buttoned front.  I ordered several different pair from this seller & was very pleased with each set! I asked for their help in re-doing the initial order as I found some additional sets & they very kindly showed me how to cancel then re-order the larger quantity & thereby got free shipping.  Excellent seller & would surely re-order another time!  (By the way, surgery is over & he's doing beautifully...and the pj's were great from the beginning...with all the tubes & lines, it was perfect to get him in & out of clothes & for doctors to do all the checks).
B00B5W832Y|4|I like the cut of these jeans and the fabric weight works for warm weather wear. The regular length is about an inch too long on my 5'5&#34; frame so I had to take them up a bit. With the exception of the length, they fit perfectly when I first put them on, but they stretched out a bit after a few hours of wear. They do not shrink after washing and don't fade a lot like some black jeans. I will order another pair in a different color and a size 6 short to see if they work better for me. Very comfortable jeans.
B002208B8O|2|This product is the nylon version of the head caps. It doesn't really work well with long hair, as it's hard to keep your hair in. The wig that you put on with it (If it is a high grade wig) slips because the material doesn't hold to the slick material of the nylon. Great if you have short hair and maybe a regular costume grade wig?<br />Would rather have the mesh version.
B00E8F8NPM|5|This bra is very cute.  It is comfortable and wide enough under the arms to hold the sides since I have implants.
B00AF91YL0|4|Cute bra. Way more comfortable than any of my other nursing bras and has great coverage and easy accessibility. I'm considering buying another and it has only been a month!
B00CH4WLWC|5|I like this shirt and plan to wear it to Universal Studios Florida. I like roomy shirts so I ordered a large but it fits like a medium.
B003PD0G30|5|Bouth this for my grandchildren to give Papa as a gift...He loved it.. Proud to wear his Papa shirt.  Washes great...Color is great.
B0037523SW|1|I was searching for a gold scarf to wear with a particular shirt.  The picture on line was a perfect match, but when I got it in, it was yellow.  This scarf should be labeled \\"canary yellow\\".  It is not soft at all, but made of scratchy material.  As the other review stated the price is not worth sending it back, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Again, the colors are not even close to the on line display.
B006LHMVMQ|5|The product is very good.  The size is fit for me. I love it. I may buy more later. thank you
B00AZ7FY2C|5|I have been a dancer my whole life- an instructor for 9 years. Highly recommended. One of my favorite leos. Very sleek. Great quality. Great fit. Pretty, low back. Love it!
B003BVJ3OE|4|Beautifully made for the price. I was a bit disappointed to see it did not come with the stockings though.
B00AOMYMJO|5|I bought these for my somewhat slim 16 year old son. They washed and fit so well that I bought a second pair!
B007I7XPT6|5|A few years ago a great friend of mine advised me that she wore Jockey brand undies, and the reason she told me so was<br />both of us are highly allergic to elastic.  Jockey does not allow the elastic to come into contact with your skin!  How<br />wonderful can news be?  I didn't know they manufactured ladies wear and I couldn't find any undies with the elastic encased.<br />Bingo!  I am on my second set now.  The first ones didn't wear out...I lost weight and they never did.  When I went to purchase them I couldn't remember where I had gotten them, so I did a Jockey search on Amazon and there they were!  I love<br />them and they arrived promptly and packaged so very nicely.  Anyone would love them I'm sure.
B008H54UCE|4|We got this through Amazon for substantial savings verses Any Mountain sporting. Just for fun, we did the Amazon price check and WOW! Big savings, so we bought it. Kids grow so fast that we didn't want to spend a fortune for ski gear. My son likes it.
B00JX3VJ9G|2|Fabric is light and perfect for warm weather. The colors are bright . The event fit was too small.
B00CKN7Q2A|5|I love my shirt very much, fit well. And a very beautful as well. Thank u every body for AMAZON. And From the compamy, I order my shirt from. They a wonder job, sending by mail.  To rate of every thing said &#34;100&#34; percent. From Melissa A Carter😉😄😉
B00EM5Q3NC|2|I purchased these Bermuda's wore them for the first time Sat. 6/28/14 zipper broke would like to return/exchange them, and cannot...very displeased.....
B00BPXITUO|5|Great product.  Good quality onesie for a great price.  I will continue to order these in other sizes.  ! !
B005CSOHDG|4|They fit quite large on you.  Someone who thinks they are large should get medium.  Otherwise very comfortable. If you put them in the wash they do lose a little softness.
B00AO1E4I4|5|nice
B004N8P41A|5|I bought this for my sister in law who loves fairies, but not the silly little ones, the ones that have deeper souls.  So this was perfect for her! The colors of the image stood out strong on the t-shirt, and I absolutely love the image!  The faces in the roots add a bit of whimsy to it, and you wonder what she is thinking in the starlight.  The fabric of the t-shirt is thick and should last a long time. One thing to note is these are man/unisex t-shirts, so size accordingly.
B004YMATH4|5|Perfect
B000QWBQGY|2|My friend told me to order the \\"Squeem\\" because it would help my back, as I have back pain from being a hairdresser for years. I am skinny, 5'8 and 110 lbs. The Squeem is meant to make fat women look thinner. It squishes my organs and makes me look like I have a creepy tiny waist. Even if you're fat, I think this apparatus is unhealthy to wear.
B00ATIGZ4I|5|This is one of the most versatile pieces of clothing I own.  It warms my neck, keeps my head warm, holds back my hair, and keeps the sun off my head:)  It is a very thin merino wool, which makes it perfect no matter the season.  Wool is an under utilized fabric!  And it is beautiful to boot!  I have since purchased 1 other Wool Buff, and plan on expanding my collection of them!  You will not regret this purchase.
B00HUS1IXI|5|Great summer hat
B001PO6L1C|3|This corset is very pretty, but not very comfortable. I am 5'2\\" and my measurements are: bust 38\\", waist 26\\",  hips 34\\", weight 130 pounds.  I like a corset that extends over my hip bones, and this one is too short - it rides just above the hip bones, so it doesn't accent your hour glass shape very well, unless you are thinner than I am.  I prefer corsets that have a little spandex in them, and this one does not so it is not very comfortable for more than a couple of hours - of course, that's plenty of time sometimes :).
B00N1IEUAY|4|Feels like a headband.
B008YWF84O|5|Nice, quality product
B00DRDMC6M|5|I love these pants. I wasn't sure if they would fit because I am usually a size 7 in womens and didn't think an extra small would fit at all but for the price I took a leap and the fit great! they are a little long for me cause I am kinda shot but just tuck it into the boots and you are fine. These are great for my Harly Quin costume and they aren't tight or really even that hot. I provided pictures and you can link to the corset, hair, and bang gun from this review.<br />Gun-http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GJXW4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00<br />hair-http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2EBL2Y?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00<br />corset-http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K7YRBPG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00
B002496PFE|1|They were too large and the size didn't match what was listed in the size chart
B00MV8NKTM|5|Fun summer skirt for more dressy occasions.  I love the color and design of this fun skirt.  The length is perfect!
B007AAUR7Y|5|truly sexy. These gloves have been jaw droppingly fun in crowds. They make a stir whenever I wear them! Gorgeous
B00V2PZS2W|5|Love it!  True to size!
B00LDH5SP6|5|love it.. great look and feel..!!
B00JS6FS0Y|5|Adorable hat. Fits my daughter perfectly. Great quality and it's super warm. It's the first hat that my daughter actually keeps on!!! I ordered one in the next size up so I don't have to search again next year.
B009TCFMO4|5|I bought these to wear with boots for both the practical aspect of added warmth and the less practical of added style. The length is about perfect for boots that fall between your mid-calf and knee. They do provide added warmth and didn't over crowd my calves (if your boots are already snug on your calf these are not a good idea). I found them to be warm but breathable.  My only warning is that the grey color is arguably not so grey. When next to other grey clothes I own they look brown-ish. When next to black though they do still look good.
B0067FKCQ4|1|I have had this wallet for less than 60 days, It is carried inside a bag so wear and tear is minimal. The zipper began catching the first couple of weeks and now is missing teeth. Too expensive to be this disposable. I love the design very much and purchased some to give as gifts. I won't give something of this poor quality as a gift.
B000JWLP30|5|I've owned this hat for 5 years and use it at the beach and on a boat.  It's light, packable, gives lots of sun protection, looks good and is washable.   It's also held up well after 5 summers of heavy use.  Sometimes is is worth paying a premium price and this is one of those times.
B00Q2P8U0Y|4|Fit as expected but the snaps in the back are hard to close on your own.  I had to fasten it before puting it on and then place it over my head.  That being sad, it is well made.  The pads are not removable, which was unexpected.  I went up a size, as I have learned with this designer, is necessary for me.  I normally wear a 38 D and I ordered a 40DD.
B006JYFY34|4|Purchased this for my sister, she loved it.  Color is good, but the pile was a bit short, and not a great texture
B005OFM2K2|2|These are a decent pair of boxers but to be honest, they are the last ones i wear. They seem to ride up when i wear them and it makes it a bit uncomfortable. It's unfortunate because they feel soft and very sturdy. I'll wear them around the house when i just want to wear boxers or wear them to bed but that's about it
B00U8HYSNA|5|I really like it
B00F0CT00O|3|This shirt was obviously made for someone in high school with zero hips.  I desperately wanted to like it, because it is just my style and is hella cute.  But I looked like a old lumpy sausage in it, and I am only 26.
B00FMMW1OE|5|I Enjoyed wearing these
B00EMG3WGC|5|these are adorable gowns...
B001QCOVVU|4|When I purchased this item I was informed that shipping would take a few weeks, but I got it within a week or so. It's my first tye dye clothing. The color is pretty on my caramel skin tone. It is very comfy and flowy in a sexy way.
B00H7UGGKO|5|This beanie is the illest one I have!!!
B007IW0Q7A|4|this product i like and it keep my money safe . i like the wallet . it was unbreakable. good
B009BKWE9U|2|I own a number of mid to high end handbags that I rarely use.  They are beautiful on the outside, but most have a large vacuous space on the inside where contents quickly become jumbled and messy.  Changing styles to match the outfit of the day is frustrating and time consuming and not a task I relish taking on when trying to get out the door in the morning.  I purchased the Kilofly Purse Insert Organizer to make organization and content transfers easier.  The unit has several pockets which work well for small items (e.g. lip gloss, trial size hand cream) but is cumbersome when trying to fit larger items.  It's okay in my larger purses but is too bulky for some of my smaller handbags and the outside pockets are not accessible.  The unit is cheaply made (outer binding poorly stitched or not stitched at all... certainly not something I would want peeking out of my lovely Louis Vuitton).  Guess you get what you pay for.
B00DCTDEEK|5|True size. The Color is just like picture, good material. I am 5.4&#34; and 108 pounds, ordered size xsmall and was perfect
B00A9VKULO|5|These night pants were a gift given to me. They are super soft, warm and comfortable. Love them! Nice colors too.
B00465F5G4|5|really into the red orange and yellow look right now. this shirt looks really cool with the Volcom Annihilator Boardshort [[ASIN:B004GUSUXE Volcom Men's Dusty Annihilator Swimwear]]
B000V748KA|3|I wrinkles easily and since I bought white, it is very sheer. Cute design though!
B00DHEI3IC|5|She loved it
B00KFVR0TS|5|Looks pretty as I saw it
B00TK55JAC|5|Well made and looks great. Wonderful product for the price. Don't hesitate to buy. These are brightly colored, put together well and seem to really hold up well.
B00MQRBNAG|2|Does not look like the picture.. If I had known that It was a cheap product from China I would not have gotten it. It was very very see through and the under layer is about the length of my waist.. And when I tried to return it, the seller wouldn't accept my request. Definitely not pleased
B00DLCRBRO|2|These look cute when you first put them on - but they are NOT for yoga.  The material is super cheap and so thin it's almost shiny.  It is not for yoga - they held in all the heat and became quite itchy.  I would never wear these to yoga again.  I suppose I will keep them to bum around the house in.  I wish I had returned them.
B004MPEKEG|4|Great hit for child party.
B00X6SPUJ4|5|I'm loving this oversized tee! Looks cute w leggings, and it's very soft! Fast shipping!
B00JAQ1054|4|It was great! It came as ordered, and was what I expected.
B00KGEJRKE|4|color nice...fits well
B00HFHQZMI|5|FITS GREAT AND IS THICK AND COMFY JUST LIKE A REAL HOODIE SHOULD FIT AND LOVE THE LOGO I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS
B0057YB846|5|Love this costume. So warm surprisingly and not cheaply made at all. Boot covers were a really nice touch as well
B00E3UZQ2K|3|Ok don't get me wrong,the size was perfect.. and I took a small,however the turquoise colour one I bought along with the white,it came as GREEN... not even light,it's like grass green.... why are they giving you colours that aren't the same as online?.. the white was good...but there are people purchasing things that aren't what they really bought.
B003H2MRXG|1|These were horrible.They didn't look anything like the package.I didn't end up wearing them.They were a waist of money. I will never buy them again
B00KAF0YD8|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!<br />The design printed on this shirt was created and copyrighted by me for use by my company LavaLamp Creative. This seller is using a ripped low quality version of my design to create apparel without my consent. Please do not buy, as it is sure to be an extremely low quality product.
B0090H9FVO|5|Good quality, beautiful design, fits perfectly well. Doesn't smell as it is polyester and my feet feel comfortable. Thinking about another 6 pack :)
B00A0XGDBM|5|Great shirt fits well.
B00KCLZ6Y2|2|We received the product on time..my only complaint is that there are no instructions on how to glue the mustache on.  We ended up taking tape and rolled it so it was sticky on both side.  I would probably not buy this product again because of the hassle we had with it.
B00FAN4B2U|5|I love, love, love this dress. It's fairly modest with a sexy little v in the back. (If you need to be super modest, just wear a black cardigan - and if you have long hair like me, you can hardly tell).<br /><br />It's every so slightly small for the size - I'm 5'6&#34;, 160lbs, (most of it in the butt/thigh area!) and a size 10 just a little more snug than I'd like. But I think a size 12 would be too large - maybe I just need to lay off the cookies. ;)
B0081OWW3A|3|Fit a little large but was sex and soft.
B00KNB7WL6|4|Color is a bit different
B001MU6R7W|1|I bought this ballet dress for my 3 year old. It is very cute and fits great, but very poor quality. Upon receiving the dress my daughter put it on immediately. By the end of the day the seems in the armpits an at the waist where the skirt connects all split open and now there are holes. Super weird. I will be returning this item.
B001L960FS|4|The only problem is I ordered a large and they're like a size too big ... I'm a 36 and could have gotten a medium ... but feel nice, look nice (a bit big) ... I recommend them
B009FEN856|4|It is light weight nice sweater.  I purchased a small size.  It fits but I wanted to have a little lose one, so I am replacing with a medium size one.
B007IVPLJY|4|loved the style but in my line of work I can't wear shoes with holes in them. I seemly need a full covered shoe
B0027VT6DW|3|Returned
B00S4DGJYG|4|I read the reviews and bought an xxxl for<br />My boyfriend who usually wears a large. It fits him really well except in the arms. It's a little too short. For the price I thought the material<br />Was going to suck but it's actually really soft!
B00DTDJEWK|1|They look very nice but  definitely not a one size fits all unless you are a very petite around 100lbs
B005PY7UOA|5|They are as is it appears in the photo they remain perfect, though I am not who I use them but estan very well
B001EPZOUQ|4|this is another product that I bought for the halloween party!   I recommend it and hope it's available again , and here is why  It blends in with skin color easily, which give a realistic gory looking.   I've provided my picture, it is somewhat looked different compare to the advertise one's.   again, I gave only 4 stars because it's somewhat expensive compare to local store that I later found out that the local stores were selling them, too.  Another reason is that they don't provide blood and facial adhesive.
B00UTG9SNA|5|Thanks for the replacement. It fits great!!
B007BZ4O1S|5|Super adorable and perfect for little baby boys. A great set for picture perfect babies, and to keep forever as a baby souvenir. Great quality so can also be good for hand me downs later on.
B00DNVIXES|4|Cute dress fits perfect! Have to be a little careful with the zipper because its a little sturdy but, other than that it fits like a dream. :)
B0007YY8H0|2|I really wanted to like this bra as it is very pretty.  However, it was extremely scratchy and irritated my skin in several places.  I did not like the cone look! I felt I looked ridiculous. I am big busted so this bra will probably work for those who are smaller.  It's just not for me.
B00E6A1U18|5|This item came quickly.  It appears to be very well made.  It's exactly what I needed after a shower and for putting on my makeup in the morning.  Perfect!
B00EOLEQDI|4|I love this shirt and get compliments every time I wear it.<br />It does not say Wikileaks on it anywhere.
B00E3BDPC2|5|Very warm and well made!
B00BCK0VNI|5|this dress is great. it's flowy it's comfortable and it fit perfectly. the only thing that you should be aware of is that if you wear it with a petticoat to get the the poofy swing look make sure it's not a windy day. you might end up flashing people.
B006L3V612|4|They mostly stay where they're supposed to be. And they're pretty comfy. Just not worth the price.
B0087F44OS|5|Nice
B00AKFPOZQ|4|It arrived before than expected. It was for my best friends birthday, she absolutely adored it. Its a great quality, the design in perfect. Only draw back is that the button was damaged.
B00KN0NJM8|1|I was eagerly anticipating getting this tie and looked forward to wearing it. However, upon opening it I was let down tremendously. At its widest point it is hardly the width of three fingers. I'm a big guy and if I were to wear this it would look like I was trying to wear a shoe string!
B00H9YWGUC|5|The value for these two-piece sets are great. This dress looked adorable on my baby! The tights fit perfect and worked well to accompany other outfits when the weather warranted. Definitely recommend anything Carters!
B00JKTGI5I|5|great
B000A2KCMY|4|I had to reorder these because they first pair was a little tight in the waste. But I think it was wishful thinking on my part and not the maker. The fabric is pretty heavy and double thick where it counts. They need to be broken in and washed a time or two to be really comfortable. Good fit in the legs and stride for me. Can't beat it for the money.
B00NGX9U18|5|Love my skirt. After I bought my first one I got them different colors (nude, leopard print, dark red, blue, black and brown) they are great for the office with a blazer or with a tang top and saddles at a bbq. Dress them up in pumps or dress them down in sandles. 👍🏼 great investment for my closet. I am a curvy regular XL and found the L to fit better but it all depends on how you like the fit.
B003JH8SSW|2|It's a wig that you buy at any halloween store. It sheds a lot, doesn't fit all that well, and looks awkward and cheap. If I had seen it in a store and had seen what the wig itself looked like, I wouldn't have bought it.
B00OIIAM7Q|5|It's great !
B00OH8A4GG|5|Thanks
B000VD7K7W|1|seem to be Carhartt quality besides the zippers on the legs.  It is a smaller zipper than past Carhartts I have owned.  The right leg keeps separating.
B00A3XRAEI|5|This product was delivered on time. It fits as expected.
B002LHVTCS|3|A couple of months ago I purchased this exact same dress in hot pink for a friends bday party, so I was super excited when I found it in black. It is cute and shows off curves well but unlike my little pink dress it is pretty much see-through.  It worked for me bc we were in a dark club with no direct lights shining on me but if you're going to wear it to a well lit event, it may not be what you're looking for.
B003AR7QUM|5|Holds the girls well!
B00D17AH3O|2|I have ordered successfully from this company before, and I know some of their items sizing has been updated (like this one).  However, this dress was WAY too small.  I'm 5'6, size 10 and ordered an XL.  I had to laugh when I opened the package.  It ended up going to my daughter - she's six!
B004PVUE8S|4|Fit as expected
B001JBNDLM|5|FOL is the brand that fits me the best. I recently bought Hanes, same size and they were much too tight.
B00IOMTNWW|4|love it!
B00RWG619E|4|As described.
B001J1T9D8|5|The fit is a little baggy, but over all the product is great!
B00VSHICUY|4|I liked wallet. It was for my friend and it was the same like in the picture.
B0067LQX6G|5|My wife likes it and I believe I like it even better. And it is soft to the skin which is a plus.
B00M1MPF0K|1|NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!! Genluan .<br />there merchandise is not as advertised. Flimsy, too small, ill-fitted, cheap, see-thru fabric. IT LOOKS A HOT MESS. E<br />AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE ALL ITEMS BY THIS SELLER IMMEDIAELY!!!!
B00BSUENNQ|2|The buttons were so loose that one came off the first (and only) time I wore it.  All of them were barely sewn on.  I don't want to pay for clothing & then have to immediately tighten about 10 buttons.  I sent it back.  Also the whole blouse didn't seem to be very high quality
B0089SX70U|5|Love it!
B003DKT1JK|5|Everything was just fine. I didn't expect much since it was so cheap (in cost) but the quality was actually pretty good.
B00KL55WYS|2|I have tried 3 times to get this swim suit returned and get me a new one, I need it in a LARGE!!
B00HK50EQI|2|Tight
B00GD4THDI|4|I purchased this for a relative for Christmas and he loves it; since its navy it catches lint quickly but feels soft.
B00GYEQQXG|4|I have to say that I do like the hoodie, but I was a little disappointed with its thickness. It is so thin that you can see straight through it, so I will not be able to wear it when the temperature is lower (I live in TN and I believe it is about to be spring time). It is also a little on the smaller side. I have a halo hoodie that is an X-L and it is a bit baggy so when I looked at the size chart I thought maybe go for the XXL. It seems I made the correct decision because this hoodie is only a little baggy on me now. Overall I have to say that I love it for the designs(which is why the 4 stars), but it could be a bit thicker(like the ed hardy leopard print, which is also a nice hoodie).
B002TW57PK|5|It's what I expected
B009T9OY46|1|The support band began to unravel and fall apart the first time I wore it.  After two wearings, it's a complete mess and I am going to have to throw it out.  Don't waste your money, this product is really poor quality.
B002R0F7D6|5|Daughter loves it. Wants to wear it everyday. Color as pictured. Well made. Extra material lined in front. Good buy.
B0047N0NBW|4|These are nice looking casual trousers with an expandable waist. An expandable waist wasn't my primary concern but this was the closest I could find to a good fitting pair of pants. The waist was a bit looser than I expected even without it expanding. You won't need to pop a button on these after a very large meal to keep them from squeezing you.<br /><br />My only criticism is that inches are inches. Over the past few decades, women's dress sizes have shifted so women can claim to wear smaller sizes. But you can't really change the size of an inch. We live in a society where there's no problem at all finding pants with a 47 inch waist at any WalMart or Target, but a person with a 28 inch waist will find exactly zero pairs of pants at every store. If these are expandable, why not make the unexpanded size more honest, make pants where a 30 inch waist will be snug (but expandable) on a person with a 30 inch waist instead of needing a belt to keep them from slipping off, and make pants with a 28 inch waist that will fit a person with a 30+ inch waist when expanded anyway?
B00B9FOF0Q|4|These feel good but are a bit small.
B003015GJ6|1|I got it for my dad for a birthday present and it was WAY TO SMALL. no where close to what a XX-Large should be. I was embarrassing. Not recommended.
B00FGCU5O8|5|They are durable so far, but we don't use them a lot. My four-year-old does not think she needs them but they could do the job if she let me put them on. Somewhat hard to get on and off but the clips are big so that helps to open them easier. I like having them for my infant and she does not seem to mind them.
B003757TL8|5|always wanted a pair
B00CZEN8VC|5|Very comfortable skirt.  Good quality material
B00CRZDRVK|5|fit perfectly, very nice jacket
B005XLTGRE|5|I absolutely love these. I'm 5'9&#34; with an athletic build. I'm typically a size 8 in pants, but with a size 4 or 6 waist, and the small fits me so well! I was a little surprised that the small fit, but they're not sheer at all (except in the knee, if you bend it completely, but that doesn't matter too much!) and extremely comfortable! They're not the warmest of the bunch and they bunch a little at the ankles, but I love them. Having that high, wide waistband is also absolutely wonderful!
B00A02FG3Y|1|This item arrived way past its estimated arrival date.  When it finally came, the scarf is nothing like the picture.  There are no bands of pink, blue or green in the scarf.  Instead, it is an ugly melange of fall colors, and it is scratchy!  No one recovering from chemo will want this wrapped around their tender bald scalp.  Don't waste your time or money on this item.  Very dissatisfied and will be returning.
B00LVQK67E|1|looks and feels cheap. going to return it.
B0017RWBLQ|3|Hat is fine for my purpose as part of a costume. However, there is absolutely no way to adjust the size. I had to use a clip in the back. .. good thing it was only a costume.
B00NL4TRME|5|Comfortable good fit I have a tendency of tearing tights and did not do that my boyfriend loves them no complaints
B00NXYOINA|1|I don't like it. The color goes on my cloth
B00I8UTMW6|5|Looks great can't wait till Easter color is lil different than pic shows but still beautiful dress daughter loves it
B00AAUXCA0|5|The dress fits very well, and is a beautiful color.  The fabric is substantial enough that it falls with ease, without clinging unattractively.
B00CD66YOK|2|This was giant, I returned it because I would have had to have a knot the size of an orange to wrap around my waist.
B009GFRJYU|5|Hi,<br />  I was really impressed with the great colors, and it is a little big, but very comfortable.  I like the fabric, as I have other shirts from this designer, and enjoy them all.  To be honest, the shirts I have from your company, last longer and keep their color much better than other companies I have dealt with.  Go Mountain Shirts!!<br />Thanks again,<br />Don Spear
B00K5NADNG|5|Love it. Sexy and comfy. In the winter layer unless you want to be running around with headlights. Fits as expected. I'm 32-a or 32-b, and an extra small is perfect.
B00IRZ8JS0|2|The material is so thin and cheap. The stitching was coming undone and strings were hanging all around the seams when I took it out of the package! I like the loose fit, just is a really cheaply made jacket and doesn't provide any warmth, cute for spring though once you trim off all of the loose strings!
B000XY9X4C|5|Bought as a gift and they loved it!
B00EUUMT5K|3|I would buy this if I knew what size it was but I can't find where the size is listed.
B00NA7618U|5|Bought these for my librarian daughter, very cute. She wears them often and are her favorite. She has big feet and these fit her great. They are adorable and exactly as pictured (yes the two socks look different, love that)
B005HJ18YQ|5|I knew this tie was inlaid with cinnamon, but I didn't realize it was going to smell so lovely! The little swirls are actual slices of cinnamon stick and they offer up an amazing scent. If you don't like cinnamon, don't buy this, that smell isn't likely to go away. I consider it a bonus, though!<br />This tie does work VERY well for tying off a sarong. All you have to do is pull the ends of your sarong through the holes. You can tie a knot once you do that for extra security, but for basic covering up I don't think it would really be needed. Definitely consider buying one of these if you buy a sarong, or even if you already have one. It's super cute and handy.
B005KSJASA|5|Perfect for rainy weather and also works as a good wind breaker.  I love the lining inside its so soft and comfortable
B00H7SWBZA|1|Didn't like it. Send it back. Color wasn't as pictured.
B000SAMWP8|5|Love them! Great sytle, look expensive, works perfectly, always get compliments!  Came sooner than expected.
B005PQO9L0|4|Love it except the Velcro tabs :( I had to safety pin the dress or it didn't stay closed.
B00J5H8ZOM|5|cute and comfortable
B0044R7SHI|5|Lightweight, holds everything that I like to carry and dries out quickly if gets wet..  best wallet I've owned so far
B00JM7ODW8|5|Perfect! I'm 4'11 100lbs & ordered the red one in small. It's SO comfortable. I was really worried that it would be poor quality or not fit right after reading the reviews but it was so beautiful! I got a lot of compliments while wearing it. Thank you so much! I love it! Will be ordering more from this seller. Honestly I was so impressed I had to write them a thank you e-mail. It also arrived SUPER fast.  I'm new to amazon shopping and I've already been let down from 2 previous orders on a pair of shoes and hair extentions but this dress was probably my smartest buy.
B007C2PZOK|5|i love it thank you very much
B00FBD2G1M|3|Fit well, good price.  If you are expecting the cushiony Hane's socks that you usually find in the stores, though, you will be disappointed.  These are relatively thin, and I don't expect them to last more than a year or so.  Still, at this price, that's probably okay.
B00VV5GOOE|4|Great!
B0012LVWQW|5|This product is great, I love the pants, they hold up in the wash and have been put to the test by an active 6 year old.
B00I5CPJHO|3|It looks well-made and the price was right. But the fit is form-fitting snug and it's a tad long (hitting the hips and therefore not too flattering). I returned it.
B00FJQJDYY|3|My wife loves the pants, doesnt like the shirt,  a little expensive , the material is not the best, but isnt too bad,
B00CXMFC74|2|This dress is more fitted and way shorter than pictured!  I had hoped this was going to be my go to summer dress, unfortunately it wasn't! Back it went!
B00PK8P8YK|5|Bought a Tan and Black one for myself.  I'm a gall who carries LV, Gucci, Marc Jacobs bags. I appreciate quality and craftsmanship.  I hate bulky wallets; HUSKK card sleeves are perfect. I like the quality leather and simplicity design.
B00F4O2L8Q|4|Was first supprised how fast shippment came back , and the hooded robe was  a big asset for my list for christmas , which is also my birtheday . thank you
B00857QBS0|3|The quality and design was good but it was much too small.
B001EI3AAO|1|The parts for this clock are very cheap there is no real metal and the wood is fake. For the price you pay for it, it is not worth it. There is no fine craftsmanship to this clock.
B0071R3CZU|5|Not too much I can say about the hat. Simple and plain is what I wanted and got. It's adjustable, so of course it fits. It matched the pants I recently bought, so that's a plus. I plan to order more.
B009JYF92W|5|My dad loves pocket tees. He loves the muted shades of color offered. Great buy, great price!! He wears a XXL, and the fit was fine. No shrinkage noticed when washing and drying. Low maintenance and I will buy them again!
B007VUOU76|5|Excellent value. The robe is long, very absorbent, and feels quite luxurious. It's perfect for drying off after a shower while enjoying a cup of coffee. Even the service exceeded my expectations. Great purchase.
B001DRZC3Y|5|The sweat pants are very soft & heavy weighted - I consider these his \\"nice\\" pair of sweat pants!
B007IJXBZM|4|These are great pants.  A little wide at the bottom, because I prefer a very straight leg, but very comfortable and nice fit, true to size..
B007H0WGNA|5|We have at least a dozen pairs of the Leveret PJs for my twins. And as they grow, I always order the next size up. They are so soft, really cute, and don't cover their feet, which I prefer - easier for walking around the the house (and not slipping) once we're all up and moving around. I also LOVE that these PJs are not treated with fire retardant chemicals. They seem to be well made, too - I've never had one unravel, or tear, or anything else that could indicate a manufacturing problem. Of course, the kids are growing like weeds right now, so they grow into a new size every few months.<br />Another reviewer pointed out that the inside of the decal on the shirts can be a little scratchy. I have noticed that they're rougher than the striped sets with no decal, but it hasn't seemed to bother the kids at all. So I order the decorated ones... but I also have all the sets that are plain stripes, with no design.<br />Bottom line, though, is that these are great PJs for a great price, and I recommend these to all the other parents I know.
B006VFVVSS|4|Great Print
B00J226V0K|5|Great for daily purpose
B00631VM0W|5|Victorian is what I love! And this is so right! I love it! I started out to get flannel but then I saw this and instantly changed my<br />mind and I'm glad I did..This would be a perfect gift!
B00F4WL10W|5|It is very nice and fits very good! Love it and I will wear it often...<br />Thank you for the quick handling,<br />Else
B005DIF40U|5|Great fit and price was right.  My brother has wide shoulders and long arms, and this shirt was the right length.  Snap fronts are matching pearlized color which are unusual and attractive. Will buy in other colors.
B007HKPALU|4|Thank all was as expected
B00W32NQAY|5|Love the dress and came on Time.  I am very pleased
B003ZNXZIS|5|My husband loves these for tennis.
B0018OQW9A|5|Seems a little too heavy for a pair of jeans but I love the texture and the double color .... just right pair of jeans in my collection.
B00DD7ZMQO|3|too long and kinda small for me. for reference I am 5'3&#34; 150 lbs 36/30/42 and the small is too small. I think my next one is to try the medium, but I will definitely need to alter it on the bottom because it's at least 4 inches too long. Overall a really cute dress and not see through material.
B000JHAY96|5|Just in time for frigid cold, very insulated, great fit!
B0024YXG10|5|My husband carries his wallet in his front pocket and only carries a few cards.  We always have a hard time finding just a plain wallet for this purpose.  Many have hard hooks inside or a magnet hook on the back.  This was exactly what he wanted.  I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on this wallet but It is high quality leather.  My only complaint is that the numbers of his credit card are starting to get worn into the leather and you can almost make out the numbers by looking on the outside of the wallet.  Otherwise, a high quality wallet that met all my and my husband's expectations.
B00L8SV10Q|5|The 4 fit but was too tight in the bust so I had to go up a size.
B0081PFBI2|5|I'm very pleased with my new earrings.  They are simple yet elegant.  And I got them at a great price!!!
B003XNMKE0|4|I used this product in extreme heat and it was great. It was over 100 working on a runway in sun. Uses a lot of water, I had a heavy seal-able plastic bag to soak in and kept that close to re-soak once an hour, was great. Not so great if it's humid out. recommend if you get overheated or have a history of heat injuries.
B00EA4PS7M|5|I bought three different types of this make and I love everyone of them. The fit is perfect for me.
B00E32B078|5|Very nice shirt, colors were very vivid. It went well for his party theme
B00BPDFVOG|1|looks cheap and super thin fabric. Poorly made. bottom is so small! barely covers ur butt! im very disappointed in my purchase
B001KWR9YC|2|I was excited to try these, but was disappointed. I felt exposed when I wore one, and it popped off my pants within 5 minutes! My husband looked at them to make sure I wasn't using them wrong, and he said I wasn't. It really is quite simple, so I'm not sure why they won't stay on my pants. Maybe I'm not big enough yet? I am 20+ weeks pregnant and looking for a way to wear my pre-pregnancy pants without them being buttoned, but this isn't something I can wear out of the house. I ordered a bella band instead, because I'm hoping the greater coverage will make them more secure. This is really just something to connect the button and button hole, with a small amount of fabric to cover your exposed area. If your shirt rode up, it would be clear your pants were undone; I think the band (which looks more like a layer) might be safer in that sense.
B00L28J9KQ|4|Stupid cheap and I get compliments all the time! Not sure how long it will last, but was a fun vacation suit.
B007UIOV4G|5|This is a cute outfit. I bought it for my 3 year old son for my nephews christening. It was perfect for the occasion!  I got soo many compliments. My son is a big 3 year old so the size 4 fit him perfect!
B001GKM4WA|2|I finally found a belt to fit my waist size. However the belt does not have a rich look. For the price though, it wasn't bad.
B000CRHEGE|4|This was a gift for my husband.  The only thing he didn't like about it was the snap on the inside that held the pictures.  This made it more bulky than he liked so he removed the snap.
B00JO9P4S6|4|Wish it was a bit bigger,  cute though.
B009Q2Z58A|3|What I forget when I buy vassarette bras is where the snaps are there is not enough material or cushion so it hurts my back until the bra has had several washes. The price is right so that is why I purchase this brand sometimes.<br />The seller is ok-bra came on time and was packaged wonderfully.
B00HHYI3S8|5|I love the look of seersucker, and was very excited to receive these dress shorts! We received a 4T for my 3-year-old son, who is tall for his age. The shorts do fit him, but because there is little to no 'give' in the waist, he may not be able to wear them through the entire summer season. The length is wonderful, and they look very handsom paired with a white shirt- dress shirt, or polo. These shors are a great option for dresswear for spring and summer, or for special occasions, such as a summer wedding, etc. The shorts aren't super stiff, but they're a bit more contricting than a basic cotton short, so just keep that in mind. We're looking forward to having pictures taken with my son in these shorts- they're so cute!
B00B182KP8|5|Love, love, love this bra!!<br />It is true to size, IMO.<br />And it is super comfy!!<br />I'll update with any changes, as I just wore it today :)
B00SCGUYFU|1|I am very skinny. So I ordered size S . Honestly, the look like L. Huge, they go up until the chest and they are hanging on my legs. Very disappointed.
B003RBQKGM|5|One of my favorites!  Very becoming and flattering!
B006FKQHSI|5|Fred Perry is my son's favorite clothier. However, the clothes are a little above my normal budget range. I can always count on Amazon to offer Fred Perry's &#34;past season&#34; designs at an affordable price.  This sweatshirt was an incredible value.
B00859G8AO|4|I am almost 5'8&#34; and found the tall was the best size for me. They were a little long but I tried one size down and had to return them.  They kept sliding down. I tried a bunch if maternity hose and these were the best! Comfortable and decent support. They did eventually get holes in the heals but this was after a lot of usage.
B008TKIH8K|5|The PJs are soft and cozy.  They were a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves them. ..... Maybe a bit thin, but she doesn't care.
B00GDE8XME|5|It's durable, rugged, and works great so you don't have to take your gloves off when working outdoors. Gave it as a gift and other people wanted one too.
B009MI6NIO|3|I found the fit to be a little too loose. So they ride up and didn't feel as supportive as I had hoped. I don't find the system that separates your package from your legs to be all that amazing - in fact I hardly notice the effect.<br /><br />If they made an XS then I might give it a try, but I wear a small in other brands and they always fit fine. The Saxx small just isn't snug enough.
B00XVMXN4O|5|This dress is WOW! So super cute. I am 5'7&#34; and between 155-160 pounds and a medium fit well. Definitely pay attention to the size chart. In the same brand I was a large in a different style dress. For the price the quality is better than expected. Highly recommend!
B0094G8RU6|4|Tank is big, I ordered medium because small size had very small tank to go with this top. I usually wear it with leggings and it looks very cute, I receive compliments every time I wear.
B00L289B40|4|I liked it.  It was just too small across the shoulders for me.
B007CFDCWY|5|I bought the 180s for myself several years ago and use them constantly curing cold weather.  My &#34;adopted&#34; nieces kept borrowing them on one of our outtings, so I realized that they would make a great Christmas gift for all four of them (ages 6-14).  They like that they keep their ears warm but don't have the static electricity effect on their hair the way that hats and hoods do.
B005FNAB06|5|Fits snug
B0040MT1WC|5|They are great but a bit pricey here.
B00LUF8DHG|5|The waist didn't stretch as much as I expected but the skirt is beautiful. No other problems.
B00JE8PGFI|3|The cuffs were not sown down and can unraveled.  I did't like that.
B005F25LES|5|The package arrived very quickly, just a few days.  As instructed, we hung the costume up for a few days to get the wrinkles out, and it looked fine.  My daughter was ketchup, and her friend was the Heinz mustard costume.  They looked great and received many compliments for such original costumes.  The costume held it's shape nicely with the thin foamy material, and was comfortable for my daughter to wear.  We ordered the size 7-10.  My daughter is an average sized 10 year old, and the costume just fit, so if you have a big kid, it may be tight.  But, the costume worked out great for us, and I would definitely recommend it.
B00CHQ5G4U|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Robe is soft, quality material and it fit as expected.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B003IC7IZC|5|This is the perfect week for a Repunzel costume. My daughter is 6 and it worked perfectly on her little head. It didn't hold up too well in my daughter's dress up closet after Halloween. The wig will attach to any Velcro. And if any hair pulls out of the braid, its not possible (that I could find) to put it back in. But it was very cute and such a bargain for Halloween!
B00B6E5B6C|5|Great fit and style. Just make sure you follow the washing and drying rules, so you don't shrink them.
B00K0FOW6I|3|Looks fine
B00130RT1O|5|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. The leather is very soft and great size.  Great buy.
B00L2KSA36|5|the fit is good for being one size fits all. They do have a tendency to ride up but I'm very used to that already with other dresses that I have so I'm used to it. These however will only be worn as slips underneath other dresses.
B000V0706G|3|Our son is 21 months and did not fit in this costume. It was all velcro, which is fine, but a little itchy.
B004QMLR00|5|GREAT
B00AMQ1ENY|5|I ordered a large for my 5-year-old, who normally wears a 6-6x or girls XS.  This was a little long (the crotch was a little low), but otherwise, fit great with a little wiggle room.
B00HU257LS|5|It is a super cute kit! Loved it!
B001UHMWH6|5|My 20 year old boy is a sworn Levi's 514 man!  He wears nothing else but Levi's and he is worth it...! The fit is fantastic, the style, timeless, and the quality unparalleled....Of course it helps to have the body of a Greek god...
B00JOP6556|5|It gets the job done for all those sheer dresses.
B00JLB23ZE|4|This shirt is really cute and it fits my sister really well. I ordered  size 8 and she's a small 8 year old.
B0051U15V2|5|Good quality, heavy and absorbent.  My foot is size 9 and these are just a bit snug.
B00X3EYXQM|5|The fabric is so soft and comforatable!  The fit is perfect, the length is exactly what I was looking for.  I need more in different colors!
B00G2KTTDG|4|Cute. Serves the purpose I wanted it to.
B00G38D4TC|4|nice print and cut of the tank to show off the build.  horizontal stripe design is pretty common but this one adds a little more flavor than just plain bars.
B00B6EBM10|5|I bought 2 pairs of these previously and just bought 2 more. Very durable and comfortable jeans.
B00CE3J5SO|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT, I RECOMMEND
B00G0VVBRO|4|Really nice quality and super cute.  It's huge on my 4 year old but my kids are tiny.  Of course, he decided he likes to swim without a shirt anyway.
B00ZT3XOWO|5|Glamorous Embroidered Kurti tunic is beautiful, lightweight and very well constructed but longer than i expected. The fabric is very fine and lightweight, with lovely glasswork embroidery. The color is beautiful and it is so soft to wear. Looks like fine expensive hand embroidery!<br />It is a very stylish design, trendy and elegant which is suitable for any occasion. You can wear with leggings or jeans. The shirt is very long - as is the style of these tunics - but it is nicely tapered near the waist so it defines your figure. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly (I am normally a medium).<br /><br />I received this tunic at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review. All opinions are my own and are not influenced.
B00HRM6R1K|4|This image is just like the Valentine Lisa gave Ralph on The Simpsons. I couldn't resist this shirt for my 4 year old for Valentine's Day. It is slightly smaller than other 4Ts he has, but it didn't shrink or fade in the wash.
B006VI3MCS|4|This pin has beautiful detail, the photo does not show that the moon is polished to a glossy almost mother of pearl like sheen. The black is very shiny and the pin back itself very study. Though is smaller than an inch tall. I expected this to be a little bit bigger, but I am not disappointed overall.
B009FXKYAY|4|Super cute!
B000OVCWWY|4|They are good. I order then for my boyfried he liked them.
B008MJP46G|5|Great and hassel free.  Love the look and fit
B003LO1WTA|5|When I ordered the Carhartt Men's Twill Work Pants, I wasn't sure how well I would like them.  I have never owned Carhartt clothing before, so had no frame of reference for these pants.  Boy, was I surprised!  I knew Carhartt's reputation for building really tough clothing for outdoor work (I think farmers and loggers spending all day outside in harsh conditions).  But as far as indoor work pants, this was new.  I am SO GLAD I got them.  The construction is superior to anything I have seen thus far.  Dickies, as nice as they are, are not nearly as well made as these.<br />I work in the 'quick serve' (fast food) industry as a manager, so I am called on to do everything in the store - from cashiering to cooking, from prep to paperwork, I do it all!  These pants are so rugged, I feel like I can do anything my restaurant requires of me with little thought as to what will happen to my clothes.  The stain resistant/liquid repellent coating is excellent for rejecting water that is frequently splashed on me; and grease seems to have no effect on them (as far as clean up goes).  These pants really are that good!<br />I now have 3 pair purchased through Amazon and will buy 2 more to round out my work wardrobe.<br />My only concerns with these pants are (as has been mentioned by other reviewers) 1. the lack of pocket depth.  They skimped a bit on pockets with these pants, they are about an inch or so too shallow.  One would expect them to think that real \\"workers\\" carry a good amount of junk in their pockets! And 2. The number of belt loops seems to vary from pant to pant.  The first order I received (30 x 34) had 7 loops, pretty standard for pants these days.  But the subsequent orders (30 x 32, and 28 x 32) only had 5 loops.  One would think that a 30 inch waist is a 30 inch waist and should have 7 loops every time.  I might see only 5 on a 28 inch waist due to it being so small, but come on!  A couple extra loops makes a big difference in how they fit and feel (secure or less so) when worn.<br />Oh and a note to those who order from Carhartt, they tend to go a little large on their sizing. That's why my first pair was a 30 x 34, I have a little waist and long legs, but these are TOO long.  Also the waist is \\"generous\\".  My actual size (which is nearly impossible to find without tailoring is 29 x 33.  So, most companies I order from offer 30 x 32 or 34, I usually go for the 30 x 34 and they work great.  But they are a bit too loose from Carhartt, so I got the 28 x 32 and they fit 'snug' but comfortable and the length is spot on.<br /><br />Every thing seems well attached and constructed very well, so I do heartily endorse these Carhartt work pants as being tough and comfortable for a full 10 hour work shift.  Hope this review helps you in making your decision to purchase these pants.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Especially for the great price Amazon offers!!
B0007ORAT8|5|I had been wanting a pair of chacos for quite a while, but the adjustable straps never quite felt right.  These do not have that problem.  They look great and are quite comfortable.
B00HC0N0VW|5|Large but I love it
B00BWKJ9K4|5|I'm wearing this to my revow wedding. I am EXCITED to wear this dress - thank you so much !!!!!
B00D6PZQOG|5|Love this shirt. Got it for my dad for Christmas and he couldn't stop laughing. It fit as expected.
B000QW6LLE|5|True to size. I'm 5'1&#34; and 189lbs I usually wear a 10-12 dress size and I ordered a XL. Wish i would've ordered the Large instead just for an extra inch or 2 of cinching. I'm used to waist training so I love the fact that putting it on was a bit if a struggle. (Wonderful workout for one's arms) The trainer does bunch a little in the back but I always pair my trainer with a girdle boyshort panty for an even smoother look beneath my clothing. Shipped overnight arrived nicely package. Definitely a true Squeem! Week be ordering from this vendor again!
B00K4XQMAU|5|nice on her
B00O42QGWG|4|The poncho is much better than any raincoat- not as many buttons or buttonholes to be destroyed by small fingers! I love how they match, and of course, so does my three year old! The umbrella is not as hardy as the poncho, however: it is made with a somewhat weaker material. This poncho and umbrella combo is a must-have for all those very useful little engines out there!
B000YRUZTK|5|Fun costume. Great fit but stuff some paper in the top part so the Banana will stand up straight.<br />We put on a play and the kids loved loved loved the banana!!!!
B008EWNC5Q|5|great
B001MIYT7E|5|I recently bought the item. I need it for indoor swimming. The material is smooth and fine. Well designed, strong enough for indoor. It has built in mash brief. I love it.
B000LNJ7F0|5|Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.
B00E4XWK3E|5|The sweats fit a little large to give room for shrinking.  The description did not mention that the pullover is lined with a thin fleece.  This will keep me warm in the coldest weather and allow me to keep exercising outside during the cold snaps.
B00GFDGCXA|5|My daughter loves this dress.  It's so comfortable and easy to wear.  In fact, I'm going to buy it in other colors.
B00JWLDI02|4|bought these for my grandson... he loves em... remember tho... these things are<br />skinny jeans and they are really skinny...  if you like skinny you'll love these  - LOL<br />me ... i would never be caught in em.. much less be able to get em on...
B00E68Z8IG|1|They are way to big. I would not buy them again. If I could trade them I soul get happier or get my money back.
B005CSP082|5|I usually wear medium but just had a feeling. When it arrived, it was slightly too large. After the first wash today, it fit exactly as I wanted it to fit so be warned: it shrinks.
B00PQ0ED8Y|2|They were a great material but they were just too small
B003AV9A70|5|I'm writing this review earlier than I should, but. So far I love 'em, only strike is the legs are kinda long. I manage. The best thing was they have pockets! I thought I was trading 100% cotton for pockets when I ordered. I like pockets, I wear these around the apt. and don't mind wearing them out to get the mail and such. They don't look like PJs. They are comfortable, warm enough without being too warm. Great for lounge pants when you don't need to dress up at home. I originally bought the navy and am coming back for a gray set. I'll amend this review if something happens after a few washings.
B004X4PAFY|5|The two-piece butterfly jumper is well made and adorable. The sage corduroy is very soft. I think it will be very comfortable. My granddaughter will love it.
B00DRKKVL8|5|This skirt is very flattering and soooooo comfortable !!  I'll order more for sure in different colors and possible for gifts.
B00MHDXZXC|3|the dress is pretty, the neckline is different from the what is in the picture. but it's cute. very short torso though, i feel that it could be lowered a little bit, i am short but when i have the dress on, it feels like my waistline is too high up, i understand empire cut, but this dress is made to mimic peplum cut, so it has to hit you in the right spot. it comes with the cute belt too. One thing i noticed while trying it on, the hemline is super weird. i am not sure if it is a defect or a design. if i look at the side, the back of the skirt is longer which would make think &#34;oh, it's a hi-low&#34; and then you look at the left side and be like, &#34;why is the front longer&#34;? weird weird stuff, never seen this style before if this is indeed a style. lol.<br /><br />funny story: i wore this to church last sunday and got compliments. it is cute. but a 12 year girl noticed the hemline and told me that i should turn my skirt cause she only saw the side with the front being longer. i just laughed and said, i don't know if it's a design or a defect, but it looks cute.
B0086L7OIG|2|V skinny fit!
B009KY1TIO|1|I am very disappointed.  The band at the waist on these has come detached after just a few washings. So far two of them have become totally useless.
B00D4EEGMW|2|Super cute, got it to match my daughter's lunch box ... but it's not practical for kindergarten! Her folder sticks out on both sides, and is bent if you try to close the backpack! This shouldn't be marketed as a backpack, but rather a cute sleepover bag or something kids can use for ballet or other activities!!!
B00L3X4CQQ|5|Lover the pants, very comfortable.  True to size I'm 5'6 147 lbs (size 8).
B0080DOMCQ|5|I break these often (I leave them unprotected in my purse) and I still buy more! Love the way they look!
B003G5U6NW|5|The hat shipped fast and came in great condition.  For being inexpensive the hat is of good quality, fits great, and looks outstanding.  I got compliments the first time I wore it out.  I already ordered another hat from this company and will order more in the future I'm sure.  Overall, great experience buying from this company.
B00ECGLJUS|5|I bought this for my boyfriend at the Outlets in town and he loves it!  You can't get much better than a sweater with hula dancing reindeer!  And the fact that it actually has the white color up at the top only made it a little more authentic.  He's been wearing it ever since and gets so many comments on it.<br />Probably my favorite thing about this item is that it is reversible.  It's not just a Holiday sweater it is something that can be worn all throughout the year.<br />It is high quality and even washed up really nicely.  I definitely would recommend this item to anyone who has a sense of humor!
B00AYEYCBA|5|Love the fit.  Need a shirt to match.  They are comfortable too.  I have nothing else to say.  Love them
B007GCOHLI|5|satisfied
B002RH582E|4|I am tall (5'10\\"), and I have thicker thighs (24.5\\" circumference). These fit well, and tended to stay up better than other thigh-highs. Sometimes they rolled/folded-over in the back, and I re-adjusted them quite a few times in my wearings. As lingerie, they are adorable. As daily wear, they are sufficient.
B00H8AJIDA|5|good
B009XURNSU|5|A little itchy
B000J0GWFI|2|Chap looking and feeling sent it back.
B00IV3HK1U|5|So cute!
B00HFY6ZS0|5|This pretty purple hair claw holds my thick hair really tight, even on a windy day.  I like the larger length as well.
B004TJ9YGO|2|I ordered a size 3 because that is the size of Torrid that I usually wear (22/24)... I received them today and they are more like an actual size 3 than a Torrid size 3... it barely fits up my legs... so be forewarned... they run SMALL (don't know why they do here on Amazon I order from the Torrid website all the time and never have sizing issues) NO ZIPPER just a button and where the zipper should be is sown shut, but the button does open and close.
B00H8KKKF0|5|perfect fit and perfect color
B001UQUNJG|5|A very nice shirt. It's quality.
B00DEX5UBE|5|I returned the 3X and got the 2X and it fits perfectly. The 3X was huge.It's a beautiful coat. x
B00B9CL61K|3|This jacket is very cute but the sleeves were really tight and the fabric didn't have much give so I had to send it back. It would probably look great on a teenager or very young adult.
B00HJOQKTU|5|The outfit fit perfectly for my lady. It hugged and lifted just as expected and was very sexy.
B005T8V0PC|5|Love my new shapewear perfect for my needs.  Amazon is awesome.  I can always rely on Amazon.  I've never had a problem with any of my orders.  Thank you Amazon
B00GIXVKFC|4|Well it does fit but I ordered it to be loose and it is therefore too small. I am not a huge person, but I ordered a triple X large because I find that large things are really not so large. So, If you want a loose fit order about 3 times what you would normally wear.
B00AJWZ8HE|5|My daughter love's this fleece! It keeps her warm and is perfect for her.
B00EA7RKB6|5|Excellent material and fitting
B001UM1LSC|5|My order arrived without delay and perfectly shipped.  I tried on the Warrior Princess costume (becaue I ordered it in small), and it fit as I had hoped. Thanks for great super fun halloween costume!!
B00N9KJOXM|2|From the pic it looks like a cover up for the beach. Thats why I ordered it. But the model must be a sub zero size. Its light weight fabric & the arms do not come down that far. The pattern resembles pic but not up close. Way too young for a 40ish woman.
B006LPHJ7U|5|Ive had this for almost two years now. Best wallet I've ever had.. But it will reactive room keys so carful with that. Other than that, perfect if you hate sitting on your wallet.
B000VDXBKC|4|Got this to replace a bulkier, heavier double-fold wallet.<br />Definitely did the trick.<br />Plenty of space for my different cards, and deep enough for receipts and taller, foreign bills.
B00AK7Q4LC|5|Runs a little big but super comfortable to sleep in.
B00K17N73O|4|I love the suit but had to exchange it for one size bigger.
B00O48CHNM|5|LOVE IT!! (Sorry for the crappy picture!) looks better in person! Everything is great!
B00SMA49I4|5|Love it.baithsuit has very bright color and does not look cheap or made with cheap material.
B007JM9X1O|2|You have to get them three sizes bigger. They shrink, and they need to be washed a few times to be comfortable. Too bad the apron dose not come off. That is a pain. The knees where the pads go should have zippers or Velcro. Once in you can't get them out. And they move around after washing. These will be my last pair. Great for the cold weather if you order them big enough to where clothes underneath.
B00LBP0WZG|5|Every time my daughter wears this shirt I find I am snapping pictures left and right.  So cute.
B005H27BZ8|4|looks great its alot smaller then i thought it would be do not dry it or your screwed or order one size bigger
B007L6IDNM|5|Great, comfy and very flattering!! I'll probably buy another pair since I've been wearing it everyday. Definitely worth the price.
B00MN5JPYW|5|It's a nice shirt.
B00SKSZXF6|1|Do not buy ladies
B00BBCUFWY|5|Size expected. Comfortable, the material is not very thick. But I think I will be long-lasting. Roomy pockets. I liked.
B000W5OTSW|3|Adorable costume! I love that it comes with a stuffed carrot rattle. The material of the costume though is very thin and sheds a bit.
B005ISP2XO|5|I ordered this shirt for my Grad Bash weekend trip and its absolutely amazing. I thought it was a crewneck when I ordered it but the material is actually kind of longjohnish. But it doesn't look tacky at all and I didn't have to worry about being extremely hot while wearing it. Shipping was insanely fast. I'm about 5'6 138 pounds and a small fit me perfectly. My boyfriend got the one that says I ain't even mad bro and its too cute. 2 THUMBS UP!
B00CBTRUF6|1|Clothes despite its cost had details that made her look cheap and poorly made many details that disappoints
B00DQTP7LE|2|The belly band is uncomfortable at the top it's stitched over and it rubs on my already sensitive pregnant tummy. I don't love wearing these at all due to that. If you have &#34;thick skin&#34; so to speak, it may not bother you.
B00K7F4D7E|4|Its ok everything fits inside
B00EO97GWS|3|okay.
B00CO9QPLI|3|This lace top is beautiful, but not all 2x plus have the same bust size.  It fit perfectly, except the bust area, I'm much smaller.  I need to have it altered, otherwise, looks very nice.
B00O403U2W|5|This was a Xmas gift that was enjoyed by my grandaughter.
B00DGWTP4G|5|Super cute and pretty big for a purse hook but I love it because it held up two heavy small purses. Feels sturdy and thick so I don't think it will break.
B00K00UOHY|4|Love it! Looks exactly like it did on pics. Perfect color.
B00DRKOVUA|5|I've ordered 3 mediums ( blue, pink, and green thunder) husband says they are very comfortable, &#34;I like them&#34; this is from someone that I know for 30 years has worn swimming trunks. They do put forth the manly parts, not advised to wear around children/grandchildren but what a sight for my eyes. He wears 33/34 in waist.
B000YHNRD6|5|love this shirt
B00IJS365Q|3|I really hated that it was too small, however the quality of the material is really nice. Would give a 5 star if the one size fits all style really was accurate.
B00OV0X5PC|2|UNFORTUNATELY THE FIT / size was different. The black hat fit but the red hat was too small and visually smaller when compared one upon the other. Attempt to stretch /loosen it was unsuccessful. Too tight to wear.
B00EYXZ4XW|3|fine material. didn't fit at  all though.
B00CAAPM3I|5|This shirt is awesome!!!!!!! I've always wanted a superman new 52 shirt and its perfect. Fits perfectly too.
B00GRTNR12|1|This dress is nothing like the picture, it is really short and tight, it covers the buttocks and that's about it...the seller refused to pay the shipping fees so I'm stuck with a dress that doesn't fit and inappropriate to wear + I lost my money! I even submitted an A-Z claim and it has been refused!! what a customer service...
B00IHI9DVO|1|Very short & I'm 5'3. Can't even be worn as a tunic.  Just ugly
B00CB2M4SG|5|I got these for my boyfriend (im kind of addicted to buying him boxer briefs) they where so hot on him. Theyre a bit shorter than i thought they would be, they look really good on him though. Diesel boxers in general have slightly tighter waists, which is nice cuz my bf's waist is really small. They fit him perfect, he says theyre really comfy.
B0029F26DS|5|This hat is great.  It covers your face and back of neck.  The best part is I don't get a headache.  Many hats give me headaches I think it is due that my head would get really hot.  With this hat that doesn't happen.  I bought 2 of these in different colors.  Love all the colors that they come in.  When traveling the hat fits great in your purse or backpack just fold it or roll the hat.  Very comfortable hat.
B007USFRX0|4|I am in love with the costume. It's exactly what I expected but yes there's a but its too big. I am 4'11 110p and I am a small in everything.I was a Xsmall when I was 95pounds so when it fit me too big I was very disappointed because I know it's not me but the costume. It fits as if it was a medium. Also another thing that was upsetting was that the knock out nurse badge did not come with the costume although it said it was included they must have forgotten to put it in . I guess. Debating on sending it back or getting it fixed?? Other then that it looks just as the picture.
B002WTC6DG|4|Out of the package these socks fit well. I purchased these as the reviews where in favor of the quality. The quality is there as they have gone thru three washes and drying and still hold up well.
B00QTKUPDW|5|Best underwear I've ever had
B00FVRI1H6|4|I'm usually a small but they only had a large so I got it...It doesn't fit terribly big so I think it runs small. The arm holes (Excuse me for not knowing the technical term ;) are large...my bra shows on the sides, but then again I think its meant to be that way. The fabric feels nice. I just got it so I haven't washed it therefor I can't attest for it's durability.
B0043539S8|5|Super soft, nice length.
B008DKMZZC|5|Gracias por la atencion, excelente producto, espero volver a comprarles en un futuro cercano, los felicito por la calidad de lo vendido
B0038JQUQI|5|Got 3 prs of these for dirt cheap..  mailed from China.<br />Got here within a few weeks.<br />Good value. would purchase again.
B00MCXZ10M|5|Purchased as a gift. It certainly meets my expectations.
B00CHKGQZO|4|It's 6 degrees and my hands are warm, nuff said.
B0013BJY7K|5|Received order very quickly. My son loves his shirt, just what he wanted and fits great.
B0087RFRHY|1|I am 5'5\\" 125lbs and this dress (size large) wouldn't even fit over my shoulders...the dress was super cute, the color was perfect and the material seemed breathable (but I couldn't really tell because I couldn't get the thing on)If you are bigger than a size 00...it wont fit...at all.<br /><br />Ladies, definately don't waste your time OR money!
B00P8443G0|5|I weigh 160 lbs and 5'7&#34; . I ordered a large and it fit perfect!! The quality is very good and very stretchy and comfortable. I will buy more colors.
B00BGCQ6HW|5|fits perfectly. im 17 and it's usually hard to find a bra that fits, supports well, is comfortable, and not look like a grannys bra. i would absolutly buy again.
B00C5KIT4M|5|Love, love, love!  Great for every occasion, with heels or boots.  The best skinny jean every, super comfortable!  Knees do not bag out, and they wash up beautifully
B00ACIH9UE|4|Decent
B00K76MMH6|1|This is sized incorrectly
B005SN5HOI|5|Well, from a female point of view ;) I love these shirts! I've found that women's shirts are a snug it and for at home comfort I don't like that. The women's shirts I've had also tend to shrink in length or you have to hang dry to prevent shrinkage. These are long enough that if they shrink they're still a good length.<br />These are my go-to shirt when I'm home and just want to be comfortable ~ my night shirt or my around the house shirt, my it doesn't matter if it gets dirty shirt. They're very soft and comfortable and being that they're white if they get dirty or stained from whatever I get myself into I can bleach the heck out of them and they're good as new :) Just an idea for you ladies :) Think outside the box and consider that men's clothing could sometimes be the perfect thing for the occasion. The 5 pack works out to $3.79 per shirt :)
B00GSXP9SQ|5|gorgeous colors, fun for the summer
B00ACIFULY|5|Amazing fit and texture. They dont overshrink and fall apart, like most.
B00HFYAQQM|1|This product is horrible. Do not buy! Poor quality, very cheaply made and runs very small. Did not arrive when expected and the seller does not return emails. I don't even want to give it a star.
B0055XFERG|5|GREAT FOR GUYS INTO SKINNY JEANS. BEING A JR JEAN, THESE ARE CUT SLIMMER THAN WOMEN'S SKINNY JEANS. I TAKE A 9 OR 11 IN THESE AND A 30 OR 31 IN WOMEN'S. THESE ARE GREAT FOR EVERY DAY WEAR NOT SO MUCH FOR CLUBBING. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT SKINNY JEAN FOR A GUY THAT'S REALLY CLASSY, CHECK OUT THE SEVEN FOR ALL MANKIND \\"ROXANNE\\" ; THEY MAKE BOTH A GREAT DENIM AND CORDUROY JEAN THAT RUN TRUE TO SIZE.
B00I2T0LC8|3|very nice quality, but really needed a small and was not an option. disappointing to pay shipping for delivery and return
B0049GYZSE|5|It's all about zippers. These onesies are soft & easy to get on and off. The zipper comes in handy for those middle of the night diaper changes. Also I always miss a button!
B000AL7DZO|4|Very pretty for the price. For my daughter's first communion. Didn't want to spend too much, she liked this and I liked this. Well packaged. Came in one piece easily - no missing pearls or jewels. Not too gaudy... just enough.
B001W9AEB8|3|I like the length of the capris over my knees but they should have designed it to come higher above the waist.  It rolls down below the waist leaving me feeling very uncomfortable!
B003QHZI5G|4|Really great length and style. Not too short but but too long. Flattering too but I'm not sure it's call it &#34;supportive&#34; the way another review did. Its just lace.<br />I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it has pilled a little even though I wash it in a delicates bag. Its not too bad but still... It wasn't cheap even on the lightening deal.
B0037TIDY6|5|Excelent Item! i´ve always dreamed being a ninja turtle, now i´m half way there. Great Desing, Nice Materials and Bright Colors
B00MOIFVT6|4|Looks cute ...... for Christmas gift so don't know if it fits or if she likes it.
B00CIZLCIY|5|Exactly as described. True to size and the color was very close to the picture (maybe a slight bit darker). I plan to order a few more.
B003Q6CG0C|5|First ordered this jacket is a medium thinking it may run small. I was wrong, it is true to size and the medium was to big. I ordered the small and it fits perfectly, returning the medium. I love the feel of the material, sturdy yet soft. Style is comfortable yet flattering. Very pleased with my purhcase.
B00DF3KBZS|4|the reviews all said it ran small so i doubled the size and ordered a 24 month for a 12 month old.  And it was almost snug.  BUY BIG.  but very adorable and the whoile family loved it
B002GHC1MA|5|My son loves it
B001R4C9PC|5|all ok
B001Y5SHVY|1|I can't rightly review the product itself, because I never received it.  Original penguin just issued me a refund and didn't send me anything, and on top of that failed to inform me of any of this, leaving me waiting indefinitely for my shipment to arrive.  It's funny that an item which is out of stock is somehow miraculously still up for sale on this site.  Not a trustworthy seller!  I realize this review should be in the seller rating category, but since the purchase never actually went through I can't submit one.
B007OQOS6A|5|Love these pantyhose and they have stopped selling them at my Walmart. I was so glad to find them online.
B008B81LP6|3|I ordered an XL based on the reviews of others, thinking that ordering two sizes larger than normal would work. SOOOOO wrong. This shirt is super tight in all the areas where women need a little more room. I look like I'm wearing a girls size shirt instead of a womens shirt as stated on this product! URGH!
B00AZTRHRK|5|Love these swim trunks! By far the best pair my hubby has ever owned!! They fit true to size and the color looks amazing!
B003AZ6PI8|5|We've shopped around a lot for baseball hats and this is the only one sized \\"Infant\\" that wasn't too big for my guy. It is still roomy, but it does not fall down over his eyes.  It is well made. The stitching is great.
B00DDZBQJS|5|I like it! my son like it! it's great! i will bay more  U.s.POLO clothing for my son! very warm!
B00LBP1AHA|4|worked well but you have to had wash them.
B007QFQ0RO|3|these stockings are lovely, well made, and comfortable.... if my legs could fit them. my legs are not even that big but these squeeze and roll down my thighs. so if your not super thin these are not going to fit. but they are still really good quality.
B002Z2FXNK|5|Fits good and feels great.  Warm enough when its cold, but not too much that you can still wear it on a chilly night.
B00KCNZ74E|3|It came nicely wrapped and folded, and it did take awhile to put on. The only problem I did receive with it was that the belt part of the straps was to big for buckles and I had to have a friend help me. The sizes fit nicely though. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone who needs to quickly put the straps on.
B00ZQ4YZQU|5|Looks just like the picture
B000BRMGJU|3|The material is heavier than I expected.  If it was like the thin lightweight nylon, then I would give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.
B00FDPQM40|1|the vest i got is not only a bit similar with what it looks in the picture.<br />this is absolutely not acceptable, this is absolutely a fraud!!!<br />please DO ONT buy anything from this seller.
B00BNR4MOY|5|I love this suit. The price was great and the fast shipment exceeded my expectations. Great company, great product, great people! Thanks!
B00GKGGZH0|5|very nice wallet but I wish it had one more pocket, yet its OK wonderful and serves the job  :)
B00IXCWF50|3|I like the bottoms although I expected a somewhat thicker material because it looks like &#34;jeans.&#34;<br /><br />The top is way too padded. I'm a 34D and I definitely don't need or want that much padding/lift. Now I understand the ladies with smaller bits may want this padding but it would be nice if it were removable, or if they put less padding in the larger sizes. I got a size large because my boobs are always too big for anything in my usual medium size from China.<br /><br />Can't really complain at this price tho! I guess the girls will just be giving the guys a show at the beach -_____-
B00JAXTLIA|5|Beautiful. Too big.
B0007CKJ7K|5|Nothing but wrangler jeans for me
B005OIVCWS|5|This outfit was a lot thinner than I thought it was going to be, but is very durable, and great for the summer months! My son loves the characters and the bright colors. The size runs a little bigger than the true to size number, but just enough for them to grow into by the end of summer!
B005KGKZ7W|1|Nice material but the sizes are extremely smaller than you would think. I ordered a medium or (USA small) because all of my clothes are a size small. I am a 5'5 male 140 lbs and I couldn't get my arm through the first sleeve . When I forced it all the way on, the waist of the sweater reached my shoulder blades. No exaggeration.
B008Y3BGTY|5|This was for my husband who turned 50.  I thought this shirt was perfect since he loves to fish as much as he can.
B002HJ377A|5|How do I turn off the howling feature?  Two of the three wolves howl at night.  The other one (the pup in the middle) howls during the day for some reason.  Not sure if this is a factory defect.<br /><br />This shirt won't stop.  Can't sleep.  It's been days.  Please help.
B0094XNKD8|5|THESE ARE THE BEST BIRTHSTONE CHARMS I HAVE EVER FOUND.  THESE  ARE GOING TO BE MOTHERS DAY GIFTS FOR MY SISTERS.
B008YU8VMW|4|bueno
B00A03I65S|5|Quality was better than expected. ordered it as a gift but will be ordering another for myself.  Very comfortable and doesn't fade.
B00JV8JM6U|1|I was so excited to order this sweater....and the excitement quickly left me as soon as I opened the bag. I read a review which said to order a size or two bigger than you normally would because this brand tends to run small; I usually wear a Large or XL so I ordered a 2X and still it was too small. WAY too small. The sizing however was the least of my concerns. In the picture it looked like a nice thick, structured material that would wear like a jacket or at least lay how it shows in the photograph. Yeah, not so much. It's a super thin material. So thin, in fact, that I could hold it up and see through it. This part is on me but I didn't realize that the main photograph for this sweater is the back not the front. The front is just a lame clasp. I thought the front would be the corset part. Again, that's my fault for not noticing but still they don't usually use the back of clothing for the main picture. Anyway, back to the drawing board.
B00SUOB840|4|A little tight in the chest, but I've been lifting weights for a long time. Beautiful shirt.
B00TZ6EO1G|5|Very flattering and incredibly comfortable. Needed to be hemmed for a 30&#34; inseam if you want to wear flats.
B00EZW46UE|5|This tee is awesome!  My brother in law loved it!
B002K6F7AA|5|Very comfortable, medium support, perfect for sleeping and wearing around the house. It also allows you to nurse anywhere easily.
B00524WLGK|5|My son's really like these jeans and you can't beat the price!!!!
B00UL4YGHS|1|Way too small.
B009FBSRAA|5|The picture does not do this skirt justice.  It is beautiful!  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Embroidery is beautiful and the sequins dotting the pattern of the skirt glimmer in the sunlight.  Perfect with sandals and a t-shirt for the summer.  Don't pass this one by!
B00JENBE2W|5|Very cute but runs small
B00BZAXQR8|5|Great for summer patriotic holidays.
B00CTWH5ZK|4|bought for a friend. the size chart was accurate and she loved this costume and got many compliments. will definitely recommend to anyone for next halloween.
B0085SLM6U|5|I bought this jacket for my son and the quality is excellent.  He is a boy of 6 years old but this size is perfect for him
B00H7LXN9A|4|Beautiful dress, but way to small thru the bust. I usually wear a 1x so I ordered 1x/2x thinking it would give me extra room. Not so, this runs small... Other than that really like the dress
B00KVMZKR0|4|Great choice!
B00JMQ6ZYI|5|I bought this shirt from a Ross, size XL. I love it! I'm pregnant and have been searching for bigger comfy clothes, especially with it being summer. I wear this shirt all the time! Very soft material. I will definitely buy this in smaller sizes!
B000RK2UBA|5|I absolutely adore this dress. I have worn it so much this fall season. It is just so comfortable and stylish. A lot of look for the money. And I bought it at full price.
B00KMZPFBM|4|Im going to return exchange for xxl size
B00KD2QT14|1|These pajamas are much smaller sized than normal pajamas.  Like a med is like the size of a super small size.
B005VCDKFE|5|I have worn the old one out. Friends have used it as well and say it's awesome. i am still using mine. I sent this one to my friend as a gift. :)
B000LYJD6M|5|this is a great bra, my husband likes the way it makes my ##### look.
B00809ABHK|5|Bought these more as a joke, but I felt pretty empowered while wearing them.... Not bad!
B002S1D3AI|5|I am not new to the Retro X jacket.  I purchased my first one back in 1999.  Thirteen years later, I am still impressed with this awesome jacket.  The good news is that I have really put this jacket to the test.  The better news is that it is everything I had hoped it would be and then some.  Using this jacket on numerous winter cold weather expeditions in Alaska, Northern Rockies and even in the Canadian Arctic it has had ample opportunity to disappoint.  It has never dissapointed me.  In my line of work, I spend several weeks (3-5) at a time in the wilderness in cold climates, the last thing I want to be worrying about is staying warm.  This jacket has taken more abuse than most people will be able to dish out in a lifetime.  It still has many serviceable years in it.  I wear it as a mid-layer under my Gore-Tex shell and over my Patagonia expedition weight capilene, or on milder days 20's - 30's I simply use it without the Gore-Tex shell.  The jacket is more stiff than you would expect when new, but becomes quite supple with a few washings.  The windproof membrane is absolutely essential in a fleece jacket.  In cool/cold windy conditions a fleece jacket is useless as outerwear without the windproofing membrane.  I recently purchased another Patagonia Retro X...not because my 1st one is worn out, but simply because I saw it at a price that I couldn't refuse.  Even at full retail this jacket is must have for me.  Comfortable, warm, functional and quality workmanship in a very durable, lightweight garment.  What more could a person want in a jacket?
B003PXC1ZQ|5|My husband loves it.  He likes the many pockets.
B005C91QYS|1|The front section is too small to cover the whole area.  I should have listened to the other reviews. Which stated that it did not cover well
B00IPAB0JM|5|If I had to say anything, they are a bit short. Will work, and I like them. I just can't turn the cuffs up.
B00HZ745D4|5|I love these, so cute and I've gotten several compliments.
