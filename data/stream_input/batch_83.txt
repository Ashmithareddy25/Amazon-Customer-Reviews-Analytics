B00C3VSZAQ|5|Work great.  Used for running lights on boat and are bright with good distance for running at night.
B00OV7HKA6|3|I have mixed feelings.  It would not jump-start my Mitsubishi Diesel Van (tried on several different different occasions).  I used it successfully to jump-start a friends car.  However, shortly afterwards, the blinking flashlight started coming on by itself and eventually could not be turned off until the battery died.  It now no longer charges.
B003RVMPIE|5|it worked perfect
B00T3E8XBC|5|Ordered this to surprise my dad after he purchased a new car.  He loves that the decal has &#34;just enough detail&#34; and was easy to apply.  Very pleased with this product.
B000GVFDG4|5|Really nice cover! Fits my big bear chopper nicely.
B00RW7WW50|5|The item is really easy to install and also works fine. Will write a update in a month.
B008J4UMX4|4|Overall I like it, easy install but use the stock bolt to secure it.
B00R248W1G|5|Great
B00CHD0V9I|5|perfect fit!!
B00PT18QAQ|4|I am very pleased with its easy to read dial and one hand operation. I would give it 4 ½ stars.

B00522VDV6|5|A
B0094JURYM|5|So far very happy with this, No signs of overheating or high pressures in the system.  Will keep on monitoring and provide more feedback as time passes.
B0002U2V1O|5|It gives such a deep shine and good protection for the paint. Goes on easy comes off good and than I use a microfiber rag to get a good shine. It's great for chrome too.
B0016J46V8|5|Awesome

B00JZQXJ3K|4|seems all good.
B00TQ07IOQ|4|perfect color, material could be a bit heavier, but great non the less, shipping was very quick
B00SNQ5J5Y|3|It seems to be a decent cover but I was told that it would fit my 03 Cadillac CTS and it does not. I had to tear the whole thing open to get it around the seat and stitch it back. Very annoying.
B00C5SY1AK|5|What is there to say. It is exactly as described; nothing more, nothing less.
B001DMDRUO|5|Fits fine, lightweight and waterproof.
B005Z8HAUK|5|Very useful, worth the price.
B001445IZ8|5|Perfect for boat or riding lawnmower...

B00I26SJ6Q|4|Good product
B0067EGFZ2|5|Sounds great quick shipping wish gasket came with it other then that awesome
B000BQLVKG|2|poor quality. you get what you pay for
B00R3LDL64|5|looks great on my car!
B00HSFB4TG|5|I haven't been able to find a cabin filter for my SUV in a store anywhere.  I was stoked to see these on Amazon and at the same price similar (but not compatible) filters were going for in stores.  I popped my old filter out (you can tell it was a wicked pollen year!) and put slid this on in.  You can definitely tell a difference when the air is on now!  It isn't as noisy, probably because it's not trying to flow through all that dirt!  I will probably buy several and keep them handy to swap out as needed.
B00LEBLI82|5|Work perfectly and delivered quickly!
B00JAMYDFC|5|This stuff works like magic on my white vinyl auto interior.
B00QN8EV80|1|really cheap looking
B00EPDLQTM|5|excellent product, exactly as depicted....and super fast delivery!!!
B00N1WCKW0|5|Perfect fit, nice quality.  Excellent value for the price.  Highly recommend.
B00DTBNWM0|5|Great
B000C9QUFI|5|good price
B0050PKW6M|5|It's great fits perfect<br />High quality durable vest
B004FHEPSM|5|Perfect fit better than stock in mud
B00FB3L0A0|5|The product was exactly as expected. 100% satisfied.
B00KY0MPH2|5|Works great
B002P8DHUU|5|The part met my expectation and I'm very happy with it. It saved me a lot of cash. Thank you
B00DZUDCFC|4|was worth the money and wasnt expensive
B00KN0UOEE|3|Can't really tell if it's working on my Sea Eagle boat, but they recommend it. So far so good
B005UGJ3MU|5|They work great
B00D9C2CDO|4|It's a black waterproof bag. If you want a black waterproof bag then this is the black waterproof bag for you.
B003QVJ3ZI|4|Made just like Scion/Toyota original equipment replacement parts at a reasonable price.
B0048YIY98|5|so far so good just installed this today quieter and smooth. Will update after a few weeks and see how well they last.
B000ARPVQ6|3|It's the same price as everywhere else. I got if for an oil change that was becoming Due while I purchased a few other items. Using the ford parts for your 6.0l power stroke is a must. If nothing else the  oil and fuel filters. It's really stupid to do otherwise
B00R5ZWO4I|3|Looks good and went on smooth just the passenger side door one sticks up more than it should but over good product.
B009JCU1ZO|3|Does not provide Mini DTC codes, which is what I wanted. The site that's supposed to give you all the associated repair info. doesn't provide much. Very disappointed in the scanner not the seller. Good price.
B005CLPEQ2|5|its fulled my expectation
B00B1VAMUU|5|Great
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great shade !!!
B00GFTN3I6|5|We use this product to seal connectors from moisture.  It works perfectly.
B0136I3S4C|5|I was really impressed with this little charger! I did not think that something so compact could do what it claims, but it does!<br /><br />First, I really appreciated the cables that came with this unit. You can charge it via the USB wall adapter or with the cigarette light adapter that is included. Also included is a multi-cable that I think will be really useful to keep in my glovebox so that I have a charging cable for just about any kind of mobile device that my passengers or I might be traveling with. I also loved the little jumper cables and agree with some of the other reviews that at least for the rest of the summer I will keep all of the cables in my car and bring the actual charging brick with me so as not to degrade the battery. The 5400mAh battery is a nice size and although I do have a charger with a larger capability I realize that this one was made to be lightweight and portable, not a powerhouse, so I am happy with the size and weight of the unit and feel like I could take it with me really anywhere, even in my purse or a backpack because it is so compact.<br /><br />I was able to fully charge my Samsung S5 three separate times before this ran out of &#34;juice&#34; and I have successfully jump-started a truck using it as well. Everyone that I have shown it to so far has been impressed! The unit itself charged very quickly - generally in under two hours from completely dead to a full charge.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those items that you don't think about until you need it and I am happy knowing that I have it for an emergency breakdown! Much less expensive than a call to AAA and safer than tracking down a stranger to give me a boost as a single woman out on her own mostly. I am excited to see what this company comes out with next!<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are derived from my own experiences!
B005M5WDBW|5|Perfect, worked great.  I have all windows again
B009E94XCO|2|For a diy weekend warrior project this was beyond my league and capability. I found it difficult to compress the spring or any other combination in order to fit for a reinstall of product. Not to mention the task of extra tools needed to complete job.(ball joint tool,which does damage, labeled on box. Spring compressor which is just a chore to operate with constant slippage and frustration.)  I would recommend some sort of instructions.
B00XKSA518|5|Perfect fix went right in.
B004SR7JVO|5|worked perfect
B009XIY22C|4|Lock works great,and looks good.My options were limited on places to mount one of these.This one seemed to do the trick
B00BMDYL1I|5|I'm pretty pleased with them. Came out nice and were easy to install. Seem sturdy enough.
B000C9SR90|5|Exact replacement
B002JFQFNA|5|Great sunglasses, looks badass. Comes with a nice soft bag. The hinges are a bit tight, a dab of oil made it better. Highly recommended.
B000IWLAEA|5|exact oem fit
B004YA2726|5|Excellent product and would buy from vendor again.
B005STXA64|5|We bought this set to use as a wheelchair ramp. We welded a spike in the center of each that fits into a hold at the end of the mobile clinic.
B00UVOGNPG|4|It fit but lock smith didn't cut right so didn't work. Beware where you take key to get cut
B004BTGLL8|5|Looked and fit just like the original, bolted and plugged right in... So far so good.
B004HCS4PK|5|Easy on and easy off. Great shine. I hope it lasts a long time. It get very good reviews.
B006X8CO7K|5|love it fit perfect lol
B009F4JHHO|5|For the price and what it does, it's awesome!!!  This little device along with my $5.99 Torque on Android helped me debug a pain in the ass intermittent problem on my 2009 BMW 528i (E60, N52).  Be able to do this and reporting back to my mechanic helped us nail what could have been a very costly problem otherwise.  Also knowing if you're emissions ready before you go get tested is nice too.  I highly recommend this device to anyone as successfully reading you engine light one time will pay for this device and whatever app you choose 10 to 30 times over!!!  For BMW drivers note you can't reset the engine light, code, or register your battery, but it will let you read all your control module sensors real time.  For me, I was zoning in on the OBD readiness, oxygen sensors (my problem) and fuel trim levels.  Also the coolant temperatures.  It's small profile also let me properly close the door and drive with it running, of which the data was invaluable to have!!!
B0044FX2P2|5|This purchase was to replace one that was damaged in a hail storm.
B00P6Y3PQ6|5|This was a great product for the money spent. as stated they ae not zippo and that is what i paid for, so that is what i got. i had to re-do the wix and i am having to fill the fluid every day. other than that and taking three or four strikes to light i am very happy
B00CFALFXY|4|no review these are christmas gifts
B008CSO2QK|5|Great product. High quality & commercial grade material. Like what you'd see a nursery suing. We're in Fresno and really needed the shade. I had also ordered a wrong size. They were great about my return. I'd definitely buy from them again and recommend them to others.
B000CAINEI|4|Only complaint
B00S78AVEM|1|Ordered the part, had an AC specialist put it in my car as per specs...bad part!!! Too much money to return as it cost me to put it in and will cost me to have it taken out...plus cost me $60 delivery and will cost me that much to return it...and that's all in US funds!!!
B00FJIT9BO|5|Another great product from Chemical Guys. Shines nice and not overly priced. Great product and I would recommend it. Try is yourself and you wont be disappointed.
B000FW2MWW|5|I like it as it lets me set our solar array on top of our motor home.
B00BJCN80M|1|Skip it. Low quality for the price.
B00N9AZSPK|5|excellent
B0068ODC1Q|5|It's awesome !!!!
B000WK6WAK|4|Nice!
B007J7E2O2|5|My husband loved these! He has a Nissan Altima and they look great!
B008KZKFLQ|5|These do fit a 2009 Hyundai Sonata perfectly, but the 2009 has only latch pin instead of two, no big deal.
B00MIJEOLM|5|If you can read this you are too close, caution! Great non offensive, the comment is my personal opinion, really like it.
B00GHT6SF4|4|Good quality replacement.  Only complaint is there are only 2 colors available from Dormon.. It was way darker than my dark Pewter..  The other option being light gray was equally as light in color as this one is dark..  I kept it though because through the dealer I am sure to match the color would cost me double what I paid for this.. And, if I look at it with a way to make it a good thing,  the color matches the color of my dash bezel and plastic... So I guess you could say it matches one of the colors in my cab.  Main thing is,, the lid works good, easy to install. Seems to be good enough quality.  The install literally took minutes..  tip the front seats back and slide the rod in..  I used a small but long bar clamp for wood working to squeeze the knurled end of the rod into the Hinge Hole instead of hammering on it.. Its a tight fit so be careful if you have to tap on it..
B0013IWQQ4|2|Not an exact fit for my '99 Volvo S70 as stated on the website. The mounting holes did not match up to my bracket. I was able to return it, but paid shipping to do so.
B000FIA11K|3|This works as a good replacement for older thermostats, however, due to the wiring differences, my husband had lo leave part of the old thermostat on to get it to work.
B00GYI1X3A|5|They fit my 2005 good.
B00XX63IAW|5|got it fast, just as ordered, no problems,took it right out to the van and clipped it in. worked flawlessly
B0014H6AA2|5|Not perfect but better than expected for the price
B00LHT4MAC|2|The product was fine, but didn't fit my car's armrest. I was unable to use it.
B00P67GSQC|3|Meh, it is okay, but they aren't my favorite scents by any means.  It was a good value, but I really don't care for either of them.
B004A9QOM0|1|Nevet sent my sticker.
B004W97R4M|5|I am very satisfied with the lights. The original harness plugged right in and they look great on my old truck.
B00DCCMUOC|5|Exactamente lo que andaba buscando
B003IOKPLO|4|Works really well to diagnose and reset codes.
B00MPXMLJS|5|had an issue where the I in zombie was missing contacted seller and had a replacement sent at no cost. Awesome color and looks great on my car .
B00FOOUP4S|5|Very good quality hose. I don't know how to let Amazon know that this definitely fits Subaru 2.5 L Boxer motor intake. Mine is a 2001 Outback and fit like a glove.
B0033BW06K|3|A bit loose
B000EDST1U|1|Dollar store item
B00HRHR3VI|5|It is amazing. Perfect quality that match our diamond edition 5th wheel.
B000BQMXEY|5|Great floor mat
B002ST0JNE|5|This cable is exactly what I was looking for. It plugged straight into the back of the head unit and I was able to connect up a bluetooth.
B000CIFGHM|5|Great product for limited slip differentials
B0002MABGE|3|Annoying. The bars are held up with tiny screws which trembled in wake of my German shepherd who laughed at my futility. She got her face between the window and the bars to let me know she would be doing whatever she feels like regardless of what I have to say about it. It did keep her in the back in conjunction with the K & H quilted cargo cover. Without the cover I am pretty sure she would've just knocked the whole thing down.
B00US4NHMG|1|These deer alert are worthless. They came off the first time I washed our vehicles. Poor adhesion!!!
B00URNQ126|5|These are very useful. Has worked well at keeping bags from tipping over and spilling
B0055AIKM0|5|Strong spring
B008Y3TUQK|5|No key to carry. Set to a code you already know
B003CJLH8K|5|works great
B002UC6R94|4|The Kwikee brand stairs on my 2004 motorhome were replaced in 20013 due to an accident. They were replaced with Stromberg Carlson stairs.<br />Those stairs only lasted 1.5 years before a gear shaft broke. That shaft was welded in place and could not be repaired. I was limited in time and replaced the broken stairs with the same model. I hope these last more than 1.5 years.
B00Y3SOMV8|5|Sturdy and easy to install.  Looks great!
B000CODS80|1|Bought two and both broke without removing windshield wiper arm.
B000FFNB3S|5|Well made!  Fits well! This item will keep my carpet clean.
B001V8U12M|5|good quailty, better than digging in tool box for extra socket and a hex driver to put in the drill.
B00JE7RI5U|4|Product was just as advertised!
B00AR2R090|5|great value
B00V58PLSW|2|These Winjet lights look awesome. The only problem is that they don't have a built in resistor for the LED turn signals. I think a $350 product should work properly out of the box without having to purchase separate resistors.
B001NZKYJI|4|works well
B00IO9CVJ2|5|Amazing product!! I have just installed and it looks awesome!!
B00QEP3NWW|5|as described. perfect fit
B00B9F2QBQ|1|Dosnt fit like oem...
B008UOLOB2|5|Awesome product!<br />Lives up to what it says it can do!
B0054YE8AU|5|Great, does the job. Some people say it gets tangled but the solution is to remove the hooks until after covering the load. It will make it a lot easier to manage! Install hooks accordingly to where and how much it is necessary.
B007V5BL96|5|it fit perfect on my 2009 toyota hylander.
B00NEL6HK4|1|It's soaked in oil that smells and once you put it in the cabin will smell. Used it for 3-4 weeks, the oil stink from the cabin never went away, seems like it even got worse over time, it stunk when the air blower was on or off. Got rid of it and went with OEM - no more oil smell from the cabin.
B001D20X4W|5|it fit perfectly
B00F1RUCWI|5|GOOD STUFF
B0040CW2A0|3|for some reason did not fit holes on passenger
B004LX3AS6|5|Charges my motorcycle battery right up.
B00S1DWE66|3|This is not for the 2015 Honda Fit, even if it says it'll fit.
B00KQ81M94|5|great product at a great price. the care and concern from the customer service team is the best I have personally experienced.
B00JRHI1LM|5|Very comfortable,used for about 2wks. 100 percent happy
B00BCRM9YA|4|Fabric could have been better
B000IXTGHW|1|Horrible.  Hardly any airflow when heating.
B0049L8GEI|2|I put these on and had trouble with severe pulsations for weeks. I finally gave up and went to a brake shop. They were out of tolerance when new and needed turning! The shop turned them and reinstalled them. They were fine after that. In defense of this product, the shop guy said they turn all of their rotors and drums before they install them, to prevent customer complaints. He said over 90% of rotors and drums are &#34;out of round&#34; from the factory now.
B00LBU662Y|5|Perfect for my husband to wear in his motocross boots. Not too thick. He likes these much better than his thick socks.
B003M4OAY8|5|good
B009UOO6R0|5|Just what I was looking for.
B005KSR3MU|3|This is a solid product, but don't expect the perfect 100% custom fit as the company claims.<br />I have noticeable gaps where the mat fits my Acura along the gas release lever on the driver-side floor.  this is odd considering the company goes out of its way to explain on their site about the proprietary cutting matching process to make these an absolute perfect fit for my exact car model. These are small imperfections, the mats do fit well, but considering their advertising I was expecting perfection and no gaps since the company apparently took the time to custom mold and match my exact car model.<br />Also the rear mat has curled along the edge for no reason. I contacted customer service through their website and got quite a snippy one sentence reply that I need to contact the actual seller since I didn't purchase direct from them. Wow.<br /><br />Still, the product is tough and looks great and considering the alternatives, you're probably not left with other options. But for the high price and the way the product is marketed it should be a near perfect, flaw-free fit which it is not. Close, but not perfect.<br />Also their customer service reps could use some training.
B00C0SQ8KG|3|Bright? Check. Affordable? Check. Easy install? Check. Moisture inside the Lena like the other reviews? Check?
B003UE2OWA|5|First time using clay bars.  These have the stiffness similar to Bit of Honey taffy candy bars, which is rather stiff. I plan to use these annually when I do the truckers in the spring.
B00YSQ5JA8|5|Needed something for my new car-has really uncomfortable seats. This really did the trick!
B00I8SIIO6|5|Love this muffler sounds great ,super easy to install ..... Get it😀😀😀😀😀
B00NC7VU4I|5|Exact fit
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great!
B00ZJJN2VQ|3|Good & easy to wear gloves.
B00T7GYAWW|5|Seems like a high quality light and puts out a ton of light.  Mounted on the hood of my Jeep Wrangler and am very happy with it.
B000LG5MN8|5|Very happy with this exhaust. Nice deep tone, but not obnoxious. Fit well on my Durango.
B00PYZAAPG|5|It is a beautiful keychain. Very sturdy and great quality! I've had several people comment on how it caught their eye.
B00YBGAU2W|5|Can't go wrong with the chairs and trays!
B00JVIIMGG|5|This decal looks just like the picture and shipped quickly.  Plus, it came with an additional decal of a cat, which is subtle enough to put on my husband's truck.  Could not be more pleased with this purchase!
B005VLX6NG|5|perfect
B00BJ9J7V4|2|Didn't last as long as I thought it would for the money but def. One.of the better smelling.ones
B00DYVSHXY|5|love these
B000T9YO5E|5|Does its job, not rusted, very happy
B00WTLI10Y|4|This is a really slick hookup for a light bar. Very easy hookup, good looking harness with plenty of wire for installation.<br />Would have been better if it came with 2 remote switches or the remote code.
B00GUA6Z76|5|A+!  Fit like a champ!
B0006302KE|5|5***** for the product, but only &#34;one&#34; for the product seal; (there isn't one); No seal under the cap so in shipping the wax can very easily leak out and into the plastic bag that it's shipped in as my first order did. TURTLE WAX needs to address this short coming!  db
B00DDOSSLS|5|Works perfectly to replace the bulbs in my RV.  Price was good, quality is good.
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Great.
B00YB20U9E|3|Ok, but poorly finished and no nut
B000C9MPZW|2|I purchased this u joint because it was described as fitting the front drive shaft on my 76 Ford F150 4x4. I thought that all of the u joints were the same. Well, as it turns out, they are. The problem with this one, is, that it is NOT made in the USA. It is made in Mexico. Now that I know for sure that the same U joint fits all locations on my truck, I will stick with the Dan Spicer U Joint, which Is, made in the USA. My truck was made by, paid for, and driven by a US citizen. I want to keep everything, as much as possible, made in the USA. As a consumer you are paying very little less for this Mexican stuff, you can see,  only the corporation and their stockholders benefitted from this product.
B000C2WF9A|5|Drilled a little hole in the handle portion to insert the tether so it is like the original. Works great. Prevents those &#34;opportunist&#34; thieves from stealing gas easily.
B00ED42CSC|5|Very good
B00P8FG2Z4|2|I loved it when I received it, but less than a month later it has almost completely faded and has a hole. Definitely not high quality....Less than one year and it is faded completely white and is leaving white flakes all over my car!! Just not worth the time, money, or mess!
B0046VU3SI|5|Great Product and service
B00AQ29G4I|1|They came off first week, and made my tire flat twice!
B006BARHFY|5|Perfect replacement.  Looks exactly like the original.  Range is great, instructions for setup were clear.
B002EC9MFG|5|Perfect fit for a 2005 Acura TSX.  It's the exact specs as the OEM belt.  No noise or fitment issues.  This is the best bang for your bucks.  Only suggestion to make your life easier with the installation would be to buy or rent a serpentine belt removal tool.
B0009H51PI|5|It fits the application
B00N4MXV0M|5|I just received this El wire and it's great I never knew 5.0 MM could be so thick and big I should have know that lol I'm happy looks great on my bike =D
B004O7DBM4|5|Works GREAT. Now I can see the area while approaching my RV at night. No more stumbling over obstacles and falling!!
B0016VAIBI|5|only way i could have finished my project
B003HLDWEK|5|Perfect replacement for our Dodge Ram pickup with 318 cu.in. engine. Well made, easy install, low cost -- a perfect combination to get the truck up and running on the hottest days or the coldest nights.
B004KCVR06|1|Anti theft screws are too large for the holes in the stems. It almost appears as if the chrome dip filled in the holes and they were not re-tapped. Too bad because they look like they would be really nice.
B00ISGE53G|5|Definitely the best steering wheel cover out there imho.  Love the grip.  It looks sleek and fits great.  I kept having crummy wheel covers from AutoZone fall apart on me, this one looks like it will definitely last.
B00E6A5M4O|1|To small for the price
B00CZEZNGU|4|Replaced a few old single incandescent RV bulb units in my utility trailer with these. While they're cheap plastic, the increase in light output for the cost of LED units nice. Easy to install, too. Bought a few more just to increase light output in my trailer.
B00WF5THCA|2|I use them to block the sun in my work truck. Easy to place anywhere on the window and the suction cups work fine. Works as expected. Not bad for the price.  Update-Two weeks after using them, the grommet in the center that holds the suction cup in place pulled away from the mesh and now they're worthless.
B00X11N2OQ|5|I love them soft leather but i bought them to work in and thought they would not last but they holding up pretty well yet they are soft and flexable leather thet fit wonderfully
B00157SXQA|4|They arrived when they were scheduled and are working as described.
B000GASX9O|5|Much better than the converter that came with my trailer
B002SAUY74|5|Price is right and perfect fit for my Corolla S.
B000BWCFT6|3|Not the best and not the worst. Would not buy again because the width is a little narrow.
B0038B4AQI|4|will work as advertised
B00OZ6UJ24|2|cheap
B004AHC322|1|made in taiwan,  sellout
B00KFPDLZQ|5|Great quality, very bright, and white, exactly what I paid for, will be buying from them again.
B00KB49YMK|5|Just what I was looking for but would have liked a back plate with it for extra support.  Very nice looking.
B005RZBS5E|5|Fit like a glove😁
B000NDH610|5|Was what I ordered and works good.
B00M1OUBES|5|Really Amazing thing .. Tried many times to junpstart my and frnds car during offroading trips<br />My mobile is always charged .. Five star 👍
B00LTX847I|5|This product arrived quicker than expected and in perfect condition.  The direction of the cord makes it perfect to plug in to tight spaces without bending and damaging the cord.
B00LFL8JBA|5|Was extremely pleased with the price. The pennies to add the entire hub to the job were well worth it, just as a preventive.<br /><br />Parts looked identical to those used. I vacillated on the Timkin parts, but the car, honestly, wasn’t worth them. The vehicle had<br />sustained some front end damage before I bought it (not reported to CarFax) and I pushed the old parts 20,000 miles.  I was lucky,<br />though nothing was visibly wrong with the old parts (I had thoughts of a friction fire that caught the tire and/or seizing and breaking clean of the car), the car is now so silent that I can hear the fan on low. Previously, I could barely hear it on high.<br /><br />Be prepared and get the lower ball joint and tie rod end for a few bucks more and get the entire job done.  I wish I had had them at that moment.  If you know you need them (have play in the side to side motion of wheel when grabbed at 3 and 9 o’clock, when on a jack or in the air) get it done.<br /><br />It’s probably cheaper to get it done with THIS kind of labor than it is to do with along with an alignment.
B00VX8I474|5|I get a lot of positive comments when people passing by my car read this.
B00DJ5KE9A|4|Just what I wanted.  Works great.
B002MPONEA|5|Great product very fast delivery
B00JBNYYQ8|5|Did a much better job than I expected!  My Saturn was sideswiped a few times, and this product got rid of the majority of the scratches, and paint transfer.
B008EEIER0|1|Started peeling off after 4 days.  I didn't expect much,  but I expected it to actually sick to my car.
B0009V1WS4|5|Works great!
B003CQV8FA|5|WORKS WELL
B00529CVS8|5|I'm refitting a 20 year old boat. Tools like these are such a time saver. I am using this to take off most of the Tridon hose clamps and then refit them. The flex arm is extremely helpful on a boat and it is of such a long length that it allows me to get to places i could not access before. I was using a flat head screw driver prior to this and wasting a lot of time. Do yourself a favor and let the tools help you!
B009WVSAXC|5|This company makes a very good replica decals, I have purchased 3 different styles
B007H2RR78|5|This is the perfect hose, the only down fall it wont fit in the bumper like the others
B00O4CPFB4|5|Just as expected
B00BGSFJM4|5|nicely priced
B00VJUN5ZM|5|very bright, easy to installed.
B00515NJTI|5|Car was running lousy, and got to the point where I thought it was going to die. I didn't realise it was the spark plugs. Runs great now, and smooth, so I can pin point anything else that may need addressing. Worth the price, because might outlast the car.
B00L7TM9Z2|5|My Chevy brakes like a new one... What a great deal for Brembo's! Love Them!
B002ATI3JE|5|Had another pair from a different place, but lost the smoke lens.  Was very glad to find this replacement that my prescription insert fits right into.
B009IYV0JO|5|Great product. Easy install.
B000GZBZOE|5|Very satisfied
B00XQN37P8|2|To start off this would be my 3rd set for my cars and this one was for !y genesis which it said it was compatible with which it wasn't it did not fit right other then that the company's kits are spot on...
B000C59LWQ|5|Definitely improves our ride!!  So happy we replaced the factory shocks!!  We have a 31' 2009 Coachmen Freelander.

B0002U2V1O|3|Very good!
B00GR2W0PI|4|a good decal will last awhile not perfect but I put it on my Harley without a second thought.
B00G24610Q|1|However the box is labeled as &#34;Stem Caps for Audi&#34;, the caps and keychain says &#34;Jeep&#34;. I'm really amazed that something as easy as this gets miss labeled. For the price I paid, I'm just going to throw them away.
B001QVA25U|1|Not as shown nor advertised.  Boot is not black, but is a blue color.  Has grease fittings, the one shown in the add does not.  Boot does not come with Grease, will require one to purchase a grease gun and grease.  Bought before and it was not this way.  Disappointed.
B0019WNXG6|2|Bulb's lasted 7 months.  I really like them but I thought they would last me a year.
B00KNNPYPK|5|Fit great and easy to install.

B000BZG8ZU|5|Excelent
B0048FWGSC|1|Was wrong one.
B000Q073CM|5|good band
B00C7B22VK|3|i bought 3 of them and  1 came in damaged and had no assistance in being able to return it. the reason it was damaged was because of a quality difference. 2 of them were fine and one was different color, different hardware and different quality. wish I had more help in returning this poor quality pan.
B003RWIAW8|5|Great Awesome
B00409DJD2|5|Man are you serious? You leave a product a bad review because even though it is CLEARLY labeled to be for an Audi A4 it didnt fit your golf?<br />First off the aidi is a B platform and your golf is a Mk4 Second the audi is longitudinal motor yours is transverse. Why in the worl wiuld you expect the oiping to be the same? I dont have this product so i dont know the quality, but dont give a product bad rep just because you dont do your research before you hit &#34;buy&#34;
B00O1D182G|5|Great item
B00BTLEHSK|1|I received my order very timely no issue there.  I finally installed the seat covers on Sunday, this is where the disappointmen starts.  I have a 2008 Saturn Vue.  I checked that the seat covers would fit before making this purchase.  Unless seats are like people and put on extra pounds over the years, the front covers started busting at the seams while trying to slide down the front seats.  The don't go all the way down, so when you do sit, you feel the pull.  Could not remove head rest (according to owners manual - they are not designed to be removed).  Now for the back seat, seat belts look like they come up through the seat, so no way to zip all the way up.  The middle seat belt is made into the seat, so no way to remove.  Yes, we also watched the video, looks like they used a car not a SUV. I am keeping, main objective is to protect the seats from further damage from the nephews and niece.
B0074A8FXS|4|Work fine
B00C43BNES|5|great oil at a great price!!!
B00K53DSZ6|5|good battery fast service and good price
B00GW3E7C6|2|Didn't have a good picture of it to know that you had to remove the headrest in order to attach it. I wanted it for bus trips so now I'm having to make alterations to it in order for it to work
B00BMGU35I|5|arrived as ordered excellent little sticker!
B000BUQOEU|5|Works great! Highly recommended
B004GFTC0E|5|Great product, brought my head lights back to life

B000GQ6LF6|5|product as described, no issues, great seller
B002WH7ARK|5|excellent.  perfect fit.
B00BITR12M|5|Fit perfectly. Good price.
B00I15C5IG|5|I have not tried the other cup holders available for C5's, so I cannot compare it to those.  I did, however, through much internet research come to find that this was the most recommended cup holder available.  That said, this piece works very well.  I bought this soon after I purchased my C5 before driving the car on a 1,200 mile roadtrip.  It fits securely under the center console trim and is held in place fairly firmly with the carpet.  I have the cup holder on the passenger side and found it did not obstruct the legroom too terribly.  Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B000BGOI10|5|fits like a glove, or a tail light lens.
B007JSGR9Y|5|For the about $20 price point, works great, reads and clears codes.
B00TH2EJ72|5|This rope works prefect and is super tough. I used this to replace my winch cable on my SXS and looks good and very durable. I would suggest this if you want to replace your cable with Synthetic Rope.
B00GHTEK18|1|I live in the Bahamas. I ordered this part it came very quick. Installed it and it doesn't work, I'm very disappointed
B003YOMK0M|5|Installed both front and rear with the same &#34;ThermoQuiet&#34; pads. It's been a month now since this review and I am very satisfied with this product. It is indeed quiet. The best money I've spent on my vehicle! Now that my pads are new and thick, my braking experience is now smoother, quieter, and more sensitive. 2009 Toyota Venza V6.
B001FMPP8O|5|Fast service and a great price
B00008BKX5|5|works perfect
B0074BR1UA|5|EXCELENTE
B009K7N7DG|5|Excellent
B000C7VZ8W|5|Installed myself the product is sent with alot of information and so far it's working great
B005OVBYH8|5|The job was completed and my long term fuel trims went from -16 to -\+ 3 on bank 1&2. The part fixed my rich conditions on both banks. Very satisfied with AC Delco Product.
B004GC8DPC|5|Everything was perfect, my brother installed it and had no problems.  This is the way to go.
B0055FFMGM|3|i didnt know there was six of them...only got 5......the one with the skulls wasnt in it
B00BH0K67E|5|Very nice!I couldn't wait to put these on once I got them.
B000BLNTQU|1|Its supposed to fit a Versa!!! and its not the right product  ....
B007JY0ETW|5|Looks cool has 7 colors and shifts from color to color in 2 settings. Flashing colors or slowly shifting. It's a great gauge. Doesn't read vacuum but reads boost very well and read easily
B0041LN1L4|5|It's very useful  products
B0002Q80GS|5|easy to connect
B002J8UPO2|5|excellent
B001VD5NPM|5|Best Trailor light Kit Ever, bought for my 26 foot sail boat trailer install was a sinch completed in less than an hour. They are quite bright and easy to maintain.
B003CMWC4U|1|didn't fit the carb I wanted it for. didn't know D and single D where different.
B00067BX5I|5|Easy to replace, only problem was that the lens had a blue tint when the ad stated it was clear,
B008Y4HM6E|5|Good stock air filter.  No complaints at all.
B00OCHZBVA|3|Vendor contacted me with a set of instructions.  The First two lines were wrong-- &#34;The Red wire: connects the anode of the storage battery. The Black wire: connect the cathode of the storage battery&#34; Then there were references to &#34;electric doors&#34; and &#34;flameout cables&#34;, as well as &#34;forward start cable&#34;. In my opinion, only an experienced installer should attempt this installation.  Update: received schematic. Picture attached below. Now looking for the &#34;Electric Locomotive Leading&#34;,  the &#34;Leading Apositively Charged&#34;, and two wires labeled &#34;The Direction of Light&#34; But my motorcycle doesn't have the gray wire, and I certainly wouldn't cut it!.  My opinion is unchanged, but the documentation is at least humorous.  I changed to 3-stars, but only if you are experienced at this sort of thing.  10-13 edit. I changed the attachment to a better pic of the diagram.  My opinion is unchanged.
B001FCBEA2|5|The Stowaway is exactly what I expected.  It works great to keep the stone guard up off the ground and organized while we are at a campground.  Best of all it wad delivered within a couple days with Prime.
B00FOX5KEY|5|These are the right product to use when installing HID on any 2012  Dodge Ram 1500 with quad head lights,if your Low beam HID flickers when you turn them on is because the truck automatic head lights use low voltage,you need to run the HID directly to the 12 volt battery using the relay harness witch comes with a 50w resistor,make sure you don't attach the resistor to anything that's plastic because it gets hat only metal surface.
B000S2UFXC|5|Purchased as a backup.  The price was right.
B006662U1E|5|this one works, the knockoffs do not.  For this part stick with OEM.
B009YMZD66|5|Looks good on a computer, as advertised.
B00612V4P6|4|I really like this Toyota Stainless Steel tag, looks great on my Toyota!
B00HZOC42Q|2|They are ok but not that good that price
B000CMFHLI|5|Happy, Happy Thanks A+++++++
B007USCMD8|5|To my surprise it works perfectly and it blows freezing cold air, the JEEP dealer wanted to charge me $167.00.
B004R6GAPM|4|Great plastic fix.
B00DSD4M7I|3|Liked it but after a while the sun faded the red out. I would look for a different Stones sticker. I have a hot pink Rush sticker and it has NOT faded. I think the reason one has faded and the other one hasn't is because of the stickers material.
B001PWFPRU|5|Awesome addition,  now ladies can open the tailgate w/out saying ouch.
B00KTIUID2|4|Like the product
B00383F7V8|5|Kept me dry in Sturgis
B00NTYTJ8I|1|I need to return this item as 1 of them will not screw onto my tire
B008J151H4|2|Not as loud as you may think it is. Almost the same volume if not a bit less than factory horn. Do not recommend.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|I needed a jumbo sunshade due to getting a new car so I tried this one & it's great! It covers the entire windshield, stays in place, is nice & lightweight & really nice that it folds up into a small lightweight case. Takes up a lot less room in your car than the accordion sunshades. Love this sunshade. Would do business with this seller again.
B00P2VWSE8|4|The motor isn't nearly as strong or quiet as OEM parts but it fits and works well.  Fairly easy to install.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|Got this for my wife who loses everything. NOT ANYMORE!!!! Great tool for the $$.
B000CN7JQS|5|Looks great and functions well
B004FOM86Q|5|These straps work great. I already have a set, for over a year now, and decided to buy more.  Love them.
B003ZWXIAO|5|It was way cheaper then at JEGS..my husband was so happy at the price..worked perfectly with his project
B000IYR46G|5|just right for my cruiser
B00B1AKQAW|1|Terrible Do Not Buy, Adhesive is poor windows will not go up without hitting visors....
B00W1BZJPW|2|Item didn't work but Man Friday took care of problem immediately, courteously and satisfactorily.
B003YJCDLS|5|My husband installed these quickly under the dining table in our RV, with no issues, right after they arrived (early, I might add!).  We are full-time RVers and I use the dining table daily for my computer work as well as my hobbies (painting, working on my photography, etc.), so it's helpful to have two drawers to store items in.  I also store my glasses/sunglasses/lip balm in the drawers, which I use daily, whether around the RV or out on my bike rides or swimming.
B00KPF3CCS|5|Finally getting a chance to write a review for these lights now that they have been on my truck for a few months. I will say I love them. They are bright and look great. I will mention anyone buying these should buy a toggle style switch and prefab wire harness for lights as it will come with the inline fuses and all that you need to install these correctly.  These additional items I found on Amazon too. As a side note, I received a defective one and the company was quick to offer a no charge replacement, paid for shipping and it was all hassle free. Thank you!!
B00M1N5UOK|5|EXECELENTE
B00BYRO1EY|5|The pads fit great on a 2005 Equinox. I've been driving on them for a few months and no issues.
B001L9KI56|5|Easy to install and works as advertised.
B005XN23P4|5|Love this jacket! It fits very well, it's comfortable, and looks great.
B00KM7AKK6|5|As advertised. Not difficult to install. Be sure to lookup (youtube) where to prey the end covers from.
B00IWO4K8O|5|Great!
B00NUXSQBY|4|Works great, smooth opperations with the addition of a washer inwhere  the lever is bolted in.
B000C55MVU|5|Works very good on my off road truck. AAAAAA+++++++
B0026CG5S6|5|I got these for my 2013 F150 Crew Cab, being a little apprehensive about the auto up feature on the front windows causing problems. They were very easy to install, taking more time to get them unpackaged and ready to install than the actual install. After I got them installed the auto up feature on the front windows was a little hard to work with, although when I finally got them up I left them there for a few days. Then they worked fine. I guess they had to get 'set' into the channel.<br />The shades arrived with one clip missing. I called the 800 number for Lund International and they sent two clips to me that I received in a couple of days. A week later I received a call from them wanting to know if I received the clips and if everything was working fine.<br />EXCELLANT product from a great company that backs up what they sell. HIGHLY recommended!
B00BITIOR8|5|Looks good.
B00UMOGJ9U|5|GOOFIT Carburetor w/ Gasket is a top quality product and has been working well with my  Go Kart. I was looking for a good quality carburetor for my Go Kart and am very happy that I bought this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good carburetor for their Go Kart.
B00FNJ8YKG|1|Sorry to say it but this thing is terribale
B009408LLC|1|not worth the money.  get a cardbord box
B00LM55POS|5|This is my favorite scent, but very hard to find.
B000EQ0LEK|5|Delivered on time. Didn't notice any difference in performance, but was doing a tune-up on my 93' Jeep Grand Cherokee so I replaced with this. It's been 32 or three months and no problems.
B00192JGN0|4|Good Product!
B00RY3RE3M|4|First sticker I bought went on fine. The second sticker started to tear in a few places but still managed to come out okay
B00FMV0WFA|5|Perfect fit, much easier to store and organize items in my huge console.  As everyone else says, how dare GMC not include this with a 40k truck.  Oh well, just buy it you'll be happier.
B000C1B3NK|5|works great. had a hard time finding this in shop. its gotta have the five prongs for me, which it does.
B000W0KTMW|5|havent used it yet but I carry it under my seat, seems to be very good quality and key has a light to see lock at  night, NICE..........
B000GZBZOE|4|The price was right. Installation was easy. They look good and are very functional. They were a little darker than I had hoped.
B00Y81P6EW|4|This is exactly what you expect from the Chinese knockoff of the genuine product. It took me about 4 hours to install. The directions were terrible, some of the hardware didint fit and I had to make a couple trip to Home Depot. In the end I saved about $1k over the genuine product and this looks 95% as good.
B00D6DOFTK|1|POS! doesn't work and no response from the seller. Save your money and but something that is reliable froma seller that provedes some support. If I could give 0 stars I would have. This one went to the round file!
B002MPVK46|4|Love. Fits great. A little noisy
B001AWLTX4|4|Well made , would buy again .
B00KDD3YKW|5|Great product
B00CITW3YW|4|They fit great and look good but didn't give it 5 because the material is not an even black color but looks kind of stained or somewhat discolored. No a deal breaker but could be better. Also, the driver mat (being the most used) has scratched a lot and is starting to look worn in just a few weeks.
B00H93V5VY|5|Used it to cover up rip in my dash board. The self sticking glue will not hold the emblem flat unless the surface is completely flat. My dash has a slight curve in the spot where  I put it, so I had to use super glue to get the edges flat top the surface.
B00JA80PEO|5|I haven't tried the intercom feature yet but the Bluetooth music through my phone and radio features work great.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
B000CO7Q6U|5|Great tool , used today , well made another  Great tool at great price from Amazon , The BEST<br />RELIABLE AND NO LEAKS FROM VALVE
B00H2VVQNU|5|Worked well!
B001DRN9JS|5|Great Price - Quick Shipping
B000EEU0IO|1|The only car seat this would fit over is an old WWII Jeep.  It may work on a VW built before 1945.  It is way too small for any modern vehicle.  I was disappointed.
B0039001TI|4|The right stuff for the right price
B003YK44FA|2|Buyer beware. This item was just as advertised and I liked it. My poor review is based on their customer service. They do not sell replacement parts. I damaged the &#34;linkage assembly&#34; when backing up (my fault) and customer service told me I have to buy the entire product again. They do not sell replacement parts despite what it says on the &#34;contact&#34; page on their website. For me no parts means a deal breaker. I will not be buying another one to replace my broken one, at least not from this company.<br /><br />Also if anyone was wondering on a 2008 F-250 this item sticks out past the bumper and can be damaged when backing a trailer.
B000BNUEPC|5|Everything you need!!
B00AKFISW2|4|Work great just cheezy switch
B000HBNTX2|5|This soap is amazing! I purchased it for my husband because he is always working on cars and can never get all of the oil off of his hands. This and snap on soap is the only stuff that works and fast orange is a lot more cost effective. I will continue to buy this product. It also has a great smell which is an added bonus
B0055DMVRM|5|Worked exactly as I wanted and helped maximize space in the cargo trailer.
B00KNMKRU8|5|Love it keeps my battery charged
B00C5SVTOG|5|Delivered as promised
B00LY9HKUE|5|I have this decal on both of my vehicles. Love it !!
B00OMT6UEK|5|use all the time good.
B005HQK3VS|4|Worked as advertised.
B001QDHTOK|5|What can I say....it's the Grateful Dead. Love it.
B00JKSSXFM|5|Good items all fit perfectly on my 07 Honda Civic si.
B00Y28JHQ4|5|WORKS GREAT!!!  I bought this dirt bike carrier to haul my Honda 250 on the back of my Chevy Tahoe and it WORKED GREAT!!!  Easy to load and strap.  The free loading ramp stored underneath the carrier and was easy to use.  The baskets made it great to carry gas cans and my ice chest.  No more need to carry my gas cans inside my truck.  It is made of heavy duty steel and built well to support my dirt bike.  I used it to take my bike to the desert over the weekend with no problems.  The 3D assembly instructions made it easy to assemble. All of my friends also liked the motorcycle carrier with storage basket and have since bought these carriers over the weekend.  I will definitely recommend this product.  Great job WMA!!
B00CVFIJ0U|5|As cute as I thought
B00BVL7M26|5|Seriously this stripper is fantastic. I don't imagine it would work well with large-gauge wires, but for every day basic use this thing is makes it super easy. Because it is a &#34;front entry&#34; stripper it can be used in tight places where other types of strippers simply won't work. I love this thing.
B0094E5IWI|4|As described, fits by sand blaster properly. Just ensure you order the size that fits your blaster.
B004JBYW7S|5|Fit my 2000 Honda Civic just like OEM.  Easy to install.  Plenty of youtube videos to give you tips.
B00T3G6Q6E|5|Love the service and the product.
B001C4OB8U|5|Horsepower is up and so is gas mileage.
B0060NJT1C|5|This product seems to be super high quality. It came super fast, more than a week less than Amazon promised. It also has a great personal touch. It is sold directly by the artist and includes a handwritten note thanking you by name (well the name on your account) for your purchase as well as miniature versions of the product, directions on multiple applications, and a link for a video of application process, which was super easy. I was debating on getting a few different cheaper options, but I would definitely recommend spending the couple extra dollars on this one!
B003QQ06XG|5|The starter works very well haven't had any problem with it thank you so much
B005WXNF7K|5|This cover fit the van perfectly.
B00825Z71M|5|Well satisfied
B000C848Q2|5|Works great, used it in an inline thermostat conversion using a Meziere inline housing
B00REZ9CHQ|4|good
B001G7LLOA|5|Item as described.  Thanks!
B0049C6CE8|5|The springs fit perfectly
B007H2RR78|4|Bought it with the 15' kit and so far it's been great
B003G0KO6G|5|Fit is almost perfect, no complaints here
B001DRHMPK|5|This filter fit perfectly and as far as I can tell thus far has been doing it's job properly.
B00QQ62F3C|5|Met my expectations and a nice addition to an old CRV
B00BN44SXW|4|Good item.
B008QBUDZM|2|It's a cute little cover and it seems durable enough, however it left purple fuzz everywhere. It sticks to your clothes, the car... everything.
B00DPRTDXU|5|I,M satisfied with my purchase of the rear seat cowl. looks really good on my motorcycle. Thanks.
B00U8O69AS|5|It works, would have been out of business without it/ works fine and is a great deal compared to auto repair stores !
B0045MX9C0|5|Durable and reliable. I bought this product a few months ago and it survived the very rainy July we had this year!
B007QWDUHA|5|👍we love it<br />It arrived early
B00C1YI2XA|4|Much brighter than I had expected them to be! Good two-sided tape included with and they are very low profile. I've mounted them as exterior work lights on my truck and at night they will clearly illuminate at least 30' off in the distance. My only consideration in terms of durability is how small the wires are. Even using the cutting side of the strippers and gently sliding will sometimes break through the core of them.
B00Q2NZ6LC|5|awesome
B00BKPJ3IO|5|Soft strong material, has a super liner that you can take off and wash I'm left handed so before my elbow would hurt on long drives now it doesn't
B00B0Q5M7Y|3|It is kind of awkward for me.  The handle is a little large.
B009DJPYDC|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B002NF118A|5|PERFECT MATCH
B001LA1DZO|5|BABY!!!!!  xxx
B007X4TU0W|5|Excellent product.
B009EVP4ZW|5|This is a nice lockable box.  Seems sturdy and good value for the money.  Bought one for both sides.
B001DR9Z14|5|What a huge difference in power !  At first the vehicle (Chevy Uplander) seemed to run a bit sluggish, you can feel it sort of skipping as you press on the pedal. After having the ignition coil replaced and adding new spark plugs and wires you can definitely tell the difference, lots of power !<br />I highly recommend it !
B00WY9H6H0|5|This is a hard to find decal. Looks great perfect size
B003GCWDF4|2|does not seem to work, penetration oil did better.
B000HBM45Q|5|Good Price
B000R5OIB0|5|just what we thought they were
B010H0QV7S|5|I had reviewed the DBPower car charger battery, and they asked if I wanted to review this car tool also. It was something I wanted to get already, because I wanted a glass breaker and seat belt cutter for my car in case of an emergency. Sure it is likely you will go your whole life and never need those emergency tools, but it also comes with a digital tire gauge and flash light, both torch style, plus red LED.<br /><br />The product does seem like a generic product, but I am ok with that considering it seems sturdy and good quality. The plastic is ok, and for only $13 I wouldn't expect metal or anything of higher durability. It seems like a fair price.<br /><br />Check out my video review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGif9J2gZMc for more information and a demonstration on how it works.
B00BYNJ7HY|5|Like a new Truck
B002M91BRI|5|Fit my car perfectly
B00897C504|5|perfect fit
B0007M1FM8|5|Just what I needed to extend my bike rack to clear my spare tire in my jeep
B004XMBXRU|5|This worked out wonderfully. Arrived quickly. Assembled easily, and is working wonderfully. Thanks so much.
B00DJFRD2G|5|Perfect.
B000IYLK02|1|It didn't fit like it should have so i had to buy another part
B000VJPULY|5|This stuff is great! very happy with the oil so far. will update if it changes!
B009DJV1GQ|4|piece fit nicely on my 2005 f150, after paint job it looks great.
B00SF3KNLA|5|Nicely made, even has a bit of weight to it but not too heavy.
B00378KAFC|5|Fits perfectly & made of quality materials.
B008DMCUE6|5|A++++++
B009FNWHXG|5|Nice item and good price
B0052FRFDI|5|Exact match
B00EBY83CI|3|I have one offroad ride on this glove. The glove looks kind of rough after just one ride. I hope it holds up as it is very pricey glove and I think there are better values out there. Time will tell the story.  I feel like it runs a bit on the small side.  Maybe I should have gone with the XXl.
B003YL15V0|2|I really wasn't expecting such a low quality product, it's just incredibly flimsy. The lamp, however, could prove worthy sometime.
B007WHXI9E|4|Not much to say other than it looks as described, is pretty solid.  I like the capability of holding a pipe or cigars.
B0002M9UTS|3|ok
B000N2WB2U|5|Simple plug and play. Performs as it is suppose to. Highly recommend for Rail Buggys and VW's
B00HJB85G4|5|Really good
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Really enjoy this. My son out it on the mower and it works well
B008VE6XRQ|5|Perfect!
B00KHNT1H8|5|These look great. OEM one fell out and replaced with these.
B00MALO58A|5|I repainted but exelent product
B00CM589B8|4|good
B00DQJ8T00|5|As advertised.<br />Granted some reception is lost from distant stations but satellite radio negates that.<br />Local channel reception is not affected.<br />Looks better than original chrome whip.
B00DN7QQ1O|3|Flame jets out like it's upright cigar lighting brethren, which is great for cigar lighting.
B00ONDLVL2|4|Nice lights, does not come with wire harness.
B0002Q7C1C|5|Works well, just had to splice the ground wires together as others have discussed.  Worked well with our camper.
B007IU1JJG|1|The engine will not operate over 2,000 rpm with covers on. there no holes or screen for air intake!!! pretty unless.
B008LPVX8E|5|Great suckers just like the picture!
B00QW3FJZU|5|Great product, fast delivery, just as described.
B00GBBE580|5|EXECELENTE
B00IT5LRQE|5|looks awesome
B005CW9RL4|5|Came in a timely fashion and worked perfectly.
B000CIL5TK|5|Cannot find yjis in stores anymore.  It is absolutely the best for any stains on car seats and carpet.  I would highly recommend this!
B003BZIN1O|2|did not fit even though it was for my automobile returned to amazon
B00189BJHA|5|Great for my 09 jeep. Sound quality very clear doesn't change or damper the speakers. No leaks found. Overall excellent product and easy to install.
B001C6Q7GC|1|Same story that the user &#34;J&#34; mentioned happened to me. Within about 1200 miles the shaft bent and started grinding the pulley against the power steering pump. DO NOT BUY! I didn't get mine off amazon but it is the same product. Better off getting a GM brand but they are so hard to come by. Good luck!
B00U0JJUAW|5|worked awesome! super bright!
B00A3UNYW8|5|Very easy and simple to use. Just follow the instructions in your vehicle owners manual to use this tool to retrain your tire pressure monitoring system to match your current wheel configuration.  Worked great on my 2011 GMC Yukon
B00H6XPZN6|2|Terrible sticking ability. Small. You're much better off tinting your windows and saving the headache
B00C4B1F7U|4|First one I got did not fit, called the manufacturer from the number on the shipping box. They sent me new one right away and it fit fine. Installed in about 20 minutes.
B002NGCO30|5|First of all this isn't going to power everything in your house so don't expect too much. I used it for charging a portable DVD player while camping once, a usb fan for probably 4 hours, an iPhone and a few other little phone boosts. I would pull the cord to charge for one approximately 3 min cycle here and there and take it in the car and charge it a little while we were out an about. Also aired up 2 flat tires which saved us because we were on the side of a mountain! Don't over use and think it's going to last you days and days and turn it off when not using! Great for camping! Would buy another but this one is already doing the job!
B00SIQH8A8|1|Just horrible. It's not magnetic at all. It's only some soft rubber with a separate strip of tape. Just not what I was offered.
B0002MABJG|5|Works great in my 4 runner!  I bought the extra barrier cause I have a sneaky dog who fits thru lil spaces to get to her momma.  It stays put and doesn't rattle or fall
B003CSQU0G|5|Gauge works flawless as I excepted with an auto meter.
B005257R0O|5|Used this to fix some very faded tail lights...they look brand new now! Great product!
B002N1J5IM|4|It would have been nice  if both Heng and Fantastic used inter changeable frames but I made it fit with a little work.
B001GMONUY|1|I was very disappointed with this cab cover: First it did not fit my 2015 2dr Wrangler very well, It seemed to be too narrow for my vehicle. Second when I tried to hook the supplied hold down straps, the cheap plastic hooks broke AND the material tore near one of the eyelets. I contacted Amazon for an immediate return and I was very satisfied with the return service and quick refund of my money.
B003CK75LC|5|save a tube foil and puncture.
B0001CMUV4|5|This thing is awesome! I use it for my small kayak trailer and my hitch carrier. It gets things very tight and easy to install.<br /><br />Bottom line - simple design, easy install, works great<br /><br />Well worth the cost to me!
B001O7PNS2|5|Very good product. I use it after every wash. Great shine.
B00HI325TG|2|It did not fit well and I sent it back.
B00VY5L46Y|5|easily rebuilt the carburetor and all parts fit perfectly
B0009IQZFM|5|I love Meguiar's product. Their product always giving me an excellent result. I love this drying product better than the other one I bought from a local AutoZone, it's apparently not a microfiber but essentially a rubber kind of drying towel. I don't know what it is called but this one tends to leave a lot  trails of water on my Jet Black Bmw.
B00192KY04|5|It fits perfectly. Now the bugs will have to find a new home.
B002ZTK734|5|They fit perfect. No issues with having flaws other than they don't send them painted black more off a primer. Other than that I love them.
B008NEM4RM|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B004KMKCIO|1|DO NOT BUY THIS! There is not a single cup, can, or beverage holder of any kind that fits in the opening. Total rip off, would give it 0 stars if Amazon would let me.
B009D5WXDU|5|Perfect all the way around.
B0067F0MPA|4|Works as it should. Start to finish instalation 30-45 min.
B00875N4ZI|5|much much heavier then OEM,but fits great,shipping not the fastest either,but I will stick with 5 stars :)
B00IP3GHR4|4|My key fob broke, dealer wanted some huge $$ amount to replace. Bought this, 3 minutes to move all the &#34;guts&#34; into it, and it works very good.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because it doesn't ALWAYS push the internal button, you have to push harder than the stock key fob, but that's not a huge deal. Great price for this product so I'm willing to deal with this small inconvenience.
B00KD3GWSI|1|Terrible material. material arrived short in length, material scuffed in several days
B000E28G32|5|Very satisfied
B003UVCY00|1|I bought this spotlight in December and loved it!!  Its super bright and small.  But in July it stopped working:/  So maybe not such a great product!!
B000COC67E|5|Works great. Assembles easily, and holds this fat guy without issue.
B003VDX5D2|3|Very nice step. Will NOT work on Explorer Sport Trac without modification! Right where the plate mounts is a 6' X 6&#34; opening on each side to access the latch. Had to remove the tailgate cover and I had to make a plate to fit over this void in able to install steps. PITA! Seems OK now. 3 hour job. Do not buy before checking your tailgate.
B00WVJR0D8|5|I love this light! I bought it for my 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 500r and it works like a charm. The installation took about 20-30min just because there was a bar right in the way but we worked around it, it just took some time. The light make a world of difference and it looks so much better than the old ones. I would definitely recomend this product
B00W6LVWH6|5|Fast shipping. Product was exactly what it said. Fit perfect. I wouldn't buy another brand
B00RH3AMIS|5|Very sturdy and bell designed.
B00A3BPF8I|5|This is a great little hand made product. Good materials and craftsmanship.
B00Y8TTJ3I|5|So far I am very impressed with my new steering wheel cover. Pete emailed me when the color I wanted was available. I ordered the cover, and it arrived the very next day! Great customer service!<br />I was able to install it without difficulty. It is comfortable to use while driving. The most impressive thing is that I can actually grab the steering wheel and not get burnt - when I come back to my car after it has been sitting in 110 degree weather!<br />Now I'm thinking of buying another one for my husband's car.
B000HBNTX2|4|as expected.
B00KU93U58|4|Work great. Just as advertised
B00GWFKSOK|4|Better coverage than the factory mats. A little spendy, but kept the carpet in my truck much more protected during the slushy winter months than factory mats.
B00VCS0U22|5|Perfect replacement for another Shakespeare Marine Antennae (3020) that was pearly designed.  The reception distance was said to by 15 miles, but it is better than stated.
B004HEBN1A|5|It is a well made rack and arrived exactly as it was advertised.
B00DHQ6ZXK|5|Fits my Fusion perfectly and does a great job of blocking the sun. It's really hard to keep track of oncoming traffic and cars in front of you so be careful. I've heard horns blowing but couldn't see if some idiot almost hit me but evidently they were able to get out of the way, so no harm, no foul, right?
B00QEC0ANA|5|Fast service.  Product as described.
B00JKECHPS|1|Didn't last in the freezer warehouse were I work.dissapointed.
B00MB0DO8W|5|Bought item for daughters boyfriend. He loved it!
B001DRGB9S|3|working well
B00OD3V31K|3|The overall quality of the item was top notch. One issue we had was the back seat covers are 60/40 for the bottom of the seat but not for the back. This design did not work with the seats. Modifications had to be made in order to use the back.
B001L5MQDC|4|Ok, but metal had some rust.
B001BCHT7S|5|I didn't think it was going to match my car because it's silver,but once put on it looked really good.
B004HNT4WQ|5|Easy to use, works great.  Thanks for the previous reviews, I've been careful about not getting pinched!
B001VYO9JC|3|First breeze it ripped but excellent fit easy to repair not good for outdoor use perfect for indoor storage
B000CITHSQ|3|only tail gate cap not three sides like add shows.
B0083XPUUG|4|Easy install only took about half a day, you can actually see the back springs from inside my wheels spokes dropped me about 1&#34; 1/2 2&#34; tops not too low but definitely noticeable to stock height Mazdas almost no wheel gap in the front and little to no gap in the back.
B005KVLX50|5|Excellent extender for my purpose. I intend on using it to transport my 14' canoe in a Tacoma truck. I have also obtained two roof top foam pads to place on the canoe rails to set on top of the truck cab. By using the extender in the elevated position, the canoe should be high enough to set one end on top of the cab. Using a rachet strap on one end and one on the front, it should hold the canoe in place. Another strap wrapped around the canoe and through the cab door openings should help to keep the canoe on the truck.  'Practice makes perfect.'
B009UZ1TE2|1|If I could give this product zero stars, I would.<br /><br />I purchased this Waterless Wash and Wax at a local gas station after a salesperson demonstrated it. I was impress with how clean my car come from just one quick application, but boy, what a rip off this stuff turned out to be!<br /><br />He said that it would keep my car clean for 30 days. Not only did it not keep my car clean for more than a few hours of being on the interstate, but it left a greasy film on my car that several washes through the car wash would not remove. I cannot see out of my windows!<br /><br />I stupidly bought the entire cleaning kit for $50! Not only does the interior cleaner spray all over everything, but it doesn't clean the seats.<br /><br />Probably the worst part about this whole thing is that 50 cents for each can goes to breast cancer research. This stuff is so toxic, it cannot be healthy.<br /><br />I wish i could get my money back!
B004RNRAWW|4|Works great on the Little Red Campfire.  Especially if you can't have a real fire.  Set this on top with a pot or skillet with something in it and you can tell the park ranger your cooking!  LoL  It works.  Cooks super slow, but as an excuse to have a fire....priceless!
B000CIY0U6|4|Nice heavy weight tailgate mat . Fit tailgate perfect .Only wish they would have included stainless instead of black metal screws .
B003EQ0BME|5|I trust Mobil 1 Quality and with a good Price a Convenient shipping, a definite A+!
B0041P5SZC|5|Really nice looking unit. Easy install. Just follow the instructions closely so you don't distort the cover. And, if you're upgrading from stock and have pipes, you'll need a map so keep that in mind. The outcome though is worth it. Very noticeable smooth power increase. Worth the money.
B002DZJQ0A|3|it's dual lock, good stuff. I wish I saw it scaled next to a quarter so I knew  how minuscule a sample it was. very easy to smuggle into prison.
B004809X9W|4|These are a great product but you have to make sure the mirrors are clean and get the suction cup wet when you mount them.  If you have them on for very long they will break loss so you will have to re wet the suction cups.
B0046BFXD8|5|Fits my 96 GMC suburban
B005LRD0B8|3|Some of the mirror fish has come off
B00G0OFOV0|5|Excellent replacement and easy to install.
B00H8SWJWE|5|SWEET!!!!!
B007ACZW1I|4|good quality
B009G9LU1Y|5|Excellent product, delivery!!!
B000KKFVLS|5|As advertised, shipping was a little slow but showed up in enough time to get it installed before leaving on a trip.
B007NGB3FK|5|Fits perfect! Looks amazing
B001AIZ5HY|1|I got a chance to use this after almost a month I received it, so I got everything ready and opened the kit, and guess what, there were no gold disks in the kit, there were three of white disks and 6 of gray foam disks so I am guessing they put three extra gray disks instead of gold disks, and when I tried to ask for a return, it was too late, the return option was already closed.
B0002JMV06|4|Good quality build but it does NOT include replacement clips.  That's the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars.
B0101A484C|5|Love it
B00FY80ZXU|5|Excellent quality. Made in USA. easy install. Plus Rough Country's customer service was awesome.
B00BLZ5N0K|5|Worked great for my 94 Geo Prizm.
B00H1IBKIK|5|Good product at good price
B0009IK7XI|5|great
B00IQWP50Y|5|Looks great anywhere you stick it .
B004JKW2J4|5|A very good product. It made traveling a lot easier. Kept our luggage and other items dry and easily accessible. Made riding in our SUV much more roomy by allowing items that would have been in the car to be carried in the cargo carrier bag at the rear of the vehicle. More than once on our vacation travels other motorists wanted to inspect the bag and asked where they could get one.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Good product, good price.
B004KED7KW|5|Love my new tool.
B00AIM1TO6|5|Excellent product.He gave a beautiful look to the car
B00BITHVOU|4|Exact match
B00N9S82EQ|3|Cute...cheaply made
B00D42AFS8|5|Awesome
B00VWK0XOU|3|Could have been a little bigger
B000WJX4BQ|4|Had bad luck with a cheap alternative (Battery Shark).  This one worked like the original...
B00KAWSFE6|2|Didn't fit tight into hood; OK if you are reselling!
B008G1WEK4|5|Perfect Fit!!! almost Exactly like original except for the color of the plastic on the back-side. These are black while the originals or grey.
B00V2VF5GU|5|I got them for my four wheeler they work great well worth the buy
B000CB3ZCM|5|Installed in less then 10 mins. i did not remove the glove blox it was way easier to go under the passenger dash and replace it from there. fit perfectly fine in my 1996 e36 , the filter that was in there was from original . And was causing airflow to be minimum . This worked amazing more airflow . Great product.
B0086JI9AU|5|Used this for my 86 year old dads scooter. It makes him more visible to cars and that makes me happy.
B012UVF4N4|5|I bought these headlights for my 2001 3.8L mustang and they fit perfectly! They are also very bright headlights. Both projectors come on when high beams are flipped on, otherwise its just one of them on but both produce fantastic light down road! Only downfall I have seen is they take the H1 bulb which is small and I dont really like that drop after having the big 9007 bulbs before. I wired my Halos into my dim lights for now until I get around to wiring them into my fog lights I added on a separate switch. I would highly recommend these lights!
B00C85OSYO|5|Goods were as advertised.
B0028R5ELI|5|Very detailed
B00DPIID5S|5|EXECELENTE
B0087NB1IW|5|Great mic system, can hear loud and clear.
B00L3K3EYA|5|EXECELENTE
B0039Z3SRA|5|Have these on all 4 doors to both keep the water off my expensive speakers and to give them an enclosure to mount in in my doors.
B00Q3B12Y8|3|The gauges are great however I wish they had a back lighting for night time instead of the meter display.
B00G6AZ8FA|2|I really like the style of this light and I really like that it has the turn signals, brake light, and tag light built in.<br /><br />BUT, it's not a quality item.  I ordered two, to use on dirt bikes that I'm converting to make 'street legal'.  On one unit, the right turn signal was extremely dim, it had a few burnt out LED's.  On the other unit, the brake light had a few burnt out LED's making the light pattern dim and asymmetrical.  I only paid $9 each for the lights, so it wasn't worth the effort of returning them.  Its a bad sign that I received two defective units.<br /><br />I didn't use the one with the bad turn signal, but I've been using the one with the bad brake light for a few months, and it's held up fine.
B002SRZQV6|5|works great.
B00U1Y5IZM|4|It does the job
B00EYC1VA8|3|Product is fine but the mix is odd
B00651C9OI|1|Quality product with one exception. The threaded stud supplied for imports is to long to allow the antenna to screw all the way down<br />On 2005-2015 Toyota Tacoma trucks. It's a special stud with unthreaded shoulder in the center so does not lend itself to just cutting it shorter.<br />Unable to use it at all.
B009XIWRXI|1|overpriced...doesn't work.  better and easier to replace the check valve.  don't waste your time or money.
B00ZN5T846|5|Bright almost too bright perfect in wife's car.
B000GU3UE2|5|My favorite 2-cycle oil for injector systems, I use this in both PW50 motorcycles that my kids ride. I wouldn't use anything else. I have never fouled a plug, and after 3 seasons on the motor, the piston and cylinder were still in spec. Smells good too.
B0051DR9S2|1|Just like lots of aftermarket parts, this one ALMOST fits perfectly.  With intake and outlet ends installed, the mounting bracket doesn't line up with the factory mounting point.  I'll look up a better one and throw this one away.
B00IF6400C|4|Excelent....
B00DGVRXD2|5|Excellent product! Good Price. Fast Delivery.
B00D3YEGO6|4|The rhinestone license plate cover is beautiful and its really cool that it cones in a nice box and with a cleaning clothe.  However, I have not been able to put it on my car yet because when I tried, the screws it came with were a 1/4 inch too short and would not thread into my car.  I'm waiting for a chance to go get longer screws and try again.
B00LFL8PEG|4|Seems to be a decent quality product, all parts were as shown and they installed without issue. Have been on the vehicle (2002 VW Jetta, 1.8T) for over a week now and seem to be doing fine. I do not expect the longevity of a premium bearing, but for the price and being installed on an older car, can't beat the price.
B0045WBVUM|5|Bought at the recommendation of my B-I-L.  He swears by this!  I haven't taken any long rides yet, but it's comfortable in my desk chair!
B005JU5XE4|5|The Bosch 19 in. wiper Blades are the BEST,I will never use any other brand EVER again,  Thanks,Bosch AND Amazon,Mike
B00NPIUFMM|1|Horrible light output.  Returned.
B000C5FKDK|5|fit perfectly..
B00PZUM9XQ|5|It work perfect on my son four wheeler
B004BTD8RS|5|I got the part on time and it was the correct part.
B00XV84MZW|5|Looks great on the bike. More than I excepted at that price.
B00AR379U4|5|Worked great with only minor adjustments right out of the box!
B000N321MO|5|Excelente
B00L2WGHDE|1|Do not buy! Piece of junk! One piece broken upon delivery. Does not work
B00P8WC148|4|Have my exhaust tip a nice sporty  look would've given it 5 stars except i  couldn't install it  using all the screws it didn't fit that way but i did get to stay on and so far it hasn't fallen off
B00774647U|5|I recomend  them
B00TJ2X95I|5|exellent
B00ODGR2L2|5|Light weight, easy to use, exactly as described, fast shipping, and most important great price.
B005IGUXVM|5|Really nice cover. Heavy weight material. Goes on easy and fits like a glove. No excess material hanging off the sides. Looks good on the bike. I highly recommend this cover for anyone that wants to protect their R1.
B000OAXOJ0|3|Does NOT fit factory pipe. Good quality and fast shipment.
B004GDBPS8|5|Simple...It fits...5 star...
B000C57W7C|5|Great factory replacements. Installed on a 2005 Chevy Tahoe 4x4.
B000HRWGKS|5|delivered fast and worked perfectly for me
B0053OBMKA|5|so far so good. I replaced the throttle body in less than 30 min and so far the little yellow wrench is gone
B000AOMQ80|5|I've been using Slime for years. This stuff works!
B004ZF4LNI|5|Super easy to install and they are very bright. Nice white on the 6000k.
B00TR9DPXE|3|Was a little surprised to find all of the plastic deco on this wheel. I guess time will tell as to it's longevity. Also, the bolts that hold the decorative plastic spokes stick up high enough that it is necessary to remove all of them prior to mounting tires on them otherwise the tire mounting machine will hit them. A little bit of a pain. Had it not been for those two items, I would have rated them a 4 or 5. Good looking wheel and a great match for my truck.
B008BWE2RQ|4|Nice glasses, great night vision, but still get some wind around the glasses, comfortable and lightweight.
B009DJTSMK|5|Helped my jeep back to normal after my fender bender she's better then ever now might Even buy one for the other side
B00X4AXGCC|5|I received the Mercon transmission fluid very quickly and this is the best price that I could find anywhere.
B00EFGK7AS|5|Item as described. Arrived promptly
B00F9LPJ8S|5|I'll be getting another one for my other motorcycle whenever that one goes dead.
B000P5DKXO|5|Just as described.  All fit perfect.  Bike looks new now.
B002P8HBBQ|5|Good quality for the price
B006LJ1IV4|4|Not a direct fit for 5202 as it states. Cutting and splicing is required. Either that or I had two incorrect products sent to me..
B00X60O86S|5|Got em on my Kubota tractors.Look Badass.Ridin Dirty.lol
B00PVXXK76|5|Worked great.  The shipping was a little slow as it was shipped from China, but it was exactly the same as the original.
B00K1C1WC2|4|Good product
B001GKVZAW|1|Arrived broken
B000B68V6I|5|So far so good, works as advertised. I have hod no problem starting my chipper since I added the stabilizer.
B000CF6I40|5|Wonderful, great price and fast service
B00TJD0ZW2|5|I have had this unit for a month, with daily (and sometimes twice daily) charges, and it has worked flawlessly so far.  It came with good installation instructions, and all the hardware needed to mount the unit to my garage wall.  Therefore I can't comment on how this unit would perform outside in the elements.  My Chevy Volt pulls about 14 amps while charging, so I'm only using less than half the capacity of this unit.  Therefore the cord and connector stay cool to the touch.  Not sure how it would perform on vehicles that pull more amps, but I suspect it would be fine.  The front of the unit (in the area of the ClipperCreek logo) does get warm to the touch, though, but not in a way that concerns me.  The cord is plenty long and substantial, but still very flexible (try not to laugh at that comment, lol).  When plugging into my car, the unit makes a loud &#34;thunk&#34;, but it's not in any way bothersome.  It indicates to me that the unit has heavy-duty contactors inside.  If you intend to mount this unit outside, it would be nice if it had a light in the connector (like the 120v unit that came with my car), but I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker.  Get this one, you won't regret it.
B000EQAW4Y|5|Great product, delivered in record time, but you must ignore the picture of a shock absorber and go with the description
B0014JN68O|5|I just received this grill. I ordered the carrying case and adapter for the one can propane tank. All I can says is WOW!!! What a great little grill. It heated up to over 600 degrees in a little more than 5 minutes. Cooked a great couple of steaks! This will be perfect for tailgating this fall! GREAT GRILL!!!!
B00M3NEBMK|4|good
B0006305WO|5|Had the sizes I needed.  Made the installation of coolant hoses easy.  I prefer the constant tension clamps over the screw type because they do not need to be tightened after the hoses start to shrink.
B004LEYIQ8|5|Excellent oil. Will be purchasing again for my 2010 Audi
B000BUU5XG|5|I bought two of these Gen-turi exhaust diverters for both truck and trailer, both of which have diesel generators. Very easy to use, goes together very quickly and works as advertised. I feel better now that I am not fuming my neighbors out at the race track.
B005BNP7UO|3|It's very cheaply made. all plastic including the little prongs that hold it in place.
B00DJ5KEEA|5|get's the job done beautifully
B00CMSSBRC|5|wrong one for my car but still works
B000BZ52DO|5|Parts are exactly as described
B002ARTH8C|5|Looks great on my new Harley CVO
B00EAWDEJ8|1|FYI, these did NOT fit my 2005 Grand Cherokee.  The included instructions were basic (example: how to rotate a bulb when installing)...NOTHING about the vehicle.  I should have stopped there.  But I wanted these to work, so foraged ahead.  When removing the overhead light/dome lights on my jeep, parts had to be broken as they are molded closed.  I guess I am going to have to fix it with some screws.  OK, I can do that.  Next time if I need to replace the bulbs it will be easier, right?  Trying to have a positive attitude here...  But, unfortunately, these do not fit.  Not one of the  pack is even remotely close. So, I am now requesting a refund.... hoping that I do not have to pay to return these things.  I am getting really tired of buying online.  Seems 9 times out of 10 things are not as they claim & it is up to me to prove it.  Who has time for this crap?<br />ANYWAY, see photos for your reference & judge for yourself..
B00R6S0MEI|2|Didn't work for me since I don't want the hard spray part.  I water plants and need a softer spray than this product has.  Plus, it only turns off on the hard spray side of the sequence which is unhandy.
B00LSYWF82|5|Excellent item. Quick delivery. Thanks!
B002626OLY|5|Great leather kit does the job to clean all good leather bags and shoes
B00GSAUHB8|2|Doesn't fit my 2012 Chrysler Town and Country very well.  It does work, but barely.  I only use it while car camping about two weeks out of the year, so I will tolerate the sun protector.
B00E5P180M|4|I bought this for the cargo area in my Jeep GC Limited. I trimmed the sides a little but left the length the way it came to cover the gap between the cargo area and the seats. This way no small objects or liquid can fall into the gap. The material is similar to a rubber car mat and is very floppy not rigid like the more expensive cargo mats. But for the price I am very happy and it looks good in the Jeep. I would have liked the tread pattern to protrude a bit more to give it a better ruggedness but like I said for the price you can't beat it.
B00L5QRG4Q|2|I purchased this item for my son's birthday. nicely made but small. only keeping them because it's Batman!
B006N94M6K|5|Great!!!!
B001CF3QU8|5|worked perfectly
B0006BIACS|1|18mm x 2 ends is not 36mm wrench!!!  When will you change the description?  Sorry I didn't look closer prior to purchase.
B002OUMVZG|5|Exactly what i needed
B002ON0EV6|5|Great looking product, nice finish, and looks very nice on my vehicle. Not too large, and not too small.
B00BCRM9RM|5|Omg these are like a match made in heaven to my seats! They look awesome in my 2007 Envoy! And it stands out against my midnight blue color! I love walking up to my car and seeing the Purple!! Once my hubby gets the steering wheel cover on, I'll put my pictures up! I don't want to break a nail, so he can do it! Everything else was very easy to put in! I would highly recommend getting these, if your are looking for a full set of covers!<br />Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes. All opinions expressed are completely my own and may differ from yours.
B006WPQNB2|5|It's perfect!  The height of it. Is do easy to empty and easy to fill. We love it :-)
B002VF0HL4|5|Helpful A+ server Five star and my thank you for
B005LGWRZY|5|Perfect fit.  Great delivery.
B007TY59TM|5|Worked great. Fit was perfect and rolls up and down faster than the factory unit.
B005C59TVE|5|I thought this would ship as a blank. But was pre cut. Worked fine.
B00844UB62|4|Easy assembly onto trailer just tested , seems good haven't went far yet.
B0082LJMC6|4|-spray can is awesome... extremely fine spray, easy to mix hardener by shaking... my only concern is whether or not the 2k (clear) is compatible with non-2k paint (color)... i've heard that it is not... that would be a problem.
B00279AO26|5|Shipped fast, just as described.  Easy to install and good price!
B00GBRROQO|1|Wish I could give it a negative 1.  The instructions say make sure the bottom front is outside the weatherstripping, otherwise water gets channeled into the door.  The bottom would not stay outside,  I went to a body shop, and they tried to install it better but could not.  They put some tape on it to try to keep water out of the door.  I always buy the tape on visors.  I've had excellent luck with them.  I had these 'in-track' once before on a pick up truck and they would not stay in well.  The first car wash removed both of them.  I could not find the tape on visors for my 2010 fx, so I bought these.  Wasted $100!!!  The rear ones go in with clips and stay in place.  The front ones do not have any clips or tape.  My driver side drops an inch every time I roll down the window.  I got used to that.  Today the passenger side just flew out.  I was only going 30 mph.  I couldn't even go back for it to try to return it because the cars behind me ran it over.  I've had glue-on visors on my other cars for years with countless car washes and never broke or lost one.
B008MISDH4|5|Excellent oil for my motorcycle and lawnmower - top quality, runs cool and helps with overall mpg.Great price too on Amazon!!
B001JSPNVS|5|works great
B001AWLTX4|2|Its is made cheap my old grandmother can make it by going to the craft store but for the price it does its job and keep nasty things out of your mouth and face but will not keep you warmer in the winter.
B00603DSI2|5|Fit like a glove, completely covering cargo area. Especially like the raised edges to keep dirt in!
B00E5O5MLO|5|Very happy with them received them within the time scheduled
B000FMM6NW|5|Fits great
B0045WBVUM|4|Saves my butt on those long trips. I use it on my Kawasaki 1500 Vulcan and I would recommend this product.
B004J1D8AU|1|Second set of these and the paint wares off after the first wash! if you are here to buy an extra set it is not worth it!
B00LAUXJTS|5|A++++++
B00KLFFNQK|5|I installed this on my 2003 F-150 Super Cap with a 6' Bed about 6 months ago.  The installation was very easy and I think it only took me about an hour total to install it.  I spent a little longer because I had to adjust it a couple of times to get it perfect.  Seems really durable and it is very easy to roll up and roll down and clip in.  My tailgate locks so it gives good  security since you can't unlock the cover without opening the tailgate.  I have drove through snow and heavy rain and there hasn't been a single drop of water inside.  Also I can take it completely off in a matter of minutes to get my 4-wheeler in the back of my truck with the tailgate shut.  Overall I am very pleased with it and don't see myself going back to a tool box anytime soon.
B00KTHYDA2|5|Easy enough to program by yourself.. Works well with my 07 4runner. 5 stars!
B0049MX8N6|5|Looks great and it went on quick and easy.
B00N9HVEI8|4|Looks good, fells good but smells like a Chinese factory 3 months later.
B00IGGW7D8|5|A+
B005NLQAHS|5|Works fine for my 2001 Mustang 3.8L! I use the Torque app for this.
B0019I7IVQ|5|Awesome and fit perfect
B000JJHH8K|5|Haven't had a chance to put any miles on it yet, but man it's a nice gauge I've ran auto meter in all my race cars never had one quit.
B000GVEY64|5|After its first trip to Sturgis ,4600 miles it managed to survive.
B006NKM1CQ|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B001LHVOVK|5|Does exactly as Advertised and has the ability to erase previous faults. Also inside the instruction manual is a list of all obd2 codes.
B000TCGD96|5|We use these to watch for our companions behind us while riding our snow mobiles.  No need for rear view mirror that can get ripped off in the brushy areas.
B00C88B8J4|5|Easy to install and they work. No more streaks down the side of the RV.
B00DZL2B9O|5|Hold all my CDs in my car and is perfect. Plus the price was good too.
B0012WHBSO|5|Very nice. Works well and quick and stores nicely in my truck tool box.
B00P9RAPAO|4|Great quality bag for the OEM topcase from Yamaha. Very well made, expandable compartment, and fits great inside the topcase. My only reason for not giving 5 starts is the zipper placement. The zipper pulls are sitting EXACTLY where the topcase bottom half & top half meet, so they are ALWAYS getting caught in there when you try to close the topcase. Total pain in the *** every time you close the topcase. Aside from that, it is really handy to have contents in this bag and the bag is very well made.
B0013FXXGE|5|shipping was quick, install easy. works perfectly for a couple months now.
B00FDQSUA8|5|seemed to work fine. my A/C recharge lasted an entire season. (Better than I hoped for.)<br />I'm going to try one more time to see if &#34;stop leak&#34; can repair my leaks.
B01092I9LA|1|Garbage! Thin! Hard to install! I'm returning this product! It cost me $17 to return this product- they wouldn't send me a packing slip- So if buy these make sure you really really want them- for $50 you get what you pay for- the real good ones are $200 & that is just for the two front seats-💩💩💩
B00BN6AR7G|5|The battery was just what I needed to get my Cyclops light, working again.
B000IG20RW|4|No complaints.  Good product and the shipping was on the money.
B00YML13OU|5|I love being able to put these signs on my car when teaching my son how to drive.
B000GU3MRM|5|Great for a long ride...it really reduces the vibration on my feet compared to the stock pegs on my VTX 1300-C!
B00IA7RA0I|5|I LOVE IT!! it's very hard to find Jasmine merchandise.  My daughter's name is Jasmine so I'm trying to find Jasmine merchandise before her first birthday.
B009PHD7P4|5|Fantastic!  Strong, easy to install and rock solid reliable.
B00BSEZIQI|5|Using in a 5th wheel to conserve batteries.  Bright but not glaring, we're very happy with these lights, replacing the hot high intensity bulbs.
B001931UAQ|3|2008 Dodge Nitro. Notable improvement in shifting response. Slightly notable increase in power. Decreased city milage by about 2 mpg. No change in highway milage. Tow a 4500 lb. trailer. Slight improvement in towing performance with about 2 mpg improvement while towing. I waited until I could thoroughly evaluate this product before writing a review. I bought this from Amazon at a substantially discounted price. I am glad I waited. I could not justify what it delivers at the full price.
B000MW91RE|5|Best sandpaper I have ever used. If you are going to wet sand then make sure you soak it for at least 10 minutes.
B00RV83UUG|1|Can't even tell the lights on. Mounted on the front of boat and it doesn't even put out enough light to travel safely. Will not buy another
B002NEWXH4|5|This is the only sandpaper I will use. Make sure you let it soak for at least 10 minutes if you are going to wet sand or it could scratch the surface.
B00194C8H4|5|I love the pants. I ordered them two inches larger then I usually take and they fit just right.<br />they are &#34;not&#34; loose fit - pretty snug around the crotch - I'm hoping they will stretch out a bit.
B00UG2QYSY|1|Initially it was great. I gave it 5 stars.   After few months, color changed to dark yellow / brownish.  And glue stopped working. All the strips came off the doors.  Awful after few months Do NOT waste your $$
B00OZCK676|5|These light bars are exceptionally great . I give a 5***** rating  . Easy to mount and solid .
B005ZY9OFS|4|Fit great
B00NWT0290|5|Works just like new. Fit my 01 wrangler.
B0009IBJE4|3|Not very fast charging but OK since it is easy to store in my RV.  Cable clamps could be much better for improved connection. Bought at big discount to pay full price would have been a rip off.
B00P9OF04I|5|This is probably THE best lens restorer on the market. It's extremely easy to use as long as you follow the directions to a T, It removed 10 years worth of oxidation in mere minutes and the sealing process leaves your lens with a brilliant finish, just like a new lens.
B001GJ3FIS|5|works great!!!
B005KLQ9EU|2|sadly even the &#34;longs&#34; are too short. The fact is that they just do not need to have this kind of tension on them. They pull the ballistics down on your knee cap and over time with your knees bent on a long ride,at least one side pops off.<br />I have a long inseam (34 inch) and my pants are the longest available.<br />When standing the pant leg touches the top of the shoe.<br />I own venture air mesh pants and wear mid calf sidi boots.<br />I will be attempting to add two inches to this with a neoprene hose piece glued in the middle with some outstandingly powerful glue I own.
B00VUGQ0WK|5|Came in quick and is exactly as described very bright
B000C7TV6A|5|So far so good fits perfectly in 06 coupe
B00GBSCROC|4|It's perfect for all my hand tools, I'm happy with my purchase.
B000BYD78W|5|good
B00RGZWIW0|4|This is a good organizer for the things I carry in the back of my car.  There are 2 compartments and a velcro edged divider to turn a larger compartment into 2 medium sized ones.  It  handles light to medium weight things: grocery bags, paper towels, window cleaner.  It would corral heavier objects, too because the sides are sturdy.  This is not intended to carry heavy objects though because the bottom or floor is soft.
B00C0G5ASO|3|I just wish they were a bit bigger.
B000XQO0VG|5|Well engineered and perfect for my application. Has increased top end performance slightly, added a nice 'note' to the exhaust sound and shed some weight too.
B00ONDM07G|5|Easy to install and great utility for my '12 Wrangler. This is a must so you don't have to use a vent clip holder or a steering wheel cell phone holder.
B0046ID5EK|3|Sometimes it doesn't work
B004GC9H98|5|It fit perfect.
B005CDNCQO|5|kind of a tight fit on my toyota corolla 2005. hard to take off. but made my check engine light turn off.
B000E7SY0C|5|Shopped for a bike rack and bought a few.  This one was a fraction of the cost of the one my husband was going to purchase and does the job with style and ease.  Glad we bought it.  Carried 3 bikes for 8 hours each way with no problem or incidence...
B00LULJIW4|4|Easy to install and seems to work well.
B001AVSIOI|5|This lock is exactly as advertised.  It is built very sturdy and since it is noticeable, it's presence should deter those with sticky fingers. If you have a decorative hitch cover, this is a must buy!
B001LHVOVK|3|Good for the price and does what I need. No bells or whistles, but a smile maker anyway.
B000GUWSFE|5|exactly what i wanted
B005GY9V2S|1|This bar is not long enough for 20lb propane bottles, also my system uses a half inch bar not 3/8
B0051RI3RE|5|Stuck it on the back of my motorcycle helmet. The adhesive is very strong and the emblem is pliable enough to fit to the contour of a motorcycle helmet. I bought the blue and white version and put on my old helmet a few years ago. But that helmet was really-really heavy so I sold it to a friend. I like this sticker because the shades of gray/black with the faux carbon fiber are a better match to the color scheme on my s1000.
B003R2U3LE|3|This fits the huge windshield but ... it is really hard to roll back up.  I hope it softens up a bit with time and use.
B0002JEZ1O|5|Great for our camper, lost my first one so this is my second. They are nice to have.
B00XYCG2LM|5|Just got it, so no opinion on longevity. Looks great, super easy installation.
B00EJXE66I|5|Ok
B00029WRKU|1|Poor product. Don't bother trying on a Ford Flex. Could not tighten properly no matter how many different ways I tried adjusting the feet and position on the mirror. More frustrating, since its not shipped from Amazon, the return time is limited and I just found out I'm stuck with this piece of junk.
B00K8DD8C6|4|It works fine, but our trailer is low, so we can't use the robo foot.  I wish it had came with a regular foot and wheel foot, it would be much handier.
B0055RADLY|5|love it as I am a golden mom
B003WHPO9A|3|I love them. They fit my pickup perfectly!
B00FBKWCHS|5|Great product and very simple to install.  The color of the 3k were slightly different than I imagined they would be but I still like the overall look.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|this lock will protect whatever it is you are trying to protect.
B003554TB8|5|I've previously used a roof top carrier from another company and we drove threw heavy rains, needless to say, it rained inside our car. It was absolutely horrible.<br />I have a Chevy Cruze this Roofbag for perfect, held so many things, and we also drove threw heavy rains and not a drop of water inside the bag or my car. Our next purchase is DEFINITLY the duffles that for inside! Thank you for this product! It made my trip a lot less stressful!
B009W08I80|4|Mounting was pretty cheap and bent, had to cut off and fab my own mounts. Also no mounting bolts came with. Not big of a deal though. Need to find a better vented cap
B00BHRM7YW|2|Missing parts in package
B00HXC4OJG|5|Works great
B00OM6Q9UI|5|Proud to be ...
B0090UN116|5|Good product !! Easy to Install..
B00NQGDIOU|4|Great buy ,it fit just right on my Rav4
B00BQE5JAK|2|Not nearly as bright as I expected
B00WTUJDI4|5|Makes a big orange tractor look good & mean.P51 style.They get a lot of attention.
B000ELP6PE|1|Great price but part didn't work when installed. Had to hit it with a wrench to get it to start the car and even then it made an awful noise.
B000C9GYOA|5|vent in my 1997 suburban was not working right,was getting hot where was too be cold or cold where it needed to be hot,changed it out for less that half cost and work great.
B00DKWJ9VG|5|Works perfectly
B004YGR8KQ|5|Love it!!! Just love the look and feel of these caps. Far more superior to what came with the original
B00KTIVEP8|5|Well, you found a great place to start. Not only do these remotes both work with my car but they came 2 days sooner than I expected. They were easy to program too.
B00GSAUHB8|1|An awkward mess of a sun protector. I have yet to be able to &#34;twist&#34; it up properly even after watching the video. Each time I have tried to store it I ultimately just have to throw it in the back seat in a coiled mess. It cannot even be returned without paying $6.57 which is not happening since I have already wasted enough money on it. Either buy a standard accordion panel sun protector or something that is not made of the same awful material as this.
B00801RHG6|5|Got it as seller promised and this is a GREAT deal, now my 1995 camry drives like brand new!!!!
B000E28C7M|5|Satisfied!!
B00CFALFXY|4|Great all around microfiber towels.  Not perfect, but for the price you cannot go wrong.
B00GXY5E8U|3|i received my new Jack Quick 3500W-WR today and installed it within about an hour of the FedEx guy dropping it off.  Fit's well and operates as described.  The remote FOB is very nice and has a sliding cover to prevent accidental adjustment.  Overall it has a good quality feel.<br /><br />Now for the quirks.  The level bubble on top is out of plumb.  If I adjust to the bubble the trailer is easily 6&#34; high on the nose or more. I don't see how to adjust it so I'll just have to ignore it.  The level is also the cover/cap to the manual adjustment.<br /><br />Now for the reason I gave this 3 stars.  The actual head unit has an on/off and up/down switch.  The unit will operate in on and off position.  Not sure why and don't want to have to check the wiring.  Will have to look through the paperwork for a tech number to call.  Will update once I talk with the mfg.
B000E3GHE6|3|Made the interior on my Land Rover look like new
B004NBJM5G|5|100%
B00029X5VA|2|The wiper blades didn't match my Acura mdx rear wiper, they were too short
B0002SR2RY|5|fits perfect
B009DJTD8Y|2|Blinker won't work
B000JFJM14|5|So far so good, the only way to change the oil in my jet ski, I've tried cheaper brands - nothing compares to this mityvac
B000NVW1LM|5|if you have a seep or minor seal leak this is the best I have ever used including Lucas  products. Steering rack end seal seeps usually stop with 1 sometimes 2 bottles.
B001JKUPUA|5|Good product...could have been a little longer..Not a big problem
B007JSGR9Y|4|Great for the price
B00GAC768Q|5|A very helpful tool
B00SH0SS3G|3|I like it. But I have to use it upside down for it to be comfortable.
B000KBZN38|4|Is very easy to use. Strong magnets and fits my I Pad as well as other things such as my I Phone and notebooks. I use it on my Kawasaki 500R Ninja and it does the job. Highly recommend. Quality is good and price was good!
B0006H93FA|5|As advertised
B0068M0T2S|5|Five stars. The best wiper.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Works as advertised.  No rain entered the bag and the straps work great when you tie off the loose ends so they don't flap in the wind.
B0069SF8CM|5|Everything just as expected. Great plugs for a good price.
B000FQ228W|5|perfect fit
B000C9CC3M|5|Sweltering because my son's A/C would not work this summer.  This was quick fix that an 18-year old can install, and now it is working again.  This was the best price I could find, also, and did not want to trust a used part that would have the same problem as my old one.
B002YKTTGU|5|Magnet works great  Leads are long  Does the job right
B002RSIK4G|5|I have used this in the past works great.
B00VJ4LHUS|4|Pretty nice. Had a horrible smell at first. Does its job. attaches with velcro, wish it attached a different way but over all nice
B00JI5OA68|5|It's a high quality MetaL emblem and I'm satisfied with my purchase. I will be buying again. Ships fast!
B001G8AIMU|5|I haven't had to use this yet either but I love the fact that this is small  and out of the way.
B009OBW29S|5|Very good
B000TM7HXC|3|it works great seems to me accurate Asian to carry on the carrying case love it for sure.
B000BOAX1G|5|Works great.
B00CQJXL0Y|4|The winch itself is a beast! Doubtful you'll be disappointed in the product. I only rate it as 4 star due to the instuctions and factory error in packaging the correct components. To start with, the instructions, provided in a half a dozen languages, nowhere include a parts list to verify you have everything you need. Most of the small bags included are numbered so this should have been easy. Secondly, the instructions would be very vague to anyone without experience in assembly and basic skills of electronics.The install kit provides more than enough wiring for over 90% of any ATV/UTV installation. However, at this price point it would have been courteous to have included extra terminals to cut the wires/cables to length for a professional install. $15 for terminals and $50 for a 6ga. crimper later... and this happens! After 3+ hours later mounting and installing, my winch was inoperative. A phone call to the Warn Technical Service Dept. remedied the problem. Great customer service from them! seems the contactor has been upgraded to no longer require a jumper wire from the ground terminal to the Brown spade terminal for the switch. My kit had the new style switch kit without the jumper combined with the old style contactor. I fabricated the necessary jumper and all worked!
B007EWC5WS|5|Fits but the screw a bit long for my Carbon fiber hood had to use extra washer
B00KTIYZ68|5|I got this instead of replacing the entire remote. It fixed it like new!
B00RVFOPRQ|4|mirrors themselves are 5 star but the double ended thread bolts are not as strong. one broke on mine.
B00IMPEWHM|5|Fixes Chevy's habitual issue with failing clips in the tailgate handle used these on my dad's truck. My truck I got tired of replacing these once a year so I used small wire and wired it all together. Usualy however you must replace the bezel around the handle as there is no way to get it off without breaking it. That's around 5 bucks
B001KS0M5E|5|Fits and works great
B000GUPS8I|5|GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD FIT, REASONABLY PRICED !
B00F4MQJ5O|5|It was so nice I bought it twice
B000EQTZU6|5|Exact fit and fast service
B00NAU9Y0Y|5|Worked out great
B00CS7T0IQ|5|Good fit on John Deere 550 Gater. No vibration and not convex, Just what I was looking for!
B00PCE7SQ8|5|Item shipped in a prompt time and had a great fit.
B00PA7S53C|5|Arrived in as advertised.
B001GH1LWM|5|These leveled out my 2004 RAM 2500 Diesel perfectly. I was changing the upper arms, lower arm bushes, ball joints and shocks anyway, so fitting these was simply part of the job.
B000EW0KHW|4|Got error code and fixed part for 10 bucks.
B00TRCPUG6|1|They did not work
B007A2PXXK|3|Works okay.  I am still noticing some darker dye transfer spots.
B00JKOEFVW|5|worked perfectly
B005K8XOSW|5|Not my first set! Very happy with them
B00DSD4N9U|4|i love this decal of Slash and bought one for my best friend also.  I get asked all the time where I got it, of course I tell them Sticky Pig sells them on Amazon!!  This one is pretty big so make sure you measure the spot where you plan to pit it, mine is on the back window of my Jeep.
B0088SKFD8|5|Good
B006LJ80C4|5|Perfect fit and very easy to instal.
B00XNBBMDM|4|arrived fast and in pretty good condition. It had some left over 3m double sided tape still on the back but I was able to remove it easily enough with a safety razor and sand it smooth and reattach them with rubber cement.
B00IJ445G4|5|Did the job!
B00EY4RJ66|3|HAd to go buy another one.. After a month it went out and was leaking gain... Not too happy but for the price it worked well =)
B0007ZFTOA|5|A good product for my oil lube bearings on our boat trailer.
B000B8UPCY|5|Excellent Product
B002SINBRQ|5|No issues.  Looks well made
B00LI1LK90|4|Nice
B00MSU5Y1U|5|works great
B0051SG0JQ|1|Ran filter for 10k miles which is In accordnance with toyota's recommendation, when using their synthetic oil.  Upon removal, I found the filter deformed and had holes in it!  I installed this filter myself and torqued it properly on installation.  My advice is stick with an oem Toyota filter!
B0031I4HMK|5|Awesome product fits great
B00FGLJNSI|5|everything I excepted it to be good quality
B0009IQZ2K|5|It does what it says.. It's durable and does what it suppose to.
B00HYHXED2|3|I found, as did a buyer before me, that these are only fair at covering areas that get pretty messy in the Wintertime slush season.  The right side is short going up toward the firewall.  The left side makes no attempt to protect the rise in the floor of my MKZ hybrid version of the car.  Finally,I saw no upfront information that would indicate these are not American-made.  I would have paid the extra money for WeatherTech liners if I'd known these are foreign-made.
B0050SYSC8|5|Excellent delivery time and product.
B009IK6US4|4|Easy to install, serves its function well.
B00QLDDC50|4|Lots of fun!
B0078SG3IK|4|After one year of use, the screws my original frame rusted, and I was unable to remove the plate from the frame. Otherwise, a very unique & attractive frame, that's why I ordered another.
B00HAWLFA0|5|Great!! Great fit great price
B00Z6KLT2C|5|It worked great but didn't fix my problem.  I guess the fuel is evaporating out of the carb. not flowing back ti the tank.
B0009JRVWC|4|Fixed my broken crank.  Just like the original one, so it might break again.  I will have to be careful
B011LAYS32|5|simply AMAZING!!!!!  after installing my rrc intake mani with skunk2 70mm tb,  i have had nothing but problems getting the old style tps to work so it surge like a vacuum leak anyways decided to take the plunge and try this ACUITY hall Effect TPS since the price was perfect and way cheaper  than KTUNED hall effect tps.  All i have to say is my driveabilty is way better and even smoother than stock :)
B0041ME77A|5|Great
B005CW9S0Y|5|Light weight.  Well made and works great!
B000O30BW0|1|Doesn't fit right.  Add says it'll fit my 2005 750 ... but paper that came with says it doesn't.  I installed anyways and sure enough.  The linkage binds ...
B00GSAUHB8|5|I LOVE IT, IT IS SO EASY TO FOLD AND UNFOLD AWESOME!!
B001O07VI4|5|Worked great!
B000IY9FSG|5|very good
B009DJQJIG|5|Fit perfect!
B0015GKRPG|1|DOES NOT FIT EXTENDED CAB AS LISTED, CALLED GIBSON, THEY SAID THAT WEBSITE FITMENT IS WRONG AND TO SEND IT BACK, WHICH I DID, WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY TO SEND IT BACK FOR THEIR ERROR
B00BSG3AIE|5|Aleady reviewed these but since I had to purchase twice to get the amount of bulbs necessary for RV, I get to review again.,....these work great.  Find my other review.  Shouldn't be to far from this one.
B001KQD7YY|4|Working good
B00OSA16OW|5|It's pretty simple so not much to say
B000C8ODP8|5|No issues, great product at this price!
B00IDSIBV6|5|These lights are well made and appear to be very durable.  I am using them on a SCUT to provide additional targeted lighting when working at night.  The only issue I had with the lights is the bracket that holds the lights is just a bit too wide and when the bold to hold the light in position is tightened the edges of the bracket turn up from their mount (see picture).  Not a big deal but it looks odd.  I fixed it by putting a couple of SS washers between the bracket and light.  I would definitely recommend this light set again.
B00HE8HBPS|2|Not the right part for the odyssey TPMS, but I used it's parts to rebuild the original TPMS. No problem Mon.
B00SDQP8Q4|5|I used three of them on three of my 5 tool boxes
B007ZGE7MO|5|Perfect fit for our 2014 chevy cruze. Looks great and definitely worth buying.
B00EC0Z50O|5|Love it. Fit perfectly. finally I dont have a broken mirror. :)
B00CTUSEMU|5|good
B00ADFB6GO|5|Fast shipper, fit my 1996 318ti perfect.  Thanks
B007ZD3UHA|5|Went right in and fit well. Just had to reprogram windows for the auto close feature which only takes a minute
B00002243X|5|Great jumper cables - got the longer length - makes it easer and elements the need to be nose-to-nose for jumps.  Have used them once to help out someone else and they worked well.
B003TTL0TE|5|Great product easy to use, works as designed.
B000C4087Y|5|This fit my 2014 Subaru WRX, remember to fill the filter with oil before replacing it.
B004NKYE0A|5|I purchased this along with the Standard Motor Products VP1T EGR Valve Position Sensor and changed them as a unit. The gasket on the EGR valve was damaged, but I just reused the old one with no problems. I put this on a 1995 F-150 about 6 months ago. It's been working fine and the price was right. What else is there to say?
B00JJ3R8RC|5|Arrived quickly and looks better than the one offered by the Sanders campaign.
B000WZ4KBS|5|Good!!
B000JFJLP6|5|Never has let me down. I even jump out in traffic and jump other peoples cars. I'm their hero... lol
B00HVLXREC|5|Absolutely perfect OEM filter component.  Genuine Mercedes part.  Great service as well.
B0002NIFW0|1|Tag came unwrapped and all scratched.
B0031I4HMK|5|Rotors fit great on a 2005 Equinox. I've been driving with them a few months and no issues.
B005JIQJOY|5|K&N, what else do you need to know when purchasing quality air filters.  The fit was perfect for my car and I have noticed an improvement in gas milage especially when I am towing.  Varies between 3/4 to a mile more per gallon which is great when I have to travel a couple hundred miles for bass tournaments.
B0000AXYA0|5|Really seems to stick to the under carriage of my car.  I think it will really help with rust.  I will say that I feel you should use it in a well ventilated area.  I used it in my garage and could see the fumes in the air.  The smell was pretty strong for awhile...although not totally unpleasant.
B001OMLEFI|5|Install was easy and it looks great!  Well worth the money.
B000G1MBTG|3|Our dog slips on the ramp so we put a none slip strip on the ramp and it's workable.
B000C2CKH2|4|Price was higher that other sources...  This part is the only solution to my repair.
B000BRFQLK|4|kinda flimsy, put works as it should.
B00IKEVI86|4|A little loose for the 7/8ths bar, and the throttle doesnt stop where it should. They look good and will work fine with a little tweaking
B00P7IGX7E|1|did not fit, the fitment was way off. could no use but easy return process.
B003NBFMMY|5|Bought this to go on a trip to the mountains of North Georgia.  The car ride there was about 8 hours.  It rained for at least 6 of those hours.  I was worried because all of our sleeping bags were stored in this cargo bag and it was riding on a rack attached to the back of our car.  Much to my surprise, when we got there, everything was dry.  I know it is supposed to be a rainproof bag, but I have done enough camping to know that rainproof doesn't always mean &#34;rainproof&#34;.  This bag is indeed rainproof.<br />Bought this together with Highland 1042000 Hitch Mounted cargo carrier
B00JJZCDPC|5|This stool is what I'm perched on right now. The seat could be softer but it's strong enough to hold me up without making me feel like it's going to collapse under me. I'm a hefty guy so I was concerned about the strength of the stool - this stool is a good bet if you have that concern.
B00ONIXQZG|5|Adds just the right amount of finish to refresh dull grey looking tires...happy with purchase.
B006RQ44O4|5|Works great on 2013 ram 2500.
B004Y0WE0G|5|good product fit well ; i recomend
B000CPI5Z0|5|Great quality and value.
B00VXVXFKW|5|Is as purchased,  A+ Seller
B004QPKYS8|5|Excellent boots!
B00BY2NE4C|1|Wow I have not reached out to delta but would expect similar response as seen in previous reviews.  I should have paid closer attention. Do purchased the light 2 month ago install was okay no major issues until about 5 uses in amber lights not working and the first fancy expensive light bulb went bad.  So far the product has been disappointing.  Let's see what delta customer  service responds. ....
B00GWFC0LY|4|Works great. Nice sturdy handle.
B0068EOE3Q|5|real upgrade on my bike thank's
B00A7B7QJA|5|Fast shipping and great fit.

B003LIRKTM|1|Garbage!!! Fiberglass only lasted 1 day
B007TY0G1I|5|Gave as gift.
B00ABKSAJW|5|Works just as expected. No fogging on the visor. Soft material and comfortable fit.
B00K544IZY|5|Perfect fit!
B00FALVXEQ|5|I didnt know what to expect with this I saw the you tube video and thought that I could use something like this on my trucks diamond plate tool box. SO I got it and started to follow the instructions on the bottle... I used a porter cable 7424xp polisher and and orange polish pad to remove all the oxidation. When I was done I had a diamond plated mirror finish tool box. I was impressed 100% with the product. This is my secret metal polish that all my friends dont know about. If you need to polish metal and you want great results with easy to apply and remove, this is what you need...
B000E5ZJ4I|2|This is the third latch I have installed on my 2005 . It needs to be all metal!!
B00M5FJY96|5|Work great and fast delivery Five Stars here.
B00O7X97XM|5|Great
B00KGYQ2WU|1|I open the package and as I squeezed one to pick it up, it fell into pieces. Need i say more? I returned these.
B00SIHSA7M|5|Fit my 98 Honda Civic perfectly.  No tool installation.
B00COYNZJ8|1|Last about 2 months before it began to flake as others have mentioned. Had to replace after just one summer. While it's a great novelty item, it is made extremely cheaply. Save your money and get something sturdier.
B006JRJ5L8|4|Good item! Just what I needed.
B00DRHL458|5|Dope spoiler.
B0085FP0BG|5|Perfect fit.
B00ENYJNZM|2|Clay not as pliant as expected; a bit hard thus does not catch dirt as much.
B000ALGXTG|1|Does not absorb as stated.  Found better drying towels
B00393ND6S|5|perceive
B004C6TYGO|4|Nice fit. Easy installation. It did not come with bolts.
B003VAYK3Y|5|This is great. Love it, stronger than the one I replaced.
B003554TB8|5|It didn't leak and nobody tried to rip it open on our 5 day cross country move.
B004BFW0EO|4|Works well, but easily can score paint if you use it for too long.
B000C122X0|5|Great replacement! I took the old one out and put this one in within 10 minutes on my Acura TL!
B007S0LDME|2|Did not control odor at all for me so I stopped using the product and will not purchase it again.  I do wonder if the fact that I had been using other products in my tanks before using this treatment effected its ability to work properly.  I did try several things and ran through at least 4 tanks to see if with continual use, my results would approve, but no luck...
B004HIJO5S|4|Great fit for my f150
B003BZD03K|5|This will help my hose not restrict the water
B00SH1SN6C|5|A+++++ service and product
B001JT1IWU|5|Perfect length for a JK unlimited if you are running from the tailgate along the side and under the carpet to the dash.  Good quality cable and connectors
B00K6BRC9U|5|Works as expected
B000N3FB76|1|Does not come with set screw
B007N6YSCU|4|The parts arrived fast and fit perfectly. The only thing i would change is they don,t last. I have to change them every two years or so.
B009EDQUHG|5|Highly recommended
B000JWT7RQ|5|Perfect fit - pleased with quality.
B00FJ5LBOA|4|Great product.
B00BCRMBGQ|2|Because of the length, a little hard to apply evenly, took a couple of tries.  Just one tiny edge not totally down and the whole thing curled up from the heat and rolled up.
B00FX40C9C|5|Bosch typically makes expensive high end wiper blades.  The SteelTech line is a very affordable line newly released by Bosch.  They are 6 to 9 dollars per wiper blade depending on size.  I got one wiper to try out, but I need two for my front windshield.  When I told my husband that I wanted to get the other one so they match, he was all upset thinking that Bosch would be expensive and told me I should just have bought a pair of something else.  But then when he looked up the other wiper, he really excited to see this line and all excited that it was Bosch for a good price.  For me, personally, I don't really care about brand, and usually buy whatever is at Costco on the theory that Costco stocks good products. But, if you care about brand, then I guess Bosch is the best and now they are affordable.<br /><br />For wiping the windshield, this wiper blade was totally fine.  Like I said, I'm not a consieur and I usually get whatever is sold at Costco without even noticing what brand it is.<br /><br />Online shopping for a wiper blade was also an excellent experience and my first time getting wiper blades this way.  The Amazon page for these blades has a drop down bar to enter your make and model and year of car, and then it tells you what blades fit your car.  This was great, because I could get my car registration and then enter the info and then order.  I also double checked blade size on Toyota's website, because I am paranoid.  In store, I always take too long to pick out the size of wiper blades for my car because it's confusing.
B0023VIZ7Y|4|The tail light looks like a perfect match. I was even able to re-use my original wiring and lights.
B009DK1C82|5|As described
B001G4Z5J0|5|This is perfect for additional cargo when traveling.  It fits perfectly on our 2015 Jeep Wrangler.  We had extra space in the Jeep when using this.  Overall, worth the price.
B00K7X8WBY|5|Love them so cute fit perfectly in my Chevy Cruze :)
B007MVAVAY|5|Great!
B00GYI1ZEW|4|Good quality for the price. My seats look a lot better now, fits good. Make sure the model of your car is compatible with the cover before buying.
B00TPM298U|5|Fit up perfectly. Husband had it  installed  in less  than 15 mins. The lawn tractor fired right up.
B000EQN0SY|5|The part was an exact replacement for the original part.  No install issues.
B0077FIMN8|5|Just what he was looking for.  VERY fast shipping
B001BK7SVC|5|Just what I wanted and it fits perfectly well.
B00L7X8HWC|5|Super happy with my purchase
B00LBN2O5Y|5|Great product super fast shipping will be ordering again very soon
B003LS2PW4|5|I've had these filters on several different vehicles.  While a little bit expensive at first, they're cheap overall since you only have to by one for the life of the vehicle.  In fact, when I bought my current truck, I took the K&N filter out of the old one and replaced it with the new factory filter from the new truck.  Result.  I bought one filter for two vehicles.
B00CVDNDWQ|5|It is perfect.  I have been building race car role cages off and on for more than 20 years and this is a very nice easy machine to use.  I got the 1 1/2 on 7 in and the 1 in on 5 and they both work fabulous.  I even used the 1&#34; to bend smaller stock and it work well.  Money well spent.
B00063Z0TW|2|Could more accurately be called the Dent May Help Tool.  First off do not ignore the directions and try on a vehicle in the sun.  It just wont work.  I used the tool on several dents and never did get completely satisfactory results.  It did lessen and improve one simple round ding.  The tabs on which the liquid glue is applied seemed to adhere better the first few pulls so make your first pulls count.  I am not sure I would buy or recommend this product.  The concept seems sound but it failed to give me much satisfaction.
B00JQQZAA4|5|Shipping was very fast, and installation was even easier than I'd hoped for.  The antenna mast fit perfectly on my 2001 Sequoia SR5 and works well.  Time will tell as far as durability is concerned, but I am pleased with the purchase.
B00V2T55VC|3|Worked and did what I needed it to do. Gave me the codes off of the truck so that I could fix it. You will need a app on your phone to receive the signals that it puts out.
B00HA1MTYC|5|This auto sunshade fits my 2014 Toyota Corolla windshield perfectly and keeps the car interior cooler. I highly recommend.
B0097MZHZK|5|works great
B000BZIHOU|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00IJQOH1K|4|Small, and good quality. Wish it would come with thread adapters.
B0043C55AG|5|Providess all the needed sizes of metric bits
B000KIH97E|5|Love these driving lights
B00B3L2DQO|4|These were just what my husband needed for his utility cart he was painting to match his John Deere mower.  (Rustoleum makes spray cans of farm equipment paint in John Deere Yellow and John Deere Green - just right for such a project.)  These gave him the perfect finishing touch - see picture.<br /><br />He was originally looking for larger decals, though - apparently no one makes them?
B00ZR7WLEE|2|The lights are what I needed to replace the hot ones that came in our Damon Astoria PE the only dissappointing part is the bulbs it uses are not easy to locate.  I have lost three of the 6 purchased and expect the rest to be our before the years end POOR QUALITY Until they address that issue would not recommend.
B00696Y74O|5|Perfect solution for adding fuel additives. Love it!
B00S1R3T8E|5|the best of the best it's a very worth it!!! yes I like I
B00C80I1CE|4|Let me start off by saying that these are decent quality for the price.  At night, they're pretty much blinding, but don't expect much out of them during the daytime hours.  Installation was very simple if you know what your doing, just make sure you put the signal control box withing an arms reach so your not fumbling for it while driving.  The other plus is that you can mix up the lights in any color configuration you'd like. The Con's:  The control box feels like it came out the Chinese factory, also , you can't stop the lights without turning the whole box off and then back on again which can be a pain after a while.
B00G4SSGU8|5|comfortable!
B001UG0PAI|1|The product came all scratched up.. It had almost a halo scratch effect to it like It happened in the machine or whatever.. They shouldn't have shipped it with it looking like that.. They put the piece of cardboard inside to hide the scratches.. I didn't notice them until three days after it arrived when I took the cardboard out to install onto my car... It didn't fit under my carbon fiber plate holder anyways so I could really care less.. I shot it with my shotgun.. Just figured I'd give yall a heads up on the quality and standards...
B000C10E1W|2|Unless your working area is very clear or you are a glutton for punishment you will want to avoid these. It might be OK if their is lots of room to work in the area of installation. I Have a hoist in my garage that got my Trooper up to a good working height but even so gluing the second seam was very difficult. Because of the downward axle angle holding the boot in place while tightening the clamp is not possible. This is going to take an OTC band tool, another pair of hands and removal of the tie rod end to get the outer boot clamp tight. I could change two complete Honda axles in the time that this QUICK boot took. I will be looking for a bolt together boot when the other side fails.
B00HXJ8MBK|5|I like them very much.
B00BCRMB34|1|I was so excited for these. I have leather seat and I live in Arizona, these were much needed. Once I got them I ran out to my car to find out they don't fit. The seller even shows that it should fit my 2002 Mazda millennia but no :(
B0007N5758|4|as expected.
B0074FR3UE|5|worked great good transaction
B00HJE5GI6|5|Purchased LED's for my turn signals on my 2015 Suzuki M109R. The switchbacks in the front are awesome, very bright white running light, and very bright amber turn signal color. They work exactly as described, and a great upgrade to the standard incandescent bulbs. I added the red LED's for the rear turn signals and they match the rear LED brake light perfectly. They are also very bright and make the bike easier to see. Will definitely purchase these again!!!!
B005MZXF9Q|5|Works Great<br />Would Recommend
B001F1U5D0|1|Dead on arrival.<br />Trying to return this item and go through Amazon maze of multiple emails.
B000E28C7M|5|Awesome and Speedy
B006X8BW0K|4|Great product. Install was a little tough, they weren't very clear instructions. But once you figure it out. Its totally a great product.
B00CF0XF78|4|Works real good.  Make sure you purchase the tool to ease the installation and prevent ripping the boots;
B00B2NM7ZK|5|Good quality
B00Q0C8G4Y|1|Returned the first one because it had scratches in the glass. I was extremely disappointed when I received a replacement a couple days later and it was also scratched ! Very poor quality control. I returned both and will buy a different brand.
B00BXPUK5G|1|I have a 2 keychains break on me
B008G1X6X8|5|Ordered on the 12th got it on the 14th. They fit perfect !
B007H2RR78|5|It came on time and works great
B001UMZ07A|5|excellent...
B00GI2CBIS|4|I love the design of this card shade and also glad with the size. I have a dodge durago and sometimes it is hard to fins such a large one. Most of my windows are tinted so with just this on the front it keeps my suv cool. The only thing i do have to say that is a downfall is that i have to use my car visors to keep the auto shade in place and not to move. This keeps it the most secure. But other than that it does the job great and overall i am very happy with this item.
B00W1WGR5M|5|Fits perfect on my California plates, also a great price...so thats a plus
B00S8OUGHC|5|I received this quickly and easy to install. Its been working great.
B0032YUQHI|3|the quality is nice but it's too small for my 2008 buick lacrosse.
B00PM34RHC|1|Did not fit as stated
B003TLOSS2|5|Good product
B000XTHUHE|1|Amazon said this was compatible with my 2011 Nissan Juke. It is the right length, but doesn't stay on the wiper arm past 3 swipes of the blade. There was no adaptor included, either.
B00B2ATTUE|5|Is very good for safesty for my rv
B009FUF6DM|4|Does the job but why are they white and bright colors that show dirt easily?
B00IMPEWHM|5|fit perfect
B00BQN5SUW|5|Amazingly easy to install only took my husband 10 minutes to install
B000LDIJ72|1|The battery did not work and could not be returned. It's return policy should have been more explicit. We were used to dealing with great Amazon return policies and this did not live up to those expectations.
B00BKNW6WQ|5|Yes it did!!! Perfect fit
B00F6769PW|5|Exactly as needed.  Great transaction!
B0009IQZWU|5|Exact part and prompt delivery.

B009Z1KQ2M|5|it works perfect and has everithing needed for the installation, including the fuse, the cables and even the glue for the gas handle. I was surprised about the very high quality of this product for just 50+ dollars.
B00RMIRLO6|5|All the good things you've heard are true! Removable paint; great stuff!
B004WO15F4|5|Amazing! Installed at 2.5 inches and at 27k Miles. Truck feels like new, rides better than new and no longer bottoms out on bumps and potholes! Would recommend!
B00DWKXZL6|5|good
B00OX5NZLO|5|perfect fit & function - no vibration  fast shipping
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Got this for my ZX6R, pretty much standard for the Chinese HID kits. Small, compact, fits really well inside the fairings. Looks exactly like another brand I paid more for my BMW (wish I knew about this brand). Color seems good, I ordered the 6000K and it seems pure white, though it takes upwards of 2min to get to full temp/color (average for the Chinese HID kits). For the price I would say this is a fantastic HID kit. I would buy it again.
B00CVVUQ50|3|They are good except the one on the hood it's so small
B001C9EP2W|1|sent back, didnt need it
B004I16QKK|5|Perfect fit! It came with all the necessary items for a fast installation.

B00U0YKQAA|4|Nice part.  As advertised.

B0009N0W60|3|I like the look of them but I recently changed my tags and noticed some rust, I'm not sure how much they'll actually hold.
B000CJ42SA|4|Great product, exact fit, beautiful finish! The bad: Packaging damaged and one corner was bent over and damaged. I had to straighten and its not as good as new. Also disappointed no holes to mount. I had to drill my own. Lastly nothing on the back to protect the tailgate cover from scratching the finish on my tailgate. I had to add my own foam strip. All in all happy.
