B00A285OOW|4.0|Well written, a good read for that period. I loved the strength of the Women characters!<br />If you've traveled in England at all, this will connect some dots for the reader.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Amazing realization after watching this that not only were the 3000 casualties involved but also the hundreds of thousands of friends and relatives of those persons.<br />an amazing reflection of history.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It seems like the old days when you with yours friends on sunny afternoon playing Uno, but at the end of the game your friend tells you have to pay to play. Man, that sucks we not friends anymore, you Yeti.
B00C5R8364|4.0|FF a good story teller. Has many twists and turns. Sometimes very graphic, but all and all a good read.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I have this app on both my Kindle Fire and iPad. It's easy to use and offers a good spectrum of news from around the world.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book came recommened to me.  Ironically I kept reading it but found the main character not very believable, only very annoying.  The premise was a good one but the story just didn't deliver.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game I look forward to spending a few minutes a day earning coin to buy different things. I love the new glasier park.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Robert Downey jr. is one of my favorites and I also really am into steampunk. This is a great movie if you like both. I love sherlock holmes and this whole series.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always a great read.  Too bad Harry is getting so old he soon won't be able to stay on the police force. He's a great character,  maybe Connelly can write some prequels, when Harry was young
B00340ESIS|5.0|I've read more than a couple of books about writing, and this is one of the best. Written specifically for screenplays, but adaptable to almost any format. Highly recommend it.
B00F35BV64|1.0|I watched this and the acting was so bad that I just couldn't believe it. Plot was okay, must be a STAR TREK fan to even start to enjoy this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find this app to be the most dead on of any weather app I've used. Very detailed with good graphics.
B0078QYI1G|4.0|This is my first by carolina chocolate drops but I do really like their music. I will have to check out other albums. Overall a good album, couple of songs that might have to grow on me.
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|If you're a music buff from that era (early 70s), then this documentary gives you insight into how some of these greats actually just got their big break on &#34;dumb luck.&#34;
B0094LU2TU|5.0|Very simple.....the second it ended I said &#34;I want to see that again,&#34; and &#34;when is District 10 coming out.&#34;<br />Also great applause for the choice of actors. I can't remember the last time I saw a film and did not recognize a single person in the screen.<br />Lastly, I have has 3 dreams about the film since, the last movie to do that to me was Bambi....I won't tell you how many years ago that was :-)
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies out there. I have all four movies in the series. Its a good series for youngsters
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Rarely have I read such a long book that has kept my attention all the way through. It is evenly paced, successfully weaving the past into the present to create a full story. It deals with current issues well without being jingoistic. One of those books I was sad to finish as the next one has a lot to measure up to.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Number two in the iron man saga. Still have to see number three. Just as good if not better than one.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app does exactly what it advertises and it does it extremely well. I use it extensively as I undertake home improvement and wood working projects.  I consider it a must have addition to any toolbox.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I've loved this miniseries for years and the remastered version of it has brighter colors and Elizabeth's cheeks are so beautifullly rosy. Enjoy!
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|We love The Emperor's New Groove and were excited to see the combo of both movies in one on Blu-Ray. Turned out we love Kronk's New Groove too! Love the convenience of the combo pack. Cute movies.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these novels! Wonderfully written and very imaginative! I borrowed the first novel from my local library and as soon as I finished it I HAD to read the other ones so I just bought the bundle pack! I highly recommend this!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It a great deal . It's awesome and tell your friends to get this app! It's awesomer<br />than any other shooting game! Get it!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|For a free game, it runs smoothly and keeps you entertained. You have to have some patience in wait time to get more energy but all in all good.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|A few incredibles for those who know a bit more than the average person about the subject but a gripping story otherwise.  In some ways it had reworked (but good) bits from earlier Dan Brown story-lines but with different characters and a little of Dr. Strangelove twists overlaid but I still thoroughly enjoyed it as an escape from reality type of read.
193700788X|5.0|And this Sookie Stackhouse story was no exception. Her adventures are as fun, exciting and entertaining as ever. A must have for any Sookie fan.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This item broke soon after giving to my wife it for Christmas. The sound quality through the front plastic sounded very tinny. Maybe I got a lemon? Its been sitting about since January because we got had to buy a usable case.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|Great new old stuff from Billy and his gang of vault divers.  The package doesn't compare to the original but the DVD with Matt walker makes it worth it.
B0074AGVWK|3.0|Maeve Binchy tells a good story and tells it well. In Full House she shows a mother's concern when the adult children refuse to leave home. They are all to comfortable in their childhood home but they make no contribution to the running of the household or to the expenses. The mother has to use &#34;tough love&#34; but they eventually get the message and peace is restored.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A very good book.  If you liked Vince Flynn, you will like this book.  I hope he writes more like this one.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Excellent story, beautiful scenery. End Hollywooded up. I would definitely recommend this movie to you. The bigger the screen the better .
B000I8ES5C|5.0|This movie is departure from normal Steven Chow films. It has an actual plot that is more than merely a vehicle for gags. The tailor, the noodle maker, the landlord and his wife and the Beast  are all characters out of Chinese Mythology. The interplay of Buddhist and Western ideas is also rather subtle. None of these things should detract from the fact that this is a really really funny film.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Ok, you have to download an additional 900mb, and on my Kindle Fire HD it doesn't offer me the higher graphics options, but even from what I see, that's forgiven.<br />Race, for example, through the streets of Tokyo, accompanied by exciting sound.<br />I miss a cockpit view but that is forgiven, too.<br />Best racer ever, period.
B008RTE066|5.0|I thought I was over this group and here they go with this re-mastered set. I'm very happy about the whole thing. I hope it's as good as the Tragical History Tour album or All you need is CASH, by the Ruttles.
B0000714BP|5.0|Showed the film to my young cousins (17 & 20 years old) - they loved it!!! They could not believe how much fun it was!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Loved the fact that this story is set in Tempe, Arizona and the surrounding area. Made it come to life.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is the best Sci-Fi movie ever done. This remake suffers from having to stand in that shadow but it is still a wild ride. Worth seeing and very enjoyable
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I find this to be one of only a few highly accurate adaptations of 'Jane Eyre'. It is directed and filmed in a unique and appealing way. The actors were quite well chosen for their roles as well. Like every retelling of this amazing story, the theme of Christianity which is weaved throughout the book is all but neglected but all in all this movie is still well done.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|You want insight into one man's misconceptions? DFW leaves a staggering legacy. IJ will give you insight and leave you with a feeling of having experienced someone else's reality.
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|I'm not connecting to Facebook to get coins and I'm definitely not purchasing any. Boards stopped giving coins. Items purchased mysteriously vanished. Coins taken randomly. It was fun until you wanted money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice and easy to use.  Gets the job done.  Glad I picked this app.  Would recommend it to anyone to use.
B003VW54QO|4.0|This film along with a couple of others is sort of the iconic John Wayne film. Yes, its cheesy, and the characters are some what two dimensional but that is also part of the fun in a film like this. The duet sang by Dean Martin and Rick Nelson makes the film worth seeing all by itself
B001C4AFOY|4.0|This is a good movie about Queen Victoria but not the best. It leaves out their relationship after the marriage which I find disappointing and strange. There is a BBC version which details their relationship from beginning to end which makes more sense to me. Ok. So it's called 'The YOUNG Victoria' but they could have given more details on their marriage while she was still YOUNG.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I connect this device from my iPhone 4S to play YouTube and Netflix videos. It works great. Apparently, it's not a mirror display of what's on the iPhone.
B000W94FE6|5.0|This book is a masterpiece, it is a book that everyone should read. It gives us detailed techniques on how to become extremely creative and happy at one's work.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best disaster movie ever made.  I definitely recommend this one to all
B000QDA7OU|5.0|i cannot wait to get this, i enjoyed it years ago and am happy to finally order it on dvd.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of 'Sense & Sensibility'. It is humorous, lovely, and directed very well. I highly recommend it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Sharp contrasts in this book, some very funny moments and some very sad ones.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the one liners from Jamie's friend Rose.  Like another reviewer stated, I found myself dreading the orphanage chapters, but they truly give you an understanding of the Misremembered Man.  Definitely Recommend!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am impressed with the story and the plot twist. Zachary is sometimes a little over the top portraying Spock, but I love him loving Uhura.<br />JJ Abrams re-imagining of the ST universe has definitely grown on me. I'm concerned that if he doesn't have a hand in the next one that there'll be a disappointment to the fans. As long as he's producing and Lindelof is writing I'm in.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|One has to approach this book with an open mind. Many, perhaps even most,<br />will think it borders on &#34;heresy.&#34; But the historical facts seem to<br />be accurate.  And I found that one can still believe in the teachings<br />of the Christ without believing in any of the legend that grew around<br />him.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Still don't know who done it, but am enjoying the search for the killer.  This is one more example why British television gets so much positive feedback.  It is quality without any apology for being on the small screen.  Had to buy an episode after losing power in a storm -- and therefore an episode -- there was no question of just missing one episode.  Every minute is not to be missed.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|My kid loves this game. Sometimes even his dad uses my phone to play. I've never played but they both say its fun. For me it keeps him busy when I'm trying to pay at a register :-)
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The picture on the blu ray release is grainy and has a very poor picture.  The audio on the release is very poor and does not work with stereo.  The menu in the blu ray also does not work.  You are unable to move around and select anything else.  I hope this release is fixed and re-released.<br /><br />The concert is great.  I love Madonna but this is a very poorly done release.  I guess I'll just stick to watching this on Epix for now because it's better quality there.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Edit:  The menu is tricky.  You have to repeatedly press the left arrow or go to the left in order to select other options.
B00371XIP8|5.0|One of the few really great sequals. Just what took them so long? Would love to see them make it a trilogy
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I loved the movie, and expected the blu-ray to have all of the special features. In fact, I waited an additional two weeks for the blu-ray (instead of downloading the movie on iTunes) SPECIFICALLY to gain access to the complete set of special features. Director commentary is the MOST IMPORTANT special feature, which I found out was PURPOSEFULLY omitted from the amazon blu-ray. I later found out that each retailer (Best Buy, Target, Amazon, iTunes) has a different set of special features, but that none is totally complete. How infuriating is that? SHOULD I have to pay TWICE just to get the director's commentary?<br /><br />It wouldn't have been so bad if they mentioned this on the product description. Amazon should've labeled this product &#34;Star Trek Into Darkness, RIP-OFF version.&#34;
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved this game but it has now glitched twice to the point that I have lost all my coins, stats, upgrades, points and gems. I am now at zero for everything so I am done with this game. also the pop up ads after every time you play are annoying and ridiculous.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Absolutely love it!<br />Dave Grohl is by far the nicest rock star.<br />Great, compelling story.<br />Great music.<br />Best doc I've seen all year!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Wish more was offered. Game wise. More popular games. That's it for now. No more to say. This should be shorter responce
B003O86FMW|5.0|There were times I could not put my kindle down, I had to know what was going to happen to the characters next.  I was so glad that I had already purchased the thrird book because I felt the end of this book was so abrupt; I had to start the third book that night & read until I could not keep my eyes open any longer.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Nothing but nothing can EVER get close to the original Wizard of OZ... Not only did it set its standards  for its time and effects , acting, story and every thing you could think of but it only fell short to only one other considered the greatest of all time from a  story written by Margaret Mitchell. How could these two legendary movies ever compete. it was simply impossible and the likes will never happen again and still to this day they are two of the most cherished movies in history and will be for countless generations to come.. One for a heartbreaking kiss & walking out the door in the fog and rain & one for both children and adults alike to prove there is no limits to the imagination and incredible story telling taking viewers over the rainbow...... Which brings up to the age where  a studio would even dare to take on and  try to make a prequel to one of most beloved stories of all time... So now here is the OZ Great and powerful... does it is completely hit the mark...no.. but could any attempt really accomplish that?? yes there were parts what were a bit cheesy. But the Land of OZ is so very complicated on many different levels. First there was the story of the sisters in Oz and A con man who really tried to save the day. There was a really nice story line and the morals behind it truly could be felt. Oz did try to do well by Masterpiece but it did fall a bit short. The premise was certainly intriguing and certain things were incredibly sad on how things in OZ came to be...The story did try to send out a great message to all.. that acting was decent... the effects were over way done yet beautiful to behold... Yes this is a takeoff on Wicked and its gives a decent background in the land of OZ and how the \\"true\\" wicked witch came to be.. but will never ever be surpassed by the legendary performance of Margaret Hamilton. OZ was way over computerized with effects but it did try = way to hard. Did it have the best story line ..no.. but when you watch this film you cant help but smile in certain areas of this film. It tried to hard. But then again how in the hell can some one even try to top a movie in 1931 that set the standard for almost every movie that followed. OZ is a fun movie as times, and surprising on how the wicked became wicked but really didn't go far enough to justify how that all came about.. maybe this should have been broken up in to two movies because there is so much wealth of material and stories to tell and what was left out or didn't tie in to the classic...Oz tried do do right by the original but it tried way to hard and yet still didn't have enough time to tell the whole story. For fans of the story OZ will disappoint and excite at the same time... what could have been and should of. But in no means is this truly a bad film. It falls in the middle. Any one who loved the Wizard of OZ should see this. Will if fill all their expectations and tie everything in ...NO.. but the story as it tried to tell in a single movie is a decent tribute and an intriguing prequel to a masterpiece that was written and made in to a legendary, standard setting film before most of us were even born...  OZ is Worth renting or owning, there are some fine tributes and story lines to try to tie it in but in no way does it touch the classic. Yes  get the original for it is timeless. and deserves to be in every household for it touches the young old  a like and will never stop bringing viewers somewhere over the rainbow. OZ the great and powerful is a hit and miss at the same time but certainly deserves a viewing to those who wonder  and love the original and gives a tantalizing back drop of the land called OZ but could have been so much more.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|MYSTERY FULL OF INTRIGUE WITH PLENTY OF TWISTS AND TURNS AND MURDERS WITH A VERY SURPRISE ENDING AT THE VERY LEAST!!
B00008G8M4|1.0|I ordered this DVD because I like the movie.  However, the quality of this DVD is poor.  You will need the subtitles because the audio borders on nonexistent!  Audio fades in and out------mostly out.  What happened to quality control?
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey, and will admit that this is not his best movie.  That being said, it kept my attention, and I loved the end of the movie.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I think the movie is excellent for all ages especially age 5 and 8 year olds.Its a very good movie.

0783235666|5.0|The movie is so good as I remembered it so long ago its very good.Not recommended for children to watch it though adults only.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is probably my favorite Orson Scott Card book. It is in my opinion a classic, very enjoyable. and captivating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Someone recommended that we take a look at Downton Abbey a while back and one evening we decided to try out our Prime options and decided to watch from the beginning as the complete series is available via Streaming. After maybe 2 of the first season shows we were hooked. Have watched most of the series now and love it. We watch them one after another and sometimes late in the night. Will actually watch the entire series again!
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Great true story of an inspirational coach.  In the world of bad news, how refreshing to hear about a contemporary hero.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|as the seasons progress.  at least in season 2 she doesn't win every case.  Still has a few of the trappings of your typical &#34;big 3 network&#34; show... but hey, it's not AMC
B007XNAQLA|5.0|It was owesome as always expecting from rtf with addition of jean Luke ponty with his flourish lines . Bravo .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|UPGRADES MAKE IT EVEN MORE AMAZING. NOW THAT THE MINIONS CAN GO TO THE BEACH ITS AWESOME. I LIKE THE WAY THE MINIONS SCREAM
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I gave up tryimg to see it. 3.99 down the drain. good luck . It sounds like a good movie
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such an excellent show. Occasionally strays too far from being true to the period,  no doubt to satisfy the social norm expectations of today's audience,  but engrossing all the same
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is awesome but I think it is to short. I would love for the next one kingdom rush frontiers to come out. My friend always plays it on his iPod and I am hoping it will come out soon.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book was recommended to me by some friends. It wad a little hard to get used to the written in writing style since it was from the view of a 5yr old. It was like he was experiencing everything on a 5yr delay. I enjoyed the story though.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The characters and plot seemed real, and it was great to see how their stories intertwined and resolved.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Book is pure trash.  13  months  served is nothing compared to the life time of misery drug dealers sentence to youths.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a fun game with lots of different locations and lots of seek and find actions.  Also has matching and word FUN. Great fun.Www
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Usually I don't like gory movies but this one actually was very interesting because of demonic nature of the whole movie.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great writing and superb acting make this a fantastic series. Olivia Coleman shines along side David Tennant who provides his usual stellar performance
B005LAII80|5.0|This is approximately 1 million times better than Stallone's interpretation of the british comic series. It is a day in the life of this character and it is delivered beautifully and without an excess of uneeded angst.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I can't get enough of this show!!! David Tennant is completely brilliant. BBC at its finest! Can't wait for more!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The audio on this bluray is TE-RRI-BLE<br />if see and listen your blurays through a soundbar or only<br />the tv speaker is not bad, if you have a surround system<br />there's almost cero sound coming from the front right/left channel.<br />HORRIBLE SOUND ENCODING.<br />The concert I love, great show, but very very bad product quality.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo was best picture of 2012 and earned an Oscar. I sat on the edge of my recliner spell bound from the beginning to the end of the movie. I like it was based on a true life event. Towards the end as the 6 hostages and Affleck finally got in the airplane; I shouted in my bedroom GO, GO until the plane finally got off the runway and into the sky. I then clapped and cheered once they were safe. The movie kept my full attention until the end. Argo is a keeper in my movie library. Sarah H.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I highly reccomend this video. In net, it delivers a wonderful alternative reality that is believable with well developed characters.<br /><br />Read on Rotten Tomatoes or IMBD if you want better reviews.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|Man of Steel has everything, spectacular action, a good story, and great acting. The effects were excellent and made for some amazing fight scenes between the kryptonians and some great scenes on Krypton. The story was good, it starts off on Krypton with Jor-El and Lara, Zod and his minions being banished to the phantom zone, and it adds some new elements to the original Superman story. Soon, Superman is sent to Earth, the movie then speeds up to Clark as an adult and shows him experiencing flashbacks to his childhood of his interactions with his Earth parents Jonathon and Martha Kent. Clark later becomes Superman when he finds a kryptonian ship where through some technology is explained his origin. Soon after Zod comes to Earth (freed from the phantom zone) searching for something Superman has. After this, Superman has to defend the Earth from Zod and the titanic fights occur. All through out the story there was great acting from Henry Cavil as Superman, Amy Adams as Lois, Russel Crowe as Jor-el, Kevin Costner as Jonathon Kent, plus many more talented actors.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of my favorate authors, have read all of his books and cannot wait for the fourth to come out.  One can be assured that his presentation of Afganistan history and culture is accurate.  He is not only knowledgable but a sensitive writer.  Presents his characters with great feeling.
0345806786|5.0|FINALLY!!!<br /><br />This will be brief, because \\"The Shining\\" itself is a worldwide classic that needs no introduction. It is, for my money, the scariest book ever published and one of the five or so best novels Stephen King has written. It's a five-star book all the way, and may I add that what makes it scary is exactly what Stanley Kubrick took out when he made the movie: THE CHARACTERS. The Torrances are real people, flesh and blood, not simple cyphers for a stylish bloodbath, and their descent into a wintery hell in the Overlook Hotel is the stuff true nightmares are made of. As a husband and a father I always root for Jack Torrance, every time I read the book, and always sink into despair with Wendy and Danny as we see him gradually fade into darkness. A terrifying tale of a haunted man in a haunted house.<br /><br />My REAL review is for the fact that, finally, at long long last, they're putting out a trade paperback edition of this novel. For those of us who've seen so many relatively inferior writers given the trade PB treatment (Dean Koontz, Clive Barker, etc.) while Stephen King, one of the 20th (& 21st) century's greatest writers, in ANY genre, stick it out for years and decades in the same old mass market paperbacks, edition after edition, this is a godsend. OK, yes, about ten years ago there were a couple of his novels given the trade treatment, but the horribly un-frightening day-glo covers almost guaranteed the experiment would be a failure, and it was, and it was back to mass markets. Recently \\"Night Shift\\" and \\"The Stand\\" came out as trade paperbacks, and now \\"The Shining,\\" thank God and Anchor Books, and I sincerely hope they sell enough copies (with a cover that cleverly hints at the movie for those only familiar with the book's cinematic incarnation) to keep going: \\"Carrie,\\" \\"'salem's Lot,\\" \\"The Dead Zone,\\" etc. etc. etc. Keep 'em coming. I have all of them in hardback, but I'll get the trades too. I hope I'm not alone.

B00EMJD6TC|1.0|Ever wanted to see a pure zombie movie? Well this is it--written, directed and acted by zombies.  Zero thought but big dollars.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was good. It was hard to keep up with due to the many storylines going at the same time. I prefer a less complicated novel.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Well done movie - I was struck by how little some things have changed in our congress and the way it works. I also did not realize what a narrow thing it was for the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. This movie gets two thumbs up - one for it's historical significance and the other for a wonderful job Daniel Day-Lewis does portraying Lincoln. A very believable performance.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|wasn't what I thought it was isn't what I thought it was and deleted it fairly fast so have no more to say

B000VZYPB4|5.0|excellent writing, great cast.  One of the best comedies on tv today.  In the same vein as Seinfield where every day life is funny.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I loved both Star Trek movies from JJ.  I loved this one even more than the first and I didn't think that was possible.  The quality of the Phaser is great in my opinion.  I've bought many, many things from Qmx and if you've purchased from them before you're certainly not disappointed with the Phaser.  I've read and heard the complaints about this set, and I have to agree somewhat, if you're looking for a mountain of special features this is not for you.  If you're not a huge Trek fan or a fan of prop replicas than this is definitely not for you.  I knew what I was getting and got it early so I'm overly impressed with the quality of the phaser and it looks great on the stand!  It looks even cooler next to the Qmx Enterprise replica from the 2009 film.  I hope Amazon and Qmx continue to produce these exclusive collectibles.  There is one major complaint I have... The box is cheap regular old cardboard... it's packed well and protected well in styrofoam(thankfully) but the box leaves little to be desired.  Same as the replica from the first one... I'd certainly pay and extra 20 or 30 for a proper &#34;collectors box&#34; or case, other than that... This is awesome.  The price is great too, especially if you have seen or purchased from Qmx before.  Worth the wait!  Worth the money!! Can't wait for number 3!

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The costumes, scenery, history and the actors are fantastic.  I even held a Downton video party.  I served tea, English muffins, and English tea cookies.  I hooked 2 of my best friends in viewling the video.  They also love the video.  We are so looking  forward to  Season 4.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I love the movie. It was scary as hell and done well. I recommend it to any who like a scary movie. Only 5-10% cheese factor which is LOW for this Genre.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My great nephew turned me on to this and my grandson (2yr old) likes it and thinks the red bird looks like the mascot for the ISU cyclones! I like the weird sounds and black eyes which are funny to me.

B000VMBXNA|5.0|The Uncommon reader gave me a witty and believable view into the life of Her Majesty with a cliff-hanger ending...
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I was distracted enough by the poor sound management that I can't review this film on the merits of its story and execution.  In order to tolerate the booming background noise, I had to turn the volume down, but every time the scene returned to dialogue, I had to turn the volume back up.  Up, down, up, down.  Audio technology has come far enough that this shouldn't be an issue for filmmakers.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|am enjoying the series and finding how thing are going like a visit from pals it's good to see them
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The pace is incredibly slow, there's very little action. Sally Field made the movie passable; she did a great job acting. If not for her performance I'd have to rate it a 1 Star.
B008MM9630|3.0|This is an easy play game but see to it that you have friends that play it as well other wise you sit like me and can't use your magic words.

B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Great movie, it amazes me how one man could have helped so many Parent, Children, Great Grandchildren, and perhaps Great-Great Grandchildren. How many Schindler's Jews exist today? Perhaps ten thousand? Compassion can save thousands.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|It's really everything people say it is.  It's extremely practical, you can immediately use the tools in this book.  I really really really suggest it.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|After the first 30 minutes, you are left with only 1 original Joe. Mysteries in the story are blandly concluded with rushed conclusions, causing the story to really suffer. Should have kept (spoiler alert) Duke alive. Brought back all of the other characters (Scarlet). Storm Shadow would never change sides.
031603441X|5.0|This autobiography proves why. Everyone knows and respects Keith Richards for his musical arrangements, unbelievable longevity and when you read this you'll find out just what it is about Keith. He's down to earth and sincere. He's not just in the business to make money, but he has a real deep appreciation of music and the people who created it's roots.<br /><br />His sense of humor and recollections are a treat for any rock affectionado still loving that magic that we have lived through and the insights of what magic he lived through brings so many memories home. Loved the part about 5 strings, so many guitarists I know always wondered how Keith got that sound. Fun!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife is extremely well written and well played.<br />It  has retained a consistent quality throughout the four seasons I simply don't want it to end and am looking forward to Season Five.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Another well written and entertaining novel.  I have been on a Gaiman kick for a while and I might just read another.
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|(based upon theatre viewing)<br /><br />Above-mentioned \\"flaws\\" include too many close-ups of Oprah who none the less is outstanding, throughout. I have no idea of any background interest by the megastar but I kept imagining in the theatre, that the Director and Editor was perhaps scared to make her \\"supportive\\" of Forest Whitaker. He is excellent, as well. (Was he the star?).<br /><br />A secondary criticism is in the \\"aging\\" of the stars. Forest looks exactly the same in 1974 as he did in 1954. Oprah ages about 30 years in one 5 year period.<br /><br />We also get a small, and very unnecessary and depressing soap opera involving the neglected Oprah and the next door neighbor dude. Super acting, yes, but what a mistake.<br /><br />That plus too many administration recollections...the Eisenhower years are very well done (although Robin Williams is pretty awful as Ike). Then we get the Camelot years, but Jack looks about 27 years old. Another good (albeit disturbing) set of scenes involves the reluctant war monger but socially beneficient LBJ. Then we find the older and wiser Nixon, surprisingly well represented - when it was all said and done, the \\"crook\\" came up with enterprise zones for minorities.<br /><br />The Carter and Reagan years could have been cut. This Reviewer feels that Reagan, although a man of vision (Welfare Reform and \\"47% pay no Fed. taxes\\", etc.), was past his prime. Still, the very cold portrayal here, is quite unnerving. Here's a Leader who took a bullet for his Country.<br /><br />So, sadly, we get another coulda-shoulda from \\"Hollywood\\". Another movie twenty minutes too long.<br /><br />Positives are too numerous to mention: it's a great review of the Civil Rights movement through the eyes of a family, a Father, who must look away from political machinations six feet away from him and serve cookies to segregationists; a Son, equally concerned about his country, but willing to demonstrate (and take his Life in his hands).
1608871452|5.0|The pictures in it are amazing, I love the details that went into it. I didn't realize how good the quality of it would be but it's a must have for supernatural fans.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Superb acting, great story line.  This is what is really going on in Washington, and is a perfect example of the corruption of our elected leaders.  The lesson to be learned: quit voting for the same corrupt officials.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season Three of Downton Abbey continues the story of the lives within the Downton Abbey. It will keep you drawn and compelled to anxiously await the next episode.  Because of the great story lines and the details into the character lives, I watch the series when the season comes available to watch more than one episode at a time.  it is like reading a book, you want to turn the page to see what happens next.  Season 4 looks like it will be just as wonderful.  Enjoy
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|A well done film that extrapolates human nature to explore the role of emotions, and our group nature versus our individuality.  I found myself simply wanting the characters to \\"feel\\".  As that is a major part of the story line, I call it a success.
1579128955|5.0|This book exceeded expectations regarding pictures and descriptions. It is an easy read for kids and gives examples of what the elements are used for in the real world. The author interjects personal views or insights into each element, which are interesting.<br />I also bought the cards to accompany this book, and would recommend them to everyone.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was helpful when I needed to do my home work<br /><br />Thank God for you or I was gonna get in trouble
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. All of the reviews and talking to other readers sounded like it would be a good read. I do not like the voice it was written in. In fact I have struggled to read 50% of this book so far. I had to stop for a while because I found I was reading it to see what the rave reviews were about. So far, I have not found anything...
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Now I want to hike a part of the PCT! I didn't utilize Oprah's comments or questions, the book is plenty meaningful by itself.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This novel is very well written, and I loved the story as told from a young boys point of view. I would recommend this book to my children (ages 13 and 11) as well as to adults.

B00EY8A6BC|3.0|this is a good story, but it way too confusing and not explained very well. I liked the idea of the magic and some was spectacular but I would have to see it again to figure it out.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|Certainly not a serious movie at all but Ben Stiller delivers a hilarious performance with along with co-stars Owen Wilson and Christine Taylor.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Are you that someone who is grieving because the sun has come up again and your loved one is not there to enjoy the sunrise with you? You also wonder what they are doing? Where they are? Is there a God and an after life? Read this book and you will find out first hand from a neurosurgeon his &#34;take&#34; on the afterlife and you will read the last pages knowing that your loved one is enjoying the bliss of the afterlife that we all will get to experience some day with the Almighty. The poem printed at the end will give you comfort in your time of tribulation. It was the subject of my eulogy for my brother-in-law who passed away this year after suffering from MSA for the past two years. Jim could once again speak through me and give comfort to us all that day at the funeral

B0033AI41G|1.0|If you're going to make a movie about a historical figure and his experiences with schizophrenia, it should at least be somewhat accurate so the people who know about at least one of those can get something out of it.<br /><br />Really, the primary problem is that this film is staggeringly insensitive toward everything it portrays, particularly John Nash, schizophrenia, mental illness in general (Pro tip: Love doesn't cure schizophrenia, and there is no cure for schizophrenia. Someone with severe melancholic depression might as well be told to \\"get over it\\" and poof, it would do *nothing* to ease it. Same with schizophrenia, or any other chronic mental illness. End of discussion.), and mental health treatment, even for its time period.<br /><br />You can read the top critical review on why this story is almost entirely fiction. About the only thing it gets right was that there was a mathematician named John Nash and he suffered from mild auditory hallucinations. Also, he was anti-semitic. Not a lot of good to say about him, but you know, severe schizophrenia does destroy the brain in irreversible ways. But there were no visual hallucinations of any kind.<br /><br />Oh, but he wasn't allowed to give any sort of speech like he did at the end, because he was spiteful, psychotic, and no one let him, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />But I can stand that. So the screenwriters were Oscar-fishers with this one, choosing not to portray Nash's real life in any way whatsoever. Things tend to go that way in Hollywood. That's fine.<br /><br />But this is what isn't fine at all: Chronic mental illness, which includes, by definition, schizophrenia, is treated like any mild depressive episode that goes away with time and support. You can't talk someone out of schizophrenia. There is no cure for schizophrenia. None whatsoever. Especially not a good relationship (which Nash never had at any point), since schizophrenia's symptoms can only be managed with medication. ECT is also sometimes used in extremely severe cases.<br /><br />Oh, right, ECT, or Electro-Convulsive Therapy. I'm sure this film scared everyone who could benefit from that, even save their lives, from liking that idea. If you want to know what real ECT is, imagine someone temporarily sedated with a muscle relaxant, one or two electrodes are attached to their head, and controlled bursts of electricity are administered. As this happens, typically for only about 10-15 minutes during which the person is unconscious and can't feel a thing, you know what doesn't happen? Violent spasms. They are almost completely immobile during the procedure and, at worst, have transient headaches afterward, which is, more often than not, totally offset by the fact that it has a very good success rate.<br /><br />ECT is basically a \\"reboot the brain\\" sort of thing. The electricity causes a controlled seizure (hence muscle relaxants that null anything unpleasant, or even unpleasant-looking), which then restarts the brain. It often is of great help for many people with any kind of brain abnormality, since the \\"clean reinstall\\" is not unlike making a PC run smoother if it's been running too long with spyware (pun unintended) and malware, and as the brain starts again, the person essentially feels new. There are other details about it, but the bottom line is that ECT does not suck and does not cause violent convulsions. Nor is the inpatient unit of any psychiatric treatment center particularly unpleasant (I've done my share of work in those units, and believe it or not, it's meant to be a beneficial and healing environment, which it often is.)<br /><br />So that's two counts of simply \\"making stuff up\\" for the sake of drama. So does this film have any saving graces? Sure, Russel Crowe is a damned good actor, and for the script he was handed, he pulled it off beautifully. He essentially only needed to act the part the screenwriters and director had almost completely fabricated, though he wasn't allowed to actually portray schizophrenia in general with virtually any accuracy. Nash alone did not have hallucinations nearly this bad, but the vast majority of people suffering with schizophrenia don't have visual hallucinations. Those that do often see \\"apparitions\\", if they're people, or they see and feel strange things such as their bed comforter turning into snakes, or metal, or insects, for a few examples of many. That's in the absolute worst cases of schizophrenia, which is in itself a rare condition, and an even rarer subgroup have hallucinations besides auditory.<br /><br />So...Where does that leave us? Well, it left me in a state of near-stupor as I watched a complete fabrication of some new John Nash who is absolutely nothing like his real self combined with a portrayal of schizophrenia that was wildly inaccurate, along with the mental health field that, as is often the case, treated like it's a medieval torture that should be avoided.<br /><br />Well, in that case, the story of John Nash is false, the stories of schizophrenia and mental illness in general are false, and the message the entire film gives is astronomically destructive: Schizophrenia (or any chronic mental illness) can be cured...through talking them out of it. Which has never worked in the history of time, because that's the equivalent of talking someone out of a heart attack. There is no fundamental difference in practicality there, though the former is simply destructive. But Crowe at least entertains us with his goofy shenanigans, so that's why the Academy gave him the Oscar. Good for him, but boo to the screenwriters and director who didn't have the guts to portray him accurately, which was not impossible and would have made for a more interesting film, really. There's no rule that says the main character has to be likable for the movie to be enjoyed. Then again, Crash, the most racist movie I've ever seen since about the '70s began, also won Best Picture, and that, too, was the exact opposite ofreality in favor of something that, well, fished for Oscars.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind throwing reality, John Nash's actual life, and the nature of chronic mental illness into the trash bin and just want to watch a fantasy character make his way almost comically into a maniacally stupid forced ending, then I guess...Actually, no, don't watch it. You could be revolted at how carelessly insensitive and astonishingly exploitative this film is.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This is such a great show. I hope it wins tons of awards and hits the magical 5 season mark.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game but once you upgrade the devices there is nothing else to spend bananas on beside a couple costumes.  Maybe cash them in for Gru coins...

B006CHML4I|4.0|i bought this watch a little over a week ago. as soon as i received it in the mail i set the time and the date (which is not difficult despite what some reviewers claim). i set the time to my phone and after a week the times still match up.<br />this watch has an automatic/mechanical movement it will stop after a while of not wearing it (probably a day or two however i have not stopped wearing it so I'm not sure how long) and need to be reset, also it wont be as accurate as a quartz movement. That is how all automatic/mechanical watches are and not a downside of only this watch therefor it is no reason to lower the rating of the watch.<br />so if either of those things bother you then i suggest not purchasing this watch or any other automatic/mechanical watch. however if you'd like a good looking, fairly accurate automatic watch for a very reasonable price then i fully recommend this seiko 5.<br />the reason i give it four stars and not five is because there is no way to manually wind the watch by turning the stem and as others have stated the band does seem to bleed ink a little bit when wet.

B00BXUG0KU|3.0|Thought there'd be more of a Latin feel to it.  Arrangements rather repetitive and dull. Good musianship, but Elias's voice is unemotional.  Missed the charm of the Chet Baker originals.

B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I first heard the song Pomepeii while driving through Charlotte, NC. It was on an alternative radio station, which, unfortunately, we don't have where I live. I wrote down the song name and came home and downloaded the CD. I am astounded at this huge sound that is nothing like anything I've ever heard. This is a band worth listening to, not only for their unique sound, but for the beautiful and meaningful words they write. Why are they not better known in the US? I'm spreading the word! I'm a huge fan now, and have shared this with several other people who find them equally wonderful to listen to. I highly recommend this fantastic album!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Great game for kids just not a big fan of all of gamelofts in app purchases that make it necessary to beat a game. My little ponies was a big disappointment. After all time and energy put in my daughter can't go any further without purchasing a large amount of gems. Hopefully this game is different.

B00DQVST76|4.0|I watched this concert live and I have to say that it is not short of AMAZING!!! With the anticipation of waiting to buy it on DVD/BLURAY...I was very disappointed with the editing. :( Please understand that when people buy concert DVD/BLURAY we are expecting a concert point of view...not a over-produced music video!!!<br />Yes...editing and sound editing is needed to get the best video angles and a proper mix of stage sound and crowd noise but we still want to see a concert to make us feel like we are actually there watching from the arena seats...not like watching a over-produced version looking like a music video!!! There are TOO MANY video cut in and cut out and panning in and out...for example...\\"The Girlee Show\\" was a really good edit of a Madonna Concert!!! \\"The Drowned World Tour DVD\\" also a good edit of the concert even with the special video effects added to it...\\"The Confessions Tour DVD\\" also a good edit of a Madonna concert with all the extra special video effects that don't take away from the concert viewing experience!!! The editing on \\"MDNA TOUR\\" is OVERKILL!!! If Madonna plans to sell another concert DVD version of the MDNA TOUR concert that shows more of the concert and less video editing I WOULD TOTALLY BUY IT!!! PUT IT THIS WAY... bootleg versions of the concert look way better than this...BUT SINCE I AM A HARD CORE MADONNA FAN I BOUGHT IT REGARDLESS!!!! FIRE YOUR EDITOR OF THIS CONCERT MADONNA!!! THEY DIDN'T DO THE CONCERT JUSTICE WITH THIS DVD/BLURAY...

1623650003|5.0|Alex<br />Pierre LeMaitre; Frank Wynne (translator)<br />MacLehose/Quercus, Sep 3 2013, $24.95<br />[...]<br />ISBN: 9781623650001<br /><br />In Paris thirty year old Alex Prevost knows she has become a beautiful young woman yet has doubts about her looks as she never forgets her days as a stammering ugly teen.  She notices the fiftyish male seemingly following her, as she saw him in the Metro, the street and outside a shop; but assumes she is being inanely paranoid though her nervousness about him makes her stammer.<br /><br />Alex starts to walk home when a van pulls up next to her.  That same man grabs her hair but pulls off her wig so she he punches her in the stomach causing her to puke before flipping her into the van and driving away.  A witness walking his dog tells height deprived Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven what happened.  Though he prefers the case was not his as he still grieves the abduction-murder of his wife, Camille realizes he must ignore his feelings since his only experienced peer Morel is in Lyons and knows time is running out on the victim especially when no demands from the kidnapper surfaces.<br /><br />This is a terrific twisting thriller anchored by a dark description of Paris by how Camille sees the City of Lights.  With two fully developed supporting cops on the lead team, readers will appreciate this exciting French police procedural as the hero, who faces constant height deficient prejudice, believes the victim is already dead.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|I received the deluxe 4 CD & books set as a gift. The books are mostly all posed pictures of Bob, and pictures of recording tape boxes. The two CD's that have the alternate takes, etc. are pretty good, but they slipped two tracks from the third (Isle of Wright) into the second one for some unknown reason. The sparse writing in the album book put me to sleep. And... The forth CD is the original Self Portrait album (which any real Dylan fan already has). So... don't buy the CD's, Buy the MP3's of the two alternate takes and the Isle of Wright. You sure don't need those books unless you just have to have every picture that was ever taken of Bob.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I have a lot of people telling me what shows I should watch. Everybody's a critic. And everybody has a show they think is amazing. So I find myself trying a lot of shows at other people's suggestions. And I rarely like them. Game of Thrones is the exception, though. When I saw the first episode, I was hooked. So hooked that I watched all the available shows, bought and read all the books, and now I'M that annoying person who won't shut up about their favorite show. I tell everybody about it. So, here we go... OMG THIS SHOW IS SO AMAZING YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!<br /><br />You've been told.

0374214913|4.0|After working for a time as a web designer for a nouveau bagel shop funded by dot.com money, Clay was a victim of the economic slowdown in San Francisco. Desperate for a job, he goes into Mr. Penumbra's bookstore. After being asked about his favorite book, he is immediately set a test to retrieve a book using one of the rolling ladders in the narrow and high back shelves of the store. He is surprised but grateful when he is hired for the overnight shift of the 24-hour store. Clay finds that this is no ordinary store. While the front holds some traditional stock, the back of the store holds volumes and volumes of books that appear to be in some form of code. For the special group of customers that belong to the club, he not only retrieves their requested books, but is required to log each visit and visitor in detail. Clay's curiosity leads him to delve further and his technical skills lead him to a surprising solution that pulls him in to the underworld of this secret society. Using the skills of his friends, Clay goes on a mission to solve the biggest mystery of his life. I won't go into any further detail, but this book is part fantasy, part techie tale, this was a delightful and clever romp of a book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very nicely written, couldn't put it down, actually read all 3 of them in 5 days... book one is certainly the most entertaining. Like her style of writing....
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This story has potential but there are so many problems with the book that I kept getting pulled out of the narration. Sense of scale and time is wonky but forgiveable. What gets me is the constant typos and characters whose names change accidentally.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|So, the acting was fine but the movie left out so much of the book that it felt like a very rough, rushed skeleton of the story. They leave out two of my personal favorite parts (including the \\"gypsy\\") and I didn't like that it's told as a flashback. So disappointed! The ending was all wrong... I'm not sure how it compares to the older versions, but rent this with caution and certainly don't buy it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the very book that will revive my belief in the Kindle self-publishing model...<br /><br />I should know; I've published such 'classics' as, [[ASIN:B008RLGURQ Summer Bucket List Ideas]] and [[ASIN:B00A0C9YM8 Were Crackers Making Me Fat? How A Paleo Diet Is Changing My Life...! (Paleo diet for beginners)]].<br /><br />You see, the Kindle market has become flooded with much crap over the years, so it's refreshing to see somebody with actual literary talent publishing to this platform. From start to finish I found myself hoping that the pages would run on forever, just so I could see who Hugh would unexpectedly kill off next (spoiler alert: People die in this tome).<br /><br />If you can't find something to like about this book, then you SUCK as a reader!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Perfectly done first season of an exceptional show. Think of this as the origin story of a superhero, where the superhero is the show!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|A very inspiring read! A young boy from Malawi dreams of improving his family's living conditions and ends up going much further than he ever imagined.
1250029465|5.0|This is an easy read. Glad James Bowen wrote this book for us to learn about the tough street life.<br />Enjoy every word of this book. It was hard to put the book down for daily chores.<br />James Bowen and Bob are very lucky finding each other. Hope both of them have a much better life since this book's publication.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written, decent suspense.  How does this happen in a nice family?  Read to find out...<br /><br />Definitely worth a recommend.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|At the absolute base:<br />  I do not like Christmas music. Or at least not 99% of it. There are some exceptions, but very few. Pentatonix (PTX) is one of the very few. A 5-person A Capella group who sound as big as most bands and fully-produced single artists. These five inspire joy and fun in every song that they do. Listening to the range of notes they can accomplish (especially the Bass, Avi) just brings chills and lets me enjoy even their Christmas-themed music any time of year.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was very engaging.  I now will read more by Gaiman and see if his other books are a good.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really like it. The only thing is not being able to play your own music and not being able to save your playlist on youtube.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|John McClane is back.  Well, actually, a 2 dimensional version of him is, somehow devoid of any of those appealing characteristics of humanity and \\"guy-next-door-ness\\".  This time, we are led to believe he has a son we have not yet heard about, whom he travels to Moscow to find and restore the family connection he lost some time ago.  His son has taken a career path that astonishingly his pop was unaware of, and McClane Senior and McClane Junior soon bond through killing umpteen anonymous bad guys, plus causing untold injuries and deaths in the populace around them.  To be fair, there are some breathtaking scenes in the car chase through Moscow, with an incredible amount of mayhem, smashing cars and explosions.. which is, let's be truthful, part of why we watch a movie with `Die Hard' in the title.  It's exciting, even though the camera tends to shake around so much you often have just a sense that something exciting is happening, while not being fully aware of what it actually is.  But the buzz isn't sustainable, and as the impressive stuntwork gives way to cgi McClanes flying through the air in the latter half of the movie, our brains are simply unable to hold that disbelief in suspension any more and the movie becomes at best a partial snoozefest.  The latter half of the movie suffers also from the absence of Moscow, which turns out to be quite an inspired choice for a movie like this, which gets replaced with somewhere suitably abandoned and lacking in energy (no pun intended, in case you know the story already).  This might have held together if there was a suitably charismatic villain.. but there isn't one.  The US taking sides with one half of a Moscow oligarch feud seems unlikely and  neither of the the two seem.. well, interesting.  Oh and did I forget to mention Jai Courtney plays McClane's son?  Mmmhh - probably because my brain is already forgetting about it.  Not so much because of the performance, just that the script never really lets him come into his own.<br />Maybe I am being a bit harsh.. after all, this is quite a routine and acceptable action flick.  But the thing is, I loved Die Hard.  I maybe wasn't quite sure why at the time, but unfortunately I have movies such as this to clarify it to me. Die Hard allowed our action heroes to be more human and vulnerable while still delivering thrills and action.  The action was precise and thrilling not because it was unbelievable, but because we were amazed to find it happening to this guy we accepted as belonging in the real world.  With this movie, we are firmly back into the 80's territory we were rescued from in the first place, of supermen we can't believe in and abundant action that loses its thrill pretty quickly.  How sad.
144233620X|5.0|This would not normally be the type of book I would pick up and read. My wife read it and recommended I read it as well since my father suffers from dementia. I listened to the audio version of the book, read by the author. The best thing about this book is its moving portrayal of Alice, a victim of early onset Alzheimer's disease. The entire book is written from her perspective and serves as a needed reminder for those of us with loved ones who suffer from dementia that the victim is still deserving of respect as a person. Highly recommended for those with friends or family members afflicted with this disease.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This works so Easy.  I was able set the alarm the first time I tried which members happens.  I am so glad I got this.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|...These remasters are light years above and beyond ALL previous versions -- and that includes the original London Calling I bought on vinyl in 1980 when I was 13 years old.  Like others have noted, these remasters are indeed louder.  However, in punk that is generally a good thing.  Also, the loudness does not come at the expense of dynamic range; Quiet passages are still quiet.  But, back to the loudness:  When I first listened to these remasters on my computer as I was ripping them to my hard drive, my jaw just kept dropping...Bass lines like on Rudy Can't Fail, always solid, are now downright SEISMIC.  Drums now sound like DRUMS, and not like Topper beating on a cardboard box.  Joe and Mick are now clearly identifiable as two separate voices with their own timbre, especially on Lost In The Supermarket.  The Guns of Brixton actually shook stuff loose on a bookshelf -- in my upstairs bedroom.  Again, this is just on a computer audio system.  I haven't even fired up the he-man rig in my living room yet.
141694740X|5.0|This book was better than I expected. Way better. It was honest, blunt, and hilarious. It was a perfect way to get any woman's head out of her butt and tackle the dating world by never forgetting how to be fabulous.
B000IZ4R1U|3.0|Of course Angelina is beautiful in this movie, but except for a few chuckles here and there, it gets really boring. I nodded off a few times and had to keep backing it up.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to have all my books on one app.  Great and easy to use plus convenient access on all my devices.
B0030B621W|4.0|I was craving some sci-fi, and would be willing to settle for an awful movie to get it.  I pre-judged this one by its cover and was pleasantly surprised.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|It was a good book.  Would love for his books to be longer.  I get lost in them, they're that good
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is a Great season of The Big Bang Theory.  I will watch it over and over again.  Thank you
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Never thought I'd play a piano, but love the idea. Great practice before I hit my wifes keyboard. Not so embarrassing!
B002ZG993Q|3.0|why do they even have stars to rate things if they make me type all this crap anyhow. this sucks
B000HKYN74|5.0|This is such a great show. Along the lines of trek-lore. very respectful of all trek series, yet stands on it's own. Very interesting and intelligent, challenges typical sci-fi storylines. In a day when television has totally lost it's ability to write original stories, we know we can always count on Star Trek for great stories. Would love to own the DVDs but still too expensive. Highly recommend.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This is a Great season of The Big Bang Theory.  I will watch it over and over again.  Thank you
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|If you liked season 1, you'll have to get season 2!! It delves deeper into the founding partners' relationship as well as the newb's upstart career.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie..  We are dog lovers and this movie is such a good story.  Too many people don't give dogs credit for their intuitiveness..  They are so amazing and love unconditionally...  If you are a dog lover, this is a must see...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I couldn't stop after the sample.  Some books with multiple characters and stories get you cross-eyed, not this one.  It's like running into an old friend you lost touch with and she just couldn't wait to get you up to speed on what you missed in 10 years.  You're not sure how, but all the little stories come together and you understand, and it's like you never left.<br /><br />In the end, you don't get that warm, fuzzy feeling of a happy ending but as you walk away - not sad, just thoughtful, you promise to stay in touch.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This is a Great season of The Big Bang Theory.  I will watch it over and over again.  Thank you
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Well done movie with complex characters. and a unique setting.  A boy fighting to believe in love risking it all to help someone he barely knows.  Well worth watching.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Once again Cruise delivers great acting, for those who love Sci-Fi they will like this. Not a big fan but still was entertaining.
B00CIVLX2S|5.0|A compulsive foodie and collector of recipe books, this was really my first \\"close encounter\\" with Gordon Ramsay. A compelling read and chock full of imaginative yet uncomplicated recipes with readily available ingredients. I am keen to try all - there was not one that I felt I'd give a miss.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show, because not only is there a thrilling murder mystery in every episode, but Castle is just so cute and funny that I just can't get enough of these guys!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Being a Magician, I may be a bit biased. But, I thought this movie was very well done, and quite entertaining.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This is a self-awareness book, not a stereotypical self-help book. If you are seeking peace, calm, tranquility and happiness in your life, you may be surprised to learn where to find it - within yourself - and how to find it - by stopping identifying with your thoughts and emotions. This is the core message of the book, and it's very simple and within reach for anyone willing to pause, take a step back and consider who they really are. It is also a message that is not exclusive to Tolle at all, you can find the same wisdom in many places, books, spiritual practices, and yes even religion. I found Tolle's explanations and guided narrative very practical and suited for modern times, nothing cryptic or mysterious about it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderfully well done story about a period in history of great social change.  It does an excellent job identifying the change in a woman's place in society and reminds about where we were such a short time ago. The acting is great and makes the story so real without getting boring.
B00A9ET4SG|5.0|Chimamanda writes Nigeria and race politics brilliantly in this novel. Says things that people think but don't often say with wit, brilliance and wonderful writing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game I say is 5 stars,for anyone who enjoyed the movies should like this game.You actually really don`t need internet for this game.The only thing you really need internet for is the updates.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|I never watched this movie so I can make no review at the present time. I don't remember ordering it either for that matter.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I would recommend this season to anyone who enjoys English history.  I enjoy the story between the lines of history about which we already know.  The lead actor as king does a great job filling a role that so many have played before him and still making the story interesting.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Once you start watching Season 1, you will be hooked! This series is great. Counting down the days for Season 4.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game Is great but need too fix the realms and need too fix Redstone I can't take even with a iron pick but and it needs some more things but it's pretty cool and the same as the pc.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|After completion of this book I find myself ashamed of how little I knew of the horrors going on in North Korea. An eye opener. A must read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book.  Complicated plot that hangs together for entire book.  Well written, I'll be back for the second segment soon.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|I love this Woody Allen DVD. I have watched it twice. It is filled with great scenes from his movies
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This app is exactly what it says it is, a post-it note for your kindle.  The only thing they could make better is having little sticky notes that stay on your screen for reminders.

B00CTSDDVO|3.0|I recommend you rent this movie and do not buy it.  The movie is OK but not one I will watch again for a long time.  I did not see it until it came out on Blu-ray 3D.  I don't think it was one of the better Star Trek movies.  The special features are OK but not great.  The 3D was very good in spots but overall not something that jumps out at you.
B00B9366VO|5.0|A great in depth story of Sound City. Lots of different bands recorded there. I just wish they'd included the fate of the recording studio. I read somewhere else that Dave Grohl bought the board when the studio closed. Would have liked to hear more about the actual closing.

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Can not wait until Nov. 26th to get my hands on this awesome set, got in on amazon.ca pre ordered for $118.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|it was long, long and boring and depressing.  too boot the movie kept stopping and restarting and stopping and restarting, so annoying that sometimes amazon movies do this to us.  really disappointed in the movie, I can see why it didn't make it in the theatre.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This is a great movie but it is for sure not for young children. It does have some language it and violence but the movie is good. I love the girl in the movie and I also enjoyed watching Kick Ass 2. I recommend this movie for teenagers and young adults.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|it was just what i ordered and at a very good price and got to me very fast thanks so much A++++
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the development of the characters.  The shallowness of the upper crust is amazing to watch, but it is nicely balanced with the myriad of 'real world' problems that they confront. The servants' attempts at being mirror images of their masters (what a stupid word!) demonstrates the universal difficulties that humans must resolve - wealthy or not.<br /> I like the character of Cora (Countess Crawley / mirror is Mrs. Hughes) - she is a voice of reason and common sense. The episode where Sybil goes into labor was particularly difficult to watch, where Robert Crawley's reliance and habit of deferring to status actually  results in his daughter's death.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I would give 20 stars if I could! I downloaded these books ages and ages ago. When I would be looking for something to read I would skip past these books on my Kindle and think \\"Nah, not right now\\".<br />What was I freaking thinking!!!! I started reading these last night and read all 3 back to back - hence my eyeballs feel like they are about to drop out of my sockets I am that tired.<br />I am not a fan of Slam poetry. But you get a huge sense of emotions when you read the poetry in these books. I really enjoyed Lake's first version in the classroom. That was a hoot!<br />What can I say but WILL COOPER!!! I am in BB heaven. What a total predicament that Will & Lake met through (by the way I love Lake's name, so original).<br />I was sucked into these stories right from the start and I just couldn't put them down. I do believe in soul mates and destiny or fate and I believe that Will & Lake had that in spades with their instant connection. And their brothers were hilarious. I loved the emotional turmoil that was going on with Will & Lake's need to be distant. I could see the growth that occurred from their tragedies.  This is a couple that had to deal with real life moments and issues that even an older adult would struggle with. But together they mesh really well and are the ying and the yang.<br />Overall I thought these were great stories and they are ones that I know that I will read again. So worth the read so start now! Thanks again Colleen.
B000002J1O|5.0|Beautiful music, satirical words.  Can be listened to over and over again - without getting tired of it.  It's great to have the option via Amazon of purchasing hard-to-find music from the past.

6302516919|4.0|Story of Arnold Cunningham who buys a beat-up 1958 Plymouth Fury from a creepy guy with a story.

B009I2UH2W|5.0|This product works as described.  My boss needed a replacement and this was a perfect match.  The price was reasonable.
B00A285OOW|3.0|This novel put an interesting spin on the mystery of the boys in the tower, the forever missing York princes.  Did one survive and return as a young man?  We're they murdered by King Richard?  Though King Henry is depicted as a weak king in this book, he actually enacted a great many laws and innovations that made the crown very rich by the time Henry VIiii took the throne.  Though not beloved, he was known for his intellect and ability to govern his country.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love watching the saga continue. Fun to see how story lines work out. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00136Q342|5.0|This album and &#34;At San Quentin&#34; are two of Cash's most famous albums, and there is a reason for this. They are both absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />This album has incredible atmosphere, and one has to hear it for themselves to truly understand. The songs can go from gritty and dark to energetic and exciting in an instant. A must have for anybody. Period.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I've had this series on VHS for many years and was so excited to switch to DVD.  Well worst the money.  Soooooo funny!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I have liked Star Trek when they were on TV the first time.  They just keep getting better and better.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Perhaps my take on this is somewhat different but I found Piper Kerman's series of stories about life in a minimum security prison to be sad; not because of the women she encounters, but how throughout she manages to both set herself above them and then also remind us that she likes them all despite their ethnic and socio-economic differences. It's disingenuous to suggest her life, grounded in family, friends and money, is anything like the people with whom she interacts or that they will have her prospects at normalcy when they leave. But instead of addressing the broad social facets that led to their incarceration and then interplaying them against her own, she turns these women into caricatures; often it's sentimental, to be sure, but it's still degrading. And then there is the notion of selling these stories to TV to be recreated as an enjoyable-yet-nonsensical show, which further degrades the life they lead and the troublesome societal schisms that led them there. I went into this with trepidation because I'm a man and thought I wouldn't relate; but that wasn't the problem. It's just not very nice to believe you're this superior to others when all you have is more money.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Not often do you find an album that you enjoy all the some songs on it. But, Blake knocked it out of the park with &#34;Based on a True Story..
B001DPHDCY|5.0|this is a great movie. I am a jim carrey and steve carrel fan and they do well in this movie. animation is spectacular. it is a nice clean storyline. lots of goofiness. very small portion of the movie is song and dance.
0062238868|3.0|I read Kyle's book after reading both of Marcus Luttrell's books, &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and &#34;Service&#34;.  Not the same quality as them I'm afraid.  As a trained sniper I enjoyed some of the technical explanations in American Sniper and some of the DA (door kicking) stories.  Kyle is definitely the consummate warrior and displays that &#34;warrior ethos&#34; Steven Pressman describes(another great read) as do most SF/SPECOPS operators, but it just wasn't the same read as Luttrell's.  The dedication of these professionals is almost incomprehensible to those not in that community but is obvious in this book and the others already mentioned.  What a shame Chris Kyle's life came to such an abrupt and unexpected end.  Dedicated to his fellow warriors to the end!!!  Kaya's comments were interesting and gave an honest insight into the family life these men have/don't have.  The nation owes Kyle and those like him &#34;Damned few&#34; (to quote An Act of Valor) a tremendous debt of gratitude.  One of the best stories is Kyle's thumping Jesse Ventura in a bar (he referred to him in the book as &#34;Fuzzy&#34;) because the former was running his mouth for a change.  Ventura denies it and is suing Kyle's estate for defamation.  Class act Governor!  You'll like this book, especially at this price.
B0086700CM|4.0|Love trying to outwit the chasers. Despite either being caught or having an accident trying to escape, it can be addictive trying again. It's a little discouraging when the game doesn't respond to actions like turning corners, ducking or jumping.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I liked the movie. I received the movie on time. The movie remind me of the 80's. It was Great.

B003H4I4JU|2.0|OMG, couldn't get past the first 50 pages.  I realize he wrote this or at least started writing it before Ender's Game; that being said it's hard to follow and get in to.  I liked Ender's Game so much I thought this would be a winner for sure.  Sucks.

B005TVYVI2|5.0|My stroke rate was 48/min, whereas coaches recommend 60/min and wasting less time gliding.  I bought this, and just having the beep every second to keep up a faster stroke sped me up considerably.  It's simple, but it works.  The battery compartment is insulated by an O-ring from water, and separated again from the elctronics by more insulation to make it a double-wall against water.  Had no problems with it in the water.

B00CXS55LG|5.0|For those of you who have heard the hype, forget it, and judge for yourself.<br />For those of you who have not, I envy you. You can approach this objectively.<br /><br />In any event, this album is worth a listen. The musicians in Deafheaven create an epic and atmospheric album of heavy music. Somehow, they took the tremolo picking, blast beats, and shrieks of black metal and transformed them into an ethereal, open sound. The vastness pulls you in, and for an hour, you live in their world. And their world refreshes lovers of heavy music with its originality and homage to heavy music traditions.<br /><br />If you aren't sure about it, you can find the band's music on YouTube to see if you may dig the sound. I had this album on repeat throughout July 2013, and I constantly return to it. Whether I want to relax or have music in the background while study, I can play this. Sometimes works are just perfect for what they are; this is one of them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a little slow in the beginning until I could connect all the people and who they were. But towards the end I couldn't put it down until I found out who the killer was. The end was a shocker. And it was interesting how the author turned things around telling about what could have happened.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Really fun for a while. My kindle fire HD crashes at level 31 so I cannot reach the end. Fun

B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have enjoyed 2 seasons of Downton Abbey.  It is a great story line and family friendly.  We don't have to turn it off or ask the kids to leave the room to watch the entire series.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Plausible situations make this a good twist, a little disturbing, but good.  The acting is pretty good...liked Jude Law in this.
B00947N6D8|5.0|The artistic presentation of this show is beautiful and often stunning.  The story is interesting and really facinates the children watching it.  It is not too bad for their parents either.  I recomend this movie very highly.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I've played this game for a year and I still love the challenge of beating high scores. Good time passer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read - I loved how you could root for and hate the main characters at the same time.  Wasn't sure how it was going to end, and I think the author did it perfectly.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It was a good movie of different pregnancy situations. It was nice to see the adoption portion for those who can't conceive.
B005544TRQ|5.0|this is a great series!  There are well-rounded characters that they show &#34;warts & all&#34;.  I choose to watch this to entertain myself while walking on the treadmill.  It was a great choice, just wish they were a full hour.  I usually end up watching one, getting off and starting the next to finish up. Be careful it's like potato chips, you can's stop at just one.
B007IWG3WC|4.0|It was about what I was expecting.  Pretty good movie with all the excitement you'll need.  Special effects I thought were &#34;special&#34;.

B0031RAOVY|4.0|This a very inspirational movie about loyalty.. Even though it dealt with a dog and a family that took him in, this movie showed me how much we are to stay true to others that are in our lives...
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|Everyone knows about this Multi platinum CD that put Fleetwood Mac on the map.  Is this the definive version of the album you want?  It's your person taste how much you want to dig in for the journey.  I was happy to remember the original song cycle without bonus tracks.  Remaster version here is of acceptable sound quality but not audiophile standard.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|We did an instant download of this movie and liked enough to order a DVD copy. All the characters are well drawn and Maggie stands out as usual. Plus you get all the wonderful music. Almost perfect. I think we will enjoy it many more times to come.

B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I love this game it's a lot of fun and I enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed the movie.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Great remaster of the original sixties concept album.  if you love the vocal era Bee Gees over the Disco era Bee Gees you must have this CD.  However, if disco is your thing you can skip this Red Velvet wonder.  Red Velvet ? Come feel the noise- textured album cover it was a sixties thing.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|better interaction of real and animation, the  action is off the chain as tony and pepper get more involved as a team. has to be one of top 5 in  2 yrs for action/sifi movie.the bonus features was a nice addition.

1936608898|5.0|My wife and I are in the last week of the 30 initial detox.  Actually, we started around August first, but we were getting some amazing results.<br /><br />I was dragged kicking and screaming to do this.  My wife did every right and I was doing everything wrong.<br /><br />1st 10 days.  Everything tasted horrible.  Because my body was going through detox of gluten, pasta, sugar, milk and soda, I was lethargic and slept most of the day for most of the first 10 days, then Shazam!  Day 11 I woke up full of energy @ 7:30 am.  In 10 years with living with MS made a believer out of me.  I also didn't have brain fog.  I felt great, I cleaned the bathroom, did laundry, including folding.<br /><br />The biggest mistake I made was to let my wife read the book.  10 days into this diet, we started to read the book together.  Everyone in your house should help reading this book to each other.  I was scared into loving this plan.  Then several MS symptoms began to disappear.  I had energy!  Aches and pains vanished.  No brain fog!  Unfortunately I still suffer from spasticity.  In the book they have people suffering with MS getting relieve of their symptoms.<br /><br />Additional Information, 11 Nov 2013:  After two and a half months, I'm proving this diet.  Folks with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) usually live in a \\"funk\\".  On my best day, I feel a little \\"spacey\\".  Some MSrs have tried to explain the experience as Brain Fog or akin to having a cold.  Whatever.  I know now that what others have written is true.  I've lost over 15 lbs, and have more energy and I feel REAL GOOD!  At least read the book.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|The Who were at their best during this period. Yes Hull is better then Leeds set but the remote tape machine had problems so The Who released Leeds over Hull.  Enter 21 century technology fix the Hull set with dubs from the Leeds set result you get the idea of the pacing of the Hull set.  However it's no substitute Leeds rules because its the original.  Fact of life all live albums have fixes, edits, etc to make them sound better.  Hull is just more obvious because you can not help compare with Leeds.  Bottom line on a desert island and you can only take one CD - Ill grab Leeds over Hull.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I started my Christmas shopping, and this is a great deal!!  Would recommend to all. My daughter will be thrilled!!!

B00BHWG5C2|4.0|I'm hearing this for the first time. I'm not a big fan of the Stones. I don't know their catalog upside down and inside out like I know The Who or The Beatles, But I'm really enjoying this fantastic live performance from Mick, Keith and the boys. I recommend this, although I was fortunate to buy it used for about 14 usd. I agree that this release could have been just as gratifying if the unreleased Stones tracks were added to the disc that features the original album. Also, omitting the third disc which features live performances of Ike & Tina Turner and BB King (who I assume were on this tour with the Stones) would have made this better. Not that Ike & Tina or BB King aren't worthy of a listen. They just don't belong on an album called \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out - The Rolling Stones In Concert\\". Honestly, I would not have bought this if I had to pay more than $20. I guess it's cool that there's a DVD in this too, however, it's not as if they gave you a video version of the album.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!! It is such a neat idea and it is sooooooo helpful in my math class! I'm in honors math so i need to check my answer and this is perfect!! Even my math TEACHER has this app!!!!!!!!!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great track - great version! I listened to the others and chose this one. High quality sound. Lyrics are exact.
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|Despite the awful fart and drug humor, some parts in this movie still make my craugh (cry-laugh). It has a silliness reminiscent of Zucker-Abrams. It's more Naked Gun than Airplane. It's not really as good as either of those, call it a distant cousin comedy, but it's still worth a watch.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book.I loved it! What as great storyteller, i finished it in 2 days and am buying another of her books!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Chris Eccleston and Billie Piper are magic together.  Rose Tyler was one of my favorite companions of all time...get it, 'all time'.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This movie was built up too much.  Made you believe it was more about robbing banks and stuff in previews.  Once you realized it was more than what they made it into it was better.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Even my five and three year olds still loved it. It's got it all for a great family movie night experience.
1612191290|5.0|This might be the most important book you read this decade. Graeber ask what the phrase \\"You have to pay your debts\\" really means, and his answer involves a looping historical, anthropological, linguistic, and philosophical in the nature of currency, coinage, and capitalism.<br /><br />As Graeber notes, the standard economic story of the development of coinage: that bartering diverse good (potatoes for shoes for sheep for shovels) was so inconvenient that people developed cash to be more efficient, has no evidence of support. Rather, indigenous societies tend to work on principles of mutual solidarity within the group. Everybody is bound together in a complex web of minor debts and obligations, the cancellation of which is the same as the end of the relationship. Currency in these 'human economies' is used to arrange marriages and compensate for murders. Their purpose is not that human beings can be bought, but precisely to point out how unique each human life is.<br /><br />On top of this primordial communism, Graeber recognizes two harmful phenomenon. Debt peonage, caused by ever escalating interest on loans, reduces free citizens to slaves, prompting rebelling and escape from urban agricultural centers. Coinage, precious metal currency, is wealth stripped of all its context, anonymous money for strangers of little trust. Together, they lead to what Graeber describes as the 'military-slavery-coinage complex', the use of force to seize human beings, rip them away from their homes, set them to working mines and plantations, and turn the money into coins to pay the army to continue the war. Combine the two, and you get the most rapacious form of modern capitalism: debt-laden soldiers trying to reduce everything around them to hard currency as fast as they can.<br /><br />The philosophical and linguistic sections are if anything, better than the history and the anthropology. Almost all of our modern philosophies originate in questions about what money measures, what the universe is made of, and the paradox of ethical action and self-interest.<br /><br />Graeber's arguments are more complex than what I've presented here. I'm sure that there are other interpretations to the history he has chosen. But he's asking The Big Questions, and one that cuts at the heart of our current crisis of faith.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|There was no story line and all there was was killing and yes more killing. I would have like to see more in the way of a story.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|A great classic movie that everyone should own! The hummer in this movie carries on through time, it could never be out of date!!!
B002XBVQKW|3.0|Steve Martin is really funny in his role as the Sadistic Dentist. And when Bill Murray makes his appearance in the movie it's one of the funniest moments in almost any movie that I've seen. However, after Steve Martin is killed off the movie is done for me. I don't know what it is, but it can't hold my attention to make it to the end.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Along with the normal action of a front lines war movie this movie also takes into account what is going on back home in the states with the families of those men fighting overseas.  A classic movie.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Characters are endearing and lovable. Setting is beautiful. Definitely a chick flick but one that doesn't fill your head with useless dreams of perfect romance but honest love.

B00B52F278|3.0|The Spartacus saga comes to an end with WAR OF THE DAMNED. Although it is called the third season of SPARTACUS, there were four seasons including the prequel.<br /><br />Spartacus and his warriors are now free and moving about the countryside. The bloody battles continue and the former slaves attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. In War of the Damned, the ex-slaves have become as brutal as their former masters. When they overtake a Roman city, no mercy is shown to the Roman citizens. Only the slaves in the city have a chance. The brutality of this season seems to overshadow everything else. The hatred and need for revenge are so strong.<br /><br />SPARTACUS has been a remarkable series. It's visual effects and authentic costumes and sets have been like no other. All the limits on violence and sex have been pushed to the extreme, but now it seems like it is time for Spartacus to end. The bloodletting is no longer so shocking and the sex has been toned down. Most of the actresses still get to do full frontals but the extremes, especially from Season one, have ended.<br /><br />The series seems to be lost as the warriors meander across the Roman empire. The gladiators are gone. Many of the characters from past seasons who added such spice to the show are gone. The show is hanging together by threads. It's just one battle after another followed by one betrayal after another.<br /><br />The show wraps ups the saga the best it can. Some of our heroes survive, others don't. It finally comes to an end and the glory of Rome is left to fate.<br /><br />The end has come and the show's creativity has been exhausted. There would be no need for another season. This set had a few extras that were rather dull and lifeless..more of the wonders of the special effects and the physical hardships of the actors. My big disappointment is the fact that there was no tribute to the original Spartacus Andy Whitfield, who died in 2011. It was his illness that led the producers to do a prequel so Whitfield could be treated and return as Spartacus. Sadly, Whitfield never recovered. Although he is mentioned briefly in the history of the series, he deserved a tribute and more of a mention in the extras on this DVD set.<br /><br />No one can deny that SPARTACUS was a remarkable achievement in TV history. The quality of the actors, costumes, visual effects and sets rival anything seen on the big screen. This was an incredible series that lost its fizz in the final season. Goodbye, Spartacus and friends. You took us on a sensational journey.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it is amazing!Do not listean to the other reveiws about the nasty adds ive played for a long time and ive seen none.

B00AHHODH2|5.0|Although a short story and I generally don't like short stories, it was very well written and kept my interest going from beginning to end. The characters were all so different and the story had so many twists and turns one wondered if it could ever end well. It did but it also kept you wanting more. Hopefully Mr. Whitehead will write more about the &#34;. . . CLUB&#34;. I for one will be the first in line to purchase it.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I grew up watching the original in the late 70’s and loved it, and to me this is the best version of both. If you haven’t seen this one but have experienced the original, then you owe it to yourself to check it out and you are in for a treat. Is a far more absorbing story than the original in every way. I had bought all the seasons of this new alternate version separately on DVD so I can give firsthand experience on both formats and this boxed set.<br />Pros; The clarity of picture and sound of Blu-ray (BD) High Definition goes without saying. It also includes the movie ‘The Plan’ which is a nice addition to the set (not included in the DVD format versions within the individual seasons).<br />Cons; If you have this series on DVD and an LCD screen with an HDMI cable connection and a good home theatre sound system, then just stick with it and save your money. The picture and sound are about as good with this set up so you don't need to go for the extra mile to enjoy it.<br />There are grainy scenes every so often in all the episodes (which I understand where deliberate to give it a more ‘gritty’ feel to the overall aspect of the story), and those are equally transferred to the BD version.<br />The packaging is nice and is set up as seasons 1 thru 4 with a book type case holding each set of disks for every season, with the movie 'The Plan' on a BD case by itself. Aside for a few extra details which are standard on most BD discs (navigation options, opening commentaries, etc), and the inclusion of the movie ‘The Plan’, there isn’t any difference with the episodes, added interviews, commentaries, and deleted scenes which are the same as in the DVD version. If the set had included the movie ‘Blood & Chrome’ and the Cylon figurine from the original special edition set, it truly would be the definite BSG series collectible. In short, if you don’t have this series and can find it on BD at a decent price, I highly recommend it, hence my rating of 5 stars.. If you have it on DVD you can find ‘The Plan’ and ‘Blood & Chrome’ (either pre-owned or at a discount at many online and movie stores) and add them to your set and then your collection will be complete.VD you can find ‘The Plan’ and ‘Blood & Chrome’ (either pre-owned or at a discount at many online and movie stores) and add them to your set and then your collection will be complete.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It very similar to bejeweled n very easy to play but I don't  like the fact that it hounds u to play on fb with. Sometimeswe would like to play amongst ourselves.
B000TYWAUA|4.0|It was a good movie, not a great one.  Mostly I bought this movie because of Amazons discounts, if I watch this movie 3+ times then it would become more economical than just renting.  Great graphics, OK plot. You can put this in the same category as clash of the titans and immortals, but behind troy and far behind gladiator, if your into these ancient epilogues. If not for a discounted price, I would not have bought.
B003L7DK74|2.0|The second disc of season one was scratched making 2 episodes impossible to watch I was not satisfied with the purchase

B0074QGGK6|4.0|Actually applies to most jobs and a lot of other things you could be doing with your life. You should read it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars all around. It's filled with information and details that are so imaginative! But what is really amazing are the stories lines and characters. The book is a compilation of many characters and their tales of the war, it would've been easy to lose that connection the reader has with characters but this author did amazing! You feel what's happening every step of the way. LOVE IT!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Awesome very addicting would recommend it to everyone! Graphics are awesome and haven't had any problems playing.<br /> love it!! Can't wait to get  the next one!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I had my doubts when I saw this movie and my family wanting to rent it. It was really good. The story line was a little blah but the action kept you interested. Definitely a movie to add to my collection.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Love it! Awesome songs! Awesome beats! And seeing it live was even better sounding :) So glad they got back together w Kevin :)
B003ZMF26W|5.0|The individual I purchased this for loves it but finds it a little sensitive at first.  Otherwise cheaper here then the manufactures.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Halfway decent game in the vein of many Facebook games. I don't like the dependence on energy and they try really hard to get you to spend real money, but certainly a decent time killer.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it!! Though it may not be 100% accurate portrayal (what movie ever is?) of the legal and health care system, I believe The Rainmaker depicts the many flaws within our insurance system and how it needs to change. Adding to its greatness is the characters and performances. The characters are captivating and the acting is superb!! I dare call this Matt Damon's greatest role and recommend this movie to anyone.
B000HL09MG|5.0|Even though it's not reputedly [entirely] Kubrick due to his unfortunate and untimely passing, it's nevertheless heavenly to get my [final] Kubrick fix.  Oddly, it does seem fitting for his final work.  Additionally, it's sadly based on a most unfortunate and sick reality in this current incarnation.
0061353248|5.0|An enchantingly fun read, and cleverly written explanation of how our subconscious and senses can deceive us.  If you think you know why you make choices, I challenge you to read this book and discover the truth!
B005LB1MY6|5.0|I particularily liked this album quite alot.<br /><br />playing out with Justice's use of more guitar and a electric-rock like stance.<br /><br />most of the tracks are groovy to my ears and i love listening to them while driving my car.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|An excellent sequel.  Picks up where book 3 left off, occurs at the same time as book 4.  I highly recommend it.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Very informative. Makes you stop and think Good read for all couples. Totally makes alot of sense and easy to follow her suggestions
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I am in my late 50's and loved this movie. There was so much I could relate to either personally or a friend/family member--losing a spouse, lack of income, facing old age alone.  Great movie!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Esse jogo e muito bom jaxzijczjcsnkz much more. The only the first time since the last time since I've seen in the world is not responsible to be the world is a FAB the last time I have been the world Tutsis Yuri and a FAB the first to rat
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you like Magic the gathering you'll like this app, it works great on my galaxy S3 despite not being designed for phones
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I had a general idea of the misery of North Koreans but this book made it crystal clear.  Fascinating, appalling, frustrating and yet hopeful, the book makes you think and somehow want to help a real revolution take place, even from afar.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|In this movie you saw Mr. Clooney's acting more than just his pretty face. Great story, wish the language was a little more toned down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well done. Final chapter of the series was an excellent ending. Enjoyed all 3  books. I hope Susan Collins does more.
0525425772|5.0|My 11 yr old son loves this series! He is not an avid reader but these grabbed his interest and he kept asking for the next .
B008602KQI|5.0|As with any movie, it doesn't really follow the book, but it was a very good movie over all.  I would recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Overall I was not impressed with this movie. I didn't need to see J.J Abrams version of Wrath of Kahn. If your going to reboot the franchise I'd like something new, not a rehashing of the greatest Trek movie of all time. It's not a horrible movie, just nowhere near as good as the frist or the org. W.O.K
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Although Mr. Bowen's writing skills are not poetic, he does tell a compelling story.  I very much enjoyed hearing about his recovery from a heroin addiction, and how the appearance of a highly intelligent and sympathetic feline aided with this.  A fun read, and solid example of how the internet can add to the enjoyment of such a tale.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Watched in movie theater enjoyed it so much had to buy it. Must say, after catching my breath from the first couple of minutes, naked woman with tore up Denzel, I was able to enjoy the movie. The movie is basically about a functioning drug addict who finally at the very end decides to deal with his demons and face the severe consequences of his choices. If you have ever watched a Denzel Washington movie you know you will get great acting from not only him but the entire cast. I would recommend this movie to anyone that not only enjoys watching one of the best actors in the world but a story that reminds people that you can sweep your problems under the rug but eventually you have to deal with them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read the trilogy twice!  I can't put it down after I get started.  An excellent read.  I love having the whole trilogy to read.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|ot all that special.  Happy with other mahjong games  It was not helpful when I tried to change levels and I deleted it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I can play it everywhere whenever  I want to. Totally worth the Buy. I hope they update it soon for multiplayer soon being able to play with your friends can keep the fan  more interesting for sure :)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this movie :) I am so sad they canceled firefly. This is a good wrap up, though there a few things I wish would have been brought back in.
B0045INOCO|5.0|Just as wonderful the 10th time as the first it is a classic I am sure that I will watch it many more times in my life
B004X80QNG|4.0|Useful app.  Nice graphics and easy to use.  Very satisfied with the various divisions.  Very pleased I got the app.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I like it very much, I am still learning how to use it.  What I have  tried with it has worked very well.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Amazing and exciting to watch for every episode, can never wait to watch the next one. A completely mind blowing experience.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I was feeling down and ordered this movie because a friend recommended it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's a cute, heartwarming little flick.  I will probably watch it again.
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|If you are a Paul Simon fan I believe you will enjoy this album. I sure did. It's absolutely wonderful and brings us right up to his latest album. I hope there will be more music from Paul Simon in contemporary concerts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It's erotic without being raunchy.  This is definitely one I would recommend to others to read.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|Best game in the world I love nyan cat and with this it takes it to the max I am deadlocked by.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Love this TV series! So sad that its only one season! Love the characters they all have such fun and different personalities!
B009CCBCU4|4.0|A ver nice read. A very pleasant surprise -I wasn't expecting that I would like it, but I did like it.
B00ET7ICEQ|2.0|Sheryl Crow has become a country girl since moving to Nashville a few years ago, so the title of this album can be taken literally. It's twelve songs that are more than a little a bit country. The singer, whose brand of pop rock never really fit snug in a particular subgroup, embraces her new world with open arms. The problem is that, genres aside, she isn't making good music anymore. The closest thing here is an Easy summer romancer that begins remarkably similar to Tom Petty's Free Falling. Other songs, like Waterproof Mascara and the bombastic Give It To Me, are molded with flat melodies and cornball lyrics.<br /><br />marcellee.com
1451696191|5.0|The book is amazing so far, I love the book it was shipped to me and I got it within I would like to say about 2-3 days, I was amazed that it was here that fast, and I love the book
B005CRQ2Y4|2.0|Didn't enjoy this book at all. I started it at the end of a vacation, and never was interested enough in the book to read it more, though I kept reading. I got so disinterested in the characters that I would skip over pages as she over described plays, and books.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was quite different from the other books written by Hosseini.  Much of the book takes place outside of Afghanistan.  This was disappointing for me, because I really enjoy the details of the country that contrast with the violence and under civilized images from news feeds.  I understand the switching of the narration from characters and generations as a whole, but it was fairly distracting and builds up an anticipation that is never fully realized.<br />I actually rate this as 3 1/2 stars, but I can't figure out the 1/2 star.  I will continue to seek out Hosseini's work.
B009JZSC9S|3.0|Love the content of law and family story line.<br /><br />Think it is very inappropriate in the sexuality shown. Too explicit.
013168728X|5.0|this book is asked by our school. I have just read the first three chapter and it is a good book,easy to understand.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Sounds good, clear, mellow...just like all previous AIC CD's.  Also got The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here...I could listen to Jerry's voice forever...RIP Layne and Mike...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|in this app you get great graphics and fun minions! there are many different settings such as el machos lair, Grus lab, residential area, and a beach!! get this app and leave it a good rating!!
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Avenged is back with another great album.  This work strays from their previous albums with a bit different sound, but it works for them and showcases their talent and abilities!
0345803485|5.0|Heard a lot about this series and was not disappointed.  A real page turner.  Started the second book right after finishing this one.
B00023B1A8|5.0|If you're into CSN (and not Y) like me, and into guitars and vocals then you will like. I mainly got it for the music but, when I play it when people are around I find them sitting and staring at the tube. These guys are truly legends in their own time.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is my new favorite movie!  I never read the book, but this movie was everything I could have hoped for.  It is visually magnificent with a well written story and narration.  This is a story told by an adult Pi, of his childhood in India and how he survived and persevered at sea with only a full-grown tiger for company.  The movie does have spiritual/religious undertones in it which are left open for personal interpretation.  There are some violent scenes, so I would recommend caution when allowing children to watch.  Not since Avatar has a movie been this visually appealing!  With the great storytelling and visuals, this is a movie to watch again and again!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I find this app very easy to use and I get the weather information I want when I want it.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Always entertaining the Good Wife delivers another exceptional season. This well casted drama is a network hit with a nicely woven script.
0736041850|4.0|The book was very helpful and had plenty of useful diagrams! I recommend purchasing this book for beginners who plan on strength training.
0345803493|5.0|This book kept me wanting to read more. After reading the first book I'm glad I had this one waiting to continue the story.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Decent movie, entertaining, cool FX but hard movie to follow. The movie throws out a lot of assumption and if you miss them you will get a little lost in all the cool stuff going on. My Family enjoyed this movie so that is why I give this movie a 3-Star Rating
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I love these adventure games. Somewhat a throwback of the old adventure games from the 80s ams 90s. I just love em.  Unfortunately, the themes of these games tend to be dark and related to some sort of satanism or black magic. Why some much dark?
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a really good book that is very sad  like Percy and crew gets in a full scale war with Kronos<br /> And the rest of the Titans this  was explained in full detail so it kind of reminded me of the hunger games with all the blood and gore<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS 10+
B00ET47USI|4.0|To compare this to other spider games wouldn't be fair to them.  This game is outstanding!  And such fun to observe
B00871C09S|5.0|Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, colorized.  Awesome movie set.  Have you ever thought your neighbor was up to no good but didn't know for sure?  What happens to Jimmy Stewart in this film is like a nightmare version of that.  Also it's very cool that he has window view versions of what several of his neighbors are up to at various times.  Also, I might mention that I love Hitchcock movies and particularly with Jimmy Stewart.  He was so folksy, normal, such an easy-going, likable fellow that when something strange and awful happens to him it is particularly horrible.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|6 good ways to survive the wait for season 4 of my little pony friendship is magic<br /><br />1. watch the show<br />if your the kind of brony who likes to watch my little pony over and over again, you can easily watch all 3 current seosons on netflix, or if you don't have netflix you can get a one month trial.<br />2. spend time with loved ones.<br />if you like other things too or if you have someone to play with ask them over to your house and spend quality time with them.<br />3. play games<br /> if your a gamer like me you can just sit down at your your pc or mac or any other game system and get wasted.<br />4. get some rest.<br />if you can't do any of those things just get some sleep, and dream about what you've seen in reason 1 watch the show.<br />5.

B009FB3XTA|5.0|great music. I loved this cd. It was so wonderful to listen to. I cant wait for another one to come out
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|fabulous, excellent, awesome, the best.  I have every Star Trek movie and this was, of course, a must have.  Scenes, drama, Chris Pine, cameo by Leonard Nimoy all great.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Seriously for a game this cheap its not bad at all. Don't do games like this too much but I like this one
B008NW67E0|5.0|great music. I loved this cd. It was so wonderful to listen to. I cant wait for another one to come out
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This movie is interesting to the most discriminating adult while being entirely without child or maiden aunt- inappropriate content.  Fascinating story, visually beautiful and intricate scenes, truly excellent for everyone.
147674355X|5.0|I loved this storyline. I was truly an amazing read. I can not wait for the next book by this author to be released.
B000O77SRC|5.0|This is of course the original Bruce Willis outing.  This is where he went from tv guy to big movie star.  He deserves the attention.  What more can I say?  Want to keep guys happy:  this is one of the top few essentials
B0079R8KO0|5.0|what a great product. It is nifty. I would definitely recommend this to someone else to use. very good product
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|One of my favorites, ever.  Love Bill Murray, love Andie Mac Dowell.  This is highly entertaining and very well done.  Had to have a copy
1623420148|5.0|such an amazing story. I loved the characters and the storyline. So so good. Cant wait to read the next one.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|This was on my collection builder list.  Needed a copy.  You know, stuff to watch on bad tv days.  Only the best moves will do.  This is unique because this kid from a trailer park is recruited by aliens to go and do the starfighter thing for real instead of just on a game.  It's like a kid's dream come true, and it is very well done.
B008J34466|5.0|great music. I loved this cd. It was so wonderful to listen to. I cant wait for another one to come out
B003LR5BD0|5.0|It's creepy, though.  Really, really creepy.  Seems like the greater the comic talent the more creepy the comic can be  This character is someone you would not want to meet.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I'm not a huge sci-fi buff, but I enjoyed the X-Files... This series is sort of X-File-ish.  What has really kept me coming back to it is the Character development.  The overall story seems to be rather predictable... but it could still surprise me.
B00BEIYOHC|5.0|So back in 2011 Insidious came out and it was made a low budget film. Nothing to Great, but once it hit theaters it shocked audiences. When I came in to watch it I was blown away with the music choices they had, it set up a great tone for the movie and I must say Insidious is one of the best horror films of 2011 and so on. Most horror films suck these days only a few stand out. Now we have Insidious 2 and when the trailer came out I got so excited I clicked on it and loved it. I can't wait to see it sept 14. I've seen positive reviews and I know it will be great. James Wan never disappoints. The plot to the second film is more of supernatural mystery film. I can't wait.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|My wife and I loved Einaudi music. It was the first time to listen to it. After listening to his &#34;Islands&#34; album, we ordered to other deferent albums of his music. It is very relaxing and makes you fly far in your imagination.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|A little too political for my taste.  All in all it kept my interest.  Looking forward to a novel like The Gatehouse
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So me and my friend played this and said it is better than Temple Run.And I have every temple run. I love this game. It is more challenging than Temple Run.
B005LAII44|4.0|I was not expecting this to be as good as the first G.I. Joe, but it turned out to be as good as the first or better. I thought that it was fantastic.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Such a great show. Incredible character interactions, great acting, and intriguing episode plots. One of the best shows I have seen in years.
B00CFA222M|4.0|After al of the hype for this movie I was astounded by what it really was, me and my wife both thoight that this was so differant ten what has been comming out that we really enjoyed it.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|There are major country tones in this album but they are still good. When you hear one of John's albumns for the first time you are disappointed, but the more you listen to them the more you find you love them. You are expecting the same music from the last albumn and then get surprised that he has mastered a new set of notes and tones. I am 60 and I think John is my favortie artist of all time, he is right up there with Eric Clapton on the guitar. I will buy everything he produces.
B0058SNI94|4.0|I bought these to wear for my new teaching job. With spending 6 hours a day on my feet, I need something comfortable to wear & it will soon be too cold for sandals. These shoes were ALMOST perfect. I wear a size 7.5 in a sandal and an 8.5 in sneakers (to accommodate for socks). The other reviews indicated that these ran big, so I ordered an 8. Unfortunately, they just did not fit as expected. My toes felt crowded! I have returned these and will get a size 9 next time.<br /><br />On the plus side, the inside of the shoes felt very &#34;cushion-y&#34; and comfortable. Since it is getting colder now than when I originally purchased these, I might opt for a Mary Jane style instead.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|A truly incredible story extremely well told.  Follett does the real world equally as well as fiction.<br />Depth of the research is impressive.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|My son refused to go to bed until I finished reading these stories to him, and when I was done, he checked to make sure I had read them all. I really admire how King Samuel Benson presents these thrilling tales. I can't wait for a third collection!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|The Merriam Webster dictionary gives a brief definition of a words meaning.  It has a favorites and also a word of the day
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception brings a interesting plot with a very good script. Pure Nolan scriptwriting. Dubois, intricate yet interesting and captivating. A must see.
B00EE3FTNM|1.0|Absolutely nothing to recommend watching this show. Didn't care for most of the charactors, may watch the final episode just to see who dunnit.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great style of writing. Was unable to put the book down from start to finish. A whirlwind of adventure and mystery.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a really good strategy game. My girlfriend and I both have this on our phones and now we're starting all over, and she's unlocked everything!<br /><br />So get past the idea of trying to eradicate humanity and let your inner evil genius come out to play.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews, but the poor average customer rating of season 3 on Amazon is unjustified.  Look at the ratings of season 1 and 2 and you'll see somewhere between 400-500 reviews with an average ratings over 4.  Season 3 is just as good, going all out with massive action scenes and great cinematography.  Although, some of the stalwart characters are no longer around, there are new characters who are just as entertaining.  It is an American series, but a triumph for the New Zealand and Australian cast who were part of this production.<br /><br />If you want to watch something exciting about a piece of history that everybody knows only by name, but little of what it was about, in a style similar to 300 (the movie), then Spartacus is it.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I'd recommend watching this if you remember the original as a stupid, jokey action movie. This was an action movie, and straightforwardly so. No stellar acting or anything - but a quality action flick, without the stupid jokey-ness of the original. I was surprised, and pleasantly so. Lots of swearing and blood, lots of action, and a reasonably well thought out plot.
B00821OX98|5.0|I have not yet finished the first season however from what I have seen so far this show is pretty good. Every episode I watch I like it more.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|It goes full circle in this perfect installment of the final destination series which is saying a lot because the movies are awsone
B005M5PENG|1.0|Save your time and your money. This is NOT H50. Such a terrible disappointment and a missed opportunity to reprise a true classic.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I read the book and saw the previous release of the movie and I must say this rendering although, the rap style music sort of diminished a few party scenes, did turn out to be a more powerful movie. Kudos!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie and got hooked and decided to read the books and couldn't put them down.  I recommend to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its the best game I have ever played. I love this game. I love my horse too. The best game ever well that's what I think. Thank you who ever made this game.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Very well done.  Storyline was great, the acting was great and the action was great.  What more could you ask for.  More action scenes than  I expected and they were all very well played out.  Didn't distract from the storyline at all.  Everything was just very  cohesive till the very end.  Bang up job!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved everything about this story.<br /><br />This young girl goes out of her box so to speak to learn to survive in a world in which she doesn't feel accepted. She also meets loyal people who do not want to let her down, although she doesn't recognize this. A wonderfully thought provoking story.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This was a typical Bruce Willis movie, trying to live off the success of his previos movies. I liked it but the movie series should end.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|never did work correctly. Not much like the computer version. Deleted it from my Kindle; it wasn't worth the space consumed.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This was a typical Tom Cruise movie. A lot of action, but he needs to move on to something else. It's too predictable.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very entertaining and addictive. I have recently started playing and still trying to get a strategy. I do wish I had more time, I hate the fails.....
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I thought this was a good movie. It had good parts and very suspenseful parts. I would watch it again.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Every woman should read this book. I absolutely loved it. Very inspiring and eye opening. Great advise especially if you are contemplating going for a bigger and better job. Believe in yourself and the sky is the limit. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This story kept me intrigued from cover to cover and next book to next book. Some of the words hung me up here and there but all great, I won't ruin it by saying anything, you must read it for yourself.
0425263924|5.0|Have read a few of Sylvia Day's books and am fast becoming a fan.  Have liked all of her books that I have read so far.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Not the newest Blu-ray version. This was compiled in 2001 but highly enjoyable as always and at a bargain price. Includes bonus DVD and as I'd read reviews which mentioned disappointment with the Blu-ray update I decided to go with the 2001 version.<br />Good audio and cinematography.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Angry Birds is a beautiful game, it's fun and addicting. I play before I close my eyes, it's a great exercise with a colorful board and funny sounds.
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm a Sci fi fan, so this is right up my alley.  I think the acting is good, story line in good and so are the special effects. I'm really enjoying it.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|This is not what I expected, I didn't know that 20/20 has 2 albums with the same name.<br />These are not the songs I was looking forward to.<br />I would not recommend this purchase.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The program is outstanding. I wish I could say the same<br />about the reception. The program keep leaving the<br />screen, and there was a circle in the center of the<br />screen for the whole time. It also sounded gurbled<br />for most of the time.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|Arguabley the funniest movie ever msde began a new  genre the mocumentry. Rock and roll! Rob reiners directorial debut.very quotable
B0002VFXFE|4.0|It's a good product, but honestly, I see no difference in performance. Just another brand name product. Regardless, it's still cheap.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Very insightful and truly inspiring.One of the best self help books out there.If every one in this world follows the 4 agreements there will be happiness and love..The message that I am taking along with me after reading this book ..Be yourself and choose the right words always.Never curse yourself or your loved ones and live every moment without any guilt, regret, comparison or anger.Life will treat you the way you want it to be.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What more can I say.....it's solitaire.  You can play it anywhere/anytime.  Love that you can see the word value before submitting for play.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax is a great movie for the entire family!  We bought the Lorax on dvd we love it so much.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Bought this cd on the strength of the others we have & really enjoy.This is a really great cd but I have to say the cd probably should read 'Susan Tedeschi & Her Backing Band'.Susan's singing is superb & the musicians playing are awsum, but what's happened to Dereks'amazing instrumentals? & Mike Matttsons vocals??? This was the dissapointing aspect of this cd. Perhaps we were expecting music along the lines of Derek Trucks Band Live at Georgia Theatre with some songs sung by Susan.<br />Anyway fab Blues.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome game..addicting..can't put it down..easy to use..new friends..have no other  words to write for this rehire..they want me to do 20..nothing else
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Pete and Patrick have done it again. Love love love it. There is not a bad song on this album, like usual.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|In many ways it can be argued that this is Blackmore's Night's best album. First,Candice Night's lyric writing has matured. For the most part, the trite, predictable cliches of past efforts are largely avoided. Secondly, the weakest songs on this album are stronger than the weakest songs on previous albums. With the exception of \\"Ghost of a Rose\\" and \\"Winter Carols\\" every previous Blackmore's Night album had a couple of songs that were complete throwaways. These are songs that it sounds like it took them about 15 seconds to think up and were just tacked onto the album as filler; songs when listening to the entire CD you would just skip through to the next song. The weakest couple of songs here are quite palatable and not the least bit skippable. Third, unlike some previous Blackmore's Night cover songs, the cover songs here (I Think it's Going to Rain Today, Lady in Black and Temple of the King)all stand up quite well to the originals and are just as good if not better. Finally and most importantly, this album has the most electric guitars of any Blackmore's Night's album. When Ritchie Blackmore plays more electric guitars, that is a good thing and that alone automatically puts \\"Dancer & The Moon\\" in the running for best Blackmore's Night album.<br />  As for the standout songs, it doesn't get any better than \\"The Last Leaf\\" and \\"Somwhere Over the Sea.\\"  \\"The Last Leaf\\" has a haunting melody, new-agey, sad lyrics and is sung perfectly by Candice. I would describe this as mystical psychedelic folk. This is one of the best songs in BN's entire canon. The only complaint, and it is a minor one, is the mix. Candice's vocals boom out of the speakers and at times the backround instrumentaion can only weakly be heard. The droning cellos and woodwinds add an extra melancholy dimension to the song yet you can hardly hear them beneath Candice's overly mixed, booming voice. If this song were remixed with the cellos and woodwinds brought up in the mix it would be a perfect song in every way. Meanwhile \\"Somewhere Over the Sea\\" is already a perfect song in every way. The song is simultaneously haunting, elegant and hypnotic. Played at the appropriate volume level, it can put you in an altered state of consciousness. This is Blackmore's Night at its mellow best. I can, and have, listened to this song over and over again and never get tired of it. On previous BN's albums, during a soft ballad I would often say to myself \\"this song would be better if Blackmore added and electric guitar solo to it\\" but invariably that never occurred. Here it does and with spectacular results (I should be a creative consultant for these guys)! The song is already a 10 out of 10 but when Blackmore plays that haunting melody on the electric guitar in the middle of the song, that is simply sublime and elevates the song to an even higher level. The surprising restraint of the solo adds to the song's subtle, majestic beauty rather than inappropriately  overpowering the song. This is Blackmore's Night clicking on all cylinders. This is followed by \\"The Moon is Shining\\" which is a hard rocking version of the same song. Here Blackmore lets loose on the electric guitar and shows ahat he can do. In juxtaposition of the previous version, here the aggressiveness of the guitar soloing is appropriate due to the livlier, hard rcoking feel of the song. As noted previously the covers are excellent due to Blackmore's distinctive electric guitar stylings. Note the beginning and midsections of \\"Lady in Black\\" where a medieval melody is played on wood instruments. This melody does not exist in the original song but is a welcome creative touch here and turns the song into a medieval masterpiece.\\"Galliard\\" is the song \\"Prince Waldeck's Galliard\\" played spreeded up and with French horns added. If this song does not mentally transport you to days gone by, you have no imagination. I wish BN would perform more songs like this: strictly traditional instruments playing strictly traditional melodies with no gimmiks or embellishments. Finally, and I know this is an overused cliche, but it is true nonetheless: \\"Carry on Jon\\" (Blackmore's tribute to deceased Deep Purple bandmate Jon Lord)is worth the price of the CD alone. It is probably in the top 3 or 4 instrumantals of Blackmore's long and storied career. It has a melancholy, jazzy blues feel and Blackmore creatively plays with the notes as he improvises around the basic melody. Throughout the song but especially when Blackmore plays an ascending sequence of notes in the midsection, I can just picture Jon Lord's soul soaring higher and higher above the clouds on its way to who-knows-what heavenly realms.elodies with no gimmiks or embellishments.

B00B2GK4KW|2.0|as i said above i bought it for my grandchild and even for me its not easy to use ,unfortunatley
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|This is simply Walking Dead on steroids. Higher intensity and higher speed, it really is an \\"A works, so let's make B just like it\\" Hollywood cliche. The characters are pretty flat, there is no time for development because there's too much action. The wife and kids are rather dull and don't inspire much sympathy because their whineyness keeps endangering people. There is a little hispanic boy they save and tow around, but we know nothing about him. The energies of this film are scattered thin.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Rio is one of the most original animated movies to come along in a long time.  Love all of the characters and the way the story wraps up n the end is super cute.  Animation, voices, plot, basically everything is very well done.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Down to earth truths about the energy of God, and specific directions on how to use it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to increase their connection to the source of all.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I had been waiting to see this movie as I love Matt Damon, but this was very predictable and not believable.  It was okay once but I won't watch it again probably.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I give this book a definite 5 Stars because I've never read a book like that before. The suspense the thrills and the excitement of how the book was thought of! Thank you Suzanne Collins...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed the book because so many of us have good through tough times and this gives us hope to keep goind.
B007HJ96NO|2.0|There's a kind of European art film with a middle-aged or elderly protagonist who reflects on his life. It's as formulaic as any \\"teenagers being killed by a stalker\\" film. In \\"Cinema Paradiso\\", a successful director recalls his growing up in a town where the movie theater was the principal source of entertainment (the citizens having forgotten how to sing, dance, play instruments, etc). (Oddly, the only scene of dancing is of hetero men at a bar.)<br /><br />Most of his memories are sweet or comic, and the story plays out as a largely light-hearted reminiscence. (The only real tragedy is Alfredo being permanently blinded and horribly scarred for life when the nitrate film being projected bursts into flames and sets his face on fire.) The dialog is loaded with the clich&eacute;s one expects from films such as these. The tone is so self-aware and archly comic as to be not only irritating, but sometimes sickening. One of the films shown is a popular tear-jerker in which a man, a woman, and their children are reunited at the end. One has to wonder whether the director is poking fun at his own film.<br /><br />\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" is a sentimental, self-serving, treaclish piece of empty-headed, mechanically rendered, pointless slop. It has little to say, and finds no original way to say it. It's no surprise the Academy voters picked it as Best Foreign-Language Film -- sentimental slop sells.<br /><br />The only really good/funny/clever moments come in the last two minutes. I won't spoil them for you, should you choose to waste your time on the rest of the film.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|It did not hold my interest. I do not like books that move back in time chapter to chapter. I prefer a straight time line.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|This film is both funny, touching and at times is a tear jerker. Needless to say that Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic here. She is funny and touching. Looking for a great film to watch? Then this is the one to rent or purchase or borrow. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Love that the story continues......the characters really take shape as they get older but even more interesting is how the author keeps the antaginists involved in their lives
B005LAIIJY|3.0|The acting was the high point of this silly movie.<br /><br />The subject matter is far too serious to be made into what I viewed as a parody of Eastwood westerns. Like Clint, Foxx was larger than life and could out gun dozens of men in any given situation. For me this was a distraction to any serious point the writer may have been attempting to deliver.<br /><br />QT goes well over the top with the gore.<br /><br />The music is terrible and out of place. The subject matter is as dark as it gets, yet the music is corny and better suited for a comedy.<br /><br />Overall the film has too many silly items for me to take serious. Just to name a few we have silly music, a guy driving a wagon with a tooth attached, and a female slave named Broomhilda
B00594XOZU|5.0|I find this a very good app, I use it on my Ipod and I was very happy when I found this app on the Kindle Fire HD after I wasn't able to get on my Ipod. The only thing I would change is that I could search any kind of photo and send it with no problem, I was able to on my Ipod but not on my Kindle. Other than that 5 stars. :)
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|It's easy to use, allows you see your inbox and the email at the same time.  I didn't buy it, just used the coins that came with my Kindle. I haven't had a problem with it and since my primary email is gmail it was worth it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Dr. Chapman approaches love expression in a whole new way. Though the concepts are familiar, he lays out our love languages as the way we express love in a fresh and exciting way complete with several, real life examples. I will definitely recommend this book to other married friends. Thanks so much, Dr. Chapman.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great season of Downton Abbey, but arent they all? Full of surprises and character suspense, drama and not a disappointment!
0425252868|5.0|terrific stuff; I have read several Battle of the Bulge books: this is about the people involved and heroes. Good vision of the germans and their hurt. My air force commander was in one of those camps for officers and air force types. Heroes all.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|Good read - bit disappointed in the end but if you continue with the series it pays off - cant wait for the last one

B00DDXJRJG|1.0|So at first I figured you could enhance the volume and quality of music on your Kindle Fire HD but when I used it , the sound was ruined. So then I go to watch Netflix on my fire and I couldn't hear the people talking, just the background music. So then I deleted this app and tried to listen to music. NOTHING CHANGED!!! So now I'm gonna have to toy around with this thing.<br />I Do Not Recommend this app!!!<br />Good thing I got it when it was the free app of the day!!!!

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved the film it was great to bring back kahn the movie was non stop action from the word go
B00280LYHS|5.0|Rick Riordan knows how to write endings that are greatly satisfying. If you've read any of the other Percy Jackson books this is a must read.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|The story line is good, some surprises (especially at the end); his depiction of isolated Wyoming life is accurate.  And I learned much about local Indian lore.  But I had a lot of trouble following the dialogue because I could never figure out just who was talking.  It was a major distraction.  Very poor choice of titles.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Hubby and I went to see this in the theater for our anniversary. We thought, it's a zombie flick and a Brad Pitt flick, surely we can't go wrong with this. Sadly we were mistaken. Hubby says \\"It's very seldom I ever get bored with a zombie movie\\" and that's just what happened. There were a few new twists to the zombie theme, though precious few and not enough to keep an audience entertained. About 30 minutes in we were ready to leave and that's pretty sad since we don't get to get out much. There was one good \\"jump\\" point, where the zombie jumps out at an unexpected moment, but the rest of the movie had us predicting what was going to happen next. I gave it two stars, one for Brad Pitt, just because I think he's a good actor even though this movie bombed, and one for the zombie that made me jump, lol. But that's about it. This could have been good, but it wasn't, Sad Face.

B00E8B1358|2.0|This film took an already poor film down several notches. It is extremely predictable and does little character development.zVery much a blow up cartoon movie.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Amazing insight into what it must be like to be someone who isn't always able to keep up and how others view them.  Broke my heart when he came to the realization that he was more of a target than a friend - worse when he began to lose it.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. Great read for all ages!! I loved it in my teens and I love it in my 30's. it opens an entirely new world.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Tom Cruise was great as usual, the ladies with him were great, music and move were stunning visually and good plot!
B008UX2UIO|5.0|There is no way to categorize this book.  It is a parody and a commentary on people and society often dark, crude and absurd, yet surprising and funny.  John Kennedy Toole wrote this one masterpiece, unlike any other book, published after his suicide.
6305428042|5.0|With Friday the 13th yesterday, and October approaching, I'm really getting into the Halloween groove. When it comes to my favorite childhood Halloween movies my top three were always Hocus Pocus, Casper Meets Wendy, and Halloweentown II. After just watching HP it's easy to remember why it always made the top of the list. The movie is funny and I feel had a great cast. The cinematography is beautiful for a Disney movie and the story is wonderful. Great for all ages but watching it as a child is nothing short of magical. If you don't own this movie, BUT IT!
B00BFV1JZI|3.0|The least engaging of the trilogy, but offers a somewhat satisfying conclusion. If you've read the other two its a safe bet you'll tear through this one.
B00340LM8C|5.0|This is probably the best of the Cary Grant movies and with an excellent cast starring the beautiful  and gracious Grace Kelly it embodies the enjoyment of watching two actors that are believable together. I recommend this as a classic
B005721Y7Y|4.0|*American Beauty* follows the lives of characters each looking for what they consider authenticity in their lives. Each character seeks a real life by in his or her own way by questing for beauty. *American Beauty,* explores ways that a group of people behold each other at a distance and how in eventually coming closer, they lose that once driving force of an objectifying sense of beauty and gain a more real relationship. While at a distance they engage in objectifying each other, up-close they face their true honest intersubjectivity--an I-and-Thou relationship. It is interesting to watch the film's trailer (which you can do on Amazon Instant Video), because the trailer repeatedly flashes the message, \\"Look closer.\\" The beauty that from a distance is exaggerated and therefore extraordinary, becomes when lived close up at the same time ordinary but more meaningful and more real. The film plays with this question about these two kinds of beauty in a number of ways.<br /><br />In *American Beauty,* protagonist and narrator Lester Burnham invites into his own life review. And we are left with the question of having looked closer did he find beauty. The film seems to play with the idea of idealized objectified beauty fading in the presence of honest up-close beauty with its complexities. The film's title is almost ironic: the \\"America\\" of *American Beauty* is suburbia; the \\"beauty\\" of *American Beauty* is the fantasy of love at a distance. But when the superficial shell of American suburbia breaks, true beauty is revealed.<br /><br />I see this film as presenting beauty as if it might be an inalienable right, as if one might say \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of...beauty.\\" But what of happiness? None of the characters in the movie seem happy, except maybe in the way Lester does in that he is the only \\"free\\" character in the film, the only character who answers to no higher authority than himself. Beauty for most of the characters in this film is their experience of spirituality and liberation from the ordinary rounds of life.<br /><br />In all the film's characters' quests each only fulfill themselves after he or she fails to get what they think they want. Lester in a sense renounces the world. He quits his job at a media magazine and pursues weightlifting. One night at the dinner table he exposes the banality of the suburban life his wife strives to maintain. Lester embarks on a weight-lifting program because the teenage girl to whom he is sexually attracted, a friend of his daughter Jane named Angela--a girl who boasts of her many acts of sexual promiscuity--comments to Jane that she would like to see Lester naked and Lester overhears this. But in the end Lester finds that he really does not want what he dreams of. Lester gives up being a \\"luster.\\"<br /><br />Each of the characters sees beauty from a distance and when they come close to the object of their beauty it becomes elusive. Finally Lester's nobility of restraint becomes his beauty. Beauty emerges here when everyone lets go of their pretenses. Nonetheless Lester had experienced the beauty of the young Angela and that beauty drove his quest. Teenage next-door neighbor Ricky, a classmate of Jane and Angela, finds and speaks of a beauty so intense that he could almost burst but, he pursues beauty through the lens of his video camera. Just as Lester is looking and listening into Angela's life, so too is Ricky looking into Jane's life by videotaping her as often as possible.<br /><br />In a sense *American Beauty* is a tragedy in that no one gets what they want, and for those who do, they find it unrewarding and disappointing. Although as many reviewers complained, the characters lack depth, the question of their pursuits and quests invites us to contemplate how and where we each find beauty in our own lives. *American Beauty* raises the questions of what is a life beautifully lived and where and how do we find beauty when we look closer. What is beauty when we \\"look closer?\\"<br /><br />(As an addendum to this review I wish to mention that I am intrigued that at 1:23 the soundtrack samples the Who's \\"Seeker.\\" At one level this of course identifies Lester as a \\"seeker.\\" But also noticed that the trailer samples the Who's \\"Baba O'Reilly.\\" And the film's credits give \\"Special thanks to Pete Townshend,\\" who is of course, the guitarist and songwriter for the Who. What intrigues me is that as many of the famous songs of the Who touch on Avatar Meher Baba, I am led to wonder about this connection between director Alan Ball's intentions and the spiritual messages of Pete Townshend's music.)
140006922X|4.0|When Reza Aslan was being raked over the coals by every conservative pundit for writing a book on the life of Jesus of Nazareth when he himself is a Muslim (though he was a Christian for a time; he returned to the faith of his childhood), well, I simply HAD to see what the fuss was all about.  Besides I knew it had to make for an interesting read.<br /><br />And I was not disappointed.  This is a challenging and fascinating take on who Jesus of Nazareth might really have been.  We Christians tend to read the original Christian writings, like the letters of Paul, through the filter of the Gospels even though none of the Gospels were written until some forty years after the Crucifixion.<br /><br />Perhaps naturally, I don't agree with all of Aslan's conclusions.  For one thing he believes that Jesus was illiterate.  My reading has led me to a different conclusion, but it is only fair to Aslan to note that there are Christian scholars who think Jesus was illiterate also.<br /><br />Slightly more problematic is his treatment of the Gospel material.  He contradicts himself in several places; for example, he starts out basically dismissing all of the Gospels as pure fiction because of the time lapse I have already noted, then later he uses material from the Gospels to make points that he could not possibly make if you accept the argument that the Gospels are fiction.  He's also all over the map when it comes to his source material.<br /><br />Still, this is by far the most interesting read I've had about Jesus in a while.  Agree or disagree, it is undeniable that Aslan makes the reader think.

1400064287|5.0|It is a great book with lots of helpful examples and information. It is a touch clinical therefore the 4.5 stars instead of a full 5 stars. I would definitely buy this book agains and recommending to anyone in marketing or messaging.

B0000UJL96|4.0|This was a good, strong way to end the Original Series movies. The plot was stronger than the plot of Star Trek V (which I personally enjoyed a lot, but was not as objectively good as Star Trek VI), and the ending felt very conclusive. I wish they had just let this movie be the end of the original series rather than doing Generations. It was also nice to see the gaps between TOS and TNG bridged with regards to the Klingons, which this movie did nicely.

B009GIPDQS|3.0|Could have been better! John's work is no more as good as what used to be before, hope next one is better.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|This movie has the reputation of being the worst Star Trek movie in the series, which is a pretty gross exaggeration, in my opinion. It wasn't perfect, and it wasn't quite as entertaining as Star Trek IV (nothing is), but I found it likable and fun. The tone was a bit odd at some points -- it wasn't always sure whether or not to take itself seriously, unlike the previous Star Trek movies which were a little more consistent -- but the funny parts really landed, at least to me.<br /><br />I liked the revelation of Spock having a half-brother and found Sybok to be a fun character, all things considered. I also liked Shatner's directing overall, though not as much as Nimoy's, of course. (Except for the cat woman with three breasts. What was up with that, Bill?)<br /><br />I also really loved the relationship between Uhura and Scotty as it was shown in the movie, and as much as I love Spock and Uhura in Abrams' movies, a pretty big part of me wishes he'd put Uhura with Scotty instead.<br /><br />All in all, it was a pretty enjoyable movie. Not as good as Wrath of Khan or The Voyage Home, but definitely worth watching and a lot better than it's reputation suggests.

B007AL48UK|4.0|The different Mahiong games are challenging to complete, especially the surf waves one.  You are rated from one to three stars, but the game does not tell you how the rating works.  I was able to get a three star rating on all but the surf waves.  One issue that could occur is trying to tap a tile that isa close to another and getting the wrong tile.  Some of the tiles can be so close together that hitting the wrong tile will happen.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!  It is so fun.  All it really is is a more fun version of temple run.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|Is this the best movie ever made?  No.  It is, though, a fun movie to watch.  Russell does a fairly good job displaying various emotions (which is a struggle for his character) throughout the movie little to no dialogue.  The idea of super soldiers is an old one, but this movie deals with what to do with them when they are 'obsolete'.<br />You need to suspend disbelief to watch this movie.  Yes, nobody could survive what appears to be a long space flight in a trash ship.  Just forget about things like that when you see 'Soldier'.  Other reviewers have torn apart all the things that don't make sense.  If I did that to every movie, I would find it hard to actually enjoy any movies.<br />Watch this for what it is, an action movie.  Look past the bad music, low budget special effects and mute little boy - all my opinion.  The soundtrack is a little annoying, but not completely terrible.  However, I didn't like the little boy's part in the movie.  Yes, I know he was there to show the humanity of Russell's character, but it was too hokey for me.<br />Overall, I really do like this movie.  I've see it numerous times and always enjoy it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|.<br /><br />  I was fascinated by his life.  He was quite a control freak so I was glad to see that he gave his partner credit for developing the apple computer.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I base my reviews on whether or not I enjoyed the movie - I don't pick movies apart for small/technical details.  That being said, I really did enjoy this movie.  Yeah, the special effects were indicative of a lower budget movie.  The story itself was very interesting and entertaining.  The movie is fast paced with great action.  Instead of being all over the place, the bulk of the movie takes place in one location - that location is a huge 'apartment' building.<br />Urban does a great job as Dredd.  He doesn't play it over the top - he's plays Dredd very straight forward.  I think that was key to my enjoyment to the movie.<br />I read a lot of reviews going through every minute detail of movies.  I don't do that at all.<br />I had a great time watching this movie because it reminded me of quite a few of the fun action movies from the '80s.  Just good action and justice!
B00AEFYSEA|3.0|I found the film to be too violent.  I am sure there is some truth to it  when you consider the time and place  in our history.....  But I do consider that era fascinating.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|If was a about real life; it was a respectful movie that teaches real life lessons; one being not to forget what love feels like and how important it is to love! I have seen this movie several times and I love it even more each time I view it.
6304711905|4.0|This was a good movie about a town that made history.  The silver mines, the cowboys and the Earps all contributed to making the town immortal.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Like the game.  Reminds me of Medal of Honor.  Just dont want to spend money to get the really good weapons.  Although the unlock weapons really arent that bad.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun, fast and addictive! My kids love this game... How could you pass up on a minion? We could not do it!!!
B00CKYB3R8|1.0|I didnt want to stream I thought I was buying the video. the directions were unclear and I am upset about it
B00CSV7AFC|3.0|Debut release from band out of Montreal, Canada.  With songs built around sublime vocal harmonies and folk music that gently lends itself to acoustic experimentation--plus occasional tribal/shuffle rhythms that deviate into elegant, soaring pop-ballad journeys--HMR lay down a hypnotic trail of quietly attractive, mysterious music for open-minded indie connoisseurs.  Recalls artists like Fleet Foxes, Coldplay, Bombay Bicycle Club, Shearwater, Radiohead, Low.  I find parts of this album really nice, slightly strange and easy on the ear; but some of it feels too hipster/pretentiously smooth and pretty.  50/50, your call.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Great suspense, real page turner  Baldacci does it again.  Has the chemistry to make the reader stay glued to the text
B009RX8AQW|5.0|The show series is entertaining and engaging.  It is fun to watch and follow the story line.  I would recommend to anyone.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|When I got it I found the case and DVD to be in mint condition and I had high hopes for the quality of the movie.  Upon playing it the sound seemed muffled and not great quality.  Visually it was ok, but overall not great.  The second disk which was all the &#34;making of&#34; stuff seemed much better in quality, though.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It made me think of all the lives lost, and the ordeal of trying to find loved ones in a state of disaster.
B00BD62X14|3.0|Former first lady of France has a lovely voice but it was not showcased properly in these songs.<br />  It is an album that perhaps will grow on you in time.<br />I think a bigger sound with an orchestra would suit her better singing Edith Piaf classics.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Good so far. Maybe could use a little more info in the beginning still slightly confused about some things. Enjoy it so far though.
0517548232|5.0|This is a very good and timely book. It's a downright shame that it was written in 1946 and governments around the world have not heeded the simple lesson and practical applications advanced in this work.<br /><br />It's divided into three sections:<br /><br />Part One: The Lesson<br /><br />With one chapter, \\"The Lesson\\" - in which he asserts: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\" (p. 17)<br /><br />Part Two: The Lesson Applied<br /><br />Here is the bulk of the book in which he goes into the particulars of applying that one simple lesson to various situations, including (but not limited to): public works programs, taxes, tarrifs, governments \\"rescuing\\" businesses, price-fixing, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, inflation, and saving. He ends the section with a restatement of the lesson and how if applied it would enable success on such a grander scale than what we've come to see in our own lifetimes since the government did not apply this lesson but did just the opposite.<br /><br />A few potent quotes to help you understand his view:<br /><br />\\"When they say that the way to economic salvation is to increase credit, it is just as if they said that the way to economic salvation is to increase debt: these are different names for the same thing seen from opposite sides. ... When they say, under nearly all conditions, that the way to recovery is to increase wage rates, they have found only another way of saying that the way to recovery is to increase costs of production.\\" (p. 193)<br /><br />\\"But the solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily, to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its value.\\" (p. 199)<br /><br />\\"And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than as producer, are considered.<br /><br />\\"To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.\\" (p. 199)<br /><br />Part Three: The Lesson After Thirty Years<br /><br />This is another one chapter \\"part\\" in which the author did the unfortunate task of detailing (though clearly not exhaustively) how our country (and others) have not paid attention to the soundness of this lesson and how we have since continued to suffer the consequences:<br /><br />\\"Governments everywhere are still trying to cure by public works the unemployment brought about by their own policies. ... Governments still provide special encouragements to unprofitable industries. ... They not only retain minimum wage laws but keep increasing their level, in face of the chronic unemployment they so clearly bring about.\\" (p. 208)<br /><br />In short, the more the government gets involved in the market economy, the worse the market economy does. While the book lends itself toward a depressing note toward the end, the author does leave the reader hopeful in the significant rise that: \\"Conservatives, libertarians, and other defenders of free enterprise are becoming more outspoken and more articulate.\\" (p. 211)<br /><br />It's my hope that many truly will read this great work, think through these concepts with clarity, and then be inspired to become such defenders of free enterprise!to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than as producer, are considered.<br /><br />\\"To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.\\" (p. 199)<br /><br />Part Three: The Lesson After Thirty Years<br /><br />This is another one chapter \\"part\\" in which the author did the unfortunate task of detailing (though clearly not exhaustively) how our country (and others) have not paid attention to the soundness of this lesson and how we have since continued to suffer the consequences:<br /><br />\\"Governments everywhere are still trying to cure by public works the unemployment brought about by their own policies. ...

B0089EHWQE|4.0|Lou loses her loved but unchallenging job as a café worker and the only other work she can find is as a non-medical care giver to Will, a quadriplegic. When she meets him, he is not at all the sickly person she had envisioned, but a former daredevil who has lost hope in the face of his unending limitations. Will's abrasiveness and scathing intelligence challenges her. Lou's openness and humor revives him. Together they make each other happy, but is it enough to overcome the increasing deterioration of Will's body and his frustration with the life he has now, as compared to the life he used to live?<br /><br />I thought this was a well-written story. I really liked the characters--they were likable, 3-dimensional and real enough to make me want to cry at certain points  without feeling like my emotions were being manipulated. I thought Lou's family had an interesting dynamic; they were a fun bunch and I was bummed when the scene shifted and we left for Will's family which was much flatter, emotionally (though maybe that's just an upper class Brit's usual M.O.)<br />Some chapters shifted from Lou's perspective to other characters, I assume, because the author couldn't figure out how to impart certain information any other way. However, because it was so sporadic, it felt somewhat contrived.<br />Although I would have liked to have seen more in the epilogue, it told enough to imagine the rest and was (partially) satisfying.<br /><br />The only thing I found hard to believe is how Will was treated in public at times--as if it was 1850 and not the 21st Century. Has no one seen someone in a wheel chair before? Seriously? Maybe this is just how people are treated in England (where the story takes place) but I can't imagine someone who is handicapped being treated so rudely. I'm sure there are public places where it's difficult to maneuver a wheel chair but most places I've seen have accommodations and workers are usually trained to help those who need it without fuss. Itwas kind of horrifying, also, how people would stare and whisper. It just makes me sad that people can still be so thoughtless and, I assume, frightened by someone who is different. It was disconcerting and upsetting to read.<br /><br />In any case the story was entertaining and definitely kept my interest. Still, some very sad moments which will stay with me for a while. The author either did her homework very well or knows someone with a similar injury. The details were extremely realistic.<br />Mostly, I knew where this story was going from the beginning. But it was a nice ride getting there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's realistic and fun! The kids love it and it's a real time buster for me I recommend it for sure
B0047SKR54|3.0|I do not like letter-boxed versions of these movies!  Love the movie, hate this format.  Show me something that fills up my screen.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Makes you use your thinking cap.  Fun way to challenge your brain!  That's all for now, Amazon needs to cut down their word count requirement!
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Everybody likes different styles, and this one is a departure for her. The cd starts more popish, and transcends to a more country sound, which wasn't necessary because she does a pop-country song very well. She'll probably never really sell herself as a true country artist, but that hasn't hurt most of the present &#34;country&#34; artists. I'll place this album equal to my other favorite of hers, &#34;C'mon&#34;, so its pretty damn good.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The characters are engaging with twists and turns in the story line.  Always something different. Good variety of characters and plots.
B0035JNTA6|1.0|Fell asleep watching it.  No meaningful story line - acting was silly bad.  Cursing in it just to be Cursing, and I know how to curse and when to.  Just a waste of time.  Somebody in Hollywood must have had money to invest and pay these people because they liked them as friends.  i cannot think of one redeeming quality about it.  I would rather watch rocks break up to make sand.  There was not star to rate this movie as a minus 5 stars for wasting my time in life that I cannot get back.  They owe me. .

B0002TJGQS|5.0|This a great price for 5 Maxell batteries. They cost much more if bought at a retail store. I have many uses for this type of battery (camera, computer, etc.).
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I really enjoyed it but not as good as Pillars of the Earth.<br /><br />I will be reading more by him
B009JBZH54|5.0|The copy I purchased is missing the film disc for The Dark Knight Rises. There are only four discs, and an empty holder where the last movie would go. Possibly a bad production run. I will update this review when/if the issue is resolved.<br /><br />Update: The return process was fairly painless, and I now have the complete set. Hopefully the omission was an isolated incident. I have updated the review to five stars because this is probably the best live-action Batman we will ever get. It strays from the most enduring and \\"truest\\" versions of the comics characters, but it is still recognizably Batman. It is never boring, and engages intellectually as well as emotionally. Read the commentary surrounding the release of TDK and watch the creators twist and contort as they try to deny the obvious political allegory (or applicability, if you prefer). These are movies of their time, capturing a zeitgeist that may seem foreign to future generations, but they will have timeless value as explorations of the sheep-wolf-sheepdog triad.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I just watched the first episode this summer, now in September I am on season 5. It is truly addicting.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|This movie reminded me of another film, (Stand by me). With two adventurous boys who must learn how to grow up way too fast. It's yet another guy wants girl, guy can't have girl type movie but with an interesting story line about life and love and growing up.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very addicting. my granddaughter was visiting and downloaded it. My husband got board and checked it out and now he  can't stop playing it.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|Silhara, the &#34;Master of Crows&#34; is a reviled mage who finds himself in the unenviable position of being courted by an evil god. This evil god is rather determined to get Silhara as his enslaved avatar, so Silhara sends to the hated Conclave for an apprentice to help him find a way out. Martise, a slave owned by the High Bishop of the Conclave, is sent to his home in this capacity, having been told that if she finds evidence of Silhara's heresy, she will be freed from slavery.<br /><br />I loved this book. I totally fell in love with Silhara, his bad-temperedness, his rumpled/scowling morning manner, and his directness with Martise. When he decided he wanted her, and that no substitute would do, he accepted it with no prolonged, tormented anguish about how she was a spy. He made the realization, made his decision, and then made his move. It was a nice change from over-angsting woe-is-me heroes, who anguish and act like jackasses towards the heroine because of their inability to make a resolution between facts of the world and their emotional needs. (end rant)<br /><br />I also liked Martise. Her life has trained her to hold her tongue and be submissive, and her position as a servant/spy in Silhara's household reinforces this. Yet of course she finds herself being goaded into rebelliousness by Silhara's manner. And I liked how she could see through Silhara's claims of being immoral, and find humour.<br /><br />Speaking of humour, I also really enjoyed how their relationship played out with rather humorous interactions that were intertwined with the plot. For example, Martise is trying to communicate with the High Bishop of the Conclave, who has told her that she must sing to his trained crow in order to send messages. Only, Martise has a very poor singing voice and Silhara's horrified reaction to it had me laughing. I also loved Silhara's attempt to assuage Martise's worry about her nudity when he is applying a salve to her sore muscles: he tells her that he had grown up in a brothel, and that unless she had something really unique, like three breasts, he wouldn't be curious enough to ogle her. I particularly loved how this came to be a joke between them when their interactions turned romantic. Like the previously mentioned interaction, this scene is fluidly interwoven with the plot - Silhara only notices Martise's soreness when he tries to avoid giving her magic lessons, and this avoidance was a consequence of his struggle with the god that is trying to make him his avatar.<br /><br />As for the storyline, I loved how Martise's hidden magical &#34;gift&#34; (while it did come to save the day in the end), is, in the scale of things, a terrible thing that is of no use to her. It's so often the case that the hero/heroine in PNR realizes their hidden talents, and these talents are deus ex machina, For Martise, her hidden gift is primarily a way to bind and enslave her, and not a way for her to get power. So often these hidden gifts are escape hatches, and instead, Martise's gift is a terrible weakness. As a reader, I had expected it to be something wonderful, and when it turned out not to be, I sympathized with her as she grieved, and felt that her grief make her a stronger character mentally. This twist in the plot also introduced an (additional) complication into Martise and Silhara's relationship, as Silhara's magical disposition is such that he could take advantage of her weakness. Seeing them acknowledge this and deal with this (especially Silhara's piss-poor attempts at comfort) made their relationship feel much more real. I also love how Silhara, at this point, doesn't pull a standard alpha-male reaction and tell Martise that he'll protect her. Rather, he asks her to let him give her the means to protect herself.<br /><br />The writing style was smooth and gorgeous. I'm really looking forward to anything else Grace Draven comes out with.
B001BANK32|5.0|I thought the book might be better than the movie. It was a little different. It was Fantastic!!  Loved the book and the movie!!
B000FC13Y0|4.0|This is a throw back to the type of Fantasy that was written before LOTR became all the rage and everything had elves, dwarves and orcs.  It's a fun filled tale that rollicks it's way out of the old English countryside and straight into your heart. It's the type of story I plan on reading to my children, chapter by chapter, before they fall asleep.
B00DHNJ80K|2.0|this movie there was no twist or anything ten minutes in to the movie you can tell whats going to happen
B000FCK65W|5.0|I don't know how I missed reading this classic years ago. It is a beautifully written, haunting story - ultimately one of hope.
B000058DFO|5.0|Due to my narrow mindedness and tunnel vision of what I thought the Motown Sound should be or what I wanted it to be, I missed out on Syreeta. Any recording artist under the Motown umbrella, that didn't fit my Motown mold, I tuned out. Thanks to Universal Music Company I can enjoy a sampling of Syreeta's artistry. Her voice is bright, the songs are right, and the production is tight. With Stevie Wonder as a co-writer and producer, how could she miss being a hit? Maybe there were too many Motown FANatics like me, who could not appreciate the variety of musical sounds coming from Hitsville U.S.A., back in the day. If I had been a better listener, I would have picked up on Syreeta as a songstress that I wanted to hear.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A complete surprise from beginning to end. This is what they mean by the phrase, \\"A real page turner.\\" The best I've read in quite a while.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I don't have Facebook. Since that is the only way to \\"log in\\" I don't get to use my real name and I do think it makes it harder for me to win and score points... since I'm only a guest, I don't think I get treated the same.  Annoying!  I am never going to join the Facebook cult and it is too bad this game tries to force you to join. At some point I will just quit because of this. I suppose I could join Facebook but honestly I think there is something so wrong about that \\"thing\\"
1781162646|4.0|Very enjoyable beach, bus or bed reading from the modern master, Stephen King.<br />After a long break from reading anything by Big Steve, I was delighted by Joyland.<br />He manages to tell a story that covers familiar ground but still seems fresh.<br />Recommended.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it because I get to fight zombies and creepers the downside is you don't have as much stuff as on computor.

1596912855|4.0|I was at the movies the other day, and saw a preview for a movie based on this book. The movie looked like a lot of fun, and when I got home, I realized I had the book on my shelf, so wanted to read it before seeing the movie. It was very entertaining, I am not one of the Austen fanatics, but do like books written about Austen fans. This one follows 32 year old Jane Hayes, a graphic designer in  NYC, who is obsessed by Colin Firth in his role as Mr Darcy  from Pride and Prejudice and non of her real life boyfriends can never live up to expectation. As publishers weekly states: \\"Jane is forced to confront her Austen obsession when her wealthy great-aunt Carolyn dies and leaves her an all-expenses-paid vacation to Pembrook Park, a British resort where guests live like the characters in Jane's beloved Austen novels.\\" It is a fun story, following the actors and guests as they try and sort out what is real and what is acted. Great characters and a good way of seeing how it would be to live in those times.

B00957T6X6|2.0|After watching only one TV episode of &#34;game of thrones&#34; - and loving every moment of it - I decided to buy the whole book series, as I am an avid reader. Book one was good, as was book five. But the ones in between are not. These are filled with endless repetitions and pointless ending storylines. Another irritating habit  is the  build-up of tension towards a battle or major event. But this main event is seldom described in detail as it unfolds. The info is given to you almost offhanded, in a few short sentences, at the start of yet another chapter. However, there is a lot of detail in the tedious description of the endless number of  clans, houses and figurants, how they are dressed and what they eat at banquets. So if you are into this kind of reading, you'll love it.<br /><br />But to be fair, there is an upside : the plotting, scheming and treacherous desires of men and women are nicely framed , stressing the &#34;game&#34; in the &#34;game of thrones&#34;. But it goes on and on, and  wears thin after a book or three.<br /><br />My advice : if you want to read the story, only buy and read the last book (number five). If you want the whole story, buy the DVD series and watch it on TV.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Like so many legal shows, the characters seem to know all areas of the law but Mike and Harvey are just fun as a pair. Also, it is a show you can media binge through.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Good flick. Like most Bruce Willis movies it is over-the-top, but provides fun entertainment. Good for an evening in with the spouse.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book answers so many questions as well as raises so many more that I as a professed Christian have long had.  While I was sometimes frustrated by the author's failure to include sources from some of his assertions, it did not detract from the thesis
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Terrific book. Quick read. The film version captured it excellently. Clever ending. Well told. If you've seen the film, there are no real surprises in the novel.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|I love LEGOs because it is a toy that my girls have to think to play with!

This is great for encouraging sophisticated dramatic play and working on visual-spacial concepts.

B00AYR2FOI|4.0|This album is a good return to form after the ill advised standards covers ala Rod Stewart (mind you Rod is god awful too). Forget the classic standards Boz, you're not Sinatra okay? Stick with soul music, that's what you do best, and you kick ass with it. Recommended.
0988178532|4.0|All I can say is WOW I am curious of what was running through Brandt Legg's mind when he wrote this book. It instantly captures your attention from page one and won't let go until then end, even then you are seduced into wanting more literary pleasure. This coming of age story explores worlds that are unimaginable, yet the way he describes these ridiculously awesome places is simply amazing. Although I know this book is without a doubt fiction, I couldn't help but to get a sense of reality in the mist of this incredible tale of brotherhood and friendship fused with the unexplainable mystic powers and secrets of this inner movement. I am still in awe from the conclusion and all the revelations that were unfolded in this spectacular fantasy, suspense thriller. I will definitely be purchasing the sequals to this trilogy.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I bought this because I liked a few of his songs, and it was a great price.  Lucky move for me.  This guy has some major talent and I don't see an end in sight.  I am looking foward to checking out his other cds.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Robert Redford does a great job by doing what he does best.  The woman in the center of this movie truly was the most misunderstood character in this ring of conspirators.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I haven't actually received it yet in the mail but I hear it's her best movie. She is a very beautiful woman and an excellent actress so I'm sure I'm going to enjoy it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I saw this movie twice in theaters and absolutely loved it!  Admittedly, the biggest draw for me was Benedict Cumberbatch (I'll keep my comments about him to myself!), but I love the rest of the cast as well. The story and dialogue are well-written and the action and special effects are AAAAAA-MAZING!!!!  So, naturally, I came here looking for a good deal on the DVD.  However, I'm VERY disappointed at the lack of special features on this and other editions. My advice: buy it elsewhere.  I know a certain vendor with a big red bull's eye for a logo that has a nice special edition combo pack (wink wink, nudge nudge)...
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I like some of he options it provides, but I don't think this is the most intuitive in terms of adding events, etc. maybe I just have had enough practice
B007I1TFK0|4.0|A must for musical lovers.<br />I love this movie and to get it in Bluray quality makes it so much more enjoyable.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|&#34;Sledgehammer's&#34; poignant and gripping account of his time in battle is a must read for those interested in these Pacific struggles. If you read only one book on the subject this should be it. While laying bare the brutality and savagery of this type of combat he maintains the ability to give a sensitive insight into the brotherhood of people in battle. It is difficult sometimes to keep in mind that these were young men, some barely of age and you marvel at the ability of most to return and lead productive lives. God bless them all.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Awesome. I have given it to several teens and they have passed it on to their friends.  Encouraging to never give up
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read Gone Girl first, and I didn't &#34;get it&#34;. I decided to give this author another chance and read this book. I loved it! There's something about these characters that I can't get enough of. I will agree that the end was pretty twisted and a bit of a throw away. I was slightly disappointed in that, but overall I enjoyed the story.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|I know that portions of the story were true to history. That made the story intriguing. Kate Blanchett was fab, she commands the English role very well.
B00014NE62|5.0|I forgotten how Cute. Hugh Grant was, that gorgeous head of hair. If you have a H.D. television you would not be disappointed, grab a bowl of dip and chips and enjoy.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|The story broke my heart, but it was full of action and looked deep into the characters minds and personalities.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|He's up there with Elijah Wood on the Eyes... Aksel is becoming one of my best, yes I would say that, I'm a fanatic.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Just a wonderful read. It was entertaining and hard to put down. Puzo's earlier works are great reads also. You feel that you become part of the story.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game is fun but you have to purchase coins to play more than two games. I am debating deleting the game.
B00471JSR4|3.0|Better than I expected. Amazing action scenes supported by extremely well done special effects. GI Joe fans will not be disappointed.
B00DJLLO0M|2.0|Overwhelming disappointment. After three excellent albums aviv has apparently decided to appeal to 11 year old girls. Bubble gum pop that S Wilson must cringe to be associated with.
B005I3PAUO|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have read. Bought it in good faith based on reading other Baldacci books. Wast of time and money
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Can't wait till Season 9 comes out in October 2013. This should be exciting to see who is in the next season.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Would recommend reading to seeown life all of a sudden spring up and walk this trail. Enters heart and soul.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you don't have time to sit down with a stone and sharpen you knives like a razor, this it the next best thing!  Handy out in the field for hunting and fishing as well.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great movie and the dvd is also great.....funny lots of laughs  good music
B0055D3EFU|1.0|Dumbest movie I ever saw. Boring and script must have been written by a 5 yr old. Whoever thought this movie was \\"good\\" or \\"scary\\" never saw a \\"good\\" or \\"scary\\" movie before. Don't waste your time or your money.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Nice tight little plot. Good read. Used the words \\"jinked around the corner\\" one to many times. Still liked it.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|This might be an ok app but Amazon's policy of having to<br />be logged in to use it stinks.  I will never purchase an app<br />from amazon for this reason.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game so much I can't get of lol get this game ahhh Jensen dachshund.  Shenanigans thanks Jansen manners bananas band Bingham Ghanaians j see hehehe
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Nice app. It's very useful, you can view your notes everywhere, and edit them. Also you can create different division!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and your children will too. If you want to have more places to go to you can upgrade it for free.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE MINE CRAFT IT IS AWESOME AND I PLAY IT WELL ALL THE TIME BUT I DON'T<br />LIKE THE MONSTERS BUT I LOVE MINE CRAFT!!!!!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille did a great job with this work - he has the reader from the first page.  He gives the reader a real feel for the area and develops the characters very well.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|Worth every penny. The quality and selection of songs is amazing. A must for every newbie into blues, or even the expert who thought he knew it all!!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I like all the stuff you get for the price. The story is cool too, but I old school and some the story makes me think of the old ones and where did they come up with the ideas they did. Must watch if you love Star Trek !!!!
B00ET7ICEQ|4.0|I don't believe it'll win any awards for the entire album but it's a very easy to listen to album and typical of what I've come to expect of Sheryl.  It'll stay in my playlist for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome my frends have this game and they beat it. I got this game two days ago and I have all of the caritors.
B00AF46Q5Y|4.0|I have enjoyed the 3 books,(the #1 and #2 were best) but would never have purchased the first if I'd known there were multiple to come.  When I read a book I like to know that when I've finished reading it has ended.  I was under the impression this was a trilogy but now have seen comments that it is 5 volumes.......too many.<br />Good marketing for the author though.
0385394233|4.0|I travel over an hour to and from work everyday unfortunately.  I'm in a book club at work, and this allows me to get my reading in on my way to and from work. I try to make the best use of my time. And the book was good reading, lots of great advice and experiences I can relate to.
0345529057|1.0|So, I nestled in bed with a good book a great book in fact. Too bad the publisher docent believe in the art of  quality control ... How do you not know 65 pages missing?
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is fantastic! The story, the graphics, the puzzles- they really draw you in. I hate to go to bed. I just want to keep playing!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|From the first page this book has you in it´s grip, the story is so compelling and the characters so real.  The story of a white girl being brought up with black slaves through unbeleivable hardship, then finding her way back into the &#34;white&#34; world but still longing to belong with her true &#34;family&#34;.  An amazing insight into both worlds and told with such understanding and passion.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My boys love to watch this over and over! Good story about false pride, working together, overcoming odds...even enjoyable to watch as an adult!
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Years ago a black friend of mine wore a bracelet inscribed with Nelson Mandela's name which she vowed never to take off until he was freed. If anyone has told me that he would someday not only be free but would be President of South Africa I would have shook my head and told them not to hold their breath.<br />In invictus Morgan Freeman gives<br /><br />stunning performance as Mandela. When asked how he can support the almost all White Springboks rugby team he says &#34;How can I expect other people. To change if I can't change myself.&#34; Mandela's political instincts were unerring and he accomplished what most reasonable people would have thought impossible-a peaceful transition from Apartheid to majority rule in South Africa. One only has to look at Zimbabwe for the more likely scenario.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game is good.I like it because of the action and adventure and action it's worth the money. It's like grand theft auto.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|At first I was unhappy with the book but the more I read the more addicted I became.  It is with out a doubt one of the best books I have read.  The pacing and story are perfect and the characters feel real.  If you liked the wheel of time then you have to read this book
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great streaming device if you have the need for what is essentially a wireless HDMI adapter.  The only downside of it is that there are not too many apps that work with it although youtube and netflix will make it worthwhile for most people.  Due to the lack of apps, I dropped it 1 star.  I recently got a laptop with Windows 8 and tried the tab sending feature.  It worked well for a while but then the video froze after a few minutes while the audio kept going.  This is a beta feature so I cannot knock them for this not working seamlessly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not easy but solvable! I enjoy it so much. Please add more level soon!  Is there any full version of it?
0307891402|5.0|This book is well put together and goes beyond being a mere game guide. Helps with details for the game and making decisions as you play.
3836532441|5.0|&#34;&#34;'  JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN EXPECTED  &#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;<br /><br />THE BOOK WAS JUST PERFECT, COULD NOT HAVE ASK FOR ANYTHING ELSE.<br />SHIPPING WAS VERY QUICK .<br />THE PRICE ( WITH THE $10.00 OFF OFFER ) WAS A EVEN GREATER SURPRISE.<br />WRAPPED BETTER THAN NEW, I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT HAD EVEN BEEN LOOKED AT.<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!  VERY HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Wouldn't call it straight on country, but rather an interpretation. Very nice selection and variety of songs. Hearkens back to less stressful times and purer themes in music.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|The kids like the game so if they are happy I can ask for anything more, a fun little game
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Works great!  No longer have to wear that Bluetooth in my ear. Volume is good also. Reasonably priced over earbuds
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The kids love this fun little game. It keeps them busy and with a big smile thank you vary much
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is the best game ever! You should buy this game because it's entertaining<br />fun awesome So buy this game!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was most fun for my daughters and me to read these at the same time! One daughter was able to handle the books better than the other, but we all enjoyed them tremendously!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Worst game ever All u do is poop and play jump rope<br />Also u just share dinosaurs and elephants and ropes
B003O86FMW|4.0|Finished the second, on to the third lots of twists and turns amid horrific scenarios I am enjoying the read
B001KOFH2G|5.0|The product was a pretty standard blu-ray product that you'd expect from anywhere. That said, the film was mind blowing!
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I love the show the cast,i wish I could meet them, I am glad they are going on Monday because of my schedule
0345803485|5.0|I really liked this book. It has a great story line and i can't wait to get the next book in the series to see what happens!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This app is great but kinda gets boring after a while. They had  lots of updates and now you have to check on it every day or you have to pay acorns.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The series had everything to keep my interest--drama, comedy, tragedy, and I was sadden about what happened at the end of the third season.  Downton brought all of the social issues that are still present in 2013 out of wedlock child birth, infidelity, homosexuality.  I wish that people had the pride today in work and the motivation to want to achieve more as a result of that work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun, with great graphics. It's by far the best horse game amazon has. I like how they give you gems for free as a gift.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The app plays great on my Kindle Fire- I had no problems with it installing- was smooth ...give it a play!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Powerfully written; masterfully acted; incitfully directed.  What television was meant to be... every iota as epic as the best motion pictures and better than some.  I gave it 5 Stars because that's all I could choose... It deserved at least 10!  Bravo!
B007VPLNGW|5.0|really like this game as you have to use your brain to work through it I get very frustrated with it some times but that's part of the fun.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|If you're a musical lover, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!  Stellar cast, and fresh, ingenue faces.  Incredible!  Don't miss it!
B00B9B4IYI|4.0|Sounds great and easy to use! Works great with my phone and tablet, but when I use my laptop, the music skips.
B003R17BV0|5.0|True story and enjoyable to watch whether you're a golfer or not. Family friendly and and inspirational and follows book rather well although a love angle is artificially yet positively added.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best writing for television period. Complex characters, compelling drama, high production values. Maggie Smith alone is reason enough to watch.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I'm not much of a book reviewer. I liked this story because it was easy to read, yet detailed and descriptive at the same time. I set my Kindle up with large print, then &#34;speed read&#34; through these exciting books.<br />  This was my first Jack Reacher story, but it won't be my last. I like to read these one after another; often later stories explain details of action or character that may be puzzling at first. If you like exciting detective stories, you'll like this one and will probably become a Jack Reacher fan like me.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love this game!!!  It is such a challenge for me.  I play this game more than I do my other games.  It is very exciting, especially when I think I am almost winning.  I have to concentrate on the tiles and where their positions are to beat the game.  I have won several times. My daughter-in-law suggested I get this game,  She plays it all the time.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Michael Bolton does all the classics from the Hitsville era justice.  The songs were great back then and Michael sings his own renditiion of them in the same vein as they were originally done although you know it's not the original artist.  It's a very enjoyable compilation of songs - the ones we all can recognize.  Good job!
B002T4GXSS|1.0|The Movie Was Good But I Hated it for it was only one disc and I did not have the other to finish the movie. I wrote about it and never received the other disc and I'm not happy at all about it would please like the whole movie that I paid for thank you.
B003HKN52U|5.0|I had this in vhs and now have it in dvd.  I have always loved this movie in any form.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Great graphics. Just getting started so far so good. A little confusing not knowing what to find in the scenes.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I would rather have the game itself!!! Thought I could download the game on my Kindle Fire HD but I guess not :(
B00ET47USI|5.0|este es otro de mis juegos es entretenido y facil,mantienes a tu mente ocupada,y no te aburres lo recomiendo  tambien.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I just loved watching the first season of &#34;Suits&#34; and couldn't stop watching the episodes.  Very engaging with very sharp dialogue.  A must see TV show!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not going to read the Fifty Shades Trilogy but one of my friends asked if I read it and I said &#34;no, that I had heard many mixed reviews on it and decided not to read it&#34;.  She said it's a great book!!  She had already read the trilogy.  Her taste in books is eclectic, as are mine.  So I decided to read just the first one, if I liked it then I'd get the other two.  I love it!  Despite the obvious of it being very graphic, the characters are complicated, at times funny, interesting and there is much more to them then just sex.  I'm almost finished with the book and I can't wait to see what the second and third book are all about.  These books are not for everyone.  An open mind is good to have when reading something like this.  One has to wonder why Christian is the way he is and why Ana accepts it all, can't wait to read the other two and hopefully find out the reasons behind their lifestyle.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great cable show with no commercials and very interesting cast members.  I was hooked as soon as I started watching it.  This is what network tv should be like.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So many options. From Auto dismiss, to how to snooze, to how to shut, make this the BEST alarm clock
B00B5P37IG|1.0|was looking for something that had local stations. if you are religious this would fill your need. will keep looking for the right thing.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I had bought my copy of the Blu from Best Buy the day of release. I have since exchanged it twice. The picture has these snow storm like images and noise lines much like a VHS. Now when watched on the DVD these are not noticeable or even in the HD broadcast from Epix. Yes there are artistically used filters and grain but the blu is so extreme and different this can not be right? NOw as for the sound. My system shows the 5.1 as decoding right but there is little to no sound from any of the right channels and faintly from center. I am familiar with how 5.1 works and own plenty of Blu ray movies with no issue. In fact I bought the Star Trek blu same day Beautiful surround sound, so why is the MDNA blu so messed up? There are three options for audio if you play option 2 it is a two channel and has issues if you go to option 3 also two channel, that seems to work. However I paid premium for Blu ray and that means great picture and surround sound. If this is the quality I should have paid .50 cents for a VHS tape. The kicker is that Best Buy will not acknowledge these issue and treat me as if I am crazy. Fans have been contacting Universal, interscope , and tweeting @guyoseary with the same issues but NO one will acknowledge it or some stores will not allow refunds. So Buyer BEWARE! Again this is based on technical qualities not artistic filters and editing. I had the opportunity to see the show in person twice and it was amazing, unfortunate that this issue is tainting Madonna's legacy of perfection and the silence on the issue is disheartening.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|l love it u can buy all of the my little pony's get the game<br /><br />it is a great game
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The best for the price. Audio Technica is a great product. This mic is can be used directly plugged into my canon or into my wireless transmitter. Great for interviews.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I saw this movie pop up as Amazon Instant Video's most popular movie, and I had wanted to see it, so I decided to watch it. Glad that I did. I'm just going to give a quick synopsis that doesn't give anything away!<br /><br />In the future, Boston to D.C. has merged to one city, Mega City One. Judges are essentially cops, judges, juries, and sometimes executioners all in one. A crime is committed in a building, and Dredd and his trainee go to investigate. What looked like a routine investigation turns into a battle for Dredd and his trainee as they try to escape the building.<br /><br />If you're looking for something deep, this isn't the movie for you. If you're just looking for some action and a well made film, then you should definitely give Dredd a try.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is great.  I enjoy the challenge.  Good game. Give it a try.  You will like it.  Like I said, it's great.
B008J05EL8|2.0|Not used because I do very little typing on my Kindle.  This is only useful if you are downloading officew stuff with a vvariety of fonts.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Starting up or working on an existing business to make it better? Either way, you will find useful ideas and information in this book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've been quoting it for weeks now like some crazed fanatic. Funniest book I've read in years. I'm looking forward to listening to the audio version. Tina Fey is brilliant.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can hardly stand to wait for season 4! I hated the ending of season 3  but look forward to season 4.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little girl loves this game!  She always wants to play the horsey game when she gets her kindle!  There are a lot of pop up ads, but we can just click off of them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It keeps your attention. You get so involved with the cast, Can't wait for season 4!!! You find yourself in a different time in life.
1250029465|5.0|It's one of the most inspirational stories I've read, all the more so because it's true.  James, a drug addict whose recovery is iffy, and a cat whose injuries put his survival in doubt almost miraculously find each other and build a friendship that saves both.  Bob is a remarkable cat in his devotion to his rescuer and through the association lifts James out of his precarious hand to mouth existence as a street musician.<br /><br />As a life-long cat person, Bob has to be one of the most unique cats ever.  He makes our two rescue cats look like pre-school (kitten-garten) drop-outs.  They're good cats and we love them but still, they're sure no Bob!  Rumor has it the book may be turned into a movie.  A tough assignment to find cat actors to portray Bob.  One can only hope they do the book justice.  It's a must read for cat people and anyone else who likes an uplifting story.
B00003CXAA|5.0|It's so nice to have this masterpiece , uncut ,no commercial interruptions, at our finger-tips. It is the real deal! Thank you!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This documentary was very informative and educational. It provided good insight and helped me to reflect on my food choices.
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|I have never seen anything like this and found it really easy to use.<br />I will be using it a lot.
034580404X|5.0|I will have to say that, yes, at first I did like I would like this triology like so many others out there. So, one day I bought the triology. I sat down and opened the first book and I did not put it down until I finished it. I actually read all day and night to the next morning before I would make myself put it down. I think that with this book you have to allow your mind to take an adventure because is what it did for. I love my husband and this book was not replacing anything that lacks in my life. I think that it is the best book I have read in years, so much so that I am reading it again. I was only able to stay away from it for like 4 to 5 days (if that) and I had to read it again just because I liked it that much. I do agree with most people you have to have an open mind, but you have to have the ability to be confortable in your own sexuality to get through the sex in these books. There ready is not anything in that book that we do not know about already. This was better than 8mm the movie, now that is the worst way to try and think about sex and what people dream of doing to another person to do them selves for to some one else. I will continue to read this book it is great, I love the characters.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was one of the first Kindle games I bought, and I wish it was available in a PC version.  The graphics are awesome, beautiful, and the game is challenging, but not too difficult.  I get a bit lost in remembering how to get back to certain places but that is not a fault of the game but of the gamer.  I haven't finished it yet because I will be sad when I do, so am playing it slowly to savor every minute.  I think you will like this game.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Funny movie. Great way to spend time with family and enjoy a laugh or two. Michael Kenton does a great job.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I liked the Kindle \version of this enough to turn around and buy the PC version so I could play it on a larger screen and at home.  It is a different sort of match three game and can be a little time consuming as it can take a while to get through a level.  The more &#34;cash&#34; you earn as you play the more helps you get in clearing the board and the more expensive they get (we are not talking real money here, just the Monopoly sort).  It does take some thought as you play and you can manipulate the matches to help you clear a tough section so it isn't just the usual mind-numbing match three that you find with other games of this sort.  Play the demo version first, then decide.
B002L5KL5G|3.0|Unable to see more that 40 minutes of the film, rest was digital garbage, had to rent non HD version to see movie. Great flick with period sound track. Characters well portrayed. A number of lessons which we should all learn.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have been playing mahjong now for several years and have several different versions.  My biggest complaint about this one is for an experienced player the layouts are not much of a challenge.  If you are new to the game then it holds just enough challenge to not bore you, but experienced players, I would look further.
B00003CXRM|5.0|never thought i enjoy a box full of hillbillies , but surprise surprise and a few shazzams. Didn't know what i was missing.ENJOY Georges best.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Very interesting game.  It is challenging without being completely hair-tearing frustrating, BUT is much too short.  There are only ten levels and even the slowest player can get through this in a couple of hours.  The manufacturer has promised more levels &#34;soon&#34; whatever ''soon&#34; may be.  I think you will like it if you like puzzles, but it will end way too soon.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|never see his face keeps mask on his chin resembles stalone,guess that was the idea.and u must like blood !!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I have the PC edition of this game which I have played more times than I can count and never get bored with it.  This android/Kindle version is just like the original.  If you have played the PC version then I would highly recommend the Kindle version.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Gripping and complex drama. Great acting, superb videography and wickedly intricate plot are all combined with occasional moments of wry humor despite the chilling central theme.
1575666286|5.0|This is the same review I gave to &#34;Healing, The Gerson Way&#34; :I have studied several other nutritional therapies. This one makes a lot of sense both physiologically and chemically based on my limited and unprofessional life experience. It also dovetails with most of the others but offers much more explanation and elucidation of the practice of different components of the therapy. After 80 years of use and considering thousands of successful treatment regimes how can one argue with it, weather or not the AMA approves or not. My wife is a cancer survivor. If her cancer returns, we are going to the Gerson clinic for three weeks and then we are living by Dr. Max's rules.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|great movie with great lessons.  I would recommend it for all families with kids.  Even adults would love it. and it is so nice to have movies that we actually can watch and love.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Another great read from Follett - I really like the way he entwines historical events with fiction - I will be buying Winter of the World ...
B007P3TMW2|4.0|Losing a parent is not easy, but losing one to a senseless act of terrorism is even worse as this film portrays. A real tear jerker.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Just couldn't stop. Gripping story that reaches all emotions. Surprises that truly surprised !!!on to book 3 tonight! Thank you
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Good writing, funny and of course answers the question, &#34;What's up with all the redshirts dying?&#34; This is a great book whether you're a sci-fi fan or not because it's just a great story.
0761158820|5.0|I purchased this as an activity teenagers could engage in during down time in our summer camp and they actually seemed to enjoy working their way through them. There are a few that were indeed hard as they required a very steady and gentle hand but overall a great book. Having blank templates at the back of the book was a nice touch as the children had a chance to design their own monster.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addicting, so much fun.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.  Challenging with lots of levels
B00EVVAXQU|4.0|When I was a little kid the family would rejoice in unison at a new Beatles album which would be played to death. Even Mom enjoyed them! Are you kidding? We were witness to some of the greatest music in history fresh on record blaring from the console stereo. SO...today in 2013 a new Macca record on the horizon. A man who has been in our family for many years like a relative that always brings cheer and lots of love when he visits. \\"New\\" has a Sgt. Pepper sound to it, upbeat and catchy. Just what the doctor ordered. Here I am a old man now still rejoicing when a new tune comes along from those dreadful Beatles!
B00F35BV64|4.0|This movie was really good and I'll probably purchase it at some point. However, I do believe that the first film was better.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fast paced. Insightful to the human experience. Author knows how to weave a story better than most. A must read for all middle aged women.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Best.Show.Ever.<br /><br />Six Seasons and a Movie!<br /><br />Watch its you definitely will not regret it. It's smart, funny, and ridiculous all rolled into one neat, well written package.
B007T9FRFS|5.0|love how Kathy brings the story to life, makes you really feel these are real people. Love all the Tempe books
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The original cable that came with my Kindle was, from day one, a struggle to insert into the port to charge it. I finally called for some help and the person I spoke with was very helpful and arranged for me to receive a new cable at no cost which I greatly appreciated since it was apparently a manufacturing issue.  I received the new cable within a couple of days and it can be inserted into the port with NO struggle.  It is a pleasure to try to charge my Kindle now that I don't have to struggle with the cable.<br />Thank you.<br />Lucy Kemp
B000SEI230|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books. He is a awesome writer and I would read anything he writes. Which I have, lol! Made me cry....
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|This drama is absolutely riveting! You are held so tight by the story that you can't wait for the next episode.<br />David Tennant really shows his acting chops in the role of D.I. Hardy. For those who have only known him as the Tenth Doctor Who, you will either love it or hate it depending on your grip on reality. Olivia Coleman's Detective Sargeant Ellie Miller is a mother, a wife and a small town detective. Her life, as well as the rest of the town, is turned upside down by the events in this series. Her abilities are stretched to the limit and beyond by this real crime and tragedy in her community.<br />Great acting all round. Gripping story. A must see.

B00EP2PXCY|5.0|I'll admit, when I first saw Ariana Grande, I didn't give her music much thought, as I assumed she would be like many other young stars, with little to offer in the way of talent.  I'm happy to say that I was completely wrong in my assumption of Ariana.  Someone pressured me to watch a performance of \\"Almost is Never Enough\\", and I was absolutely smitten by Ariana's skill.  Grande has a versatile, four octave voice that navigates through the album nicely, from the elegant opening of \\"Honeymoon Avenue\\", all the way through the party beat of \\"Better Left Unsaid\\".  I never buy albums, but for Ariana, I happily made an exception.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse almost worked for me. However after several weeks I put in on a shelf as a backup along with my other \\"backups\\" .<br />That shelf is getting crowded!<br /><br />First off the mouse itself is great. I liked the feel of it and for the most part the buttons are positioned quite well.<br />The problem I had with it is it just does not fit my grip style which is unorthodox to say the least.<br /><br />So my search continues for a replacement for my ancient but still working MS Sidewinder.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|The film will dazzle you and fool you. It accomplishes something you won't see coming, as what seems like an anti-date movie becomes one of the best love stories you'll see for years. And one of the best comedies, too.
B0064MGU98|5.0|It is a very good drama. The stories are separated from each other but still have a clue of actors personal life gone through. The languages are so sharp and logical.
B007STBUIW|5.0|JAWS needs only to be made to look better and sound better, as this Blu-ray version manages to be even better than the 25th anniversary DVD. Refined - but never remade. It's on a list of untouchables that includes Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Lawrence Of Arabia - and amazingly enough, Hollywood has kept its respect for the film and Steven Spielberg - who got vaulted up to the greatest of heights after this, and has a place on Hollywood's Mount Rushmore to this day - and has never considered remaking it (Sequels? That's another issue...) This is the film that inspired fear of sharks, and the ocean, like no other film since - but also fascination. Sharks get more study and protection now thanks to this film, though there was a period of ignorant killing of them after the film's first release. It's the story of abnormal shark behaviour (this is important to remember, for the critics who question it - the inspiration for the story coming from the famous Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916) as a monstrous great white shark comes to the beaches of Amity Island and refuses to leave. Killing several random bathers, the dramatic stakes get constantly raised as the town gets divided over the best response, with the Chief of Police (Roy Scheider, in his best everyman mold) championing public safety by closing the beaches vs. the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) championing tourist dollars and the town's economy coming first. It all comes to a head in the last act, as the Chief and two shark experts hunt the shark at sea and have a confrontation every bit as epic as Moby Dick. It's a adventure ride that hooked me as a young man and never let me go.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|Some really interesting case studies in this book, I highly recommend it, especially for people who like to know why people do the things they do.
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World sits on a small list. It's a list of big budget, American financed (meaning, Hollywood backed) films where Toronto, Canada - one of their favourite stand-in-for-anywhere shooting locations - ACTUALLY PLAYS ITSELF. Who else is on that list? - Strange Brew, the Fly, Chloe, Fly Away Home etc. - it's not very long. Canada playing itself in a Hollywood feature isn't that long a list either (some X-Men movies, The Whole Nine Yards, The Score, The Shipping News etc.) I wasn't actually familiar with the zany, anime-style indie comic series the film comes from beforehand. So in brief: it's a wildly energetic, surreal look at young hipsters in Toronto, where battle of the bands at concert venues can become gladiatorial combat. The movie has the same interior logic of film musicals, but instead of breaking out into song when the emotion gets too high, the films breaks out into video game-like battles to the death, where the losers shatter into a shower of coins, and extras lives get awarded for reaching high enough levels of personal maturity!<br /><br />This is the journey 22 year old Canadian rock bassist Scott Pilgrim finds himself on, as to date the woman of his dreams - recent American import Ramona Flowers - he must first defeat her seven evil exes for the right to her hand. Heavy baggage is what Ramona carries; yet Scott also comes to realize he has baggage of his own to deal with, and must find that next level of his game as he now realizes THAT is the key to true happiness. A game changer and runaway winner by director Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz.)

B000OONQ9O|5.0|After renting the DVD version of the Ultimate Director's Cut first, I was concerned about the audio on the Blu-ray version. It sounded flatter, more mono like in the early crowd scenes, where I expected more surround sound(they couldn't possibly have two different audio versions?) - I eventually found I just had to turn the dials up more for the Blu-ray, and it matched. Flawless picture quality for a 1979 release; doesn't look dated at all. I remember just the poster for this in the theatre lobby intimating me as a 9-year in 1979; it was a time when urban crime and gangs were prevalent in the public's mind (it was the same era that gave us the Deathwish films, which gave the audience the revenge it craved for feeling intimated by criminals and gangs.) Only in the last few years did I understand the story was inspired by some famous Greek history - Anibasis by Xenophon, the famous retreat of Greek soldiers from deep in the Persian Empire - updated to a dystopian, future New York where gang culture has actually become a true alternative to a society with corrupt police and government officials (plus the influence of different mafia families.) One gang on a long retreat from a meeting in the Bronx - The Warriors, from Coney Island - are on a journey of both body and spirit, ultimately asking themselves is such a life worth it, and is there more beyond the horizon of the city they have always felt trapped in. A film both thrilling and unexpectedly thought provoking, and still the best film to date by Walter Hill (48 hrs. , Red Heat, Streets Of Fire)
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Awesome fun and scary too.  classic horror.  I am a big horror movie fan and i havent seen one like this in a while.  thank you.  its almost refreshing.

B00C2VIA52|4.0|awesome game with great graphics. force closed on me a couple times but has been great since. Was fine after I restarted my kindle.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I honestly don't really know what to title this without sounding too crummy or stupid, but this game is just...amazing.<br /><br />I actually learned of the series earlier last year, and got to watching the anime before getting the game (I hadn't had enough money on me to actually get my hands on this or a Vita) and I absolutely fell in love. The characters, setting, and flow of story got me hooked. So much, in fact, that I absolutely resolved to get the game so I could truly experience it (I mean, the anime's just an attempt to capture the major elements of the game). So yes, I bought a Vita purely for this game because that's how fantastic this game is. Most games don't drive you to buy a new console just to play it, but this one does.<br /><br />So far I've gotten through three weeks' worth in the game calendar and spent 16 (yes, 16) hours. And I'm not even going to complain about how long the grinding in the dungeons took, because I genuinely enjoyed fighting all the shadows (it did get a bit repetitive but the battles are actually fun!). Unfortunately I think I might be taking a little longer than most at leveling up because this is one of the first times I've actually played an rpg game seriously (the other times I lost interest early in the game or was simply playing at a friend's house), but the fact that the dungeon battles are actually /fun/ is great in its own right. So gameplay-wise as of now is fantastic, and I'm normally the type to get sick of dungeons fast. I think the possibilities of using different Personas and tactics/strategies really helps make the battles more interesting, since it provides variety and different results, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Character-wise: I cannot get enough of the characters. I've already seen handfuls of screencaps with humorous or unbelievable dialogue, but actually experiencing it firsthand is so much more entertaining and meaningful, I think. Multiple times I've actually set down my Vita and laughed for a solid 10 seconds just because of the ridiculous dialogue or things you can make your character say. For example, while checking the fridge at home, I had my character eat expired miso soup (which happened to increase my courage). Of course, the things you can make yourself consume (be it dirt/grass science projects or yogurt-turned milk) is a whole nother story as it's a minor activity in the game yet still one of the most memorable parts.<br />But yes, the characters are so unique and well-developed in Persona 4 that I love each and every one of them, as they all have a shining aspect to them. I found myself caring for some characters I didn't like in the beginning, because they accepted their flaws and were just so realistic and human (I will admit I don't like maybe three characters for fair reasons, but some of them are actually extremely complex and interesting to analyze). The characters really drive this game home, I think.<br /><br />Gameplay outside of battles is quite fun, too. I'll admit the graphics aren't that great (sometimes very unflattering) but everything else makes up for it. I suppose it's a bit of a hassle to balance out what you want to do each day (from part-time jobs, social links, fusing personas, saving up on money or rather choosing what to buy, raising stats) but luckily there are plenty of days for you to space things out. Another thing is that even if you aren't familiar with how to play, adjusting comes extremely easily and just 30 minutes in you've gotten a feel for it.<br /><br />The voice acting is superb, as well. Personally I think Kanji and Yosuke's voices fit perfectly (even more than the original Japanese version, and I never give that kind of opinion out, ever), but in all honestly everyone sounds right. There aren't any weird \\"this voice really doesn't fit this character\\" kind of vibes you get when you play. I was a bit iffy about Dojima's voice but it's already grown on me, and it's only been a couple of weeks in the game (in real time, just maybe 4 hours in).<br /><br />The background music is a little strange for most people I'd believe, since the vast majority of them are catchy and sung in accented English (so it doesn't even sound like English most of the time). I was weirded out when I first started playing but now it just seems to fit in perfectly. The other tracks, however, like Smile (plays during some social link scenes), dungeon music, Dream Melody (usually during more emotional scenes), and I'll Face Myself (after defeating shadow bosses normally) are great; they're actually some of my personal favorite songs out of my whole music library now.<br /><br />Anything else....nope, that's about it. This game is highly engrossing and you can literally find yourself playing for 8+ hours straight in one sitting. And you'll probably end up constantly having an itch to play whenever you have free time. At least, I did.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Few films reach this kind of poignancy.  Set, style, and design all take us to the 1960s but the story captures the ageless loss of a loved one and manages to do it without gratuitous sex scenes.  What is assumed never happens and the final resolve is both shocking and brilliant.  After leaving the theatre I had to sit down again.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Love all of Chris Knights music. His songs actually tell a story and mean something. Unlike most of the crap that comes out of Nashville these days.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|One of my top ten movies of all time.  An intriguing story with definitely the finest performance of Steve McQueen's<br />career, and one of the best ever by Dustin Hoffman, but such an unusual role that I think most critics have<br />overlooked it.  An adventure story, but ultimately a story of deep friendship.
0670026638|5.0|Time, our place in time and our place within a social structure are focused on in Ruth Ozeki's Man Booker Prize shortlisted novel, A Tale for the Time Being. What gives the novel its philosophical foundation are the beliefs of its author, who is a Buddhist priest.<br /><br />This foundation also provides an emotional and moral center to the tales of three women, what they believe and the love they feel that is grounded in their beliefs.  Throw in quantum physics, Schrodinger's cat and folklore about crows, and the result is a heavyweight novel that is easy to absorb  and worthy of contemplation.<br /><br />Ruth is the present-day narrator who  shares with her author creator being a writer and a Buddhist priest living in British Columbia. The fictional Ruth and her husband live in a small village on a sound, where the ocean waves still manage to deliver a package. It at first appears to be a copy of the Proust novel À la recherche du temps perdu saved in plastic.<br /><br />It is instead a journal remade with the novel's cover, a journal written by a teenage girl in Japan around the turn of the 21st century.  Nao was raised in Silicon Valley when her father went to work there, but the bursting of the dot com bubble sent the family back to Japan. She is the epitome of a stranger living in a strange land.  She isn't fluent in Japanese. She's behind in school. And she is bullied. The bullying is relentless and  harrowing. Her classmates even hold a fake funeral for her and put it on the internet.<br /><br />Without consulting her, her parents decide to send her for the summer break to her great-grandmother Jiko, a 104-year-old Buddhist nun in a remote mountain location. This nun is the kind of fictional character who should exist in real life. She's a spiritual Auntie Mame who helped form some of Nao's father's best memories as a boy and is showing, not telling, her great-granddaughter the power of zazen, a method of meditation. She also hopes Nao develops a superpower.<br /><br />Ruth could use the power of meditation. She's been trying to write a memoir of her mother, who died several years ago after suffering from Alzheimer's, but has been stalled for ages. As a writer, she knows this is not healthy:<br /><br />An unfinished book, left unattended, turns feral, and she would need all her focus, will, and ruthless determination to tame it again.<br /><br />Instead of her own work, Ruth is captivated by Nao and worries about her, even though the journal was written years ago. It may have reached Canada in the vanguard of debris drifting over after the tsunami and Fuskushima disaster, which is ongoing.<br /><br />Ruth doesn't even know if Nao is still alive. She not only wrote about killing herself, her father is sinking into depression ever more deeply because he cannot find work after they return to Japan. He isn't even successful at killing himself. He does roam the streets at night, and sometimes Nao follows him. These sections are highly reminiscent of Murakami's writing, especially in 1Q84 during night sessions involving a playground swing in the middle of a metropolis. Ruth also is having a hard time finding evidence online that Nao is real.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Nao plans to write a biography of Jiko but like Ruth, she gets off-track and the work is not done. Jiko admires early Japanese feminists, and may or may not have written an \\"I-novel\\", an early form of Japanese confessional fiction. Is this what Nao's journal is? She is deliberately reaching out to someone who will one day read what she has written:<br /><br />Maybe when I ask you a question like \\"You doing okay?\\" you should just tell me, even if I can't hear you, and then I'll just sit here and imagine what you might say. You might say, \\"Sure thing, Nao. I'm okay. I'm doin' just fine.\\"<br /><br />Is she practicing I-fiction or trying to find someone, anyone, since her new life is so desolate?<br /><br />While Nao's father is trying to commit suicide, the reader also learns about Jiko's son. He was a kamikaze pilot during World War II. But he also was a scholar, a lover of French literature and poetry. Writings of his also surface.<br /><br />Perhaps it is inevitable, but there is an element of the fantastical toward the end of the novel before Ozeki brings everything back together. I can't say much without going into spoilers but again, it felt like wandering into Murakami territory and it felt right.<br /><br />Ozeki weaves in ideas about bullies, both personal and corporate, sustainability, old growth and how to live at peace in the multiple POV narrative that doesn't feel forced. There is ultimately a calmness that the writing delivers, and it has to do with realizing how connected we all are.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|With Fiio's commitment to quality at low costs, the new X3 is worth every penny. With a 64gb micro sd card it holds almost all my music. The line out and coax out are great for my stereo connections. With the support to do 196/24 audio, I guess it's time to re-rip my collection.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is one of those productions that has merit on many levels:  plot, acting, directing. writing cinematography, editing,etc.  Everyone should see it, at least, twice!

B001AITGWE|5.0|I started to write: File this movie under the \\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore\\" category, but see that has already been done! If you're a fan of the Charles Bronson series of movies, like \\"Death Wish\\", \\"Falling Down\\" is a movie that tells the ugly of the other side - perhaps with good reason or maybe not - but it's introduced, nonetheless. Bad guys get punished, but in the end, it takes two to tango. Leaves one wondering who was right and who wrong? Probably neither.  I'm wondering if Michael Douglas had fun with this movie? One of my all-time movie favorites:)
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I buy Blue Ray + DVD to get special features but thanks to Paramount I should have skipped this until the second release.<br />You want a bonus features like deleted scenes?

B00CATSONE|3.0|This book gave me a quick review of Nikola Tesla' s life.

B00821OX98|4.0|It is a modern, more high tech version of many TV series like V in the '80s.  The plot and storyline are interesting but sometimes they have strange leaps and jumps in logic and direction.  It is apparent they either have different writers or are playing to survey results and ratings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is crazy fun and it is like crack for kids it is very entertaining and addictive and it never gets old.
1616614609|2.0|I recognize a *lot* of people love this game. So I kept trying to learn to like it. But in the end, I just don't get the appeal. I suspect (but have no evidence) that people who like this game also like Magic The Gathering, a game I never played. There are similar game mechanics here, so perhaps that is part of the appeal for those who like it.<br /><br />Problems:<br />First, the game is very complicated. To me, that's an upside -- it means the game has the potential to be very interesting. The problem is that the rule book is absolutely terrible. You simply cannot learn to play this game without consulting many different online videos, fan-made rule books, or forums that discuss the rules. The rule book is horribly organized and neither walks you through learning the game in a logically progressive way nor serves an adequate reference book when you have questions. I'd rather do my taxes than deal with the rule book for this game.<br /><br />Second, the base game has decks (identities) and functions that are nearly worthless. Perhaps these identities & functions make sense when mixed with expansions for the game (which I never bought), but if that's true, then the base game should include those expansions from the get go.<br /><br />Third, and this may be an intrinsic problem with deck building games of this type, players can win or lose very quickly depending on luck of the draw (especially early in the game). Yes, there's skill in building a smart deck (once you have the expansions to make many cards/identities in the base game actually worth something) and yes, once you play many games, better players will more often win. But if you just want to sit down and play one or two games with someone, it can easily feel like the major points are won/lost by luck of the draw. And that's just unacceptable for a good game.<br /><br />For my money, deck building games like Dominion are leaps and bounds better than Android: Netrunner.

B000URWYTS|4.0|This novel was a fictitious account of the love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick, one of his clients wives. The story is interesting in that the Woman Movement had just begun and women were still treated as possessions, not people in their own right who could make decisions for themselves. It recounts the sacrifices necessary to carry on this affair in a time when women did not have personal freedoms, even though the life Mamah led was one of privilege in both relationships. The historical facts about the time period and the norm in relationships at that time made for thought provoking reading. The ending was fast moving and was foreshadowed very little making it exciting and totally unexpected.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I love the group One Republic and this CD! Instead of empty headed pop music, One Republic performs intricate, intelligent compositions that make you think about what message they are trying convey through the words in each song.<br />The instrumentation sets the mood and the lyrics are expressed with feeling and emotion. Each CD cut has a unique sound, not cookie cutter repetition. If you are missing this CD from your One Republic collection, get it!

159463176X|3.0|I would call Hosseini more of a storyteller than a novelist, and this book strings a series of episodes with a meandering narrative thread that justifies putting them together, but doesn't really constitute an overarching novelistic insight or development. Still, the individual stories are engaging, well-wrought.

B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is one of my top 3 family movies. The story is sweet. The characters are silly. You can even get up and do a bit of dancing. It's fun for all!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I saw this on the stage and wanted to be able to see it again, so I could understand what I had missed.  This is a great vehicle.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Never saw the &#34;amazing&#34; dance (or have any clue to how she sucked her cohorts into her surreal fantasies)<br />The transition between mental hospital and the club was broken (how'd he instantly grow a mustache?)<br />The ending tried to give meaning to the whole charade but the message seemed hollow since no one who wanted to suceed did so. The plot was sound but the story was too convoluted and lacked flow. Not sure if the bad acting was wholly the director's fault or if that was the best they could do.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The writing is terrible.  1/4 through the book and so bad I stopped reading it.  Too many characters all over the place.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked it a lot. The lightning thief kept me reading it the entire time.<br />I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends.<br />I gave it five stars because it deserved however I didn't like the movie at all.<br />I can't wait for more of Percy Jackson!!!!!
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I've seen a LOT of music documentaries, and this is probably the best one ever.  It's a fascinating story, and in spots truly heartbreaking, too.  But what is really special about this film is that it just *exudes* the joy that comes from getting to make music with other human beings.  It's Dave Grohl's love note not just to this iconic studio and that Neve console, but to music in general.  In that regard it succeeds 110%, and leaves one elated and inspired at the end.  I've seen this film twice now, and I know it's one that I will watch many more times - and love it just as much each and every time.  It's simply perfect.  Thank you for this labor of love, Dave.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|Handy app. Would be better if when something is deleted it would completely be taken off not just grayed out. Causes clutter in a small space.
0898159156|5.0|It was recommended to me a few years ago by a serious website on various bog and carnivorous plants. I asked them for a good book as I had had fair to poor luck over years (including setting up peat bog terrariums that were watered with distilled water....) and managed to keep something alive for about 8 months.  I finally bought the book and it was well worth it. If you truly want to keep pitchers, sundews and trap plants; this is a good reference. I don't like wasting $ on print reference so if I give it 5 stars it was worth my money.  Hopefully in the spring I will be set up to adopt some specimens and be able to keep them healthy and happy this time.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Saw this on TV the other night and had to buy it for my father, who is a musician and recording engineer. He loves his work but it can also be work sometimes. This, I think, will rekindle some passion for what he does when he's recording yet another terrible musician.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is amazing. I love it. I misse most of season 2 but that to amazon got to watch it easily!!
B00AECGQF2|2.0|I downloaded this because it was free for the granddaughter, and I am glad I did.  She loves this game as she has choices and can change the characters as she plays.  The only thing she did not like we're the characters verbal expressions, but she discovered the volume control, so she plays the game with silence on the Kindle.
0307895505|5.0|Mindblowingly skyrim-esque awesome.  Not really much more I can say.  If you like skyrim, you'll love this.  A must have
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I saw it in the theater and it is still a great movie. True to the series - the tradition lives on!
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Update:Will not run on anything except a kindle tablet. When I (and I assume most of the negative reviewers) purchased this it was NOT listed as a \\"Kindle Tablet Edition\\". Nearly three weeks later the description is stealth changed. I'm leaving this as a negative review because that is some shady business.
B0051T46XM|4.0|This is played as if it were found footage from a student journalistic report on bear poachers in Norway. However, it turns out that the unusual activity actually concerns keeping the troll population under control and in their allowed areas. I really loved the character of the Troll Hunter himself - He seemingly has the worst job in the world and does it because &#34;somebody has to do it.&#34;<br /><br />I loved the varieties of trolls in the film - Seemingly impossible and yet like the legends!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Norway's wild and rural areas - Very beautiful!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup went well for multiple devices (Nexus 7, windows 7 laptop, Droid Bionic) still trying to get it working with Kindle Fire. Otherwise a nice piece of tech.  Would recommend to others.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|First the good: this game has nice graphics and music. The theme to Ancient City is nice and relaxing but doesn't feel out of place in a racing game.<br /><br />If you press &quot;Setup&quot; on the track select screen, you can select your speed, number of opponents, and opponent's speed.<br /><br />Now for the bad: the controls. The steering is way too sensitive, which makes it very difficult to keep the car on the road. Hopefully, the developer will fix this, since it ruins an otherwise promising game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love all the series they are so good. Can't wait for the next to come out. Would recommended to anyone wanting to see true characters.
B00051E906|5.0|THIS METER IS EASY TO USE AND VERY SENSITIVE AND CAN DETECT CONTAMINATED FOOD FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  THE JAPANESE POWER PLANT  IS POLLUTING EVERYTHING.  I CHECK ALL MY FOOD AND DID FIND SOME SALMON AT LOCAL FISH MARKET WITH A LOW LEVEL OF RADIATION ABOVE OUR LOCAL BACKGROUND.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Its a weaker plot than most Star Trek movies. I didn't like how the actors were used. I didnt like the rushed feeling the story had, and they DOWN PLAYED KHAN. HOW DO YOU DOWNPLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF THE MOVIES/SERIES. HOW. WELL!! THEY DID! THEY DOWN PLAYED HIM. UGGGHHHHH, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER! But yeah, its good for a rent, just rent it. Loved the first one I did.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Been playing many of g5e's game's for a while now. This one is hands down my favorite!!! Highly recommend it!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wish I would have signed up a long time ago!  I cannot believe the awesome ideas people have.  Love the recipes, gift ideas, craft ideas, etc.  I cannot wait to explore all of the categories!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is pretty fun it has a lot of options and quests to do and it is challenging in a fun way
B000MR2OCI|5.0|on this compact muscular little leopard. Intriguing as this is hand painted. I really like the teeth! The pose sets it apart from the other cats in the collection. A great gift for the young or young at heart.
1401235425|1.0|In an attempt to understand people's interest in the new 52, I decided to give Snyder's Batman run a shot since his had the most hype. And it was no surprise to me that the work was just terrible. I'm not speaking strictly in relation to Batman, but comics in general. I've read a great deal of comics in my time, all sorts of types, but this one was a struggle to complete. Snyder writes Batman/Bruce as he writes any of the other characters in this abysmal and \\"critically acclaimed\\" run. The intellectual Batman speaks in run-on sentences with occasional errors in grammar, just as Dick Grayson does, and pretty much everyone else. Batman's vast and elegant vocabulary has been reduced to a teenager's idea of a high society billionaire. Snyder does very little to differentiate dialogue between characters, giving most of that burden to Capullo, who draws the young Batman almost identically to Dick Grayson. There is very little in character depth in this book. Apparently in the new 52, Batman is an arrogant, unsympathetic jackass who would sooner mistrust his own friends and family then have faith in them. In one scene [spoilers], Batman knows Dick has a symbol of the Court placed into one of his back molars. So instead of telling his adopted son, that he has cared for since he was a child and trained to fight by his side for years as Robin, he decides it is a better course of action to punch his son's tooth out. WHOA! How edgy! Batman is losing himself in the struggle to defeat the Court!! WHOA NELLY!! This, like most of the book, comes off as cheap and \\"macho\\", which Batman is neither. This scene relies on the reader's readiness to believe that Batman would be broken down this way as he desperately searched for answers in a very personal and heavy case. So prior to this scene, Snyder depicts Batman as arrogant, and brimming with bravado, providing a good backdrop for the eventual strike he gives his son. Some people would argue that this Batman is interesting because he is \\"vulnerable\\". But there is quite a difference between vulnerable, and weak. That is how this Batman comes off. His bloated attitude, his clumsy and often times bombastic way of investigating, his over reliance on technology, and his inability to see what's so obviously coming when he is warned again and again that there something in the shadows. But above all else, concerning this \\"modern\\" portrayal of Batman, nothing is more shameful than the damage done to his core. Thomas and Martha Wayne. First, [Spoilers] we see young Bruce mourning his murdered parents, swearing vengeance, not on crime, but on the Court of Owls, of whom he believes orchestrated their deaths. So, instead of Bruce's parents being murdered for no good reason by a no good hoodlum who was looking to make a quick buck, and swearing vengeance against crime itself for taking his parents, Bruce's parents were targeted by the Court and were killed for a reason. The Court exists outside the norm of city crime and violence, and therefore are almost completely fictitious, removing any sense of reality to the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Lives are taken every day by crime, not by a secret society of ninja owl people who are as every bit contrived as they sound. Second, reading over panels that depict Martha pregnant with a second child, a young Bruce playing with toys behind her, gave off a great deal of discomfort. The idea that they'd go to those lengths to tell a edgy and shocking Batman story seriously depressed me. Snyder shows no restraint in perverting Batman's origin. So all in all, this new Batman is edgy, but edgy for teenagers of whom the book is targeted for. He is a weak Batman, a Batman who is harmful to the vast mythos that precedes him. In accepting this Batman, we accept the death of his meaningful history, and bid farewell to the Caped Crusader that had swung from rooftop to rooftop since 1939. I will never say goodbye, but it would seem a whole generation disagrees with me.s \\"vulnerable\\". But there is quite a difference between vulnerable, and weak. That is how this Batman comes off.

B001HBYH9Q|5.0|It's a while since I've watched this movie so I'd forgotten quite how funny it was. The cheerful banter between all of the friends and the hilarious Spike is fantastic. The relationship between all of the characters is very endearing and makes them a very likable bunch. Plus some great camera shots...the seasonal change is very nicely done...note the pregnant lady at the beginning..... then she's holding a baby at the end. Loads of subtle looks and actions throughout that have you laughing and smiling the whole way through. Great movie.
B000J025AE|5.0|If you like thrillers and surprise, then you will love this movie. It stars Emmy Rossum and Kurt Russel! Great film.
0812973992|5.0|My son was assigned this book for summer reading.  He'd give it four stars which automatically makes it five stars for me - anything my kid actually enjoys reading is a winner.  However I actually read it myself and thought it was wonderful.  Don't even bother with the reviews, just read the darn thing.
B0043X8M0K|5.0|It wasn't cheap but I love Paul Wesley, Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder. Ian Somerhalder really makes the show. His character is very sensitive yet demonic! I would totally recommend this show if you love Vampires!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie. The book is even better! The movie was true to the book with small twists every now and then.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I'm not a gamer but I enjoy this simple race game to relax and pass some time.<br />It's worth getting.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Great visual sequences, thoughtful plot, and brief moments of acting keep this film from being a failure.  Poor scripting and dialogue, little development of the deeper philosophical themes from the graphic novel, and shallow characters will keep this film from doing any better than fading into the oblivion.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Action packed military flick. The Rock and Bruce Willis were great and there was plenty guns tanks swords and explosions for the biggest action nut
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS AMAZING PLZ GET ITS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD! I would suggest this to anybody. Although, the maker of minecraft is Notch, not mojang.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Great movie kept the family entertained.  It is one of those typical action movies not the best plot but was good. Entertaining
B00821PCJS|4.0|I like it....I am just getting into it but is is good.  Try it out and see what you like!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love listening to vintage speakers but I wanted to have a good pair of headphones for when the wife needs it quiet.  These work perfect and sound very good to my ears.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|While I love the movie and am very happy to finally own it, I am severely disappointed that there are absolutely NO EXTRAS.  Nothing on the making of, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, commentary....NOTHING.  Sometimes buying at places like Wal-Mart or Target only gets you the movie and no extras.  But I expected more from Amazon.  Heck, I could have bought this at a lower price elsewhere if I knew there was nothing but the movie.<br /><br />Happy with movie, disappointed with lack of extras.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book, even for a non-gamer type, easy to read, would recommend this to anyone that likes sci-fi stories. Also, it is full of 80's nostalgia.  I didn't know anything about this book when I choose it, and overall I am really satisfied with it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Well written, a haunting stir, I found that I could not put this one down....this is the best book of the series.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Good program for beginning player and more advanced alike.  You can adjust the level of play easily.  The peices are easy to move.  Good app.
B002N57KG2|5.0|I really loved the movie it brings back old memorys of my child hood. I will be getting the other movie as soon as I can
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch is another &#34;whodunit&#34; set in a GB coastal town.  Great acting, and everyone is a suspect.  Tension builds as, one by one, characters are eliminated either literally, or by investigation.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A great read.but finished up disliking both characters.they definitely deserved each other.still an unfinished story.they could not have a happy ending.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Good movie and great quality.  The digital copy was a little hard to set up on my smart blue ray player but i did get it done.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|It was great to revisit this treasure that I hadn't seen since I was a kid. Even better than I remembered it. Terrific writing, great acting and beautiful direction. A wonderful film.<br /><br />PS: Check out an unknown Paul Giamatti in the booth with Ed Harris, along with a guest appearance by Philip Glass. Those went over my head the first time.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|If you Love Doctor Who, then you will Love TorchWood. it is a very awesome show and I hope and can not wait for a season 5
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Very nice graphics and just challenging enough to make me want to do just one more race before putting it down. The controls are intuitive and it is easy to figure out.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The Seiko SNK805 is one terrific, inexpensive automatic watch with military styling that fulfills a watch's main function  ... to tell time! It is not as accurate, as a quartz watch that you can buy on Amazon for half the price, but it has soul, because it runs off of your body's motion! I've had this watch for about six months and it runs about a second slow a day, which is exceptional for an automatic watch that I paid less than $60 for. This particular model also comes in a series of three other colors, black - SNK809, blue - SNK807 and tan - SNK803. All of these models are very legible in low light situations, such as when you're watching TV in a darkened room. The movement found in the SNK805, the 7S26 is used in many Seiko automatic watches, many of which are a lot more expensive than the SNK805. This watch is also very lightweight and the band is comfortable. I wouldn't want to get the band wet, it would probably shrink somewhat! The lume on the hands and markers isn't very bright or long-lasting, but you're not going to get Seiko Monster illumination at this price! This is a great beater watch for young guys (or girls who don't like those \\"little princess\\" watches that you need a magnifying glass for, to tell time). It's also very good for older people who need to see what time it is without looking for their reading glasses first! Take reasonably good care of it and it will serve you for years. It's \\"cool\\" for not much money! I recommend it!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great Movie and it was safe for the kids to watch. It was suspenseful and dramatic and had a great twist at the end
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is AWESOME I recommend this to all minecraft players but one little thing I just got the app and it won't let me play on realms/servers I just want it to let play on the servers but overall AWESOME
B004UID2LC|1.0|it will only let me watch like 2 videos I tried a bunch aloft videos and they won't load!!! totally going to delete it.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|It is useless! At least on my kindle fire HD it is. You have to use the screen as the light and it is so dim it does not light up anything that is in front of you holding it.  I am sticking with the brightest flashlight app on my cell.  Now that is one bright light!
B00005IB57|5.0|I love the selections and performance by Claudio Arrau.  Well packaged.  Sent very rapidly.  Now i am inspired to work harder on some of the Nocturnes.  Carolyn
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It wasn't the best one that I've ever read, but it was far from awful. The book I'd so honest and heartfelt about the relationships between women forced together by their parts<br />. It is a perfect recounting of how unlikely kindnesses can get one through a tough and exhausting time, and Mrs. Kerman proves that life after prison can be a positive and successful time.<br /><br />I am left wondering about the lives of all the inmates that were do important to Piper. Did she ever find Jae? What happened with Pop? Did she and Natalie meet back up in the halfway house as promised? And Nora, was she ever spoken to again?
B009QU9X44|4.0|Chimamanda writes with a polished style which keeps you moving along at speed. Americanah does seem to be telling a true story of what it is like to be a student in a strange country, with little money and few friends, coping with sex and late adolescence. I have not finished it yet and perhaps further comments should be kept until I have.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I often am in hot spots and it becomes slow and sometimes even stops. So beware before purchasing this app.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I really enjoyed this.  It must be approached with an open mind. Much cannot be proven from so many years ago. He does a good job of explaining what would be the most likely story surrounding Jesus of Nazareth.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Intense, sad, love, all together make the best book out! Action packed, always something new as you turn the page.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I thought this was even better. It stays with you after you finish it. If you were a fan of Kite Runner, you won't be disappointed with this book.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Exciting and emotional, as per usual. You can't help but get attached to these characters and its amazing how human they all are. Flawed and imperfect people.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Prison Break is without doubt one of the best shows i have ever seen. Tense drama in every single show.
0060873175|1.0|This is not even close to any other Crichton work. Good premise but very poorly written. If you expect anything along the lines of all the previous work that actually was written by Crichton you will be sadly disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is hard to play only one game.  It is fun and stimulates your problem solving skills.  Challenging for the beginner and the experienced player.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|My husband has been very happy with the Bushnell Tour V2 Rangefinder purchased 4 months ago.  He said it is easy to use and very accurate.  It has improved his golf game by helping him select the best golf club to use.
B002ONIST6|5.0|A must see movie fully recommend this for any Denzel Washington fan. Awesome movie. Great story line . Go and watch
0385528787|4.0|Since I've read all of Margaret Atwood's books, including the first two of this trilogy, there was no question that I would soak this up.  While I awaited my pre-order, I read her serial Positron.  I'm not sure this was a great idea in retrospect; I felt some of the literary surprises and techniques were anticipated there.  Just to get my quibbles done first:  too much repetition in MaddAddam, perhaps necessary in a serial but not in a single volume.  I'm a sufficiently attentive reader not to need to be reminded of things.  I guess my biggest complaint is its lack of literary finesse -- the writing is just not fabulous.  It's *all* story, all the time.  But what a story.  I realized, to my happiness, that she has written a new Gospel for a new people.  What is the Bible but a collection of stories of people with ridiculous names?  I believe that's the ambition here, and it's outrageous and great.  I can probably count the number of sentences that to me were \\"vintage Atwood.\\"  Otherwise, it's her sparkly, devastating wit and humor that shines through most of all, like the Crakers' eyes.  I'd rate it 4.5 on the star scale!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|With excellent writing, perfect casting, interesting personal relationships and good plot twists, The Good Wife continues to be one of  my all time favorite shows.
0307271080|4.0|This is my first time to read Adichie and I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised as I was hooked from the first page, even though I had grumbled initially when I saw the size of the book. Her writing is elegant and intelligent and yet readable and engaging at the same time. The 477 pages went quickly for me for the most part.<br /><br />It's a sweeping novel that covers quite a good deal in Ifemelu's life. Some readers have complained that the book is too many things - love, immigration, race. The number of themes covered and the way in which it was done did not bother me, as I read the book as a comprehensive story of one particular period in a young immigrant's life. During those years Ifemelu fell in love, dated, moved to another country, studied at university, and moved back. It's a complex time that I could relate to and I found Adichie's handling of the details very real. I also found the issues of race and identity as experienced by an African in America very nuanced. Americanah was a very satisfying read for me because there was enough in there that I could relate to and connect with, enough for me to think about, and enough for me that was new.<br /><br />Yes, things sometimes felt a bit contrived in some parts in the middle when the issue of race is prominent. Opinions go back and forth during dinner meeting discussions (\\"salons\\") with her black American boyfriend and his intellectual friends and the dialogue on race can feel staged. Later, when Ifemelu returns to Nigeria, the same thing happens during get-togethers with other returnees or over coffee with Obinze, her former boyfriend. But I have seen worse and this didn't feel so horribly unnatural - it definitely wasn't enough to reduce my enjoyment of the book (probably because I was fascinated with the issues discussed, and so I was willing to overlook the presentation). However, she is outspoken about race and so different readers will have different comfort levels with this.<br/><br />As for characterization, I couldn't really quite get a handle on Ifemelu. Sometimes her words would surprise me, as I didn't realize how direct and strong (and later rude and entitled) she was until she opened her mouth. The chapters on Obinze are fewer, but somehow I \\"felt\\" him more whereas I felt a little more distant from Ifemelu. I understood Obinze better than I did Ifemelu.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad I picked up this book and I am now a new fan and follower of Ms. Adichie.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|This movie was somewhat disappointing, and I have to rate it just ok.  Too much emphasis on special effects and not enough character development nor plot.  Nothing like, nor as good as,  &#34;The Illusionist&#34; (2006).
B000244FDW|3.0|This is the 3rd movie version of P & P that I've watched, and it's better cast and written than the one with Keira Knightley, but no where near as enjoyable for me as the one with Colin Firth.  Rather than leaving things out that were in the book, this version seems to have added numerous conversations that never took place in the book, and I didn't feel they added to the story.  The casting was okay, I guess, although I didn't care for the actor who played Bingley, nor those portraying Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of them seeming less real somehow than in other versions.  I'm still in the process of watching it, so I don't yet know how I will feel about the ending, but so far, my overall reaction is \\"Meh.\\"
B006S01GH2|5.0|A wonderful visit to Paris with a lovely girl to lead the tour.  Amelie is a great movie filled with odd quirks which are just strange enough to make you laugh out loud all while enjoying a great story with a marvelous cast.
B008K8U13K|3.0|Its a good game and all, but in over all result it's just lame and BORRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNNNG!!! Why would any one get a game that's just crape from the Venuses games of I and II? If I were you I would not I repeat NOT recommend this game.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Wonderful, inspiring movie with Robert Downey Jr. as Charlie Chaplin. Downey is brilliant and the movie is one of the best Hollywood has to offer.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Very good movie! I would most definitely watch it again!  You should see it if you have not seen it!
B004IF8TLU|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. The blues scene is one of the best scenes ever written. I've seen it at least half a dozen times over the years.
B009T9P7OC|5.0|I just love it! It enhanced the music experience for my kindle fire making it worth the money. No problems with this app.
B0030B811Q|5.0|Don't want to spoil the movie but you-know-who about halfway through the movie adds a touch of hilarity that puts this Zombie movie at the top of my movie list! Woody is one of my favorite actors and the cast is great. Seen this one several times and will watch it again.
1579128955|3.0|I was expecting more information on each element like places where it is available most etc. It has limited information about each element. I guess i am expecting too much ;-)
B009A87ZQU|1.0|The first hour is filled with not credible, idiotic action sequences & ugly cinematography. For instance, Bond runs through a wall...really!? Sure, you can run through drywall, but not without knowing what's on the other side! What idiot would try to run through a wall? Bond.<br /><br /> It takes about an hour before the film decides to read the book, but then the film turns Bond into a dufus who can't think for himself and has to have women think for him and dress him, which is NOT any Bond we've ever known, in film nor book.<br /><br /> Bond used to be a man's man..now, he's a feminist's sex symbol..you know, the incompetent guy who is eye candy for the women, but is incapable of self reliance and has to be corrected by the nearest woman at every turn because he can't think for himself and if he tries, then he's wrong. Bond's male audience doesn't want to watch Bond walk out of the ocean ala Ursula Andress. Only the homosexual screenwriters/director and women. Yet, that's what this film does. Also, Bond can't save himself in this film, but has to have women save him.<br /><br />The James Bond Theme song is mostly absent, which destroys the Bond feel. Bond no longer cares if his martini is shaken or stirred. The point of this film is to deconstruct and destroy Bond with only a superficial connection to the book. Anything that Bond would do is mocked, anything that a man would do is mocked. Anything that a women used to do in the older films is now done by a man.<br /><br />They said it was because this film was a new beginning. For the next film they blamed its shortcomings on MGM's bankruptcy. For Skyfall (you know, that generic action film that's missing the heart, soul and spirit of ANY James Bond in film and book where they tried to push homosexuality into Bond), they put the normal opening at the end, once again stating that it's because of a new beginning. I'm tired of their pathetic excuses.<br /><br />Bond is dead. Those now in charge are trying to turn himinto a generic action figure that is no longer a man's man, but a feminist/homosexual idol to please the desires of the screenwriters and bankrupt Hollywood. Bond is now a generic feminist with no relation to Ian Fleming's Bond nor the Bond film history.<br /><br />As usual with the Bond films, they ignore the book for the most part, so there's still potential to make a lot of Bond films that actually follow the books. Unfortunately, those now in charge of his legacy don't like Ian Fleming's Bond and are bent on destroying him to turn him into someone else.
B004GE15MI|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is gorgeous.  Wonderful bitter-sweet story of a relationship.  One of the few movies that I would classify as both romantic comedy and drama.
B007REV4YI|1.0|The heart, soul and spirit of James Bond is nowhere to be found in this film.<br /><br />This is a generic Daniel Craig action film that has no relationship to James Bond. Anyone familiar with the film history or the books knows that they've created a new character with this film. It is not James Bond in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />The cinematography is nice and the audience who is praising this film is praising a non-Bond action film.<br /><br />Nothing Bond does in this film is of any consequence. He's not the hero. He could have died at the beginning and the outcome for everyone else would have been the same. Bond fails at everything he does in this film and he's a feminist, incompetent boy that needs women to do everything for him.<br /><br />James Bond is dead. He's been taken over by feminists.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I read this book with my fifth grade.  They loved it.  Nothing incredibly exciting happens, but the unfolding of a simple story with just enough drama and suspense  keeps the kids intrigued.  It was as fun reading it out loud as an adult as it was reading snuggled in my bed as a child.
B005ZOCFCW|4.0|A well developed story with interesting character profiles. Don't expect a lot of action as this is a slow moving but intriguing look at spy operations back in the Cold War. I was particularly impressed with Le Carre's depth of character development.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|After reading the first two books in this series I was looking forward to the third. He should have stopped after the second instead of just filling pages with mindless details. I caught myself zoning out and had to force myself to finish it only to feel totally cheated by the ending. The ending suggested there may be another book in this series but I certainly won't be buying it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a good wireless headset for the money. The mic has the lowest static hiss of about 8 headsets I've tried so far and has overall good quality. The sound is alright-ish, though only 2 other headsets had better sound. These are Sony PS (which is by the way phenomenal and you should get it NOW) and my old wired Sennheiser PC 360. Be aware that this is a closed headphone, which means it blocks a lot of outside sound, so it's not the best for Skype calls because you won't be able to hear yourself well. A closed headset is only good for noisy LANs.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|An entertaining movie about magic and using it to commit crimes. Some of it was filmed near where I work in Chinatown.
0385347774|4.0|There is almost nothing I can say about this book that won't give something away, and that would deny a reader some of the same wrenching pleasure I got from the story.  This can be said: Nick from Missouri and Amy from New York meet, fall in love, marry, and then lose their New York jobs.  They move to Nick's hometown on the banks of the Mississippi River, and on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary Amy goes missing.  Did she wander off?  Signs of a struggle suggest not.  Was she kidnapped?  Killed?  If so, by whom?  And then we're off to the races.  I don't read enough in this genre to know whether this is supposed to be classified as a mystery, or a thriller, or what.  But I don't really care.  It worked for me, by which I mean it drew me in and didn't ever bore me.  Sure, there are some parts that are slower than others, and at times I wanted to hurry things along a bit, but there was never a time when I didn't want to know what happened next, and more than one place where I didn't want the thing to happen that was actually happening.  Gillian Flynn skillfully weaves a plot in two voices, and she is able to maintain the voice of the two main characters (or three, maybe) even as your feelings for them change--perhaps dramatically--over the course of the novel.  By the end you are questioning just about everything that formed the initial hooks for the story: Nick, Amy, love, marriage, strength, truth, you name it.  I'm still not certain whether or not I like the way Flynn finishes it all up, but that probably just means that she didn't take the easy way out, or that I didn't get the payoff I wanted, or that life is messier than that and very few relationships are tied up with neat bows.  In a way, the ending is a natural outcome of everything you learn about the characters over the course of the novel.  That's probably what leaves some readers unsatisfied.  You can't always get what you want.  Just ask Nick Dunne.<br /><br />Be advised that the language is very rough.  If a voice in your head vocalizes stories you read (as my little head voice does), you'll have an interesting time of it if these are not words you normally use.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|This is one of the weakest of the Star Trek movies. It is loud and frantic. There is a small amount of humor but not as much as the previous movie. Fans will appreciate seeing the inside of the Enterprise on a grand scale. Not bad but I would not watch this movie a second time. I was very happy to see one of my favorite actresses appear in a small role - Aisha Hinds. She took Chekov's place on the bridge when he went to Engineering. I love her in \\"Under The Doom\\" and also here in a very small part.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Too addicting at times and pistol is fun to use at times. Probably the most op to me right now.

B000OIZUW6|5.0|As all Ken Folletts books are, it was great.  Gives a lot of insight to the war.  Acurate history. Great reading.  Makes you feel like your are part of the story.

1932100660|5.0|Appreciated that it is all based on studies and numbers, not personal beliefs. Book is not about ethics of killing/eating animals, strictly discusses the health benefits of NOT eating animal based foods. Interesting to read, easy to read, lots of graphs, lots of references.
B005I4JG80|5.0|The author writes in an entertaining, easy-to-follow style as she shares the challenges of parenthood and her reflections on various methods.  She doesn't hesitate to question her own decisions, share her worries, or poke holes in some accepted practices.  She provides an eyeopening view of the differences of parenting in France while providing new ideas and methods for parents to consider.  It was especially refreshing to me to read her views and concerns with the long term effects of &#34;helicopter parenting&#34; that is rampant in the US, and posit some improved methods.
B00992CF6W|4.0|great game not glitchy but it wood make this game really awesome if they had minecarts... but other than that really great

B00EAI9CSY|4.0|An amazing new take on the vampire genre film and it most definitely takes you on an interesting journey. The two female leads did an amazing job and the director guided you through this amazing path of love ,fear,hope and death!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love the characters they fit the part so well.  Liked the new Kahn much better than the original. Quite the twist when Kirk is the one who dies rather than Spock, of course it is a different time line.  Should have buried him in space then we could have had &#34;The Search for Kirk.&#34;  (Just kidding)
B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of P&P is considered the best--for good reason. And this new restored version is much better than the earlier, washed-out DVD that came out a few years ago. The extras are good too.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun but confusing.  It would be great if they provided a &#34;hint&#34; button.  Some objects can be seen but never picked up.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Well I do not find the paid game any better than the free game, other than having ads and such. Are the ads really that bad... no. Look if you like angry birds you might like this one, if you like star wars then you might like this one, but if you like angry birds and star wars then you will like this one. It really is not as clever as family guy's star wars remakes but it passes the time.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I had to download as soon as I finished book 2. I wasn't sure where the book was going. There is a lot going on-lots of stories coming together to fit the big picture.<br />It was good, but feel that. Book 1 is the best. But you must read book 2 to read book 3.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love the series.  However, this one is a little too long.  Now there are even more characters to remember. I look forward to the next book.  Hopefully, it will end the Game of Thrones.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Not as good as I thought it would be.  Seems to be no way to flip the deck over and go thru until you have no plays left.

B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoy these because they keep a person guessing as the story develops.  I also enjoy the<br />twist of having someone who is first on the defensive before gaining the offensive in the end.<br />Reacher is a big guy who is unique to the usual style of novel heroes.

B00EDF43MY|5.0|This game is so good for little kids. I got this game on the day it was free, and the full version was the best. A must get for little kids.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Just watched the movie on rental, rushed over to Amazon to buy the DVD because I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't wait to get the extras that come with the disc.  Also, I really enjoyed J.J. Abram's commentary track from the first Star Trek film and was looking forward to what he had to say about this one.  But guess what?  The commentary track is only available as an iTunes download!?!  Are you freakin' kidding me?  I'm going to pay money for a DVD with commentary that I can't even watch on my TV?!  I hope it was greed that motivated Paramount's ridiculous strategy for releasing their extras, because, guess what?  I'm not buying it now!!  I hope one of the \\"marketing geniuses\\" behind this strategy reads this and expedites a proper release of the extras for this movie, one that hopefully doesn't punish the fans for giving you their money.  Even Khan isn't that evil!!!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|One of the most delightful fantasies ever. At the end, you are left wondering what parts of the story are true and what parts are hallucinations. The photography is stunning and the visual effects are amazing. One actually believes the young boy is sharing a boat with a vicious tiger. The moral underlying the storyline: whether the reality of religious beliefs is real or whether the mundane is real is left for us to ponder and to choose which suits us best. Thoroughly enjoyable from every aspect
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is my first book by Moriarty. I plan to try out some other titles. If you like &#34;relationship&#34; books this is for you. Some surprises with a little predictability. Definately an interesting read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very enjoyable style, the kind of story you don't want to end but can't wait to find out how it ends. It was good to revisit the characters who seem like old friends.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|This is really a nice watch. I would recomend it to anyone who need a eye catching watch in your wrist
B0053TMP24|5.0|Excellent book. This book continues the story very well, the pacing is good, and the characters are enjoyable to root for.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|The family often plays this quick and easy game during dinner.  We loved it so much, we even bought the iDevice versions and play on the road too.  The best part is how you determine who starts the game.  The first player is the person who can say &#34;Brraaaaiiinns&#34; the best.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I've had a 20 year obsession with Phantom of the Opera, so when I heard about this it got my attention. But after reading details, I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. I hated the idea of the dashing, romantic Raoul being turned into a drunken gambler, of his marriage to Christine on the rocks, or of the change in the characters of Mdm Giry and Meg. But curiosity got the better of me and I rented it. I hated it, just as I suspected I would. I disliked Ben Lewis as the Phantom, thinking his facial expressions grotesque. But it consumed my every thought, and I watched it again. And again. I liked Beneath A Moonless Sky and downloaded it, then Till I Hear You Sing, Love Never Dies, then the entire soundtrack. I watched it every night, and decided I must really love hating it. Somewhere I stopped being such a mean critic, and came to truly appreciate the depth and emotion Lewis puts into the Phantom, and realized that Love Never Dies COMPLETES the story (just ignore the dates). The costumes are exquisite, the music is beautiful, and I hardly think anyone could portray the Phantom's utter heartbreak better than Lewis. His tall, lean, well dressed physique exudes confidence, quite a commanding presence, and O'Byrne displays all the grace and poise one would expect of a vicomtesse.  I'm hooked, just as I was with POTO 20 years ago, and a month after discovering it I still watch part of it every night, and listen to the CD every day. I wish I could have seen Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess as the Phantom and Christine, and I wish I could get a CD of Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne. Karimloo and Boggess have excellent voices, but Lewis has a richness and O'Byrne a sweetness that I prefer.<br />The only fault I can find is the mispronunciation of Pagliacci (reporter - intended, I assume) and Cherbourg (by Raoul, both soundtrack and film).

140006922X|4.0|I wish that the furor over Reza Aslan's book, \\"Zealot,\\" had never occurred. The outage over a Mulim writing a book about Jesus was a huge distraction, and set up the kind of phony battle lines that our culture is famous for. On one side, the conservative and Islamophobes who hated the book on principle because of its author's religious identity. On the other, the atheists and the kind of reflexive liberals who support whatever their enemies hate. In the middle are those like me who hope to read the book on its own merits.<br /><br />And while those merits are well-deserved, they are too often shaky.<br /><br />The main thesis of Zealot is that Jesus of Nazareth was very much a person of his own era. Like many others in his day, he was antagonistic to the economic inequities that were becoming more pronounced in first-century Galilee. Like many others, he looked upon the Roman occupiers as signs of evil times in Israel. Aslan wants us to believe that Jesus, while not an armed rebel leader, was a Jewish nationalist bent on removing the Romans fro m Israel. It's this thesis that, In the end, he fails to prove.<br /><br />Along the way, however, Aslan treats us to many aspects of 1st century life that are generally unknown to casual believers, and which are worthwhile keeping in the mix when we try to understand Jesus and his times. He will also introduce readers to aspects of New Testament scholarship and history that are shocking to the lay worshipper, yet are (for the most part) well established among non-fundamentalist scholars. While he has a tendency to embrace the most shocking scholarly hypotheses  (no Joseph!) and accepts or rejects the historicity of certain gospel traditions in his own unique manner, his opinions are not out of line with what many scholars say about Jesus and the first century world.<br /><br />In the first century, the ancient subsistence farming economy was breaking down under the pressure of increased taxation from the Romans. Small shareholders found it increasingly difficult to  maintain themselves in an economy where 50% of their earnings were siphoned off to the Romans, to local landowners to pay off debts, or to the Temple treasury in Jerusalem. Add to this the local political instability. When kings like Herod the Great were in power, they hired lavishly from the local peasantry to build and to decorate their new cities. When kings died or were overthrown in revolts, these artisans and other workers were out of work, unable to return to failed farms and unable to find new work.<br /><br />Aslan does a nice job of explaining the Temple economy, which required Jews to sacrifice animals (which cost money) in order to fulfill their religious observances. He does skate the edge of anti-Semitism by calling the priestly class, and their money changing network,  \\"moneygrubbers.\\" But to the average illiterate and impoverished Jew, with no other recourse for forgiveness of sins and removal of impurity, the machinery of the Temple's sacrificial system was ruinous financially. It might well be that this led people like Jesus to wonder whether  it was also empty spiritually.<br /><br />Aslan tries hard to draw a straight line between the Jesus of the gospels and the various messiahs and rebels that sprouted up during this time period. He thinks that when Jesus asks his disciples whether they have swords (they produce two) this makes him a bandit leader. He takes literally Jesus's statement that he came not to bring peace, but the sword. He claims that \\"Render under to Caesar\\" was a political statement about returning the land to Jewish ownership. And he makes too much of the short, violent scuffle in Gethsemane when Jesus was arrested. Yet though it's doubtful that Jesus welcomed the Romans into Israel, there is a great deal of subtlety here that Aslan does not bring up. For instance, Jesus's command to turn the other cheek is hardly the kind of advice a Rome-hater would proffer. And neither is his advice to walk two miles with the soldier who pressed him to carry a load for one mile. If Jesus wanted Rome to go, it was God who would make that happen. And that is a critical difference between Messiah Jesus and all the other messiahs of his age.<br /><br />Aslan is correct in his statements that Jesus foresaw a reversal of fortune in the near future. (Read Luke's \\"Magnificat\\" if you want to get an idea of how radical was early Christianity!) Jesus saw the Twelve disciples as judges who would rule over the twelve tribes of Israel. He saw himself as the Son of Man, a conquering figure drawn from the Bible's eschatological tradition. Aslan is correct that Jesus offered a critique of the Temple system, at a time when the Temple leaders and Roman overlords were in uneasy alliance against rebels and others who would cause disturbances. And he is correct in seeing Jesus's cleansing of the Temple - with its direct physical action against the money changers - as the action that precipitated his arrest and death. Finally, he is completely on target by noting that crucifixion was a Roman punishment, not a Jewish one. It was reserved for political crimes - sedition, rebellion, treason and revolt.<br /><br />While Christians have complicated and overthought Jesus's teaching in order to make him seem too other-wordly,  Aslan has gone too far the other way, making him too ordinary. For Jesus to have been seen as a threat to Rome and the Temple did not require him to advocate physical violence against them. Given the cruel and suspicious times, it was enough that he was actively planning to rule Israel, after God intervened in history, in place of the Romans. An ethical teacher and self-styled prophet, whose healings taught the peasantry that God was on their side, didn't have to raise a finger or an army to seem like a threat to established power. Merely by publicly standing against them, rather than sinking into safety and anonymity, Jesus drew too much public attention to himself and had to be dealt with. Pilate's writing on Jesus's titulus -- \\"King of the Jews\\" -- was a cruel joke,  something that Aslan thinks the Romans, those spawners of satirists and bawdy poets, were incapable of.<br /><br />Though \\"Zealot\\" contains a great deal of scholarship, the book has serious faults. Aslan minimizes the range of opinion within biblical scholarship.  One scholar might reject the birth narratives as entirely spurious, while another finds some or much truth in them. Aslan, for instance, goes farther tha n most in suggesting that Joseph, Mary's betrothed and Jesus's step father, did not exist. He suggests that Mary was an unwed mother, which has some possible support in Jesus's opponents calling him \\"Son of Mary.\\" But though this is a legitimate hypothesis, it's hardly the consensus of scholars. Aslan is also somewhat arbitrary in his rejection of gospel verses that he doesn't like. Gone are the trial before Pilate, the infancy narratives (Jesus was born in Nazareth) and even a synagogue in Jesus's hometown (though he later backtracks and suggests that there might have been a room devoted to the Torah). And he is maddenigly contradictory. The Jews of Jesus time were mostly illiterate, yet Jeses seems to have been familiar with Scripture, and his disciples enough so to immediately bring to mind that Jesus as being \\"zealous for the law\\" when he cleaned the Temple. Most unforgivably, though, for Aslan and his editors, he commits some serious errors of fact. He thinks the Sea of Galilee was salty, when it is an inland, fresh-water lake. He confuses James the son of Zebedee with James the brother of the Lord. He claims (in opposition to actual archeological finds) that Jesus was nailed through wrists (OK , so says the possibly-forged Shroud of Turin) and ankles, which don't have the same bone structure as wrists! And that Jesus  carried the crossbeam of the cross (most scholars agree on this) but that it was attached to an upright laid on the ground, which was then hoisted up into position. Though these errors not consequential to his thesis about Jesus as a religiously-zealous Jewish nationalist, they do point to a rather slapdash creation for what should have been a very careful analysis.<br /><br />For all its shortcomings, Aslan's \\"Zealot\\" is not a bad book. It is certainly not an attack on Christianity or on the person of Jesus. And, taken with a grain of salt, it will expose readers to controversies about Jesus's life that scholars have been wrestling with for years. The book is the continuing effort, by people of goodwill twenty centuries after the death of Jesus, to make sense of a figure of immense complexity and seeming contradictions. I don't agree that  Aslan's Jesus is as \\"compelling, charismatic and praiseworthy\\" as the Christ worshipped in churches. But taken with an element of caution and skepticism, it does sketch a story of his times that is richer and more robust than the watered down Jesus of sermons and popular culture.d had to be dealt with.

B000035P5E|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie!  The quality of the DVD is excellent and the acting is superb.  One of Sutherland's best.<br />EH
034580709X|5.0|What can I say, Jo Nesbo has done it again!!  The Bat filled some gaps about Harry.  Harry is one complex person.
B002XZOZQA|2.0|I saw the actual Broadway show years ago and THIS was a major disappointment. I expected them to change things to adapt to the screen but NOT the music!  Geez, in place of a couple of my favorite songs they put in new ones?  And frankly, Cassie was really getting on my nerves the whole time.  I watched the entire thing but it was a disappointment knowing what I should have been seeing/hearing based on the original show.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This book is so full with action and adventure and love I couldn't keep my eyes off its like if it was real.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Amazing movie especially for a former ballerina. But you don't have to dance to love the incredible writing and drama. Must see!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is fun for all ages. Challenging but not overly so.  My kids love it and so do I.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|well written, exploring human themes, touching with lovely descriptions of people and places. A story of a marriage lost over decades and now recaptured
B00EEXST2K|4.0|I was around when Deep Throat first came out in the theatre.  I did not see it, so I was skeptical about watching Lovelace, but, a friend had seen it and said it was a very good movie.  I watched it and now know the back story about Linda Lovelace. A compelling biography
B0016K40KY|4.0|Ordered this DVD version so I could see on my DVD player.  Lawrence is a classic and will always be one of my all time favorite movies from the 60's.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is the sequel to the Legand of the Guardians and I intend to use it as a birthday gift for my nephew.
B0051OZ564|5.0|Sucker punch is a stylized and action packed film that delves into the world of a mentally troubled young woman known as Baby Doll. The movie offers a surrealistic examination of mental illness and challenges the viewer to decipher the allegory presented in vibrant and stunning fantasy scenes. Although dark and melancholy Sucker Punch is wildly entertaining and provides an interesting thesis on despair and hope.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Enjoy playing a lot, love the minions . The graphics are really nice. Great game, glad that I downloaded it. There is plenty of stuff in the free version.
B007C7UZIG|2.0|Obviously you can't play games in the app or anything,  but for some reason,  it just had to email me a security code because it's afraid of the fact I'm logging in through my tablet.  Okay,  I did that.  Then I got in and it gave me access to most of the website and ability to chat with friends.  It didn't give me what I wanted, however.  I wanted to be able to visit the forums and post on them.  I don't get to read forum updates or anything.  So, for that I'll give it 2 stars.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I'm amazed that so many people decided to review this movie.  I don't know that it warrants that much scrutiny, possible praise, or well deserved condemnation.  For me, there wasn't much to generate an opinion in the first place.  It's an ambitious, spiritless, CGI-fest stretched beyond all endurance.  That it took four people to pen the screenplay says a lot about the way the story meanders aimlessly, employing the `stacked deck' theory of writing, until it finally fizzles with a whimper of an ending.  The other part of the problem is deciding which lead actress to blame for an outstanding show of mediocrity.  Most of Charlize Theron's performance is due to special effects and a great deal of posing, otherwise she only hit two notes, screeching ineffectively and just standing there trying to look pretty.  Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, did nothing to inspire that much devotion, she is simply incapable of emoting with any amount of credibility.  That they are planning a sequel with her in the starring role begs the question why.  This movie already took forever to leave out the happily ever after finale, what more to the story can they add, a secret sister with a grudge, planning to take over with Theron failed?<br />It should be noted that Chris Hemsworth did most of the heavy lifting in this epic; otherwise, it's just a dreary mess.<br /><br />Can't hate it, don't like it...........eh.

B00005V9IL|5.0|Needed better special features {read-alongs ar NOT acceptable}, like interviews, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc., but the movie itself is fabulous.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|Has it really been 40 years? I guess it has been. Murray Perahia is one of my generation's great pianists. Coming of age as a performer during analogues final decade, his early maturity came about during the advent of the compact disc. (as well as the demise of Advent, whose natural sounding speakers graced man a dormitory room!) Now, the CD is moribund, but Perahia is undergoing a renaissance of sorts, having succesfully recovered from a debilitating condition that limited his playing during the intervening years.<br /><br />Quiet, unassuming, adhering to composer's intent and rejecting flamboyant virtuosity (and rejcecting Horowitz as a teacher!), Perahia has sometimes been referred to as a \\"pianist's pianist\\". I have enjoyed Perahia's performances from the start, and yet I had held off from purchasing this box set due to budget restrictions, and some inevitable duplications of discs purchased during these \\"first 40 years\\" - but recent reductions in cost by amazon re-sellers have made this set a bargain. And what a joy it is to listen to! Perahia certainly has his share of admirers and detractors - the latter claim his performances are somewhat dull and lack individual character. Other, myself included, hear pure, limpid readings without the frills, ornamentations, or distractions of other pianists. True, one may miss the profound insights to be discovered in say, Richter's Schubert. On the other hand, Perahia provides extraordinary musicianship and keen insight to forge natural presentation of the music. Music that seems to be effortlessly released from the confines of a written page, into your listening room.<br /><br />Others have provided their comments regarding interpreations during the 40 years these recordings cover, so allow me to point out some things relevant to the box itself. First - it's big and it's heavy. A well designed box true, but a design that lays the formidable hardcover book on top of the CDs making them reletively inaccessible for those spontaineous moments of \\"oh-I-think-I'll listen-to-some-Schubert\\" who should I listen to, oh, maybe not Perahia; I'd have to deal with that box....  Admit it. We've all had those moments. My suggestion (purists, prepare to cringe) gently pull on the inner box containing the CDs and gently tear it from its housing. (I know, I know). The CDs (which are Sony Original Jacket series types) will then sit nicely on your shelves, and their spines are easily readable. The handsome DVD case sit on my DVD shelves, and the book is nestled away in the original box where I can access it when I feel like it.<br /><br />Second - the sound. Gorgeous. Comparing some of the earlier recordings (the duets with Radu Lupu, the Mendelssohn discs, the Schubert Impromptus, and the Mozart/Beethoven Quintets) one hears greater warmth, balance and depth. I've donated the original discs to my library.<br /><br />As I get older, I find myself having greater appreciation of the production values of the music I'm hearing. I still pull those Tahra remasters from the shelves (Furtwangler!! Jochum!!) but modern digital recordings, properly re-mastered, truly cast a spell over me. If you consider yourself an audiophile, this is a set of recordings that you will treasure. It is a set with many peaks (the Mozart piano concertos/duets with Lupu, most of the Schubert and Mendelssohn, the Beethoven Concertos with a perfectly matched conductor, Haitink, as well as his more recent Bach) and very few valleys (I'll let you decide).<br /><br />If anything, this box documenting Perahia's First 40 Years has only whetted my appetite for his next 30 (as well as my own, so I can listen to him!)<br /><br />UPDATE: Oct 2014 - Since purchasing Perahia's box I've added several others to my collection. I continue to stand by this particular box set is the greatest value currently being offered for major works in the piano repertoire. Horowitz at Carnegie may offer flashier, legendary, though idiosyncratic playing as does Gould's Bach. Fleisher and Janis both offer legendary performances (at least in the the former's case) with mediocre sound (still well worth owning however). Perahia is not the flashiest, and certainly not at all idiosyncratic. The amazon hyper-critics may characterize his playing as indistinctive. Pity. It remains gloriously musical, intelligent, thoughtful - and thanks to the quality of the recordings - beautiful to listen to. I still have no question in my mind that this box set is the greatest value currently being offered on amazon.com. The DVDs are icing on the cake. Grab it - before it disappears into the MP3 netherworld.uld's Bach.

B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Not bad, but the costume was ridiculously cheesy. The special effects were actually very good.  Most sequels are terrible, but this might have been better than the first.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|The album is really good, and it's cool she recorded it here in Tucson...I hope she plays here sometime....Hopefully she will, we need more good live music in Tucson.....
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|An excellent read. I loved the humor and the case studies of how people manifested their goals.  It was very clear in how to read the book and how go about performing these exercises..  I personally tried some of exercises with very good results..  Thank You Pam for writing this book.. I loved reading it .
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I have used several different brain training games and I like the large number of games included in this package. I found the other software packages felt much more like training where this seems to be more amusing.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition. My son has seen it at least 7 times since we received it. The shipping was also very satisfactory. I will buy again that's for sure.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|A really great show with wonderful dialog. Can't wait for the next season. I can't even imagine the surprises of future episodes
B000IZAHB4|5.0|the first one was really good but i already have it on dvd. this is a great film but how come you dont have van helsing?
030758836X|3.0|This is the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn. Did she have a movie contract before she wrote this? Very contrived in places but an entertaining read. I can't say I loved it but it was a fast and compelling read. I hear Ben Affleck is playing Nick. Huh? Nick is supposed to be in his early 30's. Affleck is way too old and not a stupid pretty boy. Plenty of those in Hollywood.
1439102813|5.0|Okay so it's hard to recommend to friends who are not drawn to the story of cognitive decline of a woman of great  intellect and drive, but this is a terrific read. Genova takes us inside of Alice's heart and mind almost from the start and we are captivated by Alice's attention to detail and passion for living even as we see every roadblock emerge and confound and humiliate her. This is a story of loss and persistence and it is a story of love and sustenance. Even as in most important ways it sheds light on early stage Alzheimers', it tells a universal tale of journeying forth and what is lost and gained along the way. A book not to be missed.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Fantastic! Exciting! Perplexing! I can't believe I'm watching season after season of this junk! My brain must have gotten smaller with each season. Too much time spent at the beach this summer. And I thank my daughter for poking me on this nonsense.
