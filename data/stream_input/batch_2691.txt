B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unlike so much mindless programming on TV, this show has numerous and good story lines with complex characters, beautiful settings and a touch of history. I hope that there are many more seasons to come.  This type of series shows us what TV can be!
B00030DEQE|5.0|Installed this in my sons computer to help with his online gaming and it works perfectly! Thanks for a great product and price!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I have yet to finish the book, but when I was watching the movie I couldn't help but cringe. I think reading the book has put me at a disadvantage, in a sense.<br /><br />I just, I think my biggest issue with the cast. Some of the actors were poorly chosen, and yeah...
B005544V6A|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  Smart and funny!  Great dialog between character, excellent storylines.  Highly recommend this series to anyone.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It's a great game. I enjoy playing it  got to get that booty. My family plays it to  's sadeyes loves this game
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|{3.5 stars}<br /><br />Nothing too deep or complex, and could be called a bit predictable. Still, THE LAST STAND is well-filmed and well-acted and accomplishes what it sets out to do quite well. There are some decent twists and surprises here, as well as many good chase scenes. Schwarzenegger really shines as a very human hero, Sheriff Ray Owens of Sommerton Junction, AZ.<br /><br />I usually don't like films that try to combine ultra-violence and gore with slapstick humor, but THE LAST STAND does this in just the right places to just the right extent. While it's intended as a basically serious film, it also makes some brief but very natural transitions into a spaghetti western spoof. Enjoyed it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great...just great...!!! we need more games like this please make a second part i like it... i love it....we love it...hahaha..great job... im out of words...
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Dang good sci-fi pseudo-horror film.<br />I say pseudo-horror because the visceral horror elements only carry you through part of the film.  The true horror ... well, you have to watch it. ;)<br /><br />If you think Alien is a classic, then you'll enjoy this movie.
B000CCHUY0|2.0|This is a great movie but it came as a PAL format and my DVD player does not play support that format.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Magic 2014 works great on Kindle Fire HD 7. The graphics are wonderful and the gameplay is very entertaining. Makes me want to dust off my old Magic collection!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Good story lines, and it will get you hooked on these peoples lives and how mean and nice others can be. I cant wait for season 4!!!
B006K1IIHA|5.0|This how is amazing!  Bought this for my daughter who is a die hard fan...great plots, camera angles are awesome and it is like nothing I've seen before.  Yes, she has converted me  :)  Come on Season 3!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The worst book I have ever read.  A complete waste of time.  I finally read it just because I was the only person I know who hadn't, and curiosity got the better of me. What the heck is all the fuss about?  How did this crap (one of Anastasia's favorite words) get published? I feel like a moron for reading it.  It is that bad.
B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|not as well-written as his other two books about Afghanistan.  moving, though, bit hard to follow.  the kindle edition had irregular font (sigh) as usual, and misspellings.  overpriced at almost $19.00
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never watched this during the TV airing. I saw it on the Prime videos and had heard all the buzz about the show. I started with the first season and watched all 3 seasons in 3 days!  Great story and actors. Maggie Smith is a hoot too. Now I can't wait for the 4th season to air.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This app is so cool! My kids love it and I have played it some. I got it when it was free but it would be worth paying for.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|It's like temple run but so much cuter and more challenging. I love how there are tons of characters to choose from.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|won't win any awards but was entertaining and fun to watch. Don't expect much more than that and keep an open mind.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app. It works well and is a good addition to my Kindal Fire. There are some apps you wish you never downloaded and those that you wonder how you ever got along without them. This is one that I wonder how I ever got along without.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Up lifting story,  eccentric funny project processed in humorous way.<br />I didn't like the main guy Don, but  It was fun to read. Recommended if you want giggles.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Loved this game it took a while to figure out but I enjoyed it. Just wished there was more levels.
B00BU18U82|5.0|this game is shockingly amazing on how realistic it is so if you ever want to play a high deatled realitsc farming game then buy this game and play it you will love it and get hoocked on it just like me so download it today and you will have fun with it!!! :)
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Enjoy playing the game.had to start over after the upgrade.was not to happy about that. Would recommend the game to all my friends
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played it since it came out its the best game and I cant level up any more my favorite boost is the jet pack boss.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent cast. Gripping. Many story lines encompassing suspense, romance, history, social issues.  I remember being enthralled with &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; way back when.  &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is even better.  If you enjoy larger than life family sagas set in England in the late 1800's - early 1900's, don't miss this series.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Although the first season had many changes from the books, the second's are more significant and so it failed to really hold my interest. I'm sure it's still thoroughly entertaining for people new to the series.
0143115014|2.0|\\"Perfumes: the A to Z Guide\\" is a rather mixed bag (fortunately the two authors initial their contributions, so it is easy to find why the bag is so mixed). The introductory parts and the reviews by Tania Sanchez are largely informative and a pleasure to read. Both the introduction and the reviews by Luca Turin are turgid, pompous, filled with pointless rhetorical flourishes, and remarkably uninformative. I might add that Turin's much publicized \\"vibrational\\" theory of olfaction is largely discredited, though that has little to do with this book.<br /><br />Still, though Turin sometimes makes me want to vomit, this is a serviceable book with no current alternative out there. The introductory sections are worth reading, but I would use the on-line systems at Fragrantica and Basenotes for reviews.
B008EKOIN8|3.0|I love Michael Pollan. I've read a number of his books, I watch him whenever he makes appearances on television, and I wholeheartedly subscribe to his philosophy. But, geez-o-wiz, that guy needs an editor. Bad. I have to admit I could not finish this book. What I could get through was laborious and tedious and wordy and repetitive. Seriously, he needs to fire his current editor because that person obviously was sleeping on the job.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Omg I'm love this book because it gave me some insight about loving your hair an  I like the different tips that was distribute to me about going natural and how some ladies were  battle cancer and had to  cut their hair off....recommend to anyone that is going natural... I would have to say that I'm a modify cg girl cuz some of the strategy don't work for me like one of my favorite blogger mahogany curls.....
B0011MRKHW|4.0|I usually love history movies.. this moves slow much like the first movie, Elizabeth, however it is good. However I probably won't watch this over and over as I do other movies..
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Takes me back to the times when my son was on drugs; good strong music and some confronting lyrics.  Not all the album is as good as some of the tracks, but it is worth buying for the ones that really &#34;get&#34; you.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|OMG. Such ups. Such downs. Such amazing actors, sets, costumes, story lines. I may not recover from the cliffhanging ending.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I was captivated by thr Crawley family and their &#34;downstairs&#34; immediately.  I found who I liked and the ones that weren't so nice in the help category.  Unless you are a hater of all things British, this will be a good choice for anyone.  I love it and hate to finish the last two episodes of Season 3.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Slender: Chapter one alone, has got to be one of, if not the best slender game on the market. After browsing through scams and reading reviews about how horrible those games were, I was on the verge of giving up. My thoughts were &quot; is anyone willing to make a slender game, that is decently similar to eight pages?&quot; After about 10 more minutes of searching I found this game. I was of course skeptical about this, thinking about the other horrible vile mistakes, I death debug decided to just pay the dollar and try it. It was one of the best 99 cents I have ever spent. I can't get enough of the heart pounding, adrenaline rushing terror this gave can offer. If you yourself are skeptical and reading this review, don't just take my word for it. Try it yourself. But remember, roses are red, Violets are blue, dont turn around, he's right behind you.
B0026IQYEA|3.0|It's okay. I love history movies and this was good but seemed to move slow. I think most history fans will like it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|He is a bit like Dylan, a bit like James Taylor, but mostly like himself.  Unique and confronting, great lyrics and some really sold tracks.  I think I like this CD the best of several I have heard.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very well-written and exciting book that had me guessing until the very end. I would recommend this to all readers! I kept thinking I had the &#34;whodunit&#34; solved, and was mistaken over and over. Loved it!
034580404X|5.0|Love these books. The characters are great and even though people read them mostly for the erotic parts I found my self continuously laughing out loud at Anastasia and how she handled Christian.
0066620996|3.0|I'm not a business genius or anything like that but I've heard this book referenced so many times in so many different things that I have or currently read that I had to buckle down and get this book from the library to see what all the fuss was about.<br />Well, the good thing is that it seems to have a lot of solid research and I'm assuming the guy is pretty respectable since this book gets referenced so much (I'm going to look into his other books on a casual mission to see why he's such a big deal).<br />I really like the fair criteria for a company to be called \\"good to great\\" and I really respect that he and his team didn't want greatness to be determined by the old cliche' that it's about leadership - and then it was about leadership.<br />I've been thinking a lot about the Level 5 leadership thing and it's helped me analyze myself better.<br />In the end, I give it 3 Stars because it's pretty academic and so I'm not sure it's a great book for the masses.<br />I also have discovered that most of my business-esque pals reference this book a lot but don't really understand the key concepts I think. Thought that was typical and interesting at the same time - like all these business dudes know they should know this book and bought the cliff notes summary or something like that.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Bought all 3 books to better understand the point of the story. I'm glad I read them since so many talked about it, but I don't understand it's mass appeal.
B003K15INU|5.0|Finally, the truth about the grown up lives of the golden boys and girls we all envied and what happened to them when life threw them a curve. The writing is superb.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Kept me mesmerized and engaged the entire time! Not a moment of lull or boredom! Can't wait to start on Book 2  of this amazing Trilogy!!!
B00000IQC8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much I bought it as a gift for a frient who hadn't seen it. Good purchase
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game to play. Recommended to anyone who likes war games and the military. Also good for passing the time.
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|In this sequel to the 2006 film \\"Silent Hill,\\" a young girl Heather Mason (Adelaide Clemens), constantly tormented by weird nightmares, is to travel to Silent Hill, West Virginia, when her adaptive father Harry (Sean Bean) mysteriously disappears.<br /><br />What follows is bad writing, cheap jump scares and over-the-top Malcolm McDowell. There are some nice effects of characters/creatures such as Pyramid Head and Nurses from the original Konami game, but the story is incoherent with events that happen randomly. The slow-paced film does not develop characters or build up tension. It does not even bother to scare us.<br /><br />In addition to Sean Bean, some of the original film's players come back, which only makes me want to go back to the first \\"Silent Hill\\" film. Christophe Gans' original may not be a classic horror, but knows how to scare us. Don't go to \\"Silent Hill: Revelation 3D.\\" Whether it's 2D or 3D, it doesn't matter. There is really nothing interesting to see there.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|fast, easy, and able to reach your notes anywhere.  I like simple.  Evernote is just that.  No fancy stuff just what a writer needs.
0374533555|5.0|This book is not the usual autobiography. Sure, it has information about how Kahneman came up with some insights, about his working relationship with Amos Tversky, about the various places he has worked and the friends he made along the way. But Kahneman the person plays only a minor part in this book--by far most of the book is about the ideas Kahneman helped develop, ideas which have become increasingly important in economics and political science.<br />Kahneman's work, which identifies biases in human decision-making, is potentially useful on a personal level: a person aware of those biases could make adjustments to correct for them. I think intelligent young people would especially benefit from reading this book--it's fun to read and interesting, and should be accessible to the upper tail of college freshmen.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|good jw cd...had it all...old stuff..mixed with new.<br />(guitar work i mean)..guest artists a plus!!!!!!!!!good bye see you later folks
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Discovered this series late, as we don't have HBO. However, having caught two season 6 episodes while travelling, I decided to have a look. Have since seen all of season 1 and half of season 2. So far, so good!
B008JFUR10|1.0|This review is for the movie, Not the Blu-ray.<br /><br />just came back from seeing PACIFIC RIM.  Here is my review: don't waste your money unless you are  a 15 year old boy and don't care about hearing loss.<br /><br />Very disappointing. I won't give away any spoilers, although i don't see how I could since there is barely a plot.<br /><br />Great cast & great director and yet this movie feels like the equivalent of a Bernie Madoff scam, lots of money invested, but no dividend.<br /><br />Merge Transformers 2 and Starship Troopers add Godzilla (or Godzillas) into the mix then remove the humor & cultural parody, add more fight scenes and noise, make the film as dark as possible so the audience is force to squint throughout and you have PACIFIC RIM.<br /><br />And before you rain down the hate on me, let me mention that I loved Transformers (the first one) and the campy Starship Troopers, and am a fan of Godzilla & monster movies.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro unfortunately struck out on this one.
0060763280|5.0|I enjoy reading books on business, sales and self improvement and I have read some of the best but some pretty much say the same thing, keep a positive attitude, be your best, work to be number one etc. I thought I already read all the great books until I saw T. Harv Ekers book on a Top Ten list.  200 pages into the book and I am already looking to see if this author has written any other books.  My wife and I have already worked hard for decades and built up a very strong investment portfolio while also paying off our house but I still found some great tips, lessons and advice in this great book.  T. Harv Eker is in the same class as Kiyosaki, Trump, Cardone and Eric Qualman. What I liked about T. Harv Ekers book is that he throws a curve ball meaning he has several ideas and thoughts that the other great authors don't touch on, that is the reason this books is clearly a \\"Buy\\". I would write more but I want to get back to SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics and easy to use. Great way to pass the time. Would love to see more breeds available and more ways to customize your horse.

6302484391|5.0|This is a great one for Marilyn, Lauren and Betty!  Though they all had their own appeal, they were able to sparkle together and each have their own great moments on screen.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I have been a fan of Karl Urban for a while now. I did not expect Dredd to be one of those movies I would like; much less one I would write a review about. I watched John Carter before I watched Dredd, and while it was barely just an ok movie, I enjoyed the ending of John Carter more than I did the entire movie which I found to be bizzare and unusual. Dredd on the other hand is a different case entirely.<br /><br />In 2012, we had 3 really BIG comic book movies to come out during the summer. The highly anticipated team up of Marvel's The Avengers, The epic conclusion to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series, and The surprisingly exceptionally well put together reboot of spider man entitled: The Amazing Spider Man. So naturally, I did not initially hear or know a thing about Dredd being made into a movie.<br /><br />Dredd stars Karl Urban as the title character himself. Supporting cast consists of Olivia Thirlby as Judge Anderson (expect a surprise with her character), Lena Headey as the main antagonist, Ma-Ma (funny name I know) and Wood Harris as Kay. The Cast both main and supporting did a terrific job, and more notably, Karl Urban really surprised me playing the lead character in the movie.<br /><br />The story line is good and easy to follow. There is a lot of action (fast paced and slow motion); and too, the effects work really well for the movie.<br /><br />To compare Dredd to other movies: its like Daredevil, Crank with Jason Statham, and Wanted all in one movie. Dredd is not a mercenary but he is fearless and committed. Dredd does not disregard the law, but he executes it by any means necessary.<br /><br />I will again admit that I did not expect to like Dredd as much as I did. I was shocked to see that it got such rave reviews and yet there is not a confirmed sequel. But nonetheless, as a comic book adaptation, and more importantly as a movie, Dredd does succeed.<br /><br />Lets just hope that soon, in the not too far off future, that this great movie gets the sequel it deserves.<br /><br />4.5 Starsgets the sequel it deserves.<br /><br />4.5 Stars
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|My granddaughter didn't enjoy this as much as some of the other makeup and style games.  All you did in this one was the hair.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Not worth the time.  This movie seemed like an excuse to have Evengers fight eachother.  This should have been a full hour shorter movie.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|If you can only read one book on socio-political history and economics, read this one.<br /><br />The authors consider Extractive exclusive societies where an elite monopolizes political powers to create \\"extractive economic institutions...designed to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset\\" (p76). Such societies become stagnant as the ruling elite is threatened by innovation and changes and thus prevents these. They contrast such Extractive societies with Inclusive societies, where political power is shared to create \\"inclusive economic institutions\\" designed to \\"allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people... to best use their talents and skills ...to make the choices they wish...secure private property...provision a level playing field ...and...permit the entry of new businesses....\\". These sharp distinctions between Extractive and Inclusive institutions explain the huge contrast between prosperity in South Korea, vs. the bleak backwardness of North Korea; or the dividing lines between the Spanish vs. British colonies in the Americas....<br /><br />Arguably, it may also explain the contrast between the stagnation of Detroit and the prosperity of its suburbs. Here too, a ruling \\"elite\\" group of politicians and union leaders, created extractive economic institutions, to extract income and wealth from the middle class, causing massive flight to the suburbs, where economic and  political institutions have been inclusive.<br /><br />This book should be a required reading for all politicians and government bureaucrats.
B000I3UAJ0|3.0|I'm more a fan of TNG, but got this movie so that I could see all of TOS movies.  The movies that come later are much better, although this one is better than a lot of the stuff you see out now.
0545586178|5.0|Well this is my first book review. And just to be clear: Yes I have read The Hunger Games, and yes I have seen the movie. I was instantly hooked  after reading the book and the movie Exceeded my expectations as an adaptation. I think Jennifer Lawrence is excellent and well chosen to play Katniss.<br /><br />You know there are days when the sky is blue, and then we have days of rain and storms. In Catching Fire it takes place a year after Katniss and Peeta changed the games forever. I will not go really deep into to detail because Catching Fire is such a good book that it would be ridiculous for me to spoil this story for those who have not read it.<br /><br />Basically things are not quite the same ever since Katniss and Peeta's victory. Yes they have won, and both their lives are better than they previously were, but there is an unmistakable dislike of the way things are by The Leader of the the Capitol President Snow. He does not like that Katniss has encouraged people in the Capitol to resist and rebel. And therefore he sets some things into motion and just when you think things are already weird and you fast forward a few chapters, something unmistakingly unusual happens. And things are not just weird, but things get REAL. Catching Fire has vivid description, extremely good use of advanced vocabulary, and great characterization. I also like the overall tone and theme that this book has. And fortunately for all the people that read this review, English was a class I excelled in so I will break it down further in parts.<br /><br />The exposition is a lot like I thought it would be; But expect even more surprises than the first book; both good and bad.<br /><br />The Rising action is intense, suspenseful, and more time consuming than a lot of books,(once it reaches this point, you will not want to put this book down)<br /><br />The Climax is shocking and unpredictable<br /><br />And towards the unforgettable conclusion, just like that Katniss Everdeen and her Mockinjay become the new beacon of hope.<br /><br />You'll just have to read Mockingjay for the Resolution.<br /><br />My Consenus for Catching Fire: EVERYONE Should Read Itnjay become the new beacon of hope.<br /><br />You'll just have to read Mockingjay for the Resolution.<br /><br />My Consenus for Catching Fire: EVERYONE Should Read It

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game. can't wait for more levels to come out. . Keep them coming! had a blast playing against my husband
B0092S4WLY|4.0|i would actually like to give this game 4.5 stars, but I can't. This game is BETTER than 100 floors, because you can move around on each floor. I had no idea that this was just a preview or sample of the full game because the quality was wonderful! Way to go Dozengames.com!!!! KEEP IT UP :)<br />  My one and only complaint is that whenever I exit the game, then get back on later, all my progress is lost on that one level. However, this is sometimes good and you can use it to your advantage.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Very intense a good story I think should be shared I thought a very good performance by franco glad I watched this
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writing is great and they picked perfect characters. Good amount of humor and drama.  Always want to watch more!

B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|79.56mb. Cannot move to SD. Only reason for the 4 stars. 5 when movable. I haven't played it yet, so I can't truly comment on the game itself. I'm not hurting for space, but this is an important permission for an app of this magnitude. Js
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Blu-ray is the only way to watch this movie. The intro with the fly-byes of the Alps, unbelievable. Julie Andrews at her best. Christopher Plummer, fantastic. A must see, even if you don't like musicals. This just might be our, new, family favorite. A movie from when movies had plots, actors and heart (and no CG).
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Great book....  a lot of good insight and it all makes sense. Easy read an  it touches on some really great points.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entertaining. Sexy characters. Has a little of everything in it. Hard to put down. Look forward to the next book.
B001EN71CW|5.0|i am a Huge fan of this series.  Blue ray looks amazing. Would highly recommend to any fan of the show.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|A good movie and a fresh look at an old classic. The way the story unfolded was a little weak, but there were some good laughs and some really good effect. One question though, Where are the lady giants?
0345350499|5.0|i watched the movie version first while the book was being delivered to my home because i was afraid i wouldn't be able to understand the book so well. but the book version is much more detailed and makes more sense (explains everything: the characters' thoughts, the reasons for their actions, etc.). thanks for selling this book because it's the cheapest price i can ever get.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game entertained me for hours. It's really fun and addictive. I now know several ways to escape a room. Lol.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|The book was amazing. I did not want to stop reading it, its a really good book you should read it :)
0062209493|5.0|what a great book about a great hero.  I had no idea what happened to him after he wrote the book till i finished listen to this. Hopefully i didnt spoil it here. Read the book or &#34;Listen&#34; like i did and be amazed and what a true hero is. Then google search him and get sad.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|interesting story about human failings and redemption. decent special effects & hot witches. what more do you need in a movie?
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Cast of classic action film stars, some still working it and some seemingly need to hang it up. There was a lot of shoot 'me up bang bang which I expected in the film. I thought it was cheesy when the characters used each other's trademark phrases \\"I'll be back\\" only works in Terminator. I don't need Stallone to say it. Jason Statham (sp) is pretty awesome.  I am a fan of all of these guys' movies so would still watch these, even with cheesy lines.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a great game so awesodme love rigureing it out soooooooo cccccooaooollll oooooohhh yeah thebbesttnlove the game get it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|lots of fun. good story line.  I liked the puzzles. and I liked the different rooms in the game.  good puzzles for people to solve
1607066017|5.0|i had a friend tell me about this series and how great it was. I waiting till this Vol. 1 came out so i could get the first 5 books in one and what a great read. Amazing story and characters. I actually just got VOl 2 in the mail the other day. So if your reading this and thinking about it i say pull the trigger and get the first two Volumes, you wont be disappointed.

B0095MVOMC|4.0|I loved this exciting treasure hunt kind of game. All the images were so beautiful and numbers were placed so nicely I just loved hunting for them. Thanks to Amazon for making it free yesterday. Some levels were easy and some not but I couldn't keep it down. Finished all levels in just a day.

B00CATSONE|2.0|Its message was less important than exposing Edison & J.P Morgan.  Things done to prevent progress.  The message of imagination was less important than exploitation. The cream does not get rewarded for their great ideas.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. I could not put it down. I hope book 3 is half as good. Suzanne Collins had earned a fan with this work.

B004SEUIWO|5.0|I have seen Chicago on stage three times -- once in a regional theater and twice on Broadway.  The show is great on the stage, but it does not compare to the film.  The film, Chicago, is the best of them all.  The performances are flawless and the rendition of the great songs of this show are musically, vocally, and visually memorable.  This is a great show and a great movie.
0786868694|5.0|This book was one of a series of her books we acquired, love them all, it's Nigella what's not to love?
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game that gets boring after a while<br />4 out of 5 stars<br />NOTE: it is almost impossible to complete all the goals without purchasing in game currency
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have only watched a very shows of Season1 and became hooked after the first show! I have to limit myself to a couple at a time, as I want to know what happens next.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've only seen the recent movie but wow book is so awewsome..it takes some time to read but worth it :)!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|game does nnot open or load..... this is the third time I tried loading it to my kindle and it keeps saying cannot connect to server...the only game I have issues with...I still have yet to open the game and play it.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|just rewashed riffs and power chords  ozzy sounds whiny and thats with good studio recordings. waste of money  get old sabbath
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is fun but can be bordering at times there is not much to stay though you will enjoy this
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book really resonated with me. I true  read in  it a few months ago and find  get into it, but picked it up again and read it in one sitting. Amazing character and voice.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the book but seriously it should have been longer instead of making us wait....guess the waiting game begins again
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|Let me say first up that the FX-8320 or 8350 from AMD is probably a better value at the moment, I just managed to snag this for $219. I'm still on the stock cooler and clock (water cooling system is shipping), and it's taken everything I've thrown at it, including 6th generation console emulation, like the GameCube and the Playstation 2 at full speed and with enhanced graphics. While other processors might be a better value, if you get this one, you will not be disappointed.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Another \\"must hear at least once before you die\\" album.  There is a track for any body's tastes although \\"Crosstown Traffic\\", \\"Voodoo Chile\\", \\"All along the Watchtower\\" and \\"House Burnin Down\\" were the most popular when it came out.  \\"1983\\" just didn't the air time.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is so fun it is like temple run oz ( fun ) it is not the best but it is fun.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|lots of action - good escape movie.  I don't think a sequel will be necessary though. Fun movie to watch
1416550550|5.0|I am a veracious reader. This book has made it into my top 5. I struggled with the time travel but Morton did a superb job of keeping me straight. A wonderful read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I expected to love this book, but was disappointed - did not like the main characters.  The plot was good in that it kept you wondering who was the &#34;bad guy&#34; and it was very well written.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|I enjoyed the performance and music of this movie version of the Phantom of the Opera.  I went to the Broadway Musical only after I saw the movie version.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its great for problem solving. my 10 year old loves it. she spent an hour playing it and then I did.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Easy to download videos and play them when ever you want. I downlaod the videos before going to gym as I don't have good at&t signal at gym:)
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I liked this book although I thought it was a bit slow in spots.  Baldacci is one of my favorites and he always has a good story to tell.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|John Corey is saracastic, funny and smart.  Mr DeMille is an excellent author. I look forward to more from this series
125000098X|5.0|I learned a great deal more about the Nazi era than I have from other material. I won't spoil it for new readers. I share my books with another reader to lessen the cost of new books. Now she likes girly type books. Yet we both enjoyed this one. I look forward to the next chapters in the characters stories. One needn't have read the first book to enjoy the second.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool draws you in and doesn't let you go until the end, plus leaves you wanting more. And the Kindle price is a bargain!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great movie. Likely to recommend it to anybody. Loved the action and adventure in an old story like this. Watch it.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I bought this product when it was a lightning deal...$80 for the whole series is awesome! Imagine my disappointment when I open the box set and see that Season 1 Disc 4 is missing! I know I paid only a fraction of the original price but I didn't know that meant only getting a fraction of the discs! The slits for the DVDs do not seems very practical since there is no padding, but I can't complain too much since I paid so little. I still wish I had that missing DVD though and you don't know that you're missing one until you open it and then can't return it for another, more complete, set. I guess I will have to watch those missing episodes on instant video. Good thing I am a prime member so its free...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I did not watch the series when it originally aired. I was planning some long air travel and since so many of my friends had enjoyed it, I decided to purchase all three seasons to watch on my computer. Since I was not sure whether I would like it or not; I initially just purchased Season 1. I was hooked from the beginning! Some episodes I viewed via my Amazon Video library; some I downloaded to have available when I did not have Internet connection. Now I have to wait until January for the Series to resume on PBS. I am sure I will just go back to the beginning and watch it all over again! Purchasing, and viewing are so easy. But save some money and buy all three in a package!!
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Sounds great, very reminiscent of the Sabatoge era.  This was a very inspired release, and while not the best Black Sabbath album ever, it is definitely on the short list.  Of course Bill Ward decided to sit this one out and although the session drummer (Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine fame) is a competent rock drummer, this work does miss something with him not participating.  I wish it could have been a complete reunion, but this may be as close as we get and if turns out to be Sabbath's true swan song, then what a finale it is!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The puzzles themselves are well done and I enjoyed them but the game should be twice this long even for the price.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I'm exceptionally tech savvy and have years of IT experience.  This device is a waste and I returned it while vacationing. We bought it to help monitor our kids while being supervised by a new and never-tested local nanny service. I thank God that the local service has been exceptional as the Withings just, well, sucks! I did everything by the book and re-read all \\"instructions\\" in total.  The thing just doesn't work.  \\"Registering\\" online does nothing for my device connectivity but does create a new SPAM string. So... yea for that.<br /><br />I don't believe ANY of the positive reviews.  I tried Bluetooth and wi-fi and, even after registering directly on their site, got a DEAD monitor.  Sure, it lit up and beeped but never displayed my sleeping children.<br /><br />Please, do NOT even attempt to work with Withings.  They just suck.  Further, their app absolutely SUCKS and I'm shocked they're still in business.<br /><br />FYI: Amazon refunded my money BEFORE Withings even received the unit back from me.  THAT should tell you something.  Amazon should DROP this snake-oil product.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great movie for ALL ages, got it so my grannies could watch it when they come to visit...Also a favorite of mine.
B00C16NWUG|5.0|Excellent cast and director in this award winning movie I just love  this accurate adaptation of the musical phenomenom of les miserables
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game for all ages with many outcomes for each game you have to use your spider brain to get to the finish line
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The music is very good, famous, catchy songs all brought together in a movie.  Great idea. I liked every song and every part of it.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Love the Iron man movies and Robert Downy Jr. He has really changed for his first appearance in the movies'
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|I get more compliments on this case.  Love the color.  It is easy to put on and doesn't cover any of the openings.  I gave it four instead of five stars because I would like it to be a little more protective of my phone.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing spider.  It goes fast and I can win enough to enjoy it but not enough to get bored.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love all the different sound options and how you are able to combine them with different volumes for each sound too. Like I want my thunder louder than my wind. You can also save your combinations to easily access them later. I also love the sleep timer and the option to close the app once the timer goes off.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book is a great read for both men and women.  It opens the discussion of how much more we can all accomplish and how much happier we could all be if we supported each other in our goals both personally and professionally.
1781162646|5.0|I had to throw my two cents in despite the many reviews already posted here. As a long-time fan of Stephen King, I enjoy his ability to quickly develop believable characters and plot. This book does not disappoint, and it crosses into the mystery genre, which is another bonus. Highly recommended.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed the book because I learned about history.  The author was talented by mixing new and old to tell her story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of those books that stays with you.. Different tales but interconnected - like branches from the same tree. I'll read everything he writes!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a Very well written Book. I could feel everyone's struggles. Great read, now I need to watch the movie.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw this extraordinary musical a few days before the Tony Awards..from the first moment to the last, I was entranced. This show is unique, and this CD lets me relive every minute of how much I enjoyed myself that night. I read that there is a lottery to get tickets to the show now..I think anyone who is waiting for tickets, or anyone who wants a CD with upbeat, incredible music should buy this CD immediately. You will not be disappointed!
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|It was a little tedious that essentially the entire season was a story arc that required seeing each episode, but it was interesting.  At least it didn't end like Voyager's Year of Hell..., so it didn't feel such a waste.
B0073U2FB2|2.0|I saw the trailer for this film a few years ago, and it seemed a little different that most other alien invasion movies that your used to seeing.  I bought this movie for a couple bucks to satisfy my own curiosity.  I really wasn't missing much.  The story development just kind of speeds right along without much deliberation.  The characters were able to figure out quite a bit about these alien creatures that nobody knew anything about, in a pretty short period of time.  Also, it's sooooo convenient that apparently, EVERYBODY in Russia speaks fluent English, especially the electrical engineer who has already managed to build a weapon that these creatures are vulnerable to, unlike bullets.  Otherwise, it would have been a lot tougher to communicate with so many foreign strangers.<br /><br />Like most alien movies, this one just falls apart towards the end.  Perhaps it's harder to write a sci-fi story that's not completely ridiculous, than I had previously thought.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I was told I would love this movie because I like the Bourne Movies, Mission Impossible, etc.  But I was kinda disappointed because so much was made up... oh well.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I read a lot of fiction and so I generally can stomach some less than amazing fiction.  However I couldn't even make it through the book (I got about 25% through).  The characters where cliche and weak.  The plot was stereotypical and badly put together.  I liken this book to a billboard of the grand canyon.  Flat and boring and not the real thing.  I write this not to be picky or mean but people need to know that what they are buying is not the quality they are looking for.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is just an all around good game. I'm better at the physics stuff than I thought I would be, so that makes it even more fun.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is a story of a girl who makes the world of difference to a man who makes a wold of difference to her, but in ways you would never expect.  This story could be yours or mine - who knows. Reading takes you into a world of possibilities and allows you into experiences you may one day have to deal with.  Perhaps rehearsing emotions through the power of the written text would prepare you for the time it becomes real.  This is a very real story.  I loved every minute of it. It is written in modern language for a modern generation.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I have enjoyed this product. It makes getting on you tube easy and fun. If you like you tube you will like the downloader.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This season was as interesting as the last two. I don't think there was quite as much history in this season. The historical connections are what distinguish this series from a soap. I really like the history involved. They killed off some major characters, so now I'm looking forward to seeing what they do to fill the void next season.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like the very large variety of sounds but wish there was a way to set a timer and set volume on individual sounds. I use another app but set it for 30 minutes only instead of letting it run all night. Some sounds overpower others so I can set the level on each. If this app were able to do that, I would probably use it instead.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The music was great and the characters were somewhat believable.  It dragged a bit at first but it was a sweet story with a nice ending.
630575067X|5.0|this one is the best of the first three (prequels) i believe. considering &#34;a more civilized time&#34; the other of the prequels didnt expand much on that theme.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love the critical thinking skills part and what is required to finally find the solution. Overall a great game to play
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I don't play this often now but did well in the beginning. There are a few that I am totally stuck on and have to move on but overall I like it and would recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I try to get into my account and it says I can't get in. So I go to forgot my password and use that and it says that account is already in use. Really frustrating. Uuuuuugggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this gAME I PLAY ON MY PHONE AS WELL. PLS ADD TINK087 AND LITBIT087. GIFE EVER DAY. if u want two gifts a day then u should add me
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love the cast. Love Megan. Love the show. Nothing better than a big Broadway production. I especially enjoyed &#34;Our Day will Come&#34; and &#34;Another Opening&#34; numbers. Showstoppers!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Along the lines of cut the rope, this game really makes you think ahead of the moves you're going to do. Some are more challenging than others for sure.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Having an emotional or vested interest in the characters makes for a fast read. Book is clearly written for young adults with a compelling enough story to hold the interest of a wider audience. I love the gene.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|The special effects on BluRay look fantastic, it starts off in Black and White, but white the color comes on it's Beautiful<br />Good acting and Very good looking Witches :)
1881273377|5.0|Clear, concise information that can be applied in an any & all relationships.  I recommend this CD/book to parents, couples & those entering into marriage.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. I upgraded to the Mako and it's a lot more challenging with the bombs, those horrible fish with lights on their heads and more jellyfish. Sometimes I die in a minute, ugh. I like to skim across the top and eat the birds, and slide up on the docks to eat those crazy people. Recently the game did an update and then I saw a GIANT crab which I'm trying to get. It never gets boring and there are always surprises around every corner. Really, you have to get this game!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app really is a great way to pass the time and really get your mind thinking hard and on different levels. Needs more than ten levels tho! But otherwise great app!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is a very good concert, with a good mix of Eagles' and solo music.  I miss Don Felder's guitar, but another former Eagle, Timothy B Schmidt, seems to have taken his place.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|The costumes, the songs, the acting - all great entertainment !!  Watch it with your pet cat.  Makes a nice gift for cat lovers.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I'm loving this app! I made some cool designs and use them for my facebook cover pic. I tried emailing it to myself but they're too big, even with reducing the size. So I share it to facebook privately so only I can see it and then use it for a cover pic when I'm ready. Long full length finger swipes remind me of flowing scarves.  And now with the update you can use your own pic as a background to add pertiness to it. I haven't used it much but like the possibilities.
B00AJMQSP0|5.0|Helloween! How the hell did I miss this band growing up? They have everything that gets my blood pumping. Great music soaring vocals, just enough heaviness to keep it interesting without going overboard into full on chugga chugga metal.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|very nice! now I normally don't bother with covers, but I'm a fan of both Cole and Benson, so I was expecting it to be good. And I wasn't let down!!!! Benson does a great job covering the songs, and he has a few guest stars, which add to the flavor of the album. (such as Wynton Marsalis, Judith Hill and Sheila E). Very well done.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It buffered a little, but tht was because it was HD. I just won't view the HD Series next time.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Such a fun and challenging game. When I win a hard game I shake my head and think &#34;how did I do that?&#34; Some are so easy but others are very hard. I've had to resort to the super powers occasionally. Definitely recommend.
B00003CX9W|5.0|If you are looking for a second release film that was NOTmade over sea's this film from this dealer is the real deal. I had made contact with the seller and they assured me that this was not the Korean knock off. Dealer is honest and true to their word, fast shipping. I will buy from this dealer again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show!  It is one of the best written and acted shows that I have ever watched on television.  The ending was a tear-jerker, but I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with the characters next season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so fun because you can buy minions and it gets really hard my high score is 19,490 awesome it is awesome
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Got this as a free app. Love the different backgrounds and many games to choose from. Mahjong is a nice relaxing no-brainer activity and it gives me something to do when I don't want to think too hard ;-)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have tried to merge my guest account to my Facebook account but it didn't work, I can't get anyone to help.  Why are the power up so much for so little? But, it's fun to play.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I think this is the best game I have on my Nexus 7. It looks great, it plays great, and is a lot of fun.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I enjoy action pictures which this is one......The characters were great some of the weapons were extreme, but overall great entertainment.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|This is fun but takes some kind of skill I don't think I have ;-) It's just a little challenging for me but I do like the fun characters and the story line. Not giving up yet!
B00701L5XS|5.0|I've always stuck with three or four knots that I learned as a kid, mostly for fishing, so having this app in my pocket to pull out and reference anytime is great. The visuals are easy to follow and the list is exhaustive, so I've yet to come across a situation that couldn't be tied down with ease.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|This movie cracked us up!  The sarcastic &#34;Paul&#34; is very funny and by the end of the movie you love the little guy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very engrossing novel.  I enjoyed the time travel from the early days of this family in Afghanistan, to the present day.  It was very apropos to what is going on in the country.  I think that it helped to understand the problems and pressures that Afghanis suffer, even those that spent most of their life outside of the country.  Very engrossing.  Kept me interested in the book from beginning to end.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|This is my second Finis mp3 player.  I had the original Swimp3 and loved it.  I tried to save money this time and first bought one of the lower priced swim headsets.  Never even got as far as the pool, just did not work.  So I decided to go back to the Finis brand and  am totally happy with my decision.  It is completely user friendly as far as loading with music and operating once in the pool.  It's comfortable to wear and the sound quality in the water is great.  Totally recommend this product for anyone who wants to liven up their laps.
0071752854|5.0|I've read a lot of books on persuasion, influence and sales over the years (&#34;SPIN Selling&#34; being my favorite until now), so I was eager to dig into this after a friend recommended it, especially since that friend is the most gifted deal maker and closer I've ever known.<br /><br />Klaff's model is great because he's broken it down into learnable steps that don't rely on you being a cult of personality that has owned rooms since you were in diapers.<br /><br />The two biggest techniques that I learned and have used with great success are:<br />1. Always Be Leaving: Instead of &#34;Always Be Closing&#34;, he shows how walking away is the best position to be in and it has turned the table in my favor every time I've used it.<br /><br />2. Be lighthearted with the control you gain in a deal. I've always struggled with coming off like a jerk when I get the upper-hand on guys that are prototypical egomaniacs, so Klaff's numerous examples of how he keeps the control light and non-offensive was great for me to see and then work to implement. I'm still refining the approach, but it has definitely kept me from creating any unnecessary drama so far.<br /><br />There are far more nuggets in the book and I'd recommend it for anyone that has to convince others of taking action on anything.
B0019FWIEQ|5.0|Anything with John Cusack works for us.  Through in Morgan Freeman and there was no way this wasn't going to be a good movie.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|The movie on this site will not play on a tablet which to me is stupid.  Update your stuff so everyone can enjoy it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was one of the most inspirational books I have read. If I could I would give it ten stars. Thank you whoever wrote this for this wonderful book.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I loved the fact that this book was simple and complex and the same time.  I couldn't put it down!  I will be reading more books by this gifted author.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|I have tried 3 times to download this stupid game.......<br />I gave up. I would love to play it but you know it wont download
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|This is a well done movie, and it honors the original Wizard of Oz by beginning in Black and White. James Franco does overact a little, but that is his character... so well done.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the digital copy... since I think it is a download, not a disc... but I typically don't use those anyway. If they are like the original digital copies, they last one year ( can you say ripoff?) and it is more of a lost leader like grocery stores used to used and still do in some cases. Sure, there is piracy out there, but I'm guessing if you pirate, you've already figured out the way around this... so only the regular consumer suffers. and now back to the movie:<br /><br />It is filmed for 3D effects, but the colors are great, Mila Kunis is beautiful through most of the movie, Zach Braff continues to be hilarious, and it is very enjoyable. The flying monkeys are more aggressive than in the original, but again, maybe that is what today's audience is needing.<br />They reminded me of the apes from the remake of Planet of the apes.<br />anyway, it is safe for kids of a certain age, worth seeing, and worth owning.
B007QPFGJW|1.0|Rarely do I stop reading a book, and I had heard enough about this author to buy this one.  I'm sorry to say that while he may be able to write well ( and I will try another one) his choice of story and subject matter for 'Phantom' is just about as dark and degrading as anything I've ever read.  Perhaps he's angry with the way drugs are controlled -- or not -- in his country, but this is just hideous and out of any realm of 'pleasure reading' imangineable. Just plain awful!
B0045INOCO|2.0|A go-no-where story about a pivotal time in US history. Acted well but mostly unbelievable ( i was there). Pick another movie to enjoy. I know this is supposed to be a &#34;cult classic&#34; but don't waste your time. For a better picture of that time try &#34;Full Metal Jacket&#34;
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I refer to &#34;The Four Agreements&#34; many times. It is a wonderful tool. this book is a treasure when things just seem out of control in the life.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Pre ordered the RAM album because of my love for Daft Punk. When I first heard it I was a bit confused but by the 4th listen I was very impressed. Each track is special and the harmonious blend of sounds is quite special. Must order for anyone who is a fan of EDM.
B00CATSONE|4.0|An interesting read. This book gives a look at part of the development of electricity and the role of politics and wealth in it.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Love Halestorm! Best CD yet. I'd love to see them live. You need to see Lzzy and Amy Lee from Evanescence sing Break In live.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|For any Phantom fan, this is extraordinary!  I saw Love Never Dies (Phantom played by Ramin Karimloo) when it opened in London and it was lovely and heart wrenching at the same time.  I'm hoping that it makes a tour in the US soon and will see it again and again.
B005K17RU0|1.0|It isn't very legible.  It isn't easy to know how to use.  It isn't very appealing.  How do I remove it?
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|My husband watched this movie several months ago when we first got the DVD and found it beautiful to look at, but very confusing. We watched it last night and put on the English subtitles be cause when they go back and forth with accents and dialects of English, we initially got a little lost. put on the close-caption and it was great.<br />It's a complex story, but I think it boils down to a line that is repeated in the film about all our lives touching, over and over--in ways we can't even foresee, good ways and bad. I will definitely watch it again... with subtitles on.
B0026PA05M|5.0|Love Halestorm! This CD is great but I'd say The Strange Case of ... is a little better. I'd love to see them live!
0345529057|5.0|It's a normal quality, no problem for reading. The shipping was fast and the product is okay. For this price, is a great choice.
B005GP7F8Y|3.0|Although it says Blu-Ray DVD it needs a complete remastering to bring it Up to Par with true Blu-ray as the colors are faded and the details are poor in this addition.  Very sloppy job.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I can't even begin to describe this movie. It's definitely an epic story with lots of details and only one viewing will not justify all the work that has been put into this movie. There's so many details and clues that connect to each other, thus a second round will make you appreciate this cinematographic work. I didn't expect anything out of this movie when I saw the trailer, because it was rather boring but this nearly three hour long story didn't bore me at all. I am intrigued to read the book.Tom Hanks was just Ok.
B008M7JODC|5.0|The title says it all really. I don't know where to even start except to say: watch it! This show has some of the best character story's and actors. The story line is incredible and leaves so much room for growing. It's also the only show I've seen with graphics that rival that of big screen movies. All in all, this is a show I recommend to all my friends, so what do you think I'd say to you?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is like the only game I play so well I'm addicted to it oh well I love it and you all should get it.
B000068OCS|5.0|This is a great documentary movie by Francis Ford Copula that I enjoyed the cinematic affects and shooting of this movie and especially sound rack recording are great a must see to get a perspective on our society.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a very creative movie. The music throughout the movie only increases the deepness of the story. The end is open for the viewer to keep dreaming. I enjoyed L. DiCaprio's perfomance very much. This is definitely one of my top movies to watch.
B00942G4UA|5.0|The food industry in the US is deplorable !  The European countries are so much more concerned with public health.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|The Cut the Rope games just keep getting better and better!!! I love this game, it is super fun and I am addicted.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|My wife and I enjoy Tom Selleck movies.  The Jesse Stone series are a-little slow; but, we have the full set and enjoyed watching them.  If you like Tom Selleck or slower paced detective movie, you should like these.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish I could get an update with bigger world please otherwise it was fine when is the update thank you
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I really enjoyed the story's plot and action.  The characters were well thought out!  Another good job by Rick Riordan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this app is awesome in fact I have to brothers who always take my Kindle Fire HD and play it when I'm not around and I'm pretty sure they love this app more than I do! I definitely am giving this app 5 stars for its awesomeness. I also saw both Despicable Mes and I loved them. In this app I think it's so cool that there are vector levels! I hope they will continue to make Despicable Me movies and apps!
B005LAII8A|2.0|Could have found a good old time movie for 5 dollars or less at big lots that would have been just as good to watch the wife likes shootem up movies and she thought it was so bad she fell asleep.  special effects if that is what you want to call it was poor and unrealistic or just hard to believe.  The so called time travel chamber seem to be just a big pot with nothing to control it just step in and go.  well dont want to tell you the movie but it will fill in the time when there is nothing but reruns on...
B007QDNKQA|5.0|It has a great story , good acting, very well done effects and accuracy of the equipment being used.<br />would watch it again.
0385474547|4.0|This is the story of a village in Nigeria, told mostly through the tale of Okonkwo, a self-made man who rose above the disgrace of his lazy father in order to achieve respect, wealth, and personal recognition.  The book describes what day-to-day life is like in this village dominated by yam farming, with strict religious beliefs and tradition.  Okonkwo is rigid in his life and follows closely the rules of his tribe, even when those rules lead to his being exiled for years.  He seems to be one of the few who senses danger when missionaries move in, build a church, and steamroll over the village's traditions.<br /><br />I really liked reading about how this tribe functioned, and it was nice to read about it from an insider's perspective, which made all of the differences from my own culture and ways of understanding the world seem more logical.  I appreciated that this story didn't talk down to its audience or over-explain what was going on.  I would have liked a bit more closure at the end, though, and more insight into what Okonkwo and the others in his tribe were thinking.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ordered this for my grandson, but sort of took over when he got stuck.  I found it handy to keep some scratch paper nearby.  Good fun!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I love Stargate Atlantis.  It is a series that can be suspenseful and adventurous.  I drop everything to watch this show.  It just has everything that I am looking in a show.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is easy to play with different levels and layouts. Hours of fun. You won't go wrong with this Mahjong game app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great running game and the minions are adorable just starting...hopefully I won't be required to purchase anything. collecting bananas is good for me
B00007E7K0|5.0|Not much to say its a lens cap. But shipped quick. Price was ok. If you want a canon cap and not a generic one this is the one.
B00969PR18|1.0|Did not keep.  Was not what I was looking for.  Did not meet my needs.  Was too elementary for me.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|Mr Hackman did a great job and Danny GLover also. I love movies based on truth I woul recommend this to anyone
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|I saw 5SOS with One Direction almost a month ago and I order this CD a day after. I could not get over how talented these guys are! I am so pleased with the CD, and I really cannot wait for when we can actually buy more of their music in the US. Thank you to whoever sold this to me, and I hope that whoever orders one next enjoys it as much as I do! I would suggest this to anyone who is into new music! They are very modern with a great, new sound!
B004HZXORA|5.0|If you are a die hard fan of Star Wars and have seen every Episode at the movie theater then this review is not for you.<br /><br />I did not see the other badly done reproductions that others have commented on that I almost considered buying but never did because of the bad reviews.<br /><br />I bought this for the family to see the whole saga and I did not see any issues with the reproduction.  I have not even watched the bonus discs so can't review those.<br /><br />Watched with the following equipment:<br />TV: 57\\" LG (60hz)<br />Samsung Blue Ray Player
B007BT0RKG|3.0|This was good but not what I was looking for at the time.  I still might go back and pick up again
B001QWBM62|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of equipment.<br /><br />I bough it to use it as a sound recording portable device for shooting videos on DSLRs and I ended using it for recording almost everything.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B005NACC6M TASCAM DR-40 4-Track Portable Digital Recorder]] is similar but cheaper but in my opinion the zoom H4N is sturdier and better for unfriendly use.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|I love playing with these figures with my grand daughter. They keep us busy for hours.<br />Everything about Sofia, the story the figures -- have lessons to teach our kids.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I think I have all of the Eliane Elias recordings so far. If not , I will get them.<br />Although perhaps not quite as intoxicating a voice as Elis Regina or her daughter, Maria Rita, Eliana has the additional gift of playing piano as well as anyone in Brazilian<br />music. Interspersing vocals with instrumentals is lovely and wonderful. You cannot go wrong with any of her recordings.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is such a fun game. It is fun for all ages to play. My older brother even likes it!
B000FC13MM|4.0|I love going back to this series. Whenever I want to go back to the Old Kingdom, I can, now that I have the Kindle. Great read!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Should have been much better with a cast of Hanks and Berry.<br />Missed the mark as a quality scifi, and using that goofy language made me think of the wild Thornberries. LOL
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Seriously fun way to look at the whole zombie 'phenomenon'. Can't say too much without spoilers but it was a very enjoyable movie!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am addicted to you game. It is so much fun I can't put it down. I would recommend it to my friends.
B001NLKT60|5.0|After reading 'tatoo' I had to continue. If the background information is true I never realized the Swedes were such a corrupt people and my paternal grandparents are swedes. Anyway liked the series found some of it a little absurd.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Dr Davis presented valuable points backed up with research. Eating healthy is difficult today, as evidenced by how GMO wheat, although now produced conviently by chemical companies for large agribusiness, has morphed into a dangerous 'franken food'. This both an interesting read and a must read for anyone concerned about their food.
0688014291|4.0|Definitely one of those books which you need to read, over and over again, in order to keep your management skills sharp.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I absolutely love doodle jump, and loved it even more when they came out with the ninja setting. One reason I loved it was because you could get coins and then buy upgrades. This version does NOT HAVE COINS. I thought you guys should know. They should add the coins.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is very addicting I absolutely love it &lt;3 not a scam or a joke and very kid friendly
0670026603|5.0|I loved this book, and couldn't put it down.<br />Was a bit of a tear jerker but also a fabulous story with a few laughs.<br />I didn't want it to finish
B00B19GKI0|5.0|They don't make them like this these days. Carpenter at his best, behind the camera and writing the music. Love the cast too. Kurt Russel, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, and Donald &#34;Dr. Loomis&#34; Pleasance! Watch Escape from LA for a follow up laugh. Not nearly as great as the original. But fun nonetheless.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I've waited a while to write a review of this CD because I wanted to give it a chance to grow on me, to see if I could make an informed judgment about a band that I enjoy a lot.<br />I think its fair to say that Black Sabbath's 13 is good album that spanks what passes for \\"rock\\" these days, but in the context of the entire band's entire catalog, there are some issues that keep this from being \\"the greatest Sabbath album ever.\\" Most of my observations hold with what other reviewers have brought up as the albums high points and low points.<br />First and foremost, this is absolutely a Black Sabbath release. The Black Sabbath name has been used on some pretty questionable stuff over the years, mostly due to record labels not letting Tony Iommi release a solo or side project. Some Sabbath CDs simply aren't Sabbath and they were never intended to be; luckily this isn't Seventh Star or Forbidden. Tempo and tone wise it falls very much in line with the Heaven and Hell's \\"Devil You Know\\" and Geezer Butler's solo project. Its slow tempo, heavy and percussive. Unfortunately a lot of Sabbath's original blues influences only show up on the track Damaged Soul, which I think is my favorite. A lot of the energy on their early releases and Dehumanizer is also missing. Black Sabbath was never known for long songs so I was surprised to find so many of the tracks clocking in around 6 to 7 minutes. Personally I would have preferred shorter songs since the tend to border on repetitive.<br />A lot of comment has been made about this \\"reunion\\" CD missing the key ingredient of Bill Ward. There are only 4, maybe 5 if you include Sharon Osborne, people that know what the real problem was that prevented him from being on this CD. Whatever the issue, given the age and health of the members, they really should have just fixed whatever the problems were and moved on. If Bill wanted more money, give it to him. Why? So everyone in the world doesn't constantly bring it up. All that aside, Brad Wilkdoes a great job as a fill in. He is a talented and versatile drummer that imitates Ward's grove pretty well; something Bill should have kept in mind when negotiating with the band over this record.<br />The worst performance on the CD is Ozzy. The man will turn 65 by the end of 2013, lived a hard life that has put a lot of miles on his pipes, so its not surprising that his voice isn't very dynamic anymore. People try to blame Rick Rubin, but if you listen to Ozzy's most recent releases you can year the same straining and reliance on post production that is present on 13. I love the man and what he has done for music, but the voice is an unforgiving instrument because its your body. Even Dio was showing signs of weakness in his voice on Devil You Know; it happens.<br />Where Rick Rubin needs to be made to answer is to the charges that he is the foremost propagator of the \\"loudness war\\". The mixing/production of this CD is cluttered, much like his infamous work on Metallica's Death Magnetic. Depending on how you listen to this CD your mileage may very; it doesn't distort like Death Magnetic and at least the drums don't sound like they are right next to you head. To capture the classic essence of Black Sabbath I would have preferred an approach taken by bands like Witchcraft, Graveyard or The Sword where there is at least an attempt to give the instruments more space. There is little organic warmth in this CD, which 60% of people will never notice, but I find slightly grating.<br />Finally the songs themselves. Two are simply redone Ozzy era songs. I suppose there is some kind of irony in End of the Beginning sounding a lot like their self titled track Black Sabbath, which then bookends the fade out on Dear Father which is the same rain/bell track as Black Sabbath. Its cute, but a tad of a cop out. Then Zeitgeist is just Planet Caravan 2.0. The tempo change is nice, which shows us a little more of that experimental feel early Sabbath was known for, but they could have been a tab more original with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />This is real heavy metal the way it should be. Dark, pummeling, heretical and completely unrepentant. Everything a Black Sabbath CD should be.<br />Tony Iommi redeems himself and the Black Sabbath brand. If they hadn't done this they would have been a band that merely relived former glories and had to rely on Forbidden as their swan song.<br />Geezer Butler's playing is a master class in how metal bass is done. Forward in the mix, dirty, with attitude.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is a pretty safe release. They didn't tread a lot of unknown territory with 13 or embrace any new musical memes. It often seems like they are trying to be the slow sludgey band people think they are rather than the experimental, energetic band they actually were.<br />To make this work they needed Ozzy. His voice isn't what it once was, with him often sounding tired or uninspired. Was it him or the writing/production I don't know.<br />The mixing of 13 is a mess. The guitar and bass are fighting with each other for space, while the dynamic range of the instruments suffer from too much compression. A more organic, classic mix would have suited the release better.<br /><br />Bottom Line: 13 sits solidly in the upper middle of Black Sabbath's releases. They have some genre defining albums and some truly forgettable albums. 13 will not displace Paranoid as the most beloved Black Sabbath release, but I don't regret buying it or wish it was something else. I don't know what time has in store for the varied members of Black Sabbath, so this may be their worthy swan song or the beginning to a new chapter in this band's career. If you are fan of Sabbath's entire catalog you must buy this CD, if you are a fan of Ozzy era Sabbath this is still a very good CD, if you are fan of what passes for metal today you should get this CD and learn something from your elders.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Great story.  Great read!  David Baldacci has a way of getting my attention from page one and holding it until the exciting conclusion.  Sean and Michelle are my new favorite characters.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Best show on TV, great action, and love all episodes, I can't wait for season 2!!!!! Love it, Love it!!
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I'm not the target for The Host since a) I'm not a girl and b) I haven't been a young adult since Ronald Reagan was president c) I'm not a fan of the Twilight series and finally d) I've never liked any film made by writer director Andrew Niccol.  So I think it's understandable that I'm a little bit ashamed at how much I liked this movie.  What could elevate a movie with so much going against it?  Two words--Saoirse Ronan, who with this and Byzantium is quickly turning into one of my favorite actresses.  Ronan plays a girl whose body is taken over by a parasitic being as part of an alien invasion of the earth.  The alien and human end up liking each other and the alien (who physically controls the body) runs away to save the human girl and prevent her superiors from implanting her into a more compliant body.  Roman spends almost the entire movie arguing with herself in voice-over as the alien and human communicate constantly inside the girl's head.  It shouldn't work and with nearly anyone else in the lead it wouldn't but somehow Ronan manages to create two distinct, very likable characters.  The Host also has the distinction of featuring one of the strangest love triangles in YA lit history as the human girl and alien (who share the same body) fall in love with two different young men.  Beyond Saoirse Ronan The Host's chief pleasure are in the film's clean, shiny production design (always a strength in Andrew Niccol films--he's a consummate stylist, even if he usually gets very little else right) and effective performances from William Hurt as Ronan's kindly uncle and Diane Kruger as the villain, an alien intent on wiping out the remaining pockets of the human race.  Plotting wise this is about as corny as you would expect from a Stephanie Meyers adaptation but Saoirse Roman cuts through the general silliness and really makes you care about what happens to her human and alien characters.  If this had starred Kristen Stewart (Bella from Twilight) it would have been completely unwatchable--she can barely play one character, let alone two, but Saoirse Ronan, through sheer force of talent or will makes The Host worth seeing, if not quite a must see.  It's too bad The Host flopped in theaters but hopefully it will find an audience on video.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Another great read by Connelly featuring both Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller.  This follow up to The Brass Verdict brings the two even closer together.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|With all the rave reviews I expected something more in depth.  A lot of waiting as<br />Time ticks by.  Not worth even 99 cents.  Seems the only way to make progress is to pay for upgrades.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love PinInterest it is the coolest app ever, it works just as you were working on your computer, my favorite are photography and quotes, I use them for writers block, Amazon hit the nail on the head when making this for the Kindle HD love it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|With all due respect to Harris, she could have split the book. I realize that she wanted to end the series, but she managed to make the book both slow and to fast. Jamming as many characters in as possible, while Sookie takes her slow time to catch up.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I really wanted to play this game - really.  It took awhile to download and then when I started it it needed to download even more.  OK I thought here we go. Yay!  The intro movie played and then BAM it went back to my home screen.  Subsequent attempts to relaunch it resulted in an immediate return to my home screen.  So sad.  So I uninstalled it.  Baboy?  BABOY!! Ah, baboy. . .  :(
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was so intrigued by the story I could not put the book down.  I read it cover to cover in few days.  I think there is a little of Pat Peoples in all of us.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I luv it u can live in the ice age you make a town for the family's to live it is so awsome
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am a huge fan of this author. As a reader of thrillers and mysteries, it is such a pleasure to read a book that is so well written. I generally skim the books that I read but with Hosseini, every word is beautiful. Now having said that, I completely understand the bad reviews that are listed on Amazon. This is really not a novel. It is a book of short stories that have a connecting point, Abdullah and Pari, brother and sister. Sometimes this connection is very tenuous and remote but it is always there. So every few chapters, you have brand new characters you have to learn and this can be frustrating BUT each short story is beautiful and could be a novel if drawn out. Some of the short stories are far more interesting that the main story in the book and I wish that they had gone on and on.<br />This is a book of loss of yearning and of responsibility. Many of the short stories have another connecting theme, the obligation to take care of someone that you love. Do you do it out of obligation, out of responsibility, out of love...or not at all? What do you give up to take care of someone else? What do you have left of yourself when your entire existence is taking care of someone else? Very interesting question.<br />This is what I call a good book instead of the trash that I generally read and I feel better for having read it. I recommend it to everyone. How can you go wrong with a book this beautifully written?
0812982622|2.0|I finally cried \\"uncle\\" after 280 pages and stopped reading... This book is all about evocative descriptions, but we don't meet any characters with personality...the protagonist has the least personality of any of them, just stoically taking whatever misfortune or absurd twist of fortune, without really reacting...
B004WR125O|5.0|i recommend this product as it seem-lessly integrates with my Onkyo NetWork Receivers...if you have difficulty getting enough dignal strength, i recommend using a little USB rack for these...i cannabalized several from my Sony TVs since i did not need them for the TV...they will allow you to get a better signal in setups close to the floor or in a distant room...one other thing, i find that when i started to broadcast the SSID on my wireless router, that my wife devices maintained connection consistantly...this is not really a security risk, as SSID is embedded into signal and quite easily discernable anyway...good-luck!...jo'c
B003F3FJQO|5.0|If you are looking for an &#34;end of the world&#34; suspenseful thriller type book, this is a good book to read. You go through it like the characters, so you do not know what is going on or who to trust. It is good entertaining edge of your seat type book.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I like Michael Buble's voice.  I have appreciated the other albums and each seemed progressively better.  In this album his voice is still smooth and mellow, but I don't like the choice of music at all.  I am truly disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to play this game for me. The graphics are so good.<br />And it will make everything much better in your life
B009NQZVKG|2.0|I have read every James Rollins books and, with great anticipation, pre-ordered this one. It is a disappointment and I stopped reading about 1/4 through. It also has a plot with some similarities to a recent Clive Cussler novel published about 6 months earlier.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|If you are looking for an &#34;end of the world&#34; suspenseful thriller type book, this is a good book to read. You go through it like the characters, so you do not know what is going on or who to trust. It is good entertaining edge of your seat type book.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I am a big fan of The Piano Guys, and this is my favorite album so far. I am definitely enjoying this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is much fun!! I think it deserves five stars because minions rock, and it is so cool and really deserves the five stars.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It makes it easier to get on the Amazon site through my tablet. Seems to work OK, but haven't used it much as of yet.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Big fish made another amazing game with a great story line as well. Love playing their games in expert mode, much more difficult than other developers. Anxiously awaiting part 2.  Better than five-star rating.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|.. i was hooked... finished the game and hit 1000000 w/in 48 hours...oops!  wish there were more goals avail .. worth the price but if your someone that doesn't like to play things that don't have a goal don't bother
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|It was not as good as Star Trek: the Next Generation, but I'll be watching the next season as well.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on both my cell and my tablet. Keeps all my info on all my equipment at my finger tips especially when I have to go to the parts house for replacement parts. They always want to know the make, model, serial number etc. and I have them right with me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby is one of the best shows on right now. I was thrilled to find it available streaming on Amazon. Best of all, as a Prime member, I was able to watch for free.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Very historically interesting.  I just finished reading &#34;Lacuna&#34; by Barbara Kingsolver.  This movie was a perfect way to further explore the setting for the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game, wish there were more rooms,  hopefully soon.  I will be getting thd new one shen it is available.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I use this app everyday on both my Android phone and tablet to print e mail and other business correspondence to my home printer.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I love Nora Roberts, and this book is why I love her, it makes a great read. I am not particularly fond of love stories but hers always mixes in mystery.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Cute and very fun.  My granddaughters played it, and loved it,  ten minutes then it froze then it froze and we could not jump any more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good until level 10 when it requires you to rate the game to play more. but overall i liked playing it while it lasted.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|Works just fine with the exception that some UI elements of the app are off screen and only control method is trackpad.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Works great.  I can watch YouTube videos on my computer just like I can on my computer.  Very quick app.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I cannot see all my locations at a glance as I could before.  Getting to in-depth info is not intuitive at all. And the addition of ads makes it not worth even one star. Why not just drive people to your web site? I would be willing to pay for an app without ads.  The new look has ruined a very useful app.
0671004107|5.0|Contact is not only one of the most religious science fiction books I've ever read but also one of the most religious books I've ever read, period. In Carl Sagan's only work of fiction, the story is a mere backbone, a structure upon which Sagan can explore what he truly wants to explore, that is, the deepest questions of our existence.<br /><br />What is our purpose here?<br />Can humans live without institutionalized religion?<br />What are the dangers of extraterrestrial contact?<br />How did we come to exist?<br />Can science and religion be reconciled?<br /><br />Some questions remain unanswered, but Sagan provides fascinating solutions to some. He suggests that the Universe should be our religion. And even though I disagree with some of his conclusions, I appreciate such a philosophical investigation into these questions.<br /><br />Even better, the story and the characters behind these questions are fantastic. Sagan includes actual scientific explanations for the events, meaning you actually learn a bit about astronomy and physics while reading. His characters are among the most realistic I've ever seen. I have no doubt many of them were based on his own colleagues because only true people could inspire such realism. The protagonist, Ellie Arroway, is so impressive. She's a wonderfully feminist character written by a man in 1985. As she struggles in the aftermath of discovering extraterrestrial intelligence, my love for her grew denser than a black hole and more infinite than a transcendental number. The plot itself is captivating, because it's easily one of the best novel premises ever: what happens when humans realize they're not alone?<br /><br />\\"We all have a thirst for wonder. It's a deeply human quality. Science and religion are both bound up with it. What I'm saying is, you don't have to make stories up, you don't have to exaggerate. There's wonder and awe enough in the real world. Nature's a lot better at inventing wonders than we are.\\"<br /><br />Reading Contact I mostly felt joyous. Because I'm sitting here, right now. The most miraculous of miracles. I hear birds, I see the sun. Tonight I will see Venus, the Moon, and the stars. I don't know why I'm here. When we marvel at these things, when nature evokes the numinous, let's not fight about why or how or who. Because who cares? We exist.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this type of game and the developers deliver.  I bought the full version and it was worth it.  The only complaint I have is that it's a battery killer....but again with it.  Also, unfortunately the developers don't come through with their get free offers but I would have bought the game anyway I liked it so much! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining but not too difficult.  I loved it and I want more! I enjoyed every level. Sometimes it was challenging.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Takes a bit to learn the tricks but hard to put down.  Nice you keep points even after crashing.  Figure getting some of the upgrades will let you pull off some of the trips.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|So easy to use, and such a useful app. Use it to connect my kindle fire to my laptop and can access everything on my laptop. Read emails watch videos play apps would recommend to anyone :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy the game. There are a lot of challenges and get more difficult as you progress. Great game to unwind with.

B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Very nice graphics. Music and sfx good. Early  game play slow to get challenging.<br /><br />One annoyance is often having to scroll screen up so that I can pull back for long shot without moving finger off screen and shooting prematurely.<br /><br />Overall it's good but may not hold attention for long.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I much preferred the old look of TWC, because it was simple and easy to find stuff. Now this just looks like a cheap weather knockoff app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I just started playing and so far it's fun!  I remember when my mom's friends used to invite her to play Marjong and she never took them up on it, I think she may have missed out.
B00B5DNDR8|5.0|As usual, this new Gamma Ray alum is excellent, another great piece of this great German band and Kai Hansen!
B00003CXAE|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it.  It's one of my fall time favorites movies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes goosebumps or other scary novels. This book tells the damage and fights that involved zombies and the aftermath of the war.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|I've been reading a lot of the reviews and, sorry to say people, you have something wrong with your devices. I downloaded this app about 2months ago, and have received NO viruses or spyware any of the time, I am just freaked about that he can guess who you're thinking of.
B0086700CM|5.0|Who in the world doesn't love this game!? It's sooo addicting and fun! Who doesn't like this app!? Just asking!
B008J5G228|5.0|I have a few pair of Keen Newport's.  I like them because the toe box is wide (like MY feet), the toe bumper saves me from crushing my toes on furniture and corners (sometimes I'm clumsy), the materials are 1st rate and the last a long time.  Picked the color I did because I wanted the cheapest pair Amazon had (I wanted them to replace the pair I wear to the gym which finally fell apart after 10 years).  If you ARE a fashionista, Keen has a plethora of color combos.  Amazon got them to me quickly and I'm happy.  What more is there to say?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I liked this book and have already started on City of Ashes. I can't wait to see the movie next month.
B008PUF3VS|5.0|His was almost the best book in the forever world this was.sad yet amazing i ialmost have the erge to cry and this was the best history book ive ever read
B00594XOZU|3.0|Its a great overall messenger but I gave it 3 stars because you cant post and make memes and stuff like that and you cant look at them which is kinda stupid update it to where we can do that stuff and o would be 5 stars
B007FEFLTO|4.0|You can see my more comprehensive thoughts about Winter of the World at [...] or at goodreads.com. Although I have read many books about World War I and II, Fall of Giants and this book personalize the events of these war years by having the reader follow families in the key nations affected by these events. The books are long but I used my Kindle and I read the books while walking on the treadmill at the gym, thus feeding my body and my brain at the same time.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|confusing or am i just not mechanically inclined?!  ok ok  the latter...but i will keep trying to get those piggies to town
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this down. It was so interesting and sad all at. the same time. I love the relationship between Anastasia and Christian. I hate the ending I cried.
014312336X|4.0|As I have lived 40 years in Hong Kong, traveled in Mainland China, I really enjoyed the history..as well as the mystery!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This version of the movie has a smooth flow due to scenes be there that were left out of the theatrical version.  I believe this version is better
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran gives himself to his audience in HIS lyrics and is just an amazing person. This is a must for any music fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes me happy happy happy when I am on the toilet. I enjoy the minions the most in the movie. So it makes me happy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it was a great app until the latest update it just freezes when I try to download something then it reboots :/
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game makes me think. The whys and the wherefore...the level of difficulty isn't bad. A nice game to pass the time. You have to figure stuff out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the game is fantastic but it needs a new mode where you can make your own levels and share them online for your friends and the community to play
B0064X7FVE|2.0|They recently upgraded the Kindle app. They took out all of the information on the first page, including the humidity and the wind speed. They removed the ability to see a larger piece of the country on the map. If I could go back to the old version, I would.<br /><br />I hate the changes they made.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cool app really just download it its awesome so cool I so really like it go to the nether download pocketinveditor and edit inventory so fun
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Interesting, well written book, but I have to say, very depressing. I probably would not have read it if I had known more about it.
0440246318|5.0|(one of) my favorite authors.  Any Jack Reacher novel is most always excellent _ i have found.  Its a different kind of mystery novel.  Jack Reacher is not really a detective, just seems to hook up with people/ situations of many different types,  that need a special kind of help..
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great special effects, stunts, and twist in the storyline. Keeps you wanting more throughout the movie. Magnetic glove scene is classic.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|It's hard to say anything bad about this game, because the whole thing is amazing! The music, the gameplay, and especially the graphics!
B001FQFFMG|5.0|We loved this movie!  It is not difficult to see why Reese Witherspoon won the Acadrmy Award for Best Actress.  The only disappointment is that Joaquin Phoenix did not win Best Actor as well.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I just blew through both seasons and was awed by the wonderful talent including the work as a whole--getting to see what's involved backstage, the writing of the songs (which were wonderful), and fell in love with all the characters (except maybe Jimmy in season 2).<br />It's been over a week and I wish I could find something as good--find myself with snatches of the songs running through my head. I know I'll be watching the whole thing again!!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Classic Arnold movie that changed the way sci fi movies are made. Special effects are night and day compared to Terminator 1
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|Listen, I am just as surprised that I have only now learned about Ludovico Einaudi. Especially because he sounds like all of my favorite modern classical composers, the list of which includes Max Richter, &Oacute;lafur Arnalds, and J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson. I am just as intrigued about the fact that this artist has not popped up on my recommendation lists before (damn you clever algorithms!). And listen, if you knew about Ludovico Einaudi and didn't force me to immediately pick up all of his albums, than I wag my trembling finger right at you. But then, of course, I vaguely seem to remember his countryman, Fabrizio Paterlini, mentioning something about the musical beauty of this Italian contemporary classical and film score composer. The good news is that now I get to dig through his entire vast catalog dating back to 1996 and discover all that I have missed. And the best place to start is his very latest album on the Decca label, titled In A Time Lapse.<br /><br />From the very first track I am transported to that daydreaming place in which I first heard Richter's Memoryhouse. The gorgeous classical chords, the subtle bass to give the low frequencies that little oomph, the cinematic buildups that are so prevalent in my favorite soundtracks by Clint Mansell, the minimal electronic treatments and effects that pop along the way in the background of each piece, and most importantly, the melodies, the melodies, the melodies... Einaudi is credited with playing the piano, acoustic and electric guitars, celesta, Glockenspiel and even a Moog synth. Robert Lippok (who produced Redsuperstructure on Raster-Noton) appears in the credits for one of the track's live electronics treatment! Lippok previously worked with his brother Ronald and Ludovico on a project called Whitetree. A South-African violinist, Daniel Hope, who previously appeared on Warner Classics and Deutsche Grammophon releases [including Recomposed By Max Richter: Vivaldi - The Four Seasons] offers his skillful hand in four tracks as well...<br /><br />\\"The ambient and contemplative music [Einaudi] writes today is a fusion of eclectic styles, drawn from his studies in the minimalist avant-garde and collaborations with world musicians to rock groups such as Coldplay and Red Hot Chili peppers.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the fourteen pieces on In A Time Lapse, Einaudi explores themes of melancholy, contemplation and pure romanticism, through minimal solo piano, complimented by the mourning cellos, staccato harps, and occasional adagio rhythms. If one comes at this album from the direction of contemporary classical music, it would be too easy to align Einaudi's music with Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, Erik Satie, and Steve Reich. On the other hand, if you come from a modern classical world of the above mentioned artists, you can witness the maturity in the blending of the multiple styles influenced by today's electronica, ambient and film score scenes. The good news is that I can come at it from both, and as such, Einaudi is immediately placed upon a pedestal of my highly regarded modern classical composers.<br /><br />After studying at the Conservatory in Milan under the experimental and electronic music pioneer, Luciano Berio, Einaudi composed several chamber and orchestral works. In the mid-90s, Einaudi began composing film soundtracks. Since then he scored Doctor Zhivago (2002), This Is England (2006), I'm Still Here (2010) and Intouchables (2011). Meanwhile, his solo career boasts over twenty recordings, the highlights of which include I Giorni (BMG, 2001), Divenire ‎(Decca, 2006) and Nightbook (Decca, 2009). On January 19th, 2013, Einaudi hosted a live YouTube session during which he performed an entire album (this recording is still available online for your pleasure, and is embedded in this post above). I can not recommend this album enough! Fans of solo piano works by Nils Frahm, Dustin O'Halloran, Sylvain Chauveau, and Library Tapes will immensely enjoy as well!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update is crap. I used to use this daily and loved to zoom in on my house with the satellite map. Now that's been replaced with a genaric road map. No more hourly focasts either. You can keep the pop-up ads too. Time to delete this crap app. B-Bye!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great book for children around the age of 12 and something that an adult could read as well I really enjoyed and I think the majority of people would also enjoy it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I came late to Suits and, after reading some positive reviews, I decided to catch up.  What a fun and smart show this is.  I know people who have &#34;dropped in&#34; for a show here and there and they say it's average and usually a &#34;sob story of the week&#34;.  Oh what they are missing.  You really need to watch from the beginning to understand the premise and characters and watch regularly to see all the interesting plot developments.  Taken as a single episode, it won't be nearly as much fun.  The two leads are very good and Rick Hoffman chews his usual amount of scenery as the delicious Junior Partner Louis.  Speaking of chewing, I chewed through both Season 1 an 2 on Amazon in a couple of days and was sorry that it ended.  Happily, when I searched for Season 3, I found that it is starting next week (July 16, 2013)!  Can't wait to catch up with Harvey, Mike and the gang.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book! Really creative psychological thriller. Wanted to hurry and find out what would happen next and what the final outcome would be!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and creative concept for a game, it keeps you thinking. After the first level I was hooked and wanted to see what would come next.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I didn't think it was very believable that his lack of character changed very much, as it seemed to at the end.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|best superhero movie ever.  I do not see how they are going to out do this movie it the sequel.
B008I34YYY|4.0|This movie has a good blend of goofy and seriousness.  Honestly though its really quite campy, which is a good thing given the premise it was built on, it couldn't succeed any other way.  Overall it was more enjoyable than I had expected it to be.<br /><br />There is quite a few over exaggerated situations which criticize our (US) current political system and attitudes. I enjoyed it as I hadn't quite thought that it could be seen that way.  If you are sensitive to this type of criticism though, this isn't going to be a movie you're going to enjoy.  Save yourself some time and give this movie a skip.<br /><br />The special effects were good, though I felt some of the technology was a stretch (zeppelins is space...).
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Just the break from reality that we all need now and again. Takes you back to childhood dreams. Enjoy dreaming.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was great in IMAX and was as good on my 60 inch plasma with active shutter glasses. When guest visit I demo the 3D and they are mesmerized by the quality.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|great love the 80's tv.  my son loves this show he is 9 years old.  dum do de do dum dum
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The producer who put this together did a marvelous job.  The movie is full of great character actors who know their stuff.<br />An ensemble cast supporting each other.  Wonderful
B009VSW15Y|3.0|user friendly and nice to have. I still have yet to figure out how to take pictures with it and not have the camera looking at me!!!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Nice case, Enclosed was a standard disc, a 3D discs and access to ultra violet.<br />The quality of the 3D was exceptional.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|That's about it.<br /><br />Whoever said that this app has no permissions MAY be correct. However, whoever said you CAN'T play this in Airplane/offline mode is also correct.<br /><br />It's a fun game and very addicting. However, the lack of offline mode has me more than a little rattled.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I don't write too many reviews, but &#34;Goodfellas&#34; is one of the best movies ever made.  I don't buy very many movies, but Goodfellas is a must have for any collection. If you haven't seen, what planet are you living on?  The cast, director, soundtrack, and the story are top notch.  If you are a fan the mob genre you must see this movie.  The extra features on the Blu-ray are just an added bonus to the main feature.
B008J05EL8|3.0|doesn't add as much as I had hoped it would. Minimal fonts for what office suite is more than capable of using
B00006AG5N|5.0|I am a fan of Elvis since childhood when I had his music on tapes. This collection pretty much covers his hits. I'd say if you want to buy only one cd with his music, this is the one to purchase.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|I guess they stayed true to the heavily romanticized alternate Marveliscious universe version of WWII. I always find that kind of period romance a little hokey, as it seems people are defined by their &#34;role&#34; instead of who they are on the inside.  At least they stuck the not so happy ending, or was that heroic hokum as well... hmm. Dang, I kinda liked the girl ahead-of-her-time love interest. Anyway, the ending screamed &#34;Sequel...&#34; IF you like movies from the marvel universe this one is just OK.
1781162646|5.0|King is at his best here. I could not put this one down and can still hear the waves crashing against the beach, visualize the neon lights of Joyland, and hear the joyous screams and '70's era rock cranking as families come to Joyland for their summer vacations. The thing about this story is that the ghosts are not just limited to those that some people may or may not see. It's about the ghosts that reside within us all that we have to live with every day. King doesn't hammer you over the head with this point, but he sucks you in (more like invites you in) to the lives of his characters and within 20 pages I was hooked and could not stop reading. Very entertaining summer read, you will feel like you have been to Joyland and probably wish you could go back. I know I do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. It was a perfect summer romance. The characters were life-like and it was an easy book to read very quickly. Being a mom if two young and active boys, I appreciate a novel I can pick up and put down easily. Also, I need an escape without too much thought. The only problem was, I could not lay this book down, it was so good!
B0060CV7YK|5.0|I first watched this movie as a cold many years ago.  I watched it again just a couple of weeks ago.  It is still delightful!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|OK, we got a whole raft of characters, some of them brand new to film so the back stories are a little sketchy.  I think the movie would have benefited by focusing on the Loki's confederate and one new good guy, but you are hit with so many characters they can't even fit them on the cover art.  At least we know Thor & Loki from another movie, ditto Ironman, Captain America and the big green guy, but there are 3 apparently major new good guys thrown at us, as well as Loki's scary confederate.  What can I say, the plot and character development was very thin.  If you like stepping into the Marvel universe for some mental cotton candy, it was just... okay
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a fast paced novel. Keeps you glued to the book until the end. Anyone who likes surprises will like this book. Another Baldacci masterpiece.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is soo awesome. I recommend it to everyone. I really enjoy playing this game. ! Great job!!! c:
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a fun time killer that can suck you right in. It's a little weird that the brakes work while none of the tires are touching the ground but that does not detract from game play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Before you know it its been hours of fun. How can one little room be so hard to get out of. Oh ya IForgot to look in there.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Description did not indicate that it is NOT for a tablet.  Went to the computer  to find out that its not something that  I would,could play.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Can play as much as you want.  If your in a hurry is quick also.  It is very addicting. Love this game
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I found Mr. Duhigg “The Power of Habit” a thought provoking book. Over the years I have read many explanations of why we do what we do. Why we are making wrong decisions (and repeating them over again and again) and many factors which influence our behavior. We sometimes tend to look for the logical and simple explanation such as this guy smokes because nicotine is addictive, or we go to the nearest fast food chain because it is cheap and fast.<br /><br />In his book, Mr. Duhigg explains it in a different way. Many of our behaviors are not really based on a conscious and logical decision which we make, it is often based on our habits which as explained in the book many times are being triggered and performed without our “permission”<br /><br />I found the book fascinating, and easy to read. The book starts with the explanation of how habit emerge, provide many exaples (some very surprising) and go in-depth to discuss how companies can “create” habits and analyze our habits as part of their strategy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book not just to the business reader who wishes to learn how companies utilize our habits, but to anyone who would like to learn more why we do what we do. If I may, let me pose a challenge to you, once you finish the book and understand the habit loop, go ahead and find your top three “bad” habits and change them (the book will explain why you can’t erase them) to “good habits, you never know, it might change your life.<br /><br />Amir Avitzur<br />Author of &#34;Why do we sell low and buy high?

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|there's so much to this that make it worthwhile...imagination, putting family first, and my personal favorite great jolly science fiction, ha!
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Even the young children of today enjoy this musical and the songs. My granddaughter sings &#34;tomorrow&#34; everywhere including inside McDonalds and she is only 4 years old.
B00006AFF5|5.0|No one questions that Jim Carrey is an excellent actor and this is a great film! My family and I watch it year round and we all laugh every time!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is by far the best file manager I have ever used. No problems at all, and also have cloud syncronisation. Is the best
B005LAIII0|5.0|Watched it in the theater and it was amazing! Just watched it on DVD... it's still pretty good. But I must say only 3D on a big screen does it's justice!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|this game stinks! it has this the worst features! it is a complete waste of time! I personally think u shouldn't buy this app! its the worst game ever<br /><br />jkjk<br /> its awesome
B003UESJF6|5.0|I watch this all the time with my children. This movie never seems to get old! Definitely a family movie and will have everyone laughing
0062280228|4.0|This book has a great title, and having enjoyed a couple of Neil Gaiman's previous books, I was prepared to like this one.  It starts off with a realistic, present-day prologue,  told by an adult attending his sister's funeral, and almost immediately flashes back (and spends the rest of the story) to his 7 year old self, and his friendship with a neighbor girl (age 12) and her mother and grandmother.  This childhood story has a healthy dose of creepy characters and magic. It includes a wince-inducing description of an embedded worm creature, a couple of dislikable visitors and good-versus-evil showdowns.<br /><br />The \\"shortcoming\\" for me was that I had trouble \\"seeing\\" through the eyes of the man, when he switched to narrating as a young boy.  It seems like that whole part of of the story would have worked better as a ghost story for 6th graders (minus a couple of parts) rather than a story for adults.  It seems like with a little reworking it could would fit on the shelf next to his Newbery winner, THE GRAVEYARD BOOK.  On the other hand, the vocabulary and the imagery are both at a sophisticated level.  If you are a dedicated Gaiman reader, or a fan of magical realism, this might be for you.<br /><br />How I got this book: checked it out from the library
1781162646|4.0|He gives you a premise and then bends it into something entirely unexpected. As usual! Character explorations are crisp and precise. I only give it 4 stars because I love his big long books, but for a shortie, this is really good. Twists and turns and then a satisfactory--but not so much expected--ending. Classic King.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Not your typical zombie flick. Boy eats girls boyfriend, falls in love with girl. Not frightening or gruesome. More of a humor and adventure love story. Basically it's sort of a chick flick. So that said, get some good take out, flop on the couch with your main squeeze (guy or girl) and watch this movie.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I really enjoyed The Panther..You cant beat John Corey for great humor and excitement. It holds your interest to the last page.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome! but needs more guns hopefully the game was right after I rate I get more guns.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Since the update on current app, we need to know what % humidity as before the current hange please. Thank you!
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|This app continually hangs up.  I have had to start it over and over again.  I am going to try to return it. I bought it for the kids, but it has been more of a problem than a fun game.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game is a total ripoff and is a bad copycat of  Toca 2. It is  2 or 3 bucks, but it is totally worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been watching Downton Abbey since it came out. Excellent cast and world class direction. Truly a classic of epic proportion! Can't wait for Season 4!
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Avery Brooks is terrific in this role as the Commander of a space staion.  It was very smart to bring at least one character from Next Generation (Chief O'Brian) and to allow the Enterprise to be part of the first show so Captain Jean Luc Piccard could make a cameo appearance.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5 year old grandson really likes this game since he went and saw the movie.  A good visual and coordination game.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Still and always a great show. A great balance between morality and swag. Additionally, the narration throughout each show provides a better understanding of what he is trying to do and how.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a little hard but if you like subway surfers  you will love this game you can buy different minions with different powers
B005HE5J7I|4.0|I like Edward Rutherfurd's books very much. He gives you a couple of millinia of history within the covers of one book, pointed to the location with which he is dealing. Sometimes the family trees get a little tangled for me, and the necessary historical &#34;filler&#34; can be a bit dry, but, all in all, I really love reading this kind of book. I find it reminiscent of Leon Uris' &#34;Exodus.&#34;  I didn't like &#34;London&#34; as much as I liked his &#34;Sarum,&#34; but it gave me a perspective on the city, and on Great Britain as a whole, that I didn't have before.  If you like huge historical fiction, I would recommend this book.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I already watch it all and it is in perfect conditions, the blurays make the images look more cool !
0544002318|4.0|Inspirational.  Amazing what a human can do, how hard and far we can push ourselves when we work for it and believe in our selves.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is a classic.  And it was a replacement for my original that I guess I just lent out a few too many times as it became too scuffed to play without freezing.  But I love sharing great music, so I'm sure at some point I will lend this one, too.<br /><br />This arrived quickly and in condition as described.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A Great game!  My 10 year old and I fought over it!!  We really enjoyed playing it!  The puzzles are good but are not too difficult.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for the xbox and I think I will get for my kindle.<br />So that where I have my kindle I will be able to.play it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Reading Orphan Train books for book club.  Read one true story & then this novel.  It stayed pretty close to the actual details and I found the book very interesting and a good read.
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|These guys need to stop making products. There are far too many better choices out there.  I have yet to own an archos product that lasted more than a year
B003KIMOIK|5.0|i love these guys they are great they should have put out a secound one out if they do i would buy it
B000VR824S|5.0|I'm not one for sitting down in the Living Room and watching concerts.  I'd much rather be there in person to see one but this one is my all time favorite!  I highly recommend this Concert!!  Grab another piece of this concert:  Jeff Beck='Emotion & Commotion' and make sure you buy the version with the bonus DVD.  I think it may be an import, but it's only about 15 bucks and I'm sure Amazon has it. It has 5 other performances from the Crossroads 2007 Concert.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun. feels like your in the movie,if I could only make it off the first level, I don't play very much.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This DVD is a wonderful emample in demonstrating Kohlberg's Six Levels of Moral Development as one observes Shindler's ascent from materialist to Agapeist. This is why I purchased the DVD.
B001KT6JPA|2.0|Not so great. Ray Liotta eating his own brains was amusing, but overall, this was a pretty terrible movie. Goodness.
B00AOMSNUI|5.0|One awesome album, buy it and enjoy some of the best guitar riffs ever recorded. Anyone know what the cake on the album cover represents?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You've got to love them all!  Except for the ones you  love to hate!  Such an interesting comparison between &#34;The Family&#34; and those who serve them.  Each in his or her place and both with rigid rules for behavior.  The intrigue happens when the rules are broken!  Very engaging entertainment and quite a surprise ending to season 3.
0393089134|4.0|I enjoyed the text, the introduction , the notes, and the following:&#34; The Clockwork condition&#34; and &#34;Epilogue&#34;.<br />As I am French, I read the 1972 translation, published and republished by all editors...<br />It's a pleasure to read Burgess's text.<br />One thing I should have found, and that miss: precise indications between the 1962 text and that restored edition, in the text , such as footnotes: this to compare the two.
B001EYK54W|3.0|McQueen and Dunaway are great together in this film.  There is a lot of good chemistry between the two.  The pnly thing that drove me nuts was the soundtrack.  It just to offbeat for me.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|Awesome concert back in the day, own the album and needed the digital for my ride, Whats more to say. Buy it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for the next one to come out. The creators are brilliant!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally hooked on this show! So glad I could watch Season 3 via Amazon Prime! Highly recommend - it's so interesting to see how the other half lived back then. And, to see how similar their actions are to people today.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|At times I found myself thinking this cant be true but it is!  Great American, soldier, and life.  We all face trials in life.  The key is how we respond to those trials!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Will not download on original kindle fire, says that there is not enough space available, I removed everything else from my kindle and tried again for the same result. I really like mtg and hope that this is fixed so I can play it on the go. For now 1 star. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|Too naive. No sound control. The visual effect is horrible. could be much batter. I would not recommend to any one.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Tudors is an Interesting show that has good character development. Would recommend this though it is slow from time to time.
0486268659|3.0|I know it's such a classic, but, especially compared to other Dickens' works, it's a little bit boring and lacks rhythm.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|What a great start to a new series!  I enjoyed this series so much, this is the second time I am reading through it.<br /><br />Trust me when I say you cannot go wrong on selecting this series, although I would highly recommend starting from the first book in this series- which happens to be this one!<br /><br />On to the next!  Enjoy!  =)<br /><br />Shelbie Knight<br />[...]
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Please can  for<br />Gri the first time I like you are a meeting with the music of you are cute and think about it and think of you youtube video games and are you going through my house and think about the music stop at nothing to me down
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I love this series! And when I saw it available for such a great price, I just had to get it! DVD is good quality, I have yet to have any problems.
0451205766|5.0|A master piece. Beyond anything you can tell. The movies are in my top and still I find the book even better than the movies. Absolutely a must-read!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but thought that the city of bones was a great read and everyone should be told that. It have plenty of action and suspense.<br />I highly recommend it.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|The cast of actors are fantastic & the 2 main teen actors were fabulous in their first professional role.Any person from that era can relate to the &#34;Scouts&#34; & the all around innocence of life. I can rave about the movie enough.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Slow starter but subtly draws you in. Keeps you asking did Jacob do it or not? The father to me made me think he had something to do with it. Murder gene----always getting rid of evidence against his son. Then the utter detachment of Jacob to everything around him. His seeming lack of concern of his involvement.  a tragic and unforeseen end.
0385333846|5.0|being a Vonnegut addict I can't feel anything else than believing this to be one of the best books ever written about war, without praising war and in his usual satirical perfect humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8 year old was thrilled to have a Minion game on his Kindle fire! He is enjoying it. Has a similar feel to subway surfers.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Took a little while to get into this first of the series but the ending was fast paced and kept my interest.  Book 2 and 3 in the series were spell binding and I when book 2 was finished I went right to book 3 and couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend.  In places a bit too graphic for my taste.
B008I43DYU|5.0|It's a good way to carry a calculator to have when you need one.  It's one of the better apps.
0061729078|5.0|Open this book and try to be the same once again in your life! An absolute must! Huxley's prose and visual details are beyond awesome. The book is full of wonderful questions and you will think for hours about what you read.
1781162646|5.0|The best &#34;paperback&#34; I have read in many years.<br />I even talked my wife into reading it, as she is (typically) not a fan of King.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Season.  Faster paced. The bad guy situation in this one was a little overboard.  Hopefully, they get that over with quick.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Such a shame that HBO didn't have the money to keep this show going. Would have loved to see their dramatization of the fall of the Roman Empire. All in all a spectacularly done series!
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books in my life, maybe because I was blessed to read it while in the precise locale where the story develops. This a wonderful philosophy book disguised as a mixed fiction/non-fiction romance. An absolute must-read, you will not regret!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the fact I can use either soft music or my own playlist.  Its also a bonus that I can set multiple alarms.  This is a definite great buy for my samsung galaxy cell phone.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I want to start off by saying that I love the movie Pitch Perfect. However , the dialogue is hard to hear in one of the small scenes, it gets blurry during some parts of the movie. The last and most annoying is how the movie seems to just stop at or near the last scene every time I watch it on my Kindle fire.  I don't know if it's issue with that is, mine or Amazon's. Other than that I enjoy watching Pitch Perfect.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|this movie failed about 10 times during the first 8 minutes of watching it through our Wii.  very frustrating for 3 kids.
0374530718|5.0|A book every teenager should read. It's not easy to read about philosophy and Jostein Gaarder is a master of teaching philosophy while telling beautiful stories. This book is one of the most clear examples of that.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|An incredible account of how a man suffers and survives in a concentration camp when the chances of survival was less than 4 percent. Victor Frankyl goes on to analyse the behaviour and response of the prisoners who died and the ones who survived. Every man has a meaning  for his life and one who identifies the meaning can withstand  the pain and suffering
B0025KW29U|5.0|On the surface a musical staring three geek icons shouldn't work. However the excellent performances by the leads combined with perfect songs leaves you wanting more. People might be wondering why buy the dvd/blu-ray when you can watch this on netflix the simple answer is the commentary. Unlike most DVDs where the commentary is something that exists but you never really care; this DVD has several original songs that tell part of how this was made. The commentary songs although not as polished as those in the movie are still well performed and funny.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|Just excellent in every way!! Rented for my granddaughter to see but I now want to see others (as does she).
0061124265|1.0|I was a kid, read The Alchemist and really enjoyed it. Next step I open this thing and had to put it down after a few pages. Tried more than once but it's absolute rubbish. The prose, the plot, the characters, everything is painfully bad.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Very helpful local data and long-term forecasting we have come to know from AccuWeather.  Nice selection of weather news videos.  The interface could use some tweaking.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The show does well to keep you guessing about who or what will happen next.  You will also wonder who is the good guys .
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Absolutely love this show. Great story lines that will keep you hooked. I love law (I even have a paralegal degree) and every once in awhile they sneak in a legal maneuver even I don't see coming. Can't wait for season 3.
1416562605|4.0|Thrilling story, great insight of the Indian society, excellent pace and plot twists. Deserved acclamation to Aravind Adiga for such a fluid prose.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Reminds me very much of the old 8bit RPGs like Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star.  Very usable size for downloading without waiting forever.  The option to see enemies on the world map and choose not to engage them is very nice.
0385535147|5.0|The book was in excellentt condition. It exceeded my expectations.  I will be ordering again.  I ordered online so I did not have contact with anyone.  But the book arrived on time and I am enjoying reading it at this time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you have facebook and have friends on it you can vs your friends is in that cool .only on despicable me minion rush
0307474275|4.0|Dan Brown knows all the tricks. He is not a particularly good writer, he's just a very smart guy. This book is like a smoothie of some of the most misterious themes in our society, and as such it works. It really gets your attention, has rhythm and is intense, and for that I have to confess it deserves the hype. But don't try to go further in his \\"literature\\". And the movie sucks big time.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Gameplay on the Kindle Fire HD is very smooth and flawless, even with online opponents.  Well made app.  Great job!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I almost play it every day it is beast me and my friends love it but sometimes it won't let me move
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is coolest game ever an  you should think that too, every one can play and enjoy the game :D
0307887448|5.0|This was a GREAT book!  Ready Player One is the story of a loner high school student in the not too distant future trying to win one of the world's biggest ever video game contests. (Well, video game isn't really the best description - it's more like Sim City + Facebook + the Internet turned to life and then some.)  The book relies heavily on 80's references and pop culture, which turned what could have been a depressing dystopian fiction book into a colorful Rubik Cube of a story.  I have no clue why I waited so long to read this - I think something about the cover turned me off. Somehow my brain saw the cover and title and assumed this was about a piano player or something.  Nope.  Ready Player One is pure fun future fiction of be best quality.
B008LH4YYC|3.0|Makes it very easy to monitor memory and cache usage by apps on the system.  Nice interface that's simple to use.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|couldnt download a movie dwhich wasn't great but I'm sure it works w other videos it would be great if you could download a few movies , fix that and ill give it. 5stars
B00785P2QC|5.0|So far I've enjoyed playing this game on my Kindle Fire. Runs good no problems so far.  I recommend this game if u like city building games.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I enjoy that book, I saw it on Oprah show and decided to purchase it. I will recommend it to any one, specialy before going to a serious relationship.It will prevent you from making a lot of mistakes and know how to deal with your partner. Personally I wish I had known about it, my life would of been easier.<br /><br />thank  you
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Old guys never die easy. This is an okay movie. I will reocmmned the movie to anyone that like a lot of blow ups
0761169253|5.0|Steal Like An Artist is a book unlike any other I have ever read. Written by an artist/writer, it is designed to help the creative process in everyone, not just artists and writers. I would say that Steal Like An Artist is probably geared towards young adults, but I believe there is advice in this book that everyone can take.<br /><br />I found this book very helpful. It was filled with creative ideas that do not require a lot of effort to apply into your daily life. I also liked the layout. It was very easy to read and I ended up finishing it in about 2 hours!<br /><br />I really liked how at the end the author puts in a note saying that this is not a strict guide on how to be successful; some advice can be used, other information can be ignored. It's up to you what you take from this book.<br /><br />In general, I think this is a great book to read if you are in college. I believe it will help me make the most of the experience!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It's not that good because u barely get to do anything! But if you want a realistic hair game and if you have money then get toca Boca hair salon it costs money because it's good this one is free because it's not that good!!
B001QFZADA|4.0|I also enjoy this book,I will recommend  any one to read it, it really help you to know how to understand any one( friend, family etc.)and you can have a greast realitonship with any one.<br /><br />thank you
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game has many lay outs.From simple to challenging. It is a fun way to occupy your time. I really like this game.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Got this for my son. It is taking a while to put together but he loves it. Be patient, have a dedicated work space, and enjoy building.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I loved this app,it was free, fast, and it worked seamlessly with all of its features. I only wanted to use it for one thing but I think I'm keeping it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not a critical success, but I liked Jack Reacher a lot. It's a comfortable vehicle for Cruise to play and the audience to watch, with Reacher bringing a collection of experience-driven heroics to the table as he pushes his way through bullies and bad guys to uncover the truth, dispense justice, and save the girl. A nicely done script complements a cast of credible actors and some effective action sequences. Well worth the price of admission (well, particularly at $5 ;).
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I liked the general story line , characters and alternative world created by the author. After a good build up though the ending was flat and just sputtered....like the author was unsure of how to end this first book of the series.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Loved this movie! It reminded me of the old haunted house movies of the past. It showed that a scary movie can be scary without being 90% gory.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game would be in my top ten for all kindle games! I recommend this game for a lot of people so download and enjoy!! :)
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Mastermind Cartel Chief and his band of crack guerrilla warfare commandos/mercenaries slice through the DEA gauntlet like butter, but run afoul of tired small town sheriff and his clunky lackeys. Naturally! Good cast saves this derivative Arnold glamour piece, totally okay for a Sat afternoon with nothing else to do. Bring popcorn and candy; leave brain in jar.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This isn't your typical love story.  It combines elements of romance and the horror genre into a surprisingly funny and quirky movie. The main characters are memorable and before long you will be rooting for the zombies. The movie's length is just right and I recommend anyone who has some time to spare to check it out.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Ok so I read other reviews and all seemed good, I had developed much pain while reading the first chapter and almost shelved this book.  I am so happy that I pressed on, it is a fantastic book and everyone that suffers pain for what ever reason must read and re read this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Any one of any age can love this game. Me and my grandma compete to see who`s village is better.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is witty, educational, funny and new!<br />We love the legal situations and the funny banter between the two main guys.  Louis is so easy to hate and it's easy to get involved in the cases and the characters involved.<br />Great show!  We're racing through the season.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Some are way too easy requiring no thought at all but then I guess that is what makes it appropriate for all :)
B000ESST6U|5.0|This is one of the most incredible opera productions I've ever seen, the music is exquisite, the artist some of today's baroque interpreters
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman; I have read most of his adult novels and short stories for years. However, this book seemed a bit rushed and very short compared to his other works. Additionally, it still felt more like a child's book, except for a couple of scenes that could have been changed; following a seven year old just wasn't particularly interesting for me. It's a good story, but it's short and Gaiman has had better.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Great cd  Black Sabbath at there best .Welcopme back the boys are back in town  and tinn lizzy move over
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Interesting premise with good interlaced and arching story lines. It keeps you hooked. I enjoy marathoning episodes so all the characters stay fresh.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Was LOVING this game and got to a stage where it won't let me continure, no matter how many days I wait, becuase it wants me to ask my friends for lives.  If I wanted a game I had to play with my friends I would have stuck to Facebook!
B0081BU42O|5.0|What is the use of political power when rapture is Real Soon Now? Would you kill to go to &#34;heaven&#34;? If so, how many? Not only does Banks flesh out his ideas about how a &#34;heaven&#34; might work in a Hard SF world, but he explores the moral questions that follows. A great read, and the afterglow of questions and dilemmas his stories leaves behind makes your brain buzz.
B001AQT11M|5.0|THIS WAS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER BE CAUSE HER COPY WORE OUT.  SHE'S HAPPY  IM HAPPY  END OF STORY<br /><br />  &#34;THE END&#34;
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Only stopped and started a few times during the showing. Otherwise an okay predicable movie. Liked the part where Streisand ate the steak...as like Adam on the Man vs Food program.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Once you get by the total unbelievability of the story line, this is fun to watch.  Nice effects.  Giants in the clouds??  Really??
B007V65R54|5.0|It the Republicans had been paying attention they might not have bee surprised on election night.  They would have still lost but they would have known why.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it is a fun game I have the other cut the rope games and this one is just as fun.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|Nice movie for a long plane ride!<br />It is one of his favorite movies and he likes to watch it over and over.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Pretty good story line .  Wahlbergs character, however is not the brightest bulb in the box and some of his judgements were pretty far fetched.  Keeps you thinking.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I liked the later seasons even better.  But this is a good first season that led to a great show.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Love this app! Easy to check in on all that blog activity. Easy to group blogs of a kind together, flag entries you want to save, add more blogs. Does everything I need it to do :)
B003NRYMZQ|1.0|The show started out interesting: like Warehouse 13 with alien paraphernalia.  But they added an extra dose of sexuality each episode culminating in the show that clinched my decision to turn it off.  Our hero, sent back to 1943 ends the episode passionately kissing his namesake and slow dancing with him.  Right...in 1943.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Lots of action and tongue in cheek banter.  If not taken very seriously, it is fun to watch.  Does make you wonder where they got there witch weapons however.
B00C0W08XK|4.0|I am new at Sudoku, but I like using the on-line version better than the books.  Since I am a new to Sudoku, I have too many erasures and at least on the easy version it shows a wrong answer in red!  Like that!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it.. Watched season 1 and 2 in one week. Can't wait until season 3 starts. You won't be disappointed.
B000000WA4|5.0|For the first time since a very long time, my heart is leaping up listening to a record and reading the lyrics.<br />...Doing my best to keep from playing it AT FULL BLAST!!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Total crap.  Just a trip to the bank for the actors.  Lots of work for the boys who blow things up.  Acting non existant and not even a fun movie to watch.  Glad it was free
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done, great acting an costumes, super storries & character development, historic, Excellent Ooutstanding now waiting for next season  thanks
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book, but I much prefered book # 1 and  book #3...<br />Still a good read... I'm sure you'll enjoy!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was absorbed by this very clever story. Also appalled at how I kept changing sides. I wanted the book to end differently but was amazed at how it did end. What a great read. Wasn't so keen on the bad language though.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|as many times as this movie has been retold and made over, i think this version of the &#34;Planet of the Apes is brilliantly done. I wouldn't change anything about it. the action was well done and not too over the top. the story line is actually believable
B001HMSFFC|4.0|The Sex in the City ladies are always a hit, wish there was a 3rd and 4th movie in the future !
B003O86FMW|5.0|For me, CATCHING FIRE is the best of the trilogy.  I was sad when I finished it.<br />I didn't sleep for days, because I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to see the movie!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I got it for my daughter's and I ended up playing it more than them.  I check on the horses on time and do my best to keep them at 100% all them time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun little puzzle game with enough challenge to keep you interested, but not so difficult that you get frustrated. If you enjoy problem solving games, you will probably enjoy this.  Needs more levels.  :)
B001NLKT60|1.0|I'm sorry, call me a prude, but all that sex with this one and that is not for me. Give me a woman man love story with sex in it, Sundays. The book category was misleading. Need to change that. ADULTS ONLY BOOK.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Although I read it cover to cover, it took me everything to finish it.  I didn't like it at all, to me, it undone the great story that was developped in Catching Fire...
B00992CF6W|4.0|This a fun game, but I wish that the realms were something you didn't have to wait for. But it is a great game on creative.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is hardcore! This is more manly than chest hair! The only problem I have with this game is that my friends tend to laugh whenever I mention how calm grooming ponies makes me feel.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|i was looking for a good creepy horror flick. while this does have a few good creepy parts, i was rolling my eyes at most of it. very predictable to me..except for the end. i didn't see that coming but thought it was really dumb. maybe if your in the 12-16 age range..i don't know.  i wouldn't recommend this nor would i watch it again.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|This movie was very well made and well acted.  While the storyline differed from the book, these changes were necessary to tell the story in two hours.  I hope Stephanie Meyer decides to complete some follow up novels so that this story may continue.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is great for kids, and an adults inner child! I love how it is awesome, but it can even teach you how to care for a horse
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love the comic book themed movies! Will watch it again and add the movie to my wish list to own personally
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works well.  Some posts warned against the magnets falling off, so I am still waiting for it to fall apart.  I'm hoping that so long as I don't mistreat it, this dongle will last a while.  I can't say whether the charging is faster, but I'd like to think it is!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm a fan. Through the good and the bad. Through the hilarious and the gut wrenching horrible. This show and season has it all.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|Love it!!!!<br />Love it!!!!<br />Love it!!!!<br />Play everyday, can be a challenage. well worth trying this game on all levels.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|A must read for Blade Runner fans. It is very interesting to see the original book vs how the movie was created. Wish there were more of the series made into movies.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Of course, you must be an aficionado of &#34;B&#34; and/or Grindhouse and/or off-the-wall movies to appreciate this gem. But if you are, you will love this spoof. Extremely well made, great cinematography, the fight scenes are choreographed superbly (think Matrix crossed with Kill Bill). The humor is to die for. We *had* to own a copy.
B00CSJYYO4|5.0|I read it 16 years ago... And just read it again: and like the first time: love it!!! Excelent book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Works great on my kindle! No pausing or mess ups like with others apps. Connects with my friends no problem. Love it!!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|May be I expected more from this book.  It was one of the first books that I read on Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great memory game.  It keeps you thinking!  Paper and pen needed to assist in solving the puzzle.  Can't wait for more!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought it read like a real account of the things people would actually experience under such conditions.  It's only a matter of when, not if, a global pandemic threatens the continued existence of mankind.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I found this book quite difficult to read, but in part it was quite interesting.  'Can only give it two stars.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It's amazing how lives can intersect over decades.  Hosseini has woven a truly believable and touching tale of this phenomena.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this app. It reminds me of Temple Run a bit, only I say its better. I say get this game especially if you like Temple Run.
B004JHY80I|5.0|This is an excellent book.  One of the very best that I have read for a long time.  Couldn't put it down
0316017930|5.0|This work was very insightful and I would recommend to anyone who likes to think critically about society. Gladwell tackles some of the most thought provoking nuances of our time.
B00821OX98|4.0|Started watching this with mixed expectations, but was pleasantly surprised.  Great acting and the special effects were very well done.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|Great book written by Milton Friedman. He is by far the best and most knowledgeable capitalist that I have ever read.<br /><br />P.S. I have not read any F.A. Hayek
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I watched the first episode and was hooked. It is a well done series with good story lines and interaction between characters. This is part of Amazon Prime Instant Video and is a real treat as I stream.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this app.... it makes me think and my matching skills are getting  much better.  I enjoy this app, I played on my computer when I  was  bored, even then I loved it. I really recommend this app. You'll enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you love puzzles thanks is the game for you.  Love this game! Makes you use your brain lol.  Highly recommended
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The female lead is an awful actress.  Her facial expressions are somewhere between constantly surprised and constipated.  Actually found her to be significantly distracting from the film.  Tom's lines are at times quite contrived. Some good action sequences make a 3-star.<br /><br />I apologize, this is now a 2-star movie.  I just finished watching it (the first review was about 3/4 the way through when I had to do some work and take a break).  The lead actress continued to bring down the film with her poor acting and ridiculously poorly written lines. Cruise's dialog continued downhill and the plot became really dull...as dull as you can get and still have decent action scenes.<br /><br />A 2 at best.  Makes me wonder if this was just a scientology run picture rather than one that had good writers, directors, etc.  I know Cruise was the exec. producer, so ?.....<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Okay, so this movie is now available for free through Amazon Prime so I decided to give it another chance.<br />I stand by my evaluation of the female lead.  I honestly cannot stand the vapid, constantly surprised look she has during the whole movie.  I mean, eyebrows raised high, always talking in forced whispers, and that's literally ALL her character does. Irritating, annoying, just plain weird. Its like they tried to add drama to a scene by asking her to \\"be really dramatic\\". And the fact that they made her have this weird \\"attraction\\" to Tom from the get-go...also a very awkward somewhat non sequitur aspect to the script. Felt like it was put it in just for Cruise's ego.  I would be quite happy to not see a movie with her in it again.<br /><br />Again, I will say there are some pretty good action sequences, with the bar fight being one of the better ones.  Except one that sticks in my mind: the finale (slight spoiler alert) where Robert Duvall is sniping from 300+ yards away...in the dark... and during the sequence, somehow the bad guys who are standing in the bright lights areshooting right at him with their machine guns while alternating to Tom behind a rock 50 feet away. All you could see of Duvall was a tiny muzzle flash when he shot (seemingly 500+ yards away at that time), but the bad guys were popping 3 or 4 shots in a row right at him and hitting within inches every shot...with machine guns.<br /><br />Still a 2 star because of decent action.  The dialog and inter-character relationships are really subpar.
0756405890|5.0|This is unlike any other fantasy novel I've read. There isn't terribly much fantasy to not, not in terms of lots o' magic and magical beasts. It's there, but it's more like flavoring to the tale, a vehicle for the story. This book is intelligent, mature, and masterfully written. It's moving, exciting, and a page turner, which I wouldn't expect out of something so epic in scope. I can happily recommend it to all fans of fantasy, from my dad to my young nephews (minimal parental guidance needed). I'd even recommend it to those who aren't fans of traditional fantasy. This could break them into the genre.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is a don't put down until your done with it book! It's an amazing book with so much detail of the undead! If you saw the movie and think the book is the same let me tell you it is not the same!! The book is alot better!:)
B004EPYZQC|5.0|No, this movie does not make any sentimental or meaningful statements about life. However, this movie is full of over the top action and fun car scenes that are ridiculous. There are two types of people in the world: Those who take movies so seriously that they do not enjoy Fast and Furious movies, and those who think that The Rock fighting Vin Diesel is the greatest combo ever. The special effects and stunts alone are enough to make this movie five star.<br /><br />It is amazing to me why the Rock is always sweaty, and why he always is wearing an Under Armor shirt that is three sizes too small?
B003DES8I6|4.0|This movie has a very similar story line as the original \\"Boondock Saints\\". The two brothers have to come back to America on a ship from Ireland to hand some business that revolves around an imposter saint. Along for the ride is a detective who has similar \\"artistic\\" attributes as the original detective in the Boondock Saints original. For me this movie was slow paced and a challenge to keep up to because you didn't know what was different. On the plus side it had a few of the same actors as the ones that were in the original. So, that was nice. The fact that there was a lot of action in it too was nice.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book! Keeps you interested from start to finish. Grisham is great with details and the names of his characters.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Go to your web browser and type in how to down load candy crush saga on your kindle fire hd  and they will show you step by step how to down load the real game from Facebook it is very easy and they show you a video how to down load candy crush now I have it on my kindle fire hd  and love it.

B002ZAVNJ0|5.0|I listen to this album at least once a day. While I'm driving I'll have no problem getting into the songs on it. However a lot of the songs on this album are mixes of the same one. So, it gets boring after the first two or three. As far as the digital download goes, it was short and simple. There were a good amount of songs that downloaded quickly and the quality was crisp. I was able to transfer all of my music to the ipod using the amazon music tool and itunes. So, all in all, great purchase.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really enjoying this...Pretty interactive and entertaining....  defiantly educational if you don't  knohorsehorsesknow horses. Keep children and adults entertained for hours
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totly awasome I play it every day.if you haven't played this game you have to get it.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|I think I watched this movie 3 times within the first two days of buying it. The fact that the director was able to pick three leads who were able to play off each other so well that you almost believed they were actually brothers was awesome. During the time frame that it's set people aren't allowed to buy alcohol so the brothers create a moonshine distillery and package and ship the bottles of the stuff they create. However a new police officer in town isn't too fond of their business and does whatever he can to stop it however he can. Their is a lot of violence and a lot of action. However, its something you would expect to see if you were alive during this time frame and nothing too over the top like explosions or electronics (maybe one or two explosions). Anyways, I would definitely suggest it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is definetly a book worth giving a try if you are a fan of fantasy. My favorite thing about the book is that there is never a dull moment. I also really enjoyed the humor that was added into the dialogue. It was refreshing because the story could get a little intense at times- well, more like all the time haha. Clare is excellent at keeping her readers hooked with her twists. Long story short read this book. I doubt you will regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a good game for kids . I'm nine my nefues 5 we  absolutely  lovelove it and we think you would to.  Buy it it is so awesome.:) :) :)
B002UEW31I|5.0|If you are into Quinton Tarantino movies this is the one for you. It starts out in a dramatic fashion with a German detective who visits a small town where a few Jews are being held captive underground. However, the owner of the house that they are in is resistant to admit that they are there because of fear of captivity. Finally he gives in and the German soldiers practically destroy the house and everyone in it except for one who gets away. You find out later on that she is handed down a theater from her aunt and that's really where the plot starts going. Brad Pitt and a few other lead actors are part of a rebellious military group that finds Nazis and decimates them. You're going to see a lot of gory stuff in this movie. It's a Quinton Tarantino flick. However, most of it is not fact based and has very little to do with the stuff that was going on during that time frame. It has great acting and that's really all you can say for it.
1451648537|5.0|Exceptionally well written.  Could not put it down.  Seems very objective, warts and all.  Steve Jobs' visionary powers were unbelievable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is very useful.  I find that it there when I need and it is hard to find a simplified one on the internet.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Didn't know what to expect.  This was a good book with an interesting plot twist.  I had to get used to the dialect, but it was not a barrier.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I saw it in the theaters, it was awesome. tons of in-jokes and also ones that anyone would find funny.<br />I wonder why the people that post these here dont give a better description. For instance does  the dvd come with any extras? I don't know because it does  not say.
B00DW2PDH8|4.0|It was as Simon said it would be. The reader would be as lost as Eternal is. This story takes the reader on a journey with the characters as their thoughts, memories and dreams flitter you from one reality, timeframe and era to the next. It may seem disorientating, confusing and complex, but it is what lends the book the unique and terrifying experience you share with the characters.<br />Eternal, known to her demonic Vampire Suckling as Delicate Rose, suffers from amnesia after a traumatic experience. She is fleeing for her life and then finds herself rescued from the danger but placed in the Douvrey Institute for the insane. She is lost, frightened and yearning for her true love. Her inner Vampire though is silently trying to break free and relish in it's natural food source, blood.<br />Lucien is a likeable Count with a cruel disposition, obsessed with Delicate Rose and Vampires. He becomes a hybrid Vampire but wants to be released from the curse of being dependant on Eternal for her blood as a Suckling. Right before the final moment when she could finally transform him into a true Vampire and give him eternal life, she escapes and his inner demon forces him to hunt her down and kill everyone that stands in his way in order for her to release him from his torment.<br />The ending is shocking, the reading is difficult and the writing is intelligent. At times almost nothing makes sense. This book is not for the stupid, tired or faint hearted. Simon Okill messes with your mind and challenges you as a reader with this book. Keep reading no matter what. For this reason I rate this disturbing, difficult, complicated but brilliantly crafted book 4 stars.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I didn't enjoy the movie because of this book! It is am amazing read, so well written. I wish the movie script was the same as the book because &#34;the book IS so much better!!&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the greatest shows created. Its amazing to see how others live. Great actors and story line. The story line constantly moves and there is never a dull moment.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is very good. The HOS are challenging but not over difficult. There are also a good number of other puzzles to work to keep things interesting. There are lots of hints and a guide if needed. As the other reviews indicate you will have to pay $4.99 to play the game all the way through.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is something I like because I can txt my friends and well if I don't have my phone I can txt with my kindle and stop txt them is I say get it :-)
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is great because it has different levels and routines so you don't get bored.  Very easy to follow.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think it is a very good game I should say something bad about but it's to good of a game to
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a great set.  DVDs were excellent and I received them quicker than I anticipated.  I only wish I would have ordered all three seasons as opposed to only seasons 1 and 2.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The same well known songs but without the orchestra and choir overdubs in some tracks. A must for all Beatles fans.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Too much graphic language. I couldn't even get past the first few pages. All I wanted was a good suspense story. Senseless, gratuitious nonsense. Hated it. Not worth the time.
B001CVMD4M|4.0|Songs and singing are great.  The concert itself was kinda silly, with the way they were dancing and dressing.  Not sure the male dancers added any benefit.  They could have use a better dance instructor.  I'm still a Spice Girls fan though!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool works beautifully for our small back yard. My little 2 yr old loves it! The spraying water is just enough to make the pool time fun and the slide is not too tall. The colors are bright and fun and the extra toys are fun too. Would definitely recommend!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Loved the books after watching the series. Great for filling in the blanks. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim one day and wish I never had. My battery also wishes I never had. This game will take over your free time
B005DD7H50|5.0|This is the third time I've seen this movie.  The acting is extremely entertaining as is the storyline.  I had forgotten what a clever ending it had so decided to watch again.  Definitely worth it!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game is aggravating. You play to unlock potions &amp; spells, but then you have to pay to use them, which doesn't seem right.
0393338827|4.0|It is an easy reading account of those who had figured out how and when the impending financial storm would hit and found ways to profit from the the maelstrom.<br />As their motivations were, to a man, how to make money from the affair; once they had placed their bets, their efforts to yell fire in a burning theater were relentless, if ultimately unheeded until it was too late.<br />I can remember the turn of the century when investment banks were all demanding their rights to experiment with &#34;financial innovation&#34;.  I have since learned the composition and nature of the Federal Reserve in backstopping those innovations no matter how ill conceived they may have been or will be in the future.  If you ever see someone walking around wearing a tee shirt with the proclamation that &#34;The Game is Rigged and the System is Rigged&#34;. . .  That will be me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a book like no other<br />Other books express the perfect side of human nature, where  every one lives happily ever after<br />The thing is, there is no perfect side<br />Everyone has to cope with flaws and illnesses<br />The Fault in Our Stars really expressed that<br />It gave a story of a young teenager, with cancer, living through through the difficulties of her body. It explains that everyone passes away but some leave a bigger impact or \\"scar\\" on th  people they leave  behind than others.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Can't wait for the next season.  As the two prior seasons, I was pleasantly surprised and left me wanting more.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|This has to be the most intriguing and addicting serial killer case in all of history.  So many questions within his letters and ciphers that he makes you feel as if the case could someday whether it be a month from now or 500 years from now be solved. Robert Graysmith played by Gyllenhaal seemed to have his life entirely consumed by this case and I can see why.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it so fun never gets old always keeps u busy keep up the good work on these good games
B00821OX98|5.0|Solid acting. Above average character progression, and action. Special effects are as expected with such a low budget and don't really ruin the show by any means.  The Skitters actually look pretty decent, but the mechs are meh. If you watch this show and take into consideration the low budget, then watch a show like the Under the Dome you will be embarrassed. This show blows it away with 1/10th the payroll. Acting, characters,  plot etc. Good job TNT.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It was very predictable but did make me laugh. It's one of the Bette movies you can get for free on Prime streaming.
B002NNA9N0|2.0|sad adult loser salesmen not able to sell their product and using stupid measures to try to get a sale...so depressing and dark.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I only read about the first 10%.  It seemed like too much work to get into the novel.  Maybe I will go back to it, but I was just not interested in it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I am a Grandmother of 3 and I LOVE this movie...I enjoy watching it alone AND with the Grandchildren....Very entertaining...recommend for all ages...
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Bought it for Home, listened to it non-stop for the last week. Reminiscent of DMB, great stuff.<br /><br />I Highly recommend.
B001IWV030|4.0|All these great &#34;detectives&#34; brought together for a relaxing hour or so of reminiscing while chomping popcorn.<br /><br />Get friends together and challenge the background.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love the series, great character development.  Couldn't stop watching until I finished the entire season.  must watch must watch this
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far this app is a lot of fun and a good boredom killer! Cant stop playing. I would definately recommend this game to anyone!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|item was purchased as a gift for a dear friend; arrived faster than expected and in perfect condition. Very reasonably priced
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Gave this as a gift to my daughter, who has played it so much she has &#34;worn grooves&#34; in it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|GREAT QUALITY , GREAT PRICE, AND GREAT MOVIE...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND..YOU WONT BE SORRY, IT;S WORTH EVERY PENNY, GO GET IT
B0094BB4TW|5.0|As stated in the title very easy to use on your kindle fire.  Easier then on my phone because the kindle has a bigger screen.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This, in my humble opinion, is the best app available and believe me I have tried I think all of them. Their reports are timely and usually have more accurate readings then the major networks.  Everyone in this family use this app.  Keep up the good work.
B00454U1NS|5.0|The compilation of songs on this CD is fantastic!  Pink is, by far, one of the most talented singers/performers -- incredible voice and fantastic entertainer!  This CD has some of her best work to date (they can't put them all on one disk!).  I am forever a fan and love this collection... I have Pink's Greatest Hits.... So far!!!  in my car's CD changer (along with The Truth About Love) and find myself singing to the songs as I am driving down the road. :)
B008G12ERC|5.0|How to describe their music...<br /><br />Mozart and Bethoven got together and gave birth to Pink Floyd and Led Zeplin.  They then had Evenescence and Skrillex.  That's just one song...<br /><br />Complex rock, but it certainly rocks
B008J34466|5.0|I recently purchased this CD along with Pink's Greatest Hits... So Far!!! and I couldn't be happier!  Pink's voice is so powerful you can't help but sing along, and feel her passion in the songs come out through your speakers; an intoxicating voice that truly entertains!<br /><br />This CD showcases Pink's music along with the collaboration of several other extremely gifted artists; a great CD to have in your collection!<br /><br />NOTE:  I would suggest, if giving as a gift, to please remember this CD is not suitable for everyone and should be listened to by age appropriate individuals.  Some parents might not be happy with your gift selection :)
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Does what i need it to do, but i have only had it a week or so. I will probably have a more thorough look at it this week. Like the &quot;wordy&quot; option. Nifty neato!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|New to the game, very challenging, so much fun. Really like the Sealed Deck play, like the ability to make my own deck. Loads of fun!!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Since I am a supporter and a fan of J.Cole's from his early beginnings, this album, proclaimed &#34;sophmore album&#34;, was everything I ever expected from Jermaine and his art. It's lyrically complex with witty wordplay and great music production. Really a genuine hip hop album, worthy 1st place on any list.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Love comes into play in almost every feature film you will ever see. It comes in many forms and often times, entire movies are centered on it. Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff. To be honest, I thought it might be good for a few laughs, but I never thought this film would be as good as it was. It has a message and makes an impact, while being a funny, edge of your seat thriller. This was really not something I would usually go for, but my recent Walking Dead inspired zombie craze put it on my radar and it was an amazing ride.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Sometimes I play with this app while i am bored. It basically gets rid of the boredom while on trips to the coast. i find it useful for drawing pictures. Definitely recommend for kids with creative minds.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not what I wanted. Please remove from menu and refund money. I was trying to get the actually game for my reader.
B00594XOZU|5.0|With kik, I don't have to pay for additional texting through my cellular provider. Photos downloaded automatically are saved and its on kik folder.Great app
B00C2VIA52|5.0|surprisingly great game. extremely well thought out, and imaginative. it's simply the best game of its kind out there. highly reccomend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a very fun game! I can sit and play it for hours at a time. My mom and brother got me addicted
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I would recommend watching this. It was very entertaining. If you've seen the first two seasons you'll want to see this season.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I hate social media but love pinterest. One can learn so much from seeing other people's interests. I have become an addict pinning everyday. It works flawlessly and is well designed. Great for recipes. Great for.researching topics you are interested in. A life changer.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The graphics are sweet and the game itself is great for any age.<br />You can't go wrong in getting this game.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Many open ends are closed but very well IMHO.  Seems Rollins struggled to choose an ending as there is an alternate.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|No matter what I do this app does not work. It picks up my Wi-Fi printer but I can not get it to print.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Younger women, in particular, should read this book.  She gives a lot of great advice on how to manage your career early on and encourages you to look at all of your options before making decisions.<br />I think it continues to be difficult for women to be leaders in this day and age because of stereotypes and sexism - I see this all the time.  Ms. Sandberg does recognize this and gives advice on how to try and make it work.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun. It is just like a lot of other games you can play on the internet but this one you don't have to play online
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Maybe it was the place but this did not seem to match other novel's levels of what was going on or what was happening.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book beautifully encapsulates what a startup is and what it should do. This is a must read for any entrepreneur - beginner or expert.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Star Trek TNG is the best! All of the seasons are great, and you can't go wrong with any of them. The metaphors and theories that are toyed with are amazing!
B0090EJ99A|3.0|I would not recommend it to everybody<br />otherwise it's OK<br /><br />ok not soooo good<br />need 5 more words<br />it is not worth the effort
1781162646|5.0|A little off the typical Stephen King path but still retains enough Kingesque traits. Not as macabre as most of his other books but entertaining. I found it a pleasant detour from his \\"usual\\". I liked it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very good acting; Very good casting; Very good plot.<br />I watch several episodes in a row and the storyline flows very well.<br />Some of the aliens appearance are a little weak.<br />I would make the story similar to the TV series “V”, except with a better cast and better acting.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Full of imagination a great female lead character and an appropriate amount of magic and adventure.<br />I find that I read this book once every year.
B0039N74CW|5.0|IT IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. I IS AN AWESOME MOVIE, I LOVE WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I'm relatively new to Kamelot having discovered them via internet radio and their similarity to other bands... namely the Tommy Karevik connection to Seventh Wonder. Comparing Silverthorn to other Kamelot albums such as Ghost Opera is interesting... it isn't just the vocals that have been improved with Tommy's incredible talent... it seems that the writing and production are better as well. I don't know if that is due to Karevik or just the development of the &#34;sound&#34; of the band. Regardless, Silverthorn is tight, engaging. Tommy's vocals are soaring and very listenable over some good, crunchy power metal. If you are a fan of either Kamelot or Seventh Wonder, this would be a good addition.
B00AVFO41K|3.0|First of all, I'll start off by saying this isn't a &#34;clear the board&#34; game in the sense that some people seem to be expecting. It's more in the style of Tetris, where you'll eventually get overwhelmed with pieces and the point is how many you can clear beforehand. The lack of a timer makes this more of a strategy than a quickness function, and I think that's what some of the other reviewers have been missing. It's also one of the things that I like about the game, I don't have to worry that a timer is running out while I'm trying to figure out patterns. That being said, the lack of instructions really hampers you from being able to figure out exactly how everything works. There's no way to determine how to move the pieces, and there's no way to tell in what way they're able to move. Also, there's nothing to tell you how many extra pieces will appear on the board for each move you make. There also seem to be a few bugs (unless these are intentional, and again, the lack of instructions doesn't make this clear), such as pieces not moving when they have a clear path or a row not clearing when a piece of the same color appears (rather than being placed) at the end of it. I do like the game, it's an interesting concept and once people understand the purpose is to take out as many pieces as possible rather than clearing the board entirely, I think many would enjoy it better. It does scream for improvement, though, most notably with the addition of instructions and fixing the bugs, but it would also be nice to be able to leave the app and have the same game you started waiting for you when you go back into it, especially since it's not timed.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this game adds a new twist to the already fun cut the rope. it is so creative and unique all around good game.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Hard to believe a man of his age can still write with such style, grace and energy.  And, not surprisingly, Carre is always timely in his choice of subjects, in this case governments contracting out services to private companies along with control of the planning and execution of those services.  The author sees this as a growing amorality in Western governments and society in general.  The story line here is riveting.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love it. Easy to use and has not crashed once. Will be using this to sometimes help with words with friends since I don't use the cheat apps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game.  Daughter loves it. Lots of action keeps it exciting. Have to check in often to earn coins and experience.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|The characters were well developed. The plot was interesting and not at all predictable.<br /><br />As a lover of gardening and flowers, I found the messages in bouquets and arrangements were fun and imaginative. Learning something new while being spellbound by the story line is a winner.<br /><br />The emotional  journey of the characters combined with their communication via flowers and plants was refreshing, yet haunting at times.<br />Long after I shut the book, I kept thinking about it....
B0058W74UY|5.0|On my imac Flash Player has always proved reliable. Now, on my new Kindle Fire it is the first app I downloaded.
B008EKOO46|5.0|Jared Diamond again give me a new view point to consider.  His first big book: Guns, Germs and Steel, was written almost as a scientific paper.  Each book since then has gotten easier to read.  In this one, I especially liked the personal stories used to illustrate the different views of traditional societies and today's modern civilization.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|for next book to be released. I love Eva and Gideon's story. I hope that everyone that reads reviews gives this book a chance as I did. I dont understand how this book could get a bad review. I also purchased the narrated version (first time I tried) and I liked that as well. Thank you Sylvia for making me want to read more on the love story of Eva and Gideon.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I recently had to download the new version of kindle.  It downloaded okay, but it syncs and then closes.  I called tech support and was told the new version doesn't support my Coby MID1125 anymore.  I now have a kindle account that I can't use and so my review reflects a site that is worthless to me, as well as a bunch of books that are paid for that I can't read.  I don't get any warm fuzzies from this.  Did the government purchase Amazon Kindle?  The tech said they may be working on a fix and would contact me if this app will support my library.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games to play. time. consuming. I like this app a lot. the games. are addicting.  get this app
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|On the whole, OK. . .<br /><br />On the negative side, this movie departs from the book, for no good reason (e.g, Nicky is in therapy). Also the wild parties of Gatsby are done grotesquely.<br /><br />Still, some of the appeal of the original stays. Just some.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Excellent book for women of all ages. A very true and sad love story. Be prepared to cry ladies its a tear jerker!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first book in this series was excellent. Exciting, fast paced and violent. Then I read the second book...not as good. But still pretty good. I thought the pace would pick back up in this last book, turn into a book like the first one. No such luck, this book was totally boring. It made Dora seem like an action packed adventure. It mainly focuses on katnisses love problems. I never understood the reason for her shooting coin, if their even was one. She was mad with grief and under drugs half the time. One things that really rubbed me the wrong way though was that prim died, and the way she died. Sweet little prim who always made me happy when I read about her, who played such a sweet part in the story up till now, just burnt up. Also the fact that the cat came home, after going through so Much to get their he perk up at the sound of her name, got hit with a pillow and then grieved with Katniss that hit me wrong. Her mom didn't come home with Katniss she stayed in the capitol. Near the end what their was of a story in the first place totally fell apart. Leaving me thinking the story was incomplete and stupid. Dont get this book it is a real wast of money. I can't even express how dissapointed I am with this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good writing and a plot that has twists you wouldn't anticipate.  It kept my attention and I couldn't put it down.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|I love all the movies, but this movie is great, it is very interesting and kept me on the edge on my seat. The people that didn't care for<br />it must not be into the Marvel movies and the actors and actresses. I will add this to all the rest of my Iron Man and Marvel movies I own.<br />If you like or love Marvel movies add this one to yours. I will enjoy this movie for years to come. jo
B000HKYOK0|5.0|First of its kind show from the 60's. This series set the stage for all the great science fiction movies and tv series that followed.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|If you liked the first Ghost Rider you will love this one, I think it's even cooler, a lot of special effects and excitement.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played several bingo games, this tips the best of the bunch. Many different games to play and if you connect to your facebook account you can continue to play on your computer plus get free coins etc when they offer them.
B008JFUR10|5.0|\\"Pacific Rim\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot and an untested trainee - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.<br /><br />The cast led by Charlie Hunnam (as Raleigh Becket), Idris Elba (as Stacker Pentecost) & Rinko Kikuchi (as Mako Mori) is excellent. The directing by Guillermo del Toro (who also produced & co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The story by Travis Beacham (who also did the screenplay) & screenplay by Beacham & del Toro is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Ramin Djawadi is excellent. The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro is excellent. The film editing by Peter Amundson & John Gilroy is excellent. The casting by Margery Simkin is excellent. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny & Carol Spier is excellent. The art direction by Elinor Rose Galbraith, Richard L. Johnson, Andrew Li, Sandi Tanaka & Daryn Wakasa is excellent. The set designs by William Cheng, Rudy Braun, David G. Fremlin, Valdislav Fyodorov, Humberto Garcia, Matt Middleton, Brad Milburn, Sorin Popescu, Andra Totirescu & Evan Webber, set dressings by Toni Wong & Jonathon Stanton is excellent. The costume design by Kate Hawley is excellent. The make-up / creature effects supervised by Francois Dagenais, Jason Detheridge, Steve Newburn & Sean Sansom is excellent. The special effects supervised by Rocco Larizza & Clay Pinney, coordinated by Laird McMurray is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Lindy DeQuattro, John Knoll, Sebastien Moreau, Eddie Pasquarello & Zachary Tucker, coordinated by Paul Alexiou, Joanie Croteau, Ryan Cunningham, Brenda Finster, Rachel Galbraith, Nancy Heller, Anouk L'Heureux, Martine Losier, Karina Mariano, Carol-Ann Ouimet, Jakris Smittant & Mark Van Ee is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Branko Racki (also did the fight coordination), fights coordinated by Racki & Tommy Chang is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent sci-fi action film that is entertaining & interesting. It is also an intriguing (also at times, funny), well-made, well-done and well-crafted film, as well. Guillermo del Toro has made another interesting and intriguing film that is impressive alongside the other films that he has made, thus far. Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba & Rinko Kikuchi lead a solid and well-acted cast, as well, Hunnam & Kikuchi making a solid on-screen team, too. This is one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best sci-fi action films of the year, thus far.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read. It was very quick and always interesting. A little too much crying at some points but the main character is a teenage girl so I guess that's to be expected.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|No character development. No beauty. No plot. And the action sequences were so dull I could not even be bothered to yawn. I would give it five zs, if I could be bothered to stay awake long enough to care. I am just glad I did not bother to spend the time and effort to watch it in the theatres.<br />Ah, well, Angelina better luck next time... I can actually think of one redeeming feature for this movie... iit should be a wonderful cure for insomnia.<br />  It was scripted by Kurt Wimmers, the horror story behind Ultraviolet...an only slightly less awful flick.<br />If you must explore Mister Wimmer's movie watch Equilibrium, an excellent movie, and then spend the rest of eternity avoiding and movie he has anything to do with. Agreed?
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|In the top three movies I have ever watched of all time. Even my wife who hates star trek loved it...she asked me is there another one coming out?
B000054OTY|5.0|One of the great revenge flicks of all time.  It meanders from time to time. But it is definitely one of those films to watch. Brando is, of course, riveting as Rio, as always. It is a shame Brandon never directed another movie. In fact, if I have a criticism of Brandon is that he did not make enough movies. It  seems that the same smoldering performances that made his performances so dangerous and powerful, also, made him difficult and tempermental. Any chance to watch Brando on screen is always a treat, except for Last Tango in Paris, which practically put me to sleep with my eyes open. Feel free to watch One Eyed Jacks, On the Waterfront, or A Streetcar Named desire  to watch him at his smoldering best. And the first two Godfather flicks. Enjoy!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Watched this series many years ago and enjoyed it....watching it again and it is still wonderful! So happy it is available.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I am a Prime member because I live in the country and frequently shop via Amazon but I've found one of the best perks is being able to indulge in marathon viewings of great series like Suits -- without commercials. The ads for it on the TV never caught my interest enough to DVR it; I saw it was highly rated so I gave it a go and was hooked. It is a fast paced blend of law, humor and hutzpah and a great escape. It may be called Suits but the strong women in the series are superbly dressed as well!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I purchased this because it wasn't on Netflix or Huluplus.  So my only option was buy it on amazon so I could stream it through my Roku to my tv.  Great show!
B0095J0AL6|5.0|HAVE NO IDEA!  GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT.  THINK IT IS THE MOST POPULAR GROUP FOR THE TEENS NOW.  THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
0803730470|5.0|Who doesn't love it when the &#34;little guy&#34; comes out on top?  This is one of my grandson's very favorite books.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great addition to the Corssfire series! Sylvia Day added more to the story and left you hanging! Great book and I can't wait until the next one comes out! Great book
B003EVFHYG|4.0|The music is all good, but the best part of the movie, the emotion, is missing from the tracks presented.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Dont get this app if you dont want to get hooked on a great game. It eats up a lot of time because once you start you don't want to quit.  I would recommend it to everyone including kids.
B007N579X6|5.0|Loved this movie, especially when Gru allows himself to have some fun. The 3D was so-so but the story was a lot of fun,
B000JQU1VS|5.0|loved reading these stories again and comparing the original to the &#34;Elementary&#34; version on tv.  Not liking how they merged That Woman with Moriarty- like the book version better.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Many of the courtroom plotlines in this show test one's ability to suspend disbelief, but they are at least entertaining.  What makes this show a winner, though, is the character development. Alicia Florrick's journey as she rebuilds her life after her husband's public disgrace is completely enthralling.  Her complicated feelings for her husband, her relationship with her kids, her flawed co-workers -- this show's writers paint in shades of gray rather than simplistic black and white, and that's what makes this show interesting and great.
B008OOYALE|4.0|good game.... really enjoy it, just wish you didn't have to invite people and have so many friends just to get through.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|The app is okay, I guess. You have fun in the beginning, but there really is not much to do. There needs to be more things to do. On my Kindle Fire, I couldn't talk to him and have him repeat.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It passes the time and is really fun in my opinion. My aunt was the one that recommended it to me. Ever since then its been working fine and smoothly on my Kindle Fire.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show. Very exciting! I can't wait to see season 2. It is very suspenseful and thrilling.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It is a very nice case. It works well for what I need. Hate that I have to have a long winded comment.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite show on tv. I absolutely love this show. Very exciting and it's funny too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its fun to play my sister and me love this game. I think that this game is for all ages. even my mom loves this game she says it a really fun game for all ages
B008MVPGJ4|5.0|These are my 3rd crocs and my favorite by far.  I love the new design.<br />The size is a bit large but all crocs are generally 1/2 size larger than your typical shoes.<br />Other than that these are great looking crocs and very comfortable.<br />I'd buy again and again.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|Being in the military myself, this has always been a highly quoted and referenced movie.  True to Kubrick's nature, it is a powerful and thought provoking movie and one in which everyone can find some meaning and significance.  I forgot from first to second watching that the Gomer Pile piece of the movie isn't actually that long and that there is a lot more here.  For many reasons then, I highly recommend people see this movie at least once.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I know I watched it at least 6 times at the theater as a young teenager.  I cried every time, as I did again after I rec'd this. I have shared it with others who have never seen it before.  Most of them liked it. Even men.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't think that I was going to like the movie. Thought it was more political, but I was wrong. What a great movie. About time someone directed a movie without focusing more on the violence than the plot. Ben Aflect did a great job!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I just read in the news yesterday that this this movie was second in a list of 10 best movies in a decade of moving making. And it sure deserved the credit.  It is full of action and moments of the heart. I am sure others will enjoy as my family and friends have.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Grand Prix is a movie about the turbulent '60's in Formula One...a time I was first learning about and loving the sport.  The actors are believable and the storyline interesting, but the racing scenes and cars are the best!  The special features are well worth watching, and Maurice Jarre's soundtrack is another masterpiece!  Buy it for sure.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I was interested in reading this book due to my medical background.  I love the concept and enjoy how the author relates the use of checklists in several different professions even in professions you would not expect.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I'm glad  I got this...I watched while I was working out, and the workout went much faster!  McQueen is terrific and the driving scenes are the best!
B006S8QY8K|5.0|Yeah, it's a chick flick, but old Chuck has a tender side too. A lot of humor is mixed in. We really enjoyed it as it promotes true, long lasting, dedicated love between a husband and wife, even through the roller coasters that all relationships go through.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fast  Fun in just 60 seconds, you're always looking for the next batch of Jens to remove.  I love the fast pace of the game and you will too.  I get to play against my friends on Facebook also, this adds more to the game.  Try it for yourself.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Better than most of the hidden object games that I have played. Do not expect to play hour after hour unless you plan on spending money. If you are patient then you will have fun.
B008LVCKH6|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book but found that it became very repetitive and frankly, at about 3/4 the way through, I was wishing that it would end.  The main character's experiences, which were quite acceptable and believable due to the easy style of writing, became a bit much and lost their ability to make me want to continue to read this book to its conclusion.<br />Having said that, I never put down a book so I finished it and am sort of glad that I did...but it didn't really hold me through.
B005544V6A|5.0|My wife and I had basically sworn off new television series until we watched this. Its very much must see tv!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|I ave bought many Legos and this one is by far the bet, in addition I have never built a lego that did not have the correct number of pieces. Great QC.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|My young son loves the weather and The Weather Channel was easy for him and me to navigate. Now it's horrible and too busy!
B0067R0APK|2.0|Galaxy Note 2.  The radar maps do not work.  When I try to access that section of the app, I get nothing but a white screen.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Fits well and was easy to install<br />Great base for the RAM x grip holder and extension for my motorcycle.  Hold my iPhone securely.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Let me join the parade and say Tatiana Maslany is an outstanding actress who makes each of her clones a unique individual. The rest of the acting is good too, including her gay brother, hunky but sensitive boy friend, tough step mother and cute daughter. The scripts are interesting, if high on body count. About the only jarring note is the mix of British and America/Canadian accents, but this being the global era we can easily overlook it.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|After debating whether or not to purchase this product I relented, deciding it was a good investment. I am glad I did. This wonderful accessory is small and fits in the same pouch as my smart phone. I love the fact keeping my bluetooth charged, thus allowing an additional 7 hours of talk time. The small expense was well worth it!
B003QTUQGU|5.0|this was a good family movie that we all enjoyed, with a new take on a classic.  typical johnny depp.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Hours and hours of all levels and different style puzzles to wrack the brain with. Don't leave home without it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|the first trilogy was much better.  the main character was good, but we couldn't get into the other characters much.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Not quite the original band, but Gilmour is definitely one of the very best guitarists that ever walked the planet - perhaps the best of the living amongst my favs including Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and BB King.  This live recording has the Polish Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra backing him up and the concert features many great cuts as part of this final appearance of his On an Island tour in 2006.  The DVD is simply awesome, especially when you throw in all of the bonus tracks - I have spent hours and hours listening and watching this masterpiece in my home theaters, never tiring of it!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|You will love the spinster sisters, all the families and how they interact.  The mail mistress is great too and her quirks but very proper
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe in out of body  and near death experiences. Dr. Alexander should have died but didn't. His recovery is nothing short of a miracle. This doctor KNEW that NDEs were impossible before he had his own. Not a well written book but the content is sure to make one think.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book with the caveat would have liked a stronger ending.  Have read many novels on Britain's history and believe this one will have to move to the top of this list for several reasons.  This author has taken some very dry historical fact spanning thousands of years and brought it to life by engaging us with his well developed characters to experience those events in a rich memorable way.  Was a page turner for me and highly recommend Sarum.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Hello. This app is bad. When I shaved her hair down, it just shaved all her hair off. When I died her hair,  it just started over. This is the worst app ever. Plz plz plz PLZ DO NOT GET THIS APP ITS THE WORST!!!!!! I will report every good review and  say yes to bad reviews. Anyways, what's the s***ty freaking point?!?I'd recommend the publisher  of this app delete it. Stickmans better. No game is better than Stickman. Id recommend stickmans better. Plz alot of people download it. GET STICKMAN EPICX NOW! Otherwise, it might get deleted. Well, gotta take my allergy pills. Have a nice day but first, here aare some reasons its bad.  1. Crazy, Makes no sense.  2. Worst ap
B0058D77S2|5.0|We watched as a family.  even though there were some racy moments we felt the kids shouldve not watched overall is was a good pick
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|really enjoyed another g5 game! I especially like how they take awhile to complete instead of being over in five minutes!
1936719118|5.0|This is a great book to teach you about business and about life. Do yourself a favor and get a copy. Keep it by your bedside table and read a little bit each night. It will transform your life.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|ENSLAVED is another great album from Max and SOULFLY....Well, since DARK AGES, Max go back to his THRASH METAL roots, creating AMAZING MODERN THRASH albums like CONQUER and ENSLAVED!!!! Man, if you like the Max style you will love ENSLAVED!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!
0486406482|5.0|Since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is usually considered the most popular of Austen's novels, it is easy to take it as a pattern of her works - a romantic novel.  However, after reading the others and noting the consistent element of comedy and parody, it is realized that that is what Ms. Austen was up to with all of them.  P&P seems the strongest on the romantic element with touches of humor, but \\"Emma,\\" like some of the others, involves the humor much more prominently, with the romantic element being the lighter touch.<br /><br />Throughout the various stories, there appear common features. The heroine is always an unmarried young lady with variations in development and character traits, but always engaging.  The underlying element of the manners and customs of the upper society of the time and its tenets is a constant. Then, aspects of those tenets are played out with various memorable characters.  You will generally find a person of steadfast and mature character, another whose motives and actions mislead until at the end revealed, at least one extremely pompous person, a very talkative lady whose speeches are a marvel, a hypochondriac, a reliable stock of credible worthies along with a delightful variety of idiosyncrasies.  Through it all, the tongue-in-cheek element is very much present.<br /><br />What a diverting way to approach the extremely ponderous and impractical period of upper class \\"rule.\\"  The resultant idleness of such a system among the privileged is perhaps the most entertaining in the exposure of its absurdities.  In this respect, Ms. Austen is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Dickens, who took the lower end of the system as his subject with the purpose of pointing out the ills it imposed upon the lower classes.  Either are representative of a time and custom which, like the Old South in America, while capturing the imagination at either extreme, was a system and style of life that could not endure. Personally, I can appreciate the effortsmade by both of these fine authors in their respective contributions of depiction.<br /><br />Whichever of Ms. Austen's stories is preferred, a reader can always enjoy one or more of the richly drawn characters and certainly the interwoven elements of humor interspersed in each. \\"Emma\\" does take a while to develop, but it is worth the investment in the stage setting period.  As it gains speed, one finds oneself being carried along in true delight to an ironic and satisfactory conclusion.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really interesting look at what life was like during and would be like after a zombie attack. A really great read!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was a touching story of a man who is suffering from a devasting accident and his caretaker from the other side of toen. Emotional.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Really good flick, we were surprised we thought we would like this movie - How many ways can you tell this story - but this was really good the acting was very good. The effects were also good recommend watching in HD.  Little warning this is't a little kids movie.  So follow the suggested rating.  Well worth the money and time.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|It is a very gripping crime mystery-solving game, where you investigate the disappearance of a girl while regaining your memory from amnesia in this rather spine-tingling setting at night, in a seemingly deserted town inhabited by very shady albeit lurking people.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Good movie, good effects best watched in HD.  Would recommend this movie as a good Saturday evening flick.  Not a whole family movie recommend you follow the movie rating.  But a good flick, both the wife and pops enjoyed so make the pop-corn  and enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed it. As Poirot would say, it got my \\" grey cells\\" thinking. It was not very easy, but not too hard either that you could not escape the floor.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game has improved after last upgrade fixed a lot of the problems.  Very good RPG war game without the Drama
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Tom gets a bad rap. Maybe he's nutty otherwise but his acting is not bad in these kind of movies. He even does comedy fairly well.  I wasn't liking the attempt at comic relief as the original series was pretty serious business as I remember. That's why 3 stars instead of 4.  Plot wasn't bad either. Good chase sequences and nail biting fight scenes.  Good functional close quarters combat and not high flying kicks. I was entertained to be sure
B0095MVOMC|3.0|Its ok,  kills time but I'm uninstalling because it can not be moved to my card maybe ill check back on this game later to see if they fixed it!
B006T5C5PS|5.0|The information in this book has been so pertinent to my life because cancer is rife in my family.  My mind is absorbed with learning as much as I can to improve my health and prevent future disease. Thank you Charlotte Gerson for continuing your Father's life work.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|Watched every episode and the show is hilariously amazing and different. Can't wait for season three this fall!!! For now season 2 DVDs will suffice.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is getting better and it has allot of stuff to help. keep working and improving it , live camera's and local info ground soil temperature water temps at lakes near by
B003L77G38|5.0|Just like the rest of the series we have purchased, we were very pleased with this purchase and the condition it which is was shipped to us.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is awesome. I played 100 floors an I think this app is  better than 100 floors! Would be cooler if you had to move your device to solve a puzzle once in awhile.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. Really fun! Highly recommend to anyone who loves these kinds of games and to horse lovers all over!
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|It's been years since I've read a comic. I generally don't like contemporary comics: the stories, the art, the endless reboots and alt timelines. But this is an edgy, brilliant and exciting tale. I can't wait to see how the story ends.
B005603236|5.0|Northanger Abbey is one of my favorite Jane Austen books (P&P, S&S, and Northanger all vie for first place depending on my mood). I saw this film adaptation when it aired on PBS and loved it. It's not an exact replica of the book, but films never are. But this film captures the mood and character of the book exceptionally well, in my opinion. This is well produced, well acted, and well cast. Felicity Jones plays the naivet&eacute; of Catherine and how she manages to be silly yet not at all annoying--really just like in the book. She's determined to find adventure, even if she has to invent it herself. I really enjoyed this film. I recorded it from PBS onto DVD when it aired several years ago, and recently found that I never formatted the disc properly when I recorded it, so it won't play on my new DVD player. I'm really happy to find what other reviewers have said is the FULL, uncut version of the film for such a great price--and on Blu-ray no less. Score!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Maybe we have bad taste, but I am a Bruce Willis fan, and it was better than we expected. An added bit of father-son relationship was a different twist.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|I RATE THE JACKSON 5 A 5 STAR.I LIKE THESE GUYS MUSIC BECAUSE ALL OF THEM SOUND GOOD AND SINGS GOOD.I WILL ALWAYS BUY THEY MUSIC.YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WHEN YOU MAKE A PURCHASES..THIS MUSIC WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO NO MATTER WHAT THE YEAR MAY BE..DON'T MATTER WHAT..THE JACKSON FAMILY MUSIC IS SO DIFFERENT THEN ANY OTHER SINGER'S IN THIS WORLD..YES. I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE...THIS CHRISTMAS CD SOUND GREAT THE MUSIC MAKE YOU SIT BACK AND THINK OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS..I LOVE THIS CHRISTMAS CD. I BEEN WAITING ON THIS CD AND NOW I HAVE IT.. I REALLY LIKE IT..
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great Movie!!!! We missed it the first time around, and plan to see DM2, so we rented this. Well worth the viewing!!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I wanted to view media that required the use of a browser that supported Flash player.  Having read the user guide for Kindle Fire HD, went to Amazon;s App store and purchased Dolphin Browser.  Then opened the dolphin browser to view media needing Flash player to view.  The browser opened and did seem to be working but when it stared the media files they opened but weren't viewable, and my kindle didn't seem to be working normally.  I deleted the dolphin browser from both my device and the cloud.  It seems that Amazon may offer a lot of apps in it's store. but that doesn't mean they work well with Kindle Fire HD.  My advice is to carefully read the reviews and see if you want to proceed.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|We missed this the first time around, and now are catching up with the old Doctors.  I am looking for the series with the Doctor Who wears the very long striped scarf, but this fellow is evidently more modern than he was.  There have been 5-6 Doctors, and the series has been running for 50 years! Fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a great game. But the Vecter Battles are extremly hard. The rest of the game is great.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|I love this movie.  Jodie Foster is so compelling that I felt for her character when Mathew McConaughey's character threw her under the bus in the hearings.<br /><br />If you like a great combination of story and sci-fi, which is based on a very realistic and conceivable arc, then I think you'll like this movie.  It does get a little slow at times, but the overall story is so compelling, I think you'll enjoy it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This games is great it good for my kids and keeps them from fighting. It's so funny too my kids they per there pants
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Seriously...  &#34;Whisper Sync&#34; usually doesn't.  I've had to uninstall/reinstall the software a dozen times, on several devices, to get items to sync.  Tech support doesn't exist, you have to rely on other users in the Amazon forums to help you work out issues.<br /><br />Great when it works, extremely strong argument for books when it doesn't.
B0049WHNLO|5.0|The energy is high, and the music is infectious.  What a great album.  If you like great jazz, you will love this album.
B004RLPTT0|4.0|Grabbed it for a couple of really great tunes from the movie.  Probably 75% of the songs aren't so great, but the other 25% are pretty awesome.  Probably would have saved a buck or two just getting the songs I liked, but what the heck, not a huge loss.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This show is a nice addition to the Sci-Fi genre with its focus on both building and growing characters as well as creating moving plots that connect through the episodes.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Saw the movie and found it interesting.<br />Wanted to see if book was different......?<br />Looked about right and enjoyed it.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Overall an extremely well-written and performed album. I love Anette's vocals and think they add their own story to the music. Previous albums by Nightwish are, of course, very different because of Tarja's operatic vocal style - but both certainly have a top place in my music library.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have better app a Congo of this and temple run. so how 'bout no. nope not installing. no way. maybe if it was something I liked... like temple run...
1612130585|5.0|I LOVED EVERY BOOK! I loved Christian and Ana.  Rollercoster ride,read all three in just a few days. I couldn't put them down. Enjoy,happy reading. Thanks ,Laura
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had this for a while. It is really fun and I would recommend it. Its even better with facebook connected. so good,  especially for free! even better than temple run,  by far! To end my review, I say this- bah-naaanaassss!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the earlier version better.  This version appeared this week, if this was an upgrade, I would like to revert to the version that was running on my Kindle fire.  Is there any way to go back?<br />Nancy B in IN
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It  was everything I expected it to be.  The captioning made it very  easy to understand the British accents. Entertaining
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a must-have no matter what version. Though I was depressed without redstone and the nether, once it updates, it'll be amazing. This is a cheap way to get minecraft, but with a couple of downsides. Overall, 7/10.
B0051ZH6GK|1.0|My wife bought it. She likes it. I don't like it. I like music that rocks. This does not rock. Not my cup of tea at all.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|great book--kept me interested through the entire almost 1,000 pages.  Even though it is fiction, there is a lot of fact based history and it is brought to bear in a very readable format.  I would highly recommend it and can't wait for the third book
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have always liked the weather channel, but I don't like the new layout at all. It seems all over the place.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really love the complexity of this game and the interaction of others players. I just help my father in law to download it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a real nice game, but they keep adding more and more annoying ads and carp to the mix and that's making it a little less desirable.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great addition to the man cave wall of 11x17's my favorite movie of all time! Still to this day I love it.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|Needs to be updated to be the same as the iOS version. Bring the daily challenges, and bring the prices for things like the utility irons more inline with the iOS version.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun and very visual.  And, it has Robert Downey, Jr.  Great for a family movie night.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Has everything you look for from a Bruce Willis movie.  A movie you can watch more then once. I Enjoy it.
0385523394|1.0|I rarely write reviews these days, but couldn't help myself with this one.  Having  known several people in prison for various situations, I found this book devoid of substance, sincerity, and reality.  In fact, as I read it, I had the feeling that the author was documenting her experiences for a future TV show.  Sure enough, I found the series on Netflix and watched a couple of episodes to see if it was as shallow as the book.  Hard to believe, but it was even more so.  In fact, I laughed out loud at the terrible acting, bad writing, and lack of depth of any kind.  Overall, both the book and series are a total waste of time. Piper comes across as a spoiled brat who \\"made a mistake?\\"  Spare me.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|this movie was boring, i mean real boring, dont rent this, i wish i could get my money back<br />even my dad left with 30 mins remaining of the movie
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|One of the greats of the season and I decided to get Amazon Prime just to watch it and Under the Dome (King).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have fallen in love with the series. What an absolute surprise ending of season 3, can not wait for season 4.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The actors make the movie.  Fair writing but Streep and Jones are the keys to this one.  Nice story plot but nothing new.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Only if it remained independent of those that sleep with NSA. Will recommend as it helps monkeys navigate without looking like one.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|An awesome movies with lots of action.  Would like to see more on this line and with as fine or same actors/actresses.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|Doesn't take hits when it should, forgoes blocking the bar, under-emphasizes risk of gammon and backgammon when leaving home space late in game
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Downton Abbey is a good strong series but needs more laughs!  Too much sadness with so much power, control, and money.
1781162646|2.0|I just finished \\"Joyland\\" this evening, and I'll give it an emphatic \\"meh\\".  I never really rooted for the main character, Devon.  He came across as a whiny 21 year old with a broken heart.  Sure, most of us have had our hearts broken, but his heartbreak was a little over the top.<br /><br />** Minor spoilers below **<br /><br />True, Devon saved a couple people's lives, but really, it was more of being at the right place at the right time rather than any heroism on his part.  He was the only qualified person to help them out, and he did his job.  Yay.<br /><br />I liked many of the other characters like his two best friends and the little boy, Mike.  I emphathized with his Mom at first, but then her character became a little annoying and whiny, too.<br /><br />The plot was decent, and I enjoyed the few parts of the story that actually talked about the killer and finding out who he was.  I was even surprised at the end and thought King did a good job leaving everyone in suspense.<br /><br />Plot - 3.5 of 5<br />Main characters - 1.5 of 5<br />Secondary characters - 3 of 5<br />Ending - 4 of 5<br />Carnival lingo - 0.5 of 5 (really got tiring by the end)<br /><br />Finally, what was with the cheap shot at Dick Cheney at the end wishing he were dead?  I don't care if you're an R or a D...that's just plain wrong.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I insist on some type of weather forecasting app on my desktop, my laptop and now I have the Weather Channel app on my Kindle.  Good, reliable info from the Weather Channel.
1781162646|4.0|I took JOYLAND along on a vacation to the Maine coast, and as an avid SK reader, I had high expectations.  The writing is good; the plot predictable.  I have no objection to the book's genre, however.  This was, after all, written for a hard-boiled crime series, and I was never of the \\"King should stick to writing horror\\" persuasion.  (Actually, I think SK's writing becomes better the further he strays from horror/fantasy).  The setting of the book is interesting and atmospheric (a fading amusement park along the Carolina coast), and the main character is rather compelling.  However, the dying child motif becomes maudlin in a hurry, and the novel never really builds suspense.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the show love the actors cant wait 4 the next season!!!!! Hope it has a kool and good ending to the whole show.......
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Great tower game that has lots of playability. For a casual game it really sucks you in and with the many levels there is a lot do in it.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie isn't as borderline as the media made it out to seem. It's plot is simple and extremely predictable, however, hopefully your not watching this movie for a plot. This movie is just for good laughs. I highly recommend this movie. I feel looking back at it in 10 years the 'edgy' material will be slightly less than offensive. Its a great movie that will make you laugh period. Ted is awesome. I hope there isn't a sequel, sequels usually aren't comparable to the first.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game is cool.. but I cant pass the 3rd level.. I'm sure there's a way.. I just gotta be slick.. Def takes skill...  I reccommend it
B009IEXKXI|3.0|A good concept and a possible 'true to life' scenario, but I wanted more fiction action........I still finished the book.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|The story sounded so interesting, but unfortunately it was written so badly that I had to stop reading after 19%.  The grammar, punctuation, and spelling are shockingly bad.  The timeline also didn't make much sense.  Would one really have dark purple bruises weeks after the fact?  And would someone who is so jumpy and battered really allow a complete stranger (man) to examine those bruises?  I don't think so.  It was awkward and bizarre, and just unreadable.  I can't believe this is actually a series.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Tried a few different games of this type. Controls are easy enough and it has great replay value.  This is my favorite. Thanks!
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Yes bit dated , but it set the standard for the spy game genre the cast is a true mix of the culture at the time
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This CD/DVD package is a good deal. The music on the CD sounds very good. The CD cover is like a small record album that opens up to hold the two CDs and one DVD of the concert. There is a small booklet in side of the show. But the best part is the DVD concert. This to me is the best looking concert recorded for McCartney. It looks like you are there watching the show. Some camera wondering to show peoples reactions to the music. Some of the woman more than once. Paul talking to people with signs. John and George are remembered in songs and talk with big screen pictures. And the music is perfect. The version of Jet is the best out of the last three recorded shows. All the songs are done very well. What a great bass player. A well done concert.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think it is a great game but sometimes the loading is slow. I love the fart (not dart) gun. But the vector matches are hard and sometimes you don't know that your wasting you're coins.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Had to keep waiting for it to load.  Play and load.  I love the sarson but waiting for it too load wore on my nerves.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A fine quick read.<br />The book makes one think about what one needs to succeed.<br />Well-written and entertaining.<br />The author has raised awareness of a great mind.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|This one took a few plays to grow on me.  Now I just play it from one end to the other.  There's no song that stands out  but every song is good and together they make a great album.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story that draws you in to the characters and history, with prose that fluidly keeps the pages turning. A fabulous read!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Joss Whedon did the near impossible - bringing together diverse characters from other movies to all work together, and how nicely they did that.  Amazingly well done.
B00C5WR6JE|2.0|Bill  Frisell is one of my favorite jazz musicians and I have many of his recordings. This album is simply not my idea of what pure/real  jazz is. It seems to me that it is wonderful thematic/mood music that would enhance a scenic nature film and leave me wanting to know where the film score came from. On that account I would give it five stars BUT ... it is in my view, not jazz.<br />Kudos to Jenny Scheinman for her excellent violin solos.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Very good movie, that covers it all. I I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys an action packed comedy, w/ a twist of romance.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|The Keith Jarrett Trio is a national treasure. Anyone who knows the music of this trio can instantly identify their individual and collective sound and solos. This recording is simply PERFECT and defines what jazz is to me. It is almost impossible for me to choose a favorite cut on this album but &#34;Somewhere / Everywhere is positively hypnotic and I cant get enough of it.<br />&#34;Tonight&#34; is the perfect selection to follow and makes one wonder how an entire album of the Trio playing &#34;West Side Story&#34; selections would be. Wherever Leonard Bernstein is, he must be smiling ear to ear.This is easily one of the very best piano trio albums to come along in quite a while.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|These quirky characters may be born under a dark star, but the way the author communicates their life experiences keeps it fresh and not so dark as it is believable and satisfying. The characters feel smart and cool without extroverted exclusionary behavior. They deal with life's small annoyances concurrent with the ever present 500 pound gorilla of fate using a balance of humour, annoyance, and intelligent observation that feels real.
6304712936|1.0|This is the second time I tried to buy this DVD.<br />Both times it was bad - missing the last few chapters.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not care for the so-called mystery aspect and was drawn out in a way that just got boring.  Hard to start and finish.

B00C6XBEPY|1.0|Don't make the same mistake I did... wasn't paying attention and quite frankly didn't realize Genesis Revisited II was a DOUBLE ALBUM. So I ended up ordering this ridiculous 'Genesis Revisited II: Selection' -- a single CD with half the tunes and a slightly higher price?!? WTF!!

B001NLKWLW|2.0|Too contrived. skipping around in time  compromised flow of story and introduced irrelevant characters. Never really had a chance to know the key players before I was zipped off to another time and place. I would not recommend this book.

B005PK57NU|5.0|Fascinating show with a lot of insight into the legal world.  The characters feel like real people and after a few episodes<br />I cared about them all.  I watch a couple of episodes every night and look forward to it.  Don't want it to ever end.  But now I'm on season 4 and will miss this one a lot when it's over.  Hope there is a season 5 later on.<br />Sara

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Like James Franco, thought the female casting could have been better - the story was very good, but needed some more evil oomph.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I really love this novel, only Underworld is higher in my personal rating. Quite adult story from point of view of a 7-years old boy is so pretty that I couldn't stop reading even when it was my stop (I read mostly in metro).<br />I would only wish it was a bit longer - it took me only several days to finish the story, considering that English is not my native language.
1939416019|2.0|I don't understand how this book could be given 4 or 5 stars. The author is just trying to \\"sound\\" like great fantasy authors, but it doesn't work at all. A Feast ..., A Clash... Seriously ? You thought we wouldn't notice. If you mix and match the words of the titles you can even have A Clash of Kings ! And I hope \\"Rice\\" is really her name, otherwise it's pathetic. Sadly, this book is not worth it, for all the reasons mentionned by the 177 1 or 2 stars reviews published for the moment.
B000EHSN9Y|1.0|One beautiful day, this product decided to give up. I've this for 18 months, daily use. Looking out for a replacement now. For $19.99, I would expect to use this device couple more years. 2 stars

0062059963|4.0|I received an ARC of this book from Jenna Does Books, the awesome blogger I've gotten to know better over the last month or so! Thanks so much!<br /><br />The Elite by Kiera Cass takes place right after The Selection. We meet up again with America, who is surprised she's falling for the handsome Prince Maxon, and also is torn because her last love, Aspen, has become a guard in the palace. Maxon has narrowed down the pool to 6 women, and America thinks that she's a sure thing until Maxon starts to develop feelings for some of the other girls. At the same time, she struggles with her feelings for Aspen and her feelings that she doesn't have the cruelty in her to become a bona fide princess. Will she stay or will she go?<br /><br />I know a lot of people had mixed feelings about this book, and I totally get that. But I liked that it was a fun, fast paced read, with more character development of Prince Maxon (who is totally hot) and more insight into America's thoughts and character. I also liked the development of some of the other girls. I thought it was rather one sided in the first book that Maxon would only like America out of all of them, especially when she kept pushing him away or not \\"deciding.\\" I thought it was only fitting that he start developing feelings for other people. I also loved all the bits about America and her family, especially her little sister and her father. YAY! Finally a YA father that is AWESOME! I also admired America's strong beliefs about friendship and family when faced with her beloved falling off his pedestal. She also does a lot of growing up in this book-- she realizes that all her perceptions are not always right and that people do things for reasons that she doesn't always know about.<br /><br />Why I wasn't head over heels for this book: I don't really like love triangles in general. And Aspen's a pretty weak choice in comparison to Maxon. He brutally dumped her in the first book for reasons that I know he explained but I still don't understand, and now he's moping around with her stealing kisses from her (which by the way, I think is Cass's way of having us be okay with Maxon kissing other girls too, which worked for me). I just wish that there were no love triangle, and instead of a physical representation of Cass's indecision about old life versus new life, she would actually just have those feelings without the actual person. That said, then I'd be pretty mad at Maxon for messing around if America were perfect. And she has a whole third book to get to that point.<br /><br />Overall, a fun read, and an intriguing one. I'll definitely be sticking around until the end.n't understand, and now he's moping around with her stealing kisses from her (which by the way, I think is Cass's way of having us be okay with Maxon kissing other girls too, which worked for me).

1781162646|4.0|This book seems to be three different books that were combined into one. The first half is about boy meets girl, falls in love and has his heart broken. The second part is about boy helping others, and the third is about said boy solving a murder mystery. Overall, it's a good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this better then the one on the computer. Highly recommend for everyone. I also use it every day.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|...the first half dragged, in typical King fashion.  Too much of the back story & build up were totally unnecessary.  I had to slug through and even skipped pages.<br /><br />The second half took off like a bullet and kept me glued to the pages.  I honestly could not put it down.  And the historical accuracy....AMAZING!  I'd just finished the non-fiction novel, &#34;Four Days In November&#34; which went into extreme details of the Kennedy assassination and the following three days.  King got it all right on the money, even down to utilizing minor non-fictional characters.  I give the second half FIVE stars!!!!
0385349947|5.0|A book that combines research with personal experience and advice for women and men(who want a diverse and inclusive work environment) in the workplace. The author knows what she is talking about and tells things as they are about where women are at this point in the workplace, the challenges we face and how we can overcome them. She acknowledges her critics but argues in favor of her right to speak from experience and does so in a way that is both informative and interesting.
B002M87W9K|5.0|Robert Preston is THE music man. What a great performance. I love this movie. If you like musicals, you will too. Great story and wonderful study of human behavior. It's great to see the life of a narcissistic, bull crapper con man redeemed by the love and faith of a woman and town transformed by the &#34;think&#34; theory.
B00164GDA0|5.0|I remember watching this as a teen/young adult and it was my husband's favorite movie, so I bought it for him. However, my sons loved it too.  Just the right blend of mystery and drama.  Makes you miss River Phoenix
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very inspiring. I could definitely tell the author pored his heart in to this book. I literally cried at the end of the book.
B00511N78U|5.0|Two of the most deftly handled, didn't-see-it-coming, plot twist oriented movies in one dvd at less than the price of Primal Fear purchased separately. Tremendous!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Growing Up I loved the show and re-watching them on blu-ray is the best. This is the best season out of the first three, and I can't complain on the swift service and quick delivery to my home. Amazon always delivers.

B007SPPANM|3.0|This is a great movie. bought it for my daughter. But the disc skips several times near the end of the movie. I have not had very good luck with dvds that i have bought on line.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Even though there are frequent references to sexual encounters (referred to as coitus) it is generally a family friendly show and many of the sexual references will go over younger kids heads.  Light, fun, short -- all important for family viewing

B0053O89XI|5.0|We started watching the Big Bang Theory a couple of seasons in and so were glad to be able to purchase previous seasons.  But we enjoy re-viewing the shows we already saw -- little bits of humor slip by the first time -- and the character development is fun to see.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|the good wife is the best there is.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|WOW  is the only word that I can think of to describe this book.  Sylvia, I am hoping there is another book to follow this one.  FAB-U-LOUS!
B001BNFR6W|2.0|Some of the discs are scratched or blured, and it's suppose to be brand new. They are still playable I haven't encounter any problem with any of the discs, yet. That's why I treat them so carefully so they will get to still play on my dvd eventhough they are clearly damaged. Maybe NBC will put this series out in Blu-Ray like FRIENDS, we will have to wait and see.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|After everything I had read and heard about this book, I really thought I would hate it. But, I found myself nodding my head in agreement, saying &#34;yes! me too!&#34; and &#34;been there, done that&#34; throughout the book.<br /><br />Sandberg's basic message rang very true for me and made me look at my career in a different way. Having worked in corporate America for over 15 years, I could really relate the messages in this book.  It got a little repetative towards the end, but other than that, I loved it!
B000YJ6736|5.0|I picked up this book to read because it was mentioned in another book I was reading.  I wasn't sure if I would continue to like it as I kept on readying and reading.  It is very provocative and I am actually thinking about retreading it once again.  Knowing the outcome might put the story in another perspective. N

B0078XFYDA|5.0|Just as this book sets out to do, it teaches the science behind a huge array of things we find in the natural world, and does so in an easy to follow, clearly explained way.  The purpose of the book is to bring the wonders of our natural world to people who don't grasp the science behind it, and explain that science in a way that's as easy to grasp as possible: no math, no need for the memorization of theories and formula.  Just bring a willingness to learn, and you will do so.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest two attributes of this book are: (1) You can skip around all you want to the parts that interest you most, and (2) Dawkins sets up a general format and flow for each chapter, but breaks it when necessary, to keep things interesting and to address subjects like &#34;here's what we DON'T know about the universe.&#34;  These traits make the whole of the book even greater, showing great diversity in Dawkins ability to tackle widely different subject matter, and allow the reader to breathe and get away from &#34;standardized formatting&#34; that can kill the momentum of reading about such subjects.<br /><br />I daresay that books like this should be standard classroom reading for younger students, perhaps at the middle or high school level.  While we always need our text books to teach the theories, theorems, formulas, and more detailed history of biology, chemistry, physics, anthropology, and so on, combining dry texts with works like this show why that information is worth learning, and provides real-world, immediate application of scientific principles to show us how and why the world works the way it does, and how we can improve ourselves by learning and understanding that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it, can't wait for the new series.<br />Why can't the US produce a wholesome series for families to watch.
B006YFOOFW|5.0|this book turns out to be an excellent distillation of the deepest spiritual truth of which all mystics in every religion speak.  tolle reminds me most of the zen masters because he talks about that which is beyond mind & how to get there from wherever you are in life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have a horse I good to learn groom it and anything else and a lot of people really don't do things like this it really helps
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's fun to compete with friends and compare high scores.IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! If you like temple run you will love this!!!!!!!! &#60;&#60; written by my children :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a refreshing, touching, and heartbreaking story!  I admit that it might still be a little melodramatic and a bit juvenile but I still enjoy and love EVERY BIT of it!  I'm so tired of the vampire/wolf/tiger/magic themed YA novels and so exhausted reading novels that have multiple sequel.<br /><br />I really appreciate stories that have depth and deal with more serious subject but not taking itself too serious and this book is definitely one of them. I LOVE most of the characters and adore the main guy.  He might look just like all the handsome delicious guys described in every single YA story but there is definitely a lot more to his appearance.  I actually don't feel much about the main girl though she is still a lot better of a character than Bella (twilight) but maybe not as stand out as Katniss (hunger game). Maybe these are not the best comparison.  But she does have a unique personality that I can't relate but I can definitely appreciate.<br /><br />Hopeless has a very compelling storyline and I especially applaud the way the story was developed and unfolded.  It's clever and definitely well thought-out. The relationship between the main characters matures in a more realistic pace.  It's sweet and subtle.  I do wish to see more details on the relationships between other people. It would have been nice to have more of that instead of the extra love scenes. The ending was strong and satisfying (comparing to many other YA books I read that is) although still a bit convenient and predictable. Regardless I would still highly recommend this book!
B002ZG997C|5.0|This might be my favorite movie of all time and it was in great condition when it arrived to me.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I have had this controller since 2011. Right from the start all the buttons were stiff, the triggers weren't really triggers they were more like buttons and the battery didn't last that long. Now, I had never owned a PS3 controller before so I didn't how it was supposed to feel and how long the battery lasted. I figured the buttons were stiff because it was still new. 2 years later it's gotten even worse. The analog sticks are unusable, the triggers have a crazy dead zone, and battery dies within hours. So how do I now for sure this a fake?  Because I just went and purchased a new official Sony one from the Target and its night and day. Also if you compare the build quality of a real PS3 controller vs one of these you will notice obvious differences along with the fake controller feeling much heavier. This is a complete rip-off!!<br />Again, DO NOT BUY!!!!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This movie is great, I think I've watched it 10 times since I've gotten it! It came in really good condition as well.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|This movie was so funny, and I do not normally find these types of movies funny. Knowing about politics makes the movie even funnier!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Flat out:  He was just too blown-away with himself.  It seems that there could have been more on the experience itself.  It could have been so much more than it was and I was disappointed I paid money for it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I am going to make sure I get a digital copy when I buy a movie.<br />This movie is absolutely adorable.<br /> I love the girls and steve is wonderful with them.!
B001E45XT4|4.0|The sound quality with these is great but they're not that easy to adjust and they make my head kind of hot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a great game that makes you use your brain! I can not wait until there are more levels to play!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It has a large variety of genre choices, and it is easy to use.<br />Awesome!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great app!! Keeps your mind at work &amp; lots of strategy involved. My whole family loves it..sometimes we have to put two minds at work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun and you  earn lots of coins per run! It's a great game for a rainy day or just any day! I considered it &quot;an exercise for your fingers &quot;LOL!
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|The vampires with needle like canines, the ware wolves changing to human form fully clothed (or the other way around with fur growing over clothes), the awkwardly written corny fight scenes, or the lame love square (instead of triangle) made the read torture to finish. I read it after seeing the movie trailer, but now I don't think I will go see the movie- I can't imagine how they will manage to clean up all the holes in the story. At least I didn't by the book sequels in advance.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the best of all the series. I had a hard time putting this book down. It's so good!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|This move can move you from the worst mood into a really good mood. You can't help but feel good watching this movie.
B005PK56TA|1.0|Seems to be well acted, just not looking for the subject matter. Very hard edged horror. Guess I should have realized from the title.
0061148512|5.0|I'm not an avid reader and most books do not keep my attention. This book was different. It was fast-paced. It was choppy. It was raw. It was honest. It was a stream of consciousness that beautifully pulled me in to the world of Esther and kept me in an almost perfect balance of confusion and understanding. Esther's thoughts are relatable, whether you suffer from a mental illness or not. I do indeed suffer from several mental illnesses and I found myself nodding and agreement and chuckling at her wit several times throughout the book. Let me repeat that I am not easy to please.<br /><br />Esther's life has been defined by scholastic achievements and she finds herself, after a disappointment, spiraling into a new world where she cannot find her place. This young lady is cynical, clever, sarcastic and was destined for success. This is not a weak woman. This is a woman struggling to survive. This is a woman using every weapon at her disposal to fight off the beasts of mental illness yet continually finding herself at the mercy of her own mind, betrayed by her own being.<br /><br />If you are expecting a plot with a beginning, middle and end, where everything is resolved, this is probably not for you. However, if you would like a brutally honest insight into a troubled mind, you will not regret accompanying Esther on her fascinating journey.<br /><br />5/5.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Most people say How to Train Your Dragon was their favorite of Dreamworks' films, &#34;Rise of the Guardians&#34; was my favorite of Dreamworks' films! This film brought back memories of my childhood with these mythical characters we all know and love ! I also love the idea of a film being centered on children since I love spending time with kids.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book keeps you guessing at every turn so you keep reading to try and figure out what is going on. Great take on relationships and the power of words.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I purchased this movie for a friend. I have seen it several times but did not buy it. Funny and very moving.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good cast! Alota action! Carl Weathers, \\"Action Jackson,\\" should have been in it instead of Terry Cruse.I loved it!  Mayme he will be in the next chapter.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Used for work voip calls.  Liked the features pretty well, but the mic arm now shorts out the headset, first just when raised or lowered now whenever I try to use.
B009EEKTUY|4.0|One of the best casts anyone could want.  A country so dramatic it leaps off the screen.  A period in history almost unknown to anyone outside of Australia.  It should have been an epic film.  Unfortunately it also has continuity errors as long as your arm, history errors, poor match move and CGI and mistakes that wouldn't be made in film school such as using the black and white 1955 version of Wizard of Oz instead of the sepia tone of the original 1939 movie.  Apparently it was never story boarded so you don't have a story arc, you have a story kangaroo of Donovan's Reef meets The Man From Snowy River while riding past The Rabbit Proof Fence.  It is a tribute to this great cast and the sheer power of the story that even Luhrman's sloppy direction can't ruin a basically enjoyable film well worth re-watching.  You can only be disappointed by what might have been.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a very challenging game, fun for everyone. It makes you stop and think. You want to keep going. It's hard to stop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|despicable me: minion rush is a good game to play if your 7 or 80 year old. so you must play it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome. like the challenge of each room. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes challenging puzzles.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is really great, difficult at certain parts, but otherwise a worthwhile purchase.  A definite guaranty to killing some time, and having a great deal of fun.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|I would watch this movie over any over again. It is full of of action and adventure. I would recommend this movie
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I don't like games like this. My grandson thought that I would and he is the one that got it for me. Absolutely awful.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|It has taken me a long time to watch the 4th installment of this series. The first one...okay, the second...marginal, the third...not so good and the fourth...just a waste of time. I was hoping by now that it would have been added to the Prime collection, but alas, no. What a ridiculous movie and I only can hope that they will not waste their time on a fifth installment. I won't waste even the $4.99 to rent it, let alone watch it if is made and eventually added to Prime. Enough is enough. You should have stopped after the second installment.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|You have to have an account with Facebook in order to play this app. Not for me. I don't do Facebook.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If there was more action involved without having to buy stars and hearts I would enjoy it more. I like the variety of things to do and buy
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game and I even have my sister hooked. We bought her a Kindle Fire and she loves it, plus she loves this game. She then decided to get all the other free Angry Birds. Amazing is all I can say. Thank you grandson for helping me get this game.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|The quality of this DVD is very good.  The sound quality is excellent, and the subtitles are clear and easy to follow.  I especially like how this video shows some of the behind the scene footage, such as singers' entrances and exits.  One doesn't normally get to see these things unless he is in the production.  I highly recommend this item.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This was a greta movie, and has a great plot. i heard all the negative reviews, but as a die hard fan, ive never been disappointed. and certainly was not here. so i watched it, and man Bruce, thumbs up brother. again. i was entertained. i knew watching, the only, really un realistic aspect of the plot, was tearing up Moscow traffic, and not having a million Moscow police and Army descending on there ass in 2 minutes flat. besides  that, its a great movie with a good plot. thanks Bruce.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|I had no idea what to expect going into this book.  What a surprise! So many outrageous characters in this story, but of course, Ignatius J. Reilly takes the cake!
B0012GMX3I|5.0|This is wonderful. I have played it all through this wet season which has lasted weeks.I had the old record album but couldn't play it without a turntable. I am really happy that I found this on Amazon. The songs are delightful.
1401900526|5.0|Great item!<br />Love all the inspirational messages on the cards and I appreciated that the seller had a look inside option for this item.  That was the selling factor for me
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I think this game is pretty much worth spending some time playing. It might be just another ordinary point-and-click or touch-and-drag, in this case, but it was quite fun. Not very long though
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Not all I thought it would be. Not as entertaining as advertised. Everything good about this movie is in the trail or.
B00992CF6W|4.0|here's the thing it good but it stinks. because its not fully updated in the pocket edition.and I'm sure soon people agree. so UPDATE IT FULLY PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|First, it was my fault for buying this. It was an impulse purchase and I didn't read the details carefully ahead of time. But, this is a Disney product, I believe their brand stands for high quality and good value. This Movie and especially this edition of the Blu-ray do not meet my Disney level expectations.<br /><br />3d Edition:<br />This edition ONLY has the 3d version on disc. Most Disney movies come in a graduated dvd, dvd+digital, dvd/blu-ray/digital, blu-ray/3d/digital configuration. Without thinking, I was expecting more.<br /><br />There are NO special features on the 3d disc. There are apparently some extras on the digital download, but that will be another few hours to download on my slow DSL connection. This is why I buy movies vs. rent. I want to watch the extras, I am fascinated by how movies are made and how stories are told.<br /><br />Also strangely, this edition decided that 2.0 stereo was the mix it would pick. It even warned me it was picking this; I had to stop the movie and switch audio tracks (I have a nice home theater setup. The DTS audio was no problem; and almost every blu-ray I've put in picks out DTS by default).<br /><br />If anyone from Disney reads this, let me be clear. I will not make the same mistake next time. If you try to pass off a full price (nearly $30) version of this movie with discount bin features (no extras, no additional versions of the movie) I won't buy it - even if it is a movie I really want to see. That is what RedBox is for (Hey Amazon, discourage Disney from putting out low rent editions, I am willing to pay for commentaries, extras and special features).<br /><br />The Movie:<br />Wasn't so good. But then taste is a fickle thing. Gave some back story to the classic Wizard of Oz; was only OK in execution. Didn't hold my attention (the 3d filming on this was strange, angles, gimmicks and distracting). Nor did it hold my 6 and 10 year olds' attention; they decided to go off and play with Lego instead.<br /><br />If I had to do it all over again, I would rent the movie, then move on with my life.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Its been a while since I really enjoyed a new mystery series. Most seem so formulaic. Walt Longmire is a sympathetic, charismatic sheriff of a Wyoming County. Since its an area of the country I've visited only once many years ago, the book is also satisfying informative. Not a happy ending, but there is the satisfaction that the story goes on.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The oft jaded have chosen to give Pacific Rim lackluster to dismal reviews. At first glance the easily distracted may miss the many facets of this finely honed diamond. Senor Del Toro will often use a child's eyes to illustrate wonder, awe, and in this case terror and loss to great effect. He manages to keep the films movement consistent and still displays a deep level of character development. In other words who are these people and do we give a damn, the answer is yes we do. Most kaiju movies alternate between slow moving plot development and blasts of action. Should you go see this in a theater, absolutely. Should you view it more than once yes you should. Did Senor Del Toro get to make in the mountains of madness no, but he did get to make a HP Lovecraft inspired giant robot movie and thus redefine and reinvigorate the genre at the same time. Fans of Idriss Alba will not be let down. The acting is good, fun and accessible. I came to get down and they got down.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This thing really works. I tried the radroach from the Fallout series... he guessed it in 8 turns. When I got the game it didn't work at all. They updated it so now it's exactly like the computer version.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Whenever I have some down time I play this game.  It is a lot of fun, and I enjoy the distraction from my other chores, I feel that I get some play time in during the day whenever I want.  Good fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this escape game. I will recommend it to everyone I see. It is an awesome puzzle game that keeps my brain active
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This should be rated R the Language is terrible, not a family movie.  Terrible, no plot.<br />It is not worth a rental!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great hidden objects game!! LOOKING FWD TO the next one!! Thumbs up!!! Keep up the good work
B004I8WD7S|5.0|These case is superior to the more expensive one that I purchased with mr IPhone.  It feels nice and definitely protects the phone.  I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all three seasons in a week and was hooked immediately. The show's casting is awesome and they blend nicely. Didn't like how they killed off some characters but it gives different story lines. Can't wait till the fourth season starts!!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|really enjoyed in HD and with 24 hour prime rental  we did watch twice but our TV in bedroom finally gave up the ghost and moved on after 7 years of service with never a glitch ,it was JVC brand 42&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Medium hard with funny characters that look just like on the movie. I will be playing this game.and having fun with it for some time to come. My daughter also loves it that's how I found it...good luck!!!!
B0049U4NQO|5.0|The book incorporated so many previous characters you forget about for an explosive ending. took two days to finish. Amazing to keep such calm rising intensity .and to make Alex invincible until this book age and underestimation could not hide him any more  great series can't believe it's over
B001GA1RFA|3.0|A good read but my least favorite John Greene novel so far. I liked paper towns and the fault in our stars much better.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|First of all, I love this game. Kind of a bummer that you don't get the same experience you see on iPad but I'm sure Halfbrick had a reason for that.<br /><br />I have been playing since I bought my Kindle Fire HD and have bought just about everything. I saved in-game money for a week to buy the most expensive item available. Then I bought all the vehicle upgrades and have had them all for almost a month now.<br /><br />I died in a game, and when  I started a new one I noticed I didn't have the vehicle upgrades I had purchased long ago. I figured it was just the same bug that turns off all my purchases periodically, so I went to turn back on the upgrades I worked for. That's when I discovered my upgrades all the sudden hadn't been bought. After a week of saving in-game money, they just un- purchased themselves in between games. If you are going to play this game, don't bother saving up for things. They'll just decide later on that they don't want to be owned and all of the sudden the things you bought are gone.<br /><br />Definitely don't spend money on this game, since it is an option. I wouldn't even think about it until the team behind this game has fixed the issues.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Downton Abbey is still a great series...and well worth watching...but Season 3 tailed down a bit.  It just wasn't quite as good as Seasons 1 & 2!!<br /><br />I don't know what the future will hold for the series...I just hope that it can return to the same level of script writing and acting that was delivered in Seasons 1 & 2.
B00CIS1OKW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, the cast was great, the story was excellent, very entertaining, and had a lot of potential!!!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anthony Ryan's book, Blood Song, is well written and very engaging.  It is a fantasy story that is sort of like &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; by Patrick Rothfuss, but a bit darker.  The characters are well-developed & the book reads well throughout.  I will buy the next book when it comes out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles were great, graphics were great, and the story line was great. A few hours of mind bending fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is so fun and it is so addicting I could play all day long it's so fun<br /><br />And addicting
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Delightful movie!  Maggie Smith is always the best and she is joined by a powerful cast of characters some of whom are actual musicians.  This will appeal to the older crowd, of which I am one, but it is a wonderful film.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|way better than the series! i recommend it to anyone who like the genre!<br />dont get too attached to any charcter...
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|MINI REVIEW: John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back but unfortunately the plotting is clumsy, the characters are monochromatic and the creators try to cover up those flaws with a lot of distracting action sequences and the like. The father and son relationship was decent to above average and that was arguably the best character section of the flick. I can't say I'll be looking forward to the next installment. Sooo, a good day to kill the franchise? OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: C to C plus.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't believe that they have two characters gone in one season now and waiting to see what will come next.
B005544TRQ|4.0|From time to time the stars line up and the right combination of writer,director, characters and actors come together for something really interesting. It's a rare event but nice to stumble into when it happens.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|I have seen the original version of this movie and thought this one was just as good. Waiting for the next installment to see if they can continue to cover the book well.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest update erased stored locations..first strike.  It is now full of ads and &quot;offers&quot; to reward you for doing things....strike two.  I can't easily find the forecast or anything other than current temp.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|I didn't have the opportunity sit and watch this all the way through, all at once. So I think it's way better to watch this one from start to finish, wonderful twist at the end.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|no being penalized. Makes one think a bit but just put things together. Hints could go faster but I'm. impatient!  Five stars + from me!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I'm using it on my Kindle. The screen fills up the Kindles, so it's very easy to spot what you're doing. It works!
B00499NHLC|5.0|something my old man and i both like.  i love both lead actors.  it's wicked fun to watch.  if you liked shows like 'veronica mars' and 'firefly' i suspect you will like this, too.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Good movie, but can get slow at times. I do recommend for families who are not to sensitive to occasional violence.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Saw it in the theaters in the XD with 3D and was amazed.  One of the first movies that for me really did 3D right.  Simply amazing.  Saw it again on my brother's 3D TV in his living room and was once again amazed.  Shocked might be more the word I am looking for.  Made me want to go out and buy a 3D TV on the spot.  Talk about advertising for 3D.  Especially the big combat scene near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Leaving behind the 3D, one of the things that stands out to me the most here is that it is a fairly large ensemble cast all things considered.  Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Capt. America, Hawkeye, etc...  And yet it felt like each character got the &#34;proper&#34; amount of time on screen.  None of them felt like an &#34;also ran&#34;.  This is a truly difficult thing to achieve.  Especially with characters like Iron Man, with 2 movies under his belt, and actors like Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />It also felt like no one character was really carrying the movie.  They all had their roles to play.  The interplay between the characters was fun and interesting to watch.<br /><br />Bottom like the writing was excellent, as was the acting, and couple those 2 factors with the amazing visual elements and it was just a fantastic and fun movie.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|*notes: 1. I am a nerd/geek writing this review so bear in mind the perspective. 2. I am only reviewing the movie, not the seller or dvd, as I watched this movie on TV.* COOLEST. MOVIE. EVER. I have not geeked out over a movie in...well just about forever. The visual effects were stunning, the music rocked (the soundtrack is 100% Daft Punk) the costumes were all kinds of cool... Just wow. Nerdy wow. However, I will side with people saying the story isn't amazing. It isn't. This is not so much a movie to watch for the story, but for the looks. The best way I can describe this movie is a geeky visual feast. I only have 3 Critiques -<br />1. Clu's motion captured face looks less and less believable the longer you look at it.<br />2. The cgi feels a bit excessive is a few places in the games scenes towards the beginning of the movie.<br />3. The ending - a little too sad and final for my tastes. No idea where they're gonna take the sequel.<br />Still 10/10 will watch again (and again and again and again) and will recommend. Also, Sam Flynn is quite attractive.
B000QUEHNK|5.0|beautiful! it doesnt feel like a novel; reads like a story shared by a friend. i love the easy,  natural prose. the characters are incredibly lifelike. ive never heard of this author. found this while looking up Salmon Fishing in Yemen. on a hunch, I decided on this book instead. i made the right choice.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have a kindle fire, the app doesn't work. It gets stuck at different times during its initialization and then just closes
B0091WNK8M|3.0|disney type fare with some amusing moments, if it is raining and the younger kids are bored, this should keep them captured for a bit
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Best English study bible in the world, highly recommend this for the new believer or seminary grad. Great to have as a reference or general devotion.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC should stand for<br />Bold, Bad-ass and Courageous. None like the CNN (lame) coverage. I like the international news. !!!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I have been a fan since rage for order but have been let down with every album after empire. Honestly I haven't even heard some of their recent albums..just sampling the songs I lost interest. It appears they needed the refreshing change with their new vocalist. The change is worth it! This CD rocks! This band is so talented and it is awesome to hear them play what they are capable of! I only wish the songs a bit longer, but this is a great cd. Definitely check it out if you like this bands earlier material.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Pulled you in. Ending not exactly what is expected. Never maudlin. Eventually uplifting. Written<br />With empathy for all the characters in the book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|But, had a hard time putting this one down too.  Enjoy this author and story, for a war book very addicting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy games that like this. Cant wait for more!  Tried a similar app for my kindle but it crashed.  No problems with this one.  I like the graphics and the sounds.
B009WUBERW|3.0|There was really a lot of violence in it.  All the actors looked really older. it ended good  and would watch it again.
B00006JDVV|2.0|This is not for those who like Disney-like stories with happy endings.  The dragons were believable but menacing and destructive.  I like happier tales.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|great movie. kids did a good job. Great ethical lesson learned about prejudice. Glad the kids got the jewels.d would watch it again.
1455523003|4.0|This book was my first exposure to Christopher Hitchens, and all things considered, I wasn't disappointed or offended. To start off with, I'm not a particularly religious person but I do have a very personal distaste against atheists (sorry, \\"Humanists\\"), as well as a deep hatred for socialists. All that being said, Christopher Hitchens, in spite of falling squarely into both categories, brought the perfect amount of sarcasm, cynicism and precision to his statements that were necessary to write this book.<br />  The purpose of this book was mainly to place a very unflinching light on Mother Teresa and any controversies she may have been linked to directly or indirectly. In addition to that, Hitchens makes a sort of secondary objective to smear affiliated Christians in general; Malcolm Muggeridge (of Anti-Python fame: he's scrutinized for his documentary covering Mother Teresa in this book and the \\"miracles\\" he claimed to have captured on film), the Vatican (the reasons for why they were hesitant to make Mother Teresa a saint: verifications of miracles, ultimately proving his point of \\"atheism rules!\\") the Pope (why not?) and others. Hitchens criticizes Mother Teresa for her charity organization's absolute lack of effort in providing quality medical care, points out their massive accumulation of donations that should have been spent on better care for these centers and (while admitting that she is a primitive public-speaker: an insult I smirked at) had enough of a clue to know better. Moreover, he assesses any counter-argument stating \\"her heart was in the right place\\" or \\"she comes from a humble background, she doesn't know any better\\" as being invalid. The best illustration of this latter point and (dare I say it) most important part of this book is regarding the Keating donation to Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. It summarizes Mr. Keating's fraudulent activity, reprints both Mother Teresa's clemency request and the letter the prosecution wrote to her gently explaining the origin of Mr. Keating's ill-gotten gains and how a percentage of it ended up in her charity's fund and offered to help her return it to the appropriate people, and ends with her total lack of response.<br />  I initially read this book with a very neutral attitude, which the writing seemed to cater to. I was also happy that Hitchens kept his own atheistic retributions against religion as a whole to a minimum (there were a couple of parts where he started to whine along the lines of \\"the Pope gets five books deals a year for books that aren't even written by him, yet the ex-nun's expose can't get a publisher?!\\"), as most of his criticisms of Mother Teresa were strictly based on her neglect or her motives. Overall, I think it illustrates that just because somebody is doing \\"charity work\\" in the name of \\"religion\\" doesn't mean that they are free from liability or public scrutiny.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This was probably the besy of the Star Trek movies.  Could watch it over and over and not get tired of it.  Proves the way the world is using up its natural resources.
B00AK57N00|3.0|It's kinda fun and the game looks it too, however even with wind and gravity it can get boring when you play it long enough.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been playing magic since beta when we used to play for anty, back before artifacts came out, and this has the same feel as the early trading card game, when there weren't any other games like this.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie. Everyone should watch it! I think I need to get myself a minion! That is all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Different than your typical King novel, but an amazing story!!! You will not be disappointed. Worth every page that has been written
B00622BMOS|4.0|I watched ER several years ago and grew weary of the setup.  Thus, when I started streaming Grey's Anatomy, I was sceptical of enjoying another teaching hospital story.  To my surprise, the characters and plot were unique enough to shock the dead genre back into life--I enjoy this show just as much as I did ER back in its heyday of Dr Ross, Green,  Carter and Benton.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I hate the ads but love the game. It a good time killer. I like taping it instead of sliding the jewels over because it makes it easier for me to score.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I just finished this book, and was so sad to see it end.  The unnamed narrator walks you through a challenging childhood where you live through successful (and unsuccessful) coping attempts.  A great read.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins' novels are a sure fire excellent read!  You don't need to read the inside cover to decide to read his books.  His name is enough to insure you will enjoy the story!
B003G4W49C|5.0|An amazing read...  a great story told with articulate writing.  I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Lost ability to upload pictures. Other functions freeze Android screen many times a day. Not being able to upload pictures is not helping my budiness!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was completely surprised by this book and series.  It is well written and engaging.  Through the eyes of a teenage a girl, this series touches on social, political, and economical issues present in the real world in this dystopian love story.  Characters and deep and well-written.  There are no clear good and bad guys and characters are complex, each with their own agenda.  I look forward to the conclusion of this series.  I highly recommend.

B000O14VAU|5.0|I'm a fan of sy-fy, so this fits into my likes. It's one of those movies I'll watch again and again.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|An enjoyable read, I hope Richard Castle continues to write the Nikki Heat novels they are fun and entertaining to read.
B002RI9QJE|2.0|The book though starts off well, gets really boring midway. Has few good takeaways. Can give it a shot if you don't have anything else good to read.
B000ID1J40|4.0|This movie is well made and enjoyable, though i can hardly call it critical.<br />The good parts : Redford and gang make a charismatic and entertaining team of legal conmen. The personalities are well rounded for such a movie, and though a bit caricatured, all of them are respectfully portrayed. The manner in which they work with one another is entertaining to watch, though there are no surprises on the inter-relational level.<br />The concept is as plausible as can be expected for a thriller of this type, and as long as that is accepted, a good time will be had. If you feel like dissecting the actual technological side of things too much annoyances will occur, but reality would be less cinematic, so it's best just to let it slide. (If you happen to have that decryption device be sure to let me know as soon as possible!)<br />I really can't call it a suspenseful thriller, since the good guys are too obviously good and the bad guys too obviously bad to cast any doubt on the outcome. The suspense-setpieces are entertaining to watch, and the ways in which they infiltrate the places they need to be is pure funstuff.<br /><br />The villain is a bit deranged and his motivations/employers remain something of a mystery. Which i find rather annoying. He becomes too delusional and ignorant to seem like much of a threat. The organization to which he belongs remains completely invisible so that the movie can focus on the personal relationship between Redford and Kingsley. I would've preferred it if the movie was more focused on structures than individuals, but that is generally not what these kinds of thrillers are there for.<br /><br />All in all i had fun, and that is what counts.
1432794426|5.0|I LOVE This book Defending A King  His Life & Legacy. Karen Moriaty has done an awesome job.When I started reading it I couldnt put it down. It kept my attention. Its very interesting. This book is the best that I have read.Its a wonderful book . Thank You Karen for caring about Michael and writing this book about him. Thank You for being honest ALL FOR LOVE!!! GOD BLESS YOU (IVA)
B008UX2UIO|2.0|I had to read this for a book club. If I were reading it for &#34;fun,&#34; I would have quit after the first chapter.  It's an egotistic justification for someone who's clearly mentally ill.  An absolute waste of time. I gave it two points because somebody obviously likes it and would consider me to just be &#34;missing the point.&#34;

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is the episode that was banned on NBC. I really don't know why, but that is why I purchased it.
B003R1B9MW|4.0|A movie with a purpose.  Inspiring to young and old.  I would recommend it.  Even though I am not a golfer I enjoyed it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game, do not have any regrets getting this app. I would suggest that you buy this game, very fun.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Given most apps cost a buck with all the terrific games, puzzles, movies, graphics and a very engrossing story  this app's well worth $5.  This is definitely the Cadillac of hidden game apps. Thanks G5!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I stand by that statement! Ozzy and the boys turned back the clock on this one and opened up a bottle of 1969! I went in to this with lukewarm expectations but had to buy it after reading review after review of five stars saying that this measure to the classics. It does!! Ozzy's voice is solid and not overproduced as has been the case for many years. Rick Rubin has to be commended for this. I would give Ozzy an A plus rating on this record and that is saying something. Tony Iommi is a tour de force guitar legend here from start to finish! Awesome riffs galore with some blazing solo's thrown in for good measure. Geezer is equally incredible as always and Brad Wilk does a fine job subbing for Bill Ward. No complaints there although obviously Bill Ward does bring something to the table.<br /><br />Here is a song by song rating for those that are interested: (ten point scale)<br /><br />End of the Beginning- 11 -this song is a staggering 8 minute bone crushing epic. Only one listen is needed and then you can pick your jaw up off the floor!<br />God is Dead- 9.5-  that's right! Another 8 minute epic with incredible tempo changes and typical top notch lyrics<br />Loner-10 - one of my personal favorites just for the immense riff alone but the whole song is a masterpiece.<br />Zeitgeist- 10- Planet Caravan part two and every bit of effective while being totally original. Amazing song made me wish there was at least one more slow song on the album.<br />Age of Reason- 9.5- great song with a solid Tony inspired guitar ending<br />Live Forever- 8- solid track rocking throughout but not quite up to the brilliance of the first five.<br />Damaged Soul- 11- another kick a$$ 10 from start to finish. wow...just wow. This maybe the best song on the CD.<br />Dear Father- 9- great way to end it here with a special and truly INCREDIBLE ending.  Won't spoil it because you have to hear it for yourself! Wow, ties it all together nicely if it is indeed the end!<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br/>Methademic- 9- the fastest track yet with great lyrics and riff master doing his thing.<br />Peace of Mind- 8.5- solid track<br />Paraih- 9.5- Great, great song. Right now this is my favorite of the bonus tracks<br />Naïvete in Black- 8 - uptempo song here, sounds a little more like solo Ozzy material<br /><br />To sum it up, I don't really see how anyone can rate this less than 4 or 5 stars but it's definitely a five for me and I say that judging this work on it's own against anything else that is out there today! I really truly mean that! Other people seemed to suggest that they rated higher because of there age and expectations. I say BS to that. This is a five star record that does stand right next to the all time greats. I put it below the first six but overall probably better than NEver Say Die (which I absolutely LOVE) and Technical Ecstasy which is still solid. This is Classic Sabbath with the same top notch musicianship and mind boggling tempo changes that made them great. It stands as a crowning achievement for one of the greatest bands of all time! Let's hope they have one more in them!!!!!!
B004ZISVWC|4.0|Well...maybe not that important or really a documentary...<br />It is fun though.  And very Norwegian.  But Norwegians have a good sense of dry and somewhat icy humor.<br />And it's nice there are trolls in Norway to accompany the humor.<br />I feel for the documentarians, but their loss provided us with a fine film.<br /><br />Thank you.  I'll watch your hard work again.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is classic Sabbath and possibly Ozzy at his absolutely pinnacle of singing. Truly remarkable stuff here! my personal favorite song is Megalomania followed by Symptom of the Universe and the Writ. The whole thing cranks from start to finish. A must for any true Sabbath fan!
B000NDMRCS|2.0|The movie didn't make much sense at all.  Very strange sub-plots and the overall message seemed lost due to the ridiculousness of the main setting.<br /><br />Seems like you could have made a ton of decent-to-mediocre films for the same price as this bewildering, special fx-ridden extravaganza.<br /><br />Not sure what the point of watching this film more than once would be.  Self-loathing perhaps?
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I LOVE this movie, Jason Statham is so good in this. I am not much into action movies but I love watching this over and over. Great movie to add to your collection.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked the way he interwove the different characters. The book was well written. As always with Hosseini's books, it was interesting to read about the afgan culture from his prospective.

1421527618|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is a very quick read, but it keeps the action going well and is an interesting idea.  I have hints of having heard it all before however.  I am glad to have read it before the movie comes out
B002ZG999U|5.0|I wasn't sure about getting this movie due to the actors, however I love Jason Statham and Bruce Willis (however Bruce Willis was barley in it)  so I decided to buy it and I am so glad I did, it is a awesome movie. the story line is very good and the slap stick they added to the movie is great. Great movie to add to your collection

B000FC146C|5.0|I'm ashamed to say, I saw the mini series before reading the book (by accident only!) but the book was incredible!  So many stories, so intertwined and written so beautifully.
B005LAII4E|2.0|The movie is basically about GI Joes and Ninjas.<br /><br />There are only a couple of interesting action scenes. For example, the sword fighting scenes on  the mountain cliff covered with snow. Most of the time, the sword fighting is repetitive for people who have seen a lot of Chinese kung fu films.<br /><br />It's predictable from the beginning till the end. There's only one surprise regarding the bugs that can...<br /><br />The acting is not engaging.<br /><br />Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Absolutely Great Movie, I do not understand how anyone could honestly give this movie less than a three star review.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play. Finished all the levels in one sitting. Needs more level... quick! Levels are challenging but not so hard as to need to search for cheats.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's addictive . so set a timer when you start to play ... and get ready for your face to hurt from laughing and smiling!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show and great cast. Highly addicting. Here I am supposed to be studying for the mcat and all I want to do is put on another episode.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked playing this.  Great fun and not too easy or too hard.  Hope to see more from this developer.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|I really sympathize with those reviewers who said this was the best movie they had ever seen, because it has a lot of exceptional things to say for itself. My problem was that it was unclear what was really important. But first, the good things.<br /><br />The recreation, however much it may have been based on speculation (almost all of the ancient city is under water), the recreation of the city of Alexandria draws you in, with a level of detail I have not seen since the city of Minas Tirith in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" You can almost feed the grit and the heat of the fires and the decay of old buildings. Even if most of it is done with blue screen and CGI, it must have kept lots of effects artists up for long hours.<br /><br />The historical story (much of which I checked after watching the movie) is more accurate than one may have presumed. All the principal characters, such as Hypatia, Cyril, and Orestes are real, mentioned in the Church History of Socrates Scholasticus. In fact, even the events of the last 20 minutes are described in that history. The further one goes back in history, the more speculative the story becomes. There is a later history which accuses Hypatia of using pagan wiles with music and other devious methods. The movie may use what sound like facts from both, but the tone is from the more moderate Socrates.<br /><br />Aside from Rachel Weisz, none of the actors are well known, except that the French character actor, Michael Lonsdale who has a familiar face from dozens of appearances (the Abbot in \\"The Name of the Rose\\"). All actors, both adult and adolescent versions of the characters, do well. There is nothing to fault there.<br /><br />I hope that people who see the movie realize this is real history (at least there is about two paragraphs of real history on which the story is based.)<br /><br />What might be hard to discern is \\"What was the point?\\" The title, \\"Agora\\", a Greek word for what we might call a mini-mall, has nothing to do with the story, except that a lot of action takes place in the streets of Alexandria. Of the three factions, early on, the pagans, then the Jews and the Christians, it is hard to identify any one as the villain, although it seemed the writer / director seemed to be a bit hard on the Christians and bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Why, for example, were the pagans in white, the Jews in brown, and the Christians in black?<br /><br />As I sat through the movie, I could not help thinking that all this exposition must be leading somewhere. The somewhere doesn't really arrive until the last 20 minutes of the movie. The ideas, the atmosphere, the action all was done well to very well, but nothing seemed to move the story along.tory, except that a lot of action takes place in the streets of Alexandria.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic looking watch.  Just look at the pictures.  What you can't see from the pictures is how cool the hands move as you stop and reset the stopwatch(this is my first chronograph).  The way the hour and minute hands glow slightly in the dark also is attractive.  My one little annoyance is the 'T' logo on the bracket clasp.  It is much more obvious in real life than in the sample picture and I think it is too much branding like a logo on a polo shirt.  But I don't have to look at it while checking the time - then I just notice how amazing my watch looks.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. This novel kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Every time I thought I had one of the main characters figured out, a new (and believable) surprise awaited. No formula writing here -- this is character driving suspense writing at its best. I get lost in these characters the way I do in Stephen King's, though this story is quite different from one of his. The characterization is as strong, though. Love this book and can't recommend it highly enough. Read it before it becomes a movie.

They could have remodeled it and &#34;Flipped&#34; it back to Mexico.
1451627297|5.0|This is Stephen King at his best, which is a relief after the disappointing \\"Under the Dome.\\"<br /><br />The novel deals with the perils of time travel, and the consequences of interfering in history. The protagonist, Jake Epping, is given the opportunity to prevent the Kennedy assassination, but there is a catch: the portal's entry point is fixed in 1958, which means Jake has a lot of time to fill. He does this by creating two lives for himself: one in Dallas-Fort Worth to keep an eye on Lee Harvey Oswald, and another as a high school English teacher in Jodie, Texas. Needless to say, this has its consequences as well, not the least of which is falling in love with a woman who'll be around 80 years old in 2011. And what about those other lives?<br /><br />Besides being a first-rate thriller, \\"11/22/63\\" is also a meditation on meddling where you don't belong and the reach of unintended consequences. Ordinarily, I would discuss some of the flaws, but for this book I honestly can't think of one. I only hope King is careful about writers and directors when it comes time to make the film. (Personally, I vote for Frank Darabont.)<br /><br />Don't let its 850 pages daunt you. You'll turn them all, and quickly.

I want to know what the weather is and is likely to be, I do not want to try and decipher what the pages say because someone has decided to add picture backdrops that are not compatible with the font color.  Straighten this out and I won't care how you display info.  I just want to be able to read it.

B005LAII4E|2.0|There is amazing action scenes and very good story and I will say this at start.<br />There are fighting scenes and it is just so fake that none of the bullets hit the characters and its the same thing over and over again. I almost was going to stop watching this movie and just quit. This movie was a fail. And it does not deserve 4 or 5 stars.
B004N6369Y|5.0|All I can say, is it was one of Danielle Steel's best.  Loved the characters & how I was drawn in from the very beginning.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Much better than most of the other games out there.  More than worth the price.  Not too easy to solve.  This game is definitely up to G5 standards. Excellent graphics.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Okay, so I must admit that I didn't go into watching this movie with high expectations.  I'm in my late twenties and usually listen to Katy Perry as a guilty pleasure or for workouts.  I wouldn't say I was a die hard fan or anything close to that, BUT this was one of the best artist on the road documentaries I've seen.  It left me a bit emotional, really liking her, and overall inspired.  Other than the part where her ex decides to dump her during tour it was a happy movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very interesting and challenging.  I would do another any time.  It kept you inquisitive about what was the next challenge and how quickly you could solve it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A delightful, moving story that reminds us that no matter how broken we are there are people that will love, support, and encourage us if only we allow them to do so.

B002PNER9U|5.0|Very entertaining. Great music. True to Broadway version. I watch it over and over. Definitely worth watching.  I love it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really addicting game, stupid addictive. I haven't stopped playing the game since I first downloaded it. Haven't found really any major flaws with the game either.
B005544V6A|5.0|Amazing show with characters that have so many layers to them you believe that they are actually real people. The dynamic btw Harvey and Mike, Harvey and Donna, Harvey and Jessica and Mike and Rebecca just keeps you wanting more...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun game to play - easy for all ages. Free and almost no ads. Very addicting - good for rainy days.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it. After seeing the movie, they just had to have the game. It's just what they excepted and love it
034553798X|5.0|It's easy to get lost in it. It was recommended by a friend, as I am designing some botanical chocolates. I love this whole new idea of the language of flowers and how that might play a role in my chocolates.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Good writing, fine acting make this drama a hit. This an adult themed show, but watch the pilot episode if you like that one then you'll love the show!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love every tape the Piano Guys put out.  This one is great, but lacks some of the punch of number one.  I want a DVD of the Red Rocks concert!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Reads and displays PDF files very quickly without problems. Widely used and should be a standard application in your toolkit.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Liked all three seasons. It is convenient to watch on Amazon. It is best  to watch in order for full understanding.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|Rio was very entertaining for both young and old. It also had a moral to the story that teaches children something good wirhout them even knowing it...you can use it to talk about the different things that happened with them.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|This is really a great series.  The only criticism I would have, is that they could eliminate the pornography that is interlaced through a number of episodes.  That's the only reason I wouldn't give it five stars - it's just unnecessary.
0691126658|5.0|Lovely book with great pictures. I love birds and am very interested in going to Africa.  I hope too see most of these birds in this book.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This book consists of a reporter visiting witnesses and getting their first hand experiences. This would be ok if only after you got interested in what they were saying it didn't abruptly end and move to the next person's experience. There are no chapters and it never really came to a conclusion.
0756697875|5.0|My grand-son loves Batman and is always playing that character. He loves reading this book and finding out facts about his favorite action charcter.
0307341577|5.0|I'm joining the throngs who loved this book. Great pacing, great voices, edge-of-seat but literary and with feeling. Plus it gives just enough that the reader, if paying close attention, can figure things out because there is a terrible (as in scary but true) logic to it all.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Brilliantly cast, acted and directed.<br />It has been one of my favorite American classic novels since I first read it half a century ago.  Upon rereading it last year and then recently seeing the new film version ,this fascination has continued to enchant and sadden me.  The films are different but equal in capturing F. Scott Fitzgerald's story .  My plan is to watch each version at least once a year in tandem.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have a son who is bipolar so this book was great for me in that respect  I have not seen the movie.  I thought it was well written and I could relate to the mother who struggled to keep her son at home, and how difficult that was at times.  A must read for anyone who is directly involved with a family member who has a mental disorder.
B000083E79|3.0|i thank the farewell tour was her best sound of al her songs but I have this one to<br /><br />cher is the best
B00846REIS|4.0|Very hard to put down. Enjoyed the story line. Hope the next two are just as compelling. I have to say Gideon Cross is more appealing with his gentle side, when compared to the first Fifty shades look at Christian Gray.
