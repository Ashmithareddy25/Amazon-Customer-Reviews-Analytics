B00GJB9H8U|2|Disappointing. Unlined and the seams are irritating.  They don't work very well on my iPad touch screen.
B00JC10QVQ|5|They look great and fit great... she loves em, I am soooo turned on when she wears em, Oh man, so nice
B00NF9M7TA|4|Super adorable! But sooo small, I ordered a size 5 for my 3.5 year old, and only got to put it on her twice. It was so cute though that I ordered another in size 6
B007PESS5S|5|When is the last time that new underwear put a big smile on the face of your child?<br />Good quality, good price, item arrived on time, and it is something that will actually get used more than once, what more is there to say
B005F28HBM|3|These pants are great, except for one basic flaw- the cargo pockets are located too far forwards on the leg.  Instead of being on the sides of the thigh, the pockets are low and towards the front- if you were to actually put your cell phone in the suggested pocket, you run the risk of kneeling on it.  Any item in the main pockets can shift forward and rub against the kneecap... a strange oversight on Carhartt's part.  I'm wearing my pants high, belted at the waist, too.<br />As a result, these pants are not nearly as useful for working in as they might be.  For casual wear, they're nice.  The fabric seems tough, but not as course and stiff as the usual Cahartt cotton duck.
B00UF80R6O|5|perfect
B00JX7NBKW|1|I'm 5'1 about 127lbs a medium was too small and my boobs looked funny. Stuck in drawer probably never wear..lame
B009FU84WM|5|This baby tee is absolutely adorable!  I am still pregnant, so I can't exactly &#34;review&#34; how well my child likes is, but my husband (the one that is the HUGE Steelers fan) absolutely LOVES it and can't wait to put our daughter in the tee when she's big enough.  :)
B005FO0Y7U|5|Beautiful decoration.
B005CI3EN0|5|MY WIFE LOVES IT !
B009AV1CHA|5|Shipping was fine product was fine. Cheaper material then everyday bras but def usable for those times when your not leaving the house and its after 8 pm
B005PVUJQY|5|I was concerned it might not be large enough, as I am a 44L suit jacket. I have never ordered an on line item or bought an item in a store that is this incredible.  This truly looks like and has the workmanship of a MUCH more expensive jacket.  The quality is amazing!!!! The leather is supple and soft and there are NO wrinkles at all---it was packed with great care. I LOVE it!  Thanks Vintage Leather--I will most definately order from you again!
B00EOYNSNY|5|She loved the shirt!!!
B007G0UQ60|5|Very happy with it, she looks and it fits perfectly.
B00AE0FX08|5|nice prodect
B00OPQ5316|5|This belt is superb for dress wear.
B00G31KAKU|5|Very nice shirt for the price. Fits perfectly.
B001RTIDKM|5|Cute, comfy, supportive.
B00AYZCX7Y|5|I haven't worn nylons for so many years, I forgot how hard they are to put on. But they fit the same as they always did. Needed to wear for my daughters wedding. Good price. Still glad they make Sheer Energy. Very good all over control. Always need the reinforced toe.
B00422MCVM|5|Excellent..!
B00FDND8D0|2|I read the other reviews and bought a 5x. I&#34;m 5'2&#34; about 150 and this sweatshirt is a tent on me.
B005DMGI7E|5|Very happy with this pair of pants.  Extremely comfortable, but durable enough for sports activities or in the gym.  Definitely will be purchasing more in the future!
B00H27MXIG|5|Finding a good vegan belt is difficult, but finding one that is also stylish is a feat of strength on its own. I am so happy with this belt that I show it off all the time to my friends if they haven't seen it. It is durable, the loop doesn't wear out the material so it looks new and it has a quality feel. Make sure you go a size or two up as I had to order it a few times to get it just right. Use a measuring tape and you'll save yourself some trouble.
B00VJRHLAK|5|Loved the hat. Looks awesome too
B00L64UWKW|5|Fit great and go it just in time for the dance
B00I1FNWTC|5|Love!
B006ZSUJPW|5|Excelente producto!
B00K1B2N6C|5|Very thing got was super.
B0007U9D6U|5|Excellent
B00AMEZI24|2|The tees are different color and the turtles are not the ones on the picture. The product delivered is not what we ordered.
B00JMXH978|5|Love these jeans, and a great price on Amazon as opposed to in stores.<br /><br />There perfect around my waist. No more tugging up my pants all the time or having gross cupcakes from low-rise jeans.<br /><br />They look so cute too, definately fashionable. I'm in my twenties, and regardless of age, low-rise jeans really aren't flattering on most people. These make me feel good, they're comfortable. Ordered a size 4, quick shipping. Easy to dress up or down. Definately recomend for every lady who want to look good in jeans and be comfortable too!!! (:
B00I1AUT7U|5|I'm completely in love with these shoes for my baby girl. She didn't fit into it until she was 7 weeks old.
B006SGQK04|5|Never fails me.  Worn this brand and style for decades...
B00OJH2QWA|5|I Need to said: This jumpsuit is more than I expected. Look so fancy & trendy. If U see the chart & take the right measures: Fit perfectly. Hug your curves but at the same time the denim is relax. Everybody love my overall.
B00QNYB04W|5|This is my first time buying a corset and waist training. I found this corset very cheap and the material is just prefect. Gives my body curves and have no problems putting it on and taking it off. I'm a size Large, therefore I order an XL, fits great to my body. If you have any question, I'll gladly replied.
B001ORJE96|5|Fantastic jacket.  Very comfortable stylish, and performs well in the heaviest of downpours. Something you should note though, it IS designed to be worn in layers.  Maybe even just a light sweater.<br /><br />It was fairly warm without a sweater but the fit a little cumbersome, and it doesn't allow your skin to breathe well as it is the definition of waterproof (And waterproof of course is from the inside as well as outside). This means your skin could be warm to cold and clammy without that second layer, just take my advice and wear one with this coat.<br /><br />The hood also detaches, and there are nice big pockets to put your junk in.
B006HFJA12|5|very happy with the product
B00H9H8BU8|5|After experiencing the high quality is Royce leather in my own money clip wallet, it was a no brainer to buy a second Royce wallet for my best friends upcoming bday. As someone who doesn't like his style imitated, I bought this slightly different version for him. Nonetheless this is a great wallet- even slimmer than mine- which is very important for younger guys with no need for all the credit card slots and unnecessary compartments/pockets. There's a clever outside cash pocket on this wallet as well if you need more room.
B00UAKV5LI|5|it looks great on my daughter
B0085BEPM0|4|this is the best compression leggings and I have a few different brands.<br />it is a true compression. keeps me cool during workouts. I gave it 4 stars cause of the waist band.. too narrow and folds.<br />It should be wider like their regular sub dual legging.
B000RZLVEW|5|I love this wallett. I added my checkbook and additional ID card holder. Both fit perfectly. I will buy this item again.
B006RJN7OO|3|I bought these pants around when I was 20 weeks pregnant. So much better than trying to squeeze into my old pre-pregnancy scrub pants!  However something happened. As my burgeoning belly got bigger, these got seriously uncomfortable. I placed them under my belly, and it was even worse when I would sit down.  I'd pull them up over my belly and the pressure from the elastic was unbearable.  I wish they would make the elastic band for the belly portion like maternity leggings where it is very thin and stretchy.  The band on these pants are too thick and can only stretch so much before you realize there isn't that much give once you hit your third trimester and your belly really takes off in growing.  My job requires a lot of sitting and leaning forward when examining patients and working and the pressure on my abdomen (with the pants pulled up above or below belly) was horrible.  In addition, the baby would move like crazy due to the pressure pressing up on me.  I would buy these late in first trimester and second trimester but toss it to the side when you feel too much pressure on your belly.
B00FUHWK9C|3|Very, very thin material.  I have a large behind and this product barely covered and reached waist.  Haven't washed yet so may be unwearable post washing.
B000RN272Y|4|Bra arrived on time and in good condition. It is very supportive, but a little to small. I normally wear a 32F to a 32G, but the cup of the 32G I ordered was slightly to small.
B00C7AY3V8|5|I'm a small person and they fit just right. Of course, you can adjust it to other sizes. It looks great on.<br />Not sure about the strength, though. I'll have to use it more than a couple of times, but so far so good.
B00F3DWIUE|5|I ordered these in a size 5 for my 4.5 year old. I thought they would be too big, but figured he would grow into them. Maybe kids don't grow as much between 4 and 8, but these fit him perfectly. Happy. Wish they had more available in winter/snow themes.
B00GBDTG9Q|5|I just received this scarf and I absolutely love it! it does feel like cashmere- so very soft. It is nice and long so you can wear it different ways. It is a thin material, which I happen to like even in the Northeast winters. I basically wear it with my pea coat to work, as I have to be a little dressed up in my job traveling to various offices throughout the day. This is not a scarf for going skiing or sleigh riding, etc. But it is perfect for basic warmth, The colors are vibrant as shown in the picture as well. I definitely recommend it.
B00AAQ3ZQ0|5|i ordered 3 they were long and fit perfect to my expectantions
B00553XMRK|5|The design of this bra is well thought out and really delivers.  I have many different brands and this is my favorite.  The additional layer (which is adjustable) over the breast is essential to keeping the girls in place. The wide shoulder straps are padded, so not to dig in on the top of the shoulder and a wide 4 hook back provides plenty of support.
B0051U186E|4|Tight for me. I needed to order diabetic socks, not a larger sizy. My bad!
B000BRL0LU|5|Bought, preemptively for a Life Aquatic costume come this Halloween.  It's nice and cozy and fits great. Can't wait till October!
B003YL3VLM|3|Very nice, soft material.  It was difficult to find a peacoat that wasn't wool, as I am allergic.  But I have a large chest and the double breasted style of the coat didn't work, so it will be returned.  Too bad, it was very cute.
B00CE3KR18|4|This is a solid shirt for wearing on a beach during a vacation.  Don't be the dope that wears this shirt to a family dinner, that sucks.
B00DZUHXK2|5|Super cute and we'll made
B00FGPJ2LC|4|real, but no discount
B001FXHB12|2|Ok... before I start bashing this product, I must say... I should have known for the price that it was going to be crap. But seriously? This wig is crap. I bought it to wear this past Halloween, and ended up putting it straight in the trash (I didn't have the energy to even return it for a refund... I was so frustrated it literally went straight in the trash). The bangs were ridiculously uneven, and the fibers of hair, if you can call it that, fell out as soon as I ran my fingers through it. The wig arrived in a bag in which it was crumbled into... I mean come on it could have at least been laid flat. I guess the only positive note I can write is that at least it wasn't itchy... for the five minutes I had it on.
B002P5A0WG|5|I've had kidney stones since I was 12. Had lithotripsy in middle school. I like this shirt.. Or at least in appearance, since I don't need any tshirts right now.
B008VPS5ZS|5|These fit very good and it feels like silk.  Very comfy and perfect for summer wear.  I bought a second pair
B005GYGF54|4|Ordered a size medium. Fits well when walking around the house, but after wearing to Zumba class, the waist band area kept on slipping down and piling at my private area was embarrassing. Order a size down. Material was comfortable, but it shows the sweat stain. It was also not that flattering if you have fleshy thighs like me. My thighs look huge in it. I kept it to wear around the house. I advise you to purchase the black version, I ordered one in black and small size and it was good in the fitting.
B00G51R8TY|5|STRAIGHT up sexy. But i wouldnt buy this if your a woman or ya lady doesnt have big boobs. other than that the only complaint is it fit a lil too big.
B001TJ8AS0|2|Ugly with a flimsy brim flapping down over my eyes... Don't run or bike with this or you might be in danger. I keep it on my &#34;Don't buy this again&#34; trunk.
B0057XDBC4|5|I have 2 other pairs the same size and they are very comfortable. I wear them every day even when im not working. will buy more in the future
B00KFZ4JBG|4|This is a good shirt.  It fits correctly and is good quality.
B00BWU0322|5|As expedited
B00A4LCHWO|5|I have long hair, so the SOA logo on the back is hidden... still, I've been surprised how many people recognize the SAMCRO logo and want to talk about the show.  It always starts: &#34;Can you believe they killed off Opie!?&#34;
B00188DQHC|5|Matched my multicam uniform perfectly, fit me perfectly and well priced arrived ahead of time. Tobad I changed uniforms now ill have to pay 100 for a boonie corresponding my new camo
B000KEL6BI|5|got these for standing around in the cold winter camping and ice fishing. and for that they are awesome. any moving around and you will get too hot quick.
B00A9SJWMA|5|I am 5'9, 145lbs with average bust size. I ordered a Large because I was worried about the length of the top but should have ordered a medium. It is slightly big in the chest area for me but still can be worn without the strap to hold it up even when it's wet.<br />The material is so soft and doesn't make me feel like I am wearing a t'shirt when I get in the water.  It's very well made and I am sure it will last a long time.
B00N1HAAQI|3|Thin. U get what u pay for
B0009MZVMG|5|Worked so well I ordered 6 more pairs.
B0088IKEES|4|I have many leveret pj sets and I have been very happy about the quality for the price. I did want to share that there is quite a bit of pink in these PJs so I would choose them for a girl. If you are trying to decide between this set and another of Leverets PJs for your boy you might want to pick a different set.
B009YG815M|4|This is a very small wallet that can fit in your front pocket.  This wallet allows me to sit without putting a dent in my keester, and it discourages clutter.  I like the quality of the wallet itself.  I can live without the RFID sleeve, but it's there if you want to use it.  There are 3 card pockets on one side and a nice ID/Driver's License pocket on the other.  The zippered enclosure will hold a few bucks.  This is all I need and would definitely purchase again if the need arose.
B005N12A4K|4|Too big. didnt wear.
B011849WTQ|1|The only thing I liked about it was the design on front. It is sized very small and the quality of the material was very cheap.
B00GFMTH38|5|I absolutely love this dress. It has been perfect for the cooler spring days with the long sleeves. The fabric is so soft and feels great. This is not a form fitting dress but I wasn't expecting it to be. Someone said I looked like Pebbles from The Flinstones, but I am ok with that. This dress goes great with heels or flats. Be careful if it is a windy day!!!
B008JY12C4|2|The pants themselves are incredibly comfortable and fit great. The material is soft and feels high quality.<br /><br />However, after wearing the pants once, one of the metal rivets on the cargo pockets has already fallen out; leaving a frilly, unsightly hole in the front of the pants.<br /><br />As comfortable and nice as the pants are, I can't wear them again.
B00NJ5T4KK|5|Good quality!
B00UROXNXU|5|My son loved the suit!  It was very exquisite and only required hemming of the trousers!  Excellent value!  He looked stunnng fr Senior Prom 2015!
B00551PXZQ|5|I have tried so many bras over the 40-some years I've been wearing them, and it's really hard to find one that is comfortable, attractive, and gives sufficient support to the girls. (Gravity is not my friend.) This is the first and only no-wire bra I have ever tried that provided the lift, separation, and smoothness without 50's pointiness. Not only that, but it feels like a dream and continues all day long. I only wish it were available in more colors in my size. (It's only in white and nude.) Time will tell how long it lasts, but at this price, I'll be ordering several more. Love it, love it, love it!
B00E4XQ7DS|5|Good Value
B00593MI58|4|I really like this product.  The fit is great and the quality is awesome. I will go back and purchase another pair.
B00VV5GOOE|3|The cover up fit fine except it did not fully wrap around me, it just hung off me. The colors are pretty, and the design turned out great.
B00KZMDLFY|3|Looks like a great jacket but way too small.  I am sending back. the 3XLT was significantly smaller that an XL  jacket .  I ordered up because of the reviews.  Not a good size.  looks like a nice lightweight jacket but going back.
B009XDW6X4|5|Hard to remove. Think it might break. Anxious to see how long it lasts.
B00EXOO5TQ|1|The sizing is totally off. Their extra-large is really small. I was able to return this item, But it would have cost me more to send it back to China then to keep it. That is absolutely ridiculous Amazon.
B00L9WZ4CW|5|Great!
B007LHUULY|3|The legs don't roll up -  thank God - but it  fits all the way up under  the bra which I find very uncomfortable and hot.  They also didn't seem to flatten the Buddha belly as much as I wanted.<br />The search continues.
B00NICNVLC|5|Awesome better than I expected arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date
B00F7YFM6G|5|Got this for both of my parents and they loved it! Fits well!
B00FLZ94YM|5|Quality Shirt
B004R8Y6A6|3|Costume quality!  Very skimpy use of crinoline.  Had to add more crinoline to make it useful.  Think Halloween store at the mall.  If that is what you are looking for, this is your slip.
B008WYDR6U|4|Kind small but the fit and style are great still was able to wear no problem.
B0009VERJ0|5|Good value and, though subjective, the fit is good for me. I've always been happy with RoadRunner products and customer service. They really seem to care about their customers. I wear these under my running tights. I was looking for something supportive but a bit more minimalistic than the [[ASIN:B0038A1AEY Boxerjock's by Under Armour]] that I was wearing. They fit the bill and I'm now thinking of getting another 3 pack!
B006IL5MN0|5|Is from a very good quality. I really enjoy it ^^ I wanted the ahark one but this is pretty cool.
B000XUFZ3O|1|I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it. The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is. In addition to that the scarf had creases all over, most likely from already having been returned and repackaged. I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week.
B00JH4E29A|5|Loved!! My daughter looked so cute in it! I recommend!
B00JM93HR8|5|i love it
B00NNA38F8|3|The clincher is very pretty and seems to be made of quality materials. Shoulder straps are a bit narrow. The boning crinkled up in the back during wear, which made for odd & uncomfortable bulges on my back/waist. Then one strip of boning fell out entirely, which made it more comfortable, however now the bottom of the back side rolls up at the waist, whereas it didn't before. Decent compression at 3 different choices for tightness using the hook & eye closures, but a US size L still needs to get an XXL by their sizing, so it does run about 2 sizes small by US standards. Adjust accordingly when ordering.
B00KXFA5OI|5|It's a very cool leash and actually if something happens Wolfgang will give you 50% off through their website.
B0009MZUU4|2|Be careful in ordering these socks.  I've always thought Thorlo is the king of quality but thee socks slip off my heel.  I won't be reordering.
B003981ZOU|5|Even more beautiful in person. Loved this as a baptism dress for my 9 month old.
B008596OGM|5|This dress is amazing. It looks very similar to how it does in the picture and it is great on. The material is stretchy. Beware tall people! It is a very short dress. I am 5'5\\" and it covers me, but it may be a little too short for many. I love the golden design on the sides. One of Allegra's better dresses.
B00NSE4SYE|5|Love❤❤
B00OV22VJG|4|The design is awesome but it was smaller then I thought it was gonna be. Either I'm fatter or it runs small.
B0041BR2NW|3|It added just the right touch to the costume!  There was some adjustment to the size, but it still worked.
B00IA9UTOA|5|good quality...<br />my husband love it!!
B00LUZJ1GI|4|Very good Thanks
B00AOMYD34|5|THEY SHIPPEY REALLY FAST AND I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I GOT THEM. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE FIT BUT I FOLLOWED THE FIT CHART AND THEY WERE PERFECT! THEY ARE DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE PAIR NOW, CONSIDERING BUYING MORE. DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THEM, THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT. THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE INSIDE OF THE POCKET IS WHITE AND I WOULD PREFER THEM TO BE BLACK AS WELL, BUT I OVERLOOK THIS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT FIT!
B004BR1TIU|1|These are not real Levis. I have many pairs of Levis jeans, and they are made from good, strong material. This pair is very thin material, and is falling apart after only a month of wear. They also run large for Levis. Not a good buy. Don't waste your money.
B008BFOQUQ|5|Purchased for one of my granddaughters for christmas, she loved them.<br />Quality, great!<br />Washable!<br />She like the mitten concept and still can have her fingures free for her remotes!<br /><br />Would buy another pair for myself!
B00I1AVYLA|1|This backpack has a very strong ink smell. I washed it a few times it still smells like rubber.  Very disappointed and I can not return it now.
B00KLDBRRQ|4|This dress is a very nice fitted dress, the color is a little brighter but it's still very nice dress
B000SSRYCQ|4|This is a really good costume for Halloween! Do not buy this if you want the clothing though, like pants, gloves, the wig, and shirt, you won't be getting any of that with this. But you do get a cape, 6 daggers, a belt, hat and a mask. The mask disappointed me a little because is was plastic and not hard, long lasting and rubbery like other masks you may find at stores or something. But still great to wear, just keep it in good condition if you plan on wearing it more than once.
B00A2I6I0Q|2|I should have heeded the warnings of previous buyers. I have small hands and even so, the fingers on these gloves were way too short for me. Sad.
B00N2706MA|3|I lovrd the color and the weight of the material. However, this item did not fit as expected. On the model, the asymmetrical cut looks long. However, on my 5'3&#34; frame, the points barely went past my waist. It was literally just a rectangle of fabric wih a seam up one side and a hole for your head. I returned this product.
B001A6BVHE|5|totally cool!
B008R6TN5M|2|the sizes are wrong, it fits very bad, are too big, bad quality, very bad quality, they are already uggly.
B00BHNUMWK|5|My son loves Ninjago, and as a red head, he has very fair skin that burns easily.  This rash guard fits great, and protects his shoulders, back and upper arms from the sun.  Perfect for long days at the pool, or beach.
B00JSK0LCA|5|We love our shirts. They are a little big because i read the reviews and got a size up thinking they would run to small but overall we love them! We ordered a mens xl and a womens L. WE probaly could have went with our original sizes (Womens Medium, Mens L.) The material is kind of strecthy.
B002959F7I|5|Good product good fit
B00EQ8WOBU|5|diesel its a great product
B008YIFYN8|3|i love the style... but the size is off. i usually wear a medium.. that was too small.. sent it back and got a large.. and that was still too small.. however, the sender was wonderful and very compliant so that was great!.. I kept it but only for my Fiance's eyes to see!
B00EFQKKUK|5|I love the crochet trend and wanted a pair of shorts for summer concerts. I adore these. They fit perfectly and are a perfect length. I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs. I wear a 00-2 depending on the cut. I don't think they'd fit anyone much bigger.
B0036USVO8|5|Hanes t-shirts are a great value for the price, plus they're tagless for comfort.  They were new in the package as described and arrived super quickly. I recommend this seller and will purchase these again!
B00LVNVCVQ|2|I bought these because a friend of mine has the same ones and they match my skin tone and it seems impossible to get nylons that are deathly pale.<br />Extremely happy that I finally found my color, I was unpleasantly surprised upon wearing. The first 2 pairs of the 3 ripped the first day and all I do is SIT at my desk. I was very disappointed in the quality. I have several pairs of black nylons from target that I have had for over a year and no holes for 1/3 the price!
B00115BK8O|4|I love this brand, and usually spend a ton at the Mall when I need to buy one.  So I was so happy to find it on Amazon for about $10 cheeper.  For full coverage, this is one of the best bras so far that I wear confidently.  And they last for a while as long as you care for them well.  I think I've had mine for over a year.
B00KCGQUJW|4|I'm a size 14  I brought this dress in XL and I love it. The dressed surprised me on how cute it fit. Yes it is a little short but manageable .
B000NAZNIG|3|The Xlarge size was far too bog.  It's always hard to get the size right when ordering online.  But Beall's promptly refunded my $ when I sent them back, so that went very well.
B005J7JULO|4|Super thin, but for a summer, outdoor party in Texas, it did the deed, and I looked fantastic!
B00IAAUQXI|5|My son loved it...fit great!
B00FN36RLU|5|This Pashmina is beautiful in the navy - silky and soft and very nice color options ... The cost on these was shockingly low ...and they would make absolutely beautiful and appreciated gifts for CHEAP!
B00CZQJK4Y|5|Gorgeous dress. It is perfect for my daughters baptism. material is a little different than what I expected though. But very pretty
B003P2VQ4E|2|The material feels cheap, and there's not as much gel padding as appears in the picture.
B007THO2KQ|5|I own these crop cargos in several colors. I have bought both size zero and a size one..... both fit well and look good. I am 5' 2\\", 100lbs and the length is just right.
B00L1C0VPK|5|Absolutely wonderful. Such a good quality for such a small price. Definitely would buy again. I wore it the day I got it, and inline my other beanies, I couldn't feel the cold through it. So warm, and well made. 110% recommend for anyone who needs an excellent quality beanie for a low price. It also arrived only TWO days after I ordered it! :)
B00TO217AW|4|Cheap fabric
B004ARLLMK|4|For the price, these socks are pretty good.  They're soft and fit okay, although a little snug.  I wear a size 10 shoe.  Snug, but not too tight.  The socks have been washed twice so they've probably finished shrinking.  Good enough socks.  I'd buy them again.
B00EB13P7E|4|I had a little difficulty getting the right size after reading other peoples reviews. Others said the waist ran big....I disagree. I hold my weight in my stomach area. I ordered a 9 which is my regular size and I couldn't button them. I was discouraged and ordered a 13. LOL they were huge. I know have an 11. The waist is comfortable but the legs are a little loose(I do have slim legs). Overall they are a thin but comfortable fabric, nice stiching, Nice front pockets(womens pants pockets are often tiny), worth the money! And the return policy was very nice!
B00A3HEW9K|5|Nice pants!!!
B003M8H1JA|5|i just got my gloves the other day, i bought them from a department store because i needed them ASAP. I work outside for 7hrs a day in all types of weather. these gloves are heaven sent... they are sooo soft on the inside they even kept my hands warm the whole time, not once i needed to remove them. the grip on the palm of the gloves kept my cell phone and other objects secure while holding them. i was able to use my phone screen with no problems. i definitely  recommend these gloves!!!
B000GW69Y8|5|TOTALLY adorable! My son didn't get to go out for his first Halloween thanks to the weather but we have some great pictures to share and he enjoyed wearing it. Not at all pink or coral - it was red with an orange-y tummy - and looked great!
B001DD60PM|5|It is very beautiful and sexy. Quality is ok but not perfect. However, it is good enough for the price.
B00MSHQL5G|5|I LOVE THESE SOCKS!! THEY ARE BEATIUFUL BEAUITFULLY MADE! That was in caps before these socks are life they are very cushiony and fit tight but great. I have skinny legs and they fit like a glove. They kinda of look like men socks but all huf socks come like this. Great details! 5 HUNDRED STARS!!
B008TMQ2LW|5|Great fancy gloves, and the touch function works amazingly well, so I don't have to take my gloves off when it's snowing out to touch my smartphone's screen.
B000N8TGPO|3|This brand is undersized - this was like the second time I have had to return a purchase.  I felt good that I didn't have to pay to send it back.
B008LWS9IY|3|I bought 2 of these for my job. The material is thicker that I would have liked, so I would not recommend this for work in a hot kitchen. The collar is very thick, making it stubborn and difficult to stay in place. Also, the material around the buttons is very thick and heavy, causing the bottom of the button area to bulge out awkwardly from my chest. I bought one white and one black. Despite it being made of thick material the white one is kind of easy to see through, so I have to wear a flesh tone bra underneath. I'm not thrilled with my purchase but I guess it will do for now.
B002JFOU3W|5|Bow tie and waist cummerbund fit fine.  I love the color.  It will go well with my Red Parrot cover vest and the Black Tuxedo.
B00HY3MQAS|3|Could be better not good for lounging.
B005N3SN5I|2|Granted I have a larger then average baby, but not so much that this should be too little for her.  I bought this when my daughter was just 3.5 months, and it was way too tight on her!  the outfit is cute, but nothing special, I paid too much for what it was.  I gave it two stars for being exactly as described, I took away 2 stars because it fits too small, and another because it was just not as cute as I thought it would be.
B00FB6K86O|5|Arrived as expected and were just what I wanted.
B005IN7HQO|5|I thought twice before buying this swimsuit, but now I wouldn't dream going to the sea side without it. Except the fact that I get noticed every time I wear it, it doesn't leave any tan marks. Great piece!
B00UZV7F02|1|Purchase it for my baby sis in Carolina &she,s a big girl.she says it was beautiful but too small for her..even though it was an extra large.
B00JKGCEN6|2|doesnt look like it should on the sides and weird stockings came with it. not ones in picture
B0010KXA4W|5|I love these! They are warm comfortable and practical! They fit me very nicely wether I wear my hair down or in a pony tail. At the time of this review they have free shipping and you can't beat that!
B00HTUU0E0|5|The t shirt is the same as at the pictures. Bright color and good quality
B008EKMTIE|4|All cotton is comfortable but wrinkles, but OK if hung right out of the dryer.
B00SG5HGEY|2|This dress is stunning on and was a recent hit in my dress collection . I was askedd by several people where the dress came from.
B008GSAOGI|5|the jacket is great on wearing and size is great and the color is nice my son liked it alot and it gives him warm
B00CNBFFIG|4|liked it
B00DKLQXYS|5|The size is just what I expected. Fits nicely. Easy to put on / take off due to snaps on shoulder / neck and bottom. Colors have not bled at all when washing...and didn't shrink much either. Very nice.
B00JBL824K|5|Great cap. Got a few compliments. Really well made.
B00EV163KK|5|I love this. It's smooth and soft in the inside. Looks exactly as pictured. I'm pretty small and this fit me well considering it's a one size fits all kind of thing. Graphics are beautiful.
B00KS15RK4|3|I loved the feel of this very fine material as I was slipping on this smoother.  But, as I pulled it up, the sides ripped out or were already open, I am not sure.  I have the correct size and it was even on the larger size for me.<br /><br />I went ahead and put on the shape-wear and there were a few other things that I didn't love about it.  I am tall and the buttock part of the brief did not cover my rear correctly.  It was cut funny in the back....maybe to straight so that it would not tuck under but made a line across.  The straps were comfortable but the open/close feature in the crotch area was not at all comfortable for me either.  This product may need a rework for design.  Also, I would call this more of a light smoother not a shaper.
B007UUB91W|2|I ordered Navy Blue and received Black.  They were returned for another pair and they were also Black.  I had several friends check their color, just in case I have become color blind, and all agreed they were Black.  Better send the manufacturer a color chart.
B005MGG6AU|4|I bought this 12-18 month sleeper for my 5 month old baby boy who is a small giant. He's 20 lbs. and about 28\\"+ long and is outgrowing his 9 month sleepers from Carter's, Gerber, and Target brand (none of these brands make 12 month old zip sleepers). This sleeper shrunk at least 2\\" on a cold wash and low heat drying. This worked out OK because it fits him just perfectly right now but definitely is not a 12-18 month size. Others have complained that the sleeper runs slim fit and it does but my son doesn't mind it and I'm still able to zip him up pretty easily. I like the soft stretchy 100% cotton fabric and the stripe colors are very attractive. We haven't had any problems with the zipper or the snap. I bought 3 more of this Leveret brand after this one as I am happy with the product. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because the sizing is misleading and I feel they should preshrink the fabric prior to manufacture for the price of the sleeper.
B002FSY1MI|5|I so love this ankle bracelet. I have a habit of losing them evey summer. I am also a fan of hearts so this is a perfect fit.<br />Amazon hasn't disappointed me yet. :0)
B002C3WOG6|5|I wanted an easy costume for my little guy that wouldn't cause much fuss and this was great.  We paired it with a thermal tee and my kiddo just thought he was wearing overalls.  It was great and it is super cute.  Everyone complimented the little guy.  I would definitely recommend it for toddlers.  I think it runs true to size.
B005KSZHHI|5|Heavy, Thick and Tough leather!  This is nice looking and is not a piece of junk! This belt will last as long as you do!
B001PLMOUM|5|This hat is absolutely the cutest I have ever seen!!! I got it for my 17 year old and she loves it. I'm going to be buying one for myself!
B005CSOI2Q|4|I should have listened to the other reviewer when the mentioned to get a size smaller than what you normally wear. These are little to large but after the second round of wash they fit perfectly fine.
B00VDI6TJE|5|Costco sold out of these. I'm so glad Kirkland still sells them over Amazon. It is almost impossible to get full-grain leather belts these days. Most leather belts are bonded leather crap and come apart after moderate usage. Real full-grain leather doesn't peel, split, etc. Usually a full grain leather belt will easily cost 50 bucks or more. This is an amazing deal. The belt looks good too.
B009UY8M0C|5|I bought this corset for a masquerade and I can't wait to show it off next month. I'm 5'10 with a 34A bust and 27 waist and I felt the small size was exactly what I needed. I was a little worried it would be too small, but it cinches in nice and snug and feels very sturdy. The package came within 2 weeks as well, so that was a great surprise! I'm by no means a corset connoisseur, but I think I'll be judging future corsets based on this one.
B00FGBH63M|1|Wide brim but a very narrow hat part. Sits on your head like a stovepipe. Ended up giving mine away to a small person.
B00817EA82|4|I like them the legs don't ride up and the band fits well
B00LBXXV6A|5|Love the way this fit and looks on
B00BJOTQ6K|5|Did just what it was suppose to do!!! He so enjoyed it would buy it again for him maybe in a different color!!!
B000OT2BZE|5|Lookeds everywhere for this key case. It is definetly not in stores. My mother-in-law just had to have this type key case. She is extremely happy
B00887KZ02|5|I wear these for all events that need a tie.  It looks and feels like a perfectly-tied tie.  This is in no way a clip-on.
B00BCRMW6U|5|The hats arrived on time and were exactly as pictured/described. The black and pink were gifts to my niece. She wore the &#34;fabulous&#34; black one and I wore the &#34;stunning&#34; ivory to her bridal tea (shower). To say the least, they were absolutely gorgeous and we both received complaints out the wazoo.
B00HEDAOL6|4|fun and comfortable…the number of small hooks, kinda bothersome, but not a deal breaker…..would order again
B002R0FGOQ|1|Pilled almost immediately. Looked good for a couple of hours. The fit was OK. Don't recommend for young children. Material needs to be handled with extreme care.
B00KRCGQ7C|5|Awesome jacket! Warm!
B003DW39N2|5|The item did not have a description so I was leery of ordering but ...... it's EXACTLY what I wanted.    It's distressed with a velcro strap closure on back.  That leaves an opening for a pony tail if needed!
B009APXBE8|5|Great dress - perfect for New Year's.  Love that it doesn't wrinkle!
B00DMEAZGA|5|I've only had it for two weeks, but it is thick and appears as though it will last for years.  The distressed look is not overdone, as most distressed clothes these days seem to be.  The snaps work nicely with both plaque and traditional buckles (I'm using a plaque).<br /><br />This belt fits perfectly in the loops of Levis 550's, 505's, and 501's.  It is a 2&#34; belt, and will not fit through the loops of my dress slacks.  However, it would look out of place on dress pants.  The leather appears slightly brown, due to the distressing.  While this looks fine with jeans and sneakers, it would make choosing between black and brown dress shoes difficult.  I'm sure someone with more style than I and a better stocked wardrobe could make this work in a business casual setting.<br /><br />It shipped fast, too.
B006R694OO|5|I love this corset!  And don't be fooled by the beautiful detailing, this corset is not just for fashion because it offers excellent support right where you'd want it most.  I bought it for my wedding anniversary (mainly to wear it at home) but have already worn it twice when going out.  It fits so well with my form-fitting outfits that I almost forgot that I was wearing it!  This is my first corset from Corset Buy, but certainly not the last.  I am also very pleased with Amazon's superior (and super-fast) shipping service, and I am already recommending Corset Buy to my friends.  Thank you Amazon!
B00QVCSKY4|5|Perfect for petites! 4'11&#34; and around 115 lbs and it fits like a dream!
B0030Y1930|1|I'm in decent shape and this pushes what fat I do have in my mid section under the bra. If &#34;muffin bottoming&#34; was a thing, that's what this does to me. I will probably never wear it. I expected this to fit the way the picture shows, but maybe that's photoshopped.
B00H9H5JXU|3|The pink is almost neon not pale pink as pictured but still a nice shirt. May be able to wear after pregnancy as loose tunic. Nice quality. You'll probably have to wear a racer back or strapless bra unless you like showing bra straps.
B00R0Q7MPI|5|Love this top!! I wasn't sure what to expect when I received it - wore it to my body compact class and the support was there. It's also super comfortable I didn't feel like I was wearing a stuffy sports bra!
B0001NLHUS|3|I've used the umbrella maybe 5 times since i purchased it and it has already started leaking. I'm pretty disappointed because otherwise, it has been great: small size, easy to open and close.
B000NVUY02|5|Great for wearing under a lite jacket or by it self.
B003D3NUGM|5|Great training pants. Loved the fact that it is cotton. The fit is good true to size and comfy fit.
B008X7DITC|5|The quality of the suitcase is great! Very durable, as I took this on a 9 week work trip around the US. The colors are vibrant and easy to spot at baggage claim. It is lightweight, and the inside mesh layers are nice. Its keeps everything where it needs to be. The outside pockets are nice and deep as well. I would buy this bag again, no regrets on this purchase!
B00BIPTRAA|5|I bought these for my twin daughters for gymnastic class and they are so adorable. Fit was great for my two year olds.
B00062NHI4|5|fiance wears these. Great/perfect fit, soft.
B00BU2L95W|5|I love love love the fit I usually wear mediums and took a chance on a small and THEY FIT LIKE A GLOVE AMAZINGLY!!
B00M82WVSW|2|Runs very small.
B00GBBVJPW|5|Speedy delivery, I love it!
B00NBPBG22|5|Good quality. Really good product and value.
B00J357FLA|5|My sisters and I wore these scarfs for Breast Cancer Awareness. Happy with the product
B007SJY1OW|5|Absolutely love this outfit bought for my little girl whos just turned 2. she is a little on the small side but this fits her great she loves dressing up in it .trying to make her wait till halloween is very hard. it's very well made and great fast service i will be buying other items from this seller again thanks x
B00E0H71QA|5|I was worried to purchase a jacket online for only $37 for my son because everywhere else (LLBean and others) winter jackets are over $100 for kids.  I was so amazed by the quality of this jacket, I would order a second.  It can be used 4 different ways and is easy to go from one phase to the other with buttons and zippers to detach the fleece inner jacket from the outside colder weather one.  It's such good quality I know I will be able to pass it on to my younger son so we will get  6 years out of it!
B0019SH6H2|1|The material was too sheer and looked like it would not hold up well.  The size was way too small, even for a slim fit.
B00N2KQZTU|1|Ridiculous. Good fit for a child. I ordered an x large and gave it away. What's so difficult about getting American sizing correct? Cheap product, looks like plastic. Took forever to arrive.
B003CI560Q|5|Beautiful Hat - Super Fast Shipping - Great Price!
B00XAOX0OG|1|The design makes it difficult to use the product
B00KVBHKMY|4|I love this top but it is too small for me. I ordered another in a size bigger and one was sent in the same size so I have 2 that are too small (sleeves are not loose enough) Thankfully the top looks great on my 14yr old daughter and she loves it!
B00ELC3Y88|2|These t-shirts are very thin and way too small. I bought these in size 18 months, yet they are smaller than my 12-month t-shirts from Carter.
B008IAGPA8|4|The material is very stiff and it will not soften but the look nice otherwise.
B00NNXA2W2|5|This product is great
B004SND3EU|5|I ordered this for myself and was very pleased when it arrived to find that it is exactly like the picture.  It was great during my camping trip with my horses & good friends.  We all sat around the campfire with our funny hats cooking S'mores in 30 degree weather.  Lots of compliments on the hat as it kept my head & ears toasty.  I also really like the red hair tuff instead of a pom-pom.
B00GIE19L6|5|Fits great and the price is perfect!
B00B6EAD8S|5|Nice heavy,warm hoodie.just a little snug for me,but wearable.
B003L3QF16|5|pretty
B00F6U5JQO|5|I love it!! It is elegant and so very warm and comfortable. I cannot believe how affordable this hat is, considering the high quality. It's stunning! I bought the silver one, it's gorgeous!
B000Q0CUQG|1|Do NOT purchase this piece of junk.  It claims to take 15-20 minutes to heat water, but after two hours the water was barely above room temperature.  Do NOT Waste Your Money.
B00PQXGZ0K|5|Ordered this as a gift for my daughter-in-law and she loved it!
B00RKZI7LC|5|Loose, light, comfortable, and such a cool print, I want these in every shape and size. They're my go-to pants for relaxed days, sleep, grocery runs, and I definitely need more in my life.
B00Q7H26MA|4|I bought as a gift came as shown in the picture
B007WA1YJW|5|Perfect!!!!!!!
B00PBFTMLC|4|Cute color and fabric but size up!
B003N9BVQW|5|Awesome
B00GNJ3IEW|3|I LOVE the warmth and look of the cardigan, but the belt is not the best (It easily unclips)
B00HJA6IX2|5|Great little accessory!  Lightweight,  not too bulky, stretch material for ease of putting over head. Have worn it under a coat as well as alone with just a pullover sweater or tunic top.  Would purchase other colors.
B00DYY6ZCG|5|Excellent!!!!
B00EZ04AL6|1|This sweater is MUCH smaller than it appears on the model. I am 5'3 and 100 lbs and it is super small on me. The arm is length is really short and the sweater is short at the butt as well. It will not keep you warm in the winter time. I bought it cause I want that look...the over sized style but it really disappointed me. Do not buy this.
B003DA5YRI|5|Very good for shaping baby's growing leg, and keep the lower extremities at the right temperature.
B00BL2HB62|5|Fit as expected
B00HRS5FWQ|3|It fits!!!!! But it looks soooooo cheap.  The lace is old lady looking and the black material is not going to withstand a session in the washing machine on delicate cycle.
B00NLMOF6O|5|I love the flip-top bucklre, so much easier and holds belt in place better than the regular buckle.
B003WMTODM|3|These scrubs are comfortable but run a little large.
B00EBNOQNO|4|Wish I could give it a 5 star! The magnet is very good as advertised. Would carry my everyday standard load. But, when opportunity demands, the magnet closure is just not adequate.  If it were a spring steel clip wrapped with leather, I would have no doubt adopted it as my new wallet of choice.  I was looking for an improvement over my standard front pocket wallet I've been using for over 25 to 30 years. This one came very close. I will keep it and gift it to someone. Very good try! Very classy LQQK and feel! No doubt a great buy and product.
B001JBNDLW|5|Good
B00L4WIKXW|5|Very pretty and comfortable, fits true to size.
B00JK9JDGY|5|This is such a cute sweater.So soft and great  design.Good quality.It washes well.Runs small so order one size up
B004URS47U|3|Rather cheaply made.  It worked out for what it was - a Halloween costume, but was only able to be used once.  The under skirt ripped just by putting it on.
B000V5KZLI|4|I LIKE THE VERSATILITY AND IT'S MANY POCKETS
B009WRRX4I|5|Got a couple for our grandchildren and they excited to have them. It is snowing today and they will be put to good use quickly. The quality was good and the grandchildren were happy...what more could you ask for!
B00JM8MWTI|5|Socks fit great. Breathable on top with nice pads on bottom. Great for working out or running.
B008MPZVL8|5|I am a 5'3, 140 pound female, I bought a men's size medium, and the shirt fits very well. Print is great, shirt quality is heavy duty. Love, love , love it.
B00G30VQAO|5|I really like these onesies. So much that I tried to find them in the next size also. They're cute, soft and they fit well. Very great price for 5 onesies!
B00IE9PJFA|3|Tshirt was small to begin with, shrunk in cold water wash
B009CWATFI|5|Great
B0079W1OWU|5|I can't wait to put our little girl in this summer suit. It is precious. It was exactly as described.
B00K5TF0HY|5|I love it!
B00A9YHEVU|3|While they did fit my wife, the elastic at the top did not hold them in place unlike several other brands she's worn in the past. They do look nice when they aren't slipping though.  For anyone of generous proportion intending to wear these, do yourself a favor and get a garter to go with them.
B006PHXUOU|1|First off the packaging was partially open when it arrived and the bottom was dented. I didn't bother with returning it because the cost of shipping it back would not have been worth it. My husband has had an aluma wallet last for over a year and was still going strong when I purchased this wallet. Based on reviews  being much higher on this wallet vs. the aluma wallet I went ahead and took a chance with this one. Mistake. Three weeks and done. Don't waste your money.
B0018OMIMK|1|I purchased 4 pair of Levi jeans regular and 2 pair stone washed. None fit like the old 505's I have. They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs, and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware. What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans. I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505's. It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60's has to start buying Wranglers.
B00K472FDY|5|I gambled on these because I couldn't find them in a bigger size. I wear a 31 inch jean (Gap) and these are pretty snug! They are beautiful though, so if you're a size medium or smaller, they're a GREAT buy.
B00BR7PZRI|5|Love them, soft and cozy. I'll definitely be ordering more colors.
B008OG9EUY|5|I bought this for my short 11 year old with black tights and black flats and a black shrug.  It's adorable.  She looks so grown up and she loves it.  It's a really nice looking dress especially for the price.  I'm pleased.
B009O7C2RY|5|It is a nice jacket better that I expected. it has a great look; not heavy and fits just good
B003LO1X08|3|These pants will probably last forever! They are very stiff/sturdy. But I wonder about the comfort. Do they get softer with washing? I hope so!
B00MRVPZC8|4|Like the fit and the fabric is pretty good, could be a smidgen softer. Nice color
B0013UQDAM|5|Very satisfied with these pants, the fit is perfect. They come out of the dryer ready to wear. They are great with a sport shirt are very nice with a sport coat.
B00K77HD6U|4|it's nice and warm
B00F2QTZJO|5|Thank you
B00FSB6JW4|4|I made the booboo on this order, Its a GOOD shirt and it would have fit if that was my size.
B00FFKZB7C|4|The material is great, the product seems strong.I did have to return because it is not the size it claims to be the sizes are very small so i have to order XXL and I'm a size 28 waistline.. I will most def re-order and try it again.
B005DDM3HW|3|Nice fleece - seems to be good quality, but the sizing is all wrong. I ordered a size 4 and it might fit the baby...
B00AFJSBS4|5|My daughter loves this shirt and it is so funny! It made her laugh! She wants to be an author. The color is pretty!
B00NAKDD3S|5|Bought as Christmas Gifts for my Grand daughters.  They loved them.  Good quality product.
B004Z4I6GM|4|Well once my granddaughter seen these he eyes sparkled like stars, they became he favorite pants. Okay I freely admit that it doesn't take much to make a 4 YO girl go gaga, and these did just that. She love's them, so I love them.
B00CJ6YMUM|4|I love this dress, but it was a bit too sheer, so I had to wear a slip underneath.
B009B14SA2|4|LOVE IT!  THE HAIR IS A LITTLE BIT MESSY TO WORK WITH BUT ITS A WIG, SO YOU  JUST GO WITH THE FLO...HAHAH
B00CMQ9BSM|5|Better than many belts out there on the market. It's really designed for casual wear and it's a bit wider than most, but it works well for me.
B00M6SFHXY|5|I bought this item for a costume I am assembling for an event some time in the future.  I tried it on and think it will work perfectly, it feels good, and also light and airy - just what I wanted.
B00DNVWBBO|5|Every woman should wear one of this at the office. i bought it to my wife and she love it... sexy hot stuff.
B00KTUQ7JE|5|great!
B00EZBCUEO|5|Super cute!!!
B0052RQ3MA|1|I bought this top for my daughter who is 5'6\\" tall and 116 lbs and she was not able to wear it due to it being so tight.  She's slender so this should have fit well if it was sized correctly. The sleeves were so tight it strangled her arms...leaving marks.  It is much smaller than it appears in the picture.  The fabric is Halloween Costume quality...very cheap.
B008RMEY96|3|I really love the feel of this shirt but the fit and/or cut isn't really what I thought it would be, based on the pictures. The material was lighter in weight than I expected so it doesn't lay the way it looks like it should. Pockets are shallower than I figured they would be, too. They're more like deep folds than actual pockets. Overall, I like it, but it didn't meet my expectations.
B00HZSSPMU|5|These have quickly become my favourite brand of underwear.  Will definitely be buying more. Extremely comfortable.
B007JR8DQA|4|is so god !!! the product is the same that i expect !!!!
B00801T6Q0|5|The jeans were a nice fit in the leg, compared to the \\"jegging\\" ones, for me. They seemed to be versatile and would have worked with many other items of clothing. I really liked the color and the way they seemed to fit on me. I did order a size too big, and they were a bit baggy, but I'm sure if I had gotten the correct size, they would have been a perfect addition to my wardrobe.
B00A7FI31G|1|this was a rip off i payed fully for it and in the tracking it said it was delivered but it never was. dont recomend it at all!
B001V8YNUI|5|Got this for my husband and its his BEST shirt. washes well and hardly need to iron it. excellent quality
B0012OBWKU|2|It looked like it would be a good product, but it is sized about 2 sizes too small for what it should be. It should be labelled a L-XL instead of 2X.
B00KHKZBTI|5|love it!  Fit is perfect to size and very comfortable
B00HNI8X9C|5|looking good
B00FRIIFUW|5|I purchased this as a gift for my son to give to his God mother. She loved it! She said the material is very soft and cozy. Great gift!
B001JQLP12|2|The bra did not fit my size that I was measured for, I would suggest that a person order a cup size larger then they would normally use to have it fit them. Also, it's not very well made and doesn't appear as though it would last a long time. Better off buying a bra for a similar price at Cacique for larger cup sizes.
B0087635PG|3|Perfect!
B00I9E7YB2|5|Great
B00G570LGU|4|ordered these as nightwear for my son and he likes them. cool cotton comfy. do not fall that great but are snug around the waist
B00DNSOMKA|4|I like it
B00JEDTUP0|5|She is more endowed than I am, but we were both able to wear the Medium size. Love the message and so did our Facebook friends :-)
B00ARNQ4GY|4|Super comfy and fits perfectly. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh in the low 120s, for reference. They are fashion-forward so the pockets hang out purposely which lends it a neat look but I can see how others might be put off by it.
B0078AFMXK|1|the rips in these jeans look nothing like the pic there much much smaller and in very few places :(
B00AWL4PGC|2|she though okay
B007TSQ2TO|5|5 10&#34; 160lbs this shirt fits great. So pretty and soft. Classy and sexy. Buying more pattyboutik clothes for sure!!!
B001PBEPRC|5|Very much waht I hoped they'd be based on picture. Leg is plenty lone and material is quite thick and durable.  i bought a few more after rcvng. these.  My 12 yr old son loves these for gym.
B00QWR3CQE|5|I love this bathing suit but the tag bled into the pink so make sure you cut it out before you use it.
B00NO171B8|1|I BOUGHT THIS FOR HALLOWEEN 2014 AND WAS UPSET ABOUT HOW SMALL IT RUNS
B00EZIWRG8|5|I'm not sure why people are saying it itches. I found it to fit well, non itchy, nice soft cotton fabric ,cute pic. Love it ! I might order another one in grey .
B0035FAS3Q|5|These are my husbands favorites and too expensive to buy retail. Great fit and great price!
B001D0MVEO|5|Loved this zip up!! Very comfortable and stylish love it!!
B00M3MR2LI|5|Love the color and size was great!
B00FSKRMY4|5|My daughter looks so cute in this jacket. I absolutely love the quality. It is VERY warm. Perfect for midwest winters.
B00MXXOQ84|5|This jacket was a little roomy which we like as it was bought for a growing boy.  It was soft and puffy, warm and reasonably priced. From the photo, you can't see that it has a hood as well and that was as nice surprise. You can't ask for more than that in a jacket.
B008X0FZKY|5|It is exactly like the picture shown. The size I purchased was small, but I would say it fits like an xsmall. The sleeves are TIGHT, so I would recommend a size medium if your arms aren't super scrawny like mine. The irregular hem is very cute, shorter in the front and back area, and longer on the sides. I am 5'0\\" at 99lbs and it fits damn near close like a mini dress, but definitely wear something underneath it. There's no tag with instructions on how to care for it. I would suggest tumble dry low since this looks like fabric that could maybe develop a hole if dried too hot. I highly recommend this item and will be buying some for my friends!<br />Item arrived in a week and a half in a gray plastic bag, not too secured.<br />Tip: When ordering from Uxcell, order one at a time instead of larger quantities. You receive one $5 off coupon for each single shipment that can be used on their website.
B00DMEG1WW|5|Love this dress. Perfect color and fit
B00BPOVXJW|4|You get what you pay for. Its a nice oufift but the quality will only last you a couple times
B00LSXR6WS|5|THIS PIECE IS BEAUTIFUL!  IT IS ALL HAND SEWN, WITH AMAZING DETAIL OF PEACOCKS.  THE FRINGE IS HAND TIED, AND THE SEQUINS ARE APPLIED ONE AT A TIME.  iF YOU WANT A WRAP FOR EVENING, OR TO DRESS UP THAT 'BLAH' WORK DRESS, THIS SHAWL WILL DRESS ANYTHING UP.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!  TAKE A CHANCE - YOU WON'T BE SORRY - IT'S GORGEOUS!!<br /><br />EMCW
B003XDT5QQ|5|These basic leggings from Steve Madden are guaranteed to be comfortable, and they do not disappoint. These leggings should fit nicely for anyone and though this is your basic legging look, you can use it for any style. Unless you have [[ASIN:B00A7P8SS4 Lysse leggings for women - Tight Ankle Legging]], these basic legwear should do nicely for whatever occasion you have planned.
B00KOHB7YC|5|Bought for my 14 yr. old granddaughter's birthday - big hit!  Seems to made with high quality materials and fits perfectly for size ordered.  Super fun in the pool, but should be used by very good swimmers or supervised by adult.
B0006I7I10|4|Just received it in mail. It feels smooth by touch, but a little bit thin and transparent. It will be great when wearing in warmer weather either as a slip or a night gown.
B00K5FZVR2|4|cute scarves
B00SM902ZY|4|The hat is great for the price.  The material and quality of the hat is top.  It's just the face of the cap, above the writing sticks up a bit to much, some people might like that for me it's a picky issue.  If it wasn't for this I'd buy a bunch of their different  hats.  I might try one more style just to see if it's better.  All they need to do is round that one spot top center of forehead the slightest bit and they'd have the best hat for the price.
B00C2MAR48|3|Fit was a little small but not too bad. Good material but unsure how it will hold up over time.
B003KYSTVU|3|I like this coat it would have been a great winter coat but unfortunately not true to size and was too small. too much of a hassle to send back.
B00FOARCV6|2|Ordered an Extra Large .. Didn't know that the shirts from the U.K. Run small .. Needed an 2+ Large
B00EYI7OTO|4|I thought this sweater was going to be bigger since its an open front sweater without any clasps but its actually rather fitted.  The arms are a little tight but I still love it. The pattern and thickness are exactly what i was expecting/hoping for.  Its a great sweater!!
B004VQBJZ4|3|kinda boring, but comfy.
B007PZQWO6|5|I like it
B00B2HURLC|4|They are as pictured.
B00MRQ7P26|3|I love the style but not the quality. It came in too large for my baby. But its a nice dress with cheap fabric
B007C91QY6|5|Bought this for my hubby (a Bowie fan) and he LOVES it. Some t-shirts, especially concert or rock t-shirt are made of that cheap Heavy DUTY t-shirt material that will last 25 years but feel restrictive and bulky. My husband adores this shirt because its, light, soft and extremely comfortable. The cut and drape are very flattering as well and the graphic is the bomb. Excellent value -- wish we could find a dozen more t-shirts that fit and felt as good with different colors and artists.
B00JSAR83A|5|Fit great and really comfortable 👍
B00B4IA09S|5|Gift for my daughter she loves them
B00K1RITXC|5|My daughter loved this.
B00IAYHA1U|5|It fit as was expected. The color was as advertised. It made a great gift.
B00AQEWN5K|3|The jacket has really nice material with a slight sheen. The fit is weird though. I ordered a medium (I'm a tall 6) and it's really bellows out trapeze coat style, but is slightly snug in the shoulders. I'm keeping it because the fabric is nice, the fit is bearable, and I just moved to Seattle so I really need a hooded jacket.
B00S850GTE|5|Great quality. Great fit. Showed up much sooner than was quoted/expected. Comes in a really neat burlap type bag with Sarah's contact info.
B000TA529A|5|Very comfortable
B009MI6JZG|5|This coat fit just as the sizing chart indicated.  I'm an average 5'11&#34; 175 lb guy, a little muscular, and everything fits just as expected.  It does seem to be machine washable just fine, It's made of very sturdy material(Worn for multiple days, and doesn't stretch at all like most jackets will), and I've received more compliments wearing this jacket than any of my other jackets, and I'm a fairly stylish guy.  Definitely my favorite jacket thus far.  But I do have another Lees jacket on the way, so we'll see.
B005KSJASA|4|The only thing negative I can say about this coat is it does have an odor....  Other than that fantastic coat.  I think the rubber/chemical smell will wear off with some wear and air.  Well constructed, warm but vented so you do not sweat too much.  Will work great to stay dry on dreary rainy days, the reflective strip on the back could be larger but it is still noticeable.
B00CAXR0BW|5|perfect
B00D4282X8|4|I love the versatility of this bag. It gives great option in any setting I find myself in and has great space to not only fit my MacBook but also all my text books for school. I walk every where and this is extremely useful when walking, road tripping, or going to class. The only downside is that the material is a little thinner than I would like. I'm rough on things and need durability. But, so far so good. I totally recommend the purchase.
B00J7W1L3C|4|I bought a medium and the arms are perfectly long, but I would have liked the shirt itself to be longer. It came right to my belt and I layered a cotton cami to give it the length. This is a really nicely made shirt. It is thin and tshirt like and not a thick hoodie. Love it.
B00NY4DLQE|4|Gave this to my kid likes the show  Its a T shirt  what more do you want
B00801PZTW|5|Great shirt and it's pretty good quality material.  I wasn't sure whether the material would be very good.  I like it!
B00O0L965A|2|item was extremely small compared to size I ordered, which is too bad because I love the shirt's design.
B006PI12FS|4|My previous wallet was leather and stuffed full.  So full that it was difficult to get it out of my pocket at times, and especially while in the car.  The one thing this wallet did do was make me clean out my wallet, which was a good thing.<br /><br />The wallet is slim and awesome in my opinion.  The only thing keeping it from a 4 star is what other reviewers have said that it really only holds 9 full size cards. It does seem like with a bit of re-engineering it could hold more.  But its a great value, and a great wallet.
B00FFGQB5C|5|Not cheap cotton, has some weight to it.
B004M6XUI2|5|So good. Bautiful. I love my new wallet. Excellent !!
B00O3MWD7Y|5|SSOOO SEXY! Fits very comfortable yo thought this pouch would fit a little weirdly but it fits AMAZING SOO sexy and comfy but it right now!!!! Alao makes your ass look nice and your package! ;-)
B004A8WHZE|5|Love this. Fits perfect. Love the sheer back.
B008VPQZ0A|5|I had always worn the &#34;man panties&#34; that I grew up with.  It wasn't something I actively thought about changing.  When they wore out, i went and purchased another package of em.  Then one day I ventured out and tried some boxers.  A few sets later, I enjoyed wearing boxers, but....how do I know what type to buy?  Refusing to pay an uber amount of &#34;fun tickets&#34;, I first purchased a package from a discount store.  A few months later, well, they wore out!  I starting thinking, who can I ask what brand/type they like?  I asked my 3 brothers, but they were in denial about their &#34;man packaging needs&#34;.  Its not something you can drop in conversation with the guys....&#34;Love the new set of rims on your ride, what type/brand of undies do you prefer?&#34;.  Then one day it donned on me.  Hit up Amazon and find the &#34;big guy boxers&#34; with the best reviews.  I did and they do not disappoint.  I love the way these cradle my man parts, and how well the breath when I am working out.  I ordered several pairs!  Now my undergarment drawer in my dresser looks like a psychedelic unicorn puked rainbows in it, and my man bits couldn't be happier!
B00U8JUXXM|2|Wife liked the concept but when received found they were too minimal is front coverage and the curve didn't allow it to stay in place.
B00IJAPLFM|4|Great
B007IWKE4U|4|The material is very comfy in the humid climax.  Plus it can stand machine wash<br />The simple design appeal to me.
B004IDF71M|5|Great shirt
B00PQ8HOA0|5|Looks great and fits good. I'll buy more from this brand
B004WI25FE|3|I love Levi jeans but I should've ordered size 14 instead of 16 for a better fit. I don't need long either just medium length. I'll order another pair when I get the money.
B00MWPB8D4|5|Excellent.  Thanks.!!
B0096YSBB6|5|Bought as a gift for my son. &#34;Really got it right, Dad&#34;! I was pleased with the quality both of the cap and the embroidery. It arrived earlier than expected another plus.
B00FA4WG9E|5|So perfect for my man who loves to cook and make sauces! Great price! Soft t-shirt
B0068RZX88|5|What a bargain! These are 100% cotton, but are stretchy as if they have spandex in the waistband. I am a size 5/6 and M fits me a little big on the waist, but around legs and butt I love the fit. Leg is skinny, but not glued to your ankle. Very comfortable! Can't beat the price!!!
B00QKMKP98|5|I got the hat a few days ago, and it fits quite nicely. The top part looks and feels almost like a black leather. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00IN8U2FY|3|the sleeve is really long...........others fit good
B007IFQ7JI|5|I can't say enough good things about the Patty Women line of tops.  I have purchased several.  They offer a nice style, a nice fit, and a nice fabric for a great price.  Love it!
B00M500GXE|5|Quality is quite good. When I buy a better discount! I love it.
B00V5YOEZC|1|This was a waste of my money. I'm extremely disappointed. It says one size but it done ant fit. and I'm petite. Also, there are stains all over the shirt that will not come out. Very upset!
B00T6IKLAQ|5|My daughter loved it
B00X5V7EPA|4|I like this item. The only problem was that the cuffs on the sleeves were too tight and I had to cut a slit in them to loosen them up. Other that that it is great.
B0077VKI98|5|My son needed a new work belt and wanted leather as it would last longer. I saw this on Amazon deals but wanted his ok before I bought it. By the time I got back to it the deal was over...but....for a few dollars more I could still buy it. It is a nice well made belt. Leather and comfortable to wear. He was happy and suprised when he got it.
B00L8AG4U6|4|I chose this as a test garment.  I've bought a number of mocks from different manufacturers and was pleased with the material thickness of this garment.  It's a medium weight material with a resilient collar and robust stitching.  Only time will tell, but I'm confident it's at least a 4 star compared to the others hung in the closet over the last 20+ years.  It compliments elbeco brand uniforms well.
B00NBX2N58|5|Can't beat the price! Something extra to fancy up a simple outfit. The color is awesome, nice and rich. I got a 2xl and it fits fine and I wear size 20us. I have noticed a few thread but for the price I'm not worried
B00XY7YIEA|5|Great product. Quick shipment. Highly recommend and would buy from again.
B00BEFUQNG|1|I first ordered 6-12 months which were too small. My sons other three pairs of shoes are all 6-12 months so order a size larger. I reordered in larger size and they fit however it looks like the shoes are both for the right foot. I would return them if I didn't need them for Easter Sunday this weekend. Would not recommend purchasing this shoe!
B00MVHWDIC|3|At first when I wore it, it was pretty tight but I wore it troughout the day up to 8-9 hours a day and it gave me this amazing hour glass figure but..don't get me wrong that's great but it pushes you're breast upward making them seem a bit larger. The next day it was less of a struggle. But I love how it holds everything in place. I workout everyday in the morning and when I run it feels great as well as when I bend down or move around. But throughout time when I would sweat, it would starts to sting and itch and I would develop this rash as well it rolls in the back and stabbed my side with the wire. I've also had the back fat problem.So I stopped wearing it, now I just wear it to run. But over all this product is ok
B0058DR5TS|5|Great costume!!
B00CPTK3T2|5|Love it!! Everybody said was perfect!!
B00KAKOK3I|4|The snaps and secondary pockets are fake but the main pockets are real so i guess there's that. The zipper is somewhat finicky though.
B00T9JTFT0|5|I am a Austin Mahone fan and I love this shirt.
B00AGI8W06|4|Fit is on the short side
B008BL423Q|5|We bought this for a friend who is a banquet captain. It was a huge hit. Looks good and not cheap.
B003BRBMTC|5|Fit great!
B007KCU8GW|5|My son who is in Kindergarten requested a Volcom backpack.  Very durable, and perfect for the typical boy who throws his bag all over the place!
B00IWAL8MO|5|Very nice and just as I expected.
B00EHXTMKK|5|What can I say these shorts changed my life.<br />But even though things have changed the shorts are comfortable and light weight and they are fairly well made.<br /> I will buy them again.
B00JRKEKDM|4|Great price on a great legging, nice and warm.
B004WO3TEO|5|excellent quality
B00G69KCO8|5|I work at our town’s local uranium processing plant and am a member of the bowling team “Off Constantly”. To avoid the “Sparkle Incident of 2013”, after reading the reviews we decided to use the Three Wolf Moon tee-shirt as our bowling shirts.<br /><br />I can remember this story as if it was yesterday because it was.  On the afternoon of the afternoon of the first night of the 2014 bowling league I couldn’t wait to get to the bowling alley, I had to develop a way to leave early. After much deliberation I decide to employ my tried and true method, I walked out and got in my truck without saying anything and left work.  I arrived at the bowling alley without incident. I walked in displaying the Three Wolf Moon tee-shirt on my ample frame. I got my teams table and went to the bar for a beer. As I walked by the juke box is when the magic started. Justin Bieber was playing when the was the unmistakable sound of a diamond needle against vinyl sounded then Purple Haze began oozing from the speakers which was amazing because it was a MP3 juke box.  I went to the bar, the bar maid had mostly shoulder length graying brown hair, she was wearing a white silk halter top with a pink push-up bra (I could tell it was pink by the shoulder straps on her pasty white skin) with a school girl skirt that revealed  garter belt straps connected to white stockings that connected to 8 inch stiletto stripper’s shoes. She looked my way with a smile that show a meth habit with a good dental plan, she immediately got her 5 foot 1 inch 275 pound body headed my way. “Yuengling hold the cap”, I said to her. She responded by leaning over the cooler to get my beer when she did she showed about 2 feet thong material stained the color of natural fiber bailer twine. As she immerged from the fog of the cooler I could see that she was smuggling Skoal cans in her halter top because one fell out. I paid for my beer and went back out to the alley. The rest of my team was arriving then withtheir Three Wolf Moon tee shirts and we began to bowl. As it was our first night and that is when our averages would be set we did not want to bowl too good. I have to protect my 87 pin average after all. As we began to bowl I noticed a strange going on first off the song Purple Haze kept playing over and over and over even after the breaker to the juke box was disconnected. Second each time one of us rolled the ball the other team got a strike.  I finished the night with a season high of 94. To make it even sweeter the other team had to go to work the next day telling everyone that they beat Off Constantly.
B004UABDLQ|5|I'm 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs at 33 wks. I ordered a 27 - one size up from my typical size. They fit just right! They're nice and stretchy and you don't have to worry about a band showing. The color is darker than I usually like, but the elastic is black, so it's great. You can't even tell they're maternity. They'll be great for after baby is here and I'm not quite into my old jeans. Love them!
B000FGXZE2|2|This bag is very large. I ordered it for carrying my laptop and other work related items. The leather on the side of the handle puckers up and does not look even. When the bag is closed and hanging on my sholder the leather is not even. I returned the bag. I took three stars ( 1 for the size, 1 for the leather folding and the other for the markings on the leather)
B00IWLRTDU|5|I have a 32 in waist and weigh 165  5' 8&#34; tall and the med fit just right
B004LRO48M|5|Very sexy. Fits wife perfect (5'3'', 105lbs., 34A).
B002LVR5TU|4|Very good.
B005KN7V3G|5|A friend of mine had this sweatshirt and I just had to have one. Seriously, it is hard to take it off. I love it! Very warm and cozy and a comfortable fit. Highly recommended!!
B004HHL61E|5|I had bought a beige pair at a store and than saw these online.  I ordered them and they are the same quality but much less money as the pair I bought at the store. Great for driving. and phoning.  They arrived sooner than expected and packaging was good.
B008A25QFO|5|If you're like me and don't like underwires, push-ups, or padding, this is the bra for you!  It fit as expected and is sooooo comfortable.  I'm really happy with this bra.  Only thing is I wish this bra came in different colors, or better yet, skin-toned.  The skin-toned bras can be worn underneath any white-colored clothing and doesn't show at all.
B00F9F48RM|5|Totally love this skirt would recommend it To a friend. If you decide to purchase this skirt you will love it
B00XGHDGFU|5|Great fabric!!
B00J48UGM6|5|Very happy with the costume it fit as I thought and looks good for the parties, the sword completed what I was looking for.  it arrived on time and in great shape.
B00ODFKTCC|5|Fun scarf.
B00RSRXFQE|4|Kind of snug on my wife and is a deep dark purple not as light as pictured but looked good on her and she was happy.
B00KWIKGSQ|3|Its pretty, but its samall..I need for my girl she have 6 years old, she is thin, but the dress is small for her.
B00JXF1VT2|5|I listen to my heart<br /> The size of the clothes is so well
B00K3DFRO8|5|Bought this for my girlfriend, wasn't expecting much for the price but the quality was actually rather nice! decent stitching and the fabric was a decent weight. I grew up in my mom's wedding shop so I know a thing or two about fabric.<br /><br />Overall very happy about the piece for the price, only con is that the size small was a bit large, but still fit okay.<br />(chest area is for a small cup person, as you can tell from the stock photo)<br /><br />I didn't experience any of the nativities the other reviews stated.<br /><br />The print is really nicely printed, looks better in person.
B00DOZNYOC|5|I have a drawer full of bras.  Literally.  Figuratively. (pun intended) I have always been on the quest for the &#34;perfect&#34; bra.  Losing battle.  Bras are not cheap either so when you buy a bra and end up tossing it in your bra drawer, you are so let down.  Punny, I know. Let's dispense now with the cliches and review the Bali Womens Comfort Revolution Wirefree Bra.  I love it!  I was browsing through the Today's deals on Amazon one day and I saw this bra.  I read about it and decided I would order two and give them a try.  The bras came and I tried one on.  I couldn't believe it.  The fit was as if it were made for me.  Comfort.  The bra's straps were so soft on my shoulders and the fit around my chest was supportive and comfortable as well.  By the end of the day I had forgotten I was even wearing a bra.  I needed to buy two more of these bras so I got on Amazon and did just that.  I now had four of these bras.  I went in the bottom drawer and chose four bras to throw away.  Comes in and goes out, my new motto.  This past year I have been disabled by a back problem so I can't do my laundry as much as I would like to, so I ordered two more of the bras.  I was feeling very confident and two more bras from the bottom drawer ended up in the trash.  Whew.  Two days ago the bras came up on the Today's deals again and guess what?  I ordered two more!  They haven't come yet, probably today, but I will have eight of these wonderful bras.  I am in Heaven.  It brightens my day to put on one of these bras because I know I will never have to fight loose straps, won't have to pull down anymore riding up bras and I can throw away my bra extenders which I was collecting in another drawer!  Yesterday I made a bold move, I went through my bra drawer and took about six of the nicer bras and put them in my Salvation Army bag.  I don't know if the Salvation Army wants used bras or not but these are still very nice looking (and expensive) and have only been worn once or twice.  Ihave found the perfect bra and I congratulate the team at Bali that came up this bra because it is a comfort revolution, beyond anything I could have ever hoped for in a bra.  Will I get more than 8?  probably.  They are so well made though I can't see me having to replace them from wear or tear.  5 stars for this bra and if I could give them six stars I would.  Bali, thank you for your support.  (pun intended!)
B00FAAVQV2|5|excelente
B000KAWMII|5|Absolutely love this style. Comfortable and fits like a glove. I had been buying this style for many years at local retail shops, but now, they don't carry it anymore. I will now buy from Amazon.
B0068OUMI2|5|I love these art ties. The colors are so vivid, the length and width are classic without being too wide or too skinny. The length is great, and the feel of the tie is (to my boorish sensibilities) indistinguishable from silk. In short, they're quite wonderful as a statement to make in the office. This one will be my &#34;Monday&#34; tie, because for me, Mondays invoke existential dread.
B00GA7VXCQ|5|Great.
B006ZJCH7Y|5|I like these shorts,
B00EFCBMNI|3|See through. Works great to layer under scrubs, but don't buy unless you want to layer it.
B00KFS478S|5|I absolutely love these.  This is perfect, the color is great and they are so incredibly comfortable.  I think I've gone back and purchased at least five more already.  They have just the right amount of stretch to fit well and still look great.  I will definitely be getting these for a few people as Christmas gifts this year!
B00IK02JMY|4|the over all fit is good, it's just a bit shorter than i would have liked. It's adorable and thin and will be fine for &#34;hot yoga&#34;
B00C86O5NC|2|I have the Mavi Alexa Jeans the Super Dark Rinse, so I ordered these in the same size. They didn't fit at all, they seemed like 2 sizes smaller than what I currently have. There was barely any stretch in the jeans! Don't size down.
B0119R7I5W|4|Fits well and as expected.  Colors are just like the pictures. Arrived far sooner than estimated.
B00M3YIWB0|3|I am a huge fan of dresses with pockets but this dress definitely runs extremely small. I am normally an XS (pre-pregnancy) so I ordered a medium just in case & it definitely was very short & tight! I had to return it & unfortunately they did not have a larger size available.
B00HQ90KMG|5|Very comfy
B00CEY2U8A|5|I washed & dried this and it is soft and comfy to wear.  It is 100% cotton and I do not get overheated in it, which is why I ordered it.  Can't wait to wash it again as I am sure it will get softer.  Great value!
B00IFXPCH0|3|Cute dressed and well done .. just too small usually I am xs / 0 my height is 5.4 and weight 110lib.. the zipper up my back :(..
B002HFP54C|5|This dress was better then I expected, fits like it was made just for me. My husband was also happy with the way the it looked on me!;-)
B00PJ1GO5K|5|I ordered this wallet for my husband for our third anniversary.  It is the year of Leather.  He really liked it.  It was in great condition and arrivied in a timely mannor.
B00V2EGI6I|5|Beautiful Scarf with Spring/Summer flowers
B00G6P2GI2|5|This company makes the best fitting PJ's
B005DD9JHO|5|Prior to this shirt, I have never had any experience with this company. They offer very unique styles, and it's a Korean based company.  The shirt is very durable, it kind of wears like an under armor or a very tight slim fit shirt. It will show your physique completely, so if your a person who is not comfortable of their body, then I would avoid this product. The neck design is very well stitched and look as if your wearing a scarf. Overall great shirt, and a great buy for the buck if the fashion appeals to you.<br /><br />*Other information*<br />Keep in mind these shirts come based in Korean sizes. Korean size is pretty much one size larger than what we would wear in America. For example if you regularly wear medium, you will need to order a large.<br /><br />Let me know if my review was helpful thank you!
B00248WUOA|5|Really cool
B00L3Y3IX8|4|Really cool design, gorgeous top, it just fits funny.
B00C2DJ81K|3|Just like everyone said, it runs really small! luckily i read all the reviews before ordering it, usually i'm a extra small or small so i ordered a medium. it it took me awhile the first time to get it on, but after practice it doesn't take that long. fits snug which its supposed to. so far i like it. worked out in it and my stomach sweated a lot!!
B00EAQZ85W|5|These are the best shorts I've ever owned. I bought three pair 5 years ago.  Summertime daily wear. Wear like iron.  Many pockets including nail bags. Shed dirt and stains and are super durable. I'd like to find a couple more pair in my size. They make Carhart stuff seem flimsy. Great for work or play.
B00JVFVEW8|3|Nice color, s soft material
B00NCB7M50|5|very nice quality
B00EK93ZUO|5|I really like this top, fits nicely... very clingy, but also very stretchy. I have a very large bust size & this shirt actually fits around them comfortably ;p I normally wear an XL, but a large was perfect. You can't complain about the price either!
B007KFZE3G|3|Left cut/marks under bust.
B00COP5HJI|4|Its ok. Thought is like t shirt fabric but fits good.
B006VGUE3A|4|Fit well and are fun to wear
B00GG2GIO8|5|Love the quality of the shirt! The graphics are nicely done and exactly as pictured too! would recommend this to everyone!
B0014Z5G72|5|At the throwaway price I got this jacket for, I never thought it would be of good quality...but I was wrong! Not only the quality was good, the looks too was too good. My wife likes it very much and she's happy that the material is quite good and thick and keeps her warm during chill weathers. Would love to buy such more products from ClassicCloseOuts in the future!!
B0064YY2M8|5|Does what it supposed to do without making me feel like I can not breathe.  Very pretty too and does<br />not squash the the bra area.  I liked so much that I ordered one in black.<br />Takes away the muffin top very nicely.  Delivery was prompt as usual.
B0002MBB5E|5|This was my 3rd reorder of these shorts in various colors and I can't recommend them highly enough.  They are tough and comfortable and are very reasonably priced for the quality.
B006G5FMLA|4|Exactly as described. Good quality, although it does run a little small. Recommend purchasing the next size up. My ten year old daughter and her friends are completely obsessed with the Hunger Games and it was nice to find something for her that was a little different than the rest. She loves this shirt!!!
B007SRZO1I|5|Perfect, just what I wanted, the material is great and is exactly equal to the photo, I love this purchase
B00M5MKVK0|5|Love love love it!!!!
B00TH5DS7Q|5|I love this product! The top and the bottom fitted perfectly!
B008QWP31A|4|look  and fit as expected, comfortable
B00RLCELN2|5|Beautiful blouse! Color is perfect and very comfortable and light for summer.
B00DJIH6V6|5|Fits great.
B00E8GRMDA|4|Could have been a little longer, but still wearable
B000RL7V0O|5|This Shirt fits well and size is accurate, great classic logo for Thundercats. The shirt didnt shrink much in wash.
B00DYF100W|4|Some of the socks fit great, some a bit too tight.
B002LMK9ZG|4|well made very cool.
B00IJJOKM8|5|Beautiful, great price & quick delivery
B00JSM1MDA|3|I thought this dress would have plenty of length since it the photo looks like the dress hits just below the model's knee. Either the model  is 12 years old or she is a Pygmy. I am 5 foot 1 and the dress is above my knees. Also the satin belt was not sewn properly (about 4 inches of the material not sewn together) and the skirt was sewn into the slip. This makes it hang crooked. The left side of the top layer of the skirt is longer than the right side. This is part of the design, though I did not notice this before ordering. When the dress is actually worn, this affect makes the dress look like the hem is uneven.  I gave it three stars because the shipper said I didn't  need to return it and refunded my money. The dress on it's own would get 1 star. There is no way I am wearing this for my daughter's wedding. Overall, I am very disappointed with this dress.
B00BW4WRIQ|5|I love this shirt. I'm glad the picture is on the back. The fit is good. I just love Turtleman!
B00C283LVS|1|Extremely generic looking. Not happy!
B00F4O2J3I|5|Love this robe. It is so soft and snugly. You will love this robe. Washes nicely and dries great. Love the color.
B00C7USPDU|4|Small than discprtive
B00FXIGT04|1|These are for little girls! Made the mistake. I thought they were women's. So they came way to small. Should have been more clear.
B000KK696E|5|great value
B0041230C8|5|My daughter wore this pair of socks with the matching tutu dress, headband and bloomers for her first birthday party. She also has a lot of other zebra and pink outfits that will also match...cannot go wrong with these adorable socks.
B007NMZP8K|5|Very cute, stylish jeans!<br />Very interesting and beautiful print.<br />Though in which 98% of cotton, they are very well stretching.<br />I recommend to all :-)
B005OFLSUM|4|the b&oacute;xers is very comfortable, has been a very good buy and better yet, I went to great price boxers
B004Y3KBFI|1|sounds like the real deal, but these are just flimsy cheap robes. Did I mention I could read the print on my tee shirt through them? Not what I'd wear - ever. I am returning them (depending on the company's return policy) While there is no way to tell online how they will feel, the name of the product and of the company are more than slightly misleading... in my opinion.
B0098ASIXO|4|The top doesn't cover much whole stomach was showing. Had to wear something under. Hat doesn't fit on head at all lol way too small.. Really liked it though.
B003JKL2ZA|5|Bought these pajamas for my 5 year old daughter (size 7 - have learned to always buy pj's a size larger for her) and she loves them.  So far, they wash and dry great and she's a dinosaur maniac - loves the design.
B006HY2GUK|5|Bought for after my pregnancy, and I was skeptical about quality. I ended having an emergency c-section and this shape wear became my best friend. After a c-section you're mobility is limited and using belts and binders, such as the ones the hospital provides, is hard. You can't really put it on yourself, must be tight to feel comfortable, and the binder keeps rising up . Although this shape wear, after a c-section is tricky to put on and must be put on slowly, after it was on I felt better and able to move. Honestly don't know where I'd be without it.
B00L8MVBJI|5|Awesome
B00EUFIYS6|5|This shirt is great! The fit is true to size and is overall great quality. I highly recommend this shirt to any Star Wars Fan!
B00FDZOGK2|5|Nice shirt
B00HY7N1IU|2|the blue part of this scarf is to thin and flimsy
B00JJ5FWN2|3|love the color and style just wish it fit me better. Super snug in some areas.
B00EAI228Q|5|Fits great. I'll be ordering another pair or two.
B006KXVLAY|5|My daughter loved those leg warmers.  She's been using every day.  They keep her warm and so charming!<br />I'll probably order some more !
B00ND4SP7U|4|I like a robe to be a little on the large side so, although I wear a Medium, I ordered an X-Large.  However XL in Asian sizes is not the equivalent of XL in American sizes.  It's very comfortable and very, very warm.  I just wish it was a little larger.
B00A1QCP2O|2|this corset is sturdy and well made, but i bought it because i liked the pink accents and the halter strap, neither of which exist on the corset i recieved. i will probably keep it as my bf loves camo, but i am NOT in love with the fact that the product is misrepresented.
B0014CJTF0|5|excellent product and meet what we buy. thanks
B005WJ4RN0|5|great hat many compliments.. better feel than expected and a very nice value.
B00C4NZYIE|5|Feels great on and I had many comments on how good it looks. I will be wearing this for long while.
B009O8LZMG|5|I love this dress. It actually makes me feel attractive while pregnant! It's super soft, washes well, and it's so versatile. Every modern pregnant woman needs a dress like this!
B00HWOUPG6|5|What a beautiful robe ! Exceeded my expectations.
B00C2DJ81K|5|I love it! I wear It when I work out . The  Material is thick I got a size Medium. I used to be 139 pounds and so far I've  lost 10 pounds just by wearing it everyday and working out of course. I would highly recommend.
B0080CACZ8|4|I just got the package and pulled 'em open to see how things look.<br /><br />My initial thoughts:<br /><br />1)  They fit as expected for my size 12.5 to 13 wide feet.  Yea!<br />2)  They are nicely soft<br />3)  They are, as other reviews mention, thicker than dress socks but thinner than many 'casual' socks.  Just what I was looking for.<br />4)  I didn't notice it before buying, but the stitching on the toe is color coded, so I'll be less likely to mis-match the grey pair with the brown/olive pair. Bonus feature!
B002F1SVQW|5|I love my hat. It fits me just right and keeps my head and ears warm. It was perfect for a night by the campfire.
B0051EFL4A|5|They fit a bit bigger than I'd expected, but a belt solves that problem & they are still very comfortable. Washed at least 10 times already & not falling apart - that's better than most clothes these days.
B003EELO1I|5|exelente
B00I9ABM14|5|A+++++
B00JE1YO80|4|Exactly what I was looking for. Great and light for the summer.
B0046MFRD8|5|I bought a pair for a friend for Christmas.  In the next month he went into the hospital for 30 days and requested another pair.  I ended up buying him four pair in all.  They could be washed and returned to the hospital and stood up wonderfully.  The nurses thought he was the best dressed patient on the unit.
B0015I390O|2|This bra is not a &#34;B&#34; size cup, as I ordered.  This is more like a DD cup - horrible under clothing!  The light foam lining in the cup flattens out in the front and looks ridiculous.  Was going to order another in black, but after trying on this one.....forget it!
B007ZHU0LK|2|These run very small.  Usually I wear a 0 or 2.  I think i would need a medium!
B007N3VKME|3|Nice
B004UKO1Q0|5|These thermals are cool. I've already bought three of these. These thermals feel nice and do keep me warm for some chilly weather.
B00ADX8G5K|2|A little large. Slips around
B001AEVHUC|5|Good Hat for the Summer months,Fantastic for the Shore,Florida Disney Parks ,California weather,and anywhere in the world with hot weather.
B005F80034|5|Love these thick black Winter  LEGGINS XL
B00N4UDDOS|1|It comes  a very short sweater, like regular sweater. At least 6&#34; shorter than the picuture.  same color, quality is decent.
B0002TOZ1O|4|Well, these are decent socks for sure. Comfortable for the most part, warm, etc... But I feel like it is too long and the leg feels tight... maybe I'm not just used to the crew socks.
B004SPO3NI|3|So, it is a quality tee.  Nice design and has held up well. However, a \\"portion\\" consists of $1....at least according to the tag on the t-shirt I purchased.  So, buy the shirt if you like it and want to make a statement, but donate directly to the Red Cross if you want to make a bigger impact with your money.
B00H1CCZMG|5|Best winter pants in the world!! Worth every penny
B0038N58XK|5|Fits wonderfully... much better then the Medela brand sleep nursing bra. Very supportive.
B00EPRIF8I|4|The material isn't strechy that would have helped
B00OZHO564|5|This is just like my old one, long wearing, very rugged, Very happy with this coat.
B003TM4SH2|5|These were just what I was looking for.  They snugly hold all of my credit cards and gift cards.  But not too snug that it's not easy to get them out.  Just perfect!
B0012QM8IS|5|Not a bra for support but it sure is comfy and washes up beautifully.  If you like something that is light and comfortable, this is it.  I tried one in black and just ordered another 4! The cup fits perfectly also, not bunchy.  Just a great overall bra if you want something that's next to nothing.  Really cool to wear too!  The best I've found so far and the price is good.
B0007YXTT8|5|I paid alot for this same bra at Kohl's and ordered my second one from Amazon, it fit perfect!
B0006FUDI8|5|Really looks scary, the mask doesn`t like I think, looks better like a neoprene mask but really looks great these costume.
B00PE739V6|3|The sleeves are waaaaaaay too long. Very strange. Possible defect?
B008XFJJF6|5|It fits well, might be a little big, and I should have gone with the Large instead of the XL because it gets a little bit bunchy around the waist.  I love the length, both the body and the sleeves are nice and long.  The pocket is more for looks than function, but I can hide a tube of lipstick in it.  It washes well.  I used the hand wash cycle on my machine and let it dry on a sweater rack and have had no problems with shrinking, fading or pilling.
B00CPFA2FQ|1|Keep a tight grip on your credit card.  No jeans are worth $86 let alone the suggested $172!!  Turn and run before you get sucked in on this scan.
B0031U0OVG|3|It's ok..........very stiff.
B00FXY16WO|4|The shirt is very cute.  They tell you that it is compression and when they say &#34;fits like second skin&#34; they are NOT kidding.  Order a size up unless you want it to be skin tight.
B00ACIGNGU|5|i like it
B00GQYVILY|5|Love it, soon I will order the dark brown.
B00422M6JK|5|Perfect size, great leather quality and has lots of storage slots<br />and the packaging is great the box is very elegant and looks great
B00B72XXB8|5|Great tshirt!
B00M9ZK0EA|4|Fits my son about right. Just a little tight on the calf.
B00JSJ74WQ|5|This shirt fit my big guy great. Ordered the 4x. Not too baggy or tight. Only thing is that from the pic I couldn't tell there was white stitching detail. Still a nice good quality shirt.
B0007O25X4|1|My husband has worn bucket hats for decades and was definitely due some good replacements. This hat was so tall, it looked like a stovepipe hat when he put it on and was extremely stiff. After several washings ( no wearings) we finally softened the fabric but it was still way too tall to be wearable. Very disappointing.
B00KVMQWP4|1|Not fleece but sweat pants material!!
B00M06QPRE|5|good!
B00GFD53XU|1|The actual dress was beautifully made, but it was HUGE. I sent pictures of my measurements (to show they were exactly the same as when I ordered it) and they tried saying the dress was a few sizes too big because I was wearing leggings and a bra when I had measured. Though they finally refunded me for the dress and shipping once they got the dress back, they would not reimburse me for customs charges. They stayed in constant contact, however, and all in all tried to be somewhat helpful.
B003EU9CYS|2|Dont buy this Item!! What I got was nothing like the picter that they show. It was a different color and hair style!
B006VE92US|4|It's nice
B00080M1OU|1|Good materials. Bad manufacture. The clear pocket for driver license came off on first use.
B00KCRCCUM|3|The jeans are truly just navy denim. There is no lights shading in the thigh like the picture shows.
B00K6ZSSSA|5|Adorable! Great quality!
B0050UYT7A|4|Great for nighttime motorcycle riding.Only a limited amount of wind gets through the sides.Would recommend to all real bike riders.
B00BQ95RNE|5|Really like it. I have a similar black belt from Eric Blaire. I wonder if it's the same thing. I do like the leather and the color.
B00KBLCS0S|5|Very very nice.  Sooo cute.
B001PU9A9Q|2|THIN is the key word.  Not great for someone who needs substantial coverage.  I rarely use these, and am not happy about needing to wet them down to keep them sticking.
B008SEBR5M|4|I like it a lot!, it's 2 or 3 dollars less than at any store at the mall. What I didn't like was that I asked for the black one and got a brown one instead! so be careful with that. Even though it's a dark color it is not what I wanted
B002UV4MBU|5|my son wore it for a long time. he looked really handsome in it :D
B00N4IDHTQ|4|Its fitted but will do. Thanks
B00OD2N70G|5|This was a gift for my son, and he loves it!
B00ARDD6PG|4|Is just the same in real...
B0045PTPGQ|3|Order 1 size up
B005LC63KS|5|I wanted full coverage and I got it. Padding is built in so it's nice not having to worry about losing it in the washing machine.
B00BJORGP8|4|This is really cute but be ware that it runs small....
B00CALRXV6|4|I bought it for my niece's first birthday and she used it almost immediately , and I think  doesn't fit her anymore.
B004Z5A9IO|5|They just looked skinny in the picture and I bought them even though they were for girls.  He was visiting for Christmas so he tried them on and what a perfect fit.  We couldn't believe it.  They really  were perfect and the waistband was adjustable so we could make them even smaller.  He is normal height but very thin.  His parents were happy to get these.
B009Y9QCCS|4|Too soon to tell.  The proof will be after multiple washings...<br />New, as expected.
B00AE8FJMM|4|It's cute but doesn't fit me like its pictured. Also i received the wrong color so I don't wear it much.
B00A6GAZHQ|5|great colors. ordered smaller size so it is more fitted. having lost weight and working out it fits well, also people love it. me too!
B009WW1VR8|5|Used as a gift. She loved it
B007PAUFLM|5|i had brought this to my boyfriend/father of my kids. one day i decided to wear it because it took him \\"time to wear it\\". it fit perfect. And wen he wore it he looked sexy. SUPER WARM!
B00JQIPNHC|5|It sea perfect! Thank you!
B004DEJJ88|4|Are you kidding me with those sizes?!<br />Ordered M, as I am shoe size 8. They were actually a better fit for my husband, shoe size 13. Had to return and get the small ones. Looked much better when I opened, so I tried them on. VERY comfy! Can't wait for my next barre class on Tuesday!
B00HHIA8J6|5|I was so happy when i got my order in the mail. When i tired them on i was so surprise with how comfortable they are and how good they felt on me. I would recommend these legging to anyone that wants some nice thick winter leggings that fit great and feel comfortable. THERE PERFECT!!!!!!
B0011FRH6S|5|I don't know why this costume got all the bad reviews? I expected a really cheap looking costume, but I was impressed with it when I tried it on. The material was stretchy so plenty of give, the zipper actually worked, and it fit just like the picture! I had none of the other problems described in other reviews. I mean for under $20.00, it was much better quality than my local party store would have sold for double the price, so I can't complain. Im glad I didnt listen to those other negative reviews!
B00A0GG2B0|2|The swimsuit seems to be made well but unfortunately too much of the stomach was showing. I will be sending this suit back.
B00GD0WG76|5|Color bright and beautiful, sizing true, length appropriate. This dress has a shine underneath and is age appropriate. Highly suggest buying.
B001E1AD4M|1|too big on the thighs. if you are a heavy girl, they fit well. The material is very thin. I have been a loyal Wrangler buyer for decades. I have many old Q-babies at home which fit so well. I have normal legs. Q-babies used to fit much more snug. now they have way more room, very baggy. They don't even seem to be the same Wrangler. Poor quality.
B00BEEFDE4|5|I love the color, the fit, and the summer weight.
B007I7Q7YG|3|This shirt is adorable but it is for a slim child.  I had size 22-18 month and it only fit my son quick enough for pics. My son is big for is age. But it is a slim cut shirt.
B00I9QG2TK|4|Very nice t- shirt, always been pleased with Salt Life shirts,
B009CCS06S|3|The socks are thick, warm, and soft; however, the material around the heel area appears fray after a few uses. The color around this area also fades.
B0058LTW1O|3|Very beautiful, but not flexible so it makes it difficult to breathe. Also comes in a smaller size than I would expect.
B005MX01P4|5|The mask looks great but I used this to do a skit and talking in it gets VERY hot, but it looks sooo good it was worth it.
B00D2M4JF0|5|I'm a petite small and this coat fit me perfectly, esp. because I plan to wear a sweater underneath. The sleeves were just past my wrist, which is fine with me. All in all, very happy with the fit.
B001PO6MLQ|4|This is a must for anyone feeling a bit naughty.
B00O3GVQ78|5|Cute shirt, bought for a Halloween costume, but will still wear it for regular use because it has a nice fit/style to it
B00C3M01WU|5|This shirt was perfect, we needed it on time for a cancer relay for life event and we were thrilled it arrived when promised
B001K3A1FU|3|For the price, it's okay, not great. I'm not thrilled with the material, but for a Halloween costume it will do.
B008G39C6Q|5|I purchase this hat to wear to a costume a party.<br /><br />  It looks just like the one that Tom Selleck wore on the Magnum P.I. Series.<br /><br /> I checked the net to try and find one for a good price. I searched around and found it on Amazon for a great price.<br /><br />  I decided to purchase it and was pleasently surprised when I received the item. . My friends even complemented me on the hat.<br /><br />  I would recommend buying this hat to anyone.
B0037Z36MY|5|I love these scrubs!  Great quality.  LOTS of pockets.  Good fabric.  Cute and comfy.  They stand up to anything but still look good.  I like the contrasting stitching.  I am 4'11&#34; so I still have to get them hemmed.  I wear these ever day.  They are a little lower riding on hips than waist, but are super comfortable!
B00JVN6TRK|4|The style is so forgiving I love it.  Usually wear a small with patty at  5'3&#34; 130lbs 34 b, but very glad I got a medium.  Though a small would have been ok.  4 stars because the straps seem a little wider than pictured.  Still very cute.  I should say I do have narrow shoulders, so that might be it.  Nice white not see through.  Very comfortable.
B00EOMA758|5|My son needed a Christmas sweater for a concert. This sweater is so comfortable he has worn it 3 times already and the concert isn't until Thursday. His said it is cozy.
B006HT4IAQ|5|Excellent
B00GQD3I90|4|This was purchased as an Easter present for my teenage daughter who is really into all music from the 80's.  The shirt came on time, and she loves it.
B0002GTFNU|4|My daughter loves this seat.  She has used it everyday since she was born and loves to sit up in it too.  My only gripe it that the buttons to switch the seat from reclining to more upright seem to stick a bit.  That is a good thing too though since my 2 year old loves to help me with her sister and has tried to sit her up in the seat.
B00D8MYKA8|4|Great case have it on my phone now
B0021WIXKY|5|This is an awesome sun hat!!  It fits great, looks great, and most importantly protects you from the blazing hot sun!  You will love this hat and I will definitely purchase another someday in the future; looks like this hat is going to hold up for a long, long time!!
B00CW9QB32|5|I ordered 3. Red, grey, and royal blue. I was very impressed with the quality.  They were thick and are fitted. So if you are looking for big and compfy this isn't for you. But they were exactly what I wanted.  I order a size bigger so I would be able to dry them.
B00J448VFE|4|A lil too loose it needs to fit snug
B00G2DLCZG|3|Pretty small, if your over 5'5 you really have to stretch them if your over 150lb they probably wont fit you that well /: they break pretty easy also but thats what you expect with these type of tights. cute design though
B00E5RWWJQ|3|Order a 2XL, but it runs a bit smaller than other Quiksilver shirts.
B00JLNHKBE|5|The scarf was a nice color, great price, very soft and came quickly in the mail. Happy with purchase.
B00LO9FLMI|2|Very cute pattern that's printed clearly, but I'm 5'3'' 130lbs and it barely fits! The material the shirt is made of is medium / low quality, and it's pretty itchy. I'm hoping a wash will fix this.
B0091FV15I|5|Have received great comments on the look and style.
B00068VI5W|5|My favorite slip. Super soft and comfortable and very light. So glad i found it.
B00GY745VS|5|Awesome shirt!
B00GS158CA|5|Great Shirt. Exactly as pictured. Looks and feels great as well. Mountain really make wonderful shirts.
B00CDB4Q2W|5|Pretty scarf purchased for my daughter.
B008TN2KSU|2|This is not like #76145, even though the picture looks similar.  It also has foam cups...not unlined.  Not a good substitute for the Vanity Fair Beauty Back Full coverage Underwire #76145.
B005VGIU9Q|2|-  Made for long, skinny fingers.<br />-  The very tips of the fingers are tightly tapered off in a way that makes them pinch the tip and therefore pushes the finger out.  So the glove always feels like it's about to fall off.<br />-  The back material doesn't bend or fold very well, and doesn't \\"grab\\" the hand.  It awkwardly sits loosely above the back of the hand in certain positions.<br /><br />Try it on in a store before you buy these gloves.
B00QCC9ARY|5|I love this shirt. It is very unique.
B00ARDD6P6|5|Great price for five onesies! Not sure wether my sister in law is having a boy or a girl yet so the neutral colors/patterns work perfectly.
B00KZ9XK1M|4|Love these pants! I'm 5'5, 160 lbs. Very athletic build and they fit perfectly fine. The only thing that kinda bothers me is the waist band is thin, but as expected in these style of pants. So super vibrant!
B00KDPS24I|5|Nice looking and fit the bill - I've been looking for good sun readers for two years and now have found them
B006WWY8YE|5|This dress arrived on time and was just so beautiful!  I wore it this weekend and i received so many compliments.  I felt very pretty in this.  I highly recommend this dress.  I wish it came in more colors.Thanks so much for making such a beautiful dress!
B001V6FRL4|2|I had read the other reviews that it was poor quality and whatnot, but I decided to buy it anyway.<br />The wig is cheaply made, didn't fit my husband's head, and was falling apart by the end of the night.<br />It didn't look as spiky or as full as it does in the picture.<br /><br />Rather disappointing.
B00ATOS6A8|5|I didn't get to see it but my daughter in-law said it was really cute and my grand daughter loved it!
B005LEUQCM|4|For the price I paid suits just fine. Its not a leather product, but suits just right for an eye qualification. I love that you can graduate the sizing of the belt.
B00FOSEUMW|5|I have gotten a chance to wear the socks and I can say they are great.  I was worried when I first received them that they might be too large but they fit like a charm.  They don't slip or move around when I walk and don't leave any uncomfortable marks some other low cut socks do.
B00YG8UU0C|5|I've ordered from 143 several times in the past, not only do they ship fast, but their products are always cute and affordable. I absolutely love these shorts, they perfect for just lazing about the house. I got a medium, they're loose on me like I like and not too short.
B00RB4YL26|5|Great would buy again
B00DDFISAS|5|I bought this for my sister and she loves it. She wears it everywhere and is always getting complements on it. It is a great gift for a Whovian.
B000B59X4S|5|I purchased this hat as a gift for my father.  He loves to fish and this hat helps prevent the sun from ruining a great day on the water.  He likes to use it to golf in during the summer months as well.  Good fit, light weight and good sun protection.
B00SM3JGAW|1|Not that great of a product. It is sized bigger than expected and is very itchy. Ordered a large and was more like an extra large.
B00L861IVK|3|Good, but it was way too heavy for me.  This is more of a rubberized fabric than a waterproof nylon so if you are using it in a warm humid environment, you will quickly sweat out. I had to get a sil nylon version instead.
B00541T7L8|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. Love the color, love the expression of faith, and love the inside. There not only is space for your checkbook, but also spaces for credit cards, ID, and a holder for a pen....love it!
B00LUMC3JS|1|Too small.  Fits like a large.
B003XOC9S6|2|I bought it based on the reviews. Although it has lot of sleeves, the ID sleeved is very loose and you may loose your ID if you are little careless. So to compensate, I put in a lot of other cards to hold the ID snug. And this defeats the purpose of slim wallet.
B0029ZC7AA|4|It's a tight fit, but it loosens up after wearing it awhile.  I wear a size 7 1/8. I think this unit is meant to be worn under the Carhartt hood on the jacket.  That's how I use it and it fits great under the hood.
B00MHOYDGY|4|This dress is very cute and sparkly. It does run a little small around the chest. My daughter is on the thinner side and is fitting perfectly in most size 4's but this dress was a little too tight under the arms. I will be exchanging for the size 5.
B00SVIKXSW|2|If you've got a big gut this vest might fit right.
B0007CKN6C|5|Good jeans at a good price.  Just what I needed.
B00GKGWG3C|5|Fits great, very comfortable.
B00421BOOO|5|It was a gift and she loves it.  The fabric is very soft. It is comfortable as well as pretty.
B001PO6JNW|5|I specifically bought this one because it doesn't have padding in the cups. Its pretty comfortable. Only complaint on the item is that it feels like the underwire goes up too much in the armpit area. Other than that, it feels fine, does the job, doesn't look hideous, isn't cut funny (i.e. everything stays where it should, even when bending over) and the price was very good.
B00APENNRI|3|Sleeves are waaaayyyy too short!!!!the body fit great ....very stylish and cute as I figured
B004YO7AV0|5|The nieces always play dress up, and my son was feeling left out, so I got the Power Rangers, because that way he didn't feel that way. And even now, after many uses, it's still holding strong. And he loves being the Blue Ranger..:)
B00AOGRXDM|1|Very cheap material.  Smells very bad from long term storage.  threading started ripping the second she put it on.
B00KHOY72G|1|The same exact dress as pictured. But advertised as &#34;plus size&#34;. A cute top, still oo small though
B00M1GYSWM|4|The shirt itself is very nice and the material is soft, but teh shirt is a little short. I bought it for my brother who is 6'4&#34;. I think it is going to be way too short...
B00U2R72SO|2|way to small. they were cute thoo
B00CQI02MK|4|I ordered a medium and it was a little larger than I expected, large enough to be a large. lol, but it is everything it shows in the picture and absolutely adorable.
B00D77Y8TM|5|Not only does the dress fit and look fabulous but the seller was so helpful! I have engagement pics next week and they helped make sure it would get to me in time, have already ordered other colors!
B009GWZH60|5|These are exceptionally comfortable and I will buy another pair in nude.  The stay put and fit very well.  They give that nice smooth look when wearing dresses that fit for the summer.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!!
B0092XN2MO|5|Awesome shirt! I use it for work, it's soft and well tailored and fits like a glove! Love it!
B00L57H0MS|3|I ordered a size up thinking he would grow into them but they are fitting just right. Did not seem to shrink with washing. Very cute though.
B005OYIVD0|4|FC Barcelona colors on my watch
B00CPKMDGW|2|This is an awesome color but it is see through and fits kind of sloppy.  I love the styling in the picture just not the same when you try it on.
B00AWM195Q|1|My wife and I ordered two of these shirts, a (L) and a (S) to wear to Comic-Con this year. We ordered two other Walking Dead shirts from another site at the same time, and were excited to get both orders. These shirts are of the poorest quality. The white shirt it is printed on is so thin and fits like a flea market shirt. After one wash, following tag instructions, the shirt looks like someone did pull-ups on the neck. The print itself is nowhere near as large and prominent as the pictures show. it is way smaller and the quality on the print also sucks. Before the shirt was even washed, you could pretty much see through the screenprint. It looks like they barely put pressure on it when they printed, and you can imagine how faded it looks after one wash.<br /><br />In summary, i wasted 40 bucks. I was looking forward to wearing these to Comic-Con, but now I will probably just wear it to mow the lawn.
B00AENBZK2|5|These socks are a well rounded package. They are unbelievably warm and comfortable and the design is cute! Would definitely recommend purchasing a pair to keep your toes happy!
B00GNU032Q|5|Loved it, so cute.  Fit great and got tons of compliments.  Was worried it wouldn't fit, but worked out great.
B00KHFULNO|3|I guess you get what you pay for, and I like them, and plan to use them to dissipate heat from my body when i bicycle, however upon opening the package and trying them on for the first time there was a very sizable rip on the inside of the left sleeve. For the record I don't have large arm muscles, so I doubt I was able to rip through them that easily.  I only have the option of returning them, as they don't offer replacements (something to do with the amazon fulfillment).  I'd rather not have to give up the pair I purchased to wait for a refund and then re-order the same thing.  Oh well, its only 9 bucks right?
B00EJW51UY|5|The color was exactly as it appears and is very good quality
B00UQTYU06|2|Fit as expected but material is too thin.
B004XAHGG4|5|I tried on this product in the shop and my wife started grinding on me right there and then. Incredible product - highly recommended. Thank you Columbia!
B00I9VV8UI|5|a little small but good quality
B00GLJA3PQ|5|Loved these so much, I got me another pair!
B00MVBT4EE|4|It's nice and I am just hoping the material will soften over time.
B00WHYRETW|1|This shirt is nothing like the picture whatsoever. It is completely see through and only goes to your elbows which makes the baggyness of it look absolutely ridiculous. Will never buy from seller again
B00SMOH0B8|5|It's a nice hat, and definitely cheaper than the ones you find at department stores. It fits my head a little small, but that's probably just my head and not the maker's fault. Worth the buy.
B00M0JMWWS|4|These are nice gloves that are slim fitting, actually work with the iPhone and are a little more stylish than the average isotoners.  I would say the M/L fit more like a medium/small. The iPhone does work with a little practice, and it's nice not to have to take them off in the cold to answer a call.
B00GP27I02|5|Awesome shirt, I wear it all of the time!
B002UDFWD0|3|I don't love this top.  The fabric has a very starched feel that I don't care for.  Maybe after a few more washings I will like it, but so far it hasn't changed from being washed.  Also, the fit is a bit strange.  I'm 5'7&#34;, thin but busty, and the small is too long and actually manages to make me look flat chested.  It isn't terrible, but I really only wear it when nothing else is clean.  It's a pity, because the flower detail is very cute.
B0038RFC6E|4|These compression shorts are effective and I was satisfied. I like their ability to wick sweat and dry quickly. They don't provide extensive \\"compression\\" per se but I use them primarily for long distance running to prevent inner thigh chafing and they work great for that.
B00QPVI0H8|4|I bought this for my 50s pin up theme bachelorette party. After a quick look over of the reviews I realized that if you are a larger breasted girl like myself you need to size up. Im 38D, 5'8&#34; So I sized up to the 2XL and it fit perfect except there was a small gaps on each size under my arms. It is a simple fix with a bit of tucking and sewing if you want it perfect or just throw on a sweater. Other than that don't let this dress turn you off. I really love it! Great material, ladies it's soooooo comfy and who doesn't like a twirl skirt?! Lol I will buy again. ^^
B00505DX22|2|Should state sizes are smaller
B00B97TOLY|4|My husband loves these for shoveling snow or running outside in the cooler temps.  Have not tried the microphone capability yet, but the headphones are great.  Very soft and comfortable.
B00JWUICAE|4|Quite comfortable - nice guitar selection - always gets a response.....
B00K6X6RTE|1|It's xl but it was tiny<br />Can't wear it
B00P7WLQ8G|2|Not what I wanted, but pretty coat
B00QW97Q6Y|5|took a long time to get here but I love them
B00DRAH3UK|4|good pair of jeans, I love it because fit the good way you look also I love this color. good ones
B00DIDAHLS|5|A Daddy & Mommy logo always keeps everyone happy.  The perfect gift.
B00NB1UOM4|5|Nice set. I bought it for a trip. Perfect!
B00LVQK6E2|3|Not happy!!
B00JANN4N8|5|oijnj;klijnl
B0076CNE8K|1|i ordered this two pack of medium boxer briefs and received only one in a size small. where is the missing one?
B005QEW5A8|5|It came on time and was just as it appeared online. Loved that it was brand spankin new, there was still paper over the logo. It was untouched and for a great price. Wearing it now. ;)
B0073DXQ6C|5|These are my favorite maxi dresses that I've found. They look exactly like the picture. The ruching and high waist are very flattering, and the detail on the neckline is pretty. I bought two and loved them so much that I bought a 3rd!
B00FXPX3FG|3|I like the style, but I wasn't impressed with the material because I received this top with a loose thread in the back. I will still wear it nevertheless
B00DE2I0ZS|4|No front pockets is my only complaint if they had those it'd be five stars
B00QHETWBG|5|Bought it for my son & he loved it! Great quality!<br />Came earlier than expected!
B004R1JTUU|5|The size fits well and the quality is all i expected it to be,  will by another when necesaay to
B0083IELVK|1|This product is not of very good quality.  Also, it is not nearly as large as advertised.  Save your money and buy something else.
B00CEH26Q8|5|The fit is right. I prefer high cut briefs now since low-rise bikinis have ruined my figure. Or maybe I ruined my figure by eating crap but either way low-rise bikinis do a disservice to my body and everyone's body unless you're super skinny. Anyway, I like the comfort of knowing that my belly is being covered by these briefs.
B00P2AES10|1|So much for one size fits all... They fail to show the back of the skirt in the photos. The skirt has a zipper in the back.
B00A0PYQE6|3|All good but size runs a bit small compared to all my other 36 especially with a stretch band
B00I0D9QPE|5|This is my second Krinkle chlorine resistant suit-the first one lasted almost 3 years until the inner lining fell apart.  I swim 4-5 times a week for 1-1 1/2 hours each time.  The color never fades and I love the tummy support.  Several other of the regular ladies at the pool have a Krinkle suit and are pleased as well.  JA
B00JA7R9NU|5|Very nice!!!!
B00KSF82RK|5|My son loves it he can't wait until he can wear it
B00KDGJPR0|5|Great product.! Love it !!!
B00U0X67JA|5|Gorgeous outfit!! Great quality, very happy. I am a huge fan of this brand.
B000JHER8U|3|Not as good quality as last pair. Will look for another brand with better quality.
B00B8KRCW0|5|the material is a little rough but the dress is so cute. i recommend. and i am happy with my purchase. came in time for xmas.
B00DLJFH3W|5|Well built. Functions as described
B00JGHN8ZW|5|Good likeness & arrived weeks early.<br />Fits perfectly, well worth the $.
B00POAL6DQ|5|fast delivery,item as described.I will re order in the other colors. Fit is accurate.
B000P4ZNSU|4|These pants will last at least one school year if not two. Unfortunately I bought them for my daughter and she doesn't like the way they fit her.
B007KFZEP4|4|Good quality product. I felt like it flattened me out more than I wanted. Definitely a supportive bra!
B00FYEZJY4|5|I was told that scrubs usually run large so I ordered this x-small for my daughter and it fits perfect!
B00C3UE8SA|4|Bought it as a gift, fit was as expected, any Ford fan will like this.
B00AHCK92K|5|My mistake on the size.Sent back and received a new pair. Just great to deal with.Will by more<br /> Jimmy K
B0052OHTSU|4|Be careful .. I have purchased the Spanx brand and like it - except for the price! I bought two of these - and they seem great, just had to replace the first order since it was way too small - and I ended up a size larger than I normally wear. But it's great! You should get it!!
B0056DKD6C|5|Great fit. Great price. Large is snug but not too tight for 6'3'' average build. Thick, nice material. Great undershirt or lounge shirt.
B00L8MQ9X6|1|I received a completely different pattern, but the right size!  Returned it.
B00ET1UXDK|1|I chose these because of the description and previous five-star review. I formerly had been a Hanes wearer, but I have 3 children and a husband for whom I also buy underwear, and I've noticed in the past year or so that the quality of Hanes seems to have been trending down, whereas FTL has been trending upwards, so that was a consideration as well. In general, I wear only darker colored cotton underwear, but avoid &#34;granny panties.&#34; The fabric on these is an alarming disappointment. The roughest cotton I have ever seen, and these are not dishcloths, but intimates, no less. They are a very loose, thin weave, and while the plastics may be covered, they are flimsy as well, and the sewing weak. The polka dots are not in the fabric, but merely stamp painted on, and the color is only on the outside, not through and through. Single layer fabric except for crotch. Never seen that before in grown up undies, but maybe it's cool in the heat?  It's too bad, as the cut is nice. Even in a multi pack, they are so cheaply made, they are very expensive for what you get. Now that I think of it, they kind of remind me of very generic little girls' underwear, so may be good for a teen or tween, but if you are a practical woman looking for something &#34;youthful&#34; these still are a big step down from what you may be used to.
B006FDFJDO|1|I've had the book bag for two weeks now and I picked it up today at school and it broke. That's why I rated it one star if it was my choice, I'd rate it no stars.
B004DNVP1S|5|Well made.
B00T48HCDC|4|My little loved it, but it I tried to order it a little big, and it turns out it runs on the small side.
B00IYOK0Z4|3|Not bad for the price
B00KFQOQVS|1|I wanted to love this bra. I liked how it looked online, it actually fit my larger bust size, and the price is great. But when I put it on, I found that the way the fabric folds underneath the bustline was super uncomfortable. It felt as though I had a t-shirt caught under the bra, but it's just how the bra is designed. Despite the fact that this bra actually fit me, I just wasn't able to get past how bulky and uncomfortable it felt so I returned it.
B008IGYPAY|5|My Girlfriend Loves it!
B004B8C2CQ|1|Very thin material, more fashion than function. Although it looks cool, I returned it due to the fact that it felt like it was ready to fall apart
B000MXWWBK|5|Great shirt- my son gets compliments all the time!
B00D90UKH6|5|I love it<br /><br />Posted publicly as ytkkb2014  
B00UL6HAN8|2|way to short  should be called a shirt in stead of dress.
B009VKMBKW|5|I've been looking for red underwear to give our 5- and 7-year-old daughters for New Year's Day. These are appropriate and soft. Since they are a gift, I'm not totally sure of the fit yet, but they look comparable to the girls' current favorite underwear. Just what I needed!
B00BMHTHBI|4|Not a perfect fit but does the job. I don't wanna be wearing much more under my shorts on a 100 degree day running outside. Keeps everything in place.
B00LN9PMSW|5|Material looks and feels good on my boyfriend and I approve of the color.  Nicely made and even though he's 6'1 they weren't too short which I was afraid of.  Fit more like a 20&#34; length.
B00GDIXR1C|5|As advertised
B004747Y4A|4|This hat is soooooo  soft..my daughter loved it..wish I would have  gotten  one for me.
B00822D6OK|3|Nice slip but too long!
B00DFN4R94|5|I love this dress. However, I was surprised by the length. I am 5'9&#34; and it was too long. Otherwise, it fit perfectly.
B00GWNSBVO|5|I usually don't buy clothes online, but I really needed a scarf to keep me warm around the house during these cold months. This scarf is lightweight, reasonably priced & well made! It's not terribly &#34;long&#34; (I am a short person) so that works fine with me!
B009TB18CK|5|Excellent hat -- well made -- I wish they had more colors.  My daughter loves it!  It's stupid that they require so many words.
B0089SX8FO|5|Nice shirt just make sure you go 2 sizes up. I wear US Med and i got the US X large
B005CSOVNC|5|I wanted a baggy and long hoodie to cover me when I wear leggings while exercising. I'm a tall woman so most women's tops do not cover me as much as I would like when wearing leggings. This sweatshirt is very long and baggy. Exactly what I was looking for!
B00T9A4LBQ|4|Some fit her just fine, some were just a bit small. They look very good though. Nice assortment of colors and each one had a different design in the lace. Overall, pretty good, just wish they were a size larger.
B003LNPB7A|2|I have a couple of these that I revieved from our local JD shop. this is not a quality shirt. it is thin and the neck was streched out. It will now be a night shirt for my wife instead of a shirt for me.
B008189036|5|I bought this shirt for my boyfriend & he loved it! when I put a picture of him wearing it on facebook everybody asked where to buy it (: its simply awesome
B002K6F7BE|1|cheaply made, exposed elastic band against your back and cuts is so high in back that it digs into armpit! (Also has a nasty odor out of the packaging)... Tried it on when it was too late to return.  FAIL!
B00KLMJ5D0|5|I loved this item!! Perfect fabric..looks exactly as the display pic!! I couldn't have asked for a better dress!! Thanks Jay Sarees!!
B007RB919G|4|love it
B0031ET0D0|5|Just got this hat for christmas and I am blown away on how great it fits and how comfortable it is. recieved many complements on it. thanks mom!
B007A2T8EU|5|My son loves them good fit great quality
B00AAKLF22|5|This cover is an exceptional value. It is very well constructed, very leather-like, excellent stitching...every little details is exact. Elastic bands lay very flat, slots for cards are not bulky, prop flap is secure when using it. It's exactly the look I was wanting and for the price, I was so very pleasantly surprised at the quality. Definitely recommend.
B00N3UDAQA|4|Nice quality, BUT this is a full belly panel. I was hoping for under the belly as described and shown. I wear a size 8 and ordered a size 32 here and it fit snugly (haha). I am 19 weeks. Hopefully it will last until I'm due. For the sale price, I'll take it.
B000JHCYU8|5|I'm 6'5 230 lbs fit well could have possibly went with 36&#34; waste
B004A7YLOK|5|i purchased this for my boyfriend and he really liked it!!
B0032PAIQQ|5|This artic black fox fur hat is the most gorgeous hat!  It fit perfectly, very well made.  Nice quilted lining, perfectly stitched leather top.  I can't say enough how absolutely fabulous and how much I adore it!  Every since I saw Dr. Zhivago as a tween, I've been in love with fur hats.  I get many admiring looks and also compliments.  Thank you Russia, with Love, an admiring fan of fur hats:)
B00D8UPGPS|3|NICE LOOKING PANTS, CUT ON THE SMALL SIDE. WAIST FITS GOOD, LEGS ARE SMALLER THAN MY OTHER JEANS.
B00B5OYQIW|1|Picture is blue and it saiz its pink so what do u get?<br />I had to cancel order cause i thought its blue butits pink.
B00QSO2O92|5|Im really happy with my purchase.<br />Thanks
B002GJ5IU0|5|Does not bring the shield, but my baby boy 21months is so excited about his costume.  He completely loves it and looks super cute. I order a size 3t because my baby is pretty big and it fits a little long, but that's it. I'm glad I order the bigger size.  Love love love the costume and it shipped pretty quickly got it 3 days sooner than expected.
B002D234EC|4|I needed to put the top over a chair and stretch it before I could fit into the XL  Normally I'm a size 10.<br /> With that under control  the 50's outfit was terrific
B00NXLGTAS|5|Love this outfit....my baby boy looks great in it, great quality for such low price.
B00A7R7G5I|4|I bought this for my 5 year old son but it turned out to be too big for him, so his elder brother s now  wearing it. Apart from that, the material is of good quality and soft.
B008POTU5Y|5|Great belt with cute bow.
B00E1ZORUO|5|Very comfortable, fit as expected, I recommend!
B00ABGL64C|4|My friend loves the wild socks I give him for birthdays or Christmas...the wilder the better for him.<br />He loves to wear them and show them off..
B00B803ZTE|5|Neff makes awesome products! Bought this to go boarding, super cute, love the bright 80's colors. Warm and comfy. Does the job right :)
B00Y1KZ5GO|3|A little small
B00UOY5UXO|5|Gorgeous color.  It is a bit more red than coral, very bright, but not obnoxious.  Length is perfect -- above the knee a little.  I am 5'6&#34;.  It can be worn for casual or dress up.
B001LK7DYO|5|This product fit well and kept the baby nice and warm all winter long. good product will order again in the future.
B00IPLKQ6O|5|They got perfect
B00FC43UE2|5|Nice quality and fit. I wish it was more stretchable.
B008DV25KG|2|The shirt is darling. the pants are way to small for a 3T.The material seems cheap also.<br />The sizes just don't seem to match the US sizes.
B00BZQ7ZPG|3|I very rarely return things to Amazon, but I am definitely returning this shirt.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Fits well. The sleeves are sufficiently long, the collar is true-to-size.<br /><br />2. VERY slim fit, which is perfect for me. I got the 15&#34; neck and 34/35&#34; sleeve, which has a 33.5&#34; waist. I actually have a 31 or 32&#34; waist. This shirt fits better than any other shirt I have ever owned.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />3. No breast pocket. No pockets at all on this shirt. What happened to practicality?<br /><br />4. Very thin material, zero insulation value. In certain lighting, you can see my nipples through the shirt.<br /><br />5. Spread collar. I don't like spread collars.<br /><br />6. The collar points do not touch the chest, they are raised a bit. This is great with long neckties, but it is terrible with bow ties.<br /><br />7. The bottom button is weird, it has dark thread and a horizontal buttonhole.
B00445WH4Y|4|It is very much too large from the waist down.
B000BTBPUE|5|My brother law loved it  , its light for Summer wear!
B00DHBJEM4|4|In spite of it being a one size fits all wrap around, I thought it could have been a little small. The fabric bunches a little on the side when I wrap it around and I am not a super skinny person. I am a size 4 - 6 depending on the brand. But I got many compliments when I wore this.
B00BU75JTY|4|I like the sweater very much. But the size is smaller than regular. I wear M. This one is L but still very tight on me . I have to leave the buttons open. Anyway, It is a very good sweater!
B00DXZIX9E|5|great product. Good fit and very rugged. I am sure that I will get a lot of use out of these
B0055T1NJI|3|The design is good<br />the buckle is a bit light for my taste
B00BPIMU2M|5|A little too big but it may be just me. Great buy I'm happy!
B00CIY3NUU|5|Very happy with my purchase I got so many compliments. Love it!!!!
B008ZSNWGS|4|it is a good color and good material. And  i like that the dress has the belt and this is the same color as dress
B00H3829TM|4|I like the colors - they were just not as pictured..<br />I bought them too large when I should have ordered my actual size
B00ATVITNK|3|good
B0051U182I|5|good quality
B00144N13E|4|This is a beautiful dress for a great price! As other reviewers noted the bust is very large--a nice problem for this well-endowed girl!  Overall the dress runs large so order a size down.  Nice shiney satin.
B008BAN9DG|1|Quality not good.
B00UHG3PO0|5|I'm glad I got the next size up with this! Nice fit and I feel very sexy in this
B000ZHGBU6|4|Have held up through a few wears which is better than most brands I have ordered. Would order these again.
B0041EI6P2|5|This was what I was expecting, a great fitted hat, great quality for a good price! I wear it casually, striped shirt and jeans and its what makes the outfits! Great formally or casually, just all around a bon hat!
B005G3Q5PA|1|These tights are awful.  I'm well within the medium suggested size according to the size chart and usually wear small or medium sized clothing.  However, based on prior reviews and because I really wanted these to work, I tried ordering up a size to a large.  So I know that compression hosiery aren't tons of fun, but these were terrible.  As other reviewers noted, the stomach portion of these tights are unbearably tight.  They fit - barely - over my stomach, but quickly started slipping down.  I tried folding them down, but it felt like my poor belly was being squeezed entirely too tightly to be safe for the baby.  They're going back immediately.  For those of you looking for full-leg compression wear, I would suggest looking at the compression recovery sleeves made for runners to wear on their legs post-runs.  Added bonus - they don't go up to your stomach, so wearing them while pregnant isn't an issue.  I've loved all my running compression socks and will stick to those in the future.
B00RT3R0HC|1|It is too small for me but not worth to return to the seller either. I will give it to someone who is very petite can fit in.
B00AZJKHSQ|5|I am so happy with these bras, (I have purchased various colors in this style) I wish they had more colors to choose from.  They fit so well and are well made.  I will be purchasing more of this brand.
B003E6SMYI|5|Fits my tall 8 year old just fine with some room to grow.  These were required for dance recital and I think she'll get a lot of use in the future.  Plus they are very soft.
B00G0MO59Y|5|I'm in love with these leggings omg I'm happy I bough  them even my uncle that it was a good idea so happy I got it
B00ME772QW|5|I love it!!! I'm super duper small and it's sooo hard for me to find clothes that fit right. I'm a size 0 I ordered a small and it fit perfect and it's comfortable. I recommend it for ladies that are small and short.
B002FOQFT4|5|Woolovers makes great sweaters at a great price!
B000WNTSUS|5|Amazing hat.
B00K9A1DOI|3|Great shirt.. But this is definitely not a 2T. Very small
B00CEHAUY8|4|I love the Desigual design and colour, as always. Though the fit is a little too snug on my hips.
B00080M1OU|4|A unique wallet with center pocket that allows cash to be out of sight if desired.<br />Thickness is fine, but length and width is larger than I'm used to in a stealth wallet.
B00ET0053Y|5|BLING IT ON..  I love this.. I know that there are reviews that this piece ravels...etc.. But COME ON.. It's mesh.. and sequins.  it's a delicate item.<br /><br />I will be purchasing more of these..
B00PGZ46CM|1|I am petite. Barely five feet tall and weighing in at 115 lb. This dress fit me like a shirt. And not a flattering shirt, either. The sleeves were really overwhelming considering the size of the dress (shirt). Sent it back. Did not work for me at all!
B00KDOPUN0|2|These run big. Disappointed on how they fit.
B00K7TTIRU|5|Excellent product, I am not sure about the sizes, but I am trying to get the right one for my nice that is 10 year old, I guess I will be giving this to someone else, because I love the color and is good material!
B007VAB0UG|3|Not as impressive as it is in photograph. Cloth quality is above average but still it didn't turn any heads, even on first wear.
B009FV9L14|5|Great
B009B5GGD0|5|Love it
B000GKKWQQ|3|Bra has a comfortable fit - not too tight or too loose, however once my shirt was on you could see where the top of the elastic cut in.  Did not make a seamless look.
B00CKKOEXM|5|Mom loved it.
B00WS1XZCE|1|Hate it, was looking forward to this shirt but when it came I was very very disappointed. Yes I'm a bigger girl but I ordered a 2X which normally fits. Wrong got the shirt and it's a crop too almost. Have it to my best friend who wears mediums and it fits her perfect.
B00856LFBE|5|I am so excited to wear these leggings!  I am only 5'10'', but it seems like all of the leggings available in stores are 2-3 inches short.  But I just got these in and they are actually a little longer than I needed them to be!  They fit great and seem like they were made well.  So worth the money!
B00JQADPAW|2|AT LEAST IT WAS ABLE TO FIT MY DAUGHTER.<br /> THE SPARKLE WAS PRETTY THOUGH.
B00ARIB5G8|5|These socks are comfortable and don't slip.
B00DQ2RE4E|2|The colour wasn't as strong as shown in the picture, and the size wasn't the true size, I have to give away as it was too short for me.
B008GWW75K|2|Doesn't tell you in the review but it has the phrase diva cut in the back. Something I would have liked to know before buying. I would have gotten something with a solid back.
B00IEZ0YFO|5|great
B00QRX61S4|3|I loved the style of the dress but the sides were to wide. I had to sew it so that my daughters chest wouldn't reveal through the side. I bought 2 of the same dress for my twins and I had to do it for both even though one of my daughters is heavier it was still too wide. Then after 2 hours with the dress on i noticed the hem falling off one of my daughters dress. I noticed that hem was sewn once without an end which is why the hem started separating from the rest of the dress. It's was horrible as I had to have my daughter seated the rest of the event. The other dress was sewn correctly. Even though I went through alot sewing the sides of the dresses and one of my daughters had a bad experience at the event she wore it, I still gave it three stars because the dresses did look beautiful. I wish I could get a replacement, but tickets were taken off and it was somewat worn.
B00CMLRDHS|5|just loves the color, goes with anything, thank you
B000JHENH0|1|I am not pleased with this jacket, one problem is that the zipper hangs up in the middle of the jacket. The liner is thin and does not stay warm as it should be. The zipper is not the heavy duty zipper that my other carhartt had. This may be a replicated jacket. Would return this jacket but it is the only jacket i have right now. Would not buy this jacket again.
B004T9X35M|5|I received these a week or so ago and I'm extremely happy with them. They are super comfortable and I move all day at work. I do not have a desk job. They keep me warm (our building stays cool due to other people being hot). I haven't discovered any uncomfortable seems like with other thermals. I will be buying my second pair on Friday.
B00FYWOP00|5|Looks good and fits as expected.
B00UJGMQ02|3|Purchased for myself. Fit my daughter.
B008QUOXUO|4|I love this red gown and thong and just have to see who else likes it *wink*. I would defintely recommend it to someone else.
B00T2QDHDK|5|Ordered acording to size chart,  it fits perfectly.  Did not go the extra size up.  I'm 5'11 and it was long enough for my torso.  Zipper is a little cheap, but that's expected.
B00SNBQCGO|5|These are by far the cutest pair of panties I  have ever purchased and I have a credit card with Victoria's Secret! They are the perfect shape, fabric and texture. The quality is top notch too. I only wish they had more colors so I could stock up! Love 'em!
B00MP3G77U|5|Very very cute!
B004S0DUNW|4|The length and arm length are perfect but this is very snug. I have an athletic build so it shows off my physique nicely but beware if you're not a fit person, this will hug you in all the places you are afraid to show at the beach lol
B00NWWZ4ZY|5|Cute shirt for my math minded nephew.
B005ITTBCG|5|This is one of the most wonderful product I have purchased.  It was given as a gift and received so well.  I am so pleased with this product.
B00IBD6K3Y|5|The shirt is soft and the print on it is hilarious. Very happy with this! Fits well and looks great; perfect for a good laugh.
B00M2OF1AQ|2|I love the look of this bra.  However, it does run small.  So, order a size larger at least.
B000XQ3864|1|These gloves are absolutely terrible! It had a huge hole in them when i took them out of the package! They are so thin you can see right through them and they definitely do not look like what the picture is!!!
B008D6OORS|4|Wore this under southern belle outfight, very comfy. I did cut the elastic at the bottom since it felt tight. My only complaint was that I thought it came in white.
B001T6F5Q8|3|The Bra fits well and very comfortable. I like the fact that the straps are adjustable, however its very difficult to adjust. I gave this sports bra three stars because I purchased a Wacoal Sport's Bra about 2 years ago and the quality was better.
B00NTX4HWC|5|Great sock, would buy again in the future.
B00M0QZ4OO|4|Great product, came out of first wash like new, runs a bit wide. Hours of fun as Superman for our 2.5 yr old. The detachable cape is fine, make sure to wash it inside out so the velcro doesn't grab other items.
B00N4C8QWK|5|Being a Corvette enthusiast I bought this shirt for my brother-n-law. As described it was made with a nice weight of material. I would recommend this shirt.
B004PBJ2UE|5|I purchased my bellefit before I had my baby, I started wearing it 2 days after I delivered, I started wearing on the first hooks and a week later i changed it to the tighter hooks, I absolutely loved it.  I've been going to physical therapy for my back because I got rear ended when I was pregnant and the therapist checked my abs muscles a month after delivery to make sure everything was going back into place correctly and she couldn't believe how fast my abs muscles went back to normal. I know they recommend to wear it night and day but I only wear it during the day and it is still giving me amazing results. I like it so much that I am ordering another one in a smaller size.
B002PU9VCQ|5|I ordered these in the heavenly pink and was so glad I did. They fit great and are the usual quality that you would expect with Levi's products. I love the back pockets  they have a sparkly button on each it's too cute! I like them so much I was thinking that I may order them in white as well.  Get them you'll be glad you did.
B00CZENO3Y|5|This maxi skirt is just exactly as pictured. Fits perfectly and is so comfortable. I've purchased other maxi skirts made from Azules and love them all.
B00RDFERK4|5|Awesome!! Perfect fit would order more, 6pack for the price you can't go wrong!!!
B000GZVJZY|3|The problem with this backpack is that the cover for the wheels keeps falling out so my seven year old ends up dragging it all over the floor..another thing is that the handle gets stock all the time and it's too long for a child..other than that, love the colors and it's roomy.
B004WKRAB6|1|These leggings look nice online, I ordered the black and gray leggings I got them in a 4x because thats what size I wear.... When I finally recieved them I immidiatly went to try them on and boy oh boy did I get a great big suprise after I worked them up my legs which was a huge mission I then attempted to get them over my thighs but that didnt happen those where the black ones now the gray ones I attempted to put on wouldnt even make it up my legs.... They are extremly thin, sizing is far from off and plus sized women like myself should spend money else where because these leggings are not for us!!!!!!!
B00WAJNBBO|5|Love it! perfect, great material.
B00I808FH4|4|Other than being a little to small they're great
B00KPOJVLK|3|Not a flattering fit for me as a petite person. Empire waist made me look frumpy.  Just generally not as cute of a dress as it may appear in the pics
B00LEX0FJS|5|Thanks for the item.
B00F57PLJ8|4|My daughter is a size 10 but we bought size 12 and fits her perfectly. The dress is pretty and well made.
B00NPYKVVG|4|Looks nice, lightweight good for summer.
B00A0PZBDG|5|Comfortable.
B006EXMLMM|5|This sleeper is extremely soft and cozy, and the artwork is lovely.  It has rapidly become one of our favorite sleepers for chilly Vermont nights!  However, it does seem quite small.  My daughter is not quite three months old (and in the 35 percentile for height and weight) and she is wearing the 6-12 month size.  We roll up the sleeves and it is baggy, but definitely buy a size up!  We have washed it a lot already and it's holding up very, very well.
B000AMHVDM|5|Fits great ... it's all that I expected and more.  Extremely comfortable and dresses worn over this garment hang nicely.  They don't catch or bind on the bodysuit because of its silky outside fabric.  Very nice.
B0009VQB9O|5|It's an act of faith to order a sports bra on-line if you have never had the exact one before. But this brand is true to size in different styles, at least for me. This is probably more bra than most women would like in a sports bra, but I like it, and wear it for every-day also. It's a good, all-around bra for every-day busy activities.
B008MQA7AC|1|Cheap and too small for adult with a small head.
B00IWBM1FQ|4|These fit as posted, but the material is a little thin. Not bad as long as I don't wear something bright red underneath. :-)
B00KUO9YOE|3|Great looking and feeling garment but it is not true to size. It was much smaller than the size indicated and I bought this and another a size too big.
B00KIE1BWE|3|It was just a little to big so I gave it away. I will still give 3 stars because the friend I gave it to loves it.
B00M70S6GQ|5|Adorable
B00JX73QHA|5|Loved the shirt.  Nice material! Awesome fit! SEXY!!! Washes really nice.<br />It is a definite recommendation for anyone interested in purchasing.
B00EZQ4LRI|5|These socks are great! They're the only ones we've found so far that both look good and have the grippies on the bottom.<br />Usually you end up with a mixed pack where some have grippies and some don't. For a toddler just learning how to walk, grippies are key!
B00JPP6G2W|4|I'm 5'10&#34; and 120 lbs. The medium fit my longer arms and body perfectly!
B00BB0TK36|5|These are always handy, and I lost one!  Yeah, it fell out somewhere!  Got to be more careful!  Didn't want to go out and buy again so soon!  Good quality - increases bust size.  I've found that putting baby powder underneath can keep you fresh.
B009TB1HIA|5|Love everything about it!
B005VYYAPQ|5|Love this jacket! It looks like it was made for my daughter's dress the roses on the side are a perfect match
B003VISFUK|4|The picture of this costume doesn't do the actual costume justice. This was really cute and relieved a lot of attention. It's really thick so it will definitely keep your child warm.
B00RAMA5N8|5|Great product.
B00K44IIGA|5|Fits perfectly. Fast shipping.
B00DONYXR6|2|But I ordered a 2X and it still runs small, not real happy, but will keep and give as a gift.
B00HYUJ4SI|2|Didn't like the material and the lining seam was out of sync with the seam of the dress, thus making it awkward to wear. It was also very small for size 10
B008HTPAVK|4|I usually wear a ladies medium, which is what I ordered and it fit just right.  Not too loose, or too snug.  It's just right for spring or fall.  It has a fleece lining which is too warm for summer, but perfect for weather in the 60 degree range or even a little cooler.  The color is beautiful as well.  I have a Russell Athletic sweatshirt I have had for 15 years which looks practically brand new after years of use, so if this sweatshirt lasts half as long, I will be thrilled.
B00ON8VBP8|5|Very cute.  My grandbaby looks so sweet in pink.
B00P6UXWWW|1|But very uncomfortable material t-shirt
B00QC6X5Q2|5|Looks good and fits nice.
B000KGKBOO|4|the name has a good reputation and it will last a long time..my husband also likes the thinner feel of it..
B00KIH7QNE|3|This dress has potential but it did run somewhat big. I am 5'2, 138lbs, and ordered an 8. A 6 may have fit better. It also had an ugly white panel in front and a cheap looking lace panel in back. However, it did feel really nice and had a decent quality.
B00HDOHNHE|5|Very, very nicely made and built to last! Love it!
B00NX8S10M|5|Love it
B00552HGPK|5|I looked everywhere for this type of product for my grand daughter to no avail.  I was very pleased to find them and at a fair price.  Better than putting tights on them or socks with dress shoes.
B00JXMMV1C|5|I recently graduated from EMT school and received this. It's sooo cute and fits great!
B00NQ3PCRY|3|The color was beautiful and the material and stitching was very well made.
B00DM0QVVC|4|the fabric is of good quality, also the neck looks like it wont wrinkle for a long time. The only thing is that it is big for a S shirt. It fits like a M form any other brand would fit me! Take this into consideration when buying.
B00EAZA3DU|5|Beautiful dress!  I love the red color and length of this dress!!  It is definitely perfect for me!
B005AKJRJA|5|All Lucky blouses are not created equal, but I do love this one .. soft, not see-through, and washes/travels well.
B00265KF7U|1|Very disappointed! Says it fit newborns but sized more for one year old. Do not buy this product!
B00KI3K0RM|5|This is just so beautiful... My daughter requested that I put her back to frilly-ish clothes... I showed her many outfits but what she was excited most about was this cardigan and its matching dress. The fabric is of a thin &#34;knit&#34; quality perfect for chilly Fall mornings but not overwhelmingly hot.
B00C731S8Q|4|looks real enough to get a laugh and totally wearable for 11-12 year old boys. not scary as it may appear
B0009HAKTK|1|This shirt is micro-thin and looks like it could tear very easily.  While it's nice own something with this \\"designer\\" name and at a low low price, it's completely impractical for day to day use. <br /> <br />Needless to say I returned this garment as soon as I received it!
B009753DXU|4|Great belt, really cute.  A little expensive for what you get, but that's fashion. Comfortable and easy to wear all day.  Does not wrinkle clothes (Some belts I have worn wrinkle my dresses more than others).
B00VOWVFTI|1|Material horrible. Too scratchy. Top fell apart. Granddaughter would not wear because said was uncomfortable.
B00HQVYDU4|5|awesome t shirt
B00QFKTV3G|1|Very bad, many threads
B002U4ZKCC|5|bought these to be used for Deaconess Day...loved them
B0013XWDFS|4|These are perfect for my purposes. I am smaller (B cup) and just finished radiation treatments, so one breast is very sensitive. These cotton bras are perfect to wear on my daily walks. One caution is that they are not supportive enough for jogging or running, but perfect for everything less active than that.
B00KSFE04E|5|love this onesie and want to buy all of them, super comfy and hilarious
B00DTWZ2B8|4|feels and looks great, however would suggest to order 1 size larger.
B00SI8KRG8|5|Cute!
B001P6BPJI|5|Nice quality!
B00ND7K6F6|5|Comfortable, soft, roomy
B00CBUSUBI|1|I need to return this item.., it was way to small. The material is good but the size is disappointing
B00DW4X0WG|3|These don't feel like jeans - they feel like leggings. The fit is tight - especially in the thighs. The waist does not bag. If you're looking for a pair of &#34;jeans&#34; that fit almost like tights - buy these.
B00BS6QY64|5|I've never been dissatisfied with NYDJ.  I know what I'm getting and I love all my NYDJ jeans.  I would buy the leggings a size smaller than you normally wear if you want them snug to tuck in boots.
B00RYGU65W|1|Shapeless and cheap Material
B00B1P3TK6|5|I purchased these slacks as an alternative to another brand to see how well they compare - I like  the fit. Well made for the price.
B00LMR1IIS|5|I love it. It fits well
B009V6M22S|3|Not sure &#34;vamanos&#34; was spelled &#34;vamonos&#34; in Breaking Bad.  It is still a good quality shirt and just quirky enough for my teenager to appreciate it.
B00HV7FDL6|5|Great deal!
B00KHCYWM8|5|great
B00N3RBM7C|5|My son loved it.
B00WAPL1QK|5|Love it!
B00J4TBCUK|5|Narly hat bro. Dude bro this hat got me so many babes I had to fight them off. I was like dude why are they all over me like this bro
B00KLV2SQW|4|Sleeves are larger than needed. Exact color needed for the job. Washes well and looks good on. I bought 4 more for my guys for Christmas and they love them. I love the price.
B00VHJ7AFQ|3|These pants are just OK.  They are too long for me (the inseam is 33&#34; and I am only 5' tall and usually wear a 291/2 or 30&#34; hem length - with heels).  However, the length isn't really a problem since I am used to making hems.  The problem is that when I went to pin these slacks to make the hem, I noticed that the leg lengths were totally uneven!  One leg was clearly about 3/4&#34; longer than the other.  So, they're going back.  :(
B001D6AUSW|1|When I purchased these assumed they were a regular fit in misses sizing because the description wasn't clear. When they arrived, the sticker said Slim Fit. I think they should put that in the description.
B00FAESPF8|5|This shirt is made of a nice quality fabric and is true to size.  The design is proportional to the fit.  Really cute!
B003AIKMKM|2|I just received these pants and there aren't any ruffles on them!  I absolutely adore Kicky Pants brand, the clothes are the softest bamboo for my baby, however I was super disappointed I ended up with a pair sans ruffles. I mean, aren't the ruffles the best part?  Grr.
B00C84YF8Y|5|I was nervous when my order arrived because the panties looked TINY!! I was like, &#34;you're joking right?&#34; BUT I tried them on and them on and they fit PERFECT! They are soo sexy! These are the perfect balance of sultry and sophistication- honestly! The front is super sexy! While the back is oh so adorable! They're cheap too but don't look cheap which I loved!! Probably getting them in all colors lol Also, they arrived in the time frame they were supposed to, so I was happy about that!
B00B6Z4MTI|3|After reading some reviews I picked a size larger than I normally use because of the slim cut - that worked out well and the jacket fits nicely.  It is well made.  My only complaint is a personal one of taste - after putting it on and looking in a mirror I decided I really did not like the look.
B00HJ165WA|5|excellent
B00O2BGVGK|5|Love this shirt.  Wish there were more colors.
B00FB34U2K|5|The best decision I made to buy this suspender. I love it and would buy another soon.
B0043O8NGM|4|These slacks are comfortable and true to size. My husband apparently does not like them on me though...I believe frumpy was the word he used. Maybe it's the name of the company that is skewing his vision, who knows.
B003RIU0DY|5|THANK YOU AMAZON FOR YOUR SERVICE RE DELIVERY TO AUSTRALIA OF MY COAT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY COAT I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN ON LINE
B006UJ3RD2|4|I had some RR at rite aid that I needed to use and saw this item on the shelf.  I thought, \\"why not.\\" I am currently nursing a 9 month old from one breast (the other one was so low in supply, it wasn't worth keeping)  so my breasts are no where near the same size.  I am a 32I on one side and a 32D on the other so I was in real bra trouble.  From the moment I put it on it was surprisingly very comfortable, but the bra pads were in a funny spot and peaked to the side.  I had to maneuver them to the front (which it seems you will have to do every time you put it on), but once I did it looks like I am wearing a normal supportive bra.  Me likey
B0045K96J2|5|Love it
B00D4KDQE0|5|My daughter turned 6 in December, so the &#34;larger&#34; fit may just be that she was a little thin going into the size 6 bottoms.<br /><br />This looked SUPER cute on her whenever she wore it.  I was expecting the pants to be a little thicker material, but they are more like leggings.<br /><br />My daughter managed to pull one of the front pockets off, but I think she worked on it for a whole day at school before it actually came off.
B002SCJXE2|5|Ok, I suppose I'll do a pros and cons style review, as boots are rather individual in that area.<br /><br />I bought the size 15 pair in OD green.<br /><br />Positively, I notice they are built rather tough, though a little rough. I can't help but like it, personally. They smell rather strongly of tire rubber when they arrive, and the soles are of very high quality compared to All-Mart's (see what I did there? all of them?) boots with really crappy foam rubber soles. They have much less ankle support than other boots I've worn, but I find I feel more comfortable being able to move my foot without as much resistance from my boot. For the money, I've never bought a better boot.<br /><br />However, they are rather stiff, and make my feet somewhat sore, requiring insoles (though most shoes and boots do for me). They are also rather prone to marking the floor, rather smelly to others (tire smell), and slightly long, as I ordered a size up to account for the lack of wide sizes.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them though, and am considering another pair. This coming from someone who usually prefers going around barefoot.
B00MNIICES|1|Ordered the 2x and it was smaller than an x-large also the print was peeling off the back. Cost more to return than the original price.
B00FPSVXS0|4|Really like the turtleneck.  Good quality for price...have gotten cotton ribbed in past but of course have to pay more but wanted new black that wasn't faded.  The neck is a little big but not a problem.  Over all excellent product for cost.
B00DV8S8YI|5|I love it. The shrug is perfect to size. I think the reason it has gotten so many bad reviews is that people do not realize these are junior sizes. The title is little confusing!
B003E386CE|5|I have an xl size head and this fits just right. It has a fall look but is some what light in weight so will work just fine in the southern climate. The bill of the cap is a bit longer than other caps I have,but no problem will work just fine on the golf course.
B00F93GLNS|1|Very poor quality. Asked for a refund but not worth it to mail them to China!!!!
B00K2Z13Q8|4|very nice but too small, my daught is three years old,it is too thin for her
B00GFSAP42|5|Beautiful dress!!! Love everything about it .... can't wait to wear it!  The material and quality is exceptional and the colour is gorgeous!
B00NS22GI6|4|I love the set! It matches my jacket very well. Hate that it does not have gloves to match.
B00MVJX55A|4|Great for the fisherman that just had a girl! Thanks
B00OMMX8WY|5|Love it! Get compliments on it everywhere we go. Colors are great. Product said it would take weeks to be delivered so figured it wouldn't make it by Christmas but then was at our house in less than 6 days. Other than that everything was perfect. Highly recommend for the little car lover in your life.
B00GWN7VKQ|4|Nice scarf.
B003LO2122|4|I have monkey arms and always have to buy larger shirts to get the sleeve length, unless you can find tall sizes.  Even in a tall, the shirts tend to be on the bulky side if your thinner like me.  This is a great shirt, nice clean fit, not too bulky, and plenty of sleeve length.  Well made and appears very durable.
B00LFKDSJE|5|Awesome dress
B00E4XQ09E|5|The quality is good
B0098VKD54|5|As described.  No issues.
B000A83G3A|5|The dress fits perfectly, my order came in 2 days earlier than what was expected, and I would recommend this costume to teenagers as well. The size fits just right. I can't wait to wear it for Halloween! :) [[ASIN:B000A83G3A I Love Lucy Classic Adult Costume - Adult Costumes]]
B009YZKHS2|4|The fabric is soft and comfortable. Lighter than a &#34;sweat&#34; - but, heavier than just jersey or cotton.<br />Perfect for those cool early summer mornings or evenings<br />The only &#34;down&#34; side is that the elastic in the waist band is not secured and tends to twist.
B00CFEO4WO|2|my daughter could hardly fit her head through it.
B005PA9A8I|5|These were great!  I am 5'10&#34;, size 12 and they are long!  Ended up giving them to a friend as were are going to an Abba copy band concert and dressing in 70's garb!  They fit her, too!  I would guess she's a size 14.  She needs to hem them as they were too long.  These fit great and are so comfy!  I was sure they were going to be too small.
B004D69ZRG|4|Provides a great deal of support and assists in removing water weight.
B00NZ8W5RU|5|i love the way it looks and feels.  real up date from basic blue denim<br />  its warm  . fits perfect.  i got the item fast. def.  a good item. to keep this hippy minded error guy updated<br />  and happy.  GOOD JOB  LEVIS !  GREAT SALES FROM THE DEALER.
B00JMC4IR8|5|I am 5 feet and 5 inches and 102 pounds, this fit me PERFECTLY! If you are a petite individual like me, you will absolutely love the fit!! :)
B003O2S7SS|4|This jacket was very suitable for me at Halloween 2012 and it fits with my slytherin robe. The best part of it is nobody notice a thing.
B002YCT1D4|5|Very good socks Thanks
B008U9P8G4|5|Fit my husband perfectly!  Looks great and is made from real durable material!
B00NER1PEQ|4|In love with my purchase. Need to have some of warmer material for winter, but otherwise great!
B00K8E8MQM|5|Amazon has a great selection of so many things.  Love you Amazon
B000PRFXF0|5|I am extemely pleased with the quality and style of this product. I purchased this product thinking that it would look great on me.  I am extremely satisfied.    Sincerely,    Valerie Magliocchetti
B0093Z6KSO|5|It is just like the picture. It is very comfortable. I am a size small or extra small and size 4 was perfect.I would highly recommend it.
B00L8D7C04|5|worked well as flower girl dresses.  the rosette detail is better in person than in the photo.
B007BFY8NC|5|Package arrived on time. The shorts are great material and are extremely comfortable. They are a little short in the rear if you have a big butt.
B001EM4A72|5|I opened the box a few minutes ago and found the most beautiful statue of Kwan yin, the goddess of kindness and compassion. I'm wondering who sent it to me, oops, I bought it for myself.  This statue is so beautiful, the detailing excellent.  It looks like a museum piece.  I couldn't be happier, it was well worth the price.
B00CII3KOA|4|It did take awhile to get this and when it came it smelled funny (the reason for 4 stars). That being said, this shirt is adorable and fit my daughter perfectly. I recommend taking it out of the bag and hanging it up for a couple of days if your giving it as a gift. That should take care of the smell.
B00T7CIOUU|1|The picture looks good on amazon but the product was not what I expected. It was like a picture of naruto and sasuke were cut out and ironed on the shirt. Whenever I walk it sounds like a paper bag. I am not a happy camper.
B00E7JTIU8|4|Much more comfortable than your standard wireless bras.  It's not lacy so it doesn't irritate the skin and the material is soft so it's comfortable.  It's a little tight, but I expect that it'll eventually stretch out over time.  I would say that it's comparable to the Ahh Bra, but it comes with inserts which I removed because they were annoying and shifted as you tried to adjust the bra.  I got the purple version, which is a little darker than it appears in the picture.  I attribute this coloring change to the lighting in the photo.  Overall, I like the feel of the bra, but it's definitely something you need to &#34;break in.&#34;  I don't recall needing to do this with the Ahh Bra, however this is significantly cheaper so it's a moot point.  Frankly, I would never pay full price for this sports bra and I feel like $10-20 is a more appropriate value for this product.  Overall I would say that for the current price of $8.38 this is worth buying over the Ahh Bra.  Anything over $15-18 doesn't make it worth purchasing over the Ahh Bra unless you want the inserts.  I'm not sure if I would advise going a size bigger since the material does eventually stretch.  I would go with the size that's one size down from your shirt size UNLESS you generally buy tighter shirts, in which case go with the same size as your shirt.  I fit in 3XL shirts, but prefer 4XL shirts since they're baggier on me -- I got a 3XL Bra and it fits properly, but they run a little tight at first due to the material it's made of.  Update 10/12/2016 -- This bra still has maintains its fit after a year of use.  It's still a tight fit and has maintained its original coloring throughout several washes.  No issues yet aside from being a little tighter than I'd prefer.
B008MHYGYY|4|worth the money . good buy . wish the front was longer what is probably called the fly
B00HN3HLMW|4|Love plaid...does not show stain so easily.
B005Q0IAZ6|5|Just what I was looking for a cute suit that hides my figure flaws.  I am comfortable and stylish.  This item was little pricey but worth it, I am sure I will where it for years.
B00TO76AG8|5|Very good
B000ROHO6W|5|My son needed to dress up as Albert Einstein for a school report. This worked great! He still loves playing with the wig :)
B003RYFIHG|5|I purchased this patch to sew on my paintball jersy for a scenario game I played re-enacting a Revoluationary War Battle.  However too many pinheads thought I was displaying my support for Tea Baggers.  It is a real shame that such a great emblem of American History has been taken over by political extremists.
B00B13B2J8|5|Excellent!!
B0059WA8T2|5|Great value for money.
B00ITI7EU4|4|If I had a smaller cup size, this would be great, but don't order it if you're larger than a C. I'm a G. I ordered a 2X, to try to get more coverage,  and I'm just keeping it in my drawer because I can't bear to throw it away.
B00P04637U|3|Thought it would be a thicker sweatshirt.  It's nice.
B0013K7BT4|1|I bought this for my son because he wanted to wear a renaissance costume for an upcoming Halloween party. I didn't have false expectations of this being a high quality product. In fact, I purposely looked for something \\"cheap\\" knowing he'd wear it once or twice and then banish it to the back of the closet. However, what I didn't expect was it to be so very thin (not much thicker than a pair of pantyhose) and stretchy (again, think pantyhose). It came stuffed in a bag and was excessively wrinkled. My son tried it on and while it was a bit smaller than expected he was willing to try to make the best of it; so all we needed to do was try washing & drying it to get the wrinkles out. That's when I noticed the tag says \\"DRY CLEAN ONLY\\" which was not mentioned anywhere in the seller's description. No way is this piece of junk worth the cost of dry cleaning. I would return it but the seller expects me to pay shipping both ways so it's not worth the postage. Suppose I could say I just bought myself a $20+ dust rag but the horrible stretchy fabric wouldn't even be good for that.
B00KZ1B468|5|Exactly what I expected. I'm 5'5&#34; and 120 pounds, would be able to wear under school dress code. Nice material, maintains shape well.
B00IEOZFJK|5|This dress arrived promptly, fit very well, and was cheaper than the original price tag on the dress. Definitely worth it.
B0020MMNTC|4|a good working pair pants
B0051U186E|4|As one who loves gray socks I was very hopeful when I found these.  Starter made a real nice gray XL sock a few years back but apparently no longer make the gray dual color socks.  These looked exactly what I used to get from Starter.  I have now washed them a few times and they hold up really well.  I am very pleased with the purchase and in fact I went back and ordered three more sets.  Thanks to Carhartt for understanding Men's feet these days can be bigger than size 12s.
B0091K2N6Y|5|all her friends loved it
B00H8ZQBDU|5|Happen to be relly comfortable and fit was pefect...very good price fornsuch a nice thick denim and very well constructed
B00FGCSDQA|4|I think the size is a tidbit smaller but otherwise my daughter loves it! It's more of the meaning and design of the jacket.Haven't tried washing yet. Quality is as expected for the price.
B00JEYSKL4|5|Shirt fits as expected. Great Quality. Sleeves a little smaller than expected but the rest fit perfectly.
B00KHX4CUE|5|I ordered the white in a small (I am 95 lbs and 5'6), it fit extremely well! Loved it, no complaints!
B00R4RQIZI|5|I purchased this wallet for my son. A must have for any die hard destiny gamers.  This is a green warlock wallet with a yellow tri symbol on it.  Its essentially a very basic wallet. One large center compartment for bills and a space for cards.  Getting cards in and out is a bit difficult but for the most part it works and looks nice.  Great gift item.
B00GS1RVT8|5|Great!!!
B00BZ3F3D0|1|I ordered the &#34;XL/US L (32&#34; - 34&#34;)&#34; size. I wear 34&#34; jeans. I couldn't even get these shorts on!<br />Love the style, but they would fit a teenager with a 30&#34; waist.
B00OFOHTOW|5|I just got this today and haven't had a chance to wear it out yet. HOWEVER, I've played around with wearing it a few different ways at home and I already love it. I know the listing says it's 100% acrylic but for some reason it smells very strongly of wool. Weird eh? I can tell I'll have to be very careful not to snag it on things and OMG, I will not be wearing anything with Velcro on it or carrying any bags with Velcro when I'm wearing it. It is so incredibly soft and it looks fabulous on. My only disappointment is that the darned weather is warming up and I'll be lucky if I get to wear it twice before putting it away until next season!
B00GDB8PLQ|4|I actually wrote a review immediately after trying this on because I loved it so much, but I deleted it, because I've now worn it twice and the second time a little of the love wore off. I love this bra because there are no seams, it's cute and supportive, but it's really too small. I'm actually getting more and more irritated with cleo panache bras because I've ordered four now and none of them fit the same. The bands are either too big or too small, and the same with the cups. What is their deal??? This one runs incredibly small--meaning, there must be almost a cup size difference. EVERYTHING is tight too, just like the other reviewer said. I had to adjust the straps to the loosest setting and wish they could be looser--a real first for me! The cups are nice and round which I love, but they also flatten me upwards creating a bulge along the top of the cups, leading me to believe the cups must be too small. I wish I could return this but I threw out the tag, thinking it was so cute I could live with the problems. Now I will have to. Plus I am so sick of trying to figure out cleo's incredibly inconsistent sizing. I love their quality and design of bras, but can they please just get it right!? I understand there is a difference between molded cup and unlined, but this is between two of the same kind. Meaning the Darcy balconette molded cup bra, which is the only one so far that has fit me true to size. SO, this is an awesome bra! But get a bigger cup size--possibly larger band, but I don't know--who knows.
B00603BVLI|5|I love this bra. It fits very well and doesnt get pulled up in the back.
B00AT90J6C|5|These are perfect for potty training.  Even after many, many washes even, usually in hot water, they are still in excellent shape.  No fading, fraying and waistband is still good.
B00C7XNEBK|2|These are more like 1 size smaller than mentioned, im a 36 and it feels like 34 and then no stretch at all, the material is also too rough, but each is their own
B00551OOOW|5|This 18 hour playtex bra #4608 is the most comfortable I ever had.  Even though I am petite the extra material is not painful to wear.  I almost forget I have a bra on.  Great support too.
B00JHGJ0UE|5|I found this jacket at Burlington Coat factory for $70. They had two sizes left in the store; Medium and Small. I spent 30 minutes trying both sizes on with various layers underneath. This is what I found:<br /><br />I'm 5'8&#34; tall and 160 lbs. and I wanted this Moto jacket to fit as slim as possible with no loss of comfort. I also wanted to still be able to wear both t shirt AND a medium-weight sweater underneath it.<br /><br />Generally with a &#34;slim fit&#34; jacket like this you will look your best and feel most comfortable with just a light t-shirt, preferably a Ramones vintage tee, worn underneath.<br /><br />For my body the Medium and the Small fit almost the same with a few key differences. The size Small fit me perfect in the torso and shoulders but was slightly shorter in the sleeves while the size Medium fit me exact in the sleeves but was too wide in the torso.<br />The faux fabric has a lot of stretch to it when you move. As a result the Small was better since the shorter sleeves could be pulled down and the back could be stretched out a bit. I also can easily wear both a t-shirt and a heavy sweater at the same time under the Small. So I went with the size Small. In fact the best way to describe the sizing of the Moto is the Medium fits like a normal medium but the size down from your normal size, in my case the Small, fits like a slim-Medium would.<br /><br />If I was heavier, say I was 170 to 200 lbs., but the same height range 5'6&#34; to 5'10&#34;, then the size Medium would be a better fit to wrap around a broader, rotund frame. Basically the jacket gets wider and sleeves get longer as you size up.<br /><br />That said the jacket is padded and lined on the inside so you will be warm down to 35 - 40 degrees F. Today was the first day of Spring in New York and was 30 F degrees with a lot of wind gusting and I was warm wearing  a medium weight t shirt and a medium weight G Star Aero  cotton knit sweater under the Moto. With a wool hat and thin scarf on I was very warm and also very happy to find the Moto jacket to be windproof when zipped up. As the weather warms up I will just wear t shirts under the jacket which is the ideal thing to wear with it.<br /><br />I got the Nickel Color which I didn't realize at the time of purchase was one of four color choices. From looking at the Amazon pictures the Nickel is the best color for the faux fabric. Black and Brown can look like cheap Pleather and Blue looks very odd if you don't know how to wear your Moto properly.<br /><br />With Nickel you can wear white, black, red or navy color T Shirts under the jacket and the colors all coordinate very well. I like the aged vintage look of the Nickel as well. Everyone asked me if I bought a new jacket but I could have easily have told them I found it in my Grand parent's basement  from like 50 years ago and most people will believe me<br /><br />The only gripe I have the faux zipper on the collar. I thought the jacket had a stow away hood inside the zipper but when I got home I saw the zipper itself is not real.<br /><br />For the sub $100 price offered this jacket is a steal. If you wear a lot of G Star or Diesel jeans with vintage style t shirts then this jacket will work very well into your wardrobe.Moto jacket to be windproof when zipped up.

B00BNZ3C2Y|1|How many people are going to buy this without a size?<br />Kind of important info don't you think?<br />Haven't seen too many one size fits all in the underwear!
B0074MPIGS|1|These were very poorly made for the price.  I had ordered two, to get the right size.  As soon as I took out the first one, felt the fabric, and saw how it was made, I repacked it and sent it back.
B0043T97WG|5|Great light weight jacket
B006GC67QW|2|Great colors and picture but has rough I'll fitting edges compared to my last one.
B00EALYR2M|5|Great skirt. Very versatile.
B000OWDON4|3|I am not a real fan of the racerback style when it requires being pulled on (and off) over the head. Hard when sweaty. Hard when having a larger chest.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a nice bra!!!
B00UHAL95I|5|Looks just like the photo and fits comfortably!
B00LVSB71G|5|Cute and comfie
B004EEA1I4|2|I normally wear an x large to 1x. This camisole is a 1x and It fits more like a medium to large.
B001NR8P60|5|I am very pleased with this tie.  It's of good quality and looks great in person.  The picture accurately portrays the color and pattern.
B00OHILYP6|5|Soft. Fitting/supportive.
B00BJTUHA4|3|The sweater is shorter and boxier than it appears in the picture. I've double checked the label to make sure it's not a petite, it's not but it hits right below the waist.
B001NEKD0Y|1|I ordered this bra based on the many positive reviews that I read on Amazon.  Much to my disappointment I am unhappy with this product.  First the bra has elastic straps and for those who are blessed with larger girls, elastic straps create bounce and jiggle.  Second the cups are not full coverage at all.  Yes, I have been professionally measured and know what my bra size is.  This one is just not for me.
B00OD9ZAH2|5|Good looking.  I made a mistake and did not verify that this buckle would fit the belt I purchased to wear with it.  Not the vendor's fault!
B00Q5KELL8|3|a bit too large, especially on waist size. If your normal waist size is around 32, go with small size, not as spec'ed M size.
B00J9LYWS2|5|good
B00IOB8036|5|Perfect! Love the material, it's fresh! And the color shines. Want to buy the other colors :) nice one try it
B0032YVLBI|4|great value and great style
B00ETN1ZR6|4|My grandson loves it but won't wear very much because it is getting too tight. I wish size choices were displayed
B00A3KG61O|5|This belt met just all my expectations, it is really good
B00J65T61E|3|I ordered Five different colors in 12 month size. When it came the sizing was different but  has 12 months  on the tag. I was disappointed.
B007OX49SK|3|Returned - product really looked good quality but really runs large. I was a gift but regretfully had to return
B00GS8GHU0|3|This brand runs very small I am usually a M/L (size 12) but I ordered an XL because it was cotton and even before washing it was very tight. The straps were very thin and rolled up because the fabric is very soft and the armholes were quite large.
B00C0ICE9U|4|Hard to get over over my kids head, other than that good hoodie, nice fabric, nice and warm. Kid loves it
B00LVS3IVI|5|The Wrangler retro and 20x shirts look and fit great in size LT.
B001AE6CPM|1|Is at least 4 inches longer than the last bought of same style and brand just a few months back. Not sure why.
B00GOHADAU|3|GOOD MATERIAL,THE SIZES CUT BIG
B00NNA38F8|5|This body shaper is my favorite and I own a few, I was confused as what size to order I contacted the seller and they were glad to help me. I love how this lifts my breasts and compress everything in tight making me look thinner and more blessed. The first night I wore this I was going out with my husband I wore a low cut shirt, his exact words were damn girl where did you get all that cleavage? When he pulled me close he said my waist felt smaller. This was really comfortable to wear. It didn’t irritate or leave marks on my skin and my skin wasn’t to sweaty when I took it off.
B00A3Q6168|3|The buttons all came off within a day of receiving the coat. I had to sew them all back on myself.
B00590FO84|1|These socks were low quality...Toe was thru after one wear !!
B00OBIQDUS|5|Very fast delivery, product as described. Love the shirt!
B00K7GEIQE|5|Comfortable and cute
B004PBKSUC|1|This is a total waste.
B007KQ2BRM|5|This is a large orange LEATHER ENVELOPE that is the size which easily holds NOTEBOOK PAPER. I needed two sizes of leather envelopes. One was to hold important papers inside the house and one was to hold my registration and Important Papers in my Glove Box that related to my car. I was not paying much attention to the size of this envelope when I ordered it; I thought I was ordering the smaller of the two envelopes I had in mind.<br />I was delightfully surprised when the beautiful Bright Orange envelope arrived at my front door. It will hold the papers which are notebook sized or smaller that I want to keep available in my home.<br />The bright color makes it easy to reach for the things you have placed in hiding, but want to be able to pick up at a moments notice: Passport; birth certificate, marriage licence...whatever is important to you. I keep my things in a fire safe and am very happy that I will be able to separate them based on color.<br />Why a Leather Document Case: Why not just use paper. The things I will be keeping in this Leather Case are things of value that will be ov interest or value for years to come. Look at the items make of paper that have come down to you that are printed on paper or made of paper that belonged to distant, now dead relatives. The paper ages over time and becomes discolored and friable. Items that you own, or were owned by relatives which are made of leather, are still usable. Well cared for leather that is kept soft with leather care items, made by shoe polish companies, will be around for hundreds of years. I ride horses and take care of my reins and sakes with leather soaps and cremes. Even my oldest saddles still shine and reins that I have had for years and years are still pliable. I was keeping my auto registration and insurance information in a plain paper envelope in my glove box, but I noticed that after being in the extreme Arizona heat for even a couple of year, this paper had browned and thinned. I decided on Leather at that moment. Besides, I want to be able to easily grab those automobile items quickly in the envent of an accident, or God Forbid, a visit by the Dreadded Motocycle Policeman!<br />I had never heard of RECYCLED LEATHER before seeing this Envelope. I assume it will require good care. One reviewer said it smelled funny. Mine did not. It smells like leather. Just in case, I will give this envelope an extra bit of care with Leather Renew prior to storage and will check it from time to time to make certain that it is holding up well. I see no reason why it would not. Leather is leather. But it depends upon how it was recycled. If just cut from a larger piece, there should be no reason for undue worry about this item. Good leather care is required for all leather pieces, old, new or recycled. So, when you are giving your shoes or boots a bit of upscale care, check on your orange envelope. If mine should crumble or show undue wear and tear, I will come back to this review and note that.<br />At present the envelope unsnaps easily and is soft leather which is nice to the touch and easily manageble. It opens easily when I want to put items in it and closes without a problem. With good routine care, I expect this envelope to outlive me and with NO Care at all, to survive easily into the next generation. With good care, my great, great grandchildren should be going around looking for \\"That Orange Envelope that Great Great Grandmother saved things in.\\" By then they should be whining that they are tired of Orange and should want some other color.<br />WHen I can buy some thing that durable for Less than Twenty Dollars, I consider it a great find. Now I will be hustling through Amazon's files to locate a smaller leather envelope to keep in my car. I am really happy with this purchase and if I find other items that require long term, bright colored storage, I will look to these leather envelopes as a source of bright colored, easily located, storage items that should last foryears and year.<br />A very Scougelike purchase for those of us who like to buy those things that will, with a bit of care, last or generations to come! This is a wonderful deal!!!!years and year.<br />A very Scougelike purchase for those of us who like to buy those things that will, with a bit of care, last or generations to come!

B001TJAPDI|3|It ran a bit small but it was doable for the time. Wish the lettering was bigger other wise it was ok
B00NIB6ICC|4|The color and fabric were not as expected. But it was made well.<br />Suggest some close up photos be included on the site.<br />Received on time.
B0006USFIS|5|this jockstrap is very good.the straps do not roll or flip and if the do the flip back by themeselves! i found when i was using the under armor jockstrap i was constantly fixing the straps in the back that kept on flipping this jockstrap does not do tht. the pouch is very generous and comfortable and is true to its size compared to bike.
B00O2VBJ9E|2|Runs very very small. At least 2 sizes off. The small ADULT might fit my 9 yr old niece.
B00NG8EF3G|4|The shirt fits my 4 yo great, but the shorts are super big around the waist! And there is no drawstring at the waist; only a little bit of white string at the front to make you think there's one.  I had to take in each side about 1/2 of an inch in order for these to not fall off my little boy!  Other than that, the quality looks good.
B00HE0U9UU|5|Good product. Good price
B005BEILQU|4|I am 5'10&#34; tall and a 34D, 29 inch waist, 36&#34; hips.  This fits me like a glove, i.e. perfectly.  Because the train is too big, I'm adding extra velcro to help it fit better.  Highly recommended for Halloween or a costume party or whatever.<br /><br />This is a costume, not a custom designed ensemble.  I read lots of criticisms below about this costume arriving wrinkled and wah, wah lots of complaints.  Give me a break, this costume is awesome.  It arrived on a hanger in a garment bag along with several pieces (boot covers, dress, hat) that were all packaged very neatly and nicely.  Some people complain for no reason and want the world on a silver platter, for a $1.50.  I'm a happy and satisfied customer.  One thing, I'm tall and I wear heels.  If you are shorter than 5'10&#34; and you get the Large, expect the train to be too long for you.  Give yourself time to adjust/alter before wearing it.  Or don't use the train.  The costume is more skimpy that way but still very nice.
B00S9QGND0|5|Perfect. It goes perfect with the blouse I have.
B0020MU3ZS|5|feels great
B002EZ0UTU|5|I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband.  He loved it.  It fit great.  I'm completely happy with it.
B00QFS667W|5|Best T i own
B008M10W3Y|4|This hat is comfortable and fits as well as expected.  I was able to have a Vietnam Veteran patch sewed to it.  Hat was purchased for wear during walks on hot, sunny summer days.  I am pleased with this headgear and would buy again.
B0055UAB1I|4|The hat is great for the price. I bought them to put my logo on for my bmx company. The hat is a 6/10 for quality. THE TOP PART IS WHITE! NOT GREY! It was very misleading but I is still a good hat.
B00GXNMUR4|3|Very happy with purchase
B00DQ4P886|2|Vest is OK but I found some for less, and did not have to pay the outrageous shipping which  added $12 which makes this a bad deal.  I will not be ordering anything where the &#34;shipping/handeling&#34; charge adds 25% to a price that was not all that good in the first place.
B00B0NH94Q|4|This is a high quality shirt and the graphics look awesome.  This one looks like it will be around for a while.
B006RS6CY2|5|I got these for my welder husband but he loves them so much we will wear them in the middle of summer and I'm unsure how he does not have a heat stroke. Good quality but they better be for the price.
B004A6CZR6|3|Generally all things Lands' End get top marks from me and I expected the same when we bought this jacket for my son.     Positive Things:   The good things are that it is attractive, super warm, has a nicely designed hood that actually stays up, has lots of zipper pockets, and the inside \\"stuff-it\\" pocket that is big enough to hold a hat and gloves. It is really great to have the zip out inner jacket, which is super soft. I like the idea of the \\"Grow-A-Long\\" sleeves, although we haven't needed to extend them yet. One of the nicest things about the jacket is that my six year old son is able to zip it up himself, which he wasn't able to do with his other coat.     Negative Things:  There aren't too many negative things about this jacket, but the one that I'm about to describe is a big one for us. The sleeves of the jacket are just too narrow. My son is very slim, so it is not a sizing problem, it is a design problem. Anytime my son has a sweater or sweatshirt on, he has to really work to get his sleeves into the arms of the coat without them pushing up his arms. Additionally, every time he takes the coat off, because the sleeves are so tight, he pulls the lining out and the sleeves end up inside out. Sometimes it even separates the  inner jacket's sleeves from the coat -- There is a Velco loop inside the sleeves that is meant to hold them together, but it isn't always strong enough to deal with the pulling that is necessary to get the coat off. Every time my son needs to put his coat on, even though he can zip it up himself, he needs our help (or the teacher's help at school) in order to push the sleeves right side out, to make sure the inner jacket is correctly attached and to put it on. The problem is manageable, just aggravating.     I suspect that this problem might be a result of the \\"Grow-A-Long\\" feature because of the extra fabric in in the sleeves, but I'm not sure. Another friend of mine warned me that her daughter had the same problem with the girls' version. The rest of the coat has generous sizing.     If you want to buy this coat, I recommend stopping by a Sears to try it on first and make sure you kid wears a sweater or sweatshirt. Then you can decide for yourself whether it is an issue for you or not.

B00DQ5JAZC|4|Grandson loves these shirts.<br />True to size.

B008AF0V9W|1|This says US-XL.  No way near.  I wear a 46 long.  I put it on and looked like Herman Munster.  This &#34;XL (Extra Large)&#34; is more like size 44 Regular jacket.  Otherwise, I'd keep it.  Great for the money.  1 star for clueless sizing.  The jacket is useless if it doesn't fit.
